00:00 - so now we will create a button animation
00:02 - and this is the button that is getting
00:03 - displayed over here and when we get the
00:05 - mouse cursor on this button as you can
00:07 - see this is the animation that we are
00:09 - going to create just with the help of
00:11 - plain HTML and the CSS properties so
00:14 - guys let us move to the vs code so let
00:16 - us create a new folder inside the HTML
00:19 - CSS projects so over here we will create
00:21 - the folder and we will name it as 07 and
00:24 - then we will say button animation in
00:27 - this case so guys basically this is the
00:28 - new folder that we have created inside
00:31 - this we will create our HTML and the CSS
00:34 - files so we have index.html file and the
00:37 - style. CSS file as well guys basically
00:39 - we have both these files over here now
00:41 - inside the index.html file we will make
00:44 - use of this Mt abbreviation that is
00:46 - exclamation mark and when we press enter
00:48 - as you can see we have this HTML
00:50 - template that is getting generated so
00:52 - over here for the title part simply we
00:54 - will say button animation this time and
00:57 - then after the title we will link the
00:59 - style. Cs file that we have created
01:01 - using this link colon CSS M abbreviation
01:04 - so guys basically we have to set the HF
01:06 - it is equal to the name of the file that
01:09 - is style. CSS file over here now guys
01:11 - inside the body tag what we have to do
01:13 - is we will make use of the a tag that is
01:16 - the anchor tag over here and we will
01:18 - have the class name that is button in
01:20 - this case so guys basically we are going
01:22 - to convert this a tag into a button and
01:25 - we will have the animation inside the
01:27 - button over here so guys we have set the
01:29 - text as whole over me in this case so
01:31 - guys let me just save this file now and
01:32 - let us start the live server over here
01:34 - from the bottom right so as you can see
01:36 - this is the link that is getting
01:38 - displayed that is having the text over
01:40 - me in this case now guys let us provide
01:41 - certain CSS properties to this a tag so
01:44 - that we can convert this link into a
01:46 - button so guys over here inside the
01:48 - style. CSS file first of all we will
01:50 - have the body tag over here so that we
01:53 - can have the button tag at the center of
01:55 - the screen so that we can get this a tag
01:58 - at the center of the screen in this case
02:00 - so let me just provide the display it is
02:02 - equal to flex and then simply we will
02:04 - say justify content it is equal to
02:06 - Center let me just save this file now so
02:08 - as you can see we are getting the link
02:10 - at the center of the screen over here
02:12 - apart from this we will also provide
02:13 - align items it is equal to Center in
02:16 - this case so as you can see we are
02:17 - getting the link at the center of the
02:19 - page as far as the horizontal alignment
02:21 - is concerned now guys what we will do is
02:23 - simply we will provide certain CSS
02:25 - properties to this button class over
02:27 - here let me just rename this class name
02:29 - to BTN because the button keyword is
02:32 - also reserved for the button tag in this
02:35 - case let me just rename this class name
02:36 - to BTN so that we don't get confused
02:39 - with the button tag inside HTML so guys
02:42 - over here we are going to make use of
02:43 - this class that is BTN so inside the
02:46 - style. CSS file we have the dot
02:48 - character followed by the BTN now guys
02:50 - over here first of all let us provide
02:52 - the padding of 10 pixels from top and
02:55 - bottom and 20 pixels from left and right
02:57 - in this case also we will have certain
03:00 - border over here so let's say we have
03:02 - two pixels of border which is of the
03:04 - type solid this time and then we will
03:06 - have the color that is 764 ABC as far as
03:09 - the hex color is concerned so guys this
03:11 - is the color that we are going to use in
03:13 - order to have the Border color and also
03:15 - the text color must be the same color so
03:17 - guys it is a best practice in order to
03:20 - copy this value of the hex color and
03:22 - save it inside a variable so guys over
03:24 - here inside the body tag we will create
03:27 - a variable that is button color over
03:29 - here so basically we have this button
03:31 - color variable and let us provide this
03:33 - hex color this time so basically this is
03:35 - the variable that we can use anywhere we
03:37 - want to make use of this color inside
03:40 - the body tag so guys over here simply we
03:42 - have to make use of the wear function
03:44 - and inside the wear function we will
03:46 - make use of this variable that we have
03:48 - defined that is button color over here
03:50 - remember that we have to provide two
03:52 - times Hyun while using the variable and
03:55 - also while declaring the variable over
03:57 - here either inside the root select or
04:00 - the body selector so let me just save
04:01 - this file now and let us see the Border
04:03 - over here so as you can see we are
04:05 - getting the border that is of the two
04:07 - pixels solid type this time now guys
04:09 - this text color should also have the
04:11 - same border color over here so what we
04:13 - will do is simply we will say color it
04:15 - is equal to where function and then we
04:18 - will make use of this variable so let me
04:20 - just save this file now so as you can
04:21 - see both the colors are same now and
04:24 - then apart from this what we will do is
04:26 - simply we will remove the underline by
04:28 - using the text decoration ation it is
04:30 - equal to none and also we will provide
04:32 - certain border radius so that we get a
04:35 - good corners for this particular button
04:37 - so simply we will have the Border radius
04:39 - of 20 pixels let me just save this file
04:41 - now so as you can see the link is now
04:43 - converted to a button that is getting
04:45 - displayed over here apart from this let
04:47 - us also provide certain margin from top
04:50 - so that we have certain spacing from top
04:52 - so we have provided the 50 pixels margin
04:55 - from top of this button now guys let us
04:57 - create the animation inside this button
04:59 - over here and before that simply if you
05:01 - want to change the color of the button
05:03 - you can simply come over here and make
05:05 - changes to this color so let's say we
05:07 - want to change it to some green color
05:09 - over here so when we change this color
05:11 - to Green let's say we are using this
05:13 - particular color let me just save this
05:15 - file now so as you can see the button
05:17 - border is now converted to green color
05:19 - along with it the text is also changed
05:21 - to green color over here so guys this is
05:23 - the way that you can make use of the
05:24 - variables and simply you can make the
05:26 - changes at one location so that the
05:29 - changes are applied at all the locations
05:31 - wherever you have used that particular
05:33 - variable so as you can see this is the
05:35 - color that we are using now guys apart
05:36 - from this what we have to do is we have
05:38 - to create a rectangular shape element on
05:41 - this web page so that we can create the
05:44 - animation for this button when we get
05:46 - the mouse cursor on this particular
05:48 - button so simply we will make use of
05:50 - this button class over here and we can
05:52 - make use of the seudo element that is
05:54 - before so guys basically this before and
05:56 - after seudo elements will help us in
05:59 - order to create new HTML elements
06:01 - without having to provide those HTML
06:04 - elements inside the HTML page so guys
06:06 - let us check that how we can do it with
06:08 - the help of the before pseudo element so
06:10 - over here we have made use of this
06:12 - button class which is representing this
06:15 - a tag over here always remember that if
06:17 - you want to create the new HTML Elements
06:19 - by using the before or the after sudo
06:22 - element you can do so only for the
06:24 - container tags you cannot do it for the
06:27 - tags which are not containers so let's
06:29 - say if you have the input tag which is
06:31 - not a container tag you cannot make use
06:33 - of the before and after sudo elements in
06:36 - order to add new HTML elements so guys
06:39 - inside the gurly braces first of all we
06:41 - have to make use of the content CSS
06:43 - property and simply we will keep it as
06:45 - blank over here that is double quotes in
06:47 - this case now guys apart from this we
06:49 - also have to make use of the position
06:51 - CSS property it must be absolute so guys
06:53 - whenever we are making use of this
06:55 - position equal to Absolute CSS property
06:57 - we need to have the container So
06:59 - currently the container is button class
07:01 - over here and we have to make the
07:03 - position as relative for this parent
07:05 - container this time so over here we set
07:07 - the position as relative and then for
07:10 - the position equal to Absolute we can
07:12 - provide the top left bottom or right CSS
07:15 - properties so where do we want this box
07:17 - to occur exactly over here at the top
07:19 - left corner of the button so simply we
07:21 - will say top it is equal to zero and
07:23 - also left it is equal to zero so that
07:26 - the top left corner of this particular
07:28 - new element is aligned over here at the
07:31 - top left of the button now guys apart
07:33 - from this we also want this element to
07:35 - have the width equal to 100% which
07:38 - should cover the entire button and also
07:40 - the height of 100% over here so simply
07:43 - we will say width it is equal to 100%
07:45 - And also the height CSS property is 100%
07:49 - this time and then apart from this let
07:50 - us also have certain background color so
07:53 - simply we will make use of the same
07:54 - color by using the wear function and
07:56 - then we will use this button color over
07:58 - here let me just say this file now and
08:00 - now if you see on the web page there is
08:02 - a square box that is covering the entire
08:05 - button over here now guys this
08:06 - particular square box is present on top
08:09 - of the button that we had already
08:11 - created so basically if we don't provide
08:13 - the top and left CSS property over here
08:15 - let us see what happens so we have
08:17 - commented out these lines of code let me
08:19 - just save this file now as you can see
08:21 - it is getting placed somewhere over here
08:23 - and not exactly at top of the button
08:25 - which is behind this particular
08:27 - rectangular box and then guys we also
08:29 - want this rectangular box to be present
08:31 - behind the button so what we can do is
08:34 - simply we will set the Z index CS
08:37 - property to minus one over here so that
08:39 - it goes behind the current button that
08:41 - is already present on the web page so
08:43 - when we save this file now it has gone
08:46 - behind the button over here and since
08:48 - the text color is also having that
08:50 - variable we are not able to make it out
08:52 - because the text color of the hover me
08:54 - text is also having the same color over
08:56 - here what we will do is instead of
08:58 - having this color simply we will set the
09:00 - color as white this time so when we say
09:02 - color it is equal to White you will be
09:04 - able to see the hover me text which
09:06 - means the button is now at the top of
09:08 - the rectangular box and when we remove
09:10 - the Zed index over here which is minus
09:12 - one now the rectangle shape is on the
09:14 - top of the button so guys this is the
09:16 - way that you can make the rectangular
09:18 - box that you have created by using this
09:21 - before sudo element go behind the button
09:24 - this time so guys when we save this file
09:25 - now so basically this particular
09:27 - rectangular box is present behind the
09:30 - button right now and then guys what we
09:31 - will do is simply I'll remove this color
09:33 - over here and UNC commmand this line of
09:35 - code and also we want the top and left
09:37 - to be zero so that the Box comes exactly
09:40 - on top of the button so let us remove
09:42 - these commands over here and then let me
09:44 - just save this file now so as you can
09:46 - see the box is exactly at the top of the
09:48 - button now guys we want to move this box
09:50 - on the left hand side and when we get
09:52 - the mouse cursor on this button over
09:54 - here the Box should come behind the
09:57 - button so that we can see the cool
09:58 - animation so what we will do is we will
10:01 - make use of the transform CSS property
10:04 - and then we will say translate X this
10:06 - time so guys basically this will help us
10:08 - in order to move the box and we will say
10:11 - 100% this time so let me just save this
10:13 - file now so as you can see the box has
10:15 - moved to the left right now and when we
10:18 - get the mouse cursor over here the Box
10:19 - should come behind this particular
10:21 - button so simply what we can do is we
10:24 - can make use of the hover Udo class over
10:26 - here so guys basically we will make use
10:28 - of this button class over here and on
10:30 - Hover event which means we make use of
10:32 - this hover class we want this portion
10:35 - that is before portion over here to come
10:37 - on the right hand side so simply after
10:39 - the hover Pudo class we will make use of
10:41 - the before pseudo element over here in
10:44 - this way and then after this what we
10:46 - have to do is the before element should
10:48 - move on the right so simply we will say
10:50 - transform and then we will say translate
10:53 - X it should go to the original position
10:55 - which is zero position over here for the
10:57 - x coordinate so when we say zero let me
11:00 - just save this file now and when we get
11:02 - the mouse cursor now on the button as
11:04 - you can see the rectangular shape
11:06 - element is now coming behind the button
11:08 - over here now guys we want the smooth
11:10 - transition this time so simply what we
11:12 - will do is we will say transition CSS
11:14 - property over here for the button class
11:17 - we will say all and then we will say 1
11:19 - second as the timing and the same line
11:21 - of code should be present for the before
11:23 - element as well for the button class so
11:25 - over here we have provided the
11:26 - transition all it is equal to 1 second
11:29 - now guys whatever changes happen to the
11:31 - button or the rectangular element over
11:33 - here it will happen with a transition of
11:35 - 1 second so when we save this file now
11:37 - and now when we get the mouse cursor
11:39 - over here as you can see there's a
11:40 - transition of 1 second that we can see
11:43 - now guys we also want to hide this
11:44 - rectangular element before we get the
11:46 - mouse cursor over here on the button so
11:48 - what we can do is simply inside the
11:50 - button class we will say overflow CSS
11:53 - property it must be hidden so guys
11:55 - whatever elements are present outside of
11:58 - the border of this particular button
12:00 - class will be hidden by default so let
12:02 - me just save this file now so as you can
12:03 - see there is no element that can be seen
12:05 - and when we get the mouse cursor over
12:07 - here as you can see this is the way that
12:09 - the animation is happening now guys when
12:11 - the element covers the button we want to
12:13 - change the text of the hover me that is
12:15 - present over here to white color so what
12:18 - we can do is simply we will say button
12:20 - class and then we will have the hover
12:21 - pseudo class over here and then we will
12:24 - have the color it is equal to white
12:25 - color let me just save this file now and
12:27 - now when we get the mouse C over here as
12:30 - you can see there is a smooth transition
12:32 - that is happening and the color of the
12:33 - overover me text is also getting
12:35 - converted to white color in this case so
12:37 - guys in this way you can create a cool
12:39 - animation over here with the help of the
12:41 - HTML and the CSS properties now guys if
12:43 - you want to change the color of the
12:45 - button simply as I have told you you can
12:47 - come to this variable and then change
12:49 - the color so let's say we want some
12:51 - version of the green color over here so
12:53 - let's set the color to green color this
12:55 - time and when we save this file now as
12:57 - you can see this is the button that is
12:59 - setting displayed on the web page and
13:01 - when we get the mouse cursor over here
13:02 - you can see the cool button animation
13:04 - that is happening so guys in this way
13:06 - you can set the required color based on
13:09 - your requirements as per the project so
