00:00 - so now we will create a very simple
00:01 - calculator with the help of the HTML and
00:04 - the CSS as you can see this is the
00:06 - simple calculator that we are going to
00:08 - create so first of all we are going to
00:10 - create a folder over here inside the
00:12 - HTML CSS projects folder so we are going
00:15 - to create the folder that is named as
00:17 - calculator since we are going to create
00:19 - a simple calculator over here now guys
00:22 - inside this calculator folder we are
00:24 - going to create the HTML and the CSS
00:26 - files so first of all we will create
00:28 - index.html file in this case and then we
00:31 - are going to create another file in
00:32 - order to provide the styling with the
00:34 - help of the CSS file so guys over here
00:37 - we have the style. CSS file as well so
00:39 - guys inside the index.html file we will
00:42 - have our HTML elements so we are going
00:44 - to use the Mt abbreviation that is
00:46 - exclamation mark in order to create the
00:49 - HTML template over here and for the
00:51 - title part we are simply going to
00:53 - provide the string that is simple
00:55 - calculator now because apart from this
00:57 - inside the body tag we are going to
00:59 - provide our code so what we are going to
01:01 - do is first of all we are going to
01:03 - create a diff tag with the class that is
01:05 - main class over here and inside this we
01:07 - are supposed to have the text area so
01:09 - for reference over here I have opened
01:11 - the calculator in this case that is a
01:13 - standard calculator so this box over
01:15 - here where all the numbers will appear
01:17 - will be represented by this particular
01:19 - text area so guys over here we will
01:21 - provide the text area is the name and
01:23 - the ID as well so I have provided the
01:25 - text area value for the name and ID part
01:28 - and then initially we will Prov provide
01:30 - the data as zero in this case now guys
01:32 - after this we are going to have another
01:34 - diff tag with the class container where
01:36 - we are going to Define all these buttons
01:38 - that you can see so guys we can create
01:40 - all these buttons with the help of the
01:42 - diff tags over here so we are going to
01:44 - have the diff tag with the class Row in
01:46 - this case and every button will be
01:48 - represented with the help of this
01:49 - particular class that is row over here
01:51 - so guys first of all we have this button
01:53 - that is C so in this case let us provide
01:56 - the data as well and I'm simply going to
01:58 - copy this line of code over here and we
02:00 - are going to provide other buttons at is
02:02 - C and then backspace and then we have
02:04 - divide so guys over here for the clear
02:06 - part we will provide the capital x
02:08 - letter and then over here we will
02:10 - provide the Divide symbol so guys
02:12 - basically we have created the four Tex
02:14 - with the help of the class that is row
02:16 - over here which we are going to use
02:18 - inside the style. CSS file let me just
02:20 - save this file now and try opening this
02:22 - file on the browser so simply I'm going
02:24 - to copy this path over here or simply
02:26 - you can also use the live server feature
02:28 - so basically you can install the live
02:31 - server extension on the vs code that
02:33 - will help you in order to go live over
02:35 - here so guys simply we can use this
02:37 - feature as well so let me click over
02:39 - here on the go live Button as you can
02:41 - see so it is starting right now and
02:43 - basically by default this will be the
02:45 - URL where your server will be live and
02:47 - you will be able to view the HTML web
02:50 - page now guys whatever changes you make
02:52 - in the HTML and the style. CSS file over
02:55 - here will be reflected on this HTML page
02:58 - so over here we have not defined the CSS
03:00 - file to be linked to this particular
03:02 - HTML page so simply we are going to use
03:05 - this link tag over here along with the r
03:07 - attribute that is stylesheet and the hrf
03:10 - attribute will have the style. CSS file
03:12 - the file that we have created over here
03:14 - in order to define the CSS properties so
03:17 - guys let me just save this file now and
03:19 - the changes will be automatically
03:20 - reflected over here now guys what we
03:22 - want to do is we want all these buttons
03:25 - that is having these particular text to
03:27 - be present on one particular row over
03:29 - here and also we want them to have
03:31 - certain background color along with the
03:33 - fixed width and height so guys what we
03:35 - will do is first of all for the main
03:37 - class that is for the main calculator
03:39 - over here we will Define certain CSS
03:41 - properties so let's say we Define the
03:43 - background color as a yellow color for
03:45 - the entire calculator and we want it to
03:48 - be present at the middle of the screen
03:50 - over here so guys what we have to do is
03:52 - let us also provide certain padding of
03:54 - 20 pixels so let me just save this file
03:56 - now and without actually reloading the
03:58 - page you will see see that the changes
04:00 - are now getting reflected on this
04:02 - particular URL that's because of the
04:04 - live server that we are using now guys
04:06 - what we want to do is we want to have
04:08 - the fixed width of this particular
04:10 - calculator so let's say we have the
04:12 - width of 40% over here as far as the
04:15 - entire width of the screen is concerned
04:17 - so as you can see this is the 40% let us
04:19 - reduce the width to 30% over here so as
04:22 - you can see this is the 30% width and
04:24 - also in order to get this particular
04:26 - calculator at the middle of the screen
04:28 - simply we can provide Mar margin equal
04:30 - to Auto over here so guys when we
04:32 - provide margin equal to Auto let me just
04:34 - save this file now and as you can see
04:36 - now the calculator is getting displayed
04:38 - at the middle of the screen over here
04:40 - now guys let us provide certain CSS
04:41 - properties for this diff TX in such a
04:44 - way that all these elements are
04:46 - displayed in one particular row over
04:48 - here so what we have to do is we need to
04:50 - use this particular container class in
04:52 - this case so guys let me just correct
04:54 - the spelling of this container class
04:56 - over here and then inside the style. CSS
04:58 - file we need to make use of this
05:00 - particular class that is container and
05:02 - then guys we need to provide the display
05:04 - property it is equal to grid that's
05:06 - because the layout that is getting
05:08 - displayed on this calculator app it is
05:10 - in the form of the grid layout over here
05:12 - so guys similarly we are going to make
05:14 - use of this grid layout in this case let
05:16 - me just save this file now and if we see
05:18 - the changes there are no changes right
05:20 - now that's because only one column is
05:22 - configured by default and that is why
05:24 - all the diff tags are coming inside just
05:26 - one column over here in order to
05:28 - increase the number of columns we need
05:30 - to make use of the grid template column
05:32 - CSS property and then for this
05:34 - particular CSS property we need to
05:36 - provide the width of the columns so guys
05:38 - either you can provide some length
05:40 - measurement or else you can also provide
05:42 - the auto keyword so that the width of
05:44 - the columns is taken automatically and
05:46 - since we need four columns over here in
05:49 - order to provide the buttons inside the
05:51 - calculator in the form of the grid
05:53 - layout we will be providing the auto
05:55 - keyword four times over here so when we
05:57 - save this file once again and if you
05:59 - notice is the changes over here as you
06:01 - can see all the diff tags are now
06:02 - getting displayed on just one line and
06:05 - they are separated with the help of the
06:06 - columns inside the grid now guys apart
06:08 - from this also we want to provide
06:10 - certain CSS properties to all these
06:12 - buttons which are represented with the
06:14 - help of the diff tag over here so let me
06:16 - just copy the class name that is Row in
06:18 - this case and then guys what we will do
06:20 - is we will provide the fixed width and
06:22 - height over here so let's say we have 40
06:24 - pixels of width and then also the 40
06:26 - pixels of height in this case so we
06:28 - provide the height attribute as well and
06:30 - also we want to provide certain
06:31 - background color so let's say we have
06:33 - the background color as gray color over
06:35 - here so when we save this file you will
06:37 - see that these are the changes that are
06:38 - getting reflected in this case we have
06:40 - all the columns that are getting
06:42 - displayed over here and we have the
06:43 - fixed width and height for this
06:45 - particular diff tag apart from this we
06:47 - will also get these characters at the
06:49 - center of the box over here so what we
06:51 - will do is simply we will provide the
06:52 - text align it is equal to Center and in
06:55 - order to get the letters vertically
06:57 - aligned we can provide the line height
06:59 - attribute as well so simply we will
07:02 - provide the line height attribute in
07:04 - this case which must be equal to the
07:06 - height of this particular row class so
07:08 - it is 40 pixels over here when we save
07:10 - this file now so as you can see all the
07:12 - letters are now getting displayed at the
07:14 - middle of the button guys we can provide
07:16 - a lighter version of this gray color
07:17 - over here so let me just change the gray
07:19 - color to this particular lighter version
07:21 - so when we save this file now as you can
07:23 - see these are the buttons that are
07:24 - getting displayed now guys let me just
07:26 - zoom in little bit so that we can see
07:28 - the calculator prop properly over here
07:30 - as you can see these are the top four
07:32 - buttons that are getting displayed over
07:33 - here now guys apart from this also we
07:35 - want to align this content inside the
07:37 - text area at the right hand side so
07:39 - simply what we can do is we can have the
07:41 - text area tag over here and simply we
07:44 - can provide the text align attribute so
07:46 - in this case we will provide text align
07:48 - it is equal to right over here so when
07:50 - we save this file as you can see now the
07:52 - number is getting displayed on the right
07:53 - hand side okay similarly what we will do
07:56 - is we will have these numbers and also
07:58 - the multiplication icon over here inside
08:00 - the second row as far as this container
08:03 - is concerned so simply we have to come
08:05 - inside the index.html file and I'll copy
08:08 - these lines of code over here and simply
08:10 - we need to provide the content that is 7
08:13 - 8 9 and then multiplication so over here
08:16 - we will provide seven s the number then
08:18 - 8 and then N9 and then this
08:19 - multiplication s the small X letter so
08:22 - let me just save this file now and if
08:24 - you notice a change over here as you can
08:26 - see these are the buttons that are
08:27 - getting displayed on the second row now
08:29 - guys apart from this we can also provide
08:31 - certain row Gap over here so that there
08:33 - is certain Gap in between the rows in
08:36 - this case so simply inside the CSS file
08:38 - for the container class we can provide
08:40 - the row Gap over here and a row gap of 5
08:43 - pixels can provide a good amount of Gap
08:45 - in between the rows so when we save this
08:47 - file now as you can see we have caught
08:49 - the gaps in between the rows now now
08:51 - guys apart from this we will also
08:53 - provide the other numbers as well so let
08:55 - me just copy paste these lines of code
08:57 - once again over here inside the HTML
08:59 - file file so guys we have the third row
09:01 - over here inside the container and this
09:03 - is how the buttons look like in this
09:05 - case apart from this let me just quickly
09:07 - provide the last two rows over here as
09:09 - well inside this calculator so guys as
09:11 - you can see we have also provided the
09:13 - last two rows over here and apart from
09:15 - this we have also adjusted certain width
09:17 - of the main class and the text area as
09:20 - well in which case we have provided the
09:22 - number of columns and the number of rows
09:24 - in such a way that it aligns better
09:26 - along with the other buttons over here
09:28 - inside the container now guys what we
09:30 - can do is in order to make these buttons
09:32 - look more decent we will provide the
09:34 - background color of white for all these
09:36 - numbers over here so simply for the
09:38 - numbers inside this calculator we are
09:40 - going to provide another class name that
09:42 - is number in this case and then guys let
09:44 - me just copy this class name to the
09:46 - other numbers as well so that only for
09:48 - these numbers we are going to have the
09:50 - white color as the background color and
09:52 - then after providing the background
09:54 - color as well we are going to also have
09:56 - the hover Pudo class that will change
09:59 - the backround color when we get the
10:00 - mouse cursor on the buttons over here so
10:02 - simply inside the style. CSS file we
10:05 - will provide the number class in this
10:07 - case and then guys we are simply going
10:08 - to provide the background color of white
10:10 - color over here let me just save this
10:12 - file now so as you can see we have all
10:14 - these numbers with the white color in
10:16 - this case apart from this we can also
10:18 - have certain borders as well so guys as
10:19 - you can see we have the white colors for
10:21 - all these numbers right now apart from
10:23 - this let us have some different shade of
10:25 - white color over here so basically we
10:27 - are going to have this shade of white
10:29 - color over here so as you can see this
10:31 - is the background color now guys when we
10:32 - get the mouse cursor on this particular
10:35 - row that is the button we want to change
10:37 - the background color to some different
10:39 - color in this case so what we can do is
10:41 - for this row class over here simply we
10:43 - are going to have the hover Udo class
10:46 - and inside this we are going to have the
10:47 - background color so let's say we want to
10:49 - have the background color as gray color
10:51 - in this case let me just save this file
10:53 - now so now if we get the mouse cursor
10:55 - over here as you can see it is changing
10:57 - the background color to the gray color
10:59 - which means it is giving some feedback
11:01 - to the user that this is the button that
11:03 - is going to be clicked in this case
11:04 - apart from this also we will provide the
11:06 - cursor it is equal to pointer over here
11:09 - let me just save this file now so as you
11:10 - can see the cursor is getting updated to
11:13 - the pointer icon over here we can have
11:15 - some other version of the gray color as
11:17 - well based on your requirements so let
11:19 - me just change it to some lighter
11:20 - version of the gray color over here let
11:22 - me just save this file now so as you can
11:24 - see the buttons are now getting a
11:26 - different background color in this case
11:28 - so guys based on your requirements you
11:30 - can have the different background colors
11:32 - or any other CSS properties with the
11:34 - help of these class names just like how
11:36 - we have defined inside the CSS file over
11:38 - here guys we can also have multiple
11:40 - class names for a particular HTML
11:43 - element as you can see these numbers are
11:45 - having two class names over here and
11:47 - from two different class names we are
11:49 - having the multiple CSS properties and
11:51 - the CSS property that is defined at the
11:53 - later stage inside the external CSS file
11:56 - will be implemented on the user
11:58 - interface that is on the web page over
12:00 - here so guys in this way we have
12:02 - successfully created a very simple
12:04 - calculator with the help of the HTML and
12:06 - the CSS properties comment in the
12:08 - comment section below whether you have
