00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to convert a string to a
00:06 - float or integer so guys this Python
00:09 - program will help you to convert a
00:11 - string to the integer of load values
00:13 - using the end to end float methods which
00:16 - are used as a prefix methods with a
00:18 - parameter that is the string data type
00:20 - so guys we are going to check all these
00:22 - with the help of examples as well so
00:24 - first of all we will see converting a
00:26 - string into the integer data type so let
00:29 - us move to the vs code over here so the
00:31 - very first thing is let's say we have a
00:33 - string variable that is the Str and then
00:36 - the data that we want to provide is 1500
00:39 - so guys let's say this 1500 is the value
00:42 - that is the number but it is of the
00:44 - string data type because we have
00:46 - enclosed it within the double quotes
00:48 - over here so what we will do is first of
00:50 - all we will print the statement that is
00:52 - the Str data type over here so Str data
00:57 - type polar and then comma we can simply
00:59 - have type method in order to get the
01:02 - type of the Str so inside the type
01:05 - method we provide a parameter that is
01:07 - Str in order to get the type of this Str
01:09 - variable so let me just keep this file
01:12 - now and try running this code so as you
01:14 - can see Str data type it says class SDR
01:17 - over here that is a string data type now
01:19 - guys let's say we want to convert it
01:21 - into the integer data type so what we
01:23 - will do is simply let's say we have the
01:26 - Str followed by underscore and then we
01:29 - will say end in this case so that we can
01:31 - identify that Str end variable must be
01:35 - of the integer data type so what we can
01:38 - simply do is we can use the int method
01:40 - over here as a prefix so over here we
01:43 - can have the int method it will take the
01:45 - parameter and this parameter will be
01:47 - this Str variable which means we are
01:50 - passing this string over here so simply
01:52 - I'll copy this and paste this over here
01:54 - so basically this string that is Str
01:56 - variable is being passed as a parameter
01:59 - to this individual variable now guys
02:01 - this string that is 1500 will be stored
02:03 - as the integer into this Str end in this
02:07 - case so let us check the data type of
02:09 - this Str end variable as well so we have
02:12 - print statement followed by Str
02:14 - underscore n and then we can simply have
02:18 - data type over here colon and then this
02:21 - time we will have the type method and
02:23 - inside this we will provide Str in in
02:26 - this case so that we get the type of
02:29 - this Str end variable so let me just
02:31 - save this file now and try running this
02:33 - code once again so as you can see Str in
02:36 - the data type it is of the class in data
02:39 - type in this case which means it is an
02:41 - integer now guys what is the difference
02:43 - over here we have the 1500 as the value
02:46 - which is the string value and then over
02:48 - here in the Str end we are having it as
02:51 - a number in this case so let us check
02:54 - what is the difference what we will do
02:56 - is simply we will have the print
02:57 - statement and then we have SDR and then
03:00 - this time we will do plus 1 over here so
03:03 - we are just having the plus operator
03:06 - over here but this is the Str variable
03:08 - which means it is of the string data
03:10 - type and we are adding one to eight so
03:13 - over here it should do string
03:14 - concatenation which will give us the
03:17 - result as one five zero zero one in this
03:20 - case but what if we add 1 to the integer
03:22 - data types over here let's say we have
03:24 - another print statement and this time we
03:27 - will be using the Str underscore end and
03:30 - then plus and then one over here so guys
03:33 - what this will do is since it is having
03:35 - 1500 as a number value that is the
03:38 - integer value it will add plus 1 which
03:41 - means it will give us the result as 1501
03:43 - this time so let me just save this file
03:46 - now and try running this code once again
03:48 - so we are getting the error can only
03:50 - concatenate Str not end to Str so over
03:54 - here what we can do is simply enclose
03:56 - this one inside the double quotes over
03:58 - here let me just say this this file now
04:00 - and try running this code once again so
04:02 - as you can see we are getting fifteen
04:04 - thousand and one over here which is of
04:06 - the string data type in this case but we
04:08 - are getting 1501 for the second case
04:11 - where we have added 1 to the integer
04:14 - data type over here so guys this is the
04:16 - difference between the integer and the
04:18 - string whenever we are using the plus
04:20 - operator in case of string it is doing
04:22 - the concatenation whereas in case of the
04:25 - integer it is adding the two numbers
04:26 - over here now guys what if we have a
04:28 - decimal number inside this double quotes
04:30 - so over here let's say we have 0.04 in
04:34 - this case so what will be the result so
04:36 - let me save this file now and try
04:37 - running this code once again so as you
04:39 - can see it is saying invalid literal for
04:41 - end with base 10 so guys in this case
04:44 - what we can do is we can convert the
04:46 - string into the float we can also
04:48 - convert the string float numeral to
04:51 - integer over here so guys basically we
04:53 - can first convert the string to the
04:55 - float number and then to the integer as
04:57 - well so first of all we will check the
04:59 - second upper approach in this case what
05:01 - we can do is simply so I'll just remove
05:03 - these lines of code over here and then
05:05 - I'll comment out these lines in this
05:07 - case and then we can have another
05:09 - variable that is Str followed by
05:11 - underscore and then we have load and
05:14 - then similarly how we had used the int
05:17 - function we can use the float function
05:19 - over here as well in order to convert
05:21 - the string to the float so we provide
05:23 - strsc parameter and then we can have the
05:26 - data type of this Str float in this case
05:29 - so over here Str and Then followed by
05:33 - underscore float data type it is and
05:36 - then we say type and then Str float in
05:39 - this case so that we get the data type
05:41 - of this Str float so let me just save
05:44 - this file now and try running this code
05:45 - once again so as you can see Str flow
05:48 - data type it is of the data type float
05:51 - and then guys we can also print the
05:53 - value so we say and value is and Then
05:58 - followed by comma and simply we can have
06:01 - Str float in this case so let me save
06:04 - this file now and try running this code
06:05 - so as you can see we have got the value
06:07 - as
06:09 - 1500.04 this time now guys we can also
06:12 - convert this float number into the
06:14 - integer as well just by using the end
06:17 - function in this case before the string
06:19 - of load so I'll just provide the end
06:22 - function inside this print function
06:24 - itself so over here we have used the end
06:27 - function while printing the Str float in
06:29 - this case so instead of
06:31 - 1500.04 we should simply get 1500 this
06:35 - time because we are converting it into
06:37 - the integer value so let me just save
06:39 - this file now and try running this code
06:41 - once again so as you can see we have got
06:43 - Str flow data type the data type will be
06:46 - float only but then we are converting it
06:48 - into the integer while printing it so
06:51 - that is why we have got the value as
06:53 - 1500 this time so Guys these are certain
06:55 - ways in order to convert the string data
06:58 - type to the integer and the flow data
07:00 - type now guys it becomes very important
07:02 - when we are taking the input from the
07:04 - user so let's say instead of this fixed
07:06 - number over here we provide the input
07:09 - function and then we ask the user to
07:11 - enter the number so basically when the
07:13 - user enters any number over here it will
07:16 - be of the string data type which we can
07:18 - convert by using the end or the float
07:20 - function over here just like how we have
07:22 - seen in the examples so guys let us save
07:25 - this file now and try running this code
07:27 - once you will be able to see what will
07:29 - be the Str data type over here once a
07:31 - user enters any data over here so when
07:34 - the user is being asked to enter the
07:36 - number let's say we provide
07:39 - 1400.45 SC number when we press enter as
07:43 - you can see Str data type is of the
07:45 - string data type over here so whatever
07:47 - data is being provided by the user it is
07:50 - of the string data type now Str float it
07:53 - will be of the flow data type that's
07:55 - because we have converted that string
07:57 - into the float and then the value it
07:59 - will be of the integer data type that's
08:01 - because we have converted that float
08:03 - value to the integer value over here so
08:05 - guys this is a way that the string that
08:07 - was entered by the user can be converted
08:09 - into the float or the integer values as
08:12 - well which becomes very important
08:13 - whenever you are writing the python
08:15 - programs so guys please make sure that
08:17 - you practice on your own so that on
08:19 - different inputs you get different
08:20 - outputs make sure that you like this
08:22 - video so that it reaches to more people
08:24 - and subscribe to this channel so that
08:26 - you get the notifications on upcoming
08:28 - videos as well the next video that we
08:30 - are going to talk about is Python
08:32 - program to get a substring of a string
08:34 - so stay tuned
