00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to learn about making text
00:04 - strikethrough in HTML using the strike
00:06 - tag so guys anything that appears within
00:09 - the strike tag as you can see we have
00:11 - the strike opening tag and the strike
00:13 - closing tag over here that content will
00:16 - be displayed with the strikethrough
00:18 - which is a thin line through the text so
00:21 - guys let us understand this with the
00:22 - help of example now in the vs code over
00:24 - here so guys previously we had seen how
00:27 - we can make the text as bold or strong
00:29 - or Italy sized and underlined now we can
00:32 - have another paragraph over here so we
00:35 - will have the P tag and inside the speed
00:37 - tag we will say this text is stripe in
00:42 - this paragraph So guys basically this is
00:45 - a very simple paragraph that we have
00:46 - written it has a single statement that
00:48 - this text is striked in this paragraph
00:51 - let me just save this file now and try
00:53 - reloading this page over here you can
00:55 - see that this is a very simple paragraph
00:57 - over here without any formatting now
00:59 - what we we will do is we will make these
01:02 - three words at this text is Strike which
01:04 - will have a strike through so what we
01:06 - have to do is we just need to enclose
01:08 - these three words in between the strike
01:10 - tags so over here we are going to have
01:12 - the less than symbol and then we will
01:14 - type strike and then we will have the
01:16 - greater than symbol over here and what
01:18 - we have to do is this ending 10 we just
01:21 - need to cut it and paste it after the
01:23 - striped word over here so guys let me
01:25 - just save this file now and try
01:27 - reloading this page so as you can see
01:29 - text is striped is being displayed in
01:31 - the form of a strikethrough over here
01:33 - you can have any single word or the
01:35 - multiple words display with the
01:37 - strikethrough based on your requirements
01:38 - now guys if you notice in this code this
01:41 - strike word is being colored with the
01:43 - red color so basically this means that
01:45 - this strike tag is being deprecated in
01:47 - the latest version of the HTML so in
01:50 - HTML5 you can simply use the S tag so
01:53 - instead of using the strike tag over
01:55 - here we can use S tag so as you can see
01:58 - the S Elementary represents contents
02:01 - that are no longer accurate or no longer
02:03 - relevant so this will have the same
02:05 - functionality similar to that of the
02:07 - strike tag so we will replace this
02:10 - ending tag as well with the S tag over
02:12 - here let me just save this file now and
02:14 - try reloading this page once again so as
02:16 - you can see we are getting the same
02:17 - output over here these three words are
02:20 - being striked through using the S tag so
02:22 - guys basically the strike tag is
02:23 - deprecated and we must use the S tag
02:26 - over here in the latest version of the
02:28 - HTML please comment in the comment
