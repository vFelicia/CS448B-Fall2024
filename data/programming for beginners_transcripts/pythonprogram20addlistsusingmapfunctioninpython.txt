00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to add arrays using the
00:06 - map function so guys let us move to the
00:08 - vs code over here in order to write this
00:10 - Python program so basically we are going
00:12 - to have two lists over here that is list
00:14 - one it is equal to we will have the
00:17 - numbers that is 1 2 3 and then four and
00:19 - then let's say we have another list that
00:21 - is list two so again we are going to
00:23 - have some array of numbers over here
00:25 - let's say we have 5 6 7 and then eight
00:27 - now guys let's say we want to add both
00:30 - these arrays that is both these lists so
00:32 - the first element that is one should be
00:34 - added to the first element in the second
00:36 - is that is 5 so the result should be 6
00:38 - and then 2 plus 6 the result should be 8
00:41 - and so on the corresponding indices in
00:44 - both these lists should be added in
00:46 - order to find the result list over here
00:48 - so guys we can simply achieve this task
00:50 - by using the map function so over here
00:53 - what we can do is we can have the map
00:55 - function and the first parameter will be
00:57 - the function in this case that will be
00:59 - executed by this map function so over
01:01 - here let's say we provide the anonymous
01:03 - function that is Lambda over here it
01:05 - will take two numbers that is one number
01:07 - from list one and then another number
01:09 - from list two over here so we have X and
01:12 - then comma Y in this case which will be
01:15 - the two numbers from both the list and
01:17 - then after this we have colon and simply
01:19 - we can do X Plus y over here so this is
01:22 - the result that will be returned from
01:24 - this map function now guys the second
01:26 - parameter that we need to provide is the
01:29 - list over here so second parameter will
01:31 - be list one and another parameter will
01:33 - be list 2 from where these values will
01:35 - be taken into X and Y so guys over here
01:38 - we will provide list one as the second
01:40 - parameter and then the third parameter
01:42 - will be list two so guys basically the
01:45 - first parameter will be the function
01:46 - over here we have defined the anonymous
01:48 - function inside the map function and
01:51 - after the first parameter inside the map
01:52 - function we have all the iterables that
01:55 - is list one and list two from where the
01:57 - data will be coming now Guys these
01:59 - results needs to be be stored in a
02:00 - particular variable so what we will be
02:02 - doing is we have the map result over
02:05 - here so we have map underscore result so
02:07 - all these results that is 1 plus 5 which
02:09 - is equal to 6 it will be stored in this
02:11 - map result then we have two plus six
02:13 - three plus seven four plus eight so all
02:16 - the results will be stored inside the
02:17 - map result over here then guys simply
02:20 - what we can do is print this map result
02:22 - so while printing the map result we need
02:24 - to convert it into the list so over here
02:26 - we will simply have the list function
02:28 - and then we can simply provide the map
02:30 - result variable so let me just copy this
02:32 - and paste this over here so guys this is
02:34 - the way that we can add all the elements
02:37 - from list 1 and list 2 and display the
02:40 - results on the console so let me just
02:42 - save this file now and try running this
02:43 - code in order to confirm the same as you
02:46 - can see the first element we are getting
02:48 - 6 which is 1 plus 5 which is equal to 6
02:50 - then 2 plus 6 it is equal to 8 and 3
02:53 - plus 7 is 10 and then 4 plus 8 it is
02:55 - equal to 12. guys you can also achieve
02:58 - the same task by using the phone for
03:00 - Loop and adding each element from both
03:02 - the list one at a time and storing it in
03:05 - a third list variable so that is another
03:07 - way that you can try out as a homework
03:09 - for you but this map function helps you
03:11 - in order to write very less number of
03:13 - code and to achieve the required task by
03:16 - providing the iterables and the required
03:19 - function which is having the required
03:21 - expression over here so guys please
03:22 - practice on your own so that on
03:24 - different inputs you get different
03:25 - outputs make sure that you like this
03:27 - video so that it reaches to more people
03:29 - and subscribe to this channel so that
03:31 - you get the notifications on upcoming
03:32 - videos as well the next video that we
03:34 - are going to talk about is Python
03:36 - program to find even numbers in the list
03:38 - using the filter function so stay tuned
