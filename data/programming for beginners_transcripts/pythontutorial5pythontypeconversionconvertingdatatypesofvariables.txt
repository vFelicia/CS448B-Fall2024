00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about python type conversion basically
00:06 - we are going to learn about converting
00:08 - data types of variables so type
00:10 - conversion is the process of converting
00:12 - data of one type to another so for
00:15 - example converting string data to
00:18 - integer so guys it can so happen that
00:20 - you have got a number in the form of a
00:23 - string and before you add it to another
00:25 - number you need to convert that string
00:28 - data type to the integer data type so
00:30 - how do we do that by using the python
00:32 - type conversion so basically there are
00:34 - two types of type conversion in the
00:36 - python the implicit conversion which is
00:38 - automatically done so this is automatic
00:41 - type conversion so basically when this
00:43 - automatic type conversion happens is
00:45 - whenever you are converting from a data
00:48 - type that is of small size to the larger
00:50 - size let's say integer data type it
00:53 - takes four bytes as the memory but the
00:56 - float it takes 8 bytes as the memory so
00:59 - what will happen is over here whenever
01:01 - you are going to add integer along with
01:04 - the float the result will be stored in
01:06 - the float itself that's because you are
01:08 - going from the integer that is having
01:10 - the lower size to the float data type
01:12 - which is having the larger size over
01:14 - here so guys in that case automatic type
01:16 - conversion happens in order to avoid the
01:19 - data loss and there is another type of
01:21 - conversion that is explicit conversion
01:23 - in which you have to convert the data
01:25 - types manually so this is also called
01:27 - manual type conversion so guys over here
01:29 - what you have to do is you have to type
01:32 - cast from one data type to another so we
01:34 - will check that with the help of
01:36 - examples as well so first of all we will
01:38 - check the implicit conversion so as you
01:40 - can see this is the example that is
01:41 - example one we have the integer number
01:44 - as 123 but the float number is 1.23 so
01:48 - this float number is having decimal but
01:50 - this integer number is not having
01:51 - decimal and then the new number which is
01:54 - going to add both the numbers that is
01:55 - integer number and the float number but
01:58 - guys this is the integer and this is the
02:00 - float so what should be the result let
02:02 - us check this with the help of our
02:03 - python code execution so I'll just copy
02:05 - these lines of code over here and then
02:07 - I'll paste this over here guys what I
02:10 - will do is I'll simply hide this section
02:11 - which is the Explorer section because we
02:14 - are going to write all the programs in
02:16 - the same file over here so when we save
02:18 - this file and then when we try running
02:20 - this code nothing will happen guys
02:22 - that's because what we have done is we
02:23 - have initialized the integer number we
02:26 - have initialized the float number as
02:27 - well and what we are doing is we are
02:29 - just adding both the numbers and we are
02:31 - assigning the result in the new number
02:34 - but we are not printing anything so we
02:36 - are supposed to print something over
02:37 - here what we will do is we will print
02:39 - and first of all what do we print let us
02:42 - say we want to find the type of this
02:44 - variable that is new number so we can
02:46 - simply provide type function and then
02:48 - inside this we will provide the new
02:50 - number over here that is the name of the
02:52 - variable and then what we will be doing
02:54 - is we will print the value of this new
02:56 - number so we will simply have another
02:58 - print statement and we will say new
03:01 - number over here so first of all we will
03:03 - get the type so that we will come to
03:05 - know what data type is being assigned to
03:07 - this new number that's because we are
03:08 - adding an integer number and the float
03:10 - number together so let me just save this
03:12 - file and try running this code now so as
03:15 - you can see class float so this proves
03:17 - that float is being stored over here in
03:20 - the new number that's because when we
03:22 - add an integer and the float number the
03:25 - highest data type that is the float
03:26 - number will be assigned to this result
03:28 - number that is the new number over here
03:30 - so that is what type of new number is
03:32 - being displayed as float and what will
03:34 - be the result of this addition 123 plus
03:37 - 1.23 it is giving us the result as
03:40 - 124.23 which is being displayed by using
03:43 - this line of code over here wherein we
03:45 - are printing this new number variable
03:47 - the value of this new number will be
03:49 - displayed now guys coming to next
03:51 - example as you can see example 2 we have
03:54 - the number string but this is of the
03:55 - string data type why so because we have
03:58 - provided this number in inside the
04:00 - single quotes over here as I have told
04:02 - you whenever we are providing the single
04:04 - quote or the double quote the value
04:06 - inside those codes are treated as the
04:09 - string and then we have another variable
04:11 - that is num integer and this is the
04:13 - simple number so this number is going to
04:15 - be treated as an integer but what
04:17 - happens when we add both these numbers
04:19 - over here that is new integer since this
04:21 - is the integer type so nothing will
04:23 - happen over here but num string so
04:25 - basically this is of the string data
04:27 - type and we cannot add a string to the
04:29 - integer we are using the plus operator
04:31 - in order to add the two numbers over
04:33 - here since num integer is a number over
04:36 - here so guys let us check what happens
04:37 - I'll just copy these lines of code and
04:40 - paste this over here and what we will do
04:42 - is we will simply print the value of
04:45 - this Num Sum so over here we have num
04:47 - underscore sum over here that is the
04:50 - result variable let me just save this
04:52 - file and try running this code now so as
04:54 - you can see it is giving us some error
04:55 - Num Sum It is equal to so this
04:57 - expression is being printed over here
04:59 - and we are getting the messages type
05:01 - error unsupported operand type for plus
05:05 - that is integer and strength so what it
05:07 - is saying is this plus operator it is
05:10 - having unsupported operands now what are
05:12 - the unsupported operands the first
05:14 - operand is integer which it is showing
05:16 - over here as end and the second one is
05:18 - Str which is string over here so guys
05:20 - what we are supposed to do is we are
05:22 - supposed to convert the string to the
05:24 - integer this num integer is already of
05:26 - the integer data type but this num
05:28 - string is not of the integer data type
05:30 - and that is why we are getting this
05:32 - error so guys how do we convert this num
05:34 - string to the integer data type we
05:36 - simply have to provide this variable
05:39 - that is num string inside the open and
05:41 - close parenthesis and before this
05:44 - parenthesis we simply have to provide
05:46 - the data type to which we need to
05:48 - convert this num string to that is the
05:50 - integer so we simply provide int that is
05:53 - the integer data type so as you can see
05:55 - this is the format we have first
05:57 - enclosed this variable that is num
05:59 - string inside the open and close
06:01 - parenthesis and then we have provide end
06:03 - before this open parenthesis over here
06:06 - and this is how this num string will be
06:08 - converted to the integer data type so
06:10 - the value will be 12 over here and this
06:12 - num integer is having the value is 23
06:15 - which is again the integer and the sum
06:16 - will be stored in this Num Sum so let me
06:19 - just save this file and try running this
06:20 - code now so as you can see 35 is being
06:23 - displayed over here because 23 plus 12
06:26 - is 35 and that is what we are getting
06:28 - over here so guys this is the manual
06:30 - type conversion so whenever we are
06:33 - coming from a data type that is having
06:34 - the high memory to a low memory such as
06:37 - the string to the integer we are
06:39 - supposed to do a manual type conversion
06:41 - and that is what we have done over here
06:43 - so Guys these were the two examples as
06:45 - far as automatic and manual type
06:47 - conversions are concerned which are also
06:49 - called implicit and explicit conversion
06:51 - wherever possible python will
06:53 - automatically convert the data types of
06:55 - the variables but wherever it is not
06:57 - possible it will give you the warning at
06:59 - least or or else it will give you the
07:01 - error while you are running your Python
07:02 - program so guys that's it in this video
07:04 - please make sure that you practice on
07:05 - your own so that on different inputs you
07:07 - get different output please make sure
