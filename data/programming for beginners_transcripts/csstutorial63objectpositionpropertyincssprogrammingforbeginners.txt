00:00 - so now we will see object position
00:02 - property in CSS so guys basically the
00:04 - CSS object position property is used to
00:08 - specify how an image or the video should
00:11 - be positioned within its container and
00:13 - this we are going to check with the help
00:15 - of examples as well now as previously we
00:17 - have seen that the object to fit CSS
00:20 - property has one of the values that is
00:22 - covered over here in which case the
00:24 - image will be displayed in such a way
00:26 - that only partial image will be
00:28 - displayed as far as the withd and height
00:30 - is concerned for that particular image
00:32 - container now guys along with this
00:34 - object fit equal to cover we can use the
00:37 - object position property in CSS in order
00:40 - to display the specific region of the
00:43 - image that we want to display and this
00:44 - we are going to check with the help of
00:46 - examples so let us move to the vs code
00:48 - over here so simply I'm going to remove
00:50 - the previous lines of code inside the
00:52 - style. CSS file and inside the HTML file
00:56 - we have the diff tag with the class
00:57 - container over here and inside this we
01:00 - have the sample image with the help of
01:02 - the IMG tag over here now guys what we
01:05 - will do is we will have certain styling
01:07 - for this particular container and the
01:09 - IMG tag as well so before that let us
01:12 - see how the page looks like over here so
01:14 - as you can see this is the original
01:15 - image that is getting displayed over
01:17 - here on the web page now guys let us
01:19 - provide the width and height for this
01:21 - image and for the container as well we
01:23 - are going to set certain CSS properties
01:26 - so first of all we will set the CSS
01:28 - properties for the container in which
01:29 - which case we will set the background
01:31 - color as yellow color over here and then
01:34 - apart from this we will have the display
01:36 - property as inline Block in this case
01:38 - and then we will also have the padding
01:40 - property and the value will be 20 pixels
01:43 - and then guys apart from this we will
01:45 - have the IMG tag for which we are going
01:47 - to set the CSS properties over here so
01:49 - let us say we have the width of 300
01:52 - pixels in this case and the height of
01:54 - 200 pixels so guys we have set the width
01:56 - and height of the image as well over
01:58 - here let me just save this file now and
02:00 - try reloading this page once again on
02:02 - the browser so as you can see this is
02:04 - the image that is getting displayed over
02:06 - here now guys let us reduce the width of
02:09 - this particular image to 100 pixels
02:11 - instead of 300 pixels over here so
02:14 - basically inside the style.css file we
02:16 - will reduce the width to 100 pixels in
02:19 - such a way that it is less than the
02:21 - height of the image let us see how the
02:23 - image looks like so let me just save
02:25 - this file now and try reloading this
02:27 - page once again on the browser so as you
02:29 - can see by default the object fit CSS
02:32 - property is f over here which is trying
02:35 - to fit the entire image within this
02:37 - particular width that is 100 pixels in
02:40 - this case so guys what we will do is
02:42 - instead of having the image fit in this
02:44 - particular width only the portion that
02:46 - is this particular part over here you
02:48 - can see that there's a bridge inside
02:50 - this image we will only display that
02:52 - bridge over here within the 100 pixels
02:55 - of the width so what we have to do is
02:57 - simply we will set the object f F CSS
03:00 - property to cover in this case so guys
03:02 - basically we will use this object fit
03:05 - and the value that we are going to set
03:06 - is cover over here let us see how the
03:08 - image will look like now so let me just
03:10 - save this file now and try reloading
03:13 - this page once again on the browser
03:14 - notice that the entire image is getting
03:16 - displayed right now over here since the
03:18 - default value is fi but we have set the
03:21 - value as cover now so when we reload
03:24 - this page as you can see only the bridge
03:26 - is getting displayed over here so guys
03:28 - in this way you can set the object fit
03:30 - CSS property as covered in order to
03:33 - display only the portion of that
03:35 - particular image now guys this is the
03:36 - middle portion of the image what if you
03:38 - want to see the right portion or the
03:40 - left portion of the image so in this
03:42 - case we are going to use the object
03:45 - position property in which case the
03:47 - specific portion of the image can be
03:49 - displayed so guys let us check that as
03:51 - well so inside the style. CSS file after
03:54 - the object fit we will have the object
03:56 - position CSS property and simply we are
03:59 - going to set the percentages over here
04:01 - so we are going to set 80% and after
04:04 - this space character we are going to set
04:06 - the 100% in this case so basically this
04:08 - will help us in order to see the right
04:11 - portion that is the right part of the
04:13 - image so let me just save this file now
04:15 - and try reloading this page once again
04:17 - on the browser so as you can see this is
04:19 - the right hand side of the image this is
04:21 - the right part of the bridge that we
04:23 - were able to see just now and then when
04:25 - we reduce the number from 80% to let's
04:27 - say 70% we will be a able to see the
04:30 - left hand side of this image to some
04:32 - extent so when we change it to 70% over
04:35 - here let me just save this file now and
04:37 - try reloading this page once again on
04:39 - the browser it has come slightly to the
04:41 - left over here guys similarly we can see
04:44 - the extreme left of the image as well so
04:46 - let us say we set the 70% to 15% in this
04:50 - case so this will help us in order to
04:52 - see the left side of the image so when
04:54 - we save this file now and try reloading
04:57 - this page once again on the browser so
04:59 - as you can see this this is the left
05:00 - hand side of the image that is getting
05:01 - displayed right now so guys in this way
05:04 - you can easily set the object position
05:06 - CSS property in order to set the exact
05:10 - portion or the exact part of the image
05:12 - that you want to display on the screen
05:14 - based on your project requirements so
