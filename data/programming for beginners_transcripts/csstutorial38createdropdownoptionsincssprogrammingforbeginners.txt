00:00 - so now we will see how we can create the
00:02 - drop- down options in CSS so guys
00:05 - basically we are going to create a
00:07 - hoverable drop down with the help of the
00:10 - CSS and the drop down options should be
00:13 - displayed when the mouse is hovered over
00:15 - a button so guys let us check this with
00:17 - the help of examples in vs code over
00:19 - here so simply I'm going to remove the
00:21 - previous lines of code that we had
00:23 - written in the HTML and the CSS files
00:26 - over here now guys as far as the drop
00:29 - down option is concerned simply you can
00:31 - have the select tag over here and inside
00:34 - the select tag you can have multiple
00:36 - options in this case so let's say we
00:38 - have one of the option as option one
00:41 - over here so simply we are going to say
00:43 - one in this case and then you can copy
00:45 - paste this line of code and then we can
00:48 - change the text to the other options
00:51 - over here so we have the two so we have
00:54 - the second option is two and the third
00:56 - option is three over here so guys
00:58 - basically you can simply have the drop
00:59 - drop down options with the help of the
01:01 - HTML tag that is the select and the
01:04 - option tags over here let me just save
01:06 - this file now and try reloading this
01:08 - page on the browser so as you can see we
01:11 - have these drop- down options over here
01:13 - but guys we are going to implement the
01:15 - drop down options by using the CSS in
01:18 - this case instead of using the select
01:20 - and the option tags over here so what we
01:23 - are going to do is we are going to
01:25 - Define certain diff tags over here and a
01:28 - button tag as well and using the CSS
01:30 - file over here and certain CSS
01:33 - properties we are going to display these
01:35 - options when we get the mouse cursor on
01:37 - that particular button that we are going
01:39 - to Define so guys let us complete this
01:41 - exercise over here so simply we are
01:44 - going to have let's say the h2 tag over
01:46 - here and then we will say get your mouse
01:50 - cursor on below button so guys simply we
01:53 - are having this particular statement
01:55 - that is get your mouse cursor on below
01:57 - button over here and we are going to
01:59 - Define the diff tag in this casee which
02:02 - is going to have the class name as drop
02:04 - down over here so simply we are going to
02:06 - define the diff tag followed by the dot
02:08 - character and then we have the name of
02:10 - the class that is dropped down and when
02:12 - we press enter as you can see a diff tag
02:14 - with the class name that is drop down is
02:17 - getting created over here now guys
02:19 - inside this we are going to have the
02:21 - button tag over here and for this button
02:23 - tag we are going to say drop down as the
02:26 - text and then guys over here we are
02:28 - going to have the class and the class
02:30 - name will be button drop down in this
02:33 - case guys we are going to make use of
02:35 - these class names inside the CSS files
02:38 - and that is why we are defining these
02:39 - classes over here and it is one of the
02:41 - best practices in order to create the
02:44 - classes or the IDS for the different
02:46 - HTML elements that you create based on
02:49 - your requirements now guys apart from
02:51 - this after this button we are going to
02:53 - have another diff tag over here and then
02:56 - we are going to have the class name in
02:58 - this case as the drop down cont content
03:00 - so guys basically this is the diff tag
03:02 - which is going to display the drop-down
03:05 - content that is all the options as you
03:07 - can see these are the options that will
03:09 - be present inside this particular diff
03:11 - tag over here so guys inside this what
03:14 - we will do is we will have the anchor
03:16 - tags in this case so we are going to
03:18 - have the HF attribute as the hash
03:21 - character and simply we are going to
03:23 - provide link one over here and then we
03:25 - are going to copy paste these lines of
03:27 - code and simply we are going to say link
03:29 - 2 and Link three so guys basically what
03:32 - we are doing is we are having three
03:34 - options over here inside the diff that
03:37 - is defining the drop- down content in
03:39 - this case so guys let me just save this
03:41 - file now and try reloading this page
03:43 - once again on the browser so as you can
03:45 - see we have the h2 tag over here which
03:47 - is having the simple statement get your
03:49 - mouse cursor on below button so guys
03:52 - when we get the mouse cursor on this
03:54 - particular button over here all these
03:56 - link items that are the options should
03:58 - get displayed in this case so guys let
04:00 - us provide certain CSS properties to
04:03 - this button element first of all so what
04:05 - we are going to do is we will copy the
04:07 - class of this button over here and
04:10 - simply inside the style. CSS file we are
04:12 - going to use the dot character followed
04:14 - by the name of the class in this case so
04:17 - guys basically we are going to have
04:19 - certain background color so let's say we
04:21 - have the background color over here and
04:24 - the text color as white so guys
04:26 - basically we have the color CSS property
04:28 - as white over here and also we will have
04:31 - the padding of let's say 10 pixels in
04:33 - this case let me just save this file now
04:35 - and try reloading this page once again
04:37 - on the browser so as you can see we have
04:39 - this particular button with the
04:41 - background color that is green and the
04:43 - text color is white and we have certain
04:45 - padding that we have implemented over
04:47 - here guys there is a default border that
04:49 - is getting displayed over here so what
04:51 - we are going to do is simply inside this
04:53 - button we are going to say border it is
04:56 - equal to none so that we can remove this
04:58 - border from this button let me just save
05:00 - this file now and try reloading this
05:02 - page once again on the browser so as you
05:04 - can see we don't have any border right
05:06 - now over here now guys what we are going
05:07 - to do is these link items are present in
05:10 - one line we want them to be on the
05:12 - separate lines over here and also we
05:15 - want the div section that is the drop-
05:17 - down content it should have certain
05:19 - background color so guys what we are
05:21 - going to do is first of all we are going
05:23 - to style this drop- down content diff
05:25 - tag over here so simply I'm going to
05:27 - copy this class name and then inside the
05:30 - CSS file we are going to provide the dot
05:32 - character followed by the class name
05:34 - over here and then we are going to
05:36 - provide the background color in this
05:38 - case so let's say we provide the gray
05:40 - color as the background color over here
05:42 - so guys we have the 6 * D characters in
05:45 - this case which is representing a gray
05:48 - color shade over here and then apart
05:50 - from this we also want the width of this
05:52 - particular section to be limited so we
05:55 - are going to provide the width is 100
05:57 - pixels in this case let me just save
05:59 - this file now and try reloading this
06:00 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:02 - can see we have the background color as
06:04 - the gray color over here but guys apart
06:06 - from this we also want these links to be
06:08 - present on the next line so what we can
06:11 - do is simply inside this class name so
06:13 - we are going to provide dot followed by
06:15 - the class name and whatever a tags are
06:17 - present we are going to provide the
06:19 - anchor tag over here and then inside
06:22 - this we are going to say display is
06:24 - equal to block so guys by default the
06:27 - display properties is in line for this
06:29 - particular anchor tag and that is why
06:31 - all the links are getting displayed on
06:33 - the same line so we are going to provide
06:36 - displays equal to block so that all of
06:38 - them are displayed on separate lines
06:40 - over here so let me just save this file
06:42 - now and try reloading this page once
06:44 - again on the browser so as you can see
06:46 - all the links are now getting displayed
06:48 - on the separate lines apart from this
06:50 - let us remove the underline as well from
06:52 - these anchor tags so we will provide the
06:55 - text decoration is equal to none in this
06:58 - case and also apart from this let us
07:00 - provide the color of this text as black
07:03 - color over here so we are going to
07:04 - provide the color as black and also
07:07 - provide the padding so guys over here
07:09 - simply we are going to provide the
07:10 - padding as 5 pixels let me just save
07:13 - this file now and try reloading this
07:15 - page so as you can see we have the
07:17 - padding also we have removed the
07:18 - underline over here and we have the text
07:21 - color as black color right now now guys
07:23 - apart from this when the user gets the
07:25 - cursor on these particular links we want
07:27 - the background color to be updated for
07:29 - these links so what we can do is simply
07:32 - on the hover property of these a tag we
07:34 - can change the background color so
07:36 - simply I'm going to copy these lines of
07:38 - code and paste it over here but we are
07:41 - going to provide the sudo class in this
07:43 - case which is the over sudo class and on
07:45 - this hover Udo class we want to change
07:48 - the background color so simply we are
07:49 - going to say background color in this
07:51 - case and let's say we have the
07:53 - background color as Aqua so guys
07:55 - basically we are going to set this
07:56 - particular background color when the
07:58 - user gets the the mouse on that
08:00 - particular link text so let me just save
08:02 - this file now and try reloading this
08:04 - page once again on the browser so now
08:06 - when we get the cursor over here on
08:08 - these links that is the options the
08:10 - background color of that particular
08:12 - option is now getting updated now now
08:15 - guys very important thing is when we get
08:17 - the mouse cursor on this drop- down then
08:19 - only we want this particular section to
08:22 - be displayed that is having the list of
08:24 - options so by default all these list of
08:27 - options should be hidden over here so
08:29 - what we can do is simply for this
08:31 - particular drop- down content class we
08:34 - are going to define the display is equal
08:36 - to nonone property so over here we
08:38 - already have this drop- down content
08:40 - inside our CSS file so simply we are
08:43 - going to say display is equal to none
08:45 - this time so guys basically by default
08:48 - this particular diff tag that is having
08:50 - the class that is drop down content will
08:52 - not be displayed over here so let me
08:54 - just save this file now and try
08:55 - reloading this page once again on the
08:57 - browser so as you can see after finding
08:59 - all the CSS properties we have set the
09:02 - display is equal to none property so by
09:04 - default this particular section which is
09:06 - present over here right now but it is
09:08 - not getting visible and we want it to be
09:11 - visible when we get the mouse cursor on
09:13 - this drop down button over here so guys
09:15 - how do we make it visible so basically
09:17 - we are going to set the display is equal
09:19 - to block property when we get the mouse
09:22 - cursor on this particular diff tag over
09:24 - here so what is the diff tag in this
09:26 - case so it is the diff tag that is
09:28 - having the class equal to drop down so
09:30 - simply I'm going to copy this class that
09:32 - is dropped down over here and then
09:33 - inside the style. CSS file simply we are
09:36 - going to say dot followed by the name of
09:38 - the class that is dropped down and when
09:40 - we get the mouse cursor on this
09:43 - particular diff tag we are going to
09:45 - provide the hover codo class over here
09:48 - so basically it says that whenever we
09:50 - are going to get the mouse cursor on the
09:53 - diff tag that is having the class drop
09:55 - down over here then these particular CSS
09:57 - properties will be implement Ed so what
10:00 - we want to do is we want to make the
10:02 - drop- down content as visible so guys
10:05 - when we hover over this particular diff
10:07 - tag we want the drop- down content that
10:10 - is this particular diff to be visible
10:12 - over here so we need to copy this class
10:14 - name that is drop down content over here
10:17 - and after this H we need to provide the
10:19 - space character and the div that is with
10:22 - this particular class name should be
10:24 - displayed so we need to provide the dot
10:26 - character since it is a class name and
10:28 - then inside this we we are going to say
10:30 - display it is equal to block this time
10:32 - so guys by default it was display is
10:34 - equal to none but when we get the mouse
10:37 - cursor on this particular diff tag that
10:39 - is having the class drop down so on the
10:41 - hover sudo class we want to get the
10:44 - drop- down content to be displayed over
10:46 - here with the help of the display equal
10:48 - to blog so let me just save this file
10:50 - now and try reloading this page once
10:52 - again on the browser so by default there
10:54 - is no drop down that you can see over
10:56 - here but the moment we get the mouse
10:58 - cursor on this drop drop down button
11:00 - over here you can see that the drop-
11:02 - down content is now getting displayed
11:04 - over here now guys if you notice when we
11:06 - get the mouse cursor over here as well
11:08 - on the right hand side the drop- down
11:10 - content is again getting displayed why
11:12 - so that's because we have provided the
11:15 - display equal to block on the drop- down
11:17 - class which is the diff tag over here
11:19 - and as you know the diff tag is the
11:21 - Block Level element so let us right
11:23 - click over here and click on the inspect
11:25 - option let us see the length of the diff
11:28 - tag over here so as you can see this is
11:30 - the diff tag with the class drop down on
11:32 - which we have provided the hover
11:34 - property and and if you see the entire
11:36 - width of the screen is getting
11:38 - highlighted over here so guys what we
11:40 - can do is simply for this particular
11:42 - diff tag that is having the class drop
11:44 - down we can have the display property as
11:47 - in line so simply we are going to go
11:49 - inside the style. CSS file over here and
11:52 - for this class that is the drop down
11:54 - over here we are going to provide the
11:56 - dot character followed by the class name
11:58 - that is drop down and simply we are
12:00 - going to say display is equal to in line
12:03 - so basically it is going to take only
12:05 - that much width as required by the text
12:08 - inside this particular diff tag over
12:10 - here let me just save this file now and
12:12 - try reloading this page once again on
12:14 - the browser so now if you see the drop
12:16 - down diff tag it is not taking the
12:18 - entire width of the screen but it is
12:21 - only taking the width of the button that
12:23 - is present over here right now so guys
12:25 - when we get the mouse cursor over here
12:27 - as you can see we are getting the drop
12:29 - down content that is getting visible
12:31 - right now but when we get the mouse
12:33 - cursor on the right hand side now there
12:35 - is no drop- down content that is getting
12:37 - displayed so guys only when you get the
12:39 - mouse cursor on this particular button
12:42 - then only the drop- down content that is
12:44 - having the list of options to be
12:46 - selected will be displayed over here so
12:49 - guys this is the way that you can
12:50 - implement the drop down options by using
12:52 - CSS properties comment in the comment
