00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to copy the file content
00:06 - from one file to another file so guys
00:08 - this Python program will help you to
00:11 - copy the content of one file to another
00:13 - file that is from source to destination
00:15 - we will use the sh util module so guys
00:18 - this is one of the important modules in
00:20 - the Python program which is having copy
00:23 - file function which can help us in order
00:25 - to copy the content from one file to
00:27 - another file so let us check this with
00:29 - the help of example now over here so
00:31 - what we are going to do is we are going
00:33 - to import the sh util module so we use
00:36 - the from keyword and then we have sh
00:39 - util in this case so guys inside this
00:42 - module we are going to have the copy
00:44 - file function so we use the import
00:46 - function and then we say copy file so
00:49 - guys this is one of the ways in order to
00:52 - import the function from a particular
00:54 - module if we don't want to import the
00:56 - entire module but only want to import a
00:59 - particular a function from a module we
01:01 - can use this statement by using the from
01:03 - keyword and Then followed by the module
01:06 - name and then we use the import keyword
01:08 - and then the function that we want to
01:10 - import and then guys what we can do is
01:12 - simply we can use this copy file
01:14 - function in order to copy the content
01:16 - from one file to another file so over
01:19 - here it takes two parameters the first
01:21 - parameter will be the source file and
01:23 - then the second parameter will be the
01:25 - destination file so guys I have two
01:27 - files over here that is the output file
01:29 - which is going to be the source file
01:31 - over here right now so when I open this
01:33 - file as you can see it is having certain
01:35 - statements that is this is first line
01:38 - and then we have this a second line and
01:40 - then we have this is another statement
01:42 - over here so this is some test content
01:44 - that I have written in the output file
01:46 - what we are going to do is all these
01:49 - statements we are going to copy from the
01:51 - output file and paste it inside the test
01:53 - file over here as you can see so if I
01:56 - open this test file it is not having any
01:58 - content right now so we we are going to
02:00 - copy the content from the output file to
02:03 - the test file by using the copy file
02:05 - function over here so let us move to the
02:08 - vs code right now so the very first
02:10 - thing is it is expecting the source file
02:12 - so inside the double quotes we provide
02:14 - the entire path of this directory over
02:17 - here so I'll simply copy this and paste
02:20 - this and then guys in order to escape
02:21 - this backslash we have to provide
02:23 - another backslash over here so I'll
02:26 - quickly provide the extra backslash in
02:28 - front of the single backslashes and then
02:31 - guys we again provide the double
02:32 - backslash and then the name of the file
02:34 - so which is the output.txt so I'll
02:37 - simply copy this and paste this over
02:39 - here this is the output followed by Dot
02:41 - and then we have txt now guys the second
02:44 - parameter will be the destination file
02:46 - so over here I provide comma and then I
02:49 - come to the next line so that it becomes
02:51 - more readable and then again since the
02:53 - destination file that is the test file
02:55 - is present in the same directory I am
02:58 - going to provide the same directory over
02:59 - here once again so I'll copy this and
03:02 - paste this over here and then again I'll
03:04 - escape this backslash character once
03:07 - again on all the instances now guys in
03:09 - the end we have to provide the
03:10 - destination file over here which is test
03:12 - file right now so we have test dot txt
03:15 - in this case so we have test.txt so guys
03:19 - basically the first parameter is the
03:20 - output.txt file the entire path of this
03:24 - file and then we have the test.txt so
03:27 - both these parameters are provided in
03:29 - the copy file right now so guys what we
03:31 - will do is after this we can simply have
03:33 - the print statement over here and then
03:35 - we can simply say file content copy
03:40 - successfully so get we get certain
03:42 - message about the success of this
03:44 - operation in order to copy the content
03:47 - of one file into another file so guys
03:49 - let me just save this file now and try
03:51 - running this code so as you can see we
03:53 - are getting file content copied
03:54 - successfully now we have to go inside
03:57 - that directory and open this file that
03:59 - is a test file which is the destination
04:01 - file so when I open this as you can see
04:03 - we are getting the content of that file
04:05 - which was present inside the output so
04:08 - let me open that output file as well so
04:10 - these were the statements and then the
04:12 - same statements we are getting in the
04:14 - test file as well so as you can see we
04:16 - are getting this is first line and then
04:17 - we have this is second line and then we
04:19 - have this is another statement so guys
04:21 - in this way we can easily copy the
04:23 - content of one file to another file by
04:25 - using the copy file function inside the
04:28 - sh util module now guys what happens if
04:30 - we copy the content of another file to
04:33 - the same test file over here currently
04:35 - it is having certain content so whether
04:37 - it will append the new statements from
04:39 - the new source file or whether it will
04:41 - overwrite the entire content let us
04:43 - check this so basically as you can see
04:45 - we have another file that is the names
04:47 - file it is having the list of certain
04:49 - names over here so what we are going to
04:51 - do is we are going to use this file as
04:53 - the source file now so I'll simply open
04:56 - the vs code over here instead of
04:58 - output.txt we will send provide
05:00 - names.txt so that our source file right
05:03 - now is different that is the names file
05:05 - the destination file is same that is a
05:07 - test file so let me just save this file
05:09 - now and try running this code once again
05:11 - so as you can see file content copied
05:13 - successfully if I come over here in the
05:15 - directory and open this test file once
05:18 - again as you can see we are getting the
05:19 - names now and the previous content of
05:22 - the output file has been overwritten now
05:24 - so guys this is important functionality
05:26 - whenever you are using the copy file
05:28 - function the entire content will be
05:31 - overwritten in the destination file if
05:33 - it is having any content and let's say
05:35 - if this file is not present let's say I
05:37 - delete this file so what will happen
05:39 - whether the Python program will help us
05:41 - in order to create that file and copy
05:43 - the content from that file let us check
05:45 - that so I'll just run this code once
05:47 - again over here when this file is not
05:49 - present right now that is the test.txt
05:51 - is not present in the directory that we
05:54 - have mentioned so when I run this code
05:56 - as you can see it says file content
05:58 - copied successfully when I come over
06:00 - again in the directory so test file is
06:03 - being created right now so if there is
06:05 - no file that is created a new file will
06:07 - be created and inside that we will get
06:09 - the content of the source file so guys
06:11 - this is the functionality of the copy
06:13 - file function inside the sh util so
06:16 - please make sure that you practice on
06:18 - your own so that on different inputs you
06:19 - get different outputs make sure that you
06:21 - like this video so that it reaches to
06:23 - more people and subscribe to this
06:25 - channel so that you get the
06:26 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
06:28 - the next video that we are going to talk
06:30 - about is Python program to concatenate
06:33 - to list so stay tuned
