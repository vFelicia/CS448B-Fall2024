00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find LCM using gcd so
00:07 - guys previously we have seen a program
00:08 - in order to find the LCM which was using
00:11 - the while loop which is lower to run so
00:14 - if I show you the program as you can see
00:16 - we were having the two numbers that is
00:18 - 12 and 14 and over here in the compute
00:21 - LCM function what we were doing is we
00:24 - were finding the greatest number out of
00:26 - these two numbers that is X and Y so
00:28 - once we find the greater number we
00:30 - divide that number by both the numbers
00:32 - that is X and Y in such a way that the
00:34 - remainders must be 0 and if it is not 0
00:36 - we need to increment the value of
00:39 - Greater number by one so guys over here
00:41 - the greater number was 14 so both the
00:43 - numbers that is 12 and 14 were divided
00:46 - by this greater number so the remainders
00:48 - were not 0 since 14 divided by 12 will
00:51 - not give us the remainder as 0 so next
00:53 - time the greater number will be
00:54 - incremented by 1 and this time it will
00:56 - be 15 so we have to increment the number
00:59 - one at a time which will be little bit
01:01 - time consuming as far as finding the LCM
01:03 - is concerned so basically finally if we
01:06 - see the LCM of these two numbers that is
01:08 - 12 and 14 is 84. so approximately 70
01:11 - times the control Flow came into this
01:13 - while loop and again and again the
01:15 - greater number was incremented by 1 so
01:18 - this is little bit time consuming so do
01:20 - we have the efficient way in order to
01:22 - find the LCM yes we can make it more
01:25 - efficient by using the fact that the
01:27 - product of two numbers is equal to the
01:30 - product of the least common multiple and
01:32 - the gcd that is greatest common divisor
01:34 - of these two numbers so basically what
01:37 - we are saying is the number one
01:38 - multiplied by number 2 it will be equal
01:41 - to LCM multiplied by gcd in this case so
01:44 - when we take this gcd on the other side
01:46 - so we will get LCM that is on the left
01:49 - hand side over here it will be equal to
01:51 - number one multiplied by number 2
01:53 - divided by gcd in this case so guys we
01:56 - can easily find the LCM of two numbers
01:58 - by finding the result of of this
02:00 - expression for which we need to find the
02:02 - gcd as well which we have already found
02:04 - using the euclidean algorithm previously
02:07 - so guys let us implement this method in
02:09 - order to find the LCM of the two given
02:11 - numbers so I'll just remove these lines
02:13 - of code over here and we will have this
02:15 - compute LCM method over here now guys we
02:18 - need to Define another method that is
02:20 - compute hcf so over here we have the def
02:23 - keyword followed by compute hcf and this
02:27 - will again take the two variables that
02:29 - is X comma y over here and then what we
02:31 - have to do is we have to Loop through
02:33 - the value of y until the value of y is 0
02:36 - so over here we say While y in this case
02:39 - so the control flow will always go
02:41 - inside this while loop until the Y value
02:43 - is not equal to 0 once it is equal to 0
02:46 - it will come out of this while loop and
02:48 - then we have to have this expression
02:50 - that is X comma y it is equal to we have
02:53 - to assign the value of y to X first over
02:56 - here so y value will be assigned to X
02:59 - over here followed by by comma and then
03:01 - this variable that is y will get the
03:03 - value of x percent Y which is the
03:06 - remainder by dividing both the numbers
03:07 - that is X and Y so guys over here we
03:10 - have the expression that is X percent Y
03:12 - in this case so basically we are getting
03:14 - the remainder of dividing the two
03:16 - numbers that is X and Y and assigning
03:18 - this value to the variable Y and we are
03:21 - assigning the value of y to X and
03:23 - finally when the Y value is 0 we will
03:25 - find our hcf in this variable that is X
03:28 - and this is how the euclidean algorithm
03:31 - Works which we have already seen in one
03:33 - of the previous program guys you can
03:34 - find the link to that program in the
03:36 - description section as well now guys
03:38 - what we have to do is after coming out
03:40 - of this while loop we have to return the
03:42 - value of x which is the hcf of these two
03:45 - numbers now guys once we find this hcf
03:48 - we need to implement this expression
03:50 - that is number one multiplied by number
03:52 - 2 and then divided by gcd so over here
03:55 - what we will simply do is we will have
03:56 - the expression that is X multiplied by Y
03:59 - and then we have the division operator
04:01 - guys we have the two forward slashes so
04:03 - that we divide the two integers over
04:05 - here and then what we have to do is we
04:08 - need to call the compute hcf which will
04:10 - give us the gcd that is the greatest
04:12 - common divisor of these two numbers we
04:14 - have to pass the two numbers as X and Y
04:17 - so guys this particular expression will
04:19 - give us the LCM and what we can do is
04:21 - simply we can return this expression so
04:24 - basically this expression will give us
04:26 - the LCM and that is what we are
04:27 - returning to this method that is compute
04:30 - LCM over here so guys the LCM of 12 and
04:33 - 14 it is expected to be 84 so let us
04:36 - verify that I'll just save this file now
04:38 - and try running this code so as we can
04:40 - see LCM of two numbers 12 and 14 it is
04:43 - equal to 84. now guys how did we find
04:45 - this value as 84 over here let us check
04:48 - it so basically the number one and
04:50 - number two that is X and Y over 12 and
04:52 - 14 so we'll just provide X and Y value
04:55 - as 12 and 14 over here so guys what
04:58 - happened is this 14 value of y was
05:01 - assigned to this x value while Computing
05:04 - the hcf so now X it became 14 and then
05:07 - the value of y it was equal to X percent
05:11 - Y which means 12 percent 14 which is
05:14 - equal to 12 in this case since quotient
05:17 - will be 0 and remainder will be 12 in
05:19 - this case so we have y it is equal to 12
05:21 - so next time what happened is the value
05:23 - of x it will be equal to this 12 because
05:26 - the value of y will be assigned to the
05:28 - variable of X so we have 12 over here
05:31 - and then y it will be equal to 14
05:33 - percent 12 in which case the value of y
05:36 - will be 2 now because 14 divided by 12
05:39 - the COS will be 1 and remainder will be
05:41 - 2 so over here y will be equal to 2 in
05:44 - this case now guys this value of 2 will
05:46 - be assigned to X next time so basically
05:49 - X it is equal to 2 and then y it is
05:52 - equal to X percent Y which is 12 percent
05:54 - 2 in which case the Y value will become
05:57 - 0 over here so basically the hcf value
06:00 - will be 2 now so in this expression that
06:02 - is in order to find the LCM we have
06:04 - found the gcds2 so number one multiplied
06:07 - by number 2 let us use the calculator
06:09 - over here we take number 1 is 2L
06:12 - multiplied by number 2 which is equal to
06:14 - 14 and then we get it as 168 and then we
06:17 - divide this number by gcd which is 2
06:19 - right now so when we divide this number
06:21 - by 2 as we can see we get 84 SC result
06:25 - and that is what we have found as the
06:27 - LCM of these two numbers that is LCM of
06:29 - 2 numbers 2s and 14 is 84. now guys
06:32 - let's say the number one and number 2 is
06:34 - 100 and 200 over here so we say 100 and
06:37 - 200 so what will be the LCM so it will
06:40 - be 200 this time because 100 multiplied
06:42 - by 2 is 200 and 200 multiplied by 1 is
06:45 - 200 again so let me just save this file
06:47 - now and try running this code so as we
06:50 - can see LCM of two numbers 100 and 200
06:52 - is 200 over here so guys please make
