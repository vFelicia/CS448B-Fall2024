00:00 - so now we will see table padding and
00:02 - spacing in HTML so guys HTML tables can
00:05 - adjust the padding inside the cells and
00:08 - also the space between the cells so we
00:11 - are going to check what is the
00:12 - difference between padding and spacing
00:14 - in HTML tables with the help of examples
00:17 - as well so basically a cell padding is
00:19 - the space between the cell edges and the
00:22 - cell content which means the data that
00:25 - we have defined and the border that is
00:28 - present for that particular table cell
00:30 - the space in between these two elements
00:32 - is called cell padding and by default
00:34 - the padding is set to zero so we can use
00:37 - the padding CSS property in this case so
00:39 - guys let us move to the vs code over
00:41 - here we already have a table which is
00:43 - being defined in this case which is
00:45 - having three rows over here the first
00:47 - row is having all the headers that is
00:49 - the first name last name and the age of
00:52 - the players that we want to Define and
00:54 - then the second row is having the player
00:56 - details in this case so as you can see
00:58 - we have the first name and the last name
01:01 - is Cristiano Ronaldo and his age is 38
01:04 - years and the second player that is
01:06 - Leonel Messi and his age is defined as
01:08 - 36 years so these are the two records
01:11 - that we have displayed in the form of
01:13 - the HTML table so if I show you this is
01:16 - the table that is being defined over
01:18 - here now guys let us provide certain
01:19 - borders over here in order to understand
01:22 - what is the difference between padding
01:24 - and spacing and how we can apply them in
01:27 - the HTML table so guys over here what we
01:29 - have to do is inside the style tag we
01:32 - will use the tags that is table and we
01:35 - will also have the header and we will
01:38 - also say table data all these tags must
01:41 - have the border of one pixel in this
01:44 - case so we will say border which is
01:46 - having the width as 1 pixel and the
01:49 - Border type is solid in this case and we
01:52 - will say the Border color is black color
01:54 - in this case so guys this is the
01:56 - shorthand method in order to define the
01:58 - border of the table in HTML now guys let
02:01 - me just save this file now and try
02:03 - reloading this page on the browser so as
02:06 - you can see a 1 pixel border is applied
02:09 - to all the elements that is the entire
02:11 - table element over here and then in
02:13 - between you can see that the table
02:15 - header and the TD that is the table data
02:18 - which is having the player details are
02:20 - also having the borders over here we can
02:23 - have the Border collapse property for
02:25 - the entire table as well so that the
02:27 - border is displayed only once instead of
02:29 - these double lines in this case so guys
02:32 - over here we will have the table tag and
02:35 - they should have the Border collapse
02:37 - property in this case and the value
02:39 - should be collapse in this case so guys
02:41 - let me just save this file now and try
02:43 - reloading this page on the browser what
02:45 - is the importance of this border
02:47 - collapse property so guys over here you
02:49 - can see multiple lines in this case that
02:51 - is for each individual cell over here
02:54 - but when we reload this page once again
02:56 - you can see only one single border for
02:58 - all the sales and that is is the
03:00 - importance of this border collapse that
03:02 - is being applied to the entire table
03:04 - over here now guys if you notice there
03:06 - is not much space in between the content
03:09 - that is let's say if we consider this
03:10 - Ronaldo as the last name over here we
03:13 - cannot see much space in between this
03:15 - particular content and the border that
03:17 - is surrounding this last name over here
03:19 - so what we can do is we can provide the
03:22 - padding property and provide certain
03:24 - space so that it looks good inside the
03:27 - table cell so guys over here where we
03:29 - have applied the Border we can simply
03:31 - come over here and provide the padding
03:34 - property and the padding that we want to
03:36 - provide is let's say we want to provide
03:38 - 10 pixels as the padding from all the
03:41 - sides so guys basically you can also
03:43 - Define padding at each individual sides
03:45 - that is left top bottom and right but
03:48 - you can also use the padding property in
03:51 - order to apply the same value from all
03:53 - the four sides so guys let me just save
03:55 - this file now and try reloading this
03:58 - page on the browser so as as you can see
04:00 - now we have some space in between the
04:02 - content and the borders that is
04:04 - surrounding the content over here so all
04:06 - the cells in this table is having 10
04:09 - pixels of padding in this case so guys
04:12 - this is the meaning of the padding
04:13 - property over here that we have just
04:15 - seen now guys what is the meaning of
04:17 - cell spacing so basically cell spacing
04:20 - is the space between each cell by
04:23 - default the space is set to two pixels
04:25 - use border spacing CSS property in order
04:28 - to define the cell spacing so guys we
04:31 - have already seen that by default the
04:33 - two pixels of spacing is present between
04:35 - all the cells so to understand it more
04:37 - clearly we have to remove the Border
04:40 - collapse property from the table so that
04:42 - multiple borders are being displayed
04:44 - once again so I'll just remove these
04:46 - lines of code over here let me just save
04:48 - this file now and try reloading this
04:50 - page so as you can see we have got the
04:53 - multiple borders once again for each and
04:55 - every cell over here now guys you can
04:57 - see that there is certain spacing in
04:59 - between between the border that is
05:01 - covering the table data over here so
05:03 - this space is 2 pixels by default so we
05:06 - can increase or decrease it so we can
05:08 - remove it by using the Border collapse
05:10 - property or we can increase it by using
05:13 - the Border spacing property so guys let
05:15 - us use that as well so over here what we
05:17 - have to do is again we have to come over
05:20 - here and then we will say border spacing
05:23 - in this case and then let's say we want
05:25 - to provide 10 pixels of the Border
05:27 - spacing in this case so let me just say
05:29 - this file now and try reloading this
05:31 - page on the browser so as you can see
05:34 - all the sales now are having the 10
05:36 - pixels of Border spacing in between them
05:39 - so guys this is the space in between the
05:41 - borders that is covering the table data
05:43 - content over here inside the HTML table
05:47 - and that is the meaning of this
05:48 - particular cell spacing over here so
05:50 - guys both these CSS properties that is
05:52 - padding and spacing are important as far
05:55 - as HTML tables are concerned So based on
05:58 - your requirements you can design your
06:00 - own tables and whatever padding and
06:02 - spacing is required you can Implement
06:04 - them by using these CSS properties so
