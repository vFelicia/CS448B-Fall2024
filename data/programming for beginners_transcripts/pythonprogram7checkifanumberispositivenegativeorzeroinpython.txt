00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to check if a number is
00:06 - positive negative or zero so guys in
00:08 - this example you will learn to check
00:10 - whether a number entered by the user is
00:13 - it a positive or A negative number or
00:15 - else if it is a zero so this problem is
00:17 - solved using the if alif and L statement
00:20 - so guys let us move to the vs code in
00:22 - order to check this program so basically
00:24 - the very first thing that we have to do
00:26 - is take the input from the user so this
00:29 - will be an integer so what we will do is
00:31 - we will take the integer function over
00:33 - here and inside this we will take the
00:35 - input from the user since the default
00:37 - input that will be taken by the user
00:39 - will be in the form of the string data
00:41 - type we need to convert it into the
00:43 - integer so that is why we have provided
00:45 - the inter prefix over here as the
00:47 - function so guys over here we will ask
00:50 - the user to enter the number so user
00:53 - will enter this number and it will be
00:55 - assigned to this number as an integer
00:57 - now we need to check whether this number
00:59 - that is entered by the user if it is a
01:01 - positive number if it is a negative
01:03 - number or else if it is 0 and
01:05 - accordingly we will print the output so
01:08 - the very first thing that we have to do
01:09 - is we use the if condition and we say
01:12 - number is it greater than zero so when a
01:15 - number is positive then it will be
01:17 - greater than 0 in this case what we have
01:19 - to do is simply we print that entered
01:22 - number so we say entered number that is
01:26 - we use the curly braces because we are
01:28 - going to use the dot format function
01:30 - over here in order to print the number
01:32 - over here and then we say is a positive
01:37 - number and then what we will do is after
01:40 - the string we will use dot followed by
01:42 - format and then we will provide this
01:45 - variable that is number so that it is
01:47 - printed inside this early braces over
01:49 - here so we say number over here now guys
01:52 - what if the number is not greater than 0
01:54 - so we will come in the alif part and
01:57 - then again we will check whether number
01:58 - is less than 0 so we say number is less
02:02 - than 0 and if the number is less than 0
02:04 - then it is a negative number so I'll
02:07 - simply copy this line of code and paste
02:09 - this over here but this time we will say
02:11 - enter number and then these curly braces
02:13 - will be replaced by this number is a
02:15 - negative number this time so we will say
02:17 - negative number over here if it is less
02:20 - than 0 or else it will be equal to 0 so
02:23 - basically we have checked whether the
02:25 - number is greater than 0 or else if it
02:27 - is less than 0 if no condition is
02:29 - getting satisfied after these two
02:30 - conditions and the number will be equal
02:32 - to 0 so we will simply print that the
02:34 - number is zero so over here we say
02:36 - number is 0 in this case so guys this is
02:40 - the way that we can easily write the
02:42 - Python program in order to check whether
02:44 - the enter number is a positive number
02:46 - negative number or else if it is a zero
02:49 - so guys let me just save this file now
02:50 - and try running this code so the very
02:52 - first thing that is being asked by the
02:54 - program is to enter the number so let's
02:56 - say we provide the number that is 12
02:58 - over here when we press enter as you can
03:01 - see entered number 12 is a positive
03:03 - number so basically this condition is
03:06 - getting satisfied because a number is
03:07 - greater than 0 and we are getting this
03:10 - statement being printed on the console
03:12 - now guys let us run this code once again
03:14 - this time what we will do is we will
03:15 - provide a number that is less than zero
03:17 - so let's say we provide minus 1 in this
03:20 - case and then when we press enter as you
03:22 - can see enter number that is minus 1 is
03:25 - a negative number why so because the
03:27 - very first thing that is number greater
03:29 - than 0 was not satisfied and then the
03:31 - control flow goes over here and it
03:33 - checks whether the number is less than
03:35 - zero so the condition that is number
03:37 - less than 0 is true in this case and
03:39 - that is the reason we are getting this
03:41 - statement being printed on the console
03:43 - that the entered number minus 1 is a
03:45 - negative number now guys let us check
03:47 - for the last statement that is number is
03:49 - zero so we have to provide the number
03:51 - from the user as 0 so let me just run
03:54 - this code once again over here we
03:55 - provide 0 as the number so when we press
03:58 - enter as you can see number is 0 in this
04:01 - case so this thing is getting printed
04:02 - over here now guys can we provide the
04:04 - float numbers as well so let's say when
04:06 - we run this code once again we want to
04:08 - provide a positive number that is a
04:10 - float number so we provide 2.13 in this
04:13 - case and when we press enter as you can
04:15 - see we are getting an error that is
04:17 - invalid literal for INT with base 10. so
04:20 - over here we are getting the error when
04:22 - we provide the float integer so what we
04:24 - need to do in order to avoid this error
04:26 - so basically since we are expecting of
04:29 - load number to be taken by this number
04:31 - variable but we are providing the int
04:34 - function over here we need to change it
04:36 - to a float number in this case is so
04:38 - that a float number gets stored in this
04:40 - number variable so now let us check this
04:42 - code once again I'll save this file and
04:44 - try running this code now so again we
04:46 - will provide the same number this time
04:47 - so let's say we provide 2.13 in this
04:50 - case when we press enter as you can see
04:52 - enter number 2.13 is a positive number
04:56 - so guys in this way we can also use the
04:58 - float numbers in order to check whether
05:00 - they are positive negative or zero let
05:02 - us take another input now I'll run this
05:05 - code once again we will say minus
05:07 - 0.01 so guys take this as a homework for
05:10 - you what will be the output of this
05:12 - particular number that is entered by the
05:14 - user whether it will be a positive
05:16 - number a negative number or else whether
05:18 - number is 0 will be printed comment in
05:21 - the comment section below let's see
05:22 - whether your answer is correct or not
05:24 - please make sure that you practice on
05:25 - your own so that on different inputs you
05:27 - get different output make sure that you
05:29 - like this video so that it reaches to
05:31 - more people and subscribe to this
05:32 - channel so that you get the
05:33 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
05:36 - the next video that we are going to talk
05:37 - talk about is a Python program to check
05:39 - if a number is odd or even so stay tuned
