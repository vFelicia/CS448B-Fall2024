00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to randomly select an
00:06 - element from the list so guys we can
00:09 - randomly select any element from the
00:11 - list in two ways so basically the first
00:13 - way is by using the random module and
00:17 - then the second way is by using the
00:18 - secret module over here so guys let us
00:21 - check this with the help of examples as
00:23 - well in the PS code so guys the very
00:25 - first thing that we will be doing is we
00:27 - will Define the list so let's say we
00:29 - have list one over here and then the
00:31 - elements that are present in the list is
00:33 - the combination of the numbers and the
00:35 - characters as well so let's say we have
00:37 - one and then followed by we have a and
00:40 - then let's say we have three and then
00:42 - let's say we have C as the character and
00:45 - then let's say we have two and then we
00:47 - have DSD character and then let's say we
00:49 - have the number 10 over here so Guys
00:51 - these are certain elements inside the
00:53 - list it is consisting of numbers as well
00:56 - as characters as well now let's say
00:57 - there is a requirement that you want to
00:59 - select one of the element from this list
01:01 - randomly so what we can do is the very
01:04 - first way is by using the random module
01:06 - so we need to import the random module
01:09 - in order to use it so basically the
01:11 - import statement is the very first
01:13 - statement in our Python program so we
01:15 - say import keyword followed by space and
01:18 - then we have the right now module over
01:20 - here so as you can see vs code is
01:22 - suggesting as this random module in this
01:24 - case so we are going to select this
01:26 - random module now guys simply we can use
01:28 - this random module so inside this random
01:31 - module there are multiple methods that
01:33 - you can use out of which one of the
01:35 - methods is the choice method so over
01:37 - here random followed by Dot and then we
01:40 - have something called as Choice method
01:41 - as you can see choose a random element
01:44 - from a non empty sequence basically this
01:47 - method will help us in order to select
01:49 - one of the elements from this list
01:51 - randomly so we are going to use this
01:54 - Choice method and then we are going to
01:56 - pass this list to this Choice method so
01:59 - we have list 1 here so guys basically
02:01 - this Choice method is expecting the
02:03 - parameter that is the sequence which is
02:05 - the list one that we have passed over
02:06 - here and then guys this entire statement
02:09 - can be present inside the print
02:11 - statement because this Choice method is
02:13 - going to return one of the elements from
02:15 - the list one randomly so guys we are
02:17 - using the print method in order to print
02:20 - that item that is being selected by this
02:23 - Choice method so guys this is the way
02:25 - that we can use the choice method inside
02:26 - the random module let me just save this
02:29 - file now and try running this code so as
02:31 - you can see we have got a that is one of
02:33 - the elements that is present inside this
02:35 - list as the random element let us run
02:38 - this code once again to see which is the
02:40 - next element that we get so as you can
02:42 - see after running this code once again
02:44 - we get another element over here that is
02:46 - two so guys randomly the choice method
02:49 - will help us in order to select one of
02:51 - the elements from this list guys it can
02:54 - be used in order to randomly select one
02:57 - of the cards from the deck of cards as
02:59 - well if you are dealing with an
03:00 - application which involves the deck of
03:03 - cards as one of the applications now
03:05 - guys let us see another method we can
03:07 - also use the secrets module in the same
03:09 - way in order to randomly choose one of
03:12 - the elements inside the list so guys
03:14 - what we will do is I'll just remove this
03:16 - line of code now and instead of random
03:18 - we will have the secrets module over
03:20 - here so we type Secrets module and then
03:23 - in the same way we can use the choice
03:25 - method inside the secrets module in
03:27 - order to randomly select one of the
03:30 - elements from the list so over here we
03:32 - use the secrets module followed by Dot
03:34 - and then we have the choice method once
03:37 - again inside this module and then again
03:39 - we are going to provide the list one as
03:41 - the parameter so this will help us in
03:43 - order to select one of the elements from
03:45 - the list now guys we are going to
03:48 - enclose this entire line of code inside
03:50 - the print statement so that the element
03:52 - is printed on the console over here so
03:55 - let me just save this file now and try
03:57 - running this code once again so as you
03:59 - can see this time we are are getting 3
04:00 - as the randomly selected element from
04:03 - this list let me just run this code once
04:06 - again over here again we are getting 3
04:08 - I'll find this code once again this time
04:10 - we are getting a over here and then we
04:13 - are getting 10 now and then we are
04:14 - getting d as well so guys randomly one
04:17 - of the elements is getting selected over
04:18 - here from the list by using the secrets
04:21 - module as well guys comment in the
04:23 - comment section below whether you will
04:24 - be able to predict what will be the next
04:27 - element that is chosen by Secrets or the
04:29 - random when you are using this Choice
04:31 - method let us see whether your answer is
04:34 - correct or not please make sure that you
04:36 - practice on your own so that on
04:37 - different inputs you get different
04:38 - outputs make sure that you like this
04:41 - video so that it reaches to more people
04:42 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
04:45 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
04:46 - as well the next video that we are going
04:48 - to talk about is Python program to check
04:51 - if a string is of node number or not so
04:54 - stay tuned
