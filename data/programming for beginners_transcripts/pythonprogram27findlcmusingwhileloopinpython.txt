00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to find LCM using while
00:06 - loop so guys the least common multiple
00:08 - or we also call it as LCM of two numbers
00:11 - is the smallest positive integer that is
00:14 - perfectly divisible by two given numbers
00:17 - so guys let's say for example the LCM of
00:20 - the two numbers that is 12 and 14 it
00:22 - will be equal to 84. now why so because
00:25 - if we see this number that is 2L when we
00:28 - multiply it by 7 we get 84 and then the
00:31 - other number that is 14 if we again
00:33 - multiply it by 6 we will get 84. so guys
00:36 - both these numbers needs to be
00:38 - multiplied by another number in order to
00:40 - get the same result which is the least
00:42 - common multiple of these two numbers and
00:45 - when we divide this number that is 84 by
00:47 - 12 and 84 by 14 the remainder must be 0
00:51 - in both the cases so guys such a number
00:53 - which is greater than or equal to the
00:56 - highest number out of these two numbers
00:58 - in such a way that when that number
00:59 - number is divided by both the numbers
01:01 - the remainder must be 0 and that is what
01:04 - we call it as the least common multiple
01:06 - so guys let us implement the Python
01:08 - program in order to find the LCM of the
01:10 - two given numbers using the vs code over
01:12 - here now guys let's say we have the two
01:14 - numbers that is num1 it is equal to 12
01:16 - and num2 it is equal to 14 so we are
01:19 - going to take the same example that we
01:21 - have just seen over here we will simply
01:23 - print this statement that is LCM of two
01:28 - numbers and then we will print both the
01:30 - numbers first number and the second
01:32 - number and then is and then the third
01:35 - number will be the result that is the
01:37 - LCM of both the numbers and Then
01:39 - followed by dot format in order to print
01:41 - these numbers so we have num1 first and
01:44 - then we have num2 followed by compute
01:47 - LCM so guys this is the method that we
01:50 - are going to Define which will take two
01:52 - parameters that is num1 and num2
01:54 - respectively so guys over here what we
01:57 - will be doing is we will Define this
01:58 - function that will help Us in order to
02:01 - find the LCM of both these numbers so
02:03 - over here we have the def keyword
02:05 - followed by the name of the function and
02:07 - it is expecting two parameters it is
02:09 - number one and number two so we will
02:11 - take both these numbers in X and Y
02:14 - variable over here and then we will
02:16 - Define this function so what we are
02:18 - supposed to do is we are supposed to
02:19 - find the greater number out of these two
02:21 - numbers so we say if x is greater than y
02:25 - so over here we say x is greater than y
02:27 - then we simply have to assign the value
02:30 - of x to another variable so let's say we
02:33 - provide a variable name that is greater
02:35 - it is equal to X in this case and if X
02:37 - is not greater than y then probably Y is
02:40 - greater than x so over here inside the
02:43 - else part we will say greater it is
02:46 - equal to Y now guys when X is greater
02:48 - than y then greater will be X and if Y
02:51 - is greater than or equal to X then y
02:54 - will be greater over here so when both
02:56 - the numbers are equal this condition
02:58 - will get satisfied and create data will
03:00 - be assigned the value of y in this case
03:02 - which is perfectly fine as per our logic
03:04 - now guys we have to check whether this
03:06 - greater number when we divided by both
03:08 - the numbers that is X and Y it should
03:10 - give us the remainder as 0 and if it is
03:12 - not giving the remainder as 0 we need to
03:14 - increment the greater number by 1. so
03:17 - guys over here we will be using the
03:18 - while Loops over here inside the while
03:21 - loop the condition will be true always
03:22 - that means the control flow will every
03:25 - time come over here inside the while
03:27 - loop and we should have the break
03:28 - statement inside the while loop so that
03:30 - the control flow comes out of the while
03:32 - loop so over here what will be the break
03:34 - statement we are supposed to check
03:36 - whether this greater number so we say if
03:39 - greater and then we do percent X which
03:43 - means we are dividing the greater number
03:44 - by X and we are finding the remainder
03:46 - whether this remainder is equal to 0 and
03:49 - then again the same operation we have to
03:52 - do that is create a percent and this
03:55 - time we will be using the number that is
03:56 - y is it equal to 0 this time so guys is
04:00 - basically whatever the greater number is
04:02 - it should be perfectly divisible by X
04:04 - and Y over here in which case we will
04:06 - get the remainders as 0 and if this is
04:08 - the case that means LCM is equal to
04:10 - Greater this time so over here we will
04:12 - have another variable that is LCM it is
04:15 - equal to Greater so this greater number
04:18 - when divided by both that is X and Y in
04:21 - such a way that the remainders is 0 in
04:23 - both the cases then that greater number
04:25 - becomes the LCM of these two numbers
04:28 - that is X and Y and that is what we have
04:30 - assigned over here that is LCM is equal
04:32 - to Greater and we have to come out of
04:34 - this while loop because we have
04:36 - successfully achieved our task that is
04:38 - to find the LCM of these two numbers so
04:41 - guys we come out of this while loop
04:43 - using the break statement now guys what
04:45 - if one of the conditions is not
04:46 - satisfying over here or both the
04:48 - conditions is not satisfying so we have
04:50 - to increment the value of Greater by 1
04:53 - over here so greater it is equal to
04:55 - Greater plus 1 in this case so guys
04:58 - basically we are incrementing the number
04:59 - y1 and again we are checking whether now
05:02 - this number that is greater if it is
05:04 - divided by X and Y whether the remainder
05:07 - is 0 or not and ultimately we will find
05:09 - a number which is assigned to Greater in
05:11 - such a way that when it is divided by
05:13 - both X and Y the remainder will be 0 and
05:15 - then in that case the LCM is equal to
05:18 - Greater now guys after this while loop
05:20 - what we have to do is simply we have to
05:22 - return this LCM value so we say return
05:24 - LCM and that number will be displayed
05:27 - over here instead of these curly braces
05:29 - as the third number which will be
05:31 - returned using this particular function
05:32 - so guys let me just save this file now
05:34 - and try running this code so as we can
05:37 - see LCM of two numbers that is 12 and 14
05:39 - is 84 and that is what we were expecting
05:42 - over here 84 is the LCM of these two
05:44 - numbers now guys let's say we have the
05:46 - two numbers as 12 and 24 so what will be
05:49 - the LCM so in this case the greater
05:52 - number is 24 and when we multiply 12 by
05:55 - 2 we again get 24 and when we multiply
05:57 - 24 by 1 we again get 24 and LCM in this
06:01 - case should be 24 now so let me just
06:03 - save this file now and try running this
06:05 - code so as we can see LCM of two numbers
06:07 - 12 and 24 is 24. now guys what if both
06:11 - the numbers is same so when we say 2424
06:13 - as number one and number two Let me just
06:16 - save this file now and try running this
06:17 - code so the LCM of two numbers 24 and 24
06:20 - it is 24 again now guys what if the
06:23 - first number is 200 and second number is
06:26 - 100 so the LCM in this case should be
06:28 - 200 that's because when we multiply this
06:31 - 100 by 2 we again get 200 over here and
06:34 - 200 multiplied by 1 is again 200 so when
06:37 - we run this code once again we see LCM
06:39 - of two numbers 200 and 100 is 200. now
06:43 - guys what if the number one is 200 and
06:45 - second number is 150 what will be the
06:48 - LCM in this case comment in the comment
06:50 - section below let us see whether your
06:51 - answer is correct or not so guys please
06:53 - make sure that you practice on your own
06:55 - so that you get the result of the LCM of
06:57 - these two numbers that is 201
06:59 - 50 so that you can comment in the
