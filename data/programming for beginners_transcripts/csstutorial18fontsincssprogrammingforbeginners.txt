00:00 - so now we will see fonts in CSS so guys
00:03 - basically there are multiple properties
00:05 - related to fonts in CSS and this we are
00:08 - going to check with the help of examples
00:10 - as well so basically the first property
00:12 - is the font family which will help us in
00:15 - order to specify the font of a text so
00:18 - guys let us check this with the help of
00:19 - example in vs code over here so simply
00:22 - I'm going to remove the previous line of
00:24 - code that we had return from the HTML
00:27 - and the CSS files as well so in the HTM
00:30 - ml file we are going to have the div
00:32 - element in this case and let us generate
00:34 - some random text over here so as you can
00:36 - see we have generated the random text
00:38 - using the lurm M abbreviation let me
00:41 - just save this file now and try
00:43 - reloading this page on the browser so as
00:45 - you can see this is the text that we
00:47 - have written inside our Dev element now
00:50 - guys this is the default font family
00:52 - over here we have not provided any font
00:54 - family in our external CSS file so how
00:58 - do we provide the font family in the
01:00 - style. CSS file over here so simply we
01:03 - are going to go inside the style. CSS
01:06 - file and for the div element we are
01:08 - going to set the font family in this
01:11 - case now guys when we provide the font
01:13 - family property as you can see there are
01:15 - multiple values in this case to be
01:18 - provided as the font family now guys
01:20 - what is the meaning of these multiple
01:22 - values that are separated by comma so
01:25 - over here let us say we want to provide
01:27 - the aial font family so when we select
01:30 - this as you can see the first font
01:32 - family is aial and Then followed by
01:34 - comma we have something called as
01:36 - helvetica and then we have s s so guys
01:39 - basically this is nothing but a fallback
01:41 - mechanism that will work in such a way
01:44 - that first of all the web browser will
01:46 - check whether the aial font family is
01:48 - being installed locally on that
01:50 - particular browser and if yes then the
01:53 - text will be applied this particular
01:55 - font family and if not then the
01:58 - helvetica will be checked whether
01:59 - whether it is present or not and if it
02:01 - is present then helvetica will be
02:03 - provided and if this is also not present
02:06 - then s siif is the generic font family
02:09 - name that will be applied which is
02:10 - having the group of different values for
02:13 - the font family over here so guys
02:15 - basically the last name for the font
02:17 - family CSS property will be the generic
02:20 - font family so as you can see it
02:22 - specifies a prioritized list of font
02:24 - family names or generic family names so
02:27 - some of the browser versions might not
02:28 - have the first for the second font
02:31 - family value and this is the fallback
02:33 - mechanism that is being used over here
02:35 - now guys let us check how this font
02:37 - family will be displayed on the UI so
02:39 - let me just save this file now and try
02:41 - reloading this page on the browser so as
02:43 - you can see the font has been updated
02:46 - now with the help of the font family CSS
02:48 - property similarly if we provide some
02:50 - other font family over here so let's say
02:52 - we provide Times New Roman font family
02:55 - in this case so first of all this Times
02:57 - New Roman will be checked whether the
02:59 - browser is having this particular font
03:01 - family if not then this times font
03:04 - family will be checked and if this is
03:05 - also not present then the siif generic
03:08 - family will be applied to the text over
03:10 - here so guys let me just save this file
03:12 - now and try reloading this page before
03:14 - reloading you will be seeing that the
03:16 - font family will be updated over here to
03:19 - Times New Roman so when we reload this
03:21 - page as you can see this is the text
03:24 - that is being displayed with the font
03:25 - family of Times New Roman over here let
03:28 - us update to some other font Family
03:30 - Value in this case so let us select
03:33 - Verana over here so let me just save
03:35 - this file now and try reloading this
03:37 - page once again on the browser so as you
03:39 - can see the font family has been updated
03:41 - over here and this is how you can apply
03:43 - the font family to your text based on
03:45 - your requirements now guys let us move
03:47 - to another property over here so we have
03:49 - something called as font style in this
03:51 - case which will specify whether the text
03:54 - needs to be displayed as it so guys let
03:57 - us check that as well so over here
03:58 - simply we can Pro provide font style CSS
04:01 - property and for this style we have
04:03 - multiple values that is ITC or normal or
04:06 - obli so guys basically by default we
04:09 - have the normal value so let us see how
04:11 - the text will be displayed when we
04:13 - provide the value as italic for font
04:16 - family CSS property so let me just save
04:19 - this file now and try reloading this
04:21 - page once again on the browser as you
04:23 - can see the value of ITC is being
04:25 - provided over here as the font style CSS
04:28 - property now guys let us move to another
04:30 - CSS property we have something called as
04:32 - font weight over here so let us check
04:35 - that as well which will help us in order
04:37 - to specify the weight of the font so
04:39 - guys over here simply we will say font
04:42 - weight property and we have multiple
04:44 - numbers that we can provide also we can
04:46 - provide the value that is bold over here
04:48 - or Bolder or lighter so by default we
04:51 - have the value that is normal so what if
04:53 - we provide the Bold value in this case
04:56 - let me just save this file now and try
04:58 - reloading this page once again on the
04:59 - browser so as you can see this is the
05:01 - meaning of bold font weight in this case
05:04 - and based on your requirements if you
05:06 - want to display the text in this way you
05:08 - can provide the font weight over here
05:10 - now guys let us move to another property
05:12 - we have something called as font size in
05:14 - this case which sets the size of the
05:16 - text and we can use the various units
05:19 - which is pixels and EM over here so guys
05:21 - let us check this with the help of
05:23 - example in VSS code so let us have
05:25 - another paragraph in this case so we
05:27 - will have the P tag over here and then
05:29 - simply we will say this is a paragraph
05:32 - So guys we are going to apply the font
05:34 - size property on this paragraph let me
05:36 - just save this file now and try
05:38 - reloading this page once again on the
05:39 - browser so as you can see this is a
05:41 - paragraph text is getting displayed so
05:44 - guys how do we provide the font size
05:46 - property to this paragraph so simply we
05:48 - are going to come in this CSS file we
05:50 - are going to provide the P tag and we
05:53 - are going to say font size in this case
05:55 - so guys by default the font size is 16
05:58 - pixels on most of the browsers and let's
06:01 - say we want to provide 22 pixels as font
06:03 - size so let me just save this file now
06:06 - and try reloading this page once again
06:08 - on the browser so as you can see the
06:10 - size of this particular font has
06:11 - increased to 22 pixels let us inspect
06:15 - this element so when we right click on
06:16 - this HTML element and click on the
06:19 - inspect option you will be seeing all
06:21 - the CSS properties that are being
06:23 - provided to this paragraph tag over here
06:26 - when we uncheck this font size as you
06:28 - can see this is the default font size
06:30 - for the paragraph tag and when we check
06:32 - it with the 22 pixels value the text is
06:35 - getting displayed with the help of font
06:37 - size of 22 pixels if we increase the
06:39 - size to 26 pixels so over here when we
06:42 - change it to 26 you will notice on the
06:45 - UI that the size will increase over here
06:47 - so when we make it as 26 pixels as you
06:50 - can see the size of the paragraph has
06:52 - increased more so in this way you can
06:54 - provide the various font size to the
06:56 - text let me just reload this page once
06:58 - again on the browser so that the changes
07:00 - that we have made on the CSS file is
07:02 - getting reflected on the page and guys
07:05 - apart from this we have something called
07:07 - as em unit as well so basically 1 em is
07:10 - equal to the current font size and by
07:13 - default the current font size that is
07:15 - the text size in the browsers is 16
07:18 - pixels so when we provide 1 em as the
07:20 - font size over here it will be the
07:22 - default font size of the browser so let
07:25 - us check that as well we provide 1 em as
07:28 - the font size in in this case let me
07:30 - just save this file now and try
07:32 - reloading this page so as you can see
07:34 - this is by default 16 pixels over here
07:36 - if you want to double this size that is
07:38 - 32 pixels simply we can provide 2 em in
07:41 - this case so let me just save this file
07:43 - now and try reloading this page once
07:45 - again on the browser so this is the 32
07:48 - pixels font size that is getting
07:50 - displayed over here now guys what if we
07:52 - want to make the size as 28 pixels so
07:55 - simply we can come to calculator over
07:57 - here and for this 28 pixels we are going
07:59 - to divide it by 16 since 1 em is equal
08:03 - to 16 pixels so we need to get a number
08:06 - that is corresponding to the EM unit for
08:08 - which the pixels unit is 28 so let me
08:11 - just check that as well so it is 1.75 em
08:14 - so guys basically the EM unit also
08:17 - allows you to provide the numbers in
08:19 - decimal so let us check this as well
08:22 - when we provide 175 em over here what
08:25 - will happen so we have provided 1.75 em
08:29 - let me just save this file now and try
08:31 - reloading this page once again on the
08:33 - browser so as you can see the size has
08:35 - been updated to 1.75 Em which is
08:38 - equivalent to 28 pixels over here and if
08:41 - we want to make it as 24 pixels simply
08:44 - we will say 1.5 Em which will correspond
08:47 - to the 24 pixels if you calculate this
08:50 - so when we say 24 / 16 it will give us
08:54 - 1.5 s the EM unit so guys let me just
08:57 - save this file now and try reload in
08:59 - this page once again on the browser so
09:01 - as you can see this is the 24 pixels or
09:04 - 1.5 em font size for this particular
09:07 - text now guys it is very important that
09:09 - we use the text size that is the font
09:11 - size with the help of the EM unit so
09:13 - that on different browsers the text is
09:16 - automatically scaling up or down and it
09:18 - is recommended in order to use a
09:21 - combination of percent as well in the
09:23 - body tag along with this em so guys
09:26 - inside this style. CSS file simply we
09:28 - can say body and then for the font size
09:32 - property over here so simply we are
09:34 - going to say font size as 100% so guys
09:37 - what will happen is the font size for
09:40 - all the HTML elements inside the body
09:42 - will be set as 100% and whenever we are
09:45 - going to use the font size as the EM
09:47 - unit for the other HTML elements it will
09:50 - properly scale up or scale Down based on
09:53 - the browser and the device size on which
09:56 - the user is using the web page so guys
09:58 - this is one of the best practices that
10:00 - you must follow while providing the CSS
10:03 - property of font size to the different
10:05 - text element now guys we have something
10:07 - called as font Shand property that will
10:09 - help us in order to provide the values
10:12 - of all these CSS properties related to
10:15 - font in just one CSS property that is
10:18 - font in this case so guys I'll leave
10:20 - this up to you as a homework for you so
10:22 - that you can practice on your own and
10:24 - use the different values for the
10:26 - different font properties that is
10:28 - related to text so guys comment in the
