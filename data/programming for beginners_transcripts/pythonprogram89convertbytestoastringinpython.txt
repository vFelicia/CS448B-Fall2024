00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to convert
00:04 - bytes to a string so guys basically we
00:07 - can easily convert the bytes to string
00:09 - using the decode method and we are going
00:11 - to check this with the help of example
00:13 - as well now guys we are going to take
00:15 - this example that we have the keyword
00:17 - that is yes and then followed by some
00:19 - bytes over here so I'm going to Simply
00:22 - copy this and we are going to convert it
00:24 - into the string using the decode method
00:26 - so let us move to the vs code over here
00:28 - now guys what we will do is simply we
00:30 - have the print statement and inside this
00:33 - in order to represent the bytes we have
00:36 - to use the b letter over here and then
00:39 - followed by double quotes inside which
00:41 - we need to provide the bytes in this
00:43 - case so let's say we have the string
00:45 - that is yes and then the bytes that are
00:47 - being represented in this format and
00:49 - then guys what we can do is after this
00:51 - double quote we can use Dot and then we
00:53 - have something called as decode function
00:56 - so guys over here we will be using the
00:58 - decode method and inside this we will
00:59 - will be providing the utf-8 so basically
01:02 - this is the format into which we want to
01:04 - convert this by so guys this is a very
01:07 - simple way in order to convert the bytes
01:09 - into the string let me just save this
01:11 - file now and try running this code so as
01:13 - you can see we have got yes and then we
01:15 - have this tick mark over here in green
01:17 - color and that is what is being
01:19 - represented by this series of characters
01:21 - now guys what if we don't provide P
01:23 - letter in this case so what will happen
01:25 - so let me just remove that and let me
01:28 - just save this file now and try running
01:29 - this code once again so as you can see
01:31 - we have got the error that states Str
01:34 - object has no attribute D code basically
01:37 - since we are enclosing this entire
01:39 - string into double quotes it is being
01:41 - taken as a string format and we don't
01:43 - have decode function that can be used on
01:46 - a string value so in this case we need
01:48 - to use this P letter so that this
01:51 - content inside the double quotes is
01:52 - being interpreted as the bytes and then
01:55 - those are converted to string so let me
01:57 - just save this file now and try running
01:58 - this code once again so as you can see
02:00 - we have got this tick mark once again
02:02 - over here on the terminal so guys next
02:04 - time if you have any bytes over here and
02:07 - if you want to convert it into string so
02:09 - this is the simple statement that you
02:11 - can use in order to achieve your task
02:13 - please make sure that you like this

02:22 - to talk about is Python program for
