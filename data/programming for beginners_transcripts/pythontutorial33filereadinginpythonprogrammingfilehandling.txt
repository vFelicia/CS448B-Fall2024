00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about file reading in Python Programming
00:06 - so guys a file is a container in
00:09 - computer storage devices used for
00:11 - storing data so when we want to read
00:13 - from a file we need to open it first
00:16 - when we are done it needs to be closed
00:19 - so that the resources that are tied with
00:21 - the file are freed so guys we are going
00:23 - to check this with the help of example
00:24 - how we can open the file in order to
00:27 - read the content of the file and then
00:29 - after that we can close the file as well
00:31 - so basically in Python a file operation
00:34 - takes place in the following order first
00:36 - of all we have to open the file then the
00:39 - next thing is we read the file content
00:41 - and then after reading the file content
00:43 - we close the file so basically the first
00:45 - operation that is opening the file we
00:47 - can use the open method to open a file
00:50 - so as you can see for example over here
00:52 - we are providing the variable name on
00:54 - the left hand side and then on the right
00:56 - hand side we have the open function and
00:59 - then we have the any part of the file
01:01 - where the file is stored and then by
01:03 - default it is opened in the read mode we
01:06 - can also use the second parameter and
01:08 - provide the character that is R for
01:10 - reading the file and in order to write
01:12 - into the file we use wsd character over
01:15 - here in this case and then guys after
01:17 - this we can read the file in Python by
01:19 - using the read method so basically this
01:22 - variable that we had used on the left
01:24 - hand side we can use the same variable
01:26 - over here in order to call the function
01:28 - that is read and this will help us in
01:31 - order to read the content into the
01:33 - variable that is read content and then
01:35 - in order to close the file we can simply
01:37 - use the close method so guys let us
01:40 - check all this with the help of examples
01:41 - now over here so let's say we have the
01:43 - variable name that is file 1 and Then
01:46 - followed by equal to and then we use the
01:48 - function name that is open in order to
01:51 - open the file and then inside the open
01:53 - and close parenthesis we are going to
01:55 - have the path of the file that we want
01:57 - to open so guys over here I have active
02:00 - test file for which I have written some
02:02 - content over here so we have these four
02:04 - lines inside the test file so what we
02:06 - can do is so guys we have to copy the
02:08 - entire path of this directory this is
02:10 - very important in whichever directory
02:13 - your file is you have to copy the entire
02:15 - path of that directory and paste this
02:17 - into your code so that your code can
02:19 - access that directory and the file that
02:22 - you want to read so basically over here
02:24 - inside the double quotes we have to
02:26 - provide the directory path and Then
02:28 - followed by the name of the file that we
02:30 - want to read so over here I'll just copy
02:32 - the name of the file that is the test
02:34 - file and paste this over here followed
02:37 - by dot txt now guys it is very important
02:39 - that while you are copying the directory
02:41 - path you will be getting this
02:43 - backslashes over here so you have to
02:45 - provide another backslash since this one
02:48 - backslash is acting as the Escape
02:50 - character so you have to provide two
02:52 - backslashes over here every time that
02:54 - you are providing the directory path so
02:56 - I'll just provide extra backslashes over
02:58 - here at every instance in this directory
03:01 - path so guys this is our entire path
03:03 - over here followed by the test file that
03:05 - is the file name and then the extension
03:07 - that is dot txt now guys the second step
03:10 - is to read this file so the first step
03:12 - is completed that we have opened the
03:14 - file now the next step is to read the
03:16 - content so we will say read underscore
03:19 - content as the variable name followed by
03:23 - equal to we use this file 1 variable
03:25 - that we have used in order to open the
03:28 - file followed by Dot and then we have
03:30 - the read method so this method will help
03:33 - us in order to read the content into
03:35 - this read content variable and then guys
03:38 - simply we can print the read content
03:41 - variables over here we can say read
03:43 - content so let me just save this file
03:45 - now and try running this code so as you
03:48 - can see we are getting all the four
03:49 - lines that are present inside the test
03:51 - file so if I open the test file over
03:53 - here once again it says this is a test
03:55 - line in a test file so the same line is
03:58 - printed over here on the a console this
04:01 - is a test line in a test file similarly
04:03 - we have the other three lines it is this
04:05 - is another test line then we have this
04:07 - is third line and then this is fourth
04:10 - line in test file so all those lines
04:12 - that are present inside the test file
04:14 - are being printed over here on the
04:16 - console so guys this is one of the
04:18 - easiest way that you can open the file
04:20 - in a particular directory read the
04:22 - content by using the read function and
04:25 - then you can print the content of the
04:27 - file by using the print function now
04:29 - guys after these operations are
04:31 - completed what you have to do is you
04:33 - have to close the file which is very
04:34 - important so as you can see when we are
04:37 - done with performing operations on the
04:39 - file we need to properly close the file
04:41 - now closing a file will free up the
04:43 - resources that were tied with the file
04:45 - it is done using the close method in
04:48 - Python so basically after printing the
04:50 - content what we can do is simply we can
04:53 - provide a file 1 followed by Dot and
04:56 - then we can have the close method being
04:58 - called so let me just save this file now
05:00 - and before running this code we will
05:02 - have another print function over here
05:04 - and we will print the statement that is
05:06 - file is closed in order to confirm that
05:09 - the control flow has reached the final
05:11 - statement over here in our code so let
05:14 - me just save this file now and try
05:15 - running this code so as you can see all
05:17 - the four lines are being printed over
05:19 - here from the file once again and then
05:21 - we are also getting file is closed being
05:23 - printed over here and in this way we
05:25 - have already closed the file by using
05:27 - the close function as well so guys this
05:29 - is the way you can read the content of
05:31 - the file just by using these four lines
05:34 - of code we can easily read the entire
05:37 - content of any of the file that we want
05:39 - to read based on our requirements so
05:41 - guys that's it in this video please make
05:43 - sure that you practice on your own so
05:44 - that on different inputs you get
05:46 - different outputs please make sure that
05:48 - you like this video so that it reaches
05:49 - to more people and subscribe to this
05:51 - channel so that you get the
05:52 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
05:54 - the next video that we are going to talk
05:56 - about is with open syntax to read file
05:58 - in Python programming so stay tuned
