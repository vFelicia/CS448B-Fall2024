00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to print Floyd's triangle
00:06 - so guys this is the Floyd's triangle
00:08 - pattern as you can see so we have four
00:11 - number of rows over here and in the
00:13 - first row we have the number one in the
00:15 - second row we have numbers two and then
00:17 - three and then in the third row we have
00:19 - three numbers four five six in the
00:22 - fourth row we have seven eight nine ten
00:24 - so guys basically with the increase in
00:27 - the number of rows there's a increase in
00:29 - the number of elements that are present
00:31 - inside each row over here and also there
00:34 - is a global number that is being
00:35 - displayed which is getting incremented
00:38 - after each printing over here so guys
00:40 - how the algorithm for pattern programs
00:42 - work so basically each pattern program
00:44 - has two or more than two Loops the
00:46 - number of the loop depends on the
00:48 - complexity of the pattern or the logic
00:50 - basically for this particular pattern we
00:52 - will have only two for Loops over here
00:54 - and then the first for Loop will work
00:57 - for the row the second for Loop that is
00:59 - the nested follow will work for the
01:01 - column so guys let us check this with
01:03 - the help of Python program how we can
01:05 - print the Floyd's triangle using the vs
01:07 - code over here so guys the very first
01:09 - thing that we will be doing is we will
01:11 - ask the user to enter the number of rows
01:13 - which will be converted to the integer
01:16 - over here so inside this end function we
01:18 - have the input function and we will ask
01:21 - the user to enter number of rows and
01:26 - then colon so guys once the user enters
01:29 - the number of rows it will be of the
01:30 - string data type so this end function
01:33 - will help us in order to convert that
01:35 - string to the integer which will be
01:37 - stored in this rows variable over here
01:39 - now guys simply we can have for Loop
01:41 - over here so for I in range now this
01:45 - range it will go from 0 up to the number
01:48 - of rows that is entered by the user
01:50 - because there is many number of rows we
01:52 - need to print as you can see in this
01:54 - example so guys over here the range is
01:56 - going from 0 up to rows and then inside
01:59 - this we will have the the nested for
02:01 - Loop so over here for J and then again
02:04 - we have the range function over here it
02:07 - will go from 0 up to the value of I so
02:10 - guys initially the value of I is 0 so it
02:13 - will go from 0 up to I plus 1 over here
02:16 - that's because the second parameter is
02:18 - not included when we use the range
02:19 - function so basically in the first
02:22 - iteration it will go from 0 up to I
02:24 - value is 0 so 0 plus 1 is 1 so 0 comma 1
02:28 - which means only once the control flow
02:30 - will go inside this for Loop over here
02:33 - which is the nested for Loop that is the
02:35 - inner for low and then after this colon
02:38 - what we have to do is we have to print
02:39 - this number one over here so guys what
02:42 - we can do is before this outer for Loop
02:44 - we can have the number variables over
02:46 - here so number initially the value is 1
02:49 - in this case and then the same number we
02:51 - need to print so one here we will say
02:53 - print and then we will say this number
02:56 - now it should not go to the next line
02:58 - until the the control flow is printing
03:01 - inside this inner for Loop so over here
03:04 - we will use the end parameter and then
03:06 - we will separate the numbers using the
03:08 - space character over here and then guys
03:10 - after this print statement also the
03:12 - number needs to be incremented by 1
03:14 - because next time the number is getting
03:17 - printed the new number is 2 and then we
03:20 - have 3 and then we have 4 5 6 and so on
03:23 - every time after the printing of the
03:25 - previous number the next number will be
03:27 - incremented by one so over here we will
03:29 - simply say number plus it is equal to 1
03:32 - which means we are incrementing the
03:34 - value of number by 1 over here now guys
03:37 - after this inner for Loop what we can do
03:39 - is we have to come to the next line in
03:41 - order to print the remaining number of
03:43 - rows over here so simply we can provide
03:45 - the print function so that the control
03:47 - flow comes to the next line in this case
03:49 - so guys this is the program that will
03:51 - help us in order to print the fluids
03:54 - triangle based on the number of rows
03:56 - that is entered by the user so guys let
03:58 - us check this I'll save this file I love
04:00 - and try running this code so as you can
04:02 - see user is being asked to enter the
04:04 - number of rows so let us provide 4 as
04:06 - the number of rows initially when we
04:08 - press enter as you can see we have got
04:10 - the fluids triangle over here it says 1
04:13 - and then 2 3 and then on the next line
04:15 - we have four five six and then we have 7
04:18 - 8 9 10. so guys this is the fluids
04:20 - triangle that we were expecting to be
04:22 - printed on the console let me just run
04:24 - this code once again and this time we
04:26 - will provide 10 number of rows over here
04:28 - when we press enter as you can see we
04:31 - have got 10 number of rows over here and
04:33 - there's a beautiful Floyd's triangle
04:35 - that can be seen on the terminal each
04:37 - time the number is getting incremented
04:39 - by 1 and then accordingly we reach the
04:42 - number to 55 which is the last element
04:44 - of the last row over here which is
04:46 - having 10 number of columns in this case
04:49 - so guys this is the way that we can
04:50 - easily write a Python program to print
04:52 - the Floyd triangle please make sure that
04:54 - you practice on your own so that on
04:56 - different inputs you have different
04:57 - outputs make sure that you like this
04:59 - video so that it reaches to more people
05:01 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
05:03 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
05:05 - as well the next video that we are going
05:07 - to talk about is Python program to merge
05:10 - two dictionaries so stay tuned
