00:00 - so now we will see input Type image in
00:02 - HTML form so guys basically we can have
00:05 - the input tag along with the type that
00:07 - is image which defines an image as a
00:10 - submit button so guys inside of the
00:12 - submit button we can also have the input
00:14 - type that is image over here that will
00:17 - act as a submit button and it will be
00:19 - the image that will be displayed as a
00:21 - button over here now guys the path of
00:23 - the image is specified in the SRC
00:25 - attribute so let us check this with the
00:27 - help of examples and vs code as well it
00:30 - acts as a submit button and sends the
00:32 - coordinates of the user click as X and Y
00:35 - coordinates so guys let us move to the
00:37 - vs code over here and what we will be
00:39 - doing is after the submit button we will
00:41 - also have the input type that is image
00:44 - so let us provide the line brakes over
00:46 - here so that the image is being
00:48 - displayed on the next line and then over
00:50 - here we will provide the input followed
00:52 - by colon and this time we will have the
00:54 - image in this case so guys it is
00:56 - important to note that we are having
00:58 - this input Type image inside the form
01:01 - over here so that the form attributes
01:03 - can be submitted and the form that is
01:05 - having the method attribute as get will
01:07 - help us in order to see all the value
01:10 - that is being set by the user inside the
01:13 - browser URL so guys let us check this we
01:15 - have the input tag with the Type image
01:18 - over here and for the source part we
01:20 - will have one of the images that is
01:22 - sample image that I have already stored
01:24 - in this directory path where this
01:26 - particular test.html file is present now
01:30 - guys as the alternate we will provide
01:32 - submit as the value over here in case
01:35 - there is any issue as far as displaying
01:37 - of this image is concerned now guys
01:39 - apart from this we will also set the
01:41 - width and height of the image so let us
01:43 - say we have the width attribute as 50
01:45 - pixels over here so we set it as 50 PX
01:48 - and then let's say we have the height
01:50 - attribute as well and we have the same
01:52 - value that is 50 pixel in this case so
01:55 - guys let me just save this file now and
01:56 - try reloading this page once again on
01:58 - the browser so as you can see this is
02:00 - the image that we have set over here
02:03 - guys the height and width of this
02:04 - particular image is set in such a way
02:06 - that it is not looking very clear but
02:08 - for the example purpose we will see what
02:11 - happens when the user clicks on this
02:12 - particular image over here so guys let's
02:15 - say we click on this bottom right of
02:17 - this particular image so when we click
02:19 - on this as you can see the attributes
02:21 - are getting displayed over here in the
02:23 - URL so you can see that BG color that is
02:25 - the background color that is coming from
02:28 - the Color Picker over here and then
02:30 - apart from that we have the birth date
02:31 - date time as well as email and then in
02:34 - the end as you can see we have something
02:36 - called as X which is 47 and then we also
02:39 - have y that is equal to 47 so this is
02:42 - nothing but the attributes where the
02:44 - user has clicked on this particular
02:46 - image over here now let us click on this
02:48 - image once again somewhere over here
02:50 - that is at the top left so when we click
02:52 - on this so as you can see again the
02:54 - attributes are updated over here and you
02:56 - can see that the X attribute is now set
02:58 - as two and Y y attribute is now set as
03:01 - one over here so guys in this way we can
03:03 - come to know at which particular
03:05 - coordinates by using the X and Y
03:07 - coordinates over here the user has
03:09 - clicked when the user clicks on the
03:11 - image that represents the submit button
03:13 - inside the form so guys this is the
03:15 - basic functionality of the input tag
03:17 - that is having the type that is image
03:19 - over here we can set it as the normal
03:22 - image that is by having the source
03:23 - attribute we can set the image for this
03:26 - particular submit button and let's say
03:27 - when the image is not present inside the
03:29 - directory so let me just provide one
03:32 - over here that is sample uncore image
03:34 - 1.png which is not present inside that
03:37 - directory let me just save this file now
03:39 - and try reloading this page once again
03:41 - on the browser so as you can see since
03:43 - the image is not present so we can see
03:45 - what text is being provided as the alt
03:48 - attribute so that is what we can see
03:50 - over here that is submit in this case so
03:52 - guys in this way we should be having the
03:54 - alt attribute as well in case if there
03:56 - is any issues as far as displaying of
03:59 - the image is concerned on the browser
04:01 - let me just save this file once again
04:03 - and reload this page on the browser and
04:05 - if we click somewhere in the middle of
04:07 - this image so you can see that the
04:09 - parameters are updated once again and
04:11 - this time the x value is 23 and the Y
04:14 - value is 25 so guys since we have set
04:17 - the height and width as 50 pixels over
04:19 - here so we will see all the numbers
04:21 - between 0 to 15 in this case based on
04:24 - where the user clicks on that particular
04:27 - image so comment in the comment section
