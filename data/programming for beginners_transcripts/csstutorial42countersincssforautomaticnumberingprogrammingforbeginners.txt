00:00 - so now we will see counters in CSS for
00:03 - automatic numbering so guys basically
00:05 - CSS counters are variables which are
00:08 - maintained by CSS whose values can be
00:11 - incremented by CSS rules to track how
00:14 - many times they are used and guys this
00:16 - we are going to check with the help of
00:17 - examples as well so counters let you
00:20 - adjust the appearance of content based
00:23 - on its placement in the document so guys
00:25 - basically we are going to have certain
00:27 - list of values for which we are not
00:29 - going to have the numbers inside our
00:31 - HTML code but we will be using certain
00:34 - CSS rules in order to number those list
00:37 - of items so guys let us move to the VSS
00:39 - code in order to check the example of
00:41 - counters in CSS over here so simply I'm
00:44 - going to remove the previous lines of
00:46 - code from the HTML and the CSS files
00:48 - that we have written now guys inside our
00:50 - HTML file what we are going to do is
00:53 - first of all we are going to have the
00:55 - edge1 tag over here and we will say
00:57 - below our sum of the pro programming
01:00 - languages so guys basically we have this
01:02 - particular header that is below our some
01:05 - of the programming languages and let us
01:07 - have certain programming languages
01:08 - inside the h2 tag over here so guys
01:11 - basically inside the h2 tag we will have
01:14 - certain programming languages so let's
01:16 - say we have the first programming
01:18 - language as Java and then let's say we
01:20 - have python as the second programming
01:22 - language and then we have C++ and then
01:25 - let's say we have C over here so guys
01:27 - basically we have these four programming
01:29 - language which is inside the h2 tag let
01:32 - me just save this file now and try
01:33 - reloading this page on the browser so
01:36 - guys as you can see we have the H1 tag
01:38 - and Then followed by the H2 tags which
01:40 - are having the name of the programming
01:42 - languages over here now guys let us say
01:44 - we want to number all these programming
01:46 - languages in such a way that the first
01:49 - language is Java and then the second
01:50 - language in the list is Python and then
01:53 - we have third language as C++ and fourth
01:55 - language is C so the first option is to
01:57 - use the numbers inside the HTML code
02:00 - over here but guys we don't want to use
02:02 - that so the other option is to use the
02:04 - CSS counters over here now guys how do
02:07 - we use the CSS counter let us check that
02:10 - so inside our style. CSS file which is
02:13 - attached to this HTML file over here
02:15 - with the help of the link tag what we
02:17 - will do is first of all we will Define
02:19 - the body tag in this case and then we
02:22 - have the CSS property which is counter
02:25 - reset in this case so guys basically we
02:27 - use the counter reset see SS property in
02:31 - order to Define a variable so guys let
02:33 - us say we provide the name of the
02:35 - variable as number so guys basically
02:37 - this variable we are going to use in
02:39 - order to provide the numbers to all
02:42 - these programming languages that we have
02:44 - displayed on the UI so guys what we are
02:46 - going to do is after this we have to
02:49 - provide the tag before which we want to
02:52 - provide the number so guys basically
02:54 - what tag we have used over here in order
02:56 - to display the programming languages we
02:58 - have used the H2 tag over here so guys
03:01 - basically we will use the h2 tag and
03:03 - then we have to use the codo element
03:06 - that is before so guys two times colon
03:08 - we have to use followed by the before
03:11 - keyword in this case so guys basically
03:13 - the meaning of this is whatever content
03:16 - we provide inside the curly braces for
03:19 - this particular selector that content
03:22 - will be displayed over here before the
03:24 - content of the h2 tag in this case so
03:26 - guys what we have to do is inside this
03:29 - particular H2 tag for which we have the
03:31 - sudo element that is before we have to
03:33 - use the counter increment CSS property
03:36 - so guys basically we use this counter
03:38 - increment CSS property and we use the
03:41 - same variable that is number over here
03:43 - so simply we are going to set the
03:45 - variable that is number and then guys
03:47 - after this we have to use the content in
03:50 - this case so this is the CSS property
03:52 - that we will be using which is content
03:54 - over here which will set this particular
03:57 - number before the h2 tag which is
03:59 - playing these programming languages so
04:01 - guys over here inside the content we
04:04 - will be using the function that is
04:05 - counter in this case so guys basically
04:08 - this counter is a function which will
04:10 - take one parameter and we are going to
04:12 - pass this number as the parameter over
04:14 - here so guys this is the function that
04:16 - is counter and instead of this name we
04:18 - are going to provide number over here so
04:21 - guys basically what will happen is
04:23 - automatically the number will start from
04:25 - one and then for the second programming
04:27 - language two will be displayed and then
04:29 - we have three and then four so guys
04:31 - after providing the number we also have
04:34 - to provide certain space or the dot
04:36 - character as well so after this counter
04:38 - function we provide the space character
04:41 - followed by double codes and let's say
04:42 - we provide a DOT character and Then
04:44 - followed by space so guys after this
04:47 - space the name of the programming
04:48 - languages will be displayed over here as
04:51 - we can see in this particular web
04:53 - browser right now so guys let me just
04:55 - save this file now and try reloading
04:57 - this page once again on the browser so
04:59 - as you can see the counters are helping
05:01 - us in order to provide the numbers to
05:04 - all these programming languages and this
05:06 - is how you can provide the counters in
05:08 - the CSS in order to provide the numbers
05:11 - to the list of items based on your
05:13 - project requirements guys you can also
05:15 - change the format over here after the
05:17 - number so let's say instead of the dot
05:19 - character we can also provide hyphen
05:21 - over here so instead of the dot
05:23 - character in this case let us have a
05:25 - space character followed by hyphen and
05:27 - then the space character again so let me
05:29 - save this file now and try reloading
05:31 - this page once again on the browser so
05:33 - as you can see we have the hyphen
05:35 - character in this case instead of the
05:37 - dot character apart from this we can
05:39 - also provide this number in the square
05:41 - brackets as well so let us remove these
05:44 - formatting over here and let's say we
05:46 - provide the open square bracket first of
05:48 - all so simply inside the double codes we
05:50 - provide the open square brackets and
05:53 - then after this we have the space
05:54 - character and then we will be having the
05:56 - number and then let's say we have the
05:58 - square bracket over here here which is
06:00 - ending so we have the closing square
06:02 - bracket in this case and then let's say
06:04 - followed by the space character after
06:06 - which the programming language should be
06:08 - displayed in this case so let me just
06:10 - save this file now and try reloading
06:12 - this page once again on the browser so
06:14 - as you can see these are the numbers
06:15 - that are getting displayed over here so
06:17 - guys based on your project requirements
06:19 - and the format in which you want to
06:21 - display the numbers you can display them
06:24 - by using this counter method and
06:26 - providing the variable name that you
06:28 - have provided inside the counter reset
06:31 - now guys apart from this we can also
06:33 - have the nested counter so let us check
06:35 - the example of the nested counters in
06:37 - CSS so what we will do is let's say
06:40 - inside this h2 tag we have certain
06:43 - paragraph tags over here so simply we
06:45 - will say P tag and then we will say this
06:47 - is some test data so guys basically
06:50 - inside each programming language we will
06:53 - have certain pointers to be displayed
06:55 - and for testing purpose we are simply
06:57 - providing this test data over here so
06:59 - let's say we have these two paragraph
07:01 - over here inside the Java programming
07:04 - language and then let's say we have
07:06 - these three paragraphs inside the Python
07:08 - programming language and apart from this
07:10 - let us say we have one paragraph inside
07:12 - C++ language and two paragraphs over
07:15 - here inside the C language Let me just
07:18 - save this file now and try reloading
07:20 - this page once again on the browser so
07:22 - as you can see we have certain pointers
07:24 - over here after each programming
07:27 - languages now guys we also want to to
07:29 - number these pointers inside the
07:32 - programming languages so what we have to
07:34 - do is we need to provide another counter
07:36 - variable so guys inside the style. CSS
07:39 - first of all after the body tag what we
07:42 - will do is we want to provide the
07:44 - numbers inside these programming
07:46 - languages which are defined by using the
07:49 - h2 tag over here so simply we have to
07:52 - use the h2 tag in this case and we can
07:55 - provide the variable by using the
07:57 - counter reset and this time instead of
08:00 - providing the variable name as number we
08:02 - will say sub number over here so guys
08:04 - basically it is going to be a number
08:06 - like 1.1 or 1.2 in this case and so on
08:10 - so guys basically we use the counter
08:13 - reset CSS property once again and we
08:15 - provide the variable name as sub number
08:18 - over here and then guys what we have to
08:19 - do is we need to use the P tag followed
08:22 - by the pseudo element that is before
08:24 - that's because we are using the
08:26 - paragraph tag over here and before the
08:28 - content of this paragraph tag we want to
08:31 - display the number over here so simply
08:33 - we use the P tag followed by 2 * colon
08:36 - and then we will use the before sud sudo
08:39 - element and then guys what we have to do
08:41 - is again we have to use the counter
08:43 - increment CSS property and this time we
08:46 - will be using this sub number variable
08:49 - so let me just copy this and paste this
08:51 - over here for the counter increment CSS
08:53 - property and then after this we have to
08:56 - use the content CSS property so guys
08:59 - over here first of all we will have to
09:01 - use the number variable so that this
09:04 - particular number that is one can be
09:05 - displayed followed by Dot and the sub
09:08 - number should be displayed after that so
09:10 - basically we use the counter function
09:12 - once again over here so we say counter
09:15 - and then instead of name we will be
09:16 - using the number and then guys after
09:19 - this we want the dot character so let's
09:21 - say we provide dot character over here
09:23 - followed by space and this time we will
09:25 - be using the counter function once again
09:28 - and over here instead of of name we will
09:30 - be using sub number this time because
09:32 - that is the counter that we want to
09:34 - display for all the sub points inside
09:36 - the programming languages that we are
09:38 - displaying on the web browser so guys
09:40 - this is the sub number that we are using
09:43 - so basically this is the format the
09:45 - first number that is one will be
09:46 - displayed followed by Dot and the sub
09:48 - number that is one will be displayed so
09:50 - 1.1 will be displayed for this
09:52 - particular point over here followed by
09:54 - 1.2 for this particular point over here
09:57 - and then guys for the Python program in
09:59 - language 2.1 will be displayed followed
10:02 - by 2.1 and Then followed by 2.2 and Then
10:05 - followed by 2.3 so guys let me just save
10:08 - this file now and try reloading this
10:10 - page once again on the browser so as you
10:12 - can see we have the numbers that is 1.1
10:14 - then 1.2 and then for the points inside
10:17 - the Python programming language we have
10:19 - 2.1 2.2 2.3 and so on so guys over here
10:23 - we have missed out the space to be
10:25 - provided over here so simply we can
10:27 - provide the space character inside
10:29 - inside the double codes in this case let
10:31 - me just save this file now and try
10:32 - reloading this page once again on the
10:34 - browser so as you can see the space
10:36 - characters are now getting displayed
10:38 - over here so for the C++ programming
10:40 - language we have 3.1 as the pointer and
10:43 - then for the fourth language that is C
10:45 - we have 4.1 and Then followed by 4.2
10:48 - over here so guys in this way you can
10:50 - provide the auto numbering with the help
10:52 - of the counter method over here inside
10:55 - the CSS file in this case so guys
