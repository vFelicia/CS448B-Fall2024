00:00 - so now we will see customized tool tip
00:02 - text in CSS so guys basically a tool tip
00:05 - is often used to specify extra
00:08 - information about something when the
00:10 - user moves the mouse pointer over an
00:13 - HTML element so guys we are going to
00:15 - check with the help of examples what is
00:17 - the meaning of tool tip and how we can
00:19 - customize the tool tip text with the
00:21 - help of CSS properties now because first
00:24 - of all we will check the basic inbuilt
00:27 - tool tip that is provided by the HTML
00:30 - using the title attribute so let us move
00:32 - to the VSS code over here and simply I'm
00:34 - going to remove the previous lines of
00:36 - code inside the HTML and the CSS files
00:39 - over here now simply we are going to
00:41 - have the paragraph tag that is the P tag
00:44 - in this case and we will say get your
00:46 - mouse cursor on below text so guys we
00:48 - have a very simple statement over here
00:51 - that is get your mouse cursor on below
00:53 - text in this case and simply we are
00:55 - going to have the diff tag with the
00:57 - class that is text in this case so guys
00:59 - inside this D tag we are going to have
01:01 - the hover me text over here so that the
01:04 - user can get the mouse cursor on this
01:07 - text and basically by default we want to
01:09 - show certain tool tip so we are going to
01:12 - use the title attribute over here that
01:15 - is provided by the HTML by default so
01:17 - guys in this case we are simply going to
01:19 - provide tool tip text over here so let
01:22 - me just save this file now and try
01:24 - reloading this page once again on the
01:26 - browser as you can see we have this
01:27 - paragraph that is get your mouse cursor
01:30 - on below text over here and then when we
01:32 - get the mouse cursor on the overover me
01:34 - text as you can see the tool tip text is
01:37 - getting displayed and we can provide any
01:39 - information inside this title attribute
01:42 - to be displayed when the user gets the
01:44 - mouse cursor on this over me text or any
01:47 - other text based on your requirement now
01:50 - guys this is the default Behavior as far
01:52 - as the displaying of the tool tip is
01:54 - concerned now how do we customize this
01:56 - tool tip so basically we can use certain
01:59 - CSS proper properties in order to
02:01 - customize this tool tip over here so
02:03 - what we will do is simply I'm going to
02:05 - remove this inbu tool tip in this case
02:08 - that is the title attribute and we are
02:10 - going to have the span tag over here
02:12 - with the class name that is tool tip so
02:15 - guys basically we are going to provide
02:16 - certain CSS properties for this span tag
02:19 - as well and simply we are going to say
02:21 - the text that is tool tip text over here
02:23 - that we had defined previously inside
02:26 - the title attribute as well now guys
02:28 - inside the style. CSS file what we are
02:30 - going to do is we will provide certain
02:32 - CSS properties for this class name that
02:35 - is corresponding to the span tag over
02:37 - here so simply we are going to provide
02:39 - dot character followed by the tool tip
02:41 - and let's say we provide the background
02:43 - color as the black color over here for
02:45 - the pan tag apart from this we want to
02:48 - have the color as white color and also
02:51 - we will have the padding of five pixels
02:53 - in this case so that the tool tip is
02:55 - displayed properly when we get the mouse
02:57 - cursor on the diff tag so let me just
03:00 - save this file now and try reloading
03:02 - this page once again on the browser as
03:04 - you can see this is the tool tip text
03:06 - that will be displayed with different
03:08 - CSS properties that we have applied so
03:10 - far we can also have the Border radius
03:12 - over here so simply we will have the
03:15 - Border radius of 5 pixels so that the
03:18 - corners are rounded for this particular
03:20 - tool tip text as you can see this is the
03:22 - way that we have the rounded Corners
03:24 - over here now guys the important thing
03:26 - in this case is when the user gets the
03:29 - mouse cursor on this text that is over
03:31 - me then only the tool tip text should be
03:33 - displayed so what we can do is simply we
03:36 - will provide the visibility equal to
03:38 - Hidden in this case so this is the CSS
03:41 - property that we are going to use with
03:43 - the value that is hidden so by default
03:45 - the span tag that is having the class
03:47 - name Tool tip will be hidden on the HTML
03:50 - page let me just save this file now and
03:52 - try reloading this page as you can see
03:54 - we don't have any span tag over here and
03:56 - when we get the mouse cursor on this
03:58 - over me text we are not not able to see
04:00 - the tool tip text so in order to display
04:02 - the tool tip over here we have to
04:05 - provide the hover sudo class in this
04:07 - case so the class name that we are going
04:09 - to use is text in this case which is
04:11 - corresponding to the diff tag which is
04:13 - having the text that is over me so guys
04:15 - let me just copy this class name and
04:17 - after the dot character we will paste
04:19 - this class name and then what we have to
04:21 - do is on Hover we need to display the
04:24 - span tag that is having the tool tip
04:26 - class over here so simply we will use
04:28 - the over Pudo class in this case and
04:31 - Then followed by the class name that is
04:33 - tool tape over here so guys basically
04:35 - when the user gets the mouse cursor on
04:37 - this diff tag which is having the text
04:40 - we need to provide certain CSS
04:41 - properties for the tool tip text and in
04:44 - this case we are going to use the
04:45 - visibility it is equal to visible over
04:48 - here so guys basically from visibility
04:50 - equal to Hidden we are going to
04:52 - visibility equal to visible when the
04:55 - user gets the mouse cursor on this class
04:57 - name that is text which is corresponding
04:59 - to the diff tag that is having the text
05:02 - that is over me let me just save this
05:04 - file now and try reloading this page
05:06 - once again on the browser and now when
05:08 - we get the mouse cursor on this over me
05:10 - text as you can see we are able to see
05:12 - the tool tip text over here so guys in
05:14 - this way we can have the customized tool
05:17 - tip text over here with the help of the
05:19 - CSS properties let us get all these text
05:22 - at the center of the screen now so
05:23 - simply we are going to provide the style
05:26 - for the body tag over here so we will
05:28 - say style and then simply we can say
05:30 - text the line it is equal to Center let
05:33 - me just save this file now and try
05:34 - reloading this page as you can see when
05:36 - we get the mouse cursor on this hover me
05:38 - text the tool tip text is now getting
05:41 - displayed over here now guys currently
05:43 - the tool tip text is getting displayed
05:44 - at the right of the text we can also
05:47 - display this tool tip at the bottom of
05:49 - this hover me text over here so how we
05:51 - can do that so first of all we need to
05:53 - provide the position property for this
05:55 - class that is text over here which is
05:57 - corresponding to the diff tag so so guys
05:59 - over here we will say position it is
06:01 - equal to relative and then after this
06:04 - for this tool tip class we need to
06:06 - provide the position equal to Absolute
06:09 - over here so that we can provide the
06:11 - different CSS properties such as top
06:13 - left bottom and right so guys basically
06:16 - we will say absolute in this case and
06:18 - then after this we need to provide the
06:20 - left property as zero and then also the
06:23 - top property is 100% over here so guys
06:26 - basically what we are doing is currently
06:28 - the diff tag that that is having the
06:30 - class name text is having the position
06:32 - equal to relative and the tool tip text
06:35 - which is having the class tool tip will
06:36 - be having the position equal to Absolute
06:39 - and due to this we can use the left and
06:41 - top properties and other CSS properties
06:44 - as well as far as the positioning CSS
06:46 - properties are concerned so from left we
06:48 - are having the zero pixels and from Top
06:51 - it should be 100% so we are trying to
06:53 - get the tool tip text at the bottom of
06:56 - this text over here so let me just save
06:58 - this file now and try loading this page
07:00 - once again on the browser so now when we
07:02 - get the mouse cursor on this hover me as
07:04 - you can see the tool tip text is coming
07:07 - at the bottom of this hover me but at
07:09 - the extreme left right now so guys in
07:11 - order to correct this what we can do is
07:13 - simply we can use the display property
07:16 - and this time let's say we provide the
07:18 - display as in line over here let me just
07:20 - reload this page once again on the
07:21 - browser so as you can see the tool tip
07:24 - text is now coming at the bottom of this
07:26 - particular text let us also provide the
07:28 - width property to this tool tip text
07:30 - over here so simply we are going to
07:32 - provide the width as 130% so that the
07:35 - text can fit the box over here so let me
07:38 - just reload this page as you can see
07:40 - this is the tool tip text over here that
07:42 - can be displayed at the bottom of the
07:44 - hover me text in this case so guys in
07:46 - this way you can also provide the other
07:48 - positioning properties over here in
07:50 - order to get the tool tip text at the
07:52 - left or at the top of the overover me
07:55 - text over here now guys let us move to
07:57 - the default position that is at the
07:59 - right in this case so simply I'm going
08:01 - to remove these lines of code that is
08:03 - top and left over here so let me just
08:05 - save this file now and try reloading
08:07 - this page so now we are able to see the
08:09 - tool tip text at the right of the
08:11 - overover me text over here now guys how
08:13 - do we create an arrow for this tool tip
08:16 - text so guys let us check that as well
08:18 - so we need to use the class name that is
08:20 - tool tip and this time we are going to
08:22 - use the codo element that is after so
08:25 - guys we need to use the colon two times
08:27 - over here and then we need to use the
08:29 - after after keyword and then guys simply
08:31 - we are going to use the content which is
08:34 - going to have a space character over
08:36 - here and also we need to define the
08:37 - position as relative so in this case we
08:40 - will say position is equal to relative
08:42 - and we need to provide the Border CSS
08:45 - properties over here so let's say we
08:47 - have the border with as five pixels in
08:49 - this case apart from this the Border
08:51 - style as solid in this case so over here
08:54 - we will have the solid value and then we
08:57 - also have the Border color over here
08:59 - here so guys simply we are going to
09:01 - define the Border color as yellow for
09:03 - now we will change it to black color as
09:05 - well after positioning the Border
09:07 - properly so that we can create a arrow
09:09 - for this tool tip text so guys what we
09:11 - are going to do is let's say by default
09:13 - we are going to remove this visibility
09:15 - equal to Hidden so that we can create
09:17 - the arrow for this tool tip text first
09:19 - of all so let me just save this file now
09:21 - and try reloading this page so as you
09:23 - can see we have this border that is
09:25 - getting displayed over here right now
09:27 - now guys the border is taking the entire
09:30 - height of this particular tool tip text
09:32 - so we need to change the position value
09:34 - over here to Absolute instead of
09:36 - relative so let me just save this file
09:38 - now after providing the absolute value
09:41 - to the position and reload this page
09:43 - once again so as you can see this is a
09:45 - small square box that we have created
09:47 - now guys we need to get this border at
09:49 - the left of this tool tip text over here
09:52 - so what we can do is simply we will
09:54 - provide the left CSS property and we
09:57 - will say 0 pixels over here apart from
09:59 - this we have also provided the top CSS
10:02 - property as 50% so that from Top we have
10:05 - certain spacing over here let me just
10:07 - save this file now and try reloading
10:09 - this page once again on the browser as
10:11 - you can see the small square box has
10:13 - moved to the left right now and guys
10:15 - instead of having this yellow square box
10:18 - inside the tool tip text we want to have
10:20 - it outside of the tool tip text so
10:22 - simply we will change this left CSS
10:25 - property to right CSS property and over
10:28 - here we need to to provide the value as
10:30 - 100% which means from right it should be
10:33 - having the space of 100% that is the
10:36 - entire width of the tool tip text so let
10:38 - me just save this file now and try
10:40 - reloading this page once again on the
10:42 - browser as you can see the small square
10:44 - box has come to the left of the tool tip
10:46 - text now guys let us also provide
10:48 - certain margin at the top so we need to
10:51 - have the margin top as a negative number
10:53 - so let's say we have -5 pixels over here
10:56 - let me just save this file now and try
10:58 - reloading this page so that horizontally
11:00 - it is aligning with this particular
11:02 - hover me text over here now guys apart
11:05 - from this let us also provide the margin
11:07 - left property to the tool tip in this
11:10 - case so simply we are going to say
11:12 - margin left it is equal to 5 pixels over
11:15 - here let me just save this file now and
11:17 - try reloading this page so as you can
11:19 - see we have moved the tool tip text
11:21 - slightly to the right now guys in order
11:23 - to have the arrow shape what we want to
11:26 - do is we need to have only one side of
11:28 - the Border have the color so let us
11:31 - change the Border color to black color
11:34 - right now so instead of yellow color we
11:35 - will be able to see the black color for
11:37 - the small square box and then we need to
11:40 - only have the right color as the black
11:42 - color so guys what we have to do is the
11:45 - top color should be transparent over
11:47 - here followed by the black color which
11:49 - is at the right side of the border and
11:52 - Then followed by the transparent that is
11:53 - at the bottom and then again the
11:55 - transparent that is at the left hand
11:57 - side so let me just save this file now
12:00 - this particular line of code will help
12:01 - us in order to provide the arrow to the
12:04 - tool tip text so let us check that as
12:06 - well when we reload this page as you can
12:08 - see there is a arrow that is getting
12:10 - displayed over here for this tool tip
12:12 - text right now and then apart from this
12:14 - we can simply provide the visibility
12:17 - equal to Hidden so that when the user
12:19 - gets the mouse cursor on the diff tag
12:21 - the visibility will be changed to
12:23 - visible over here let me just reload
12:25 - this page and when we get the mouse
12:27 - cursor over here as you can see this
12:29 - this is the tool tip text that is
12:30 - getting displayed right now so guys this
12:32 - is a very simple way in order to
12:34 - customize the tool tip text apart from
12:36 - this you can also provide the fade in
12:38 - animation for the tool tip text so how
12:41 - we can do that simply we can use the
12:43 - transition CSS property so guys over
12:45 - here inside the tool tip class name we
12:48 - are going to use the transition and let
12:50 - us see whether we will be able to use it
12:52 - for the visibility CSS property or not
12:55 - we will provide the duration as 1 second
12:58 - over here let me just save this file now
13:00 - and try reloading this page so when we
13:02 - get the mouse cursor over here there is
13:04 - no fade in animation right now but guys
13:06 - when we get the mouse cursor out there
13:08 - is a 1 second delay right now so guys
13:11 - with visibility equal to Hidden and
13:13 - visibility equal to visible the
13:15 - transition will not work since the
13:17 - transition CSS property is expecting
13:20 - certain values that is 0o and one and
13:22 - the values in between as well so instead
13:25 - of having visibility we can use the
13:27 - opacity so first of all we will provide
13:30 - the opacity equal to Zer which will be
13:33 - same as visibility equal to Hidden which
13:35 - means the element will not be displayed
13:37 - on the HTML page when the opacity is set
13:40 - to zero over here and instead of having
13:42 - visibility equal to visible we will have
13:45 - the opacity equal to 1 this time so guys
13:48 - by using the opacity CSS property we
13:51 - will provide the transition CSS property
13:53 - have some values in between 0 and 1 such
13:56 - as 0.5 or 0.7 when there is a transition
14:00 - within the time span of 1 second over
14:03 - here so guys simply we are going to
14:04 - change the visibility keyword to opacity
14:07 - right now let me just save this file now
14:09 - and let us see how the fade in animation
14:11 - will be displayed for the tool tip text
14:13 - when we reload this page now when we get
14:15 - the mouse cursor over here as you can
14:17 - see there is a fade in animation and the
14:19 - Fade Out animation as well within the
14:22 - time span of 1 second over here so guys
14:24 - in this way you can provide the fade in
14:26 - animation as well for the tool tip text
14:28 - and apart from this you can also draw
14:30 - the arrow with the help of the border
14:32 - that we have just seen using different
14:34 - CSS properties so guys comment in the
