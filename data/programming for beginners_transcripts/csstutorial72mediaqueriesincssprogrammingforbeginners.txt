00:00 - so now we will see media queries in CSS
00:03 - so guys basically the at media rule
00:05 - introduced in CSS 2 made it possible to
00:08 - define the different style rules for
00:11 - different media types and this we are
00:13 - going to check with the help of examples
00:15 - as well there are different types of
00:16 - media over here as you can see the first
00:19 - type is all which is used for all media
00:21 - type devices apart from this we also
00:23 - have the print value which is used for
00:25 - the print preview mode and then the most
00:28 - commonly used that is the screen value
00:30 - which is used for the computer screens
00:32 - tablets smartphones Etc so guys
00:35 - basically we are going to check the
00:36 - examples with the screen media type over
00:39 - here and basically the important
00:41 - implementation of this media queries is
00:43 - used in such a way that when you want to
00:45 - provide different CSS properties for
00:47 - smaller screen devices such as
00:49 - smartphones or the tablets you can use
00:51 - the media queries over here which we are
00:53 - going to check with the help of examples
00:55 - now guys the commonly used media
00:57 - features are orientation then we have
01:00 - have Max height and Min height apart
01:02 - from this we also have the max width and
01:04 - Min width over here so guys let us check
01:06 - the examples of the media queries so let
01:08 - us move to the vs code over here and
01:10 - simply I'm going to remove the previous
01:12 - lines of code that we had written in the
01:14 - HTML and the CSS files in this case now
01:17 - guys what we are going to do is when we
01:18 - are going to reduce the screen width
01:20 - that is towards the tablets or towards
01:22 - the smartphone screen with we are going
01:24 - to change the background color with the
01:26 - help of the media rule over here so guys
01:29 - let us check this feature over here so
01:31 - inside the body tag we are simply going
01:33 - to have the diff tag over here and
01:35 - simply we are going to have some random
01:37 - text in this case with 10 words over
01:39 - here so guys basically this is the Mt
01:41 - abbreviation that helps us in order to
01:43 - Generate random text let me just save
01:45 - this file now and try reloading this
01:47 - page on the browser so as you can see we
01:49 - have the diff tag with the simple text
01:51 - over here now guys we are going to
01:53 - provide a different background color for
01:55 - the body tag in this case originally so
01:57 - let us have the background color CS this
02:00 - property and let's say we have the value
02:02 - as equa for the body tag over here let
02:04 - me just save this file now and try
02:06 - reloading this page as you can see we
02:08 - have the background color for the body
02:10 - tag in this case now guys let me quickly
02:12 - open the console over here so when we
02:14 - are going to increase or decrease the
02:16 - width over here in this case as you can
02:18 - see these are the numbers that is the
02:20 - width and height that are getting
02:22 - displayed over here for this particular
02:24 - screen so guys by default we have this
02:26 - particular background color that is aqua
02:29 - over here but we are going to decrease
02:31 - the screen width and let's say below 500
02:33 - pixels of the width we want to change
02:35 - the background color of the body to
02:37 - yellow color over here so we can simply
02:40 - use the media query in this case so let
02:42 - us check that as well so inside the
02:44 - style. CSS file we are going to use at
02:46 - theate character over here and simply we
02:49 - are going to use the media so guys this
02:51 - is the keyword that we are going to use
02:53 - and Then followed by the space character
02:55 - we can simply omit this particular
02:57 - option that is screen option over here
02:59 - or we can provide this value so that the
03:01 - media query is applied only to the
03:04 - computer screens tablets and smartphones
03:06 - and other types of screen so guys
03:08 - basically we are going to provide the
03:10 - value that is screen over here and then
03:12 - followed by the end keyword and then
03:15 - inside the open and close parenthesis we
03:17 - want the max width to be 500 pixels over
03:20 - here so guys below 500 pixels we want
03:23 - the background color to be updated which
03:25 - is not updating right now so currently
03:27 - it is 601 pixels that we can see so
03:30 - simply we are going to set the max width
03:33 - it is equal to 500 pixels so guys inside
03:36 - this we are going to provide the body
03:38 - tag over here for which we are going to
03:40 - set the background color as yellow color
03:42 - over here so guys what is the meaning of
03:44 - this media query so simply we are using
03:47 - the media keyword after the etherate
03:49 - character and Then followed by the media
03:51 - type that is screen over here and then
03:53 - followed by the end character and the
03:55 - meaning of this Max width is basically
03:57 - 500 pixels is the maximum value for the
04:00 - screen width over here so any screens
04:03 - that are below 500 pixels should have
04:05 - the background color as yellow for the
04:08 - body tag over here so let's say we have
04:10 - any of the smartphone in this case or
04:11 - the tablet which is having the width
04:14 - below 500 pixels for that particular
04:16 - screen the background color will be
04:18 - displayed as yellow and the screen width
04:20 - which is more than 500 pixels such as
04:22 - for the desktop computers for that
04:24 - particular device we are going to have
04:26 - the background color as Aqua so guys let
04:28 - us check this let me just save this file
04:30 - now and try reloading this page once
04:32 - again on the browser notice that
04:34 - currently we have the default value that
04:35 - is equa but when we reduce the screen
04:38 - width as you can see we have moved to
04:40 - 572 pixels over here and then we are
04:42 - reducing it towards the 500 pixels
04:45 - slowly so we are reducing it so
04:47 - currently it is
04:48 - 5.67 and when we reduce it next as you
04:51 - can see the background color is now
04:53 - updated to yellow color so guys simply
04:55 - in this way we can reduce the screen
04:57 - width and test this particular met query
05:00 - over here and whatever device is having
05:02 - the width below 500 pixels will have the
05:05 - background color as yellow for this
05:07 - particular page that is getting
05:08 - displayed and when we increase the width
05:10 - over here above 500 pixels again the
05:13 - background color is updated to aqua
05:15 - color over here so guys this is the main
05:17 - functionality of having the media
05:19 - queries it helps us in order to provide
05:22 - the certain CSS properties to different
05:25 - devices that are having different screen
05:27 - width or the screen height as well so
05:29 - guys the other parameters that we can
05:31 - use is orientation then we have the
05:33 - height as well which involves Max and
05:35 - Min height and then we also have width
05:37 - which is Max width and Min width in
05:39 - which case we are currently using the
05:41 - max width over here apart from this we
05:43 - can also have another condition over
05:45 - here so let's say we want the max width
05:47 - to be 300 pixels and Below 300 pixels we
05:51 - want some other background color so let
05:53 - me just copy these lines of code over
05:55 - here and we are going to have similar
05:57 - media query but this time we are going
05:59 - to have the max width equal to 300
06:01 - pixels in this case so whatever devices
06:04 - that are having the screen withd lesser
06:06 - than 300 pixels should have some other
06:08 - background color so let's say we have
06:10 - this chart reuse background color over
06:13 - here let me just save this file now and
06:15 - try reloading this page once again on
06:16 - the browser So currently we have the
06:18 - aqua color that is the default color
06:20 - which will be displayed on the desktop
06:22 - computers and then let's say when we
06:24 - reduce the screen width to below 500
06:26 - pixels it is having the yellow
06:28 - background color which will probably
06:30 - correspond to the tablet screen size and
06:32 - then let's say we have Max withd equal
06:34 - to 300 pixels which might correspond to
06:37 - some of the smartphone devices so let us
06:39 - say we go beyond the 300 pixels which
06:42 - means we are reducing the screen width
06:44 - to lesser than 300 pixels over here so
06:46 - as you can see we have a different
06:48 - background color over here now guys let
06:50 - us say when we move towards this
06:52 - particular width that is below 300
06:54 - pixels we want to hide this particular
06:57 - diff tag so what we can do is simply in
06:59 - inside the same media query we can have
07:01 - the diff tag that will help us in order
07:04 - to identify this particular diff tag
07:07 - inside the body tag over here and simply
07:09 - we can provide the display property
07:11 - equal to none so guys basically what
07:13 - this will do is when the screen withth
07:15 - is below 300 pixels the diff tag will be
07:18 - hidden over here let me just save this
07:20 - file now and try reloading this page as
07:22 - you can see we are below 300 pixels
07:24 - that's why we cannot see the diff tag
07:26 - over here so currently we have the
07:28 - screen width of more than 500 pixels
07:30 - over here let us reduce it to below 500
07:33 - pixels as you can see we have the yellow
07:35 - color and the diff tag is getting
07:36 - displayed now let us reduce to less than
07:39 - 300 pixels over here as far as the
07:41 - screen width is concerned so as you can
07:43 - see when we move from 305 over here to
07:46 - 298 this the background color is updated
07:49 - to the Chart reuse color and the diff
07:51 - tag is getting hidden over here so guys
07:53 - in this way we can simply use the media
07:55 - queries in order to provide the
07:57 - different CSS properties as far as as
07:59 - far as the screen width orientation or
08:01 - the height is concerned so guys comment
