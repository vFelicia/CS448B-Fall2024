00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about directory and file management in
00:05 - Python Programming so guys our directory
00:08 - is a collection of files and sub
00:10 - directories so basically a directory
00:12 - inside another directory is known as a
00:15 - subdirectory over here and python has
00:17 - the OS module that provides us with many
00:20 - useful methods to work with directories
00:23 - and files as well so this we are going
00:25 - to check with the help of examples as
00:26 - well it is very important to note that
00:29 - over here we have a very important
00:31 - module that is OS so this package we are
00:33 - going to import in the python code so
00:36 - first of all we are going to check how
00:37 - do we get the current directory in
00:39 - Python by using the get CWD method
00:43 - inside this OS module so let us move to
00:45 - the vs code over here so the very first
00:47 - thing that we have to do is we have to
00:49 - import the OS module so once we have
00:52 - imported the OS module we can simply
00:54 - print the current working directory so
00:57 - over here we have the print statement
00:58 - followed by inside the parenthesis we
01:01 - will use this OS followed by Dot and
01:04 - then we have the get CWD that is the
01:07 - method in order to get the current
01:09 - working directory over here so let me
01:11 - just save this file now and try running
01:12 - this code it will print the current
01:14 - working directory as you can see it is
01:16 - inside the C drive followed by the users
01:18 - and then we have the user folder
01:20 - followed by the python so this is the
01:22 - directory in which this particular code
01:24 - is present as you can see over here we
01:27 - can see the entire path that is users
01:29 - user and then Python and inside this
01:31 - python folder we have this file that is
01:33 - python underscore code so this is the
01:36 - very simple method in order to get the
01:38 - current working directory in Python
01:40 - programming language now let us move to
01:42 - another task now how do we change the
01:44 - directory in the python so we have
01:46 - something called as chtir this is
01:48 - another method followed by we have to
01:51 - provide the path as the parameter to
01:53 - this particular function so what we will
01:55 - do is let us say we have this particular
01:57 - directory over here I am going to copy
01:59 - this and we are going to change the
02:02 - current working directory to this
02:03 - particular directory path that we have
02:06 - just copied so what we will do is before
02:08 - this line of code which gets us the
02:10 - current working directory we will change
02:12 - the current working directory over here
02:13 - so again we are going to use the OS
02:16 - module name followed by Dot and then we
02:18 - have something called as chtir so as you
02:21 - can see this is the method that we can
02:23 - use and then inside this we have to
02:26 - provide the path of the directory to
02:28 - which we want to change the directory so
02:30 - basically I'm going to paste this and
02:32 - this is the path that we are going to
02:33 - change the directory to so let me just
02:35 - save this file now and try running this
02:37 - code so as you can see we are getting
02:39 - some error over here Unicode Escape
02:41 - codec can't decode bytes in position two
02:44 - three so what we have to do is we have
02:46 - to escape these backslashes over here so
02:48 - I am providing another backslash
02:50 - character over here on all the instances
02:52 - of the backslash characters so let me
02:55 - just save this file now and try running
02:56 - this code so as you can see after
02:58 - changing the directory I am once and in
03:00 - getting the current working directory
03:02 - over here by calling this get CWD method
03:05 - and then you can see this that is the
03:07 - entire path that we have changed the
03:09 - directory to that path is getting
03:11 - printed on the console right now so guys
03:13 - this is the way that we can easily
03:14 - change the directory to any directory
03:16 - that we want now let us move to another
03:18 - task over here how do we list the
03:20 - directories and files in Python so what
03:23 - we are going to do is let us list all
03:25 - the subdirectories and the files that
03:27 - are present in a particular directory so
03:29 - I am going to move one stage back over
03:30 - here so as you can see inside the
03:32 - languages we have dot Java and python so
03:35 - we want to list down all the
03:37 - subdirectories over here so how do we do
03:39 - that we have something called as list
03:41 - dir method that will help us in order to
03:44 - list all the directories and the files
03:45 - so over here in the vs code what I will
03:48 - do is I'll go one step behind so we are
03:50 - going to remove this python we have to
03:52 - go up to the languages part and then
03:54 - after this what we will do is we will
03:57 - simply print the directory list so over
03:59 - here here we have OS followed by Dot and
04:02 - then we have list directory so as you
04:04 - can see we have used the chdir method in
04:07 - order to change the directory and inside
04:09 - that directory I want to list all the
04:12 - subdirectories over here and this should
04:14 - be followed by the open and close
04:15 - parenthesis because this is a function
04:17 - so let me just save this file now and
04:19 - try running this code so as you can see
04:21 - we are getting dot Java and then python
04:24 - so Guys these are the subfolders that
04:26 - are present inside this directory that
04:28 - is Dart Java and python let us move one
04:30 - step behind once again over here we can
04:33 - see programming for beginners and there
04:35 - are multiple subdirectories and files as
04:37 - well so what we can do is over here I'll
04:40 - just move one step back I'll just remove
04:42 - these languages part over here and then
04:44 - let me just save this file now and try
04:45 - running this code as you can see we are
04:47 - getting all the files in subdirectories
04:49 - we have description python.txt then
04:52 - description.txt then these are the
04:54 - subdirectories without any extensions
04:56 - over here then we have thumbnails one
04:58 - thumbnails one dot PPT which is a
05:00 - PowerPoint presentation we have videos
05:02 - and then the YouTube channel as well
05:04 - which are sub directories next let us
05:06 - move to another task so over here as you
05:09 - can see making a new directory in Python
05:11 - so how we can do that by using the mktir
05:14 - method so basically this is another
05:16 - method inside the OS module so in order
05:19 - to make a new directory what we will do
05:21 - is again we will go to our original
05:23 - directory path over here I'll just copy
05:25 - this and paste this over here inside the
05:27 - code so we'll just paste this over here
05:30 - in order to change the directory and
05:32 - I'll just Escape these backslashes so we
05:35 - just need to provide another backslash
05:37 - character in order to escape them so we
05:40 - have escaped all the instances of the
05:42 - backslash characters over here so
05:44 - basically first of all we are changing
05:45 - the directory and inside this directory
05:48 - now after this folder over here that is
05:50 - python which is having just three files
05:53 - over here we are going to create a
05:54 - subdirectory so basically in our code
05:57 - what we will do is over here instead of
05:59 - print statement we have the OS followed
06:02 - by Dot and then we have m k d i r so
06:06 - this method is being suggested by the vs
06:07 - code and over here inside the
06:09 - parenthesis it is going to take the
06:11 - parameter which is going to be the name
06:13 - of the sub directory so we are going to
06:15 - provide the name as the test so let me
06:17 - just save this file now and try running
06:18 - this code
06:20 - so over here nothing is being displayed
06:22 - over here that's because we have not
06:24 - provided any of the print statements but
06:26 - over here if we come to our directory as
06:28 - you can see it has created a new sub
06:31 - directory that is test over here which
06:32 - is going to be an empty subdirectory so
06:35 - it doesn't have any directory or files
06:37 - over here so basically this is the way
06:39 - that we can create the subdirectories
06:41 - now let us move to another task over
06:43 - here how do we rename a directory or a
06:46 - file so basically we can use the rename
06:48 - method that is the rename function
06:50 - inside the OS module and provide the
06:52 - first parameter as the old name which is
06:55 - the existing name and the second
06:56 - parameter is the new name that we want
06:58 - to rename it to so let us move to the vs
07:01 - code over here what we will do is we
07:03 - have already created the directory so
07:05 - I'll just remove this line of code and
07:07 - then we will say OS followed by Dot and
07:10 - then we have something called as rename
07:11 - method so this method takes two
07:13 - parameters the first parameter is the
07:16 - name of the directory or the file that
07:17 - we want to change the name of so let us
07:19 - say I just copied this directory name
07:22 - that is test over here and then I'll
07:24 - just paste this over here so we have
07:26 - test and then let's say we want to
07:27 - rename it to test one so I'll just
07:30 - provide test one over here so this test
07:32 - should be renamed to test one and then
07:35 - as a confirmation I'll just provide the
07:37 - print statement and then we will say the
07:40 - name
07:41 - successful and then let me just save
07:44 - this file now and try running this code
07:46 - as you can see rename successfully is
07:48 - already printed over here if we go to
07:50 - our directory as you can see test one is
07:52 - being displayed over here so the
07:54 - directory name which was named as test
07:56 - previously has been renamed to test one
07:59 - over here so guys this is the way that
08:00 - we can rename a particular directory in
08:03 - the same way we can rename the file
08:05 - names as well now let us move to another
08:06 - task over here how do we remove a
08:09 - directory or a file in Python so we can
08:11 - simply use the rmdir method in order to
08:14 - remove the directory and remove method
08:17 - in order to remove the file name so this
08:19 - method that is remove in order to delete
08:21 - the file I'll leave it up to you as a
08:23 - homework for you so that you can
08:24 - practice on your own and comment in the
08:26 - comment section below whether you were
08:28 - successfully able to delete the file in
08:30 - this example we are going to remove the
08:32 - directory that we have just created so
08:34 - we are going to remove this test One
08:36 - Directory so what we have to do is I'll
08:38 - just remove this line of code and then
08:40 - we will say oh is followed by Dot and
08:43 - then we have rmdir method and then
08:46 - inside this it takes the parameter as
08:48 - the name of the subdirectory that we
08:50 - want to remove so we will say test one
08:53 - over here and then as a confirmation we
08:55 - will say delete successful so let me
08:58 - just save this file now and try running
08:59 - this code as you can see delete
09:01 - successful is printed and when we move
09:03 - to the directory as you can see the test
09:05 - one directory that we had created is no
09:07 - longer existing right now so basically
09:09 - we have successfully deleted the
09:11 - directory in the same way you can delete
09:13 - the files as well by using the remove
09:15 - method which is the homework for you so
09:17 - guys practice on your own sources on
09:19 - different inputs you get different
09:20 - outputs we have seen a lot of functions
09:22 - that is present inside the OS module
09:24 - apart from this you can also provide the
09:27 - OS module over here followed by Dot and
09:30 - you can see there are many other methods
09:31 - that we have not covered but you can
09:33 - practice on your own so that based on
09:35 - your requirements you can use them in
09:37 - order to accomplish your task so guys
09:39 - that's it in this video please make sure
09:40 - that you like this video so that it
09:42 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
09:44 - this channel so that you get the
09:45 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
