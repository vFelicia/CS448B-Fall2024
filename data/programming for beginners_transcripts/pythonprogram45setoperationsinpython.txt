00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to illustrate different
00:06 - set operations so guys python offers a
00:08 - data type called set whose elements must
00:11 - be unique so we cannot have duplicate
00:13 - elements inside the set data type in the
00:16 - Python programming language now it can
00:18 - be used to perform different set
00:20 - operations such as the union of the two
00:23 - sets then we have intersection
00:24 - difference and then symmetric difference
00:26 - so guys all these set operations we are
00:29 - going to check with the examples as well
00:30 - so as you can see these are the certain
00:32 - operators that will be used in order to
00:35 - carry out the set operations the union
00:37 - operation help us in order to get all
00:40 - the elements inside both the sets so as
00:43 - you can see this is the or operator that
00:45 - we can use as the union operator and we
00:47 - have the intersection operator as well
00:49 - which uses the Ampersand operator over
00:51 - here the difference operator as well
00:53 - which uses the hyphen operator over here
00:56 - and then the symmetric difference
00:57 - operation as well which uses this Ray H2
01:00 - operator so guys let us check this with
01:02 - the help of example as well over here in
01:04 - the vs code so what we will be doing is
01:06 - we will Define the two sets over here
01:08 - the very first set will be the even
01:10 - numbers so over here we will have the
01:12 - even as the variable name followed by
01:14 - equal to and the way that we Define the
01:16 - elements inside the set is by using the
01:19 - open and close curly braces so over here
01:22 - this defines the set so what are the
01:24 - even numbers we will start from 0 and
01:26 - then we have to 4 6 and then eight so
01:29 - guys five number of elements we are
01:31 - going to have inside the one set and
01:33 - then let's say the second set we have
01:35 - the natural numbers over here which
01:37 - starts from 1 up to five so again we
01:40 - will have open and close curly braces
01:42 - and then one two three four five so Guys
01:45 - these are the two sets that we have
01:46 - defined on the other hand if you want to
01:49 - define the list we use the open and
01:51 - close square brackets but in order to
01:53 - define the sets we use the open and
01:55 - close curly braces over here and that is
01:57 - the difference between sets and list now
01:59 - guys simply we can have all these four
02:01 - operations being printed over here so
02:03 - what we will do is simply we will have
02:05 - the print statement and then we will say
02:08 - Union in this case followed by colon and
02:11 - then what we can do is we can use the
02:13 - first variable that is E1 followed by
02:15 - this or operator and then the name of
02:18 - the second set that is natural over here
02:21 - so guys this will help us in order to
02:23 - find the union of these two sets which
02:25 - will have all the numbers that are
02:27 - present inside both the sets and it will
02:30 - not repeat which means let's say this
02:32 - number 2 is common in both the sets but
02:35 - it will be displayed only once while
02:37 - printing this particular statement and
02:39 - that is the meaning of union having all
02:42 - the elements that are present in both
02:43 - the sets over here now similarly we will
02:45 - have the other operations as well so
02:47 - I'll simply copy and paste this line of
02:49 - code multiple number of times so over
02:52 - here we will have intersection so we
02:54 - will say intersection in this case and
02:57 - then we will have the difference as well
02:59 - so I'll just copy this from here and
03:01 - paste this over here instead of Union
03:03 - and then we also have symmetric
03:05 - difference over here so I'll simply copy
03:07 - this and paste this over here now guys
03:10 - the only change that we have to do is we
03:12 - need to change the operators so for
03:14 - intersection we need to use the
03:16 - Ampersand over here so even Ampersand
03:18 - and the natural and then for difference
03:21 - we need to do even minus natural so in
03:24 - the case of intersection operation
03:26 - whatever elements are common in both the
03:28 - sets those elements will be displayed
03:31 - for the difference part only the
03:33 - elements that are present in the A1 but
03:35 - not present in the natural set will be
03:38 - displayed for this even minus natural
03:40 - statement over here and then for the
03:42 - symmetric difference the common elements
03:44 - in both the sets will not be included
03:46 - but all the other elements will be
03:48 - included over here so over here in this
03:50 - case for the symmetric difference we
03:52 - need to use the Rays to operator over
03:54 - here so A1 raised to Natural so Guys
03:57 - these are certain set operations which
03:59 - are very basic so guys let me just save
04:01 - this file now and try running this code
04:03 - so as you can see we have got the union
04:05 - it is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then eight so
04:10 - basically all the elements that are
04:11 - present in both the sets are being
04:13 - displayed but there are no duplicates
04:14 - over here all the unique elements are
04:16 - being displayed and then in the
04:18 - intersection only the common elements
04:20 - are being displayed which is two and
04:22 - then 4 in this case so 2 and 4 is being
04:24 - displayed the difference means all the
04:27 - elements that are present in the A1 but
04:28 - not in natural so over here we have 0
04:31 - and Then followed by 6 and then eight so
04:34 - these are the certain elements that are
04:35 - present in the difference operation and
04:38 - then in the symmetric we have 0 1 3 5 6
04:41 - and then eight so basically whatever
04:43 - common numbers that are present that is
04:45 - 2 and 4 will not be displayed for the
04:47 - symmetric difference operation over here
04:49 - so Guys these are certain set operations
04:51 - that you can carry out while performing
04:53 - the requirements of your project so
04:55 - please make sure that you practice on
04:57 - your own so that on different inputs you
04:58 - get different outputs make sure that you
05:01 - like this video so that it reaches to
05:02 - more people and so subscribe to this
05:04 - channel so that you get the
05:05 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
05:07 - the next video that we are going to talk
05:09 - about is Python program to count the
