00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to generate a random
00:06 - number so guys we can easily use the
00:08 - random module that is inside the Python
00:10 - programming language which will help us
00:12 - to generate a random number in the
00:14 - Python programming language so let us
00:16 - understand this with the help of example
00:18 - now so over here in the vs code the very
00:21 - first thing that we have to do is we
00:22 - have to import the module That Is Random
00:25 - so we use the keyword import followed by
00:28 - space and then we have the library That
00:30 - Is Random over here so this random
00:32 - library is responsible in order to
00:35 - generate the random numbers in the
00:37 - Python program so next time what we can
00:39 - do is we can simply use this random
00:42 - module over here followed by Dot and
00:44 - then we have another function called
00:46 - Rand end so as you can see when we start
00:48 - typing over here you're getting this
00:51 - Rand end function which can be very much
00:53 - helpful in order to generate the random
00:55 - integers so when we use this this Rand
00:58 - in function is expect getting two
01:00 - parameters over here the first parameter
01:02 - is the minimum value and the second
01:04 - parameter is the maximum value so let's
01:06 - say we want to generate the random
01:08 - numbers between 1 to 10 so over here we
01:11 - will provide the minimum value as 1 and
01:13 - maximum value as 10 over here both these
01:16 - numbers are separated by a comma so as
01:18 - you can see we have a comma over here in
01:20 - between now what this will do is it will
01:22 - generate a random integer and then we
01:24 - can simply assign it to the variable
01:26 - that is number over here so we simply
01:29 - say number so this is the variable in
01:31 - which the random integer will be
01:33 - generated now what we can do is simply
01:35 - we can print this random numbers over
01:37 - here with this label we will say random
01:40 - number generated
01:44 - and Then followed by colon and then we
01:47 - can simply have numbers over here open
01:49 - and close curly braces we will use the
01:51 - dot format function over here in order
01:53 - to print the number so we have dot
01:55 - format and inside this format we can
01:58 - simply provide number over here so
02:00 - basically this is going to print random
02:02 - number generated and then the value of
02:04 - that integer which is generated by this
02:07 - statement over here so let me just save
02:09 - this file now and try running this code
02:11 - so as you can see random number
02:13 - generated and then we are getting 4 in
02:15 - this case if we run this code once again
02:17 - we should get a different number as you
02:19 - can see we are getting 7 now we'll run
02:21 - this code once again we are getting 7
02:22 - again and then we are getting 3 and then
02:25 - one and then seven and then six and so
02:28 - on so any number you want to generate
02:30 - between any range you can get it by
02:32 - using this Rand end inside the random
02:35 - module now guys it becomes very
02:37 - important when you are developing an
02:38 - application that needs throwing of a
02:41 - dice which will involve only the numbers
02:43 - between one to six so what we can do is
02:45 - over here we can simply say ties as the
02:48 - variable name and then the random
02:50 - integers that will be generated should
02:52 - be between 1 to 6 over here minimum
02:55 - value will be 1 followed by comma and
02:57 - then we have the maximum value as 6 in
02:59 - this case and then we can simply change
03:01 - this label as number on dice over here
03:04 - number on ties and Then followed by open
03:07 - and close curly braces over here we need
03:10 - to change the variable name so instead
03:12 - of number we will say dice in this case
03:13 - so guys when you have the application
03:15 - that is related to throwing of a dice we
03:18 - can have this random module help us in
03:20 - order to generate the numbers between
03:22 - one to six so let me just save this file
03:24 - now and try running this code once again
03:26 - so as you can see number of ties it is
03:28 - coming as 4 and then once again when we
03:30 - run this we are getting 3 now and then
03:33 - one and then one again and then we are
03:35 - getting 6 and so on we can successfully
03:37 - use the random module in order to
03:40 - accomplish our task so guys basically
03:42 - this is one of the ways in which you can
03:44 - generate the random numbers in the
03:45 - Python programming language apart from
03:47 - this this random module is also having
03:50 - many other functions that we can use
03:52 - based on our requirements so as you can
03:53 - see once we provide the random module
03:55 - followed by dot vs code is suggesting us
03:58 - many other functions that can be used
04:00 - based on a requirements so guys practice
04:03 - on your own so that on different inputs
04:05 - you get different outputs please make
04:06 - sure that you like this video so that it
04:08 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
04:10 - this channel so that you get the
04:12 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
04:14 - the next video that we are going to talk
04:15 - about is Python program to convert
04:18 - kilometers to miles so stay tuned
