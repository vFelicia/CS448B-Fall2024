00:00 - so now we will see pseudo elements in
00:02 - CSS so guys basically a CSS Pudo element
00:06 - is used to style specified parts of an
00:09 - element and this we are going to check
00:11 - with the help of examples as well so for
00:13 - example the seudo elements can be used
00:16 - to style the first letter or the first
00:19 - line of an HTML element or also it can
00:22 - be used in order to insert the content
00:25 - before or after the content of an
00:27 - element so guys some of the example
00:30 - include we have something called as
00:32 - first line over here which is one of the
00:34 - pseudo elements now guys it is very
00:36 - important to note that whenever you are
00:38 - using the pseudo elements in the style.
00:41 - CSS file we need to have two times colon
00:44 - over here followed by the Pudo element
00:46 - that we are going to use so guys let us
00:48 - check this with the help of example in
00:50 - vs code over here so simply I'm going to
00:53 - remove the previous lines of code that
00:54 - we had written in the HTML and the CSS
00:57 - files over here now guys we are going to
01:00 - have a diff tag in this case so simply
01:02 - we are going to have the div tag and we
01:05 - are going to Define some random text
01:07 - over here so simply we are going to have
01:10 - the lurm M abbreviation over here that
01:12 - can help us in order to generate the
01:14 - random text in this case now guys let me
01:16 - just save this file now and try
01:18 - reloading this page once again on the
01:20 - browser so as you can see we have
01:22 - certain random text that is getting
01:24 - generated on the web browser now guys
01:26 - let us say we want this particular first
01:29 - line of this diff tag to be colored as
01:32 - red color over here so how do we do that
01:35 - so basically we can simply use the sudo
01:38 - element that is the first line in this
01:40 - case inside the CSS file in order to
01:43 - have the text color as red so guys let
01:45 - us move to the CSS file over here and
01:48 - inside the CSS file simply we are going
01:50 - to define the div tag in this case and
01:53 - then as I have told you we have to use
01:55 - two times colon over here and then
01:58 - followed by the sudo element that is
02:00 - first line in this case so guys
02:02 - basically we are going to use the first
02:04 - line Pudo element and then we need to
02:07 - have the open and close curly braces
02:10 - inside which we are going to define the
02:12 - CSS properties so guys in this case
02:14 - simply we are going to use the color CSS
02:16 - property and simply we are going to set
02:18 - the text color as red color over here so
02:21 - guys let me just save this file now and
02:23 - try reloading this page once again on
02:25 - the browser so as you can see the first
02:27 - line of this particular diff tag which
02:30 - is having four lines over here is now
02:32 - having the text color as red color in
02:34 - this case guys we can have other CSS
02:37 - properties as well being defined over
02:39 - here so let's say we want the text size
02:42 - to be larger so in this case simply we
02:44 - are going to use the font size CSS
02:47 - property and simply we will say large
02:49 - value in this case so let me just save
02:51 - this file now and try reloading this
02:53 - page once again on the browser so as you
02:55 - can see the font size is increased to
02:57 - some extent now let us use some other
03:00 - value that is larger in this case so
03:02 - that we can see the font size of the
03:04 - first line clearly larger compared to
03:07 - the other lines of this particular diff
03:09 - tag over here so guys let me just reload
03:12 - this page once again on the browser so
03:14 - as you can see the font size is larger
03:16 - now compared to the font size of the
03:18 - other lines of the same diff tag in this
03:20 - case now guys apart from this we can
03:22 - also use the first letter Udo element so
03:25 - let's say instead of having the red
03:27 - color for this first letter we want this
03:29 - first first letter to be displayed in
03:31 - some other color so guys what we can do
03:33 - is simply inside the style. CSS file
03:35 - over here again we are going to define
03:37 - the diff tag and then after this we are
03:40 - going to provide two times colon and
03:42 - then simply we can say first letter Pudo
03:45 - element so guys basically we use the
03:47 - first letter sudo element in order to
03:50 - define the CSS property for the first
03:52 - letter of this particular HTML element
03:55 - over here so guys inside this what we
03:57 - are going to do is let's say we want a
03:59 - different color so the color that we are
04:01 - going to use is blue in this case so
04:04 - guys we have set the color as blue and
04:06 - let's say we want the font size to be
04:08 - larger over here so simply we are going
04:10 - to define the font size as 32 pixels in
04:13 - this case so guys let me just save this
04:15 - file now and try reloading this page
04:17 - once again on the browser so as you can
04:19 - see the color of the first letter of
04:21 - this particular diff tag has been
04:23 - updated to the blue color now and also
04:26 - the font size of this first letter is 32
04:29 - pixel in this case just like how we have
04:31 - defined over here inside the style. CSS
04:34 - file so guys basically this first
04:36 - letters Udo element can help you in
04:39 - order to provide certain CSS properties
04:42 - to this particular first letter of this
04:44 - HTML element based on your project
04:46 - requirements now guys apart from this we
04:49 - also have something called as before
04:51 - pseudo element so guys let us check this
04:53 - as well so what we are going to do is
04:55 - before this diff tag we are going to
04:57 - have a heading over here which is going
05:00 - to be the H1 heading so we will say this
05:03 - is heading one in this case so guys let
05:06 - me just save this file now and try
05:07 - reloading this page once again on the
05:09 - browser so as you can see we have the
05:11 - heading and it is having its default
05:13 - font size over here now guys let us say
05:16 - we want some icon to be displayed before
05:19 - this particular heading so what we can
05:20 - do is simply we can use the before sudo
05:24 - element in order to display a particular
05:26 - icon or Emoji before the HTML element so
05:30 - guys let us check that as well how it
05:32 - can be done so basically inside the
05:34 - style. CSS file over here simply we are
05:36 - going to define the H1 tag in this case
05:39 - and Then followed by two * colon and
05:41 - then we have something called as before
05:43 - so as you can see this is the sudo
05:45 - element that we will be using and then
05:48 - guys inside this what we can do is
05:50 - simply we are going to have the content
05:52 - CSS property and we are going to say URL
05:56 - and inside this URL we are going to
05:58 - provide the name of of the Emoji that we
06:00 - want to display before the heading so
06:03 - guys over here I have downloaded a
06:05 - smiley emoji over here so we are going
06:07 - to use the same smiley emoji in this
06:10 - case so basically we are going to
06:11 - provide the name of this PNG file that
06:14 - is smiley. PNG so guys since we are
06:17 - using the before pseudo element the
06:19 - smiley emoji will be displayed before
06:22 - the heading over here so guys let me
06:24 - just save this file now that is the
06:26 - style. CSS file and let me just reload
06:29 - this page once again on the browser so
06:31 - as you can see this is the smiley emoji
06:34 - that is getting displayed just before
06:36 - the heading that we have defined over
06:38 - here now guys in order to display this
06:40 - Emoji after the heading over here that
06:42 - is this is heading one so what we can do
06:45 - is simply instead of using the before
06:47 - pseudo element we can use the after Pudo
06:50 - element so guys what we can do is simply
06:53 - inside the style. CSS file over here
06:55 - instead of having before we will have
06:57 - after in this case so let me just save
07:00 - this file now and try reloading this
07:02 - page once again on the browser so as you
07:04 - can see now the Emoji is getting
07:06 - displayed after the heading over here
07:09 - just by using the after Pudo element in
07:12 - this case so guys in this way we can use
07:14 - the different Pudo elements based on our
07:16 - requirements now guys apart from this we
07:18 - have something called as marker pseudo
07:20 - element as well which is used in order
07:22 - to define the CSS properties for the
07:25 - unordered list or the ordered list
07:28 - markers that are the number or the
07:30 - bullet points so guys this marker Pudo
07:32 - element I'll leave up to you as a
07:34 - homework for you so that you can
07:35 - practice on your own as far as the list
07:38 - items are concerned so guys comment in
