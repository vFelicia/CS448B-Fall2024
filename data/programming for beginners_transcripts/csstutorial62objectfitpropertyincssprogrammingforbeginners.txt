00:00 - so now we will see object fit property
00:02 - in CSS so guys basically the CSS object
00:05 - fit property is used to specify how an
00:08 - image or the video should be resized to
00:11 - fit its container and this we are going
00:14 - to check with the help of examples as
00:15 - well we are going to see how we can set
00:18 - the image fit property for the IMG tag
00:20 - over here so guys there are various
00:22 - values for the object fit property in
00:24 - CSS the default value for the object fit
00:27 - is f the image is resized to feel the
00:30 - the given Dimension over here and if
00:32 - necessary the image will be stretched or
00:34 - squeed to fit so guys let us check this
00:36 - with the help of example in vs code over
00:38 - here we will remove the previous lines
00:40 - of code that we had written in the HTML
00:43 - and the CSS files in this case and then
00:45 - simply we are going to have the dev with
00:48 - the class container over here now guys
00:50 - inside this container we are going to
00:52 - set the IMG tag in this case and we are
00:54 - going to take the sample image that is
00:56 - already present in our directory where
00:58 - we have saved the HTML and the CSS files
01:01 - over here now guys apart from this we
01:03 - will also set the alt attribute as test
01:05 - image in this case let me just save this
01:07 - file now and apart from this we will
01:09 - also set the style for the IMG tag so
01:12 - that we can set the width and height
01:14 - properties for the image so guys let us
01:16 - say we have 300 pixels as width in this
01:19 - case and 200 pixels as height for the
01:21 - EMG so guys let me just set the width
01:23 - and height over here let me just save
01:25 - this file now and try reloading this
01:27 - page on the browser so as you can see
01:29 - this is this is the image that is
01:30 - getting displayed over here now guys
01:32 - since the image is present inside the
01:34 - container let us provide certain
01:36 - background color for the container as
01:38 - well apart from the padding property so
01:40 - what we will do is for the diff tag that
01:43 - is having the class container over here
01:45 - we will set certain CSS properties so
01:47 - guys let me just copy this class name
01:49 - over here so we use the dot character
01:51 - followed by the class name and then what
01:54 - we will do is we will have the
01:55 - background color as yellow color over
01:57 - here and then apart from this since the
01:59 - display value is block by default for
02:02 - the diff container we are going to set
02:04 - the display as inline over here and then
02:07 - apart from this we will also set the
02:09 - padding as 20 pixels so Guys these CSS
02:12 - properties will help us in order to see
02:14 - the background color of the container as
02:16 - yellow apart from the image that is
02:18 - already present inside this container so
02:21 - let me just save this file now and try
02:23 - reloading this page once again on the
02:25 - browser so as you can see we are getting
02:27 - some background color for this
02:28 - particular diff tag as well now guys
02:30 - instead of setting the display as inline
02:33 - we will set it as inline block over here
02:35 - let me just save this file now and try
02:37 - reloading this page once again on the
02:39 - browser so as you can see we have some
02:41 - kind of spacing over here after the
02:43 - image because of the padding property
02:45 - that we have already set to 20 pixels in
02:47 - this case now guys we will see the
02:49 - different values of the object fit
02:51 - property while we are setting it to the
02:53 - IMG tag over here so let us move to the
02:55 - style. CSS file in this case and then we
02:58 - are going to set the object object fit
03:00 - CSS property S field over here which is
03:02 - the default value in this case let me
03:05 - just save this file now and try
03:06 - reloading this page once again on the
03:08 - browser you will notice that there is no
03:10 - change right now that's because this is
03:12 - the default value of the object fit CSS
03:15 - property now guys apart from this we
03:17 - have the second value that is cover in
03:20 - which case the image keeps its aspect
03:22 - ratio and Fs the given Dimension the
03:25 - image will be clipped to fit over here
03:27 - so guys let us check this as well so
03:29 - inside the style. CSS file we will set
03:32 - the value as cover over here and let us
03:34 - see what will be the changes on the
03:36 - image so let me just save this file now
03:38 - and try reloading this page once again
03:40 - on the browser so as you can see there
03:42 - is no change right now that's because
03:44 - the width and height of this image has
03:46 - been set in such a way that the cover
03:48 - value will not make any changes over
03:50 - here so guys what we will do is let us
03:52 - decrease the width of this particular
03:54 - image to 200 pixels over here let me
03:57 - just save this file now and try
03:58 - reloading this page once again on the
04:00 - browser so as you can see the cover
04:02 - value of the object to fit CSS property
04:05 - is helping us in order to scale the
04:07 - image in such a way that the entire
04:09 - image can be seen within the width and
04:11 - height that we have already set now guys
04:13 - apart from this we also have something
04:15 - called as contain in which case the
04:17 - image keeps its aspect ratio but is
04:20 - resized to fit within the given
04:22 - Dimension so guys let us check this as
04:24 - well so what will happen when we set the
04:26 - value as contain over here let me just
04:28 - save this file now and try reloading
04:30 - this page once again on the browser if
04:32 - you notice the entire image is getting
04:35 - displayed over here the entire width has
04:37 - been taken up by the image but the
04:39 - height of the image is reduced so guys
04:41 - what will happen is the original image
04:43 - is getting displayed over here to the
04:45 - max width or the max height in such a
04:48 - way that no information should be lost
04:50 - while displaying the image so guys you
04:52 - can use this particular value that is
04:54 - contained for the object fit apart from
04:56 - this we have the next value that is none
04:59 - in which case the image is not resized
05:01 - over here so guys let us check that as
05:03 - well what will happen over here when we
05:05 - set it as none so when we set the value
05:07 - as none let me just save this file now
05:09 - and try reloading this page once again
05:11 - on the browser as you can see the image
05:14 - is of original size and then within this
05:16 - particular width and height the specific
05:18 - region of the image is getting displayed
05:21 - so guys in this way the none value works
05:23 - for the object fit over here and then
05:25 - apart from this we have the last value
05:27 - that is scal down the image is scaled
05:29 - down to the smallest version of none or
05:32 - contain so guys either the none value or
05:34 - the contain value will be used when we
05:36 - use the scal down values so let us check
05:39 - this as well so over here we can set it
05:41 - to scale down in this case let me just
05:43 - save this file now and try reloading
05:45 - this page once again on the browser so
05:47 - as you can see the contain value is
05:49 - getting used over here and the entire
05:51 - image is getting displayed for the width
05:53 - and height that we have already set now
05:56 - guys in this case the width has been 200
05:58 - pixels but the height that is is being
05:59 - used over here is less compared to 200
06:02 - pixels that we have used since the
06:04 - entire image is getting displayed over
06:06 - here without any loss of information so
06:09 - guys in this way you can use the
06:10 - different values of the object fit CSS
06:13 - properties based on your requirements so
