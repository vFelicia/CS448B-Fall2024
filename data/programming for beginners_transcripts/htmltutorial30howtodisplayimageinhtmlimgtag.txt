00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to learn about displaying images
00:04 - in HTML using the IMG tag so guys
00:08 - basically the HTML IMG tag is used to
00:11 - embed an image in a web page so we can
00:15 - easily embed the images in our web pages
00:18 - based on our requirements now guys
00:20 - images are not technically inserted into
00:22 - a web page whereas images are simply
00:25 - linked to the web pages so how we can
00:28 - link the images to the web page we will
00:30 - see that but technically we don't
00:32 - actually insert the image over here on
00:35 - the web page but those images are linked
00:38 - and they are present or they are stored
00:40 - in some another location and we just
00:42 - provide the link to that path where they
00:45 - are stored now guys the IMG tag creates
00:48 - a holding space for the referenced image
00:50 - and that is how the images are displayed
00:53 - now the IMG tag is empty it contains
00:56 - attributes only and does not have a
00:58 - closing tag so so basically we are not
01:01 - going to have any content in between the
01:03 - starting and the ending tag and it is
01:05 - going to be a single tag that is the IMG
01:08 - tag along with the forward slash and
01:11 - this forward slash will be optional and
01:13 - there will be no specifically closing
01:15 - tag for this particular IMG tag over
01:17 - here now guys the IMG tag has two
01:20 - required attributes one is the SRC which
01:23 - specifies the path of the image so as
01:25 - I've told you we need to provide the
01:28 - location or the path of the image where
01:30 - the image is stored and then we also
01:32 - have the alt attribute which specifies
01:34 - an alternate text for the image so guys
01:37 - we will check both of these with the
01:38 - help of examples now in the vs code so
01:41 - let's say over here we have a normal
01:43 - paragraph So using the P tag we will say
01:45 - there is an image after this paragraph
01:48 - So guys we have provided a very simple
01:50 - statement inside the paragraph there is
01:53 - an image after this paragraph and then
01:55 - guys we can simply provide the IMG tag
01:58 - in order to display the image so let's
02:00 - say we have the less than symbol and
02:02 - then we use the IMG tag over here you
02:05 - can see an IMG element represents an
02:08 - image so this is the description that is
02:10 - provided by the vs code and then we can
02:13 - close the tag so over here we don't have
02:15 - the specific closing tag we can provide
02:18 - the forward slash at the end before the
02:20 - greater than symbol and this is optional
02:23 - in order to mark that this tag is closed
02:25 - for now and then guys what we can do is
02:28 - it doesn't have any content between the
02:30 - starting and the ending tag so we can
02:32 - only Define the attributes now how do we
02:35 - provide the link to the image so let's
02:38 - say we have certain images over here and
02:40 - we want to display this particular image
02:43 - so these are the thumbnails of the
02:44 - videos that I have created for you on my
02:46 - YouTube channel that is programming for
02:48 - beginners which you should definitely
02:50 - subscribe if you have not done so so
02:52 - over here we have this image so we will
02:55 - check what is the entire path over here
02:57 - so as you can see we have this entire
02:59 - path over here so I'll just copy this
03:01 - entire path and inside the VSS code we
03:04 - need to use the SRC attribute so guys
03:07 - over here when we type SRC you can see
03:10 - that this is the image URL this
03:12 - attribute is mandatory for the IMG
03:14 - element because we Define like where is
03:17 - this image coming from in the SRC
03:20 - attribute so over here we are going to
03:22 - use this SRC attribute followed by equal
03:25 - to character and then we have the double
03:27 - codes now guys inside the double codes
03:29 - we are going to Pro the entire directory
03:31 - path where the image is present so over
03:33 - here we have pasted the directory path
03:36 - and then after this we again have a back
03:38 - slash character and then guys we need to
03:40 - provide the name of the file as well so
03:43 - as you can see this is the name of the
03:44 - file so I'll just copy this and paste it
03:47 - over here so we have pasted this and
03:49 - guys another important thing is after
03:52 - the name of the file we need to provide
03:54 - the extension of the file as well so
03:56 - some extensions can be PNG and then
03:59 - others can jpg or any other format that
04:02 - you are using for that particular image
04:04 - so in this case it is a PNG file so we
04:06 - are going to provide PNG in the end
04:09 - after the name of the file over here
04:12 - that is the image so guys this is the
04:14 - source attribute that we have defined
04:16 - now let me just save this file now and
04:18 - try reloading this page once again on
04:20 - the browser so as you can see we are
04:22 - getting there is an image after this
04:24 - paragraph and this image it seems to be
04:26 - very large that's because increased the
04:28 - zoom Factor of this browser what if I
04:31 - get the zoom factor to 100% so guys this
04:34 - is the way that the image is being
04:35 - displayed over here but I'll change this
04:37 - Zoom to 150% so that you can clearly see
04:41 - what are the contents of this web page
04:43 - now guys we want to display this image
04:45 - little bit smaller so that it looks
04:47 - decent over here so what we will do is
04:49 - we can also use the width and height
04:52 - attributes of this image so we can get
04:54 - the cursor on the other line and then we
04:56 - can again have the width attribute so
04:59 - guys inside the width attribute we can
05:01 - say display only 40% of this image so we
05:04 - will say 40% of WID and let's say height
05:08 - we want to display only
05:10 - 25% so guys after providing the width
05:13 - and height attributes as well let me
05:15 - just save this file now and try
05:16 - reloading this page so as you can see
05:19 - now we can properly see the image that
05:21 - is being displayed over here on the web
05:23 - page so basically it is taking only the
05:25 - 40% of the entire width of the screen
05:28 - and height is being taken as the 25% of
05:31 - the height of the screen and that is how
05:34 - it is being displayed over here if we
05:36 - change the width to 50% so basically the
05:39 - image will take the 50% width of the
05:42 - entire screen so let me just save this
05:45 - file now and try reloading this page as
05:47 - you can see the right hand side of the
05:49 - image is coming at the exact middle of
05:52 - this screen right now and guys that is
05:54 - how we can mention the width and height
05:56 - of the image we can also use pixels as
05:58 - well so let's say say we provide 100
06:00 - pixels for the width and then for height
06:03 - let's say we provide 70 pixels in this
06:05 - case so we provide 70 PX note that there
06:08 - is no space character after these
06:10 - numbers and in between the PX keyword so
06:13 - let me just save this file now and try
06:15 - reloading this page as you can see the
06:17 - image is being adjusted now based on the
06:20 - numbers of the width and height that we
06:22 - have specified guys we will change it
06:24 - back to the 40% and 25% over here since
06:28 - that was looking more decent so after
06:29 - changing let me just save this file now
06:31 - and try reloading this page so as you
06:33 - can see the image is being displayed
06:35 - properly now now guys there is another
06:37 - important attribute that is the alt
06:39 - attribute that you must specify now it
06:42 - specifies the alternate text for the
06:44 - image in some cases what happens is
06:47 - let's say if the image is not present in
06:49 - this particular directory that you have
06:51 - mentioned or if you are using the URL
06:53 - then let's say if the URL is down for
06:56 - some time then that particular image
06:58 - will not be displayed properly on the
07:00 - web page now how it will be displayed
07:02 - let me just show you so what if we just
07:04 - remove the extension of this file that
07:07 - is do PNG we have removed and let us see
07:09 - how the image will be displayed on the
07:12 - web page now so let me just save this
07:14 - file now and try reloading this page so
07:16 - as you can see the image is not being
07:18 - displayed right now so guys when this
07:20 - particular thing happens it becomes very
07:22 - important that we have the alt attribute
07:25 - so that some kind of text is being
07:27 - displayed when this condition URS so we
07:30 - can come to VSS code and then over here
07:32 - after the height attribute we can
07:34 - provide the alt attribute as well as you
07:36 - can see this attribute defines an
07:39 - alternative text description of the
07:41 - image so we will use this alt attribute
07:44 - and over here we will say image
07:47 - displayed for test purpose so guys over
07:51 - here we are simply providing a text
07:53 - message that is image displayed for test
07:56 - purpose you can have any other string
07:58 - based on your requirements when such
07:59 - conditions occur now let me just save
08:02 - this file now and try reloading this
08:03 - page to see what happens so as you can
08:06 - see even though image is not being
08:08 - displayed but it is saying image
08:10 - displayed for test purpose you can
08:12 - provide any other exception message or
08:14 - the error message that you want based on
08:16 - your requirements and that is how it is
08:18 - going to work by providing the alt
08:20 - attribute for the image tag it is going
08:23 - to provide certain text message in case
08:25 - there is some issue to display the image
08:28 - over here okay let me just provide the
08:30 - extension over here once again so we
08:32 - will provide PNG and see how it appears
08:36 - along with the alt attribute content
08:38 - over here so let me just save this file
08:40 - now and try reloading this page once
08:42 - again so as you can see since now the
08:45 - image is being displayed there is no alt
08:47 - attribute content or the message that is
08:49 - being displayed right now but guys
08:51 - behind the scenes it will be present so
08:53 - let me just right click over here and
08:55 - use the inspect option in this case so
08:58 - it will open the elements tab over here
09:00 - so if you see there is a alt attribute
09:03 - that is image displayed for test purpose
09:05 - so basically you can see the source code
09:07 - over here for whatever HTML code that is
09:10 - written behind the scenes in order to
09:12 - display this particular web page so Guys
09:14 - these are certain attributes that you
09:16 - can use that is SRC attribute and then
09:19 - we have the alt attribute as well along
09:21 - with this we have also seen how to
09:23 - mention the width and the height of the
09:25 - images that you want to display so guys
