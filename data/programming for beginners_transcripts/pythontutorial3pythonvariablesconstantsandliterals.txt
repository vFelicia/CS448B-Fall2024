00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to Learn
00:03 - Python variables constants and literals
00:06 - so guys what are python variables so in
00:09 - programming a variable is a container
00:11 - that is a storage area to hold data so
00:14 - as we have seen previously a number is a
00:17 - variable and we can provide the value
00:19 - that is 10. so previously we had seen a
00:21 - string variable in which we had stored
00:23 - some statement whereas we can also have
00:25 - the integer values being stored in the
00:28 - variables so over here if we move to our
00:30 - Visual Studio code so we can simply type
00:33 - number that is the variable name which
00:35 - can be assigned a value so equal to 10
00:38 - so this is nothing but an integer value
00:40 - being assigned to a variable which is
00:42 - named as a number we can also have the
00:44 - string so let's say programming for
00:46 - beginners so we have programming for
00:49 - beginners SC string over here which can
00:52 - be assigned to a variable and the
00:54 - variable name can be given as Str or it
00:56 - can be also given as message or any
00:59 - other name that you want to while
01:00 - writing your Python program so Guys
01:02 - these are nothing but variables which
01:04 - can be used later on in the program
01:05 - basically their functionality is to
01:07 - store some values so in this case number
01:09 - is storing the value that is 10 and this
01:11 - Str variable is storing the value that
01:14 - is programming for beginner string now
01:16 - guys it is very important to note that
01:18 - python is a type inferred language so
01:20 - you don't have to explicitly Define the
01:23 - variable type it automatically knows
01:25 - that 10 is an integer and declares the
01:28 - number of variable as the integer so
01:30 - guys basically it depends on the value
01:32 - that we are providing so just because
01:34 - you are typing number as the name of the
01:37 - variable it doesn't mean that it has to
01:39 - be necessarily having the integer value
01:41 - you can also have the string value as
01:44 - well so when I copy this and paste this
01:46 - over here the number will have
01:48 - programming for beginners but guys this
01:50 - doesn't make any sense over here but
01:52 - programmatically this is also possible
01:54 - that's because we don't have to provide
01:56 - any data type over here in the python
01:58 - programs so whatever the value is data
02:00 - type will be given to that particular
02:02 - variable based on the value that is
02:04 - being provided to the variable this is
02:06 - very important Point as far as python
02:08 - programs are concerned in other
02:09 - programming languages such as Java or C
02:11 - plus plus we have a very strict data
02:14 - type that needs to be provided before we
02:16 - provide our variable names over here and
02:19 - guys this is also one of the advantages
02:21 - of using the Python program it allows us
02:23 - to write the code quickly compared to
02:25 - other programming languages now guys
02:27 - moving forward what is the python
02:29 - constant so basically a constant is a
02:31 - special type of variable whose value
02:33 - cannot be changed so for example as you
02:36 - can see the pi value is 3.14 so over
02:39 - here guys before defining the constant
02:41 - variable what we can do is if we simply
02:44 - print this variable over here that is
02:46 - print followed by number that is being
02:48 - given inside the parenthesis I'll save
02:50 - this file and try running this code now
02:52 - so as you can see programming for
02:54 - beginners is getting printed that's
02:55 - because the value is given as
02:57 - programming for beginners let's say I
02:59 - provide the integer that is 20 over here
03:01 - and then when I save this file and try
03:03 - running this code now the number should
03:05 - have the value that is 20 and that is
03:07 - what should be printed so as you can see
03:09 - when we run this code 20 is getting
03:11 - printed over here so whatever value is
03:13 - being stored and whichever variable we
03:15 - want to print the content of that
03:17 - variable will be printed now coming to
03:19 - the constants that we have just defined
03:21 - so in Python let's say if you provide pi
03:24 - equal to 3.14 over here so instead of
03:27 - this number we provide Pi it is equal to
03:29 - 3.14 I'll just remove this line of code
03:31 - and then simply I'll provide pi over
03:34 - here so what will happen is it will
03:36 - display this value that is 3.14 I'll
03:38 - save this file enter running this code
03:40 - now as you can see 3.14 is getting
03:42 - printed but guys what is the use of this
03:45 - constant basically we are saying that Pi
03:47 - is constant over here that's because
03:49 - using this nomenclature that is the
03:51 - constant variable must have all the
03:53 - characters as the upper case so this can
03:56 - Define that it is a constant over here
03:58 - but is it actually a constant and no in
04:01 - this case since again we can use pi over
04:03 - here and we can provide some other
04:05 - values as well such as 5.15 over here so
04:08 - when I save this file and try running
04:10 - this code now it is saying now that Pi
04:12 - is having 5.15 which is the latest value
04:15 - so guys there is no concept of python
04:17 - constants over here right now but what
04:19 - we can do is we can save this value in
04:21 - some other files so let's say I create
04:23 - another file over here and name it as
04:25 - constant followed by the extension that
04:27 - is dot py over here when we press enter
04:30 - we can simply provide this statement
04:32 - that is pi equal to 3.14 I just copy
04:35 - this and paste this over here so we have
04:37 - provided pi equal to 3.14 now what we
04:40 - can do is coming to this python code
04:43 - what we can do is we can use the import
04:46 - keyword now guys this import keyword is
04:48 - used in order to import some other
04:51 - python files into this file so that we
04:53 - can use the content of that other python
04:56 - files over here so we are going to
04:57 - import this constant.py in our python
05:00 - code program so import we can say
05:03 - constant over here so when we type
05:05 - constant as you can see constant is
05:07 - getting Auto suggested over here that's
05:09 - the very important feature of the
05:10 - intellisense which is included in the
05:12 - python extension that we had installed
05:15 - so we provide constant over here and
05:17 - what we have to do is while printing we
05:19 - can simply provide this constant over
05:21 - here that is constant followed by Dot
05:24 - and then as you can see Pi is getting
05:26 - Auto suggested that's because we had
05:28 - defined pi over here so we simply have
05:30 - to provide Pi so what will happen is it
05:33 - will print the value of the pi so when
05:36 - we save this file and try running this
05:38 - code now once again it says module
05:40 - constant has no attribute Pi so guys
05:42 - that may be because we have not saved
05:44 - this file that is constant let me come
05:46 - over here and save this file over here
05:48 - once again and I'll go to this python
05:50 - code and then run this file once again
05:52 - so as you can see now 3.14 is getting
05:54 - displayed so guys if you want to use
05:56 - some constant values you can have a
05:58 - separate file that is called constant.py
06:01 - in which you can store all the constant
06:03 - variables let's say we have another
06:05 - variable over here that is Str and then
06:08 - we provide string as the value so this
06:10 - Str can also be treated as a constant
06:13 - for which the values never change while
06:15 - we are executing the code I'll save this
06:17 - file over here and let's say if I want
06:19 - to print the string as well so I'll copy
06:21 - this line of code basis over here and
06:24 - instead of Pi we will provide Str now so
06:27 - we provide constant.pi and constant.str
06:29 - also so when we save this file and try
06:32 - running this code now we get both the
06:33 - things that is 3.14 we get the string
06:36 - value as well so if you want to use the
06:38 - constants in Python you can have a
06:40 - separate file all of the constants can
06:42 - be defined over there and then you can
06:44 - import that constant file and use the
06:46 - various variables that you have defined
06:48 - as constant in order to write your
06:50 - python programs so guys moving forward
06:52 - over here what are python literals
06:54 - literals are representations of fixed
06:56 - values in a program they can be numbers
06:58 - characters all strings etc for example
07:02 - hello world is one of the literal then
07:04 - 12 is another literal 23.0 and then C
07:08 - character true false Etc so guys
07:10 - literals are nothing but these values so
07:13 - basically this value it is a literal
07:15 - this particular name that we have given
07:17 - is the identifier or also called as
07:20 - variable but in this case it is a
07:22 - constant now this variable becomes
07:23 - constant when the value cannot be
07:25 - changed but we can change this anytime
07:27 - in this code but not over here an
07:30 - identifier can be a constant when we
07:32 - don't want to change its value anytime
07:34 - in our Python program and again the
07:37 - string value inside the double quotes it
07:39 - is a literal so guys I hope you have got
07:41 - enough knowledge about the variables
07:42 - literals and the constant values as far
07:45 - as Python Programming is concerned so
