00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to reverse
00:04 - a number so guys we are going to see two
00:07 - ways in order to reverse a number as you
00:09 - can see the first way is by using the
00:11 - while loop so over here we will be using
00:14 - the logic in order to reverse the number
00:16 - by using the remainder and the Divide
00:19 - operator and the second way is by using
00:21 - the string slicing which we can easily
00:24 - use in order to reverse the number so
00:26 - guys let us check both these methods in
00:28 - the vs code over here so the very first
00:30 - thing that we will be doing is we will
00:31 - Define the number it is equal to let's
00:34 - say we have the number that is 123 over
00:37 - here and we want the reverse of this
00:38 - number which will be 321 so what we will
00:41 - be doing is we will Define another
00:43 - variable that is reverse number over
00:46 - here and initially we will initialize it
00:48 - as zero now after this we will use the
00:51 - while loop over here so while we need to
00:54 - check whether this number is not equal
00:56 - to 0 so we will say num is not equal to
01:00 - 0 in this case so during the first
01:03 - iteration the num is not equal to 0
01:05 - since it is equal to 123 over here so
01:08 - next what we will be doing is we need to
01:10 - get the last digit from this number
01:12 - which we can get by using the remainder
01:14 - operator so over here we will say digit
01:17 - it is equal to we will use this num
01:20 - variable over here percent 10 so
01:23 - basically when we say num person 10 we
01:25 - will get the last digit from this 123
01:28 - number which will be equal to 3 over
01:30 - here now this number that is 3 it will
01:33 - be stored in the digit variable so we
01:35 - can use this digit variable in order to
01:38 - set the Reversed number so this time
01:40 - reverse the number it is equal to we
01:43 - will say reverse number once again
01:45 - multiplied by 10 and then we will say
01:47 - plus this digit over here now guys what
01:50 - is this logic why we have included
01:52 - reverse number multiplied by 10 so
01:54 - basically in the first iteration the
01:56 - Reversed number is 0 right now so 0
01:58 - multiplied by 10 it will be equal to 0
02:01 - and then plus a digit will give us 3
02:03 - over here so reverse the number will be
02:06 - 3 this time next time what will happen
02:08 - is the digit number should store the
02:10 - second number from behind that is number
02:12 - 2 over here so this reverse number
02:14 - currently will be 3 which will make it 3
02:17 - multiplied by 10 it is equal to 30 plus
02:19 - we should get this digit that is 2 so we
02:22 - will get 32 over here and then guys in
02:24 - the third iteration similarly a reverse
02:27 - number would be 32 and then we will get
02:29 - the digit as 1 and it will be 32
02:31 - multiplied by 10 that is 320 plus 1
02:34 - which will give us 321 over here and
02:37 - this is the logic that will help us in
02:38 - order to get the reverse number over
02:40 - here now guys the last step is to reduce
02:42 - the num variable so we will say num it
02:46 - is equal to now we need to divide it by
02:48 - 10 so we say divide operator and then we
02:51 - use the number that is 10. so guys
02:53 - basically we are only getting the number
02:55 - that is 1 and 2 over here that's because
02:58 - the last digit has been already assigned
03:01 - to the Reversed number over here we will
03:03 - see the explanation of all these three
03:05 - lines of code once again in a notepad
03:07 - file so let's say over here we have the
03:10 - number as one two three so we say one
03:12 - two three now guys what's happening over
03:14 - here is num person 10 is giving us this
03:17 - large digit that is 3 so we are storing
03:20 - it into digit over here that is 3 and
03:22 - then reverse number it is equal to 0
03:24 - right now so 0 multiplied by 10 it is
03:26 - equal to 0 plus digit so we are getting
03:29 - reverse number as 3 in this case so
03:31 - reverse number is 3 now after first
03:33 - iteration and num person 10 will give us
03:36 - 2L in this case so we say num it is
03:39 - equal to 12 right now in the second
03:41 - iteration once again num person 10 will
03:44 - give us the last digit that is 2 so
03:46 - inside the digit variable we will have
03:49 - the number two now what do we have in
03:51 - the reverse number currently we have
03:52 - three so three multiplied by 10 will
03:54 - give us 30 plus digit which is having
03:57 - two so it will be 32 right now so we
04:00 - will say 32 in the reverse number and
04:02 - the last step that is num divided by 10
04:04 - will give us 12 divided by 10 which will
04:07 - be equal to 1 this time and then guys
04:09 - again num percent time for this one it
04:12 - will give us 1 over here so digit will
04:14 - be 1 this time and reverse number is
04:16 - already 30 to 32 multiplied by 10 will
04:19 - give us 320 plus digit which is equal to
04:22 - 1 will give us 321 over here so reverse
04:26 - number will be 321 and num divided by 10
04:29 - this time since num value is 1 1 divided
04:32 - by 10 will be 0 so num will become 0
04:34 - right now and when the num is equal to 0
04:37 - the control flow will come out of the
04:39 - while loop over here so basically after
04:41 - the while loop we simply have to print
04:43 - the statement that is reverse the number
04:45 - so we say reverse number over here
04:48 - followed by colon and then we simply
04:51 - have to use the reverse number variable
04:53 - over here so guys let me just save this
04:55 - file now and try running this code so as
04:57 - you can see we have got the reverse
04:58 - number S 3 2 one over here guys we can
05:01 - have any other number instead of 123 so
05:04 - we will say 145 678 so let me just save
05:08 - this file now and try running this code
05:09 - once again so as you can see we have got
05:11 - eight seven six five four and then one
05:14 - which is the reverse of this number that
05:16 - we have just provided so guys this is
05:18 - one way in order to reverse the number
05:20 - by using the while loop over here now
05:22 - what is the second way we can also use
05:25 - the string slicing in this case so how
05:27 - string slicing will work we will remove
05:29 - these lines of code over here once again
05:31 - I will set the number as 123 this time
05:34 - now guys we can simply have the print
05:36 - function directly in order to get the
05:38 - reverse of the number by using the
05:40 - string slicing over here so inside the
05:42 - print statement we will simply say
05:44 - reverse number and then colon and then
05:48 - guys what we have to do is this number
05:50 - needs to be converted to the string
05:52 - first so we will be using the Str class
05:54 - over here as you can see it creates a
05:57 - new string object from the given object
05:59 - so inside the parenthesis we will be
06:02 - providing the num variable so basically
06:04 - we are converting it into a string so 1
06:06 - 2 3 has become a string now and then we
06:09 - can use the open and close square
06:10 - brackets over here and inside the open
06:13 - and close parenthesis we can provide
06:15 - start stop and then step so guys the
06:18 - start and stop need not be provided over
06:20 - here we can simply provide two colons
06:22 - and then in the end we can provide minus
06:25 - 1 over here which represents a step in
06:27 - this case so basically this simple line
06:30 - of code will help us in order to get the
06:33 - reverse of this number that we have
06:35 - provided in the form of string data type
06:37 - and it will be printed on the terminal
06:39 - so let me just save this file now and
06:42 - try running this code once again so as
06:44 - you can see reverse number it is 321
06:47 - over here so guys instead of using any
06:49 - logic by using the while loop you can
06:52 - simply use this string slicing method in
06:55 - order to reverse the number or the
06:56 - string as well now if we provide any
06:58 - other number let's say if we provide
07:01 - 54321 so it should provide us one two
07:04 - three four five as the output which is
07:06 - the reverse of this number let me just
07:08 - run this code once again so as you can
07:10 - see we have got reverse number it is
07:12 - equal to one two three four five guys
07:14 - what will be the answer when we provide
07:16 - nine eight seven as the number over here
07:19 - comment in the comment section below
07:21 - what will be the reverse of this number
07:22 - let us see whether your answer is
07:24 - correct or not so please make sure that
07:26 - you practice on your own so that on
07:27 - different inputs you get different
