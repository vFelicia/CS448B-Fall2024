00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to learn about making text
00:04 - underlined in HTML using the U tag now
00:07 - guys you must have used the underlying
00:09 - formatting feature of the word processor
00:11 - or any other text editor now similarly
00:13 - we can have such formatting in HTML
00:16 - documents as well so in order to make
00:18 - the text as underlined anything that
00:20 - appears within the U tag that is
00:23 - starting and the ending tag will be
00:25 - underlined while showing that HTML
00:27 - element on the browser so guys let us
00:29 - check this with the help of example now
00:30 - in the vs code so previously we had seen
00:33 - how we can make the text as bold by
00:35 - using the B and the strong attacks over
00:38 - here and we have also seen how we can
00:40 - make the text as itally sized now we
00:42 - will have another paragraph so we will
00:44 - start with the P tag over here and then
00:47 - we will say this text is underlined in
00:51 - this paragraph So guys we have the
00:53 - simple statement that this text is
00:55 - underlined in this paragraph let me just
00:58 - save this file now and reload this page
01:00 - to see what happens over here so as you
01:02 - can see it says this text is underlined
01:05 - in this paragraph So guys basically this
01:06 - is a very simple paragraph that we have
01:08 - written now guys what we will do is we
01:10 - will underline these three words that is
01:12 - text is underlined so how we can do that
01:15 - simply we have to come in our source
01:17 - code and we need to enclose these three
01:19 - words within the U tag which stands for
01:22 - underlined so we will simply use the U
01:25 - tag over here and then we will have the
01:27 - greater than sample and then I will just
01:29 - cut this closing tag and then paste it
01:32 - after this word that is underlined over
01:34 - here so guys basically we are enclosing
01:36 - this text is underlined in between the U
01:39 - tag so let me just save this file now
01:41 - and try reloading this page once again
01:43 - you will notice the change in these
01:45 - three words how it will be underlined so
01:48 - when we reload this page page as you can
01:50 - see these three words over here are
01:52 - being underlined in this case and that
01:54 - is how we can use the U tag in order to
01:56 - underline any text in our HTML document
01:59 - guys you can underline any single word
02:01 - in this case or else multiple words
02:03 - based on your requirements so comment in
