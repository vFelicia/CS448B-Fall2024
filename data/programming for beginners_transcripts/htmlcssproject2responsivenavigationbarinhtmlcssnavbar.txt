00:00 - so guys we are going to create a
00:01 - responsive navigation bar that will look
00:03 - like this that is a horizontal
00:05 - navigation bar over here along with some
00:07 - background color when we get the mouse
00:09 - cursor on this Nave bar items and then
00:12 - when we decrease the width of the screen
00:14 - over here which means when we view this
00:17 - on smaller devices the navigation bar
00:19 - will be converted to the vertical
00:21 - navigation bar over here so guys we will
00:23 - check this with the help of the HTML and
00:25 - the CSS code so guys over here inside
00:28 - the HTML CSS projects folder we are
00:31 - going to create another folder that is
00:33 - navigation bar in this case and then
00:36 - inside the navigation bar folder we are
00:38 - going to have the index.html file and
00:41 - the style. CSS files over here so guys
00:44 - let me just create the style. CSS file
00:47 - as well so guys we have created both the
00:49 - files over here so inside the index.html
00:52 - we are going to have the HTML code so
00:54 - let me just use this Mt abbreviation
00:56 - that is exclamation mark in order to
00:59 - have the default HTML template and then
01:02 - guys for the title part we are going to
01:04 - have the navigation bar as the title of
01:06 - this page and also we are going to link
01:09 - this style PSS file with the help of
01:11 - this link tag over here now apart from
01:14 - this inside the body tag we are going to
01:16 - define the HTML elements so what we are
01:18 - going to do is let's say we have the
01:20 - diff tag with the class Nave bar over
01:23 - here so simply we are going to create
01:25 - the diff tag with the class that is na
01:27 - bar in this case and then guys inside
01:29 - this we we are going to have more diff
01:31 - tags that are going to have the
01:33 - navigation bar item so guys simply we
01:36 - are going to create the diff tag with
01:37 - the class item over here inside which we
01:40 - are going to have the a tag with the hge
01:43 - character s the hre and the first
01:45 - element that we have for our navigation
01:47 - bar is the home so basically this is the
01:49 - first item inside the navigation bar and
01:52 - similarly we are going to have multiple
01:54 - items over here so let's say we have the
01:56 - second item as Blog then the third item
01:59 - as videos and then the fourth items say
02:01 - languages that are programming languages
02:04 - over here let me just save this file now
02:06 - and click on this go live icon that can
02:09 - help us in order to display the web page
02:11 - on the browser so guys this can be done
02:13 - with the help of the live server
02:15 - extension on the vs code so if you see
02:18 - on the web browser over here these are
02:20 - the four items that we want to include
02:22 - inside a navigation bar now Guys these
02:24 - are looking just like simple links on
02:27 - the web page but we want to convert it
02:29 - into to a horizontal navigation bar and
02:32 - when we reduce the width of the screen
02:34 - over here the navigation bar should be
02:36 - updated to a vertical navigation bar so
02:39 - we will check that as well with the help
02:41 - of the media queries over here so guys
02:43 - simply we have to go inside the style.
02:45 - CSS file in order to actually make this
02:48 - Nave bar class look like a navigation
02:51 - bar so over here what we will do is
02:53 - simply we are going to provide certain
02:55 - CSS properties for the class name that
02:57 - is naar so we need to provide a DOT
02:59 - character followed by the class name
03:01 - that is Navar over here and then guys
03:03 - inside this let us have certain
03:05 - background color first of all so we will
03:08 - have a dark background color that is
03:09 - black color over here and then apart
03:11 - from this we also want to make the
03:14 - display equal to Flags so that all the
03:16 - items inside the Nave bar class that are
03:20 - these tags over here must be displayed
03:22 - in a row by default guys when we provide
03:25 - the display equal to flex over here by
03:28 - default the flex direction is and all
03:30 - the elements will be displayed in one
03:32 - row over here so when we save this file
03:34 - now and check the changes on the browser
03:36 - as you can see we have the black color
03:38 - as the background color in this case and
03:41 - also we have all the links over here
03:43 - that are getting displayed with the blue
03:44 - color over here guys we are going to
03:46 - make certain changes for these diff tags
03:49 - so what we have to do is simply we will
03:51 - use the class name that is item since
03:53 - the item class name is representing all
03:56 - the diff tags over here that is
03:58 - individual item inside the flex
04:01 - container so guys simply we have to
04:03 - provide this item class over here and
04:06 - first of all we will provide the padding
04:07 - of 10 pixels in this case and then apart
04:10 - from this what we want to do is all the
04:12 - a tags inside this item class must have
04:16 - some CSS properties so we are going to
04:18 - define the item class and then all the a
04:21 - tags inside the item so we are going to
04:24 - use the a selector over here first of
04:26 - all we will have the text decoration as
04:28 - none so that we don't don't have any
04:30 - underline for any of the text that are
04:32 - getting displayed apart from this we
04:34 - will also change the font color to white
04:37 - color so instead of the blue color that
04:39 - is getting displayed over here the white
04:41 - color must be displayed for all these
04:43 - characters so guys let me just save this
04:46 - file now and check the changes so as you
04:48 - can see these are the changes that are
04:50 - getting displayed over here so guys
04:51 - basically this is a very simple
04:53 - navigation bar that we have just created
04:55 - now what we will do is when we get the
04:57 - mouse cursor on any of these diff tags
05:00 - over here we want to change the
05:01 - background color for that particular
05:03 - diff tag that is the navigation bar item
05:07 - so since the diff tag is represented
05:09 - with the help of this item class over
05:11 - here I'm going to copy this item class
05:14 - and then we need to provide the hover
05:16 - sudo class over here for which we want
05:18 - to change the background color so guys
05:20 - we will change the background color to
05:22 - red color in this case when the user
05:24 - gets the mouse cursor on the diff Tex
05:27 - with the class item so let me just save
05:29 - this file now and let us see the changes
05:31 - so as you can see when we get the mouse
05:33 - cursor over here the background color
05:36 - for the diff tags are now getting
05:38 - updated to the red color and this is how
05:40 - the user will be able to get the
05:42 - feedback that he or she will be able to
05:44 - click on that particular navigation bar
05:47 - item now guys you will notice there is
05:49 - certain space on the left hand side and
05:51 - on top of this navigation bar that's
05:53 - because by default certain margin is
05:55 - provided to the body tag over here so
05:58 - simply we will provide the body tag tag
05:59 - in this case and then let me just
06:02 - provide the margin is equal to Auto and
06:04 - also padding is equal to Auto and then
06:06 - apart from this we will also provide the
06:09 - Box sizing CSS property as border box
06:12 - over here so guys it is a best practice
06:14 - in order to provide these three lines of
06:16 - code at the start of the CSS file so
06:19 - that there is no margin and padding that
06:21 - is provided by default to any of the
06:23 - HTML elements that we are going to
06:25 - Define on our web page and then apart
06:27 - from this when we say box ing equal to
06:30 - border box so any of the padding or the
06:33 - Border spaces that are included for the
06:35 - HTML elements the width and height that
06:38 - is taken by those parameters that is
06:40 - borders and padding will be also
06:42 - included as part of the width and height
06:44 - of the HTML elements so guys that is one
06:47 - of the important aspect when you are
06:49 - designing your web page so when we save
06:51 - this file now you will notice that there
06:53 - is no space on the left hand side and on
06:55 - top of this particular navigation bar
06:57 - right now so guys if you want to add
06:59 - more navigation bar items over here
07:02 - simply you have to come inside the HTML
07:04 - file and you can simply copy paste these
07:07 - lines of code in this case and then guys
07:09 - simply we can provide some more items as
07:11 - far as navigation bar items are
07:13 - concerned so let's say we provide the
07:15 - contact tab over here and then apart
07:17 - from this we will also provide about us
07:20 - option in this case and let us also
07:21 - provide certain programming languages so
07:23 - over here we can provide Java for which
07:26 - I have created a separate playlist if
07:27 - you want to learn more about Java Java
07:29 - tutorial and the Java programs as well I
07:32 - have provided the links to the playlist
07:33 - in the description section below apart
07:35 - from this I have also created the
07:37 - playlist for the Python programming
07:39 - language so you can watch out those
07:41 - videos as well the links I have given in
07:43 - the description section below so guys
07:45 - when we save this file now if you notice
07:47 - there are more items that are getting
07:49 - displayed over here on the navigation
07:51 - bar so guys in this way we can simply
07:53 - create a navigation bar using the
07:56 - display equal to flex and the other CSS
07:58 - properties that we have just seen now
08:00 - guys the problem in this particular
08:02 - navigation bar right now is it is a
08:04 - horizontal navigation bar and when we
08:07 - decrease the width of the screen so
08:09 - let's say I have opened the console
08:10 - section over here and when we decrease
08:12 - the width as you can see some of the
08:14 - items are now going on the right hand
08:16 - side and now at the bottom of the screen
08:18 - we are getting the horizontal scroll bar
08:20 - over here guys this is not one of the
08:22 - best practices as far as designing web
08:25 - page is concerned so what we can do is
08:27 - simply we can see what is the maximum
08:30 - width so as you can see over here we are
08:31 - decreasing the width and somewhere over
08:33 - here around 550 pixels the horizontal
08:36 - navigation bar is looking fine in this
08:38 - case and then guys after this when we
08:40 - reduce the size more you can see that it
08:42 - is trying to reduce its size let's say
08:44 - at around 500 pixels or less we want the
08:47 - navigation bar to be displayed as a
08:49 - vertical navigation bar so guys what we
08:51 - can do is simply we can use the media
08:54 - query over here so how do we do that so
08:57 - inside the style. CSS file we we will
08:59 - use media query in this case so we use
09:02 - media screen over here and after this we
09:04 - use the end keyword and then inside the
09:08 - parenthesis we use the max width in this
09:10 - case so guys we need to provide the max
09:12 - width of 500 pixels and then inside the
09:15 - curly braces what we have to do is since
09:18 - we have provided the display equal to
09:20 - flex for the Nave bar over here simply
09:23 - I'm going to copy these lines of code in
09:25 - this case and paste it inside the media
09:27 - screen and then guys we want want this
09:29 - Nave bar to have the flex direction as
09:32 - column so by default the flex direction
09:35 - is Row in this case so simply I'm going
09:37 - to provide the flex Direction instead of
09:40 - the other CSS properties and we are
09:43 - going to change it to column over here
09:45 - so guys whenever the width of the screen
09:47 - is 500 pixels or below the flex
09:50 - Direction equal to column will be
09:51 - implemented for that particular naar
09:54 - class over here which is the navigation
09:56 - bar so let me just save this file now
09:58 - and when we decrease the width of the
10:01 - screen now so as you can see below 500
10:04 - pixels the navigation bar is looking
10:07 - like a vertical navigation bar right now
10:09 - so guys in this way we can easily use
10:11 - the media query in order to convert the
10:14 - navigation bar from horizontal to
10:16 - vertical or visce Versa and then apart
10:19 - from this we have already implemented
10:21 - the other hover properties and the
10:23 - background color changes as well guys
10:25 - based on your requirements you can
10:27 - provide your own CSS properties in the
10:29 - the same code in this case so comment in
