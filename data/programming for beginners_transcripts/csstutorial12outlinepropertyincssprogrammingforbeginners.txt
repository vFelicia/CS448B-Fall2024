00:00 - so now we will see outline property in
00:02 - CSS so guys basically an outline is a
00:05 - line drawn outside of the elements
00:08 - border so whatever border is being
00:10 - provided to the HTML element you can
00:12 - provide the outline which will appear
00:15 - outside of the border of that particular
00:17 - HTML element and we will check this with
00:19 - the help of examples as well with the
00:21 - help of different outline properties so
00:23 - the very first outline property is the
00:26 - outline style which is the required
00:28 - property over here so guys let us move
00:30 - to the vs code in this case and simply
00:32 - I'm going to remove the previous lines
00:34 - of code that we had written over here
00:36 - and we will have the dev element with a
00:38 - sample text that is lorm which is the Mt
00:41 - abbreviation over here that will help us
00:43 - in order to generate the random text in
00:45 - this case apart from that in the style.
00:48 - CSS file I'll simply remove all the
00:50 - lines of code over here so let me just
00:52 - save these files now and try reloading
00:54 - this page on the browser so as you can
00:56 - see we have the random text that is
00:58 - getting generated and being displayed on
01:00 - the web page now guys what we need to
01:02 - check is the border of this particular
01:05 - HTML element needs to be implemented
01:07 - over here and then after that we are
01:09 - going to provide the outline property as
01:11 - well so the very first property in the
01:13 - style. CSS that we are going to apply is
01:16 - the background color over here so let's
01:18 - say we have the background color and the
01:21 - color is aqua in this case and then
01:23 - apart from this let us say we have the
01:25 - border which is going to be 5 pixels and
01:28 - the Border start will be solid in this
01:31 - case with the color that is black over
01:33 - here so guys we have a border of five
01:35 - pixels that is of the solid style in
01:37 - this case and the color is black so let
01:40 - me just save this file now and try
01:41 - reloading this page once again on the
01:43 - browser so as you can see for this div
01:46 - element we have the background color
01:47 - that is aqua and we have the Border
01:50 - color that is black with 5 pixels width
01:53 - now guys simply we can use the outline
01:55 - style property in order to provide the
01:58 - outline to this particular HTML element
02:00 - so let us check that as well so over
02:03 - here we will provide outline in this
02:05 - case and then as you can see these are
02:07 - the suggestions that is being provided
02:09 - by the vs code over here we will be
02:11 - using the outline style and you can see
02:13 - multiple values in this case for the
02:15 - outline style property so we have dashed
02:18 - value or the dotted double Groove hidden
02:22 - inherit and multiple other values as
02:24 - well so let's say we want to provide the
02:27 - dotted outline style so over here we are
02:29 - going to apply the dotted outline style
02:32 - let me just save this file now and try
02:34 - reloading this page once again on the
02:35 - browser as you can see there is a dotted
02:38 - outline that is getting displayed
02:40 - outside of the border that we had
02:43 - implemented now guys let us change the
02:45 - Border color so that we can identify the
02:48 - outline that is wrapping the border so
02:50 - over here what we will do is instead of
02:52 - having the black color let's say we
02:54 - provide red color border so let me just
02:56 - save this file now and try reloading
02:58 - this page so as you you can see after
03:00 - this red color we have the dotted
03:02 - outline over here and that is the
03:04 - meaning of the outline which we can
03:06 - provide outside of the border of the
03:08 - HTML element now guys let us move to
03:11 - another property so we have only
03:12 - provided the outline style so far let us
03:15 - provide the outline width as well of
03:17 - five pixels in this case so when we
03:19 - provide the outline width in this case
03:22 - so basically the width of the outline
03:24 - will be increased and it will be set to
03:26 - 5 pixels so let me just save this file
03:28 - now and try reloading this page once
03:30 - again on the browser so as you can see
03:32 - this is the dotted outline of 5 pixels
03:35 - width that we have provided outside of
03:38 - the border of the HTML element now guys
03:40 - let us move to another attribute we have
03:42 - something called as outline color as
03:44 - well so by default the color of the
03:46 - outline is black color let us provide
03:49 - the outline color in the CSS file so in
03:52 - this case we will provide outline color
03:54 - property and let's say we want to
03:56 - provide the outline color as blue color
03:58 - in this case so let me just save this
04:00 - file now and try reloading this page
04:02 - once again on the browser so as you can
04:04 - see this is the blue color outline that
04:06 - is getting displayed over here outside
04:08 - of the red color border now guys apart
04:10 - from this we can also use the outline
04:12 - shorthand property so similar to The
04:14 - Border property that we have used over
04:17 - here this is the Border Shand property
04:19 - we can provide the values of all these
04:21 - outline properties inside the outline
04:23 - shorthand property so simply I'm going
04:25 - to comment out these lines of code over
04:28 - here let me just save this file now and
04:30 - try reloading this page once again on
04:32 - the browser so as you can see there is
04:34 - no outline for now so what we are going
04:36 - to do is simply we are going to use the
04:38 - outline shorthand property in this case
04:41 - and one by one we are going to provide
04:43 - all these values so first of all we are
04:45 - going to provide the outline width so
04:47 - let's say we have five pixels outline
04:49 - over here and then let's say instead of
04:51 - the dotted style we want to have the
04:54 - solid style of the outline so we provide
04:56 - the solid outline style and Then
04:58 - followed by the outline color so let's
05:00 - say we provide the outline color as blue
05:03 - in this case let me just save this file
05:05 - now and try reloading this page once
05:07 - again on the browser so as you can see
05:09 - we have the outline of blue color now
05:11 - which is wrapping the border of red
05:14 - color so this outline style is being set
05:16 - as the solid outline and that is why you
05:18 - can see the style of the outline is same
05:21 - as that of the style of the border the
05:23 - only difference is the color over here
05:25 - we can change the border and the outline
05:27 - withd as well in order to add identify
05:30 - the outline and Border colors more
05:32 - clearly so we have updated the border
05:34 - and the outline width as 10 pixels over
05:36 - here let me just save this file now and
05:38 - try reloading this page once again on
05:40 - the browser so as you can see this is
05:42 - the border which is having the red color
05:44 - and then we have the blue color outline
05:46 - in this case now guys apart from this we
05:49 - have something called as outline offset
05:51 - as well which means what should be the
05:53 - space in between the border and the
05:56 - outline so by default we don't have any
05:58 - space in in this case in between the
06:01 - outline and the Border colors over here
06:03 - so what if we want certain space let's
06:05 - say we want two pixels of space in
06:07 - between the outline and the border so
06:10 - what we can do is simply we have to
06:12 - provide the outline offset property
06:15 - inside our CSS file so over here we
06:18 - simply have to provide the two pixels
06:21 - width so that there is a space in
06:22 - between the outline and the border for a
06:25 - particular HTML element so let me just
06:28 - save this file now and try reloading
06:30 - this page once again on the browser so
06:32 - as you can see there is a white space
06:34 - you can see in between the red and the
06:37 - blue color which are representing the
06:38 - border and the outline respectively let
06:41 - us increase the space in between the
06:44 - outline and the border so over here
06:45 - let's say we provide 5 pixels as the
06:48 - outline offset so let me just save this
06:50 - file now and try reloading this page
06:52 - once again on the browser so as you can
06:54 - see there's a space in between the
06:56 - border and the outline now and that is
06:58 - how the outline offset will work in
07:00 - order to provide certain spacing in
07:02 - between the border and the outline of
07:04 - the HTML element based on your
07:06 - requirements guys in this way you can
07:08 - easily use the properties of the outline
07:10 - over here either by using the outline
07:12 - shorten property or the individual
07:14 - properties of the outlines comment in
