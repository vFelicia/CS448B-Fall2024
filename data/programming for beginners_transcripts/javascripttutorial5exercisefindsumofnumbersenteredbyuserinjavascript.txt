00:00 - so now we are going to complete this
00:01 - exercise in JavaScript in order to find
00:04 - the sum of numbers that is entered by
00:06 - the user so guys you need to follow
00:08 - these below steps to complete this
00:10 - particular exercise so first of all we
00:12 - will ask the user to enter two numbers
00:15 - using the input fields in HTML so guys
00:18 - let us move to the vs code over here and
00:20 - simply we are going to remove the
00:22 - previous lines of code inside the HTML
00:24 - and the JavaScript files over here that
00:27 - we had written now guys inside the HTML
00:29 - file under the body tag we are going to
00:32 - have two input fields in this case so
00:34 - first of all we will say input followed
00:36 - by colon and this time we are going to
00:39 - have the type attribute as number over
00:41 - here and simply we will provide the
00:43 - value as first number for the name
00:45 - attribute and also we will provide the
00:47 - IDS first number over here apart from
00:50 - this we will provide the line break
00:52 - after the first input and similarly we
00:54 - will have the second input as well this
00:56 - time we will say second number as the
00:58 - name so guys over here we have the value
01:00 - as the second number for the name
01:02 - attribute and for the ID attribute as
01:04 - well we will have the value as second
01:06 - number over here and then guys apart
01:08 - from this we are going to have the
01:09 - button tag in this case so simply we are
01:12 - going to say add as the text of this
01:14 - button and we are also going to have the
01:16 - ID so simply we will say BTN followed by
01:19 - add over here so this button is
01:21 - responsible in order to add the two
01:24 - numbers that will be provided by the
01:25 - user inside these two input fields and
01:28 - then guys apart from this we are going
01:30 - to have the paragraph tag with the ID
01:32 - result over here so that the result of
01:35 - the addition of these two numbers will
01:37 - appear so guys we will simply say sum
01:40 - will appear here so as you can see this
01:43 - is a statement that we have provided
01:45 - inside the paragraph tag let me just
01:47 - save this file now and try reloading
01:49 - this page once again on the browser so
01:51 - as you can see we have these two input
01:53 - Fields followed by the add button and
01:56 - then we have some will appear here now
01:58 - guys what we can do is simply we can
02:00 - provide another line break so that there
02:02 - is certain spacing in between the input
02:04 - fields and the button in this case when
02:06 - we reload this page as you can see we
02:08 - have more spacing in between the HTML
02:11 - elements apart from this we can also
02:13 - provide the placeholder over here so
02:15 - simply we will say first number in this
02:18 - case and we will instruct the user to
02:20 - enter first number as a part of
02:22 - placeholder and again for the second
02:25 - input tag we will have the enter second
02:28 - number as the value for the placeholder
02:30 - let me just save this file now and try
02:32 - reloading this page as you can see we
02:34 - have the placeholders over here so when
02:36 - we click on this particular add button
02:39 - both the numbers that are provided by
02:41 - the user should be added and the result
02:43 - should be displayed over here inside the
02:46 - paragraph tag so guys currently we have
02:48 - not added any JavaScript code so that is
02:50 - the reason why when we click on this
02:52 - particular button nothing is happening
02:54 - over here what we can do is let us
02:56 - provide a certain JavaScript code over
02:58 - here before which we are going going to
03:00 - link the JavaScript file with the help
03:02 - of the script tag in this case so we
03:04 - have the SRC attribute as test.js over
03:07 - here now guys what we have to do is
03:09 - inside the Javascript file we need to
03:12 - extract the values of these two input
03:14 - Fields so the first field is having the
03:17 - ID that is first number over here let me
03:19 - just use that ID inside the document
03:22 - followed by Dot and then we will use the
03:24 - query selector in order to find that
03:27 - HTML element so we have the hash
03:29 - character followed by the ID that is
03:31 - first number over here let us verify
03:33 - whether we have got the correct input
03:35 - field so simply we are going to print
03:38 - this input field on the console so we
03:40 - have provided the console. log statement
03:43 - and enclosed this query selector inside
03:45 - the log statement over here let me just
03:47 - save this file now and try reloading
03:49 - this page as you can see we are getting
03:51 - input type number and the name is first
03:54 - number which means we are able to
03:56 - identify the first input field over here
03:59 - similarly we are going to identify the
04:01 - second input field as well now guys it
04:03 - is very important to note that when we
04:05 - are using this particular query selector
04:07 - we can assign it to a particular
04:09 - variable so simply we make use of the
04:11 - const keyword over here and let's say we
04:14 - provide the variable name as X in this
04:16 - case so guys basically what we are
04:18 - trying to do is we are storing this
04:20 - particular HTML element inside the
04:23 - variable X and in future we can make use
04:26 - of this x variable over here so let's
04:28 - say we want to print this particular
04:29 - HTML element that is X so simply we can
04:32 - make use of the console. log statement
04:35 - and then we can say X in this case when
04:37 - we save this file now and try reloading
04:39 - this page once again on the browser you
04:41 - can notice that now we are able to print
04:44 - the HTML element that is stored inside
04:47 - this particular variable that is x in
04:49 - this case so guys we are going to learn
04:51 - more about variables in the upcoming
04:53 - videos as well so we can make use of the
04:55 - war keyword or let keyword or the const
04:58 - keyword over here when we use the const
05:00 - keyword basically whatever value is
05:02 - assigned to this particular variable
05:04 - will not be updated in the upcoming line
05:07 - of code that we are going to write so
05:09 - guys for now you only have to understand
05:11 - that when we are writing this particular
05:13 - statement the return value is getting
05:16 - assigned to this particular variable
05:18 - which we can use in future now guys this
05:20 - particular X variable is currently
05:22 - having the entire HTML element over here
05:25 - but we only want the number that will be
05:27 - provided by the user inside the input
05:30 - field so what we can do is simply we can
05:32 - provide X followed by Dot and then we
05:35 - will provide value property in order to
05:37 - get the value inside this particular
05:39 - input field so guys we will check that
05:41 - as well how we can use it so before that
05:44 - we are also going to identify the second
05:46 - number as well so over here we have the
05:48 - second statement and this time we will
05:50 - make use of the ID that is second number
05:53 - over here and we will store this
05:54 - particular HTML element inside another
05:57 - variable that is y so guys basically we
05:59 - have X and Y values that are
06:01 - representing these two input fields that
06:04 - is the first number and the second
06:05 - number this time now guys what we have
06:07 - to do is since we are having the button
06:09 - over here we also have to identify the
06:11 - button in this case so again we are
06:13 - going to make use of this ID attribute
06:16 - of this button tag and then again we
06:18 - will use the query selector over here
06:20 - this time we will make use of the button
06:23 - add as the ID of the button and then
06:25 - simply we are going to store it inside
06:28 - the button VAR able so guys basically we
06:31 - have identified all the required HTML
06:33 - elements that are present on the web
06:35 - page over here except the final one
06:37 - which is result in this case so let us
06:40 - provide another statement in order to
06:42 - identify this particular result ID as
06:44 - well so over here we have provided the
06:46 - result ID and also we will provide the
06:49 - variable name that is result in this
06:50 - case now guys very important thing when
06:53 - the user clicks on this particular add
06:55 - button the numbers from both these HTML
06:57 - elements that is X and Y Must Be read by
07:00 - this JavaScript code and both the
07:02 - numbers must be added and it must be
07:04 - displayed inside this particular result
07:06 - HTML element now guys how do we add both
07:09 - these numbers in this case so simply we
07:11 - are going to create a function that will
07:13 - help us in order to add these two
07:15 - numbers so over here let us provide the
07:18 - function and then let us give the
07:20 - function name as add in this case guys
07:22 - don't worry about the snx of this
07:24 - particular function since we are going
07:25 - to cover it with the help of the
07:27 - examples in the upcoming videos as well
07:29 - so for now you only need to understand
07:32 - that this particular function is nothing
07:34 - but a section inside the JavaScript code
07:36 - which we can call single or multiple
07:39 - number of times so guys over here what
07:41 - this add function will do is simply it
07:43 - will extract the value of numbers from X
07:46 - and Y and add those two numbers so let's
07:48 - say we have the element that is X over
07:51 - here followed by Dot and then we have to
07:53 - make use of the property that is value
07:55 - in order to get the value of the first
07:58 - number similarly we will will get the
07:59 - value of the second number as well so in
08:02 - this case we will provide plus operator
08:04 - followed by Y which is the second
08:06 - element in this case and Then followed
08:08 - by Dot and then we have the value
08:10 - attribute so guys over here we have the
08:12 - first number and we also have the second
08:14 - number in this case so guys what we will
08:16 - do is we will assign it to another
08:19 - variable over here so we will say const
08:21 - in this case and then we will provide
08:23 - the variable name as sum and then we
08:25 - will assign it using the equal to
08:27 - operator so basically this is a simple
08:30 - mathematics we are getting the value of
08:32 - x and also we are getting the value of y
08:35 - from these two input Fields over here
08:38 - inside the HTML and adding both the
08:40 - values and providing the value inside
08:43 - another variable that is sum in this
08:45 - case and then guys what we have to do
08:47 - simply we have to call the inner HTML
08:50 - property that we have seen previously so
08:52 - that we can print the sum inside the
08:54 - result variable over here so result
08:57 - variable is currently having the parag
08:59 - graph tag this time which is having this
09:01 - particular statement that is sum will
09:03 - appear here so we will have result
09:05 - followed by Dot and this time we will
09:07 - say inner HTML it is equal to and simply
09:10 - we will say the sum of numbers is
09:15 - followed by colon and then we need to
09:17 - provide the sum variable so how do we do
09:19 - that simply we can make use of the
09:21 - string concatenation over here so we
09:23 - provide the plus operator and then the
09:25 - name of the variable that is sum in this
09:27 - case so guys in this way we can provide
09:29 - the inner HTML attribute we have
09:31 - provided the statement that is the sum
09:33 - of numbers is followed by colon and then
09:36 - the sum that is the number after the
09:38 - addition of both these numbers will be
09:40 - printed inside this result HTML element
09:43 - so let me just save this file now the
09:45 - only thing that is remaining is we need
09:47 - to call this function that is ADD over
09:49 - here when we click on this particular
09:51 - button so guys what we will do is inside
09:53 - the HTML web page over here simply for
09:57 - the button tag we are going to have the
09:59 - onclick attribute and for this attribute
10:02 - we can provide the name of the function
10:04 - that is ADD over here and then followed
10:06 - by the open and close parenthesis so
10:08 - guys basically this is the way we call
10:10 - the function inside the JavaScript that
10:13 - is going to execute certain lines of
10:15 - code that we have written inside this
10:17 - particular function so guys let me save
10:19 - both these files now and when we reload
10:21 - this page once again over here so now
10:23 - when we provide the first number so
10:25 - let's say we provide the number as 10
10:27 - and the second number as 20 and when we
10:29 - click on this particular add button over
10:32 - here you will be able to see the sum of
10:34 - both these numbers that will replace
10:36 - this particular statement so let me just
10:38 - click on this add button over here as
10:40 - you can see the sum of numbers is one20
10:44 - so guys over here there's a mistake that
10:46 - we have done so guys this particular
10:47 - result is unexpected and why it has
10:49 - occurred that's because by default the
10:52 - input field take the values as string
10:54 - over here so basically it has taken the
10:56 - string as 10 and another string as 20
10:59 - and simply it has concatenated both the
11:01 - strings in this case so what we have to
11:04 - do is simply we need to convert both
11:06 - these strings into integers over here so
11:09 - we have something called as pars int
11:11 - function that will help us in order to
11:14 - convert the string to the integer so
11:16 - simply we make use of the parcent
11:18 - function and then enclose the string
11:20 - value inside the parenthesis so we have
11:23 - converted the x value to integer over
11:26 - here and similarly we will convert the
11:28 - string that is represented by the Y
11:30 - value over here to integer in this case
11:33 - so guys basically we have converted X
11:35 - and Y to the integers over here so now
11:37 - both these numbers will be added with
11:39 - the help of this plus operator it is
11:41 - important to note over here that this
11:43 - plus operator can be used in order to
11:46 - add the two numbers or it can also be
11:49 - used in order to concatenate that is
11:51 - join two strings over here that we have
11:54 - just seen so guys let me just save this
11:56 - file now and try reloading this page
11:58 - once again on the browser now we will
12:00 - provide the same numbers that is 10 and
12:02 - 20 and instead of having 1,20 over here
12:05 - we should have the result 1 in this case
12:08 - which is the sum of these two numbers so
12:10 - when we click on this add button over
12:12 - here as you can see the sum of numbers
12:15 - is 30 this time so guys in this way it
12:17 - is very important to note that whenever
12:19 - you are retriving the values of these
12:21 - input Fields you need to convert it into
12:24 - integers or the float numbers as well if
12:27 - you want to add those numbers so guys
12:29 - this is a very simple code in order to
12:31 - take two numbers as the input from the
12:33 - user and add them to find the sum of
12:36 - these two numbers and display them on
12:38 - the web page over here so guys comment
