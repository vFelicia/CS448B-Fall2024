00:00 - so now we will see variables in CSS
00:02 - using we function so guys basically the
00:05 - we function is used to insert the value
00:08 - of a CSS variable and this we are going
00:10 - to check with the help of examples as
00:12 - well a very good way to use the CSS
00:14 - variables is when it comes to the colors
00:17 - of your design so instead of copying and
00:19 - pasting the same colors over and over
00:21 - again for the different CSS selectors
00:24 - you can place them in the variables and
00:26 - you can use the variable names of those
00:29 - colors and apply those colors to the
00:31 - different selectors based on your
00:32 - project requirements so guys this is the
00:34 - syntax as you can see we first of all
00:36 - use the we keyword followed by two *
00:38 - hyphen and then we have the name of the
00:41 - variable now guys apart from this we
00:42 - also have the second argument that is
00:44 - value which is optional so basically
00:46 - name is required in which case the
00:48 - variable name must start with the two
00:50 - dashes and basically this is the name of
00:52 - the variable for which you have already
00:55 - set the specific value apart from this
00:57 - this value is optional over here which
00:59 - is the second argument it is the
01:01 - fallback value which will be used if the
01:03 - variable is not found so guys you will
01:05 - be having the list of variables that you
01:07 - have already set but let's say if this
01:09 - particular specific variable is not
01:11 - present in your list of variables then
01:14 - you will be using this particular value
01:16 - that will be provided as the second
01:18 - argument now guys let us check this with
01:19 - the help of examples in VSS code over
01:21 - here so simply I'm going to remove the
01:23 - previous lines of code that we have
01:25 - written in the HTML and the CSS files in
01:27 - this case now simply we are going to
01:29 - have the the div tag over here and then
01:31 - we will have the lurm Mt abbreviation
01:33 - with 30 words over here and then apart
01:35 - from this let us say we have a test
01:38 - button in this case so guys simply we
01:40 - are going to use the button tag and we
01:42 - will say test button over here let me
01:44 - just save this file now and try
01:46 - reloading this page on the browser to
01:47 - see how it looks like so as you can see
01:49 - this is the diff tag that is having the
01:51 - random text that is getting generated
01:53 - and then we have the test button over
01:55 - here now guys let us provide certain CSS
01:58 - properties to the background that is the
01:59 - body tag over here and to the diff tag
02:02 - and to the test button as well so let us
02:04 - move to the style. CSS file in this case
02:07 - and then simply for the body tag we will
02:09 - provide certain background color and
02:11 - this time we will be using some dark
02:13 - background color over here so it is a
02:15 - shade of gray color in this case and
02:17 - then apart from this for the diff tag
02:19 - also we will have certain background
02:21 - color in this case so guys let us say we
02:24 - have the same color but we are going to
02:26 - have a darker version of this particular
02:28 - color so let me just adjust the color
02:30 - over here so as you can see we can set
02:32 - this particular background color apart
02:34 - from this let us also set the padding of
02:36 - 10 pixels over here and also we want to
02:38 - set the text color with the help of the
02:40 - color CSS property to the same value
02:43 - that is present as the background color
02:44 - for the body tag so simply I'm going to
02:47 - copy this particular color over here now
02:49 - guys apart from this what we will do is
02:51 - also for the test button as well we will
02:53 - have the background color and the text
02:55 - color as well same as the background
02:57 - color in the text color that we have set
02:59 - set for the diff tag so simply I'm going
03:01 - to copy these lines of code over here
03:04 - now guys if you notice the same colors
03:06 - are being used as the background color
03:08 - over here and for the text colors as
03:10 - well and in case your project size grows
03:12 - and if you use the same color across
03:14 - multiple selectors it will be very
03:16 - complex in order to maintain them and in
03:19 - case if you want to update any of the
03:21 - colors you will have to update them in
03:23 - all the locations so let us see how it
03:25 - looks like on the browser first of all
03:27 - so let me just save this file now and
03:29 - try the reloading this page once again
03:31 - on the browser so as you can see we have
03:33 - the background color for the body tag
03:35 - and then for the diff tag as well we
03:36 - have the darker version of the
03:38 - background color for the diff tag and
03:40 - the button as well and then the lighter
03:42 - version of the color being used for the
03:44 - text color over here now guys what we
03:46 - can do is instead of providing the fixed
03:48 - colors inside all these CSS properties
03:52 - simply we can provide the variables and
03:54 - set these values to those variables and
03:57 - use those variable names as the values
03:59 - for these CSS properties inside these
04:02 - CSS selectors so guys how we can
04:04 - Implement that so first of all we will
04:06 - see how we can use the global scope
04:08 - variable so guys there are two types of
04:10 - variables one is global scope and the
04:12 - other one is local scope so we use the
04:14 - colon over here followed by the root
04:16 - keyword and inside this we can Define
04:19 - our various variables that will be
04:21 - having the color values and we will be
04:23 - using those variables inside individual
04:25 - selectors and this is the way that we
04:27 - can use the global variables over here
04:29 - now guys as far as local variables are
04:31 - concerned we can Define the variables
04:34 - inside a specific selector so let's say
04:36 - we want a local variable to be defined
04:38 - inside this diff tag so simply we can
04:40 - Define the variable inside this diff tag
04:43 - and use it within this particular diff
04:45 - tag over here we cannot use the local
04:47 - variable outside of this div tag to any
04:50 - other CSS selector so that is the
04:52 - limitation of the local variable so guys
04:54 - first of all let us see how the global
04:56 - variable works so in order to define the
04:59 - variable we have to provide two times
05:01 - Hyun and Then followed by the name of
05:03 - the variable so let's say we provide
05:05 - light color as the name of the variable
05:08 - followed by colon and out of both these
05:10 - colors this is the lighter version that
05:12 - is 6 * a over here so simply we are
05:14 - going to provide this particular hex
05:16 - color that is light gray color over here
05:19 - and then apart from this we want the
05:21 - darker version as well so again we are
05:23 - going to provide two times hyon and then
05:25 - we will say dark color in this case so
05:27 - guys basically this is the name of the
05:29 - table that we have set and Then followed
05:31 - by colon and then we need to provide the
05:33 - value of the dark color that is 76 76 76
05:37 - so simply we can provide the hash
05:38 - character followed by the color value
05:41 - over here so guys this is the way that
05:43 - we can set the multiple variables which
05:45 - is at the global scope right now so
05:47 - since we have already provided the
05:49 - variable names over here and we have
05:51 - also provided the values simply we can
05:53 - use these names that is the color names
05:56 - instead of having the values across a
05:58 - different individuals CSS selectors so
06:01 - guys let me just update all these colors
06:03 - over here so the background color for
06:04 - the body tag is the light color over
06:07 - here so instead of having this value we
06:09 - will use the V keyword in this case and
06:11 - then simply as you can see it is being
06:13 - suggested by the vs code we want to use
06:15 - this particular variable that is light
06:17 - color over here always remember that you
06:19 - have to use two times hyphen character
06:22 - when you're defining the variable and
06:23 - when you are using the variable apart
06:25 - from this we will have the dark color
06:27 - over here so simply we are going to
06:29 - where and then we will use the dark
06:31 - color in this case and the color CSS
06:33 - property will have the light color over
06:35 - here once again so simply we will have
06:37 - light color as a variable and then again
06:39 - we have the dark color and the light
06:41 - color as the background color and the
06:43 - text color for the button so simply we
06:45 - will set the dark color as the variable
06:47 - name over here and light color for the
06:49 - text color in this case so guys as you
06:51 - can see now we are using the variable
06:54 - names instead of using the fixed color
06:56 - values that we had set previously and in
06:59 - this way whenever you want to change the
07:01 - color values over here simply you have
07:03 - to change the color values only at this
07:06 - particular one location where you have
07:08 - set the variables so let me just save
07:10 - this file now and try reloading this
07:12 - page once again on the browser notice
07:14 - that there is no change right now that's
07:15 - because we have set the same color
07:17 - values over here now guys let us check
07:19 - another combination of colors so let's
07:21 - say you want the light color to be the
07:23 - yellow color so simply we can set the
07:25 - yellow color over here and also we want
07:28 - some other version of the yellow color
07:30 - so simply we are going to update this
07:32 - yellow color to this particular RGB
07:34 - value and then apart from this we want
07:36 - the dark color to be some other version
07:38 - of the black color so let's say we have
07:40 - this particular color as the dark color
07:43 - in this case so let me just save this
07:44 - file now and notice that we have only
07:46 - changed the light color over here where
07:48 - we have defined this particular variable
07:50 - but it will be implemented everywhere
07:53 - wherever we have used the light color
07:55 - and the dark color variables so when we
07:57 - reload this page once again on the
07:59 - browser so as you can see all the colors
08:01 - are updated now the background color of
08:03 - the body tag is updated to the light
08:05 - color then we have the background color
08:06 - of the diff tag and the button is also
08:09 - updated with the dark color that we have
08:11 - specified over here and the text color
08:13 - is also the light color that we have
08:15 - used now guys let us say we want some
08:17 - other color for the test button and over
08:19 - here we have not defined that particular
08:21 - color so let's say we have another
08:23 - variable that is another color over here
08:26 - so guys basically this another color is
08:28 - not yet defined inside the global
08:30 - variable and in such cases if you are
08:33 - not sure that you have not mentioned
08:35 - this particular variable inside the
08:37 - global scope then simply you can provide
08:39 - the second argument over here so let's
08:42 - say you want aqua color to be used in
08:44 - case this particular another color
08:46 - variable is not present so in this case
08:48 - what will happen is currently it is
08:50 - getting displayed as the yellow color as
08:52 - far as the text color of this button is
08:54 - concerned but now since we are using
08:56 - another color as the variable name which
08:58 - is not present in inside this root
09:00 - selector over here so aqua color will be
09:03 - implemented as the text color for this
09:05 - button so let me just save this file now
09:07 - and try reloading this page once again
09:09 - on the browser so as you can see the
09:11 - text color of this button is now updated
09:13 - with aqua color over here and in this
09:15 - way you can use the second argument that
09:18 - is value inside the we function over
09:20 - here in order to provide the required
09:22 - colors now guys apart from this you can
09:24 - also make use of the local variables
09:26 - over here so what we can do is let's say
09:28 - you have already defined the light color
09:31 - over here but you want to Define some
09:33 - other light color for the diff tag so
09:35 - simply I'm going to copy this line of
09:37 - code over here and paste it inside the
09:39 - diff selector and in case of using the
09:42 - yellow color I want to use some version
09:44 - of the green color so we are going to
09:46 - use some shade of green color over here
09:48 - as the light color in this case so as
09:50 - you can see we have updated the RGB
09:52 - color over here for the light color now
09:54 - guys we have two variables with the same
09:56 - name first of all we have the light
09:58 - color over here which is having the
10:00 - global scope and inside the diff tag we
10:02 - have the light color which is having the
10:04 - local scope so in this case when we use
10:06 - the text color and provide the light
10:09 - color variable over here so which color
10:11 - will be used so guys let us check that
10:13 - as well so when we save this file now
10:14 - enter I reloading this page once again
10:16 - on the browser so as you can see green
10:18 - color is getting implemented over here
10:20 - as the text color inside the diff tag so
10:23 - guys this tells us that whatever
10:25 - variable we Define inside the specific
10:28 - CSS selector which we call it as the
10:30 - local variable so that value will be
10:33 - used wherever we use the light color in
10:35 - this case and let's say when we use the
10:37 - light color somewhere else let's say we
10:39 - use the light color over here to the
10:41 - button text so guys the light color is
10:43 - already defined as the yellow color over
10:45 - here so instead of providing the aqua
10:47 - color the yellow color should be
10:49 - displayed so let me just save this file
10:50 - now and try reloading this page once
10:52 - again on the browser so as you can see
10:54 - the global value that is the yellow
10:56 - color for the light color is getting
10:58 - displayed over here and the local value
11:00 - is getting displayed for the diff tag
11:02 - because we have provided the local
11:04 - variable over here so guys in this way
11:06 - whenever you use the local variables
11:09 - that particular value will overwrite the
11:11 - value of the global variable that you
11:13 - have already defined inside the root
11:15 - selector so guys in this way you can
11:17 - easily use the variable names in order
11:19 - to avoid the confusion when you have
11:21 - several CSS selectors and you want to
11:23 - use the same set of colors based on the
11:25 - theme of your project so guys comment in
