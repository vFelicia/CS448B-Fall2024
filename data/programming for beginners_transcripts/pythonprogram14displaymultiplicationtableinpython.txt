00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to display the
00:05 - multiplication table so guys this Python
00:08 - program should help us in order to
00:09 - display the multiplication table of the
00:12 - number that is entered by the user so
00:14 - let's say for example the number that is
00:16 - entered by the user is 12 so we will
00:18 - take all the numbers starting from the
00:20 - number one up to the number 10 and we
00:23 - will do 12 multiplied by 1 it is equal
00:25 - to 12 and so on the products of all
00:28 - these numbers will be displayed and that
00:30 - is what we call it as a multiplication
00:32 - table so as any number that is entered
00:34 - by the user we will generate this kind
00:36 - of multiplication table using the Python
00:39 - program so guys let us move to the vs
00:41 - code over here the very first thing that
00:43 - we have to take from the user is the
00:45 - number variables over here we will take
00:47 - the input from the user and convert it
00:49 - into the integer since the input
00:51 - function will give us the string data
00:54 - type by default and that is why we have
00:55 - provided this in function as the prefix
00:57 - so over here we will say enter
01:00 - the number to display multiplication
01:05 - table
01:08 - and then user will be providing the
01:10 - number over here and then once a user
01:12 - press enters we have to provide the
01:14 - entire multiplication table to the user
01:17 - so guys we will be using the for Loop
01:19 - over here so for and then we will be
01:21 - iterating through the variable that is I
01:24 - and then n we will be using the range
01:26 - function over here the range will go
01:28 - from 1 up to 10 so we have to take 11 as
01:32 - the second parameter over here so the
01:34 - numbers will be from 1 to 10 because the
01:36 - second parameter that is 11 it will be
01:38 - not included and then what we have to do
01:40 - is we have to Simply multiply this
01:42 - number by I value 1 at a time and print
01:45 - the values over here so guys after colon
01:48 - we will be simply printing the
01:49 - multiplication table over here so one at
01:52 - a time we have to take the value of I
01:54 - and multiply it by the number that is
01:56 - entered by the user so the very first
01:57 - thing that we have to do is we have to
01:59 - provide the curly braces and over here
02:01 - the number that is entered by the user
02:03 - will be coming because this is the
02:05 - expression that we want that is 12
02:06 - multiplied by 1 it is equal to 12 the
02:09 - next time we want 12 multiplied by 2 it
02:11 - is equal to 24 so over here we will be
02:14 - providing the number and then over here
02:16 - we will provide multiplication symbol
02:18 - and then over here the value of I will
02:21 - be coming and then we have equal to
02:23 - operator and then again we will be
02:25 - having the product of these two numbers
02:27 - and then after this we can simply use
02:29 - the dot format function in order to
02:31 - Simply provide what the variable names
02:33 - will be for these curly braces so the
02:36 - very first thing will be number over
02:37 - here that is entered by the user so we
02:39 - say number followed by comma and then
02:42 - this will be the value of I which is
02:44 - ranging from 1 to 10 so over here we
02:47 - will provide I over here and then comma
02:49 - this will be the product of the
02:51 - multiplication of both these numbers so
02:54 - it will be number multiplied by I so
02:56 - over here we can simply provide the
02:58 - parent asset and inside this we can
03:00 - provide a number multiplied by I over
03:02 - here which will give us the product of
03:04 - these two numbers and it will be
03:05 - displayed over here on the third open
03:07 - and close curly braces so guys this is
03:09 - the way that we should get the entire
03:11 - multiplication table of the enter number
03:13 - before that what we can do is we can
03:15 - also have the print statement and we can
03:17 - simply provide the label that is
03:19 - multiplication table so over here we say
03:22 - multiplication table now guys let me
03:24 - just save this file now enter running
03:26 - this code so for the very first example
03:28 - what we will do is we will take the same
03:30 - example that is a number 12 and generate
03:32 - the multiplication table of this number
03:34 - so over here enter the number to display
03:36 - multiplication table we will provide 12
03:39 - as the number and when we press enter as
03:41 - you can see we are getting the entire
03:43 - multiplication table I'll just expand
03:45 - this terminal so over here as you can
03:47 - see 12 multiplied by 1 it is equal to 12
03:49 - then we have 12 multiplied by 2 24 then
03:52 - we have 36 48 60 up to 12 multiplied by
03:55 - 10 that is 120 now guys you can also
03:58 - increase this number instead of showing
04:00 - the table from 1 to 10 we can also show
04:03 - it from 1 to 20 so over here what we
04:05 - have to do is simply we have to replace
04:07 - this 11 by 21 so this you can take it as
04:10 - a homework for you in order to display
04:11 - the multiplication table in such a way
04:13 - that the factors will be from 1 to 20.
04:16 - now guys let us run this code once again
04:17 - over here this time what we will be
04:19 - doing is we will take another number so
04:21 - let's say we take the number 18 this
04:23 - time when we press enter we get the
04:25 - entire multiplication table of 18 so as
04:27 - you can see we have 18 multiplied by 1
04:30 - it is 18 then we have 18 multiplied by 2
04:32 - it is 36 and so on we are getting 18
04:35 - multiplied by 10 it is equal to 180 so
04:38 - guys this is the very simple way in
04:40 - order to get the entire multiplication
04:42 - table just by using this one line of
04:44 - code inside the for Loop we were able to
04:46 - generate the entire multiplication table
04:48 - so guys practice on your own so that on
04:50 - different inputs you get different
04:52 - outputs please make sure that you like
04:54 - this video so that it reaches to more
04:55 - people and subscribe to this channel so

04:59 - upcoming videos as well the next video
05:01 - that we are going to talk about is
