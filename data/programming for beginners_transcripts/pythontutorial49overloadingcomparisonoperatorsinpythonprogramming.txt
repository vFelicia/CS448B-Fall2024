00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about overloading comparison operators
00:06 - in Python Programming so guys previously
00:08 - we have seen how we can overload the
00:10 - plus operator in the python so python
00:13 - also allows us to overload comparison
00:16 - operators as well such as less than or
00:18 - greater than or less than or equal to or
00:21 - else greater than or equal to and so on
00:23 - many other comparison operators are
00:25 - present in Python Programming which can
00:27 - be overloaded so for example as you can
00:29 - see we have the class that is person and
00:31 - then we have the Constructor which takes
00:33 - the parameter as the cell and then name
00:36 - and age is taken so basically this name
00:38 - and age are being assigned to the name
00:41 - and age attributes of the class and then
00:43 - we have the overloading of the less than
00:45 - operator over here in this case so as
00:48 - you can see we have the function Def and
00:50 - Then followed by underscore underscore
00:52 - LT which refers to the less than sign
00:55 - over here and then double underscore
00:57 - once again and then it takes one object
00:59 - that is the self object over here it
01:01 - takes the other object that is the
01:03 - second object so what we can do is we
01:05 - can create the two objects over here
01:07 - that is P1 it is equal to person the
01:10 - name is allies and the age is 20 years
01:12 - old and then we have P2 that is another
01:14 - person the name is Bob and the person is
01:17 - 30 years old so guys basically what we
01:19 - are doing is we are printing over here
01:21 - P1 less than P2 so we are checking
01:24 - whether P1 is less than P2 or not so
01:26 - what exactly will happen is instead of
01:28 - this less than the control flow will go
01:31 - over here to this particular function
01:33 - because we have provided the comparison
01:35 - operator overloading over here so the
01:38 - first object will be P1 in this case
01:40 - which will be assigned to self and the
01:42 - second object will be P2 over here which
01:44 - will be assigned to the other and self
01:46 - dot h will be compared whether it is
01:49 - less than the other dot age over here if
01:51 - it is yes then it will return true or
01:54 - else it will return false so guys let us
01:56 - implement this in our vs code over here
01:58 - so let's say we have the class person in
02:01 - this case and then what do we do is we
02:04 - Define the Constructor over here so def
02:06 - keyword followed by the init function in
02:09 - this case so I am going to implement the
02:11 - Constructor over here so what we will do
02:13 - is let's say we have self dot name it is
02:16 - equal to the name will be taken as the
02:18 - parameter over here so let's say I
02:20 - provide name one and then age 1 over
02:22 - here so that we can identify them so
02:24 - name it is equal to name one and then we
02:28 - have cells dot h it is equal to H1 so
02:31 - the name and age will be coming as the
02:33 - parameters when we are going to
02:34 - initialize the object when we are
02:36 - creating the object of the person class
02:38 - and those name and age will be assigned
02:41 - to these variable names that is name and
02:43 - age and then guys what we will do is we
02:45 - will be doing the comparison operator
02:47 - overloading so over here we are going to
02:50 - Define double underscore and then LT
02:53 - over here so which refers to the less
02:55 - than operator in this case and it is
02:57 - going to take two parameters one is self
03:00 - parameter and then the other object so
03:03 - over here the second parameter is the
03:04 - other object and this thing is simply
03:06 - going to return the comparison of the
03:09 - two edges over here so this will be
03:10 - written cell dot age is it less than the
03:15 - other dot h so over here we are simply
03:18 - going to compare where the self dot h is
03:20 - less than other dot h or not if yes then
03:23 - return true or else return false so guys
03:25 - what we will do is we will create two
03:27 - person objects over here so let's say P1
03:30 - it is equal to the person and let's say
03:33 - the first person name is Tom and Tom is
03:36 - 10 years old in this case and then let's
03:38 - say we have P2 it is equal to percent
03:41 - and let's say the name of this person is
03:44 - Harry and Harry is 20 years old so guys
03:47 - what we will do is simply we need to
03:49 - print two statements comparing the ages
03:51 - of both the person so we will say P1 is
03:54 - it less than P2 then it will return true
03:57 - or false so is P1 less than P2 yes in in
04:00 - this case because p1's 8 is 10 and p2's
04:03 - age is 20 and that is what this
04:05 - particular function will be implementing
04:07 - and returning the result and over here
04:09 - again we will say print P2 is less than
04:12 - P1 this time so P2 less than P1 this
04:15 - time so is P2 less than P1 so what will
04:18 - happen is is 20 less than 10 no in this
04:21 - case so this should return false so let
04:23 - me just save this file now and try
04:24 - running this code so as you can see for
04:26 - first statement we are getting it as
04:28 - true and for second statement we are
04:29 - getting the result as false to make it
04:31 - more understandable what we can do is we
04:34 - can provide the statements over here is
04:36 - term younger
04:39 - than any
04:41 - question mark and then
04:44 - we can have a comma over here and
04:46 - similarly we can have such statement in
04:48 - the second print statement as well so
04:50 - over here we will say is Harry younger
04:54 - than Tom in this case
04:56 - so we have is Harry younger then Tom so
04:59 - let me just save this file now and try
05:00 - running this code so as you can see is
05:02 - Tom younger than Harry so Tom H is 10
05:05 - and Harry is age is 20 right now so it
05:08 - is returning true that Tom is younger
05:10 - than Harry and second time is Harry
05:12 - younger than Tom Harry is 20 years old
05:15 - Tom is 10 years old so it is saying is
05:17 - Harry younger than Tom no in this case
05:19 - so that is why we are getting the result
05:20 - as false what if we have another person
05:23 - with the same name that is Tom who is 30
05:25 - years old so over here we will update
05:27 - the age of Tom that is another person
05:29 - who is 30 years old and we are comparing
05:32 - it with the same person that is Harry
05:34 - which is 20 years old so let me just
05:36 - save this file now and try running this
05:38 - code this time is Tom younger than Harry
05:40 - no in this case because Tom is Elder
05:43 - than Harry right now so we are getting
05:44 - false and in the second statement is
05:46 - Harry younger than Tom yes because 20 is
05:49 - less than 30 this time so we are getting
05:51 - true in this case so guys this is the
05:53 - way that we can implement the comparison
05:55 - operator overloading as as far as Python
05:57 - Programming is concerned so guys please
05:59 - make sure that you practice on your own
06:00 - so that on different inputs you get
06:02 - different outputs please make sure that
06:04 - you like this video so that it reaches

06:07 - channel so that you get the
06:09 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
06:11 - the next video that we are going to talk
06:12 - about is iterator in Python Programming
06:15 - so stay tuned
