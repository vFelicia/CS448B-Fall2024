00:00 - so guys we are going to create these
00:02 - social media icons that will help your
00:04 - users on the website to share the URL to
00:07 - the different social media platforms and
00:09 - when the user gets the mouse cursor on
00:11 - these social media icons they are going
00:13 - to scale up little bit and that is how
00:15 - you can provide a good user experience
00:17 - for your user so guys let us move to the
00:19 - vs
00:20 - code so let us create another folder
00:23 - over here since it is the sixth project
00:25 - we are naming it as 06 uncore and then
00:28 - we will say social media icons in this
00:31 - case and then guys inside this folder
00:33 - let us create two files that is
00:35 - index.html file which will help us in
00:37 - order to create the web page and then
00:40 - apart from this we will also create the
00:41 - style. CSS file that will help us in
00:44 - order to provide the different CSS
00:46 - properties now guys over here inside the
00:48 - index.html file let us create the HTML
00:51 - template over here and for the title
00:53 - part we will say social media icons so
00:57 - guys basically this is the title and
00:58 - then we are going to link the style. CSS
01:01 - file by using this link colar CSS M
01:04 - abbreviation and then we are going to
01:06 - provide hrf it is equal to style. CSS
01:09 - now guys apart from this in order to
01:11 - create the social media icons we can
01:14 - include the external style sheet over
01:16 - here so as you can see we are going to
01:18 - make use of this box icons.com website
01:22 - which helps us in order to provide the
01:23 - different icons and basically we are
01:25 - going to make use of this sty sheet so
01:28 - let me just copy this link I will will
01:30 - provide both these links in the
01:31 - description section below so guys over
01:33 - here after copying the external CSS file
01:36 - we are going to paste it inside the head
01:38 - section of the body tag over here so
01:40 - basically this is the link that is going
01:42 - to be used in order to make use of the
01:44 - different icons that are present on the
01:47 - website so guys over here what we will
01:49 - do is first of all we will create a div
01:51 - tag with the class container over here
01:53 - inside which we will have different
01:55 - social media icons and then in this case
01:57 - we are going to have the a tag over here
02:00 - we have the a tag in this case and let
02:02 - me just provide the class as Link in
02:04 - this case and then after this inside the
02:06 - a tag we can have the it tag now guys
02:09 - how you can display the links over here
02:11 - so let us open this website that is box
02:13 - icons.com so basically this is the
02:15 - website that we are going to use and
02:17 - then you can see that there are
02:18 - different icons you can provide on your
02:21 - web page so guys over here let's say
02:23 - first of all we want the Facebook icon
02:25 - so the moment you search for Facebook
02:27 - you can see different social media icons
02:30 - that can be used on your web page so
02:32 - let's say we want to make use of this
02:33 - particular icon so when we click on this
02:36 - additional information will be provided
02:38 - on the right hand side we need to switch
02:39 - to the font section over here and as you
02:41 - can see this is the link that is
02:43 - provided so let me just zoom in little
02:45 - bit so that you can see properly so
02:47 - basically this is the font and this is
02:49 - the tag that we are supposed to include
02:51 - so let me just click on this and
02:53 - basically it will get copied on the
02:55 - clipboard so over here inside the a tag
02:57 - we are supposed to provide this I tag
02:59 - tag over here that we have copied and
03:01 - basically it is having the class with
03:03 - this particular value so guys what this
03:05 - will do is it will display the icon on
03:08 - the web page so let us check this on the
03:10 - web browser let me just save this file
03:12 - now and let us open the live server over
03:14 - here by clicking on this Co live button
03:17 - so as you can see this is the icon that
03:19 - is getting displayed over here on the
03:21 - top left now guys similarly what we will
03:23 - do is we will make use of the other
03:25 - icons as well from that same website so
03:27 - let me just copy paste these lines of
03:29 - code over here and simply instead of
03:31 - Facebook we are going to make use of the
03:33 - other social media icons so we have
03:36 - Twitter over here and then we also have
03:38 - YouTube in this case and then let's say
03:40 - we have Instagram as well so over here
03:42 - we provide the Instagram so basically
03:44 - you just need to change the class name
03:46 - in this case you can also come over here
03:48 - on the box icon website and then you can
03:51 - provide the icon that you want to
03:53 - display so let's say you want to search
03:55 - for YouTube over here so YouTube icon
03:58 - will be displayed and then simply you
03:59 - can copy paste this itag from this
04:02 - particular website so guys basically we
04:04 - have included four icons over here let
04:06 - us add another one that is Snapchat as
04:08 - well so instead of Instagram we will say
04:10 - Snapchat in this case it is best
04:12 - practice to copy this it tag from this
04:15 - website so that you don't get any issues
04:17 - while you are renaming the class names
04:19 - over here so guys let me just save this
04:21 - file now and when we see the same web
04:23 - page over here as you can see these are
04:25 - all the icons that are getting displayed
04:27 - in this case now guys since we have
04:29 - included all all the social media icons
04:31 - inside the a tag that is why we are
04:33 - getting the underline and all of them
04:35 - are having the color that is blue color
04:37 - in this case so what we will have to do
04:39 - is we will provide the CSS properties
04:41 - for all these classes that we have
04:43 - provided over here so first of all let
04:45 - us copy this container class in this
04:47 - case and then let's provide some CSS
04:49 - properties over here to The Container
04:51 - class so first of all we will say
04:53 - display it is equal to flex and then we
04:55 - want to get it at the middle of the
04:57 - screen so let's say we provide justify
04:59 - content as Center over here let me just
05:01 - save this file now as you can see all
05:02 - the icons are now getting displayed at
05:04 - the center of this page as far as
05:06 - horizontal alignment is concerned now
05:08 - guys let us also provide certain margin
05:10 - from top so that we have some spacing
05:12 - from top of the page as well so we
05:14 - provide 50 pixels of margin from Top
05:16 - over here now guys let us provide
05:18 - certain CSS properties to this link
05:21 - class as well so that the properties
05:23 - will be applied to the icons so over
05:25 - here we provide dot followed by the
05:27 - class name that is linked in this case
05:28 - and then what we we will do is first of
05:30 - all we will provide the width and height
05:32 - for this particular link class so let's
05:34 - say we have the width of 30 pixels over
05:36 - here and also we will provide the height
05:38 - of 30 pixels in this case so that we get
05:41 - a square box out of this link class over
05:43 - here and also we want to make this link
05:45 - as a circular shape length so what we
05:48 - will do is simply we will say border
05:50 - radius it is equal to 50% in this case
05:53 - and let us temporarily give some
05:54 - background color over here so that we
05:56 - can identify the area of this glass that
05:59 - is l link so let me just save this file
06:01 - now so if you notice we have all these
06:03 - circular shaped link over here now guys
06:05 - inside the circles we want all these
06:07 - icons to be present at the center of the
06:09 - circle so what we will do is again we
06:11 - will say display it is equal to flex
06:13 - this time and then we will say justify
06:15 - content it is equal to Center so that
06:17 - they are at the center as far as the
06:19 - horizontal alignment is concerned and
06:21 - then we will get them at the center as
06:24 - far as vertical alignment is concerned
06:26 - so we have to make use of the Align
06:28 - items over here and again we will make
06:30 - use of the center value so as you can
06:32 - see all the icons are now at the center
06:35 - of the circle in this case now guys we
06:37 - will have to remove the underlines that
06:39 - are coming over here so simply we will
06:41 - say text decoration it is equal to none
06:43 - and also we will change the font color
06:45 - over here so let's say we provide the
06:47 - color as white color in this case so
06:49 - simply we provide the color as white we
06:51 - need to have certain dark background
06:53 - color in this case so what we will do is
06:55 - let's say we provide the dark background
06:57 - color that is black this time so when we
06:59 - save this file so as you can see the
07:01 - background color of the circle is black
07:03 - in color and the icons are displayed as
07:05 - white in color now guys apart from this
07:07 - we will also have to provide certain
07:09 - spacing in between all the links so let
07:11 - us provide the margin for all the links
07:14 - over here so we simply have to provide
07:15 - the margin CSS property and let's say we
07:18 - provide 10 pixels of space from all the
07:20 - sides so when we save this file now as
07:22 - you can see all the icons are now
07:24 - separated with certain space in between
07:26 - them now guys instead of giving the
07:28 - black color as the background color
07:29 - color over here we need to provide the
07:31 - colors that are actually present on
07:33 - these websites of the social media icons
07:36 - so what we will do is simply we will
07:37 - comment out this line of cod that is
07:39 - background color over here and we will
07:41 - provide the inline style property in
07:43 - this case so basically inside the a tag
07:46 - which is having the class link over here
07:48 - since all the links will be having
07:49 - different background colors so we are
07:51 - going to provide the style attribute in
07:53 - this case and let us provide the
07:55 - background color CSS property and the
07:57 - Facebook social media icon is having
07:59 - some version of blue color over here so
08:01 - let us set that as well so this version
08:03 - of Blue we have set already so let me
08:05 - just save this file now and you can see
08:07 - that Facebook is now having the blue
08:09 - color as the background color over here
08:11 - the other icons are not visible right
08:13 - now because their color is white in
08:15 - color and the background color is also
08:17 - white in color for now so guys let us
08:19 - set the background color for the other
08:21 - social media icons as well so I'll
08:23 - quickly make the changes over here so as
08:24 - you can see we have provided the
08:26 - background colors for all the links over
08:28 - here apart from this for the social
08:30 - media icons at is Instagram and Snapchat
08:32 - we have provided the icon color as black
08:35 - so that it matches well with the light
08:37 - color background over here so let me
08:39 - just save this file now and when we see
08:41 - this page on the web browser as you can
08:42 - see this is the way that the icons are
08:44 - getting displayed over here which is
08:46 - giving it a decent look after we have
08:48 - provided the background colors for the
08:50 - icons and having the background as a
08:52 - circular shape now guys when we hover
08:54 - over this particular social icons we
08:56 - want to scale the icons to some extent
08:59 - what we will do is simply inside the
09:01 - style. CSS file over here let me just
09:03 - provide the link class in this case and
09:06 - then we will provide the hover sudo
09:08 - class over here and simply we will say
09:10 - transform in this case and then we will
09:12 - say scale by 1.2 that is the measure by
09:16 - which we want to scale the icon let me
09:18 - just save this file now and now when we
09:20 - get the mouse cursor over here as you
09:22 - can see the social media icons are
09:24 - increasing its size along with the
09:26 - background over here now if we want the
09:28 - smooth transition
09:29 - what we will do is simply inside the
09:31 - link class over here we will provide
09:33 - transition it is equal to all so that
09:36 - whatever changes happen to the link
09:38 - class all of them will have the
09:40 - transition and then apart from this we
09:41 - will have to provide certain timing so
09:43 - let's say we want 0.5 seconds during
09:46 - which the transition will complete so
09:48 - let me just save this file now and now
09:50 - if you see the transition as you can see
09:52 - it is a smooth transition which is
09:54 - helping the icon to increase its size
09:56 - along with the background that we have
09:57 - provided so guys in this way we can
09:59 - create the horizontal social media icons
10:02 - that can help the users in order to
10:04 - share your link on the different social
10:06 - platforms that they are using now guys
10:08 - apart from this since we have provided
10:10 - the display it is equal to flex value
10:13 - and by default the flex direction is
10:15 - horizontal in this case that is the row
10:17 - Direction over here if you want the
10:19 - social media icons to be displayed in
10:21 - the vertical Direction simply what you
10:23 - have to do is inside the container after
10:25 - display is equal to flex you can provide
10:28 - Flex Direction Over here by default it
10:30 - is row but this time we can make it as
10:32 - column so that all the items are getting
10:35 - displayed in the vertical Direction so
10:37 - when we save this file now and view this
10:39 - page on the web browser as you can see
10:41 - these are the social media icons that
10:42 - are getting displayed in the vertical
10:44 - Direction over here so guys in this way
10:46 - you can change the direction of the
10:48 - icons that are getting displayed based
10:50 - on your project requirements so guys
