00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to print inverted half
00:06 - pyramid pattern so guys this is the
00:08 - inverted half pyramid pattern as you can
00:11 - see there are five number of rows over
00:13 - here and the first row it is having five
00:15 - stars and Then followed by we have four
00:17 - stars and then we have three and then
00:19 - two and then in the end we have one star
00:22 - over here so guys this is the inverted
00:24 - half pyramid pattern that we are going
00:26 - to print using the Python program now
00:29 - guys what is the algorithm for pattern
00:31 - programs basically each pattern program
00:33 - has two or more than two Loops the
00:36 - number of the loop depends on the
00:37 - complexity of the pattern or the logic
00:40 - so this we are going to check with the
00:41 - help of examples as well the first for
00:44 - Loop works for the row and the second
00:46 - for Loop works for the column so guys
00:48 - this is very important and this we are
00:50 - going to implement using the Python
00:52 - program in vs code so guys over here
00:55 - what we will be doing is first of all we
00:57 - will take the number of rows from the
00:59 - user so we will name the variable as
01:01 - rows it is equal to n and then inside
01:04 - this we will be using the input function
01:07 - so basically we will provide the label
01:09 - as enter number of rows over here so
01:14 - guys whatever input user is providing it
01:16 - will be of the string data type we are
01:18 - converting the string data type to the
01:20 - integer by using this into function over
01:22 - here and it will be stored in this rows
01:25 - variable now guys what we have to do is
01:27 - simply we can use the for Loops in order
01:29 - to print the inverted half pyramid
01:31 - pattern so over here we will be using
01:34 - the for I in range now this range it
01:38 - will go from 0 up to rows so over here
01:41 - we say 0 comma rows because that many
01:43 - number of rows we need to print and then
01:46 - after this we have colon and then we can
01:49 - have the nested for Loop over here this
01:51 - time so for J in range so guys the very
01:55 - first row is having five number of rows
01:57 - over here as you can see so 5 times we
02:00 - need to print the star characters over
02:02 - here so what will be the value 5
02:04 - initially basically the rows is having
02:07 - the number that is 5 initially so again
02:09 - it will go from 0 up to row minus I this
02:14 - time so guys what we are doing exactly
02:16 - is initially the value of I is 0 so what
02:19 - will be the value of J it will be in the
02:21 - range from 0 up to rows minus I so rows
02:25 - is 5 minus I which is 0 so 5 minus 0 is
02:29 - 5 in this case so it will go from 0 up
02:32 - to 4 so basically initially only 5 Star
02:35 - characters will be printed when we
02:37 - provide the rows number as 5 in this
02:39 - case then next time the value of I will
02:41 - increment so basically our number of
02:44 - characters should decrease in this case
02:46 - because on the next line we have four
02:48 - number of characters and then next time
02:50 - we have three number of star characters
02:52 - and so on so similarly what we have done
02:55 - is we have done rows minus I so with the
02:57 - increase in the value of I the the
03:00 - second parameter over here will decrease
03:02 - and the number of star characters that
03:04 - are printed will also decrease over here
03:06 - so guys after this colon we can simply
03:09 - provide the print statement and inside
03:11 - this we can say star followed by a space
03:13 - character because all the star
03:15 - characters are separated by these base
03:17 - characters over here and then guys we
03:19 - don't want to go to the next line until
03:21 - we finish the entire row so over here we
03:24 - provide comma and the end parameter will
03:27 - have a blank character over here so that
03:30 - the control flow doesn't go to the next
03:32 - line when the control flow is within
03:34 - this inner for Loop now guys what we
03:36 - have to do is once the control flow
03:37 - comes out of this nested for Loop we
03:40 - have to provide a print statement so
03:42 - that the control flow goes to the next
03:45 - line in order to print the remaining
03:47 - four star characters and then next time
03:49 - it will also come to the new line again
03:51 - and it will print the three star
03:53 - characters and so on so guys basically
03:55 - this is the print function that we have
03:58 - provided over here just to do that that
04:00 - is in order to come to the next line
04:02 - okay this is the program that will help
04:04 - us in order to print the inverted half
04:06 - pyramid star pattern let me just save
04:08 - this file now and try running this code
04:10 - so it is asking to enter the number of
04:12 - rows let us provide 5 as the number of
04:14 - rows over here when we press enter as
04:17 - you can see this is the inverted half
04:19 - pyramid star pattern that we have got
04:21 - the first row is having five number of
04:23 - star characters then there are four star
04:25 - characters then we have three and then
04:28 - two and then one guys let us run this
04:30 - code once again this time we will
04:31 - provide the number of rows as 10 so when
04:34 - we press enter as you can see we have
04:35 - got another inverted half pyramid star
04:38 - pattern over here which is having 10
04:40 - number of rows the first row is having
04:42 - 10 stars and then the second row is
04:44 - having Nine Stars and then so on the
04:47 - number of star characters are decreasing
04:49 - with the increase in the number of rows
04:51 - so guys this is the way that we can
04:52 - easily print the inverted half pyramid
04:55 - star pattern over here please make sure
04:57 - that you practice on your own so that on
04:58 - different inputs you get different and
05:00 - outputs make sure that you like this
05:02 - video so that it reaches to more people
05:04 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
05:06 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
05:08 - as well the next video that we are going
05:10 - to talk about is Python program to print
