00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to print the Fibonacci
00:06 - sequence using recursion so guys in the
00:08 - previous program we have seen how we can
00:10 - write the Fibonacci series using the for
00:12 - Loop but in this particular program we
00:14 - are going to see how we can write the
00:16 - sequence as you can see this is the
00:18 - integer sequence that is it starts from
00:20 - 0 and then the next integer is 1 and
00:22 - then the addition of the previous two
00:24 - integers that is 0 and 1 it is 1 and
00:26 - then the next two integers that is one
00:28 - plus one it is equal to 2 and so on we
00:31 - have to find the next term in the
00:33 - Fibonacci sequence so basically we are
00:35 - going to achieve this task using
00:37 - recursive call in this program now the
00:39 - first two terms are 0 and 1 which are
00:41 - fixed and then all other terms are
00:43 - obtained by adding the preceding two
00:45 - terms this means to say the nth term is
00:48 - the sum of N minus 1 and the N minus two
00:50 - terms so guys let us check this with the
00:52 - help of the Python program over here in
00:54 - the vs code so the very first thing that
00:56 - we will do is we will ask the user in
00:59 - order to enter the number of terms it is
01:01 - required to be printed in the Fibonacci
01:04 - sequence so over here we will take the
01:06 - input as the function and then we will
01:08 - ask the user to enter dream number of
01:12 - terms in Fibonacci Sequence so guys over
01:16 - here the user will provide the number of
01:18 - terms to be displayed in the Fibonacci
01:20 - sequence now this input will take the
01:22 - string data type by default we need to
01:24 - convert it into the integer so we will
01:26 - just prefix the int function in order to
01:29 - convert the string into the integer data
01:31 - type now guys what we can do is we have
01:34 - to go through the for Loop and with each
01:36 - iteration we have to call the Fibonacci
01:38 - recursive call so guys over here we will
01:40 - be having the for low and then we say I
01:43 - and then we have n and then range it
01:45 - goes from 0 up to the terms it is
01:48 - entered by the user plus 1 since we need
01:51 - to include the terms as well we have to
01:53 - provide the plus 1 over here so that the
01:55 - last integer is not considered guys
01:57 - remember that inside the range inside
01:59 - the second pair parameter that is the
02:01 - maximum limit this number will not be
02:03 - considered whenever we are iterating
02:04 - through the for Loop and then guys we
02:06 - can simply call the recursive function
02:08 - that is the Fibonacci function which we
02:10 - are going to Define so guys over here we
02:12 - will be having the fibonacai call and we
02:14 - will be passing this integer that is I
02:17 - over here so basically what will happen
02:18 - is this function should be called so
02:21 - what we will do is we will Define this
02:22 - function over here so we will use def
02:24 - keyword followed by the name of the
02:26 - function and with this function we have
02:29 - to provide this parameter which is going
02:31 - to be passed from this for Loop and then
02:33 - guys over here what we have to do is we
02:35 - have to check if this number if it is
02:37 - less than or equal to 1 so if I is less
02:40 - than or equal to 1 which means either it
02:43 - will be 0 or 1 we are going to check for
02:45 - the positive integers only then what we
02:47 - have to do is we have to return this
02:49 - value that is I so basically if the
02:51 - number of term is 1 so this condition
02:53 - will satisfy and 1 will be returned and
02:56 - if it is greater than 1 then what we
02:58 - have to do is we have to come inside the
02:59 - the as part and over here we have to
03:02 - call this function again so Fibonacci
03:04 - this time but over here while passing
03:07 - the parameter we have to do I minus 1
03:09 - this time and then plus again we have to
03:12 - call the Fibonacci function and this
03:14 - time it needs to be I minus 2 so guys
03:16 - remember that the next term in the
03:18 - Fibonacci sequence it is the sum of the
03:20 - previous two terms which means if I is
03:22 - at the second position then we need to
03:24 - get I minus 1 and I minus 2 and add both
03:28 - these terms over here that is what we
03:29 - are doing with this particular
03:31 - expression and then guys what we can
03:33 - simply do is while calling this function
03:34 - we can simply print the return value
03:37 - that we are getting from the Fibonacci
03:39 - function over here so basically we have
03:41 - provided the print function and then
03:43 - inside this we have provided the
03:44 - recursive call to this Fibonacci
03:46 - function over here so guys let me just
03:48 - save this file now and try running this
03:50 - code so as you can see user is being
03:52 - asked to enter the number of terms in
03:54 - the Fibonacci sequence so let's say we
03:56 - provide the number of terms as 4 over
03:58 - here when we press enter we are getting
04:00 - a runtime exception guys over here
04:02 - that's because we have not provided the
04:04 - return keyword so we have to provide the
04:06 - return keyword over here let me just
04:08 - save this file now and try running this
04:10 - code once again if it works perfectly so
04:12 - let us put four once again as the number
04:14 - of terms in the Fibonacci sequence so
04:16 - guys as you can see we are getting all
04:18 - the terms over here inside the Fibonacci
04:20 - series that is 0 and then one and then
04:22 - we have one which is the sum of one plus
04:24 - zero then we have one plus one it is
04:26 - equal to two and then 2 plus 1 it is
04:28 - equal to three so guys over here we are
04:30 - getting the five terms so if we remove
04:32 - this terms plus one and replace it with
04:35 - just terms so let me just save this file
04:37 - now and running this code once again we
04:39 - will take 10 number of terms this time
04:41 - and when we press enter as you can see
04:43 - we are getting all the 10 terms over
04:45 - here let me just expand this section so
04:47 - as you can see we are getting 0 and then
04:48 - one and then we have one again then one
04:51 - plus one two then two plus one it is
04:53 - three three plus two is five five plus
04:55 - three is eight eight plus five is
04:57 - thirteen and so on we are getting all
04:59 - the terms over here so guys total 10
05:01 - number of terms we are getting in this
05:03 - Fibonacci Sequence so guys this is the
05:05 - way that we can easily display the
05:07 - Fibonacci sequence using the recursive
05:10 - call over here by just defining this
05:12 - Fibonacci function and these are the
05:14 - lines of code that we are supposed to
05:16 - write in order to display all the
05:18 - elements inside the Fibonacci series so
05:20 - guys please practice on your own so that
05:22 - on different inputs you get different
05:23 - outputs make sure that you like this
05:25 - video so that it reaches to more people
05:27 - and subscribe to this channel so that
05:29 - you get the notifications on upcoming
05:31 - videos as well the next video that we
05:33 - are going to talk about is Python
05:34 - program to check Armstrong number so
05:37 - stay tuned
