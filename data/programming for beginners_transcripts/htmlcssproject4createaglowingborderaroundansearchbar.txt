00:00 - so now we are going to create a search
00:01 - bar that will have a glowing effect when
00:03 - the user clicks on this particular
00:05 - search bar over here so as you can see
00:08 - we have the Border color and also the
00:10 - Box Shadow CSS property has been
00:12 - implemented over here in order to
00:14 - provide the glowing effect for this
00:16 - particular search box so let us move to
00:18 - the vs code so first of all we will
00:20 - create another folder inside this HTML
00:23 - CSS projects so basically we will say
00:26 - glowing search bar over here so guys we
00:28 - have this folder name inside which we
00:30 - are going to create two more files that
00:32 - is index.html and the style. CSS files
00:36 - so guys we have the index.html file over
00:38 - here and the other file that is style.
00:41 - CSS that will help us to provide the CSS
00:44 - properties now guys inside this
00:45 - index.html file we are going to create
00:48 - the HTML elements so let us provide the
00:51 - title of this particular web page so
00:53 - basically we are going to say glowing
00:56 - search bar in this case and then after
00:59 - this we are going to to link the style.
01:01 - CSS file with the help of this link tag
01:04 - over here and the RL attribute will be
01:07 - Styles sheet and the HTF attribute will
01:10 - be style. CSS file now guys inside the
01:12 - body tag what we are going to do is let
01:15 - us first of all have the div tag with
01:16 - the class container over here inside
01:19 - which we are going to define the input
01:21 - with the type search in this case so
01:23 - guys basically this is the input with
01:25 - the type search that will help us in
01:27 - order to create a search bar so we have
01:29 - we are going to have the value as search
01:31 - for the name and the ID attribute over
01:34 - here and apart from this we are also
01:36 - going to provide the placeholder for
01:38 - this input field and we will provide the
01:40 - value as for your search so guys
01:43 - basically this is the placeholder text
01:45 - that will be displayed inside the search
01:47 - bar let me just save this file now and
01:49 - let us open the live server in this case
01:51 - with the help of the co live button that
01:54 - you can see so guys basically this is
01:55 - the search bar that we have created now
01:58 - guys let us provide certain CSS
02:00 - properties for the search bar and the
02:02 - container class as well which is
02:04 - represented by the diff tag over here so
02:07 - first of all we will have the container
02:09 - class in this case and also we will have
02:11 - certain background color so let's say we
02:13 - have the white version of the background
02:15 - color over here so simply we are going
02:17 - to provide the white color in this case
02:19 - and let us have this particular shade of
02:22 - white color over here let me just save
02:24 - this file now as you can see this is the
02:26 - shade of the white color it is a kind of
02:28 - grayish color that is set as the
02:30 - background color for the container we
02:32 - will also have certain padding over here
02:34 - so let's see we have a padding of 20
02:36 - pixels and also we will set the text
02:39 - align as Center so that we can see the
02:41 - search bar at the center of this
02:43 - particular container so as you can see
02:45 - this is the search bar that is getting
02:47 - displayed over here now guys what we
02:49 - want to do is when the user gets the
02:51 - mouse cursor over here inside the search
02:53 - bar and clicks on it we want to have a
02:56 - glowing effect outside of this
02:58 - particular border of the search bar so
03:01 - simply we are going to provide certain
03:03 - CSS properties to this search bar first
03:05 - of all so we will use the ID that is
03:07 - search in this case so we have to use
03:10 - the hash character followed by search
03:12 - over here so basically we are going to
03:14 - increase the padding so let's say we
03:16 - provide the padding of five pixels over
03:18 - here so as you can see there is certain
03:20 - spacing that is provided inside the
03:22 - search bar over here now guys when we
03:24 - get the mouse cursor over here we need
03:26 - to make use of the focus Cudo class in
03:29 - this case so simply I'm going to copy
03:31 - paste this line of code over here we are
03:33 - going to remove this padding CSS
03:35 - property and we will say Focus that is
03:37 - the Udo class with the help of this
03:40 - colon over here and then after this we
03:42 - need to make the Border color so let's
03:45 - say we have the border of two pixels and
03:47 - it is of the type solid and we will
03:49 - provide some Blue version of the Border
03:51 - color over here so simply we are going
03:53 - to provide a blue color in this case and
03:56 - let us change the color to light blue
03:58 - over here and let's say this is the
04:00 - color that we want to have as the border
04:03 - so let me just save this file now and
04:04 - now when we get the mouse cursor over
04:06 - here you will not be able to see any
04:08 - changes over here that's because there
04:09 - is a default outline that is getting
04:11 - displayed right now so guys what we can
04:13 - do is simply we can provide outline it
04:16 - is equal to none in this case when we
04:18 - save this file now as you can see there
04:20 - is a blue color border that is getting
04:22 - displayed over here right now let us
04:24 - change the background color of this
04:25 - container to some darker version so
04:27 - let's say we have the black color for
04:29 - this background color over here so that
04:31 - we can properly see the Border color of
04:34 - this particular search bar so when we
04:36 - save this file now there is no change
04:38 - right now so as you can see we have not
04:40 - provided the semicolon over here so guys
04:42 - it is very important that we provide the
04:44 - semicolon after the values of the CSS
04:46 - properties so as you can see now we have
04:49 - the Border color that is light blue
04:51 - color for this particular search bar now
04:54 - guys what we can do is simply we can
04:56 - also provide the Box Shadow over here
04:58 - with the same color so we are going to
05:00 - provide the Box shadow of let's say 0
05:02 - pixels horizontal and the vertical
05:04 - shadow in this case and let's say we
05:06 - provide 20 pixels of the same color as
05:09 - the blur effect for the Box Shadow so
05:12 - I'll just copy paste this particular RGB
05:14 - color over here let me just save this
05:16 - file now and now when we get the mouse
05:19 - cursor inside this particular search bar
05:21 - and click on it you can see that there
05:23 - is a glowing effect that can be seen
05:25 - over here due to this box Shadow and the
05:28 - border that we have provided in this
05:30 - case for this particular search bar so
05:32 - guys in this way you can provide the
05:34 - glowing effect for the search bar with
05:36 - the help of these CSS properties apart
05:39 - from this we can also have the Border
05:41 - radius as well so let's say we have the
05:43 - radius of 10 pixels so you can see that
05:45 - there's a radius that is getting
05:47 - provided over here and when we click on
05:49 - the search bar you can see that there is
05:51 - a glowing effect that can be seen over
05:53 - here so guys comment in the comment
