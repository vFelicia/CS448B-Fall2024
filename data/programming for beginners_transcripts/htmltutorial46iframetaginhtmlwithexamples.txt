00:00 - so now we will see iframe in HTML so
00:03 - guys basically an HTML if frame is used
00:06 - to display a web page within another web
00:09 - page so we are going to check this with
00:10 - the help of example as well how we can
00:13 - display a web page inside the already
00:15 - existing web page now guys the HTML
00:18 - iframe tag specifies an inline frame so
00:21 - basically whatever HTML element we have
00:24 - written in our code besides that HTML
00:26 - element the inline if frame will be
00:28 - displayed with the help of the if frame
00:30 - tag over here in HTML an inline iframe
00:34 - is used to embed another document within
00:37 - the current HTML document so let us
00:39 - check the example and along with it we
00:41 - are going to use the SRC which is the
00:43 - source attribute that is used to refer
00:46 - to another web page to display an i
00:49 - frame so guys let us move to the vs code
00:51 - over here and first of all we will
00:53 - change the title to iframe in HTML so we
00:56 - will say iframe in HTML now guys we will
00:59 - have a very simple paragraph So by using
01:01 - the P tag we will say below is an i
01:05 - frame element so guys over here we have
01:08 - a very simple statement that is below is
01:10 - an iframe element inside the paragraph
01:13 - now guys we will provide the if frame
01:15 - over here so basically when we type
01:17 - iframe as you can see this is the tag
01:19 - that we are going to use so this is the
01:22 - SRC attribute that we can use in order
01:24 - to provide which web page we want to
01:27 - display inside this iframe element now
01:30 - this another attribute that is frame
01:31 - border we can remove it for now and guys
01:34 - before defining it we need to have
01:36 - another web page over here so let me
01:38 - just go to the Explorer so as you can
01:40 - see we only have the test.html page over
01:43 - here so what we can do is we can add a
01:46 - new file in this case so we click on
01:48 - this new file option and then we will
01:50 - say iframe do HTML in this case so guys
01:54 - basically we will be creating another
01:57 - web page over here which will be used in
01:59 - order to display it inside the I frame
02:01 - so guys let us provide the HTML 5 tag
02:05 - over here so automatically we will get
02:07 - the boiler plate code with the help of
02:09 - the vs code special feature over here so
02:12 - guys inside this we will have a very
02:14 - simple paragraph and we will say this is
02:17 - an iframe web page so guys basically we
02:21 - are displaying the simple statement that
02:23 - is this is an iframe web page so that we
02:26 - come to know that this is the web page
02:28 - that is created to displayed inside the
02:31 - if frame so guys let me just save this
02:32 - file now and move to the other file that
02:34 - is test.html so guys as you can see we
02:37 - can switch between the different HTML
02:40 - web pages over here by using these tabs
02:43 - on the vs code so this is the if frame.
02:45 - HTML file and we are going to test.html
02:48 - file now guys we can refer to this if
02:51 - frame. HTML that we have just created so
02:55 - inside the source attribute and inside
02:57 - the double codes we can simply provide
02:59 - if frame. HTML so this is the page that
03:02 - we want to display inside the iframe tag
03:05 - over here inside the test. HTML so guys
03:08 - let me just save this file now and try
03:10 - reloading this page on the browser so as
03:13 - you can see we will be using the test.
03:15 - HTML this time so when we refresh this
03:17 - page as you can see this is an if frame
03:20 - web page over here that is being
03:21 - displayed right now and guys you can see
03:24 - the border of the iframe as well which
03:26 - is the default CSS property that is
03:28 - applied to the iframe on this web page
03:31 - guys to make it more clear we can
03:32 - provide the background color as well to
03:34 - the if frame. HTML web page so what we
03:37 - will do is we will come to this if
03:39 - frame. HTML back page over here and
03:42 - inside the head section we will Define
03:44 - the style and for the body tag we are
03:46 - going to display the background color so
03:49 - that we can easily know what are the
03:51 - boundaries of the iframe element inside
03:53 - the test.html so guys over here let's
03:56 - say we provide the aqua color as the
03:58 - background color for the entire iframe
04:01 - web page so let me just save this file
04:03 - now and come to the test.html and then
04:05 - this time when we reload this page as
04:07 - you can see this is the dimension of the
04:09 - if frame over here and we are getting to
04:12 - see this is an iframe web page now if
04:14 - you notice this is another web page and
04:16 - it is an independent web page over here
04:18 - if we go to the file explorer and as you
04:21 - can see this is the iframe HTML file
04:24 - that is created so when we double click
04:26 - on this this particular if frame. HTML
04:29 - web page is being opened for you in
04:31 - another tab so guys this particular web
04:34 - page is being displayed in a small I
04:36 - frame over here inside the test.html
04:39 - page and that is the main purpose of
04:41 - this iframe element that is to display
04:44 - another web page inside the existing web
04:46 - page now guys apart from this it is very
04:48 - important that we also provide the title
04:51 - attribute which is used by screen
04:53 - readers to read out what the content of
04:55 - the iframe is so basically we come to
04:58 - this test.html
05:00 - and inside this if frame tag after the
05:02 - source attribute we provide the title
05:05 - attribute as well and then we say test
05:08 - if frame over here so guys basically
05:10 - whatever title we give inside this
05:12 - double codes it will be used by the
05:15 - screen readers in order to read the
05:17 - content of this title attribute so no
05:20 - change will be seen over here so when we
05:22 - just save this file now and try
05:23 - reloading this page once again on the
05:25 - browser there is no change when we
05:27 - provide the title attribute but it will
05:29 - used by the screen readers whenever they
05:31 - are going to read the iframe content now
05:34 - guys apart from this you can also use
05:36 - the height and width attributes of the I
05:38 - frame so basically this is the default
05:41 - width and height that we have set so far
05:43 - over here we can explicitly set the
05:45 - width and height of the I frame in this
05:47 - case so after the title let me just
05:49 - provide the height of the I frame as 100
05:52 - pixels over here so we provide 100
05:54 - pixels and as well as the width as 100
05:57 - pixels in this case so since the width
05:59 - and height height are same the if frame
06:00 - will be displayed as a square if frame
06:02 - over here let me just save this file now
06:04 - and try reloading this page so as you
06:07 - can see it is a square I frame in this
06:09 - case guys we can increase the width and
06:11 - height over here so we will keep it as
06:13 - 300 pixels so it looks more decent over
06:16 - here so as you can see this is a square
06:18 - I frame in this case and that is how you
06:20 - can easily set the width and height of
06:22 - the I frame you can also use the CSS
06:25 - properties as well inside which you can
06:28 - provide the height and width properties
06:30 - when you are providing the style
06:31 - attribute for that I frame now guys by
06:34 - default the border of the I frame is
06:36 - being displayed so as you can see this
06:38 - is the gray border for the I frame so
06:40 - what we can do is we can remove the
06:42 - Border as well so simply we have to come
06:44 - over here and inside the style attribute
06:47 - in this case we provide the Border
06:50 - property and then for this border
06:51 - property we provide the value as none so
06:54 - guys what is the meaning of none value
06:56 - for the Border property it means there
06:58 - will be no border at at all for this
07:00 - particular iframe HTML element so let me
07:03 - just save this file now and try
07:04 - reloading this page once again on the
07:06 - browser as you can see there is no
07:08 - border right now and it simply looks
07:10 - like it is some another element which is
07:12 - having a background color property and
07:15 - guys apart from this we can also have
07:16 - the border that is specified so simply
07:18 - we can provide two pixels over here and
07:20 - then solid and black color so guys
07:23 - basically we are providing the two
07:25 - pixels width of the border and it is a
07:27 - solid border and the color of the Border
07:29 - will be black over here let me just save
07:31 - this file now and try reloading this
07:33 - page so as you can see the border is
07:35 - being applied to this iframe element now
07:37 - now guys apart from this we can also
07:39 - have the iframe target for a link so
07:42 - what this means is we can also have the
07:44 - anchor tag over here so what we will be
07:47 - doing is we will Define the anchor tag
07:49 - and after clicking on that particular
07:51 - link that is the hyperlink that is being
07:53 - defined by the anchor tag the content of
07:56 - the iframe element will be updated so
07:59 - guys for this we will have another
08:01 - iframe page over here so what we will do
08:03 - is I will have another iframe HTML page
08:07 - so this time we will say iframe 1. HTML
08:10 - now guys inside this file we will again
08:12 - have the HTML code and again we will
08:14 - have the paragraph tag over here and
08:17 - then we will say this is another I frame
08:21 - but guys this time what we will do is we
08:22 - will have the background color of this
08:25 - page as yellow so we will provide the
08:27 - style tag inside the head tag over here
08:29 - and then for the body tag in this case
08:32 - we will provide the background color
08:34 - over here and the background color will
08:35 - be yellow in this case so guys let me
08:38 - just save this file now I'll show you
08:39 - this file that is being created that is
08:41 - if frame 1 over here so when we click on
08:43 - this this is the if frame one that is
08:45 - being created and we can independently
08:48 - view all these files over here I'll
08:50 - simply close these files now guys what
08:52 - we will do is by default the first I
08:54 - frame that we defined will be displayed
08:56 - over here but when we are going to click
08:58 - on a particular l link the content of
09:00 - this if frame should change to the
09:02 - second I frame that we just defined with
09:04 - the yellow background color so what we
09:06 - are going to do is inside this test.html
09:09 - we will have a hyperlink over here so
09:11 - let's say we Define the a tag in this
09:13 - case and then we will have the content
09:15 - as click here so guys basically we are
09:18 - asking the user to click on this
09:20 - particular link and for the HF attribute
09:23 - we are going to point it to the iframe
09:25 - 1. HTML page that we just defined which
09:28 - is having the yellow background so guys
09:30 - over here iframe 1. HTML is being
09:33 - provided to the hdri attribute now guys
09:35 - by default what is the meaning of this
09:37 - so basically this iframe 1. HTML page
09:41 - will be displayed on the same page where
09:43 - this test.html page is being displayed
09:46 - right now so guys let me just show you
09:48 - that so I'll save this file now and try
09:50 - reloading this page once again on the
09:52 - browser so as you can see since the
09:54 - iframe element is the inline element the
09:57 - anchor tag is being displayed over here
09:59 - here to the right of this particular
10:00 - element and when we click on this
10:02 - particular link over here since we have
10:04 - given the hdf attribute as if frame 1.
10:07 - HTML this page will be opened in this
10:10 - same tab so when I click on this as you
10:12 - can see this is another if frame so
10:14 - iframe 1. HTML is getting loaded over
10:17 - here but guys what we want to do is when
10:20 - we click on this link we want to open
10:22 - that page inside this iframe so how we
10:25 - can achieve that so basically what we
10:27 - have to do is first of all we need to
10:29 - provide the name to this iframe over
10:31 - here so let's say we provide the name
10:34 - attribute in this case and we simply say
10:37 - high frame over here as the name of this
10:40 - particular HTML element now guys we need
10:42 - to refer to this name when we click on
10:45 - this particular link and that can be
10:47 - done by providing the target attribute
10:49 - so guys if you remember the target
10:51 - attribute is used in order to open this
10:54 - particular web page in the same browser
10:57 - tab or the different browser tab so when
10:59 - we provide the blank value over here
11:02 - this particular page will be opened on a
11:04 - different browser Tab and by default the
11:06 - value is self right now which is making
11:09 - it open in the same browser tab but what
11:11 - we want is we want to open it in this
11:13 - particular iframe so we simply copy the
11:15 - name of this I frame and paste it to the
11:19 - Target attribute of the a tag over here
11:22 - now guys let me just save this file now
11:24 - and try reloading this page once again
11:26 - on the browser now guys when we click on
11:28 - this particular link the if frame with
11:30 - the yellow background should display in
11:33 - this particular I frame element so when
11:36 - I click over here as you can see this is
11:38 - another iframe is being displayed right
11:40 - now in the iframe element that was
11:43 - defined in the test.html element itself
11:46 - rather than opening this particular
11:48 - iframe 1. HTML in the same or different
11:51 - browser tab so guys this is another
11:54 - application wherein you can provide the
11:56 - target attribute as the name of the if
11:59 - frame for that particular hyperlink
12:01 - where you want to load a particular if
12:03 - frame inside the iframe HTML element so
