00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write a
00:04 - Python program to find sum of numbers
00:06 - entered by a user so guys we are going
00:08 - to see how a user can enter the number
00:10 - so as you can see user have entered two
00:12 - number over here that is 10 and 20 and
00:15 - the sum of these numbers that is entered
00:16 - by the user it is equal to 30. similarly
00:19 - we will ask the user to enter the count
00:21 - of the users that is 5 in this case for
00:24 - example and the numbers that is entered
00:26 - by the user are 10 20 up to 50 and we
00:30 - are going to see how we can find the sum
00:31 - of all these numbers and we are going to
00:33 - print the sum of all these numbers
00:35 - entered by the user so guys let us move
00:37 - to the vs code over here so first of all
00:39 - let us see how the user can enter two
00:42 - numbers so let's say first of all we
00:43 - provide number one as the variable one
00:45 - over here and what we will do is we will
00:48 - ask the user to provide the number input
00:50 - function and we can provide the label
00:52 - that is enter first number so guys over
00:55 - here the user will provide the first
00:56 - number but guys by default whatever
00:58 - input is given by the user it is
01:01 - considered as the string so we need to
01:03 - convert this string into the integer so
01:05 - you can also convert it into float as
01:07 - well but in this case we are going to
01:09 - provide the integer function and then
01:12 - provide the entire expression that is
01:14 - the input inside the open and close
01:15 - brackets over here so guys over here
01:17 - this input function is taking the number
01:19 - as the string and then this string is
01:21 - being converted into the integer and the
01:24 - value of that integer is getting stored
01:26 - in number one now guys similarly we will
01:28 - take number 2 as well so over here I'll
01:30 - simply copy this line of code and paste
01:32 - this over here and we will say number
01:34 - two in this case and over here we will
01:36 - change the label to Second so enter
01:39 - second number so similarly we will get
01:41 - the second number over here and then
01:43 - guys after taking both the numbers as
01:44 - the input what we can simply do is we
01:46 - can find the sum of both these numbers
01:48 - so we are going to have the print
01:50 - statement and we can simply have the
01:52 - label that is the sum of we will print
01:55 - both these numbers that is number one
01:57 - and number two using the dot format
01:59 - function over here here so the sum of
02:01 - first number and then we have the second
02:03 - number is and then colon and then we
02:06 - will have the sum so guys over here we
02:08 - are representing the number one using
02:10 - the open and close curly braces then we
02:13 - have number two followed by Sum over
02:15 - here so after this double quotes we can
02:17 - simply have dot followed by format over
02:19 - here we can simply provide these three
02:21 - arguments to the format so the first
02:23 - argument is number one in this case
02:26 - followed by we have number two and then
02:29 - separated by comma we have number one
02:31 - plus number two in this case since the
02:33 - third argument should be the sum so guys
02:36 - over here we are directly adding both
02:37 - the numbers that is number one and
02:39 - number two we can also have this
02:41 - expression in another variable which can
02:43 - be called as sum so which will be equal
02:45 - to sum it is equal to number one plus
02:48 - number two so guys over here we have
02:50 - just reduced the lines of Code by doing
02:52 - the sum in this print statement itself
02:55 - so let me just save this file now and
02:56 - try running this code so as you can see
02:58 - program is asking us enter first number
03:01 - so we are going to provide 10 as the
03:03 - first number and enter second number we
03:06 - are going to provide 20 as the second
03:07 - number let me press enter over here so
03:10 - as you can see the sum of 10 and 20 is
03:12 - 30. so we are getting the sum of both
03:14 - these numbers that are being entered by
03:16 - the user let me check another example
03:18 - we'll run this code once again so let's
03:20 - say we provide 50 as first number and
03:23 - let's say we provide 71 as the second
03:25 - number and when we press enter the sum
03:27 - of 50 and 71 is 121 so guys in this way
03:31 - we can easily add two numbers over here
03:33 - let me run this code once again so over
03:35 - here the first number let's say we
03:37 - provide 49 and then the second number
03:39 - let's say we provide 51 so guys what
03:41 - will be the sum of both these numbers
03:43 - you can comment below let us see whether
03:45 - your answer is correct or not now guys
03:47 - this is one way in order to add the two
03:49 - numbers but what if you have more than
03:51 - two numbers over here and you want to
03:53 - add let's say five numbers or 10 numbers
03:56 - and you don't know how many numbers you
03:58 - need to add dynamically so so what we
04:00 - can do is we can also ask the user to
04:03 - enter the count of numbers and then
04:05 - enter all those numbers before finding
04:07 - the sum in this case so guys let us move
04:09 - to the vs code over here basically we
04:11 - need to have the variable that is count
04:13 - of numbers so we will say count it is
04:15 - equal enter count of numbers in this
04:20 - case followed by colon and then guys
04:22 - since this will be a string we are going
04:24 - to convert it to the integer so over
04:26 - here we will provide the end function as
04:28 - the prefix so guys over here we will get
04:30 - the count as the integer now guys what
04:32 - we can do is we can use the for Loop
04:34 - over here so after providing the four
04:36 - keyword we can have the variable that is
04:39 - num in which the numbers will be stored
04:41 - and then we can provide n and Then
04:43 - followed by the range function so guys
04:45 - over here range function is responsible
04:47 - in order to get the numbers from 0 up to
04:51 - this count that we have already entered
04:53 - so over here what we have to provide is
04:55 - the parameter that is the count which is
04:58 - the maximum number that the range should
04:59 - go to so over here the basic
05:02 - functionality is the range will give us
05:04 - the numbers from 0 up to count -1 so
05:06 - let's say if the user enters the number
05:09 - five so range will return the numbers
05:11 - from 0 to 4 in this case and one at a
05:13 - time those numbers will be assigned to
05:15 - num in this case so basically the
05:17 - control flow will go inside this for
05:19 - Loop five times so inside this for Loop
05:22 - what we have to do is we have to ask the
05:25 - user the number so over here the number
05:27 - that will be entered by the user will be
05:29 - stored in this number variable and Then
05:31 - followed by we will have the end
05:33 - function inside this we will take the
05:35 - input so we have the input function in
05:37 - this case we can optionally have the
05:39 - label as well and if you don't provide
05:41 - any label we can simply provide those
05:43 - many numbers that we have provided the
05:45 - count of so guys over here after taking
05:47 - the input we can have another variable
05:50 - over here outside the for Loop and we
05:52 - will initialize the variable as 0 since
05:54 - this will store the sum of those numbers
05:56 - so sum it is equal to 0 we are going to
05:59 - initialize before the for Loop and
06:01 - inside the for Loop we are going to use
06:03 - that variable and the number that is
06:05 - being entered by the user over here to
06:07 - this sum so we can simply have sum it is
06:10 - equal to sum plus number in this case so
06:13 - guys what is happening is the first time
06:15 - some value is 0 so over here we have 0
06:17 - in this case so when the user enters the
06:20 - number over here whatever number it is
06:22 - that number will be added to 0 and it
06:24 - will be stored in this sum variable next
06:27 - time when the control flow comes back
06:28 - again and it asks the user to enter the
06:30 - number so that number will be added to
06:33 - the existing sum and so on at the end of
06:36 - the for Loop we will have the sum of all
06:38 - the numbers inside this sum variable now
06:40 - simply what we can do is we can print
06:43 - this some variable over here so we have
06:45 - the print statement and then we can
06:47 - simply have the label that is the sum of
06:50 - all numbers is and Then followed by
06:54 - colon and then we can simply provide
06:56 - this sum variable over here so guys this
06:58 - is the Python program in order to find
07:00 - the sum of the numbers that will be
07:02 - entered by the user so let me just save
07:04 - this file now and try running this code
07:06 - so over here let's say enter count of
07:08 - numbers we provide five numbers over
07:10 - here then we are supposed to provide
07:12 - five numbers so let's say first number
07:13 - is 10 and then we provide 20 and then 30
07:17 - 40 and then 50. now guys if you notice
07:20 - we have provided all the five numbers so
07:22 - next time the control flow will not go
07:24 - inside the for Loop but it will come out
07:26 - of the follow and it will print this
07:29 - statement including the sum of all these
07:31 - numbers so let me press enter over here
07:33 - as you can see the sum of all numbers is
07:35 - 150 so we are getting the sum of all
07:38 - these numbers that we have added one by
07:40 - one inside the for Loop using this
07:42 - statement guys let us take another
07:43 - example so let's say we run this code
07:45 - once again so over here let's say we
07:47 - provide this time the count of numbers
07:49 - as three so we have to provide three
07:52 - numbers so let's say first number is 50
07:54 - and let's say we provide 90 over here
07:56 - and then let's say we provide 40 essay
07:58 - number so when we press n enter now
08:00 - since we have already provided three
08:02 - numbers we should get the sum of all
08:04 - these numbers over here so once we press
08:06 - enter as you can see the sum of all
08:07 - numbers is 180 in this case so guys this
08:10 - is the way that we can write the Python
08:11 - program in order to find the sum of
08:13 - numbers please make sure that you
08:15 - practice on your own so that on
08:16 - different inputs you get different
08:18 - outputs make sure that you like this
08:19 - video so that it reaches to more people
08:21 - and subscribe to this channel so that
08:23 - you get the notifications on upcoming
08:25 - videos as well the next video that we
08:27 - are going to talk about is Python
08:28 - program to find square root of a number
08:30 - so stay tuned
