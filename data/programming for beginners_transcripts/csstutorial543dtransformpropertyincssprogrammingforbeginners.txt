00:00 - so now we will see 3D transform property
00:03 - in CSS so guys basically the CSS also
00:06 - supports 3D Transformations by
00:08 - specifying the Xs and this we are going
00:10 - to check with the help of examples as
00:12 - well we are going to see the different
00:14 - CSS functions that are used with the
00:16 - help of the transform property so guys
00:19 - over here we have something called as
00:20 - rotate X then we have rotate Y and
00:23 - rotate Zed as well so guys let us check
00:25 - this with the help of examples in vs
00:27 - code over here so simply I'm going to
00:29 - remove the previous lines of code that
00:31 - we had written we are going to write
00:33 - them once again so that you get the
00:35 - practice of writing the code in the HTML
00:37 - and CSS over here so guys simply we are
00:39 - going to have the div tag over here once
00:42 - again and for this div tag we are going
00:44 - to have fixed width and height so guys
00:46 - let's say we have the width as 150
00:49 - pixels over here and the same 150 pixels
00:52 - for the height attribute as well that is
00:54 - the height CSS property so guys over
00:57 - here we have width and height of 150
00:58 - pixels let us have the background color
01:01 - of aqua color this time so basically we
01:03 - have the aqua color is the background
01:05 - color for this particular diff tag which
01:07 - will be a square shaped diff tag over
01:10 - here and apart from this we will also
01:11 - have the Border CSS property the border
01:14 - withd is two pixels and the Border style
01:17 - is solid and the Border color is black
01:19 - color over here so guys let me just save
01:21 - this file now and try reloading this
01:23 - page once again on the browser so as you
01:25 - can see we have this Square shaped div
01:27 - element in this case guys apart from
01:29 - this let us get this square at the
01:31 - center of the screen so over here we
01:33 - will provide the margin as Auto for the
01:35 - left and right margin and for the top
01:38 - margin we will provide the 10% of margin
01:40 - in this case let me just save this file
01:42 - now and try reloading this page so as
01:44 - you can see to some extent we have got
01:46 - this square box at the center of the
01:48 - screen now guys let us see how this
01:50 - rotate X function will work with the
01:52 - help of the transform property so guys
01:55 - over here what we want to do is inside
01:57 - the style. CSS file when we get the curs
02:00 - on this particular diff tag we want to
02:02 - rotate it so let us check that how we
02:04 - can do it so basically we have to use
02:06 - the diff tag followed by colon and then
02:09 - we are going to use the hover sudo class
02:11 - over here and on Hover we are going to
02:14 - use the transform CSS property for which
02:16 - we are going to use the rotate function
02:18 - now guys previously we had seen the 2D
02:21 - transform properties which included
02:23 - rotate function over there but now we
02:25 - have the different rotate functions in
02:27 - terms of 3D transformation so we have so
02:30 - we have rotate X we have rotate Y and we
02:33 - have rotate Zed which is expecting
02:35 - certain angles over here so guys let us
02:37 - see how this rotate X will work so let
02:39 - us say we provide certain angle in this
02:42 - case so we provide 30° in this case so
02:45 - let me just save this file now and try
02:47 - reloading this page once again on the
02:49 - browser so as you can see this is the
02:51 - original position of the def tag and the
02:53 - moment we get the cursor on this
02:55 - particular diff tag the diff tag is
02:57 - rotating itself so basically we are
02:59 - seeing that the size of the diff tag is
03:01 - decreasing that is the height is
03:02 - decreasing over here but guys in reality
03:05 - the square box is rotating itself with
03:07 - the help of the x-axis over here so guys
03:10 - if you remember in the previous video we
03:12 - understood the x-axis and the Y AIS when
03:14 - we were learning the 2D transformation
03:17 - but this time we are going to learn 3D
03:19 - transformation over here so what exactly
03:21 - is happening in this case is so this was
03:24 - the screen that we had seen previously
03:26 - let us remove this and we are going to
03:28 - have the square that we had just drawn
03:30 - on the web browser so basically we have
03:32 - this square box that we have drawn on
03:35 - the web browser over here let me just
03:37 - change the color to some other color so
03:39 - let's say we have yellow color over here
03:41 - now guys what exactly is happening is
03:43 - when we say rotate X basically this is
03:45 - the x-axis in the horizontal Direction
03:48 - so when we are rotating this particular
03:50 - box with the help of the x-axis so the
03:53 - height of this particular diff tag is
03:55 - decreasing over here but basically in
03:57 - reality it is not decreasing but the box
04:00 - is rotating itself in this x-axis and
04:03 - that is why it is looking like the
04:05 - height is decreasing over here so guys
04:07 - in this way the rotate X will work that
04:09 - is the HTML element will rotate itself
04:12 - in the x-axis Direction now similarly
04:15 - when we use the Y AIS over here that is
04:17 - using the rotate y so you will see that
04:19 - the width of this particular square box
04:21 - will decrease to some extent when we use
04:23 - the rotate y so guys let us check that
04:25 - as well so over here we are going to say
04:28 - rotate y this this time and then let's
04:31 - say we use the same angle that is 30°
04:33 - over here so simply we provide 30 D that
04:36 - is the unit let me just save this file
04:38 - now and try reloading this page once
04:40 - again on the browser and when we get the
04:42 - cursor over here as you can see the
04:44 - square box is rotating itself with the
04:47 - help of the y- AIS this time and it
04:49 - looks like the width of this particular
04:51 - square box is decreasing but in reality
04:53 - it is rotating itself with the help of
04:55 - this y AIS over here so guys in this way
04:58 - the rotate X and rotate y will work now
05:00 - guys apart from this we also have
05:02 - something called as rotate Zed so how
05:04 - this will work so guys in 3D
05:06 - transformation we have another axis that
05:08 - is Zed AIS over here which is coming on
05:11 - top from the center over here so guys if
05:13 - I draw this particular Z axis it will
05:16 - look something like this over here and
05:17 - we draw the Z AIS so basically it will
05:20 - start from the center that is the origin
05:22 - and it will come on top so guys
05:24 - basically it will look something like
05:25 - this over here so this is the Zed AIS as
05:28 - far as the 3D transform is concerned so
05:31 - guys over here when we rotate in terms
05:33 - of Z AIS it will actually look like the
05:35 - square bracket is rotating itself as
05:38 - normal rotation so guys let us check
05:40 - this as well so basically what will
05:41 - happen is this Square will be displayed
05:44 - over here and in terms of Z AIS it will
05:46 - rotate itself in the clockwise Direction
05:49 - in this way so guys let us check this
05:51 - with the help of example over here so
05:53 - instead of rotate y we will say rotate
05:55 - Zed this time and then we will also
05:57 - provide 30° as the value over here so
06:00 - simply we are going to provide 30° let
06:03 - me just save this file now and try
06:04 - reloading this page and when we get the
06:06 - cursor over here on the square box that
06:08 - is a diff element as you can see it is
06:10 - rotating itself and 30° is the rotation
06:13 - so guys in this way the Zed XIs rotation
06:15 - will work it will look like it is
06:17 - actually rotating and that is how the
06:19 - Zed XIs rotation Works guys apart from
06:21 - this we also have the translate X and
06:24 - Translate Y and the translate Zed as
06:26 - well so let us check that as well with
06:28 - the help of examples over here simply we
06:30 - are going to provide translate X in this
06:33 - case and let's say we provide 100 pixels
06:35 - over here as the value so guys basically
06:38 - the square box should go on the right
06:40 - hand side by 100 pixels over here when
06:42 - we say translate X so let us check this
06:45 - as well let me reload this page once
06:47 - again on the browser and when we get the
06:49 - cursor on this diff tag as you can see
06:51 - the box is going on the right hand side
06:53 - by 100 pixels over here and this is how
06:55 - the translate X will work guys apart
06:58 - from this we also have something called
06:59 - let Translate Y so this time the square
07:02 - box should come down over here by 100
07:04 - pixels so let us check that as well so
07:07 - let me just save this file now and try
07:08 - reloading this page so when we get the
07:10 - cursor over here as you can see the box
07:12 - is coming down by 100 pixels and that is
07:15 - how the Translate Y will work based on
07:17 - the XIs that we have seen over here and
07:20 - then guys apart from this we also have
07:22 - something called as translate Zed as
07:24 - well so guys over here translate Zed
07:26 - will make the box to come on top by 100
07:29 - pixels so guys it will be on the same
07:31 - position if we are viewing it from top
07:34 - so let me just reload this page so if we
07:36 - get the cursor over here we won't be
07:39 - able to see any change right now but
07:41 - actually it is at the ground and from
07:43 - the ground it is coming at the height of
07:45 - 100 pixels over here on that same
07:48 - position because that is how the Z AIS
07:50 - will work as we have seen over here in
07:52 - this particular diagram so guys in this
07:54 - way you can provide the translate in all
07:57 - the exes as well and we can also provide
07:59 - the other functions related to scale as
08:01 - well so guys let us check this as well
08:03 - with the help of example over here so
08:05 - let us provide the scale X this time and
08:08 - we will provide 1.2 as the number by
08:11 - which the square box will increase its
08:14 - size with the help of xais so let me
08:16 - just save this file now and try
08:17 - reloading this page once again on the
08:19 - browser so when we get the cursor on
08:21 - this particular diff tag as you can see
08:23 - on the x-axis direction that is the
08:25 - width of this particular square box is
08:27 - increasing and now it is becoming
08:29 - rectangle so guys basically this diff
08:31 - tag is increasing its width with the
08:33 - help of the 1.2 value that we have given
08:36 - over here if we want to double the width
08:38 - then we can simply provide the value of
08:40 - two for the scale X function so let me
08:43 - just reload this page once again so as
08:45 - you can see this is the double width of
08:47 - the original width of the diff tag and
08:49 - then guys apart from this we can also
08:51 - provide the scale Y which will help us
08:53 - in order to increase the height over
08:55 - here when we reload this page as you can
08:57 - see it is increasing the height of the
08:59 - sff tag in terms of Y AIS over here and
09:02 - when we say scale Zed so let us check
09:04 - that as well so over here when we
09:06 - provide scale Zed this time so let me
09:08 - just save this file now and try
09:10 - reloading this page you won't be able to
09:12 - see any change that's because we are
09:13 - scaling it in the bottom to top
09:16 - Direction over here when we see the box
09:18 - from the top so guys basically this is
09:20 - the importance of the Zed axis that is
09:22 - the third axis as far as the 3D
09:24 - transformation is concerned and you can
09:26 - use all these CSS functions by using the
09:29 - transform CSS property based on your
09:31 - requirements so guys comment in the
