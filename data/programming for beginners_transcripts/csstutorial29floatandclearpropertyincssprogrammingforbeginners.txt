00:00 - so now we will see float and clear
00:02 - properties in CSS so guys basically the
00:05 - float property is used for positioning
00:08 - and formatting the content inside the
00:10 - HTML web page and this we are going to
00:13 - check with the help of examples as well
00:15 - so a very simple example as far as the
00:18 - usage of the float property is concerned
00:20 - is an example in order to let an image
00:23 - float left to the text in a container so
00:27 - guys basically we will create a
00:28 - container with the diff tag and inside
00:30 - the diff tag we will have the image that
00:33 - will be displayed either on the left or
00:35 - the right of the container and we will
00:37 - display the text accordingly besides the
00:40 - image which is present inside the
00:42 - container now guys the float property
00:44 - can have one of the following values so
00:46 - basically we will see the left value in
00:49 - which case the element floats to the
00:51 - left of its container when we use the
00:53 - right value the element floats to the
00:55 - right of its container and when the
00:57 - value is none the element does does not
01:00 - float it will be displayed just where it
01:02 - occurs in the text and this is the
01:05 - default behavior and when we use the
01:07 - inherit option basically the element
01:10 - inherits the float value from its parent
01:12 - tag over here now guys let us move to
01:14 - the BS code and I'll simply remove the
01:17 - previous lines of code that we had
01:18 - written in the HTML and the style. CSS
01:22 - files over here now guys in order to
01:24 - understand the example of the float
01:26 - property we will have the div tag with
01:28 - the class container over here so guys
01:31 - basically we will Define the diff tag
01:33 - with the class container and inside this
01:35 - let us say we have the image so simply
01:37 - we are going to provide the IMG tag over
01:40 - here and the SRC attribute will have the
01:43 - sample image.png file in this case which
01:46 - we already have in our directory over
01:48 - here now guys apart from this we will
01:50 - also have the alternate text T Test
01:53 - image in this case and then over here we
01:56 - will provide the width of 150 pixels and
01:59 - let's say the height of 100 pixels so
02:02 - that the image is properly displayed
02:04 - inside this container and then guys
02:06 - apart from this let us have some random
02:09 - text over here inside the container so
02:11 - we use the lurm Mt abbreviation over
02:14 - here so guys we have generated the
02:15 - random text as well let me just save
02:17 - this file now and let us see how this
02:19 - particular image and the text will be
02:22 - displayed inside the div tag with the
02:24 - class container on the web page so let
02:26 - me just reload this page over here on
02:28 - the browser so as you can see by default
02:31 - we don't have any float property that is
02:33 - provided in the CSS file and the float
02:35 - property is set to none and this is the
02:38 - way that the image is getting displayed
02:40 - over here inside the container and to
02:42 - the right of this particular image we
02:44 - are having the text that is the random
02:46 - text that we have generated now guys let
02:49 - us say we want this text to be displayed
02:52 - exactly to the right of this particular
02:54 - image and without wasting this
02:56 - particular space that you can see which
02:57 - is a blank space over here so what we
03:00 - can do is simply we can say that this
03:02 - particular image tag should have the
03:04 - float property as left so what we will
03:06 - do is over here in the style. CSS file
03:09 - we will say image tag in this case and
03:12 - over here we will say float property for
03:15 - which the value should be left in this
03:16 - case let me just save this file now and
03:18 - try reloading this page once again on
03:20 - the browser so now as you can see the
03:23 - image is set to the left of this
03:25 - particular div container over here let
03:28 - us provide certain border and the
03:29 - background color as well for the diff
03:31 - container so simply we are going to copy
03:34 - this class name and use it inside the
03:36 - style. CSS file so we use the dot
03:39 - character for the class name and then we
03:41 - will provide the CSS property so let's
03:43 - say we provide the background color as
03:46 - Aqua over here and also we will provide
03:48 - certain border as well so let's say we
03:50 - provide the border of two pixels which
03:52 - is of the type solid and the color is
03:55 - black so let me just save this file now
03:57 - and try reloading this page once again
03:59 - on on the browser so as you can see we
04:01 - have the image that is floating to the
04:03 - left of this particular container and
04:05 - the text is getting displayed to the
04:07 - right of this particular image and in
04:09 - this way we can easily use the float
04:11 - property in order to position a specific
04:14 - image or any other HTML element inside
04:17 - the container now guys let us say we
04:19 - want this particular image to be
04:20 - displayed on the right so what we can do
04:23 - is instead of providing the value as
04:25 - left we can simply say right over here
04:28 - so let me just save this file now and
04:29 - try reloading this page once again on
04:31 - the browser so as you can see we have
04:33 - the image that is getting displayed on
04:35 - the right of this container now let us
04:37 - provide certain padding as well to The
04:39 - Container so that it looks more decent
04:42 - so let me just provide the padding
04:44 - property of let's say five pixels in
04:47 - this case so let me just save this file
04:49 - now and try reloading this page once
04:51 - again so as you can see we have the five
04:52 - pixels padding that is being provided
04:54 - inside the container and in this way
04:57 - based on your project requirements you
04:58 - can use the float property over here now
05:01 - guys apart from this we also have the
05:03 - other value that is inherit in which
05:05 - case the image will inherit the float
05:08 - property from its parent so over here
05:10 - the parent is the diff tag in this case
05:13 - so guys let us check that as well so
05:15 - what we will do is let's say we provide
05:17 - the float property as inherit over here
05:20 - so by default the float property for the
05:22 - parent that is the container class is
05:24 - none in this case so the way the UI was
05:27 - displayed by default initially the same
05:29 - way the changes will be provided on the
05:32 - web page right now so let me just save
05:34 - this file now and try reloading this
05:36 - page once again on the browser so as you
05:38 - can see we have this particular image
05:40 - and the text is getting displayed on the
05:42 - right of the image but we still have the
05:44 - spaces on top of this text which we
05:46 - don't want to waste so guys what we can
05:48 - do is since we are inheriting the value
05:51 - of Lo over here and the parent of this
05:53 - image is the diff tag in this case which
05:56 - is having the class container we can
05:58 - provide the FL float property to this
06:01 - container as well so over here let's say
06:03 - we provide the float property and we can
06:06 - decide where we want to display the
06:08 - image so let's say we want to display
06:10 - this image on the right hand side so
06:12 - simply we will say right in this case so
06:14 - basically this float is equal to right
06:16 - will be inherited by this particular
06:19 - image tag over here since we have
06:21 - provided the float is equal to inherit
06:23 - value over here let me just save this
06:25 - file now and try reloading this page
06:27 - once again on the browser so as you can
06:29 - see we have the float is equal to right
06:31 - that is in action guys when we provide
06:33 - the float is equal to left and now we
06:35 - are inheriting this value in the image
06:38 - tag so basically the image will be
06:40 - displayed on the left so let me just
06:41 - reload this page the image is getting
06:44 - displayed on the left of the container
06:46 - so guys based on your requirements you
06:47 - can provide the float property over here
06:50 - so guys in its very simple use the float
06:53 - property can be used to wrap the text
06:55 - around the images which we have seen
06:57 - with the help of examples as well now
06:59 - guys as a homework for you you can
07:01 - complete this example you can create
07:03 - three div elements and place them next
07:06 - to each other by using the float
07:08 - property which should be equal to left
07:11 - and comment in the comment section below
07:12 - once you have completed this homework
07:14 - now guys apart from this we also have
07:16 - the clear property as well so when we
07:19 - use the float property and we want the
07:21 - next element below not on the right or
07:24 - the left so we will have to use the
07:26 - clear property so guys whenever we are
07:29 - using the flute property we will have to
07:31 - clear it by using the clear property as
07:33 - well now the clear property specifies
07:36 - what should happen with the element that
07:38 - is next to the floating element and this
07:40 - we are going to check with the help of
07:41 - examples as well so the clear property
07:44 - has the value that is none by default in
07:46 - which case the element is not pushed
07:48 - below left or right floated elements
07:51 - apart from this we also have the left
07:52 - value in which case the element is
07:54 - pushed below left floated elements in
07:57 - the right value the element is pushed
07:59 - below right floated elements and by
08:01 - using the both value the element is
08:03 - pushed below both left and right floated
08:06 - elements and we also have the inherit
08:08 - value as well so the element inherits
08:11 - the clear value from its parent so guys
08:13 - let us check this with the help of
08:15 - examples in vs code over here so simply
08:17 - I'm going to remove the previous lines
08:19 - of code in this case from the HTML and
08:22 - the CSS files over here and then guys
08:24 - what we will do is we will take this
08:26 - example that I have just mentioned that
08:28 - is to display the div elements next to
08:31 - each other over here so guys what we
08:32 - will do is first of all we will have the
08:34 - container tag over here so we have the
08:37 - class name that is container in this
08:39 - case and let's say we have the three div
08:42 - elements so first div element will have
08:44 - the ID that is div one over here and it
08:46 - will have the text that is div 1 and
08:49 - then similarly we will have div 2 and
08:51 - div three over here so guys over here we
08:54 - have defined the three div texts with
08:56 - the IDS that is div 1 div 2 and div 3
08:59 - inside the class that is container now
09:01 - guys what we will do is inside the
09:03 - style. CSS file we will give separate
09:05 - background colors for all the div tags
09:07 - over here so first of all we will Define
09:09 - the ID that is div 1 and let's say we
09:12 - have the background color of aqua and
09:15 - then let's say we have the div 2 ID over
09:18 - here and this time we will give the
09:20 - background color so basically we will
09:22 - use the color that is yellow this time
09:24 - and for the third diff let's say we use
09:27 - the div 3 ID and this time we will use
09:30 - the background color property and let's
09:32 - say the color that we provide is coral
09:34 - this time so guys let me just save this
09:36 - file now and try reloading this page
09:38 - once again on the browser so as you can
09:40 - see we have the div 1 div 2 and div 3 is
09:43 - getting displayed right now we don't
09:45 - have the background color for diff 3 let
09:47 - us check why so so basically we have
09:50 - made a mistake over here so instead of
09:52 - diff 3 we had provided Dev hash which is
09:55 - not correct let me just save this file
09:56 - now and try reloading this page once
09:58 - again on the browser so as you can see
10:00 - we have the background colors for all
10:02 - the div tags right now guys in order to
10:05 - get all these div elements next to each
10:07 - other simply we can use the float
10:09 - property over here so in the style. CSS
10:12 - file for all these diff tag elements we
10:15 - are going to use the div tag this time
10:18 - and simply inside this div tag we are
10:20 - going to use the float property and for
10:22 - this we are going to use the value that
10:24 - is left over here let me just save this
10:27 - file now and try reloading this page
10:29 - once again on the browser so as you can
10:31 - see all the div elements now are
10:33 - floating to the left now guys let us
10:35 - provide certain padding as well so here
10:37 - we will say padding of 5 pixels for all
10:40 - the div elements over here let me just
10:42 - save this file now and try reloading
10:44 - this page so as you can see now it is
10:46 - having a better readability so all the
10:48 - div elements are placed next to each
10:50 - other and that is the important thing so
10:52 - guys basically just by using the float
10:54 - property over here we can have all the
10:57 - elements that are being placed next next
10:59 - to each other so let's provide the float
11:01 - value for the div tag that is having the
11:04 - ID div one over here and we provide the
11:06 - value as left and from this div tag I'm
11:09 - going to comment out this particular
11:10 - float property let me just save this
11:12 - file now and see what will happen over
11:14 - here to this particular div that is div
11:17 - 1 let me just reload this page once
11:19 - again so as you can see we have div one
11:21 - element over here but to the right of
11:23 - this div one we again have div two this
11:26 - time so guys we have not provided any
11:28 - float proper over here to div 2 element
11:31 - but still it is to the right of the div
11:33 - 1 so in order to clear this particular
11:36 - property of load that we had provided to
11:39 - div 1 we need to use this clear property
11:42 - that we have just mentioned so guys what
11:44 - we will do is for this div 2 ID we will
11:47 - simply say clear and then we will say
11:50 - left in this case so guys what will
11:52 - happen is this div 2 should come below
11:55 - of this div 1 element so let me just
11:57 - save this file now and and try reloading
11:59 - this page once again on the browser so
12:01 - as you can see we have cleared the float
12:04 - property by using the clear property
12:06 - over here and now this particular div 2
12:08 - is getting displayed below the div 1
12:11 - element so guys in this way whatever
12:13 - next element is present inside the HTML
12:15 - file we have provided the float property
12:18 - to div 1 but if we want the next element
12:21 - that is div 2 to be present on the next
12:23 - line we have to provide the clear
12:25 - property for this diff 2 element over
12:27 - here and that is what we have mentioned
12:29 - inside the style. CSS file that is clear
12:32 - it is equal to left guys apart from this
12:34 - you can also try the other values of the
12:36 - clear property as a homework for you so
