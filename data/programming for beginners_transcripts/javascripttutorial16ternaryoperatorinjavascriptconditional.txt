00:00 - so now we will see Turner operator in
00:02 - JavaScript so guys basically Turner
00:05 - operator in JavaScript is used in order
00:08 - to check for certain condition that is
00:10 - similar to the if else conditional
00:12 - statement that we had seen previously so
00:14 - guys basically this turn operator can be
00:17 - an alternative for the if else
00:19 - conditional statement that we had seen
00:21 - previously so you can use this with the
00:23 - help of this particular syntax as you
00:25 - can see first of all we have to provide
00:27 - certain expression over here so
00:29 - basically the result of this expression
00:31 - will be either true or false just like
00:33 - in the if condition we provide certain
00:35 - expression similarly we have to provide
00:38 - the expression in the tary operator as
00:40 - well so guys basically after this
00:42 - expression we have to provide the
00:44 - question mark And Then followed by the
00:46 - lines of code that needs to be executed
00:49 - when the expression is true so guys as
00:51 - you can see this is the Block in which
00:54 - case you will execute if the expression
00:56 - is true over here so if this expression
00:58 - is true these l lines of code will be
01:01 - executed or else basically we have the
01:03 - colon over here after which we have
01:05 - another set of lines of code in which
01:08 - case when the expression is false then
01:10 - these lines of code will be executed on
01:12 - the right hand side so guys basically we
01:14 - have two special characters over here
01:16 - first of all we have the question mark
01:18 - after the expression and then we have
01:20 - the colon over here which is provided
01:23 - after the line of code that is executed
01:26 - when the expression is true so guys let
01:28 - us check this with the help of example
01:30 - in vs code over here so basically what
01:32 - we will do is let us say we Define a
01:34 - variable with the help of the let
01:36 - keyword over here and let's say we
01:38 - provide the variable name as age so
01:40 - let's say your age is 21 years old so
01:43 - what we will do is we will check whether
01:45 - the age is greater than or equal to 18
01:47 - years and then only the person will be
01:50 - allowed to vote so guys basically we
01:52 - will have another variable over here and
01:55 - we will name this variable as a result
01:57 - and then we provide equal to operator
01:59 - and then guys we will use the Turner
02:01 - operator in order to check whether the
02:03 - person based on the age will be allowed
02:06 - to vote or not so we will provide the
02:09 - expression in this case we will say age
02:11 - is greater than or equal to 18 so
02:13 - basically this is the expression that we
02:15 - have provided after which we can provide
02:17 - the question mark over here and then if
02:20 - this particular expression is true let
02:22 - us provide this expression within the
02:24 - parenthesis so that it looks more decent
02:26 - over here and the code is more readable
02:29 - so guys if this expression is true we
02:31 - have to provide the string that is
02:33 - eligible to vote so simply inside the
02:35 - codes over here we will say eligible to
02:38 - vote so as you can see this is the
02:39 - string that we are providing to the
02:41 - result variable and if this expression
02:44 - is not true then we have to provide the
02:46 - colon over here after which we can
02:48 - simply provide not eligible to vote so
02:51 - basically we have another string over
02:53 - here that is not eligible to vote in
02:55 - this case so guys as you can see this is
02:57 - the expression which will either return
03:00 - true or false and then based on the
03:02 - result of this expression if it is true
03:05 - then this particular string will be
03:06 - returned to the result variable and if
03:08 - it is false then not eligible to vote
03:11 - string will be returned to the result
03:13 - and then guys simply we can provide the
03:16 - console. log statement inside which we
03:18 - can simply print the result over here so
03:21 - guys let me just save this file now and
03:23 - since the age is 21 right now it is
03:26 - greater than 18 over here so let us see
03:28 - what will be the output so simply we
03:30 - will type node command over here
03:32 - followed by the name of the Javascript
03:34 - file on the terminal so as you can see
03:36 - eligible to vote is getting printed over
03:38 - here that's because age greater than or
03:41 - equal to 18 is returning us the True
03:43 - Value now guys let us provide another
03:46 - age so let's say the age that we provide
03:48 - is 16 over here so in this case this
03:50 - particular expression is not true so let
03:52 - us see what will be the output on the
03:54 - terminal when we save this file now and
03:56 - try running this code once again over
03:58 - here as you can see it's says not
04:00 - eligible to vote so in this way we can
04:02 - easily use the Turner operator instead
04:05 - of the if else conditional statements
04:07 - that we have seen previously now guys
04:09 - you can also provide more Turner
04:11 - operators inside these lines of code
04:13 - that you have provided so let's say we
04:15 - want to put a condition if the age is
04:17 - greater than 18 then the person is
04:20 - eligible to vote but we also want to put
04:22 - another condition if the age is greater
04:24 - than or equal to 25 then the person is
04:27 - also eligible to drink so guys what we
04:29 - have to to do over here is simply I'm
04:31 - going to remove this part that is
04:32 - eligible to vote and then again we will
04:35 - put another condition over here so let
04:37 - us say we provide age is greater than or
04:40 - equal to 25 so first of all if age is
04:43 - greater than or equal to 18 if this
04:46 - particular statement is true then the
04:48 - control flow will come over here and
04:50 - then it will again check whether age is
04:52 - greater than or equal to 25 so guys over
04:55 - here we will have another set of
04:56 - statements so after this we need to
04:58 - provide question mark over here so we
05:01 - will provide certain statement over here
05:03 - if this particular condition is true and
05:05 - if not then we will provide colon and
05:08 - then again we will have another
05:09 - statement over here in order to make
05:11 - this conditional statement more clear we
05:14 - will have parenthesis at the start and
05:16 - at the end so as you can see we have two
05:18 - conditional statements in this case
05:20 - first of all age is greater than or
05:21 - equal to 18 if it is true then this
05:24 - entire conditional statement will be
05:26 - executed and if not then this particular
05:28 - statement will be returned so guys over
05:30 - here if age is greater than or equal to
05:33 - 25 we will say eligible to vote and
05:37 - drink so guys basically we have this
05:39 - particular statement and for the false
05:40 - statement we will say eligible to vote
05:43 - but not to drink so as you can see I
05:45 - have divided this conditional statement
05:47 - into multiple lines over here so first
05:49 - of all we have this particular
05:50 - expression if this is true then this
05:52 - line of code will be executed if it is
05:55 - false which means we have provided a
05:57 - colon over here then this particular
05:58 - string will be returned to the result
06:00 - variable over here and inside the true
06:03 - statement over here we are having
06:05 - another conditional statement if the age
06:07 - is greater than or equal to 25 then it
06:10 - is going to return eligible to vote and
06:12 - drink and if not then eligible to vote
06:15 - but not to drink in this case so let me
06:17 - just save this file now currently the
06:19 - age is 16 so let us see what will be the
06:21 - output as you can see not eligible to
06:24 - vote is getting printed over here now
06:26 - guys let us say we provide the age is 22
06:29 - so let me just save this file now and
06:31 - try running this code once again as you
06:33 - can see eligible to vote but not to
06:36 - drink is getting printed that's because
06:38 - even though age is greater than or equal
06:40 - to 18 but this particular statement that
06:43 - is age is greater than or equal to 25 is
06:45 - false over here and that is why this
06:47 - particular statement is getting returned
06:49 - and stored in the result variable now
06:52 - guys let us provide another age that is
06:54 - 25 over here in which case this age
06:57 - greater than or equal to 25 will be true
06:59 - so so let me just save this file now and
07:01 - try running this code once again over
07:02 - here as you can see eligible to vote and
07:05 - drink is getting printed over here
07:07 - that's because this particular string is
07:09 - getting returned and stored in the
07:11 - result variable so guys in this way you
07:13 - can use more Turner operators within a
07:15 - single Turner operator over here just
07:18 - like how we have the if else conditional
07:20 - statements inside which we can have the
07:22 - else if conditions as well so guys what
07:24 - will be the output if the age is equal
07:26 - to 24 over here comment in the comment
