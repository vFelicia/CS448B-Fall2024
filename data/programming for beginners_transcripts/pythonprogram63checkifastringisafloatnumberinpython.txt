00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to check if a string is a
00:07 - float number so guys we can find if a
00:09 - string is a float number by writing a
00:12 - function to convert the string to the
00:14 - float number so basically if we are
00:17 - trying to convert the string to the
00:18 - floor number and if it is successful
00:20 - then the function will return true or
00:23 - else the value error exception will be
00:26 - raised and we will return false so
00:28 - basically we are going to see whether we
00:30 - can convert the string to the float
00:32 - number if it is successful then it is a
00:35 - float number and we will return true or
00:37 - else we will return false over here so
00:39 - guys we are going to check these
00:40 - examples as well as you can see this
00:43 - string that is s 1 2 the output should
00:46 - be false because it is not a float
00:48 - number and then we have another string
00:50 - that is 1.123 the output should be true
00:53 - since this is the float number over here
00:55 - so let us check this with the help of
00:57 - the example in the vs code over here so
00:59 - guys that very first thing that we will
01:01 - be doing is we will Define the function
01:03 - that is is float over here which will
01:05 - take the parameter as a string so over
01:07 - here we have is float and then it will
01:10 - take the parameter that is going to be
01:12 - the string value and we will convert the
01:14 - string into the number first of all
01:16 - which will be the float number
01:18 - specifically so over here we will use
01:20 - the try keyword and inside the dry
01:22 - keyword we are trying to convert the
01:25 - string to the float by using the float
01:27 - method over here so guys this load
01:29 - method will help us in order to convert
01:31 - the string to the float number but if
01:33 - the string is not a float number then it
01:36 - will throw the error so guys over here
01:38 - if we are successful then we will return
01:40 - true in this case so we say return true
01:43 - and if there is certain exception that
01:46 - is occurring inside this try block over
01:48 - here we will have the accept block after
01:51 - this so over here we say accept in this
01:53 - case and then we can specify what
01:55 - exception has occurred so we can say
01:57 - value error in this case so guys what
02:00 - happens is inappropriate argument value
02:02 - of correct type which means if this
02:05 - float function is not getting a string
02:07 - which is not actually a float number
02:09 - then it will throw the value error over
02:11 - here so we are going to use this value
02:13 - error and then if this value error
02:15 - occurs and we are going to return false
02:18 - in this case so we say return false so
02:21 - guys basically what we need to do is we
02:23 - need to call this is float function in
02:26 - order to check whether the string that
02:28 - is provided by the user is the float
02:30 - number or not so over here what we will
02:32 - do is we will come out of this function
02:34 - and then we can simply have the print
02:37 - statement over here and then we are
02:39 - going to call this is float function
02:41 - with a particular string as the
02:43 - parameter so over here we will say is
02:45 - float and then the parameter that we are
02:47 - going to pass is the same value that we
02:50 - have seen that is s 12 over here so
02:52 - inside the single quotes we will say as
02:55 - 1 2 in this case so guys what should be
02:58 - the output let us check that I'll save
03:00 - this file now and try running this code
03:02 - so as you can see we have got the output
03:03 - as false that's because this is not a
03:05 - float number over here since there is no
03:08 - decimal point and we are having a
03:10 - character as well now guys we are going
03:12 - to provide this 1.123 SD string value
03:16 - inside this is float function so let me
03:19 - just paste this over here and then let
03:21 - me just save this file and try running
03:22 - this code once again so this time we are
03:24 - getting true as the output that's
03:26 - because there is a decimal over here and
03:28 - all the characters are the numbers in
03:31 - this case there is no string character
03:33 - let's say we provide s over here in
03:35 - between the numbers so that the string
03:38 - is 1.12 S3 so this time what will be the
03:41 - output let us check that so I'll just
03:43 - save this file now and try running this
03:45 - code so guys as you can see we are
03:47 - getting the output as false that's
03:49 - because there is a character in between
03:51 - the numbers and it cannot be completely
03:53 - converted to the float so that is why we
03:56 - are getting the false output over here
03:58 - now guys what if we provide the doing as
04:01 - 21.34 whether this is the float number
04:04 - or not comment in the comment section
04:06 - below let us see whether your answer is
04:08 - correct or not so guys please practice
04:10 - on your own so that on different inputs
04:12 - you get different outputs and also you
04:14 - will be successfully able to write the
04:16 - correct answer in the comment section
04:17 - below for this particular string input
04:20 - please make sure that you like this
04:21 - video so that it reaches to more people
04:23 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
04:25 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
04:27 - as well the next video that we are going
04:29 - to talk about is Python program to count
04:32 - the occurrence of an item inside the
04:34 - list so stay tuned
