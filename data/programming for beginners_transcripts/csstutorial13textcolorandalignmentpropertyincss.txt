00:00 - so now we will see text color and
00:02 - Alignment property in CSS so guys
00:05 - basically the color property is used to
00:07 - set the color of the text and apart from
00:10 - this the text align property is used to
00:13 - set the horizontal alignment of a text
00:16 - so we will check this with the help of
00:17 - examples as well in vs code so the very
00:19 - first property that we are going to see
00:21 - related to the text in HTML is the color
00:24 - property so guys let us move to the vs
00:26 - code over here and I'll simply remove
00:28 - the previous lines of code in this case
00:30 - and basically we are going to have a
00:32 - simple heading that is with the tag H1
00:35 - over here and we will say this is
00:38 - heading one so basically we have the
00:41 - statement that is this is heading one
00:43 - inside the H1 heading tag over here let
00:45 - me just save this file now and we will
00:48 - also clear the lines of code that we had
00:49 - return previously inside the style. CSS
00:53 - so let me just save these files now and
00:55 - try reloading this page on the browser
00:57 - so as you can see we have this is
00:59 - heading one over here now guys by
01:01 - default the color of this text is black
01:03 - color so what if we want to provide the
01:06 - different text color to this heading so
01:09 - let me just go to the style. CSS file
01:11 - over here since the HTML file is linked
01:14 - to the style. CSS by using the link tag
01:17 - in this case so guys over here we will
01:19 - provide the tag name that is H1 and
01:22 - simply we are going to provide the color
01:24 - property over here so as you can see
01:26 - this is the property that we are going
01:27 - to use and we can provide any color
01:29 - color in this case in order to be
01:31 - reflected as the text color for this
01:34 - heading that is H1 over here so guys
01:37 - what we will do is simply we are going
01:38 - to provide the color that is red color
01:41 - in this case let me just save this file
01:43 - now and try reloading this page once
01:45 - again on the browser so as you can see
01:47 - now the color of this heading is being
01:49 - updated as red color so this is the way
01:52 - that we can use the color property in
01:54 - order to update the text color for a
01:57 - specific HTML element now guys apart
01:59 - from this you can also use the hex color
02:01 - or the RGB values as well for the color
02:04 - value so let's say we want to provide
02:06 - the hex value over here so we provide
02:08 - hashtag followed by the red color
02:10 - component that is double F and then the
02:12 - green color component that is 0 0 and
02:15 - then we have the blue color component
02:17 - that is 0 0 over here so this will be
02:19 - the red color what if we want to mix the
02:21 - red and green color over here so simply
02:24 - we have to provide the 2 * f for the
02:26 - green component as well so it will be
02:28 - updated to this particular color that is
02:30 - the yellow color over here which is the
02:32 - mixture of red color and the green color
02:35 - so let me just save this file now and
02:36 - try reloading this page so as you can
02:39 - see this is the yellow color that is
02:40 - being displayed on the UI it is not
02:42 - going so well with the white color
02:45 - background over here so let me just
02:46 - change the background color as well so
02:49 - in this case we will provide the
02:50 - background color as black in this case
02:52 - let me just save this file now and try
02:54 - reloading this page so as you can see we
02:56 - have the background color is black and
02:58 - the text color is yellow yellow now so
03:00 - guys this is the way that you can define
03:02 - the color value using the hex value or
03:04 - the color name or the RGB values as well
03:07 - now guys apart from this in order to
03:09 - align the text you can use the text
03:11 - align property as well so by default
03:14 - over here as you can see on the UI the
03:16 - text is being aligned on the left hand
03:18 - side let's say we want this text to be
03:21 - displayed at the center over here of
03:23 - this particular screen so what we can do
03:25 - is simply we can use the text align
03:28 - property so over here we have text
03:30 - hyphen align so this is the text align
03:32 - property that we will be using and it is
03:35 - having multiple values so as you can see
03:37 - Center is the value we also have and
03:39 - justify left right so basically by
03:42 - default this is the value that is left
03:44 - value for the text align which is
03:46 - getting applied on all the HTML elements
03:49 - so over here let's say we want the text
03:52 - to be displayed at the center so simply
03:54 - we provide the center value to the text
03:56 - align property let me just save this
03:58 - file now and try reloading this this
03:59 - page once again on the browser so as you
04:02 - can see the text is getting displayed at
04:04 - the center of the screen now with the
04:06 - help of the text align property
04:08 - similarly if we want this text to be
04:10 - displayed on the right hand side of the
04:12 - screen so what we can do is instead of
04:14 - having the center value we can have the
04:16 - right value over here let me just save
04:18 - this file now and try reloading this
04:20 - page once again on the browser so as you
04:23 - can see we are having this particular
04:24 - text on the right side of the browser so
04:27 - this is the way that the text align prop
04:29 - property works for a particular text
04:31 - element which is the part of the HTML
04:33 - element now guys apart from this we also
04:36 - have something called as text align last
04:38 - so basically this reflects the alignment
04:41 - of the last line of a particular
04:43 - paragraph so let us check that as well
04:45 - so guys in order to understand this we
04:47 - need to have a paragraph which is having
04:49 - multiple lines over here so let's say we
04:51 - have the P tag we can also have the text
04:54 - inside the Dev tag as well and over here
04:56 - we are going to Simply generate the
04:58 - random text by using the lurm M
05:01 - abbreviation so over here we have the
05:03 - simple random text that is getting
05:05 - generated let me just save this file now
05:08 - and try reloading this page so as you
05:10 - can see this is the text that is
05:12 - generated inside the paragraph tag over
05:14 - here now guys what is the meaning of the
05:16 - text align last property so basically
05:19 - the last line over here inside the
05:21 - paragraph will be aligned based on the
05:23 - value that we provide to this text align
05:25 - last property so let us check that as
05:28 - well so over here since since we have
05:29 - used the paragraph tag in the style. CSS
05:33 - property we will be defining the P tag
05:35 - over here and for this tag we are going
05:37 - to provide the text align last property
05:40 - so as you can see this is the property
05:42 - that we are going to use and let's say
05:44 - we want the last line to be at the
05:47 - center of the screen so simply we can
05:49 - provide the center apart from the center
05:51 - we also have many other values as you
05:53 - can see we have justify left right and
05:56 - so on so basically we are going to apply
05:58 - the center value do in this case let me
06:00 - just save this file now and try
06:02 - reloading this page once again on the
06:04 - browser so as you can see the last line
06:06 - of this paragraph is now getting
06:09 - displayed at the center of the screen
06:11 - now guys if we want to display it on the
06:13 - right hand side of the screen so what we
06:15 - can do is simply we can provide the
06:17 - right value to this property over here
06:20 - let me just save this file now and try
06:22 - reloading this page so as you can see
06:24 - the last line of the paragraph is now
06:26 - getting displayed on the right of the
06:28 - screen and apart from that we also have
06:31 - something called as justify value so let
06:33 - us check what happens let me just save
06:35 - this file now and try reloading this
06:37 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:40 - can see every word on this last line is
06:43 - now getting separated with the help of
06:45 - equal spaces in between them so guys if
06:48 - you want the last line of the paragraph
06:50 - to be displayed in this way you can use
06:53 - the justify value for the text align
06:56 - last property inside the CSS file so
06:58 - this is the work working of another text
07:00 - align property that you can apply for
07:02 - the last line of a particular paragraph
07:04 - or the div element now guys apart from
07:07 - this we have something called as
07:08 - direction as well so basically this will
07:10 - Define the direction of text which will
07:12 - be displayed on the browser so by
07:14 - default it will be left to right so over
07:17 - here as you can see the direction of the
07:19 - text is from left to right let us check
07:21 - this with another example over here so
07:23 - let's say we have another div tag in
07:26 - this case so simply we are going to have
07:28 - the div tag and we will say this is a
07:31 - test div element so guys basically we
07:34 - have a simple this is a test div element
07:36 - over here let me just save this file now
07:38 - and try reloading this page once again
07:40 - on the browser so as you can see this is
07:42 - a Dev element now guys what is the
07:44 - meaning of Direction CSS property so let
07:48 - us provide that property in the style.
07:50 - CSS file over here so inside this file
07:53 - we are going to provide the diff tag in
07:55 - this case and simply we are going to
07:57 - provide the directions CSS property so
08:00 - guys basically we have the values that
08:02 - is LTR which stands for left to right
08:05 - which is the default value which means
08:08 - the letters will be displayed from left
08:10 - to right and that is the standard way in
08:12 - order to display the letters and apart
08:14 - from that we also have other value that
08:17 - is RTL which stands for right to left so
08:20 - guys let us check what happens in this
08:21 - case so let me just save this file now
08:24 - and try reloading this page once again
08:25 - on the browser so as you can see now the
08:28 - text is getting displayed on the right
08:30 - but in order to reverse this text we
08:32 - have another property so we can use that
08:35 - as well so we have the property that is
08:37 - uni code hyphen BD so guys over here we
08:40 - are going to use this property and we
08:42 - say the value that is BD override so in
08:45 - this case what will happen is the
08:47 - letters will be displayed from the right
08:49 - to left Direction so let me just save
08:51 - this file now and try reloading this
08:53 - page once again on the browser so now if
08:56 - you see the letters are reversed so
08:58 - basically you need to to read from the
09:00 - right to the left in order to understand
09:02 - the statement that is being provided
09:05 - inside this Dev element so guys in this
09:07 - way if you want to reverse the direction
09:10 - of the letters that are being displayed
09:11 - on the UI you can use the combination of
09:14 - these two CSS properties that is
09:16 - direction should be RTL and the Unicode
09:19 - BD should be BD hyphen override in this
09:22 - case so Guys these are certain CSS
09:24 - properties as far as the text color and
09:26 - the text alignment is concerned comment
