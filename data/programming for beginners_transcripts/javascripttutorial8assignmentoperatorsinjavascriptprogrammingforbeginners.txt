00:00 - so now we will see assignment operators
00:02 - in JavaScript so guys below are some of
00:04 - the assignment operators in JavaScript
00:07 - and basically we have the very simple
00:09 - operator that is equal to in order to
00:11 - either assign the Direct Value to a
00:13 - variable or to copy the value from one
00:16 - variable to another variable so as you
00:18 - can see X is equal to Y this is one
00:20 - example over here now guys apart from
00:22 - this we also have another operator that
00:24 - is plus equal to so this time what will
00:26 - happen is as you can see this is the way
00:29 - that we can use plus and equal to
00:31 - operator over here so this is same as x
00:33 - = x + y so guys over here let us say we
00:36 - want to add two numbers that is X and Y
00:39 - and we want to store the result in the
00:42 - first variable that is X so simply what
00:44 - we do is X it is equal to x + y over
00:47 - here so on the right hand side we find
00:49 - the addition of the two numbers and on
00:51 - the left hand side we are assigning the
00:53 - value of the addition to the first
00:55 - variable itself that is X now guys there
00:57 - is a shorthand method in order to
00:59 - achieve the same task that is by
01:01 - combining the plus operator and the
01:03 - equal to operator and the same thing we
01:05 - are doing over here so we say x it is +
01:09 - equal and then y over here which is
01:11 - going to have the same effect that is X
01:13 - is = x + y and then similarly we have
01:16 - minus and equal to operator that is x -
01:19 - y it is going to be assigned to X over
01:22 - here so simply we can say x - equal to Y
01:25 - over here and similarly we can find the
01:27 - values by using the other operators as
01:29 - well so guys let us check all these with
01:31 - the help of example in vs code over here
01:34 - so what we will do is let us simply have
01:36 - the variable that is X this time and we
01:38 - will say xit is equal to 10 over here we
01:41 - will have another variable that is y it
01:43 - is equal to 20 this time and let us add
01:46 - both the numbers and assign it to the
01:48 - first variable that is X so simply we
01:50 - are going to say x it is equal to x + y
01:53 - over here now guys let us print the
01:55 - value of x this time so simply we are
01:57 - going to have the console. log statement
01:59 - over here inside which we are going to
02:01 - have the back text and then we will say
02:03 - value of x is equal to followed by
02:06 - dollar and then we have the open and
02:08 - close curly braces and then we will have
02:10 - the variable name that is X this time so
02:13 - guys basically we have done X + Y which
02:15 - is 10 + 20 which is equal to 30 and the
02:18 - value 30 is being assigned to this
02:20 - variable X so this statement must print
02:23 - the value of x which is equal to 30 this
02:25 - time so when we save this file now and
02:27 - try running this code on the terminal
02:29 - over here so as you can see value of x
02:32 - it is equal to 30 this time so this is
02:34 - the very basic arithmetic operation that
02:36 - we have covered now guys what we can do
02:38 - is we can use the shorthand method over
02:41 - here so I will comment out this line of
02:43 - code and again we will rewrite this
02:45 - particular line of code over here by
02:47 - using the shorthand method so what is
02:49 - the shorthand method we first write the
02:51 - X variable in which we want to store the
02:54 - result followed by the space character
02:56 - and then we have the plus operator
02:58 - followed by the equal to operator this
03:00 - time and then followed by the space
03:01 - character and then we have the Y
03:03 - variable over here so guys basically
03:05 - this is nothing but X is equal to X + Y
03:08 - which we have already commented out over
03:10 - here so basically the meaning of this is
03:12 - X it is equal to x + y but this is the
03:15 - Shand method that we are using so when
03:17 - we save this file now and try running
03:19 - this code once again on the terminal so
03:21 - as you can see value of x it is equal to
03:24 - 30 This Time by using this particular
03:26 - shorthand method now instead of having
03:28 - the plus operator we can have the minus
03:30 - operator as well so over here we say xus
03:33 - it is equal to Y over here so this is
03:35 - nothing but X is equal to x- Y this time
03:38 - which means 10 - 20 which is equal to -
03:41 - 10 when we save this file now and try
03:43 - running this code once again so as you
03:45 - can see value of x it is equal to - 10
03:48 - over here and in this way we can use the
03:50 - shorthand method as far as the
03:52 - subtraction of two numbers are concerned
03:54 - similarly we can do the multiplication
03:57 - as well so if we want to do X is equal
03:59 - to X * by y simply we can do x * y equal
04:03 - to Y over here when we save this file
04:06 - now and try running this code once again
04:08 - over here so you can see value of x it
04:10 - is equal to 200 because 10 * 20 it is
04:13 - equal to 200 over here apart from this
04:16 - we can also use the division operator
04:18 - over here so if we want to do x / y over
04:21 - here and store it inside the X variable
04:24 - simply you can say x / equal to Y over
04:28 - here so when we save this file now and
04:30 - try running this code once again over
04:31 - here as you can see value of x is equal
04:33 - to 0.5 because 10 / 20 it is equal to
04:37 - 0.5 this time similarly we can find the
04:40 - remainder of two numbers as well so if
04:42 - we want to do x per Y in which case we
04:45 - are going to do x / y this time and we
04:48 - are going to find the remainder so
04:50 - simply we can say x% equal to Y so 10
04:53 - ided by 20 the quotient will be zero and
04:56 - the remainder must be 10 and the value
04:58 - of 10 must be displayed over here on the
05:00 - output so as you can see value of x it
05:02 - is equal to 10 and then we have another
05:05 - operator over here that is
05:06 - exponentiation which means X ra to the
05:09 - power of Y over here so guys basically
05:11 - if we want to do X ra to the power of Y
05:13 - this time and store it to the variable
05:16 - that is X over here so simply we can say
05:18 - x followed by space character and then 2
05:20 - * star character over here followed by
05:23 - equal 2 and then we say y over here and
05:25 - the result will be stored on the left
05:27 - hand side variable that is X this time
05:29 - so let just save this file now let us
05:31 - see what will be the result for 10 ra to
05:33 - the power of 20 this time so when we run
05:35 - this code once again over here as you
05:37 - can see 10 to the^ of 20 we are getting
05:40 - the result over here now guys when we
05:41 - change the values in this case let us
05:43 - say we have X it is equal to 3 and Y
05:46 - again is equal to 3 so what will be the
05:48 - output of X ra to the power of Y over
05:50 - here when both the values are three over
05:52 - here so guys comment in the comment
05:54 - section below what will be the answer of
05:56 - this particular operation over here and
05:58 - what value will will be present inside
06:00 - the variable X let us see whether your
06:02 - answer is correct or not so please make
