00:00 - so now we will see input attribute
00:02 - required in input field so guys
00:04 - basically the input required attribute
00:07 - specifies that an input field must be
00:09 - fielded out before submitting the form
00:12 - so basically this required attribute
00:14 - actually needs the users to provide the
00:16 - data inside this particular input field
00:19 - which is having the attribute that is
00:21 - required now guys the required attribute
00:24 - works with the input type such as text
00:26 - search URL telephone number email
00:30 - password date Pickers number checkbox
00:33 - radio and file so guys as we can see
00:36 - there are maximum input field types over
00:38 - here which are covered as far as
00:40 - required attribute is concerned so guys
00:43 - let us check this with the help of
00:44 - example in vs code over here so
00:46 - previously we had seen the input tag
00:48 - along with the type file over here then
00:50 - we had also seen the text and the
00:52 - password types we had used the
00:54 - placeholder attribute and the multiple
00:56 - attribute as well now guys what we will
00:58 - do is we will have have another input
01:00 - field and we will ask the user to
01:03 - provide age in this case so we will have
01:06 - the input field with the type number in
01:08 - this case so as you can see the input
01:10 - tag along with the type number over here
01:13 - and then the AG attribute will have the
01:15 - value as age in this case and ID as well
01:18 - we will keep it as age over here now
01:20 - guys we will also provide the label so
01:22 - that the user understands that he or she
01:25 - is supposed to provide the age so
01:27 - basically for the four attribute we will
01:29 - have the value that is age and the label
01:31 - we will provide it as provide your age
01:35 - followed by colon so guys after this we
01:37 - will have couple of line braks so that
01:39 - the submit button is displayed on the
01:41 - next line now guys first of all we will
01:43 - see what happens when we don't provide
01:45 - the required attribute over here so
01:48 - simply let me just save this file now
01:49 - and try reloading this page once again
01:51 - on the browser so as you can see we have
01:53 - the provide your age label and then the
01:56 - input field is being provided but guys
01:58 - we have not provided the required
02:00 - attribute to any of these fields for now
02:03 - so simply if the user comes over here
02:06 - and clicks on submit basically the form
02:09 - will be submitted in this case with all
02:11 - the blank values for all the parameters
02:13 - so as you can see file is equal to blank
02:16 - then username and password is also blank
02:18 - and the age is also blank now guys this
02:20 - is not one of the best practices in
02:22 - order to send the password as a get
02:24 - request over here that's because anyone
02:26 - can see the password inside the URL so
02:29 - I'll simply remove this line of code
02:31 - over here that is having input field
02:33 - password in this case let me just save
02:35 - this file now and try reloading this
02:37 - page once again on the browser so now if
02:39 - we submit it once again as you can see
02:41 - all the values are blank for now so guys
02:43 - what we have to do is compulsorily we
02:46 - want the user to at least provide the
02:48 - age if they are not providing any other
02:50 - inputs over here so what we can do is
02:53 - simply for this input field with the
02:55 - type number in which case we are dealing
02:57 - with the age input field we we will come
03:00 - to the end and we will say required in
03:02 - this case so guys basically this
03:04 - required attribute is used in order to
03:07 - make the user provide some data to this
03:10 - particular input field so let me just
03:12 - save this file now and try reloading
03:14 - this page once again on the browser so
03:16 - as you can see we have this provide your
03:18 - age input field in this case and then
03:20 - when we click on submit over here as you
03:22 - can see please feel out this field so
03:24 - basically this validation is being
03:26 - thrown by this particular browser and
03:28 - depending on the browser different
03:30 - message can be displayed based on which
03:32 - browser is being used by the user so
03:34 - guys irrespective of which browser is
03:36 - being used by the user but basically a
03:38 - validation message will be thrown if the
03:41 - input field is kept blank and the user
03:43 - tries to submit the form so we need to
03:46 - provide some age over here so let's say
03:48 - if we provide 25 that is some number in
03:51 - the form of age in the input field and
03:54 - then when the user clicks on submit now
03:56 - the form accepts that particular input
03:58 - and will be sending all the values of
04:00 - the parameters to the server but since
04:02 - user has provided only the age parameter
04:05 - over here the age parameter is having
04:07 - the value and the other two attributes
04:09 - are having the blank values over here
04:11 - but guys this is the main functionality
04:13 - of the required attribute so whatever
04:16 - input Fields you want the user to
04:18 - provide some data with you can use this
04:20 - required attribute to all those input
04:23 - fields we can also provide the required
04:25 - attribute to this username field as well
04:27 - so let's say when we provide the
04:29 - required attribute over here let me just
04:31 - save this file now and try reloading
04:33 - this page once again on the browser so
04:35 - now if we try to submit the form it is
04:38 - asking to please fill out this field
04:40 - that is username over here so let me
04:41 - just provide some username in this case
04:43 - so we have provided programming as the
04:46 - username so now let me just click on
04:48 - submit over here but we also have the
04:50 - required field that is age in this case
04:53 - so it is saying please fill out this
04:54 - field as well so we provide 25 as the
04:57 - age and when we click on submit over
04:59 - here so now the HTML form is accepting
05:02 - the inputs that is provided by the user
05:04 - that is username as well as age in this
05:07 - case because those are the input fields
05:08 - which are marked as required so guys
05:10 - this is the way that required attributes
05:12 - work over here in HTML input Fields
