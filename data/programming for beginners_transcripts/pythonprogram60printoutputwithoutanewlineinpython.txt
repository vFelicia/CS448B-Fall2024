00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:04 - Python program to print output without a
00:06 - new line so guys this Python program
00:08 - will help you to print statements
00:11 - without a new line at the end of the
00:13 - print statement so usually whenever we
00:16 - are using the print statement the next
00:18 - time when we have another print
00:19 - statement then the control flow will go
00:21 - to the next line and print that
00:23 - statement but let's say if we want to
00:25 - continue on the same line then we will
00:28 - be using the end parameter in the print
00:30 - function to avoid the new line so let us
00:33 - check this with the help of example now
00:35 - over here in the vs code so let's say we
00:37 - have the print statement in this case
00:39 - and it is a very simple string so let's
00:42 - say we have this is a statement so we
00:45 - say this is a statement over here and
00:48 - then let's say we have another print
00:50 - statement and then we again type this is
00:53 - another
00:54 - statement this time so let me just save
00:57 - this file now and try running this code
00:59 - once so as you can see we have got both
01:01 - the statements but both of them are on
01:03 - different lines over here so this is a
01:05 - statement is on one line and this is
01:07 - another statement is on the second line
01:09 - so what if we want both these statements
01:12 - on the same line so guys what we can do
01:14 - is we can use the end parameter inside
01:17 - this print statement so over here what
01:20 - we can do is after the string or any
01:22 - data that we want to print we provide a
01:25 - comma and Then followed by end parameter
01:27 - over here as you can see vs code is
01:30 - suggesting us this end parameter we have
01:32 - to use this one and then followed by a
01:34 - blank space or you can also use the
01:37 - space character or else we can also use
01:39 - full stop as well followed by the space
01:41 - character so in whatever form you want
01:44 - to separate both these statements at
01:46 - this this is a statement and then this
01:48 - is another statement you can provide
01:50 - that particular character over here
01:52 - inside the end parameter so guys let us
01:54 - say we have the full stop followed by a
01:56 - space character over here then what will
01:58 - be the output on the terminal and let me
02:00 - just save this file now and try running
02:02 - this code once so as you can see we have
02:04 - got this is a statement on one line and
02:07 - Then followed by a full stop and then we
02:09 - have a space character as well and then
02:12 - we have this is another statement on the
02:14 - same line itself so guys this is the
02:16 - functionality of the end parameter it
02:19 - will help us in order to print the next
02:21 - statement that is being provided to the
02:23 - print function over here on the same
02:25 - line now guys what if we have another
02:27 - print statement over here and then let's
02:30 - say we have this is third statement
02:35 - so what will happen to this third
02:37 - statement whether it will be printed on
02:39 - the next line or whether it will be
02:41 - printed on the same line where both
02:43 - these statements are printed so let me
02:45 - just save this file now and try running
02:46 - this code so as you can see we have got
02:48 - this is a statement and then this is
02:51 - another statement the entire string on
02:53 - one line that is both the statements on
02:55 - one line but then when we have this is
02:58 - third statement over here it goes on the
03:00 - second line now guys why this third
03:02 - statement has gone to the second line
03:04 - over here that's because after this
03:06 - print statement we did not have any end
03:08 - parameter so the control flow assumed
03:11 - that the end parameter is having the new
03:13 - line character so the next print
03:15 - statement is going on the next line over
03:17 - here so guys after each print statement
03:20 - we have to provide the end parameter if
03:23 - you want to have the next print
03:25 - statement to be printed on the same line
03:27 - so let's say if you want this statement
03:29 - to be printed on the same line again so
03:31 - again we have to provide the end
03:33 - parameter over here and then let's say
03:35 - this time we provide hyphen as the
03:38 - separator so over here after this is
03:40 - another statement this particular hyphen
03:42 - will be displayed after which this is
03:45 - third statement will be printed so let
03:47 - me just save this file now and try
03:48 - running this code all the three
03:50 - statements must be present on the same
03:52 - line so as you can see we have got this
03:54 - is a statement followed by full stop and
03:57 - then we have this is another statement
03:58 - and Then followed by iPhone we have this
04:01 - is third statement over here so guys
04:03 - this is the way that we can avoid new
04:05 - line while we are using the print
04:07 - statement using the Python program so
