00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to check if a number is
00:06 - odd or even so guys basically a number
00:08 - is A1 if it is perfectly divisible by 2
00:11 - which means when we divide any number by
00:14 - 2 and when we get the remainder as 0
00:16 - that means it is an even number and if
00:19 - the remainder is not 0 then it is an odd
00:21 - number so when the number is divided by
00:23 - 2 we use the remainder operator that is
00:26 - percent to compute the remainder and if
00:29 - the remainder is not 0 the number is odd
00:31 - and if the remainder is 0 then the
00:33 - number must be E1 so guys let us check
00:35 - this with the help of the Python program
00:37 - so over here what we will do is we will
00:39 - take the number input from the user and
00:42 - it will be of the integer data type so
00:44 - we will use the int function over here
00:46 - and inside this we will take the input
00:48 - since the default input gives us the
00:51 - string data type we need to convert it
00:52 - into the integer and that is why we have
00:55 - provided this integer function over here
00:57 - as the prefix and then inside this we
00:59 - have has to provide enter a number so
01:03 - basically we are providing the
01:04 - instruction to the user in order to
01:06 - enter the number so basically when the
01:08 - user enters the number it will be of the
01:10 - string data type we are converting the
01:12 - string data type into the integer by
01:14 - using the int function over here as the
01:16 - prefix now guys we will have the integer
01:19 - inside this number variable and we can
01:21 - simply use the percent operator in order
01:23 - to check whether the integer is a odd or
01:26 - even number so over here we say the if
01:28 - condition and we say number percent in
01:32 - this case so percent and then 2 whether
01:34 - it is equal to zero so guys this is the
01:36 - important condition this is used in
01:39 - order to check what will be the
01:40 - remainder when we divide the number by 2
01:43 - and if it is 0 then it is an even number
01:45 - in this case so over here what we will
01:47 - do is simply we will print the statement
01:50 - that is entered number so we say entered
01:53 - number and then we will provide the
01:56 - number that is entered by the user which
01:58 - will replace this curly braces over here
02:00 - is an even number we will say so we say
02:04 - is an even number and then we have to
02:06 - use the dot format function after the
02:08 - string so inside this dot format we will
02:11 - simply provide this number variable so
02:13 - that it replaces this open and close
02:16 - curly braces over here so guys if the
02:18 - entire number is even number this
02:20 - condition will get satisfied since a
02:21 - remainder will be 0 or else if it is an
02:24 - odd number what we have to do is simply
02:25 - we have to come in the else part and
02:28 - again we will print the statement so
02:29 - I'll simply copy this line of code and
02:32 - paste this over here and we will say
02:33 - entered number that is this number is an
02:36 - odd number this time so we say odd
02:38 - number and Then followed by dot format
02:41 - and then number so guys let me just save
02:43 - this file now and try running this code
02:44 - so as you can see the user is being
02:46 - asked to enter a number so let's say we
02:48 - provide the number as 8 this time so
02:51 - when we press enter as you can see enter
02:53 - number 8 is an even number why so when
02:56 - we divide the number that is 8 by 2 we
02:59 - get 4 is quotient and 0 as the remainder
03:02 - and that is why it is an even number
03:03 - let's say we provide another number so
03:06 - this time we say enter a number and it
03:08 - is 3 this time and when we press enter
03:10 - as you can see enter number three is an
03:13 - odd number that's because 3 cannot be
03:15 - perfectly divided by 2 and that is why
03:17 - it is an odd number guys let us run this
03:19 - code once again and this time we provide
03:21 - the number that is 11 so what will be
03:24 - the output of this whether it is an even
03:25 - number or the odd number comment in the
03:28 - comment section below as a homework for
03:29 - you so guys make sure that you practice
03:31 - on your own so that on different inputs
03:33 - you get different output and after
03:35 - writing this program comment in the
03:36 - comment section below whether 11 is a
03:39 - even number or the odd number please
03:41 - make sure that you like this video so
