00:00 - so now we will see form elements in HTML
00:03 - so guys basically there are various form
00:05 - elements in HTML so one of the form
00:07 - elements is input tag which takes the
00:10 - input from the user so guys let us check
00:12 - this with the help of example in the VSS
00:15 - code over here so first of all what we
00:17 - will do is we will Define the paragraph
00:19 - by using the P tag over here and then we
00:22 - will say below content is in form so
00:26 - guys we have a very simple statement
00:28 - that is below content is in form and
00:30 - then on the next line we will Define the
00:32 - form tag over here so we type form and
00:34 - as you can see this is the Mt
00:36 - abbreviation that is form tag over here
00:38 - we are going to select this and the
00:40 - action attribute helps us in order to
00:43 - provide the name of the server side file
00:46 - that will be responsible in order to
00:48 - handle the data when this form is
00:50 - submitted so guys we are going to ignore
00:52 - this particular action attribute for now
00:54 - since it deals with the file that is on
00:56 - the server side now guys what we are
00:58 - going to do is we are going to simply
01:00 - provide the input tag over here so that
01:03 - the user can provide certain input so we
01:05 - will provide the input tag in this case
01:08 - and the type will be text over here so
01:10 - guys basically there are multiple types
01:12 - for the input tag so the type text helps
01:15 - us to have a single line text box that
01:18 - will help the user to provide certain
01:20 - data which we can send to the server now
01:22 - guys we can have a particular name to
01:24 - this text box so let's say we provide
01:26 - the name value as a name over here and
01:29 - then let's say we provide the ID as
01:31 - YouTube channel so guys basically we are
01:34 - going to provide the YouTube channel
01:36 - name in this particular text box and
01:38 - that is why we have given the ID that is
01:40 - YouTube channel we can modify it as
01:43 - YouTube channel name over here so that
01:45 - it becomes more specific and over here
01:47 - as well we will say YT and then name
01:50 - over here so guys basically we have
01:51 - provided the input text box in this case
01:54 - let me just save this file now and try
01:56 - reloading this page once again on the
01:58 - browser so as you can can see below
02:00 - content is in form and we are Simply
02:02 - Having the text box over here that will
02:04 - allow the user to provide certain data
02:07 - inside the text box in this case but
02:09 - guys this Standalone text box doesn't
02:12 - give us much idea about what kind of
02:14 - data is being expected from the user so
02:17 - basically we have another form element
02:19 - that is the label element which will
02:21 - Define the label for this input so guys
02:23 - what we can do is before this input we
02:26 - can have the label tag as well so over
02:28 - here we can provide the lab
02:30 - and then guys we have something called
02:31 - as for attribute which will take the
02:34 - value as the ID of the input that we
02:37 - want this label to link with so guys
02:40 - this label will be related to this text
02:42 - box so we should have the ID of this
02:44 - text box being copied and pasted over
02:47 - here as the value of this for attribute
02:49 - so that when the user clicks on this
02:51 - label this particular input text field
02:54 - gets activated so we need to provide the
02:56 - label that is YouTube channel name over
03:00 - here so guys basically this is the
03:02 - simple text that will be displayed to
03:04 - the user so that he or she comes to know
03:06 - that what input is being expected to be
03:09 - provided inside this text box after this
03:11 - label we will have the line break so
03:13 - that the input is displayed on the next
03:15 - line and over here as well we are going
03:17 - to have the line break in this case let
03:19 - me just save this file now and try
03:20 - reloading this page once again on the
03:22 - browser so as you can see now we have
03:25 - the YouTube channel name and this makes
03:27 - more sense since the user comes to know
03:29 - that inside the text box you are
03:31 - supposed to provide the name of this
03:33 - YouTube channel so guys basically this
03:34 - for attribute helps us in order to click
03:38 - on this label so that we can activate
03:40 - this text box over here so when we click
03:42 - on this YouTube channel name so as you
03:44 - can see the text box is being activated
03:47 - now and then we can simply provide the
03:49 - name of this YouTube channel which you
03:51 - should definitely subscribe if you have
03:53 - not done so so basically we have
03:55 - provided a name that is programming for
03:57 - beginners over here by using the simple
03:59 - label and the input text box now guys
04:01 - let us move to another element we have
04:03 - something called as select which helps
04:05 - us in order to provide the dropdown list
04:08 - so guys over here we can provide the
04:09 - select tag as well so when we provide
04:12 - the select tag we again have the name
04:14 - and the ID over here so let's say we
04:16 - provide the name as social media in this
04:18 - case so we are going to provide the list
04:20 - of social media platforms and the ID we
04:23 - will again keep it as social media so
04:25 - over here we will copy and paste it as
04:28 - the social media over here now guys what
04:30 - we have to do is in between the select
04:32 - starting and the ending tag we need to
04:34 - have the list of values being defined
04:36 - over here so simply we can have the
04:38 - option tag so as you can see option tag
04:41 - will help us in order to have the list
04:44 - of values that we can provide inside the
04:47 - select tag over here so basically the
04:49 - first option let us say we have YouTube
04:52 - as the first option in this case and
04:54 - then let me just copy this and paste it
04:56 - few times so that we can provide the
04:58 - different values for for these options
05:00 - so let's say we have the second option
05:02 - is Facebook and then let's say the third
05:05 - option is Instagram over here and then
05:07 - let's say we have Twitter in this case
05:10 - so basically we have four social media
05:12 - platforms over here that we have defined
05:14 - and then guys we also have to provide
05:16 - the value attribute over here because
05:19 - this is the value that is going to be
05:21 - passed to the server and server will
05:23 - differentiate between all these list of
05:25 - values by using the value inside this
05:28 - value attribute so basically we are
05:30 - going to Simply have YouTube as the
05:32 - value over here and we can also have
05:35 - Facebook in this case as the value of
05:37 - the second option and then over here we
05:40 - have Instagram and for the last option
05:42 - we will simply have Twitter so guys
05:44 - basically these are nothing but the
05:45 - values that we have provided and these
05:48 - values will be used on the server side
05:50 - when the user clicks on the submit
05:52 - button these values will be passed for
05:54 - the list of options and guys the text
05:56 - that we have provided that is YouTube
05:58 - Facebook in Instagram and Twitter over
06:00 - here this will be displayed at the UI
06:03 - site to the user so let me just save
06:05 - this file now and try reloading this
06:07 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:09 - can see we are getting a drop down field
06:12 - over here and we need to click on this
06:13 - drop down field and we will get all the
06:16 - options in this case so by default the
06:18 - first option is selected over here and
06:20 - when we click on this we can select one
06:23 - of the options so let's say we select
06:24 - Instagram over here so when we click on
06:27 - this so Instagram is selected in this
06:29 - case so guys basically whatever value is
06:31 - being selected over here it will be
06:33 - passed to the server for further
06:35 - processing and again we can have the
06:36 - label over here so after this BR line
06:39 - break we will have another line break
06:41 - over here and let's say we provide the
06:43 - label in this case and this label should
06:45 - belong to this select tag over here so
06:48 - I'll just copy the ID of the select tag
06:50 - and paste it over here and then we will
06:52 - say social media platforms over here so
06:57 - guys we have social media platforms and
06:59 - then we will again have the line break
07:01 - so that all the options are being
07:02 - displayed on the next line let me just
07:04 - save this file now and try reloading
07:06 - this page once again on the browser so
07:08 - as you can see we are getting the social
07:10 - media platforms over here now guys by
07:12 - default the first option will be
07:14 - selected that is YouTube so how do we
07:16 - make this second option that is Facebook
07:19 - as selected over here so simply what we
07:21 - can do is we can come to this option
07:23 - that is Facebook and after the value
07:26 - inside the starting tag we can simply
07:28 - provide selected attribute over here so
07:31 - as you can see if present this Boolean
07:34 - attribute indicates that the option is
07:36 - initially selected so we simply provide
07:39 - this selected option over here let me
07:41 - just save this file now and when we
07:43 - reload this page by default you will be
07:45 - seeing the Facebook option that is
07:47 - selected in this case so when we reload
07:50 - this page as you can see Facebook is
07:52 - being selected by default and then you
07:54 - have to click on this option and then
07:56 - you will see all the list of items that
07:58 - are present in the drop down so guys
08:00 - whatever option you want to display by
08:03 - default as selected option you can
08:05 - provide the selected keyword over here
08:07 - in order to show that particular option
08:10 - selected by default so over here we have
08:12 - selected Twitter in this case let me
08:14 - just save this file now and try
08:15 - reloading this page so as you can see
08:17 - Twitter is being selected by default
08:19 - over here guys similarly for the input
08:21 - field we can also have the value
08:24 - attribute over here so when we provide
08:26 - the value attribute we need to provide C
08:29 - string over here so let's say we provide
08:31 - test as the string to the value
08:33 - attribute let me just save this file now
08:35 - so guys basically this test string will
08:37 - be displayed by default when the user
08:40 - reloads this page so when we reload this
08:42 - page as you can see test is the YouTube
08:44 - channel name by default and then user
08:47 - can provide the name of the YouTube
08:48 - channel based on the requirements now
08:50 - guys apart from this we have something
08:52 - called as text area which is the
08:54 - multi-line input field so guys we can
08:57 - have the multiple line input field field
08:59 - as well if you are expecting a long
09:01 - input from the user such as a feedback
09:04 - or the remarks input so guys what we
09:06 - have to do is inside the VSS code over
09:09 - here we have something called as text
09:11 - area so as you can see this is the tag
09:14 - and then we can provide the name such as
09:16 - we can provide remarks over here and
09:18 - then again the ID that we are going to
09:21 - provide is remarks in this case and then
09:23 - guys we have something called as rows
09:25 - and calls over here so this is going to
09:27 - define the number of rows meaning how
09:29 - many number of rows vertically the text
09:32 - area will occupy the space and then
09:34 - horizontally how many columns the text
09:36 - area will be occupying the space so over
09:39 - here by default the rows are 10 and the
09:42 - columns are 30 in this case and then
09:44 - guys before this we can also have the
09:46 - label that is assigned to this text area
09:48 - so simply we will have the label and for
09:51 - the for attribute we are going to
09:53 - provide the ID of this text area so I'll
09:55 - simply copy the remarks ID and paste it
09:58 - over here and then simply we will
10:00 - provide the remarks label over here
10:02 - followed by colon and then we also have
10:05 - the line break over here at the end of
10:07 - the label and guys in between the text
10:09 - area text we can provide the hint to the
10:12 - user we can say provide your remarks so
10:17 - guys let me just save this file now and
10:19 - try reloading this page once again on
10:21 - the browser so as you can see this is
10:23 - the multi-line input field that is
10:25 - expandable over here so guys on the
10:27 - bottom right as you can see when you get
10:29 - the cursor it gets converted to this
10:31 - Arrow cursor over here and we can simply
10:34 - click it and drag it to the appropriate
10:36 - point so that we can increase or
10:38 - decrease the size of this particular
10:40 - text area and this is the hint that is
10:42 - provided to the user we can provide the
10:44 - remarks over here and we can simply say
10:47 - this is programming for beginner YouTube
10:53 - channel which I have subscribed so guys
10:57 - basically this is the multi line input
10:59 - that can be provided by the user with
11:02 - the help of the text area HTML element
11:05 - now guys apart from this we also have
11:07 - the button form element over here which
11:09 - will help us in order to display the
11:11 - clickable button so what we can do is
11:13 - simply inside this form we can have the
11:16 - input tag over here followed by colon
11:19 - and then we have something called as
11:21 - button in this case so guys basically
11:23 - the type will be button so we have
11:25 - already seen the type that is text which
11:27 - is the input field the type button will
11:29 - be a clickable button and the value will
11:32 - be provided over here inside the value
11:34 - attribute which will be displayed on the
11:37 - button itself so for the value attribute
11:39 - we can simply say click me over here
11:41 - followed by exclamation mark So guys let
11:43 - me just save this file now and try
11:45 - reloading this page once again on the
11:47 - browser so as you can see we have this
11:49 - click me button which is being displayed
11:51 - on the right and when we click on this
11:53 - since we have not added any JavaScript
11:56 - code over here nothing will happen but
11:58 - we can simply click on this particular
12:00 - button and based on our requirements
12:02 - carry out the actions that we want to
12:04 - perform now simply we can have the line
12:06 - break after this text area so that the
12:08 - button is displayed on the next line
12:10 - over here so let me just save this file
12:12 - now and try reloading this page so as
12:15 - you can see over here we are getting the
12:17 - button that is being displayed on the UI
12:19 - now guys apart from this we have
12:21 - something called as field set and the
12:23 - legend as well which helps us in order
12:25 - to group the form elements and provide
12:27 - name to the form so guys this entire
12:30 - form that we have seen just now right
12:32 - from the YouTube channel name and then
12:34 - we have social media platforms which is
12:36 - the select element and then we have the
12:38 - remarks which is the text area and then
12:41 - we also have the button this entire form
12:43 - can be enclosed in between the field set
12:46 - which is nothing but grouping of the
12:48 - form elements so what we can do is we
12:51 - can have the field set tag over here so
12:54 - guys what we are going to do is first of
12:55 - all I'm going to set the word rep so
12:58 - that all the content is being displayed
13:00 - on this screen instead of using the
13:02 - horizontal scroll bar now after this
13:04 - form element over here we can simply
13:06 - have the field set in this case so this
13:09 - is the field set tag over here and I'll
13:12 - cut this field set ending tag and paste
13:15 - it after the last input that is the
13:17 - button over here now let me just save
13:19 - this file now and try reloading this
13:21 - page once again on the browser so as you
13:23 - can see we are getting a border in this
13:25 - case and this is defining our form that
13:28 - is all the form elements are present
13:30 - inside this border now guys we can also
13:33 - give the name to this form that will be
13:35 - displayed over here along with the
13:37 - border so what we can do is we can have
13:39 - the legend tag over here so we provide
13:42 - Legend tag and we simply have to provide
13:44 - the name of the form so let's say we
13:47 - provide the name of the form as test
13:48 - form over here so let me just save this
13:50 - file now and try reloading this page on
13:53 - the browser so as you can see along with
13:55 - the Border we are getting the name that
13:57 - is test form over here with the help of
13:59 - the legend tag so guys this is the main
14:01 - functionality of the field set which
14:04 - will help us in order to group the
14:06 - entire content of the form and the
14:08 - legend tag that will give the name to
14:10 - that particular form so guys apart from
14:12 - this we also have something called as
14:14 - data list over here which will help us
14:16 - in order to display the list of the
14:18 - drop- down options so guys what we will
14:20 - do is after this button we are going to
14:23 - have the data list over here so guys
14:25 - basically we are going to have the input
14:27 - tag over here and for this input tag
14:30 - instead of having the type attribute we
14:32 - will be having the list attribute so
14:34 - over here we will say list and we will
14:36 - give some value to this list so let's
14:38 - say we provide the browsers as the value
14:41 - to this list now guys we are supposed to
14:43 - define the list of browsers which will
14:46 - be displayed as the drop- down for this
14:48 - input list over here so what we can do
14:50 - is on the next line we can have the data
14:53 - list as the tag in this case and guys
14:55 - for this data list tag we are going to
14:57 - have the ID which will be equal to the
15:00 - value of this list attribute for this
15:03 - input so I'm going to copy this and
15:05 - paste it as the ID over here and in
15:07 - between this data list starting and the
15:09 - ending tag we are going to have the list
15:12 - of options so let's say the first option
15:14 - over here is Chrome in this case and the
15:17 - value that we are going to provide is
15:19 - Google Chrome over here so we say Google
15:22 - Chrome and then after this we will have
15:24 - more options over here so we will say
15:27 - another browser as Firefox and then
15:30 - let's say we provide Safari as the third
15:33 - option and then let's say we have Edge
15:35 - as the fourth option so let's say over
15:37 - here we say Firefox Guys these values
15:40 - will be displayed on the UI that we
15:42 - provide in between the starting and the
15:44 - ending tag and the values that we
15:46 - provide will be passed to the server so
15:48 - over here we have Safari as the third
15:51 - browser and then we have MS Edge that is
15:55 - Microsoft Edge as the fourth option over
15:58 - here now guys let me just save this file
16:00 - now and try reloading this page once
16:02 - again on the browser so as you can see
16:04 - we have CAU another input field over
16:06 - here and you can see there is a drop-
16:08 - down option in this case so when we
16:10 - click on this drop down option as you
16:12 - can see these are the options that we
16:14 - are getting so guys we are getting the
16:16 - value as well along with it the text
16:18 - that we had given that is Chrome over
16:20 - here for Google Chrome and then we are
16:22 - getting Firefox Safari and Edge so guys
16:25 - this is another way in order to show the
16:27 - list of options by using the data list
16:30 - and binding it with the input tag by
16:33 - using the list attribute which will have
16:36 - the value as the ID of the data list tag
16:39 - so Guys these are certain form elements
16:41 - that you can use based on your
16:42 - requirements comment in the comment
