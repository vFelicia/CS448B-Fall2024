00:00 - so now we will see input type number in
00:02 - HTML form so guys basically the input
00:05 - tag along with the type number defines a
00:09 - numeric input field which will allow the
00:11 - user to only provide the numbers in this
00:14 - input field now you can also set the
00:17 - restrictions on what numbers are
00:19 - accepted so guys we will check this with
00:22 - the help of examples as well with the
00:24 - help of Min and Max attributes so let us
00:27 - move to the vs code over here and
00:29 - previously we we had seen the different
00:31 - input types such as file and then hidden
00:33 - and the month type as well now we will
00:36 - provide another input field over here
00:38 - and this time we will have the type as
00:40 - number in this case so when we press
00:42 - enter as you can see the type is being
00:44 - defined as number over here and for the
00:47 - name field we will provide it as age
00:49 - because we will ask the user in order to
00:51 - provide the age of the user so guys the
00:54 - same value we will copy it as the ID as
00:56 - well for this particular input field and
00:58 - before this we will also have the label
01:00 - tag over here and for the four attribute
01:03 - we will have the value as age so that
01:05 - the user can click on this label and
01:08 - provide the number to this input field
01:10 - in this case so we will provide the
01:12 - label as provide your age in ear
01:17 - followed by colon and then after this
01:19 - input tag we will also have the couple
01:21 - of line breaks so that the submit button
01:23 - is displayed on the next line so guys
01:26 - let me just save this file now and try
01:28 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:30 - you can see provide your age and years
01:33 - is being displayed over here and the
01:34 - user will not be allowed to provide any
01:37 - of the alphabets or the special
01:39 - characters in this case that's because
01:41 - we have provided the input field with
01:44 - the type number which means it will only
01:46 - accept the numbers in this particular
01:49 - input field so guys over here let's say
01:51 - if I provide some string in this case so
01:54 - I'm not able to type the characters and
01:56 - only the numbers are being displayed
01:58 - over here let us try the special
02:00 - characters so over here I'm typing the
02:02 - special characters as well but it is not
02:04 - being displayed over here that's because
02:06 - the input field will only accept numbers
02:08 - in this case so let's say we provide the
02:11 - number as 105 in this case and when we
02:14 - click on submit button over here you can
02:16 - see that the age attribute is being
02:18 - displayed inside the URL with the value
02:20 - of 105 over here now guys over here we
02:23 - can provide any number in this case
02:25 - let's say we provide 10,05 over here and
02:29 - click on submit so basically it is
02:31 - submitting that value but for the age
02:33 - Factor we need to restrict the numbers
02:35 - so that the user can specify the age in
02:37 - between two numbers over here the user
02:40 - can also provide a negative number in
02:41 - this case so when we go down over here
02:44 - as you can see negative numbers can also
02:46 - be displayed over here and we can
02:48 - increase this number as well so guys
02:50 - basically you can use these arrows in
02:52 - order to increment or decrement the
02:54 - numbers as well but guys let us put some
02:56 - restrictions over here so the minimum
02:59 - age that we want is 18 in this case and
03:01 - the maximum age is 60 over here so we
03:04 - provide the m and the max attributes
03:06 - over here so as you can see the main
03:08 - attribute is equal to 18 and the max
03:10 - attribute is 60 in this case let me just
03:12 - save this file now and try reloading
03:14 - this page once again on the browser so
03:16 - now we will be able to restrict the age
03:18 - in between the 18 and the 60 numbers so
03:22 - as you can see when we are decreasing
03:23 - the number from 18 it is not decreasing
03:26 - so 18 is the minimum value that we can
03:29 - provide and 60 will be the maximum value
03:31 - so when we provide 59 and increase this
03:34 - number it is going to 60 and then when
03:36 - we click on the Arrow once again so it
03:38 - is not incrementing the value and when
03:41 - we click on the submit button the age is
03:43 - being taken as 60 over here and what if
03:45 - we provide a number which is greater
03:47 - than 60 manually so let's say we provide
03:49 - 67 over here and when we click on submit
03:52 - as you can see we are getting the
03:53 - validation value must be less than or
03:56 - equal to 60 so basically this is the
03:58 - validation which will be display played
03:59 - for the minimum number as well so when
04:02 - we provide 15 over here and click on
04:04 - submit so value must be greater than or
04:06 - equal to 18 over here so this is the
04:09 - validation that is automatically
04:10 - provided by the input field with the
04:13 - type number over here when we provide
04:15 - the Min and the max numbers in this case
04:17 - guys apart from this we can also have
04:19 - the step attribute which will increment
04:22 - or decrement the value by that
04:24 - particular step value over here so let's
04:26 - say we provide five as the step value
04:29 - let me just say this file now and try
04:30 - reloading this page once again on the
04:32 - browser and now if we provide any of the
04:34 - number so let's say we provide 18 over
04:36 - here and when we increment it by one so
04:39 - over here when we press on this upper
04:41 - Arrow as you can see the next number is
04:43 - 23 that's because we have provided the
04:46 - step as five by default the step is set
04:49 - as one over here so that the user can
04:51 - increment or decrement the value by one
04:54 - but you can change that step value and
04:56 - we have set it as five over here in this
04:58 - case so that that is the reason why when
05:00 - we increment the value the value is
05:02 - getting increased by five and when we
05:04 - decrement the value the value is
05:06 - decreasing by five and that is how we
05:08 - can set the attributes that is min max
05:10 - and the step value as well apart from
05:12 - this we can also have the default value
05:14 - by setting the value attribute over here
05:16 - so let's say the default age of the user
05:19 - is 25 in this case so we provide the
05:22 - value as 25 let me just save this file
05:24 - now and try reloading this page so as
05:27 - you can see by default you will be able
05:29 - to see the age is 25 so guys comment in
