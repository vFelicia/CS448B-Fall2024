00:00 - so now we will see string in JavaScript
00:02 - so guys basically string is a text that
00:05 - can be assigned or stored inside the
00:07 - variable and this we are going to check
00:09 - with the help of examples as well so
00:11 - this is the syntax that you can define a
00:14 - particular string so as you can see we
00:16 - have used the const keyword over here
00:18 - followed by the name of the variable
00:20 - that is Str Str now guys this particular
00:22 - variable will be a string when you
00:24 - provide the value on the left hand side
00:27 - which is enclosed in between the double
00:29 - quote over here so as you can see this
00:32 - particular value that is programming for
00:33 - beginners is enclosed in between the
00:36 - double codes and that is why the data
00:38 - type of this particular variable will be
00:40 - string over here now guys you can either
00:43 - use the double codes or the single code
00:45 - or you can also use the back take so all
00:48 - these we are going to check with the
00:49 - help of examples as well so let us move
00:52 - to the vs code over here so first of all
00:54 - let us Define the variable by using the
00:57 - const keyword so let's say we provide
00:59 - the variable name as Str Str that is
01:01 - string over here equal to and then we
01:03 - need to provide the value inside the
01:05 - double codes over here so guys basically
01:08 - we provide the value that is programming
01:10 - for beginners that is the name of this
01:12 - YouTube channel that you should
01:13 - subscribe if you have not done so we
01:15 - have provided the value that is
01:16 - programming for beginners in between the
01:18 - double Cotes over here let us print the
01:21 - type of this particular string variable
01:24 - so simply we can use the type of
01:26 - operator over here and then followed by
01:29 - the name of the variable that is Str Str
01:31 - so guys basically this particular log
01:34 - statement will help us in order to print
01:36 - the data type of this particular
01:38 - variable so let me just save this file
01:40 - now and try running this code by using
01:42 - the node command on the terminal so we
01:45 - provide node followed by space character
01:47 - and then the name of the Javascript file
01:49 - that is test.js so when we press enter
01:52 - as you can see we are getting the string
01:55 - data type over here that's because we
01:57 - have provided the value in between the
01:59 - double code over here and simply in
02:01 - order to print the string what we can do
02:03 - is again we can provide the console. log
02:06 - statement and this time we will provide
02:08 - the name of the variable that is St Str
02:11 - so let me just save this file now and
02:13 - try running this code once again over
02:15 - here so as you can see the data type is
02:17 - string and then we are getting the value
02:19 - of the string that is programming for
02:21 - beginners over here instead of using the
02:23 - double codes simply we can use the
02:25 - single quote as well so instead of
02:27 - providing double quote we are providing
02:29 - single Cote so over here so when we run
02:31 - this code once again we are not going to
02:33 - see any change as far as the output is
02:35 - concerned that's because it is same
02:37 - whether you provide the double codes or
02:39 - the single code when you are defining
02:41 - the string value now guys apart from
02:43 - this you can also concatenate two string
02:46 - by using the plus operator over here
02:48 - when you're using numbers the plus
02:50 - operator is used in order to add two or
02:53 - multiple numbers but when you're using
02:55 - string data type the plus operator will
02:58 - be used in order to join the two strings
03:01 - so guys let us Define another string
03:03 - over here so let's say we provide const
03:05 - and then Str str1 it is equal to and
03:08 - this time we provide YouTube channel
03:10 - over here so we have YouTube channel as
03:13 - the string and before the YouTube key
03:15 - word we provideed the space character
03:17 - since we are going to join both the
03:19 - string that is Str Str and St str1 so
03:22 - guys what we will do is simply I'm going
03:24 - to comment out this line of code over
03:26 - here and then again we are going to
03:28 - provide the console. log statement this
03:31 - time we will say St Str and then we will
03:33 - use the plus operator in order to join
03:36 - both the strings so guys basically this
03:38 - is the concatenation of two strings
03:40 - meaning we are joining two strings with
03:42 - the help of the plus operator and then
03:44 - on the right hand side we provide Str
03:46 - str1 the number of variables is not
03:48 - limited to two over here you can use as
03:51 - many times the plus operator as you want
03:53 - based on the requirements and provide
03:55 - the variable names that are having the
03:57 - string values so guys over here we are
03:59 - joining the Str Str and St str1 let us
04:02 - see what will be the output so let me
04:03 - just save this file now and try running
04:06 - this code once again on the browser as
04:08 - you can see we are getting programming
04:09 - for beginners YouTube channel so guys
04:12 - basically we have joined these two
04:14 - string values over here with the help of
04:16 - the concatenation operator that is the
04:18 - plus operator over here and in this way
04:20 - you can join two or multiple number of
04:22 - string values now guys apart from this
04:24 - you can also provide the codes inside
04:27 - the codes in a string over here so
04:29 - basically we are using single code over
04:31 - here in order to enclose the entire
04:33 - string let us say we want to provide
04:35 - double codes inside this string which is
04:38 - enclosed with the help of the single
04:40 - code so let me just comment out this
04:42 - line of code over here so what we will
04:44 - do is let's say we provide programming
04:46 - for beginners and then over here we want
04:48 - to provide YouTube channel within the
04:51 - double codes inside the first string
04:53 - over here so simply we provide the
04:55 - double codes over here and then we
04:57 - provide YouTube channel as the string
04:59 - value so guys basically the entire
05:01 - string value is enclosed within the
05:03 - single code over here and this time we
05:05 - can use the double code since the main
05:07 - string is enclosed within the single
05:09 - code let me just save this file now and
05:11 - try running this code once again on the
05:13 - browser so we have not provided any log
05:15 - statement over here so I'll just
05:17 - uncomment this line of code so that we
05:19 - are able to see the value of the string
05:21 - variable so let me just run this code
05:23 - once again as you can see programming
05:25 - for beginners and then the YouTube
05:27 - channel is enclosed in between the
05:29 - Double C code and in this way you can
05:31 - provide the double code inside the
05:33 - single code now guys can you provide
05:35 - double code inside the double code no in
05:37 - this case so if you try to provide
05:39 - double codes as the main special
05:41 - character that is enclosing the entire
05:44 - string so basically as you can see we
05:45 - are getting the error over here so in
05:48 - this case you have to provide single
05:49 - code over here so basically instead of
05:52 - double code for the YouTube channel we
05:54 - are providing single code over here so
05:56 - this time instead of having double code
05:58 - for this YouTube channel we will will
05:59 - get the single codes so let me just save
06:01 - this file now and try running this code
06:03 - once again so as you can see we are
06:05 - getting programming for beginners and
06:07 - then single quote over here since we are
06:09 - using the double quote as the main
06:11 - special character to enclose the entire
06:14 - string value over here now guys apart
06:16 - from this you can also use the template
06:18 - strings with the help of the backt so
06:20 - when you're using the back te you can
06:22 - provide the single quote and double
06:24 - quote inside the string value over here
06:26 - so let us check that as well so guys
06:28 - over here what we will do is let us say
06:30 - we provide backt over here that is the
06:33 - starting and the ending backt and then
06:35 - we will say programming for beginners
06:39 - but guys over here we want the
06:40 - programming for beginners to be present
06:42 - inside the double code so simply we can
06:45 - provide the double code which will
06:46 - enclose the programming for beginner
06:48 - string over here and then we have the
06:50 - YouTube channel which must be present in
06:52 - between the single code so over here we
06:54 - provide two times single codes and then
06:56 - we provide YouTube channel over here so
06:59 - basically this backt which is enclosing
07:02 - the main string over here will help us
07:04 - in order to provide both that is double
07:07 - quote as well as the single code this
07:09 - time so let me just save this file now
07:11 - and try running this code once again
07:12 - over here so as you can see we are
07:14 - getting programming for beginners
07:16 - between the double codes and then inside
07:18 - the single code we are getting the
07:20 - YouTube channel over here so guys you
07:22 - can also use the template string over
07:24 - here which means by using the back tap
07:26 - you can represent the string value this
07:29 - back tap also helps you in order to
07:31 - include the value of the other variable
07:33 - as well so what we can do is let us say
07:35 - we provide certain number over here with
07:38 - the help of the X variable and let us
07:40 - say we provide the number as one in this
07:42 - case so guys basically we want to append
07:44 - this number that is one inside the
07:46 - strings so what we will do is
07:48 - programming for beginners YouTube
07:49 - channel and then after this we want to
07:51 - provide hyphen and then the value of
07:53 - this number so how do we provide the
07:55 - value of the X inside this particular
07:57 - string so basically since we are using
07:59 - back Teck over here simply we can use
08:02 - the dollar symbol and then inside the
08:04 - open and close curly braces we can use
08:06 - the name of the variable that is x in
08:09 - this case so guys basically this is
08:11 - going to print the value of the variable
08:13 - that is X so let me just save this file
08:15 - now and try running this code once again
08:17 - over here so as you can see programming
08:19 - for beginners YouTube channel and then
08:21 - we are getting the value that is one
08:23 - over here so guys in this way it becomes
08:25 - very important when you use back tap in
08:28 - order to represent the Str Str value now
08:30 - guys apart from this you can also find
08:32 - the length of the string by using the
08:34 - length property over here so basically
08:36 - what this length property will do is it
08:39 - is going to print the number of
08:41 - characters that are present inside a
08:43 - particular string so guys let me just
08:45 - change the string value over here to
08:47 - test in this case so basically it is
08:49 - having four characters over here I'll
08:51 - also remove this line of code since it
08:53 - is not required for now so guys
08:55 - basically we are printing the test
08:57 - string over here so let me just save
08:59 - this file now and try running this code
09:01 - once again so as you can see we are
09:02 - getting the value that is test now let's
09:04 - say we want to find the number of
09:06 - characters that are present inside this
09:08 - string value so what we have to do is we
09:10 - need to make use of this Str Str
09:12 - variable over here followed by Dot and
09:15 - then we have something called as length
09:16 - over here so guys basically this length
09:19 - property will help us in order to get
09:21 - the number of the characters that are
09:24 - present inside this particular string
09:26 - value so when we save this file now and
09:28 - try running this code once again over
09:29 - here as you can see we are getting
09:31 - number four as the length of the string
09:33 - so in this way you can get the number of
09:35 - characters that are present inside the
09:37 - string value let's say we provide more
09:39 - string value over here as the test data
09:42 - so as you can see now there are nine
09:44 - number of characters inside this
09:45 - particular string let us verify that
09:47 - with the help of this length property
09:49 - over here so when we run this code once
09:51 - again so as you can see we are getting 9
09:53 - as the length of this particular string
09:56 - variable now guys apart from this you
09:58 - can also use the Escape characters
10:00 - inside the string value so guys over
10:02 - here what we had seen previously is
10:05 - inside the double codes you cannot
10:07 - provide more double quotes over here so
10:09 - if we try to provide a double quote in
10:11 - this case so as you can see we are
10:13 - getting the error but let's say if you
10:15 - want to provide the double quat within
10:17 - this main double quat over here which is
10:19 - enclosing the entire string so what you
10:21 - can do is simply you can use the Escape
10:24 - character which means you need to
10:26 - provide an additional back slash
10:28 - character over here here before the
10:30 - special character that you have provided
10:32 - so guys this is nothing but the Escape
10:34 - character that will help you in order to
10:37 - print the special characters which
10:39 - cannot be printed normally so let me
10:41 - just run this code once again we will
10:43 - print the value of the string variable
10:45 - over here so when we see the output as
10:48 - you can see test and then followed by
10:51 - the double quote over here and then we
10:52 - have the data in this case similarly we
10:54 - can have other special characters as
10:56 - well so we have the single code over
10:58 - here so again again in between the test
11:00 - data there will be single code that will
11:02 - be printed over here let's say if you
11:04 - want to print a back slash character so
11:06 - simply you provide a back slash
11:08 - character once and then again you
11:10 - provide the backs slash character so the
11:12 - first back slash character is the escape
11:14 - character over here let me just save
11:16 - this file now and only once the back
11:18 - slash character will be visible over
11:20 - here which is the second back slash
11:21 - character in this case so guys in this
11:23 - way you can use the Escape characters as
11:25 - well we can also compare the strings as
11:28 - well so what will do is let's say we
11:30 - have the string character that is a over
11:33 - here and we want to see whether a is
11:35 - greater than another character that is B
11:37 - so guys over here we are using the two
11:39 - string values that is having this one
11:41 - character that is a and b over here so
11:44 - is a greater than b no in this case so
11:46 - let us see what will be the output so
11:48 - when we run this code over here as you
11:50 - can see we are getting false in this
11:52 - case but let us say we change the value
11:54 - of the left hand side string to C over
11:57 - here so is C greater than b yes in this
11:59 - case so let me just save this file now
12:01 - and try running this code so as you can
12:03 - see we are getting true as the output so
12:05 - guys we can use any of the comparison
12:07 - operators in order to compare the two
12:09 - string values as well now apart from
12:12 - this we can also access the string by
12:14 - using the open and close square brackets
12:16 - over here so guys let us say we have the
12:19 - string value that is test data and let's
12:21 - say we want to access the first
12:23 - character over here so we only want the
12:25 - first letter that is T to be printed on
12:28 - the console so so guys what we will do
12:30 - is simply we use the St Str that is the
12:32 - name of the variable and then inside the
12:35 - open and close square brackets this
12:37 - particular T is being represented by the
12:39 - zero index over here so the count starts
12:42 - from zero and then the next letter that
12:44 - is e is represented by one and then we
12:46 - have two which represents the S
12:48 - character and then we have 3 4 5 and so
12:51 - on simply we need to provide the index
12:53 - number that is zero over here so guys
12:55 - let me just save this file now and try
12:57 - running this code once again on the
12:58 - console so as you can see we are getting
13:01 - the first letter that is T over here in
13:03 - order to access the second letter that
13:05 - is e over here simply we need to change
13:07 - the index number to one so let me just
13:09 - save this file now and try running this
13:11 - code once again over here so as you can
13:13 - see we are getting e letter printed over
13:15 - here on the terminal now guys what will
13:17 - be the output if we provide St Str and
13:20 - Then followed by the index number that
13:22 - is five over here so comment in the
13:24 - comment section below what will be the
13:26 - output of this particular log statement
13:28 - when we have this string value that is
13:30 - test data over here let us see whether
13:32 - your answer is correct or not please
