00:00 - so now we will see resize property in
00:02 - CSS so guys basically the resize
00:05 - property specifies if and how an HTML
00:08 - element should be resizable by the user
00:10 - so guys sometimes based on your project
00:12 - requirements you want the user to resize
00:15 - the text field or any other HTML element
00:18 - that is displayed on the user so in that
00:21 - case you can use the resize property in
00:23 - order to allow the user to resize the
00:25 - HTML element it is very important to
00:28 - note that the Overflow property is
00:30 - required to make use of resize property
00:32 - so guys let us check this with the help
00:34 - of examples in VSS code over here so
00:36 - simply I'm going to remove the previous
00:38 - lines of code that we have written in
00:40 - the HTML and the CSS files now guys let
00:42 - us say we have the diff tag over here
00:45 - which is having certain random text that
00:47 - is getting generated in this case so we
00:49 - have the lurm Mt abbreviation and let's
00:51 - say we have 30 words over here that are
00:53 - getting displayed right now now guys let
00:55 - me just save this file now and try
00:57 - reloading this page on the browser to
00:59 - see how it looks like so as you can see
01:01 - this is the text that is getting
01:03 - generated right now so guys what we will
01:05 - do is we will display this text inside
01:07 - the box which is having a specific width
01:09 - so inside the style. CSS file over here
01:12 - simply we are going to provide the diff
01:14 - tag and let's say it is having the width
01:16 - of 500 pixels in this case and then
01:18 - apart from this we will also have the
01:20 - border of let's say 1 pixel solid of the
01:23 - color gray in this case so let us have
01:26 - the border of one pixel with the gray
01:27 - color and then apart from this we will
01:29 - also to provide the padding of 10 pixels
01:32 - so that there is certain spacing in
01:34 - between the border and the content of
01:36 - this D tag let me just save this file
01:38 - now and try reloading this page once
01:40 - again on the browser so as you can see
01:42 - we have this diff tag with the border
01:44 - and the content inside this diff tag now
01:46 - guys let's say we want the user to
01:48 - increase or decrease the width of this
01:50 - diff tag so what we can do is simply we
01:53 - can provide the resize property over
01:55 - here so we have the resize CSS property
01:57 - in this case that can be used in order
02:00 - to increase the decrease the width and
02:02 - when we say horizontal as the value it
02:04 - will allow the user to change the width
02:06 - and when we say vertical it will allow
02:09 - the user to change the height of the
02:11 - HTML element so let us say we provide
02:13 - the value as horizontal let me just save
02:15 - this file now and try reloading this
02:17 - page once again on the browser so notice
02:19 - that on the bottom right we don't have
02:21 - anything which will allow the user to
02:23 - increase or decrease the width so guys
02:25 - why this is happening because we have
02:27 - not provided the Overflow property which
02:30 - is required in order to make the use of
02:32 - resize property so simply we are going
02:35 - to make use of the Overflow property and
02:37 - simply we can set the value as Auto over
02:40 - here let me just save this file now and
02:42 - try reloading this page once again on
02:44 - the browser so as you can see on the
02:46 - bottom right we can simply click and
02:48 - drag the border of this div tag in order
02:51 - to increase or decrease the width of
02:53 - this particular HTML element so guys in
02:55 - this way you can use the resize property
02:58 - over here now guys apart from this we
03:00 - can also have the value as vertical in
03:02 - which case the user will be allowed to
03:04 - update the height of the diff tag let me
03:07 - just save this file now and try
03:08 - reloading this page once again on the
03:10 - browser now if you see user will be able
03:12 - to increase or decrease the height of
03:15 - this particular di tag and automatically
03:17 - there will be a scroll bar if the text
03:19 - is not getting displayed within the
03:21 - height of the diff tag over here so in
03:23 - this way you can provide the vertical
03:25 - value to the reiz CSS property as well
03:28 - and then apart from this in order to
03:29 - have both that is horizontal and
03:31 - vertical value which means the user
03:33 - should be allowed to update the width
03:36 - and height as well of this HTML element
03:38 - then simply you can provide the both
03:40 - value to the resize CSS property let me
03:43 - just save this file now and try
03:44 - reloading this page now if you see the
03:46 - user will be able to increase the width
03:48 - as well as the height of this diff tag
03:50 - and automatically there will be a scroll
03:52 - bar that will appear when the content of
03:55 - the diff tag is not within the borders
03:57 - of this particular diff tag in this case
03:59 - so guys in this way simply you can use
04:01 - the resize property in order to allow
04:03 - the user to update the width and height
04:06 - of any HTML element based on your
04:08 - project requirement so guys comment in
