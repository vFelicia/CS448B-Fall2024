00:00 - so now we will see ordered list in HTML
00:03 - so guys HTML ordered list is used to
00:06 - group a set of related items in list and
00:09 - they will be having a particular order
00:11 - in which we Define them now guys an
00:14 - ordered list starts with the o tag over
00:17 - here so we have the less than symbol
00:19 - followed by o which is ordered list and
00:22 - Then followed by the greater than symbol
00:24 - and then inside the list each list item
00:27 - starts with the Alli tag in this case so
00:30 - guys the list items will be marked with
00:32 - numbers by default so let us check this
00:34 - with the help of examples in vs code
00:36 - over here so guys previously we had
00:38 - return the unordered list items in this
00:41 - case and this is how the unordered list
00:44 - items looks on the web browser now guys
00:47 - what we will be doing is we will Define
00:49 - the ordered list as well below this
00:50 - unordered list so simply we are going to
00:53 - have a paragraph and then we will say
00:55 - below content is in ordered list we have
00:59 - a very simil simple statement that is
01:01 - below content is in ordered list now
01:03 - guys we can simply use the o tag over
01:05 - here so when we type O as you can see
01:08 - this is the starting o tag and the
01:10 - ending o tag so in between these o tags
01:13 - we will be defining our list items so we
01:16 - can simply have the Ali starting and the
01:18 - ending tag over here and then guys let's
01:21 - say we want to have the list of
01:23 - programming languages over here in a
01:25 - particular order so let's say we Define
01:27 - the first list item as python and then
01:30 - we copy and paste this line of code to
01:32 - the remaining lines and then let's say
01:34 - we have another programming language
01:36 - that is Java and then let's say we have
01:38 - C++ over here and then let's say we have
01:41 - dot in this case guys we have taken
01:43 - these programming languages just for the
01:45 - example to show how the list items will
01:47 - be displayed in the ordered list it
01:50 - doesn't mean that python is ranked
01:52 - number one over here and Java is ranked
01:54 - number two over here this is just for
01:56 - the example purpose and all of the
01:58 - programming languages have their own
02:00 - advantages and disadvantages so let me
02:02 - just save this file now and try
02:04 - reloading this page once again on the
02:06 - browser so as you can see we have the
02:08 - paragraph that is below content is in
02:10 - ordered list and then we have all the
02:12 - programming languages that we have
02:14 - listed python Java C++ and Dot so guys
02:18 - as I have told you this is not the
02:20 - rankings that we are giving to the
02:21 - programming languages you can learn
02:23 - based on your interest and each and
02:26 - every programming language have their
02:27 - own advantages and disadvantages an ages
02:30 - and if you want to learn more about
02:31 - Python and Java programming languages I
02:34 - have created lot of videos related to
02:36 - the tutorials of these programming
02:38 - languages along with it we have also
02:40 - covered multiple Python and Java
02:43 - programs with the help of examples so
02:45 - guys you can watch all those videos
02:47 - which I have added in the playlist the
02:49 - links I have given Below in the
02:50 - description section so guys this is a
02:52 - way in order to display the ordered list
02:55 - in this case wherein by default we get
02:57 - the numbers that is 1 2 3 4 and so on
03:01 - based on the number of list items in
03:03 - this case now guys we can also have the
03:05 - type attribute inside the o tag in order
03:08 - to mention how the list items should be
03:11 - displayed so by default as you can see
03:13 - over here the numbers are being
03:15 - displayed in this case but we can also
03:17 - have letters over here so let's say if
03:19 - you want to display all these
03:21 - programming languages with the help of
03:23 - the upper case characters so what we
03:25 - have to do is inside the o tag we have
03:28 - something called as type attribute
03:30 - so as you can see it indicates the
03:32 - numbering type so it can be a lowercase
03:35 - letter or the uppercase letter or it can
03:37 - also have the Roman numerals as well so
03:40 - over here right now we will be using the
03:42 - uppercase letter in this case so let's
03:45 - say we provide capital A over here so
03:47 - let me just save this file now and try
03:49 - reloading this page once again on the
03:51 - browser so as you can see now the
03:53 - programming languages are being numbered
03:55 - with the uppercase characters that is a
03:58 - b c d D and so on so guys similarly we
04:01 - can have the lowercase characters as
04:03 - well over here we need to provide the
04:06 - type that is lowercase a in this case so
04:08 - let me just save this file now and try
04:10 - reloading this page once again on the
04:12 - browser so as you can see we have a b c
04:15 - d and so on the lowercase letters are
04:17 - being displayed and these are used as
04:19 - the numbers for the ordered list we can
04:22 - also have the Roman numbers as well so
04:24 - let's say we provide capital I over here
04:26 - so let me just save this file now and
04:28 - try reloading this page so as you can
04:30 - see these are the Roman numbers 1 2 3 4
04:34 - and so on based on the number of the
04:36 - list items all the Roman numbers will be
04:39 - displayed over here in the ordered list
04:41 - now guys apart from this we also have
04:43 - the start attribute of the o tag so guys
04:46 - let us move to the default numbering
04:48 - system over here so we will change this
04:50 - type value to one in this case let me
04:52 - just save this file now and try
04:54 - reloading this page once again on the
04:56 - browser so we are getting 1 2 3 4 and so
04:59 - on but guys let's say if you want to
05:01 - start with some other number let's say
05:04 - we want to start with the fifth number
05:06 - over here so what we can do is for the o
05:08 - tag we have the start attribute so over
05:11 - here we can provide the start attribute
05:14 - as you can see this integer attribute
05:16 - specifies the start value for the
05:19 - numbering of the individual list items
05:22 - so we can say that whatever value we
05:24 - provide to this start attribute from
05:26 - that value the list items will start so
05:29 - let's say provide the number five in
05:31 - this case let me just save this file now
05:32 - and try reloading this page once again
05:34 - on the browser so as you can see the
05:36 - numbering is starting from the number
05:39 - that is five and then we have 6 7 8 and
05:42 - so on so guys in this way we can easily
05:44 - use the start attribute as well in order
05:47 - to start the ordered list from a
05:49 - particular number now guys we can also
05:50 - have the nested ordered list as well so
05:54 - inside one of the list items we can have
05:56 - another ordered list so let's say inside
05:59 - inside the Java list in this case we
06:01 - want another ordered list over here so
06:04 - what we can do is after the ending tag
06:06 - of this Java list item we come over here
06:09 - and then we provide the ordered list tag
06:12 - that is O and then we again Define the
06:14 - list items and then let's say we want to
06:17 - define the Java versions 19 and 20 so
06:20 - over here we will say Java version 19
06:24 - and then we will have another list item
06:27 - and then we will say Java version 20 in
06:30 - this case as the second list item inside
06:33 - the nested ordered list over here within
06:36 - Java list item so guys let me just save
06:38 - this file now and try reloading this
06:40 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:42 - can see inside this Java list item we
06:45 - have two more elements that we have
06:47 - defined which is again an ordered list
06:49 - over here that is being numbered as 1
06:52 - and two and it is saying Java version 19
06:55 - and Java version 20 in this case so guys
06:57 - in this way we can also have the the
06:59 - nested ordered list over here and based
07:01 - on our requirements we can also have
07:03 - images and other links over here inside
07:06 - of the simple text that we have defined
07:08 - in this ordered list and if you want to
07:10 - have the unordered list over here we can
07:12 - do that as well so instead of using the
07:15 - o tag in this case we can use the UL tag
07:18 - over here which defines the unordered
07:20 - list so we have changed the starting and
07:22 - the ending tag to the unordered list in
07:25 - this case let me just save this file now
07:27 - and try reloading this page once again
07:29 - on the browser so as you can see now a
07:31 - small circle is being displayed instead
07:33 - of the numbers over here which is the
07:35 - unordered list that we have defined
07:38 - inside the nested order list so Guys
07:40 - these are certain ways in order to
07:42 - display the ordered list and the nested
07:44 - ordered list as well comment in the
