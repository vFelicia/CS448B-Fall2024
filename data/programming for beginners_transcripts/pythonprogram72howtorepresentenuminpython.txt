00:00 - welcome to another video in which we are
00:02 - going to write Python program to
00:03 - represent enum so guys we can easily
00:06 - represent enum in Python using the enum
00:09 - module and the class as well so let us
00:11 - move to the vs code over here the very
00:13 - first thing that we will be doing is
00:15 - from the enum module we will be
00:17 - importing the enum class so we import
00:20 - enum over here so guys basically this is
00:22 - the way in order to import one
00:25 - particular class from a module so as you
00:27 - can see we use the from keyword followed
00:29 - by the name of the module that is enum
00:31 - in this case and then we are importing
00:33 - just one class that is enum over here
00:35 - and then guys let's say we want to
00:37 - Define our own enum so we will say class
00:40 - over here and let's say we want to
00:42 - define the list of days so over here we
00:44 - will give the name of the class as day
00:46 - and then inside the open and close
00:48 - brackets we will provide this enum class
00:50 - over here and then guys after colon we
00:52 - need to define the name and value page
00:55 - over here so let's say we have the name
00:58 - as Monday which is one of the days in
01:00 - the week and the value that we give to
01:02 - this particular name that is Monday it
01:04 - is 1 over here and then guys we can have
01:06 - another name that is Tuesday which is
01:09 - another day of the week and the value
01:10 - that we gave is 2 in this case and then
01:13 - we have Wednesday over here and then the
01:15 - value that we gave is 3 and so on we can
01:18 - have the name value page over here in
01:20 - this case guys you can have any name
01:22 - where you pass based on your
01:23 - requirements over here but this is one
01:25 - of the ways in order to Define enums in
01:28 - Python now guys how do we access this so
01:30 - basically we can simply use the print
01:32 - statement over here so we say print and
01:35 - then in order to print one of the
01:36 - members of the enum we can simply use
01:39 - this day variable over here so we say
01:41 - day followed by Dot and then we have
01:44 - let's say if we want to print the member
01:46 - that is Monday over here so we will
01:48 - simply use Monday in this case so this
01:50 - is the expression that is the name of
01:51 - the class and then followed by Dot and
01:54 - then the name of the enum over here in
01:56 - order to print the inner member so guys
01:58 - let me just save this file now and try
01:59 - running this code so as you can see it
02:02 - says day dot Monday that is being
02:04 - printed over here now guys let us say we
02:06 - only want to print the left hand side
02:08 - that is the name of the enum over here
02:10 - so what we will be doing is again let's
02:12 - say we have another print statement and
02:14 - then we will say day followed by Dot and
02:17 - then Monday that is one of the names
02:19 - over here followed by Dot and then we
02:21 - have something called as name in this
02:23 - case so guys this is the attribute that
02:26 - can be used in order to print just the
02:28 - value of the name of the enum over here
02:31 - so let me just save this file now and
02:32 - try running this code once again so as
02:34 - you can see we are getting Monday that
02:36 - is a name of the enum which is Monday
02:38 - over here now let us say we want to find
02:40 - the value of that particular name that
02:42 - is Monday so what we can do is instead
02:45 - of having the name we can have the value
02:46 - so what we will do is over here only we
02:49 - will have comma and then we will have
02:51 - hyphen over here so on the same line we
02:54 - will give the value as well so we will
02:56 - use a day again followed by Dot and for
02:59 - the my Monday name we want to get the
03:01 - value so after Monday we specify dot
03:04 - followed by value in this case so guys
03:06 - basically this value will help us in
03:08 - order to get the right hand side value
03:10 - of this particular inner member so let
03:12 - me just save this file now and try
03:14 - running this code once again so as you
03:16 - can see we have got a Monday and then
03:17 - followed by hyphen and then one that is
03:20 - the value of this enum which is having
03:22 - the name value pairs as Monday and 1
03:25 - respectively so same way we can get the
03:27 - name value page of Wednesday as well so
03:29 - over here instead of Monday we can
03:31 - simply provide Wednesday over here I'll
03:33 - simply copy and paste this for the value
03:35 - as well so let me just save this file
03:36 - now and try running this code once again
03:38 - so as you can see we have got the name
03:40 - as Wednesday and the value is 3 this
03:42 - time so guys this is the way that we can
03:44 - represent e num in Python programming
03:46 - language please make sure that you
03:48 - practice on your own so that on
03:49 - different inputs you get different
03:51 - outputs make sure that you like this
03:52 - video so that it reaches to more people
03:54 - and subscribe to the channel so that you
03:56 - get the notifications on upcoming videos
03:58 - as well the next video you that we are
04:00 - going to talk about is Python program to
04:02 - return multiple values from a function
04:05 - so stay tuned
