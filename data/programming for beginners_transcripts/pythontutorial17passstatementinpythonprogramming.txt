00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about pass statement in Python
00:05 - Programming so guys in Python
00:07 - Programming the pass statement is a null
00:09 - statement which can be used as a
00:11 - placeholder for future code so basically
00:14 - let's say you have a certain function or
00:16 - you have something else like you can
00:18 - have a while loop or the if condition as
00:20 - well and you want to implement the logic
00:22 - inside this Loop or the if condition
00:24 - later on in the future so you can use
00:27 - the pass statement in this case so as
00:29 - you can see suppose we have a loop or a
00:31 - function that is not implemented yet but
00:33 - we want to implement it in the future in
00:36 - such cases we can use the pass statement
00:38 - but now you will ask me we can also put
00:40 - the command inside this block that is
00:42 - inside the for Loop or the if condition
00:45 - as well so why do we use the pass
00:46 - statement so guys let us understand this
00:49 - with the help of example so first of all
00:50 - we will understand the past statement
00:52 - over here so let's say we have the eyes
00:54 - value as 1 over here and then we have
00:57 - the if condition so inside the if
00:59 - condition what we are doing is we are
01:01 - just checking whether I is less than or
01:04 - equal to 10 and then we have a colon and
01:07 - let's say we have the print statement
01:08 - over here and then we say yes less than
01:12 - 10 so we put yes less than 10 over here
01:15 - and then what we will do is we will have
01:17 - another print statement and I will say
01:20 - outside if
01:22 - statement
01:24 - so guys this is a very simple code first
01:26 - of all we have initialized the variable
01:28 - I to the value equal to 1 and then we
01:31 - have the if condition I is less than or
01:34 - equal to 10 and we are Simply Having the
01:36 - print statement over here and then after
01:38 - this if condition we have printed that
01:40 - we have come outside the if Loop let me
01:42 - just save this file and try running this
01:44 - code now so it says yes less than 10 and
01:47 - it also says yes outside the if
01:49 - statement now let's say I have some plan
01:52 - in order to implement some logic over
01:54 - here but I don't have the exact logic
01:57 - right now so something else will be
01:58 - replacing this line of code over here so
02:01 - let's say I simply put a command and say
02:03 - that to the implemented in future so we
02:09 - have the statement over here that is to
02:10 - be implemented in future now remember
02:12 - guys this is a command that using the
02:15 - hash character over here we are putting
02:17 - the comment inside the if statement so
02:19 - let me just save this file and try
02:21 - running this code before running this
02:22 - code you can already see that with this
02:25 - print function we are getting the red
02:26 - underline but still we will go and run
02:28 - this code now so as you can see Line 6
02:30 - print outside if statement so expected
02:34 - and intended block after if statement on
02:37 - line three so basically the root cause
02:39 - is over here that is inside the if
02:40 - condition so what it is saying is inside
02:43 - the if condition we have not provided
02:45 - any block of code that is there is no
02:48 - logic inside the if condition that we
02:50 - have provided previously we had simply
02:52 - provided the print function which works
02:54 - already but this thing is not working so
02:57 - what we can simply do is instead of
02:59 - providing the comment we can simply
03:01 - provide the pass statement so guys what
03:03 - happens with the pass statement is The
03:05 - Interpreter understands that there is no
03:08 - block of code right now inside the if
03:10 - condition and it needs to be ignored for
03:12 - now as far as execution of the code is
03:15 - concerned but with the command the code
03:17 - doesn't understand such comment and
03:19 - basically it throws the error and that
03:21 - is what we have got previously so let me
03:23 - just save this file now and try running
03:24 - this code hopefully we should not get
03:26 - this error now so I'm just running this
03:28 - code once again so as you can see
03:30 - outside if statement is getting executed
03:33 - and basically this pass statement has
03:35 - helped us in order to make the control
03:38 - flow understand that there is no logic
03:40 - that is being implemented inside this if
03:42 - condition for now but in the future we
03:44 - will be implementing such a logic and
03:46 - for now you can just ignore it and pass
03:49 - to the upcoming lines of code over here
03:51 - so guys this is the main functionality
03:52 - of the past statement you can use it
03:54 - whenever you have the requirement of
03:56 - implementing some logic in the future
03:57 - inside the if condition or the for Loop
04:00 - or while loop or even in the defined
04:03 - functions as well which we are going to
04:04 - see in the upcoming videos so guys
04:06 - that's it in this video please make sure
04:08 - that you like this video so that it
04:09 - reaches to more people and subscribe to
04:11 - the channel so that you get the
04:13 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
04:15 - the next video that we are going to talk
04:16 - about is functions in Python Programming
04:19 - so stay tuned
