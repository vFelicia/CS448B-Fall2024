00:00 - so now we will see how to center the
00:02 - HTML element inside the diff tag in CSS
00:05 - so guys basically one of the problems of
00:08 - centering the HTML elements inside the
00:10 - div elements can be solved by using the
00:12 - flexbox layout and we are going to check
00:15 - with the help of example as well so let
00:17 - us move to the vs code over here and
00:19 - simply I'm going to remove the previous
00:20 - lines of code that we had return in the
00:22 - HTML and the CSS files so guys over here
00:25 - first of all we are going to define the
00:27 - diff tag with the class container in
00:29 - this case and then inside this we are
00:31 - going to have a simple diff tag that
00:33 - will say this is a simple diff tag so
00:37 - guys we have a very simple statement
00:39 - over here inside the container class let
00:41 - me just save this file now and try
00:43 - reloading this page on the browser so as
00:45 - you can see this is a simple diff tag is
00:47 - getting displayed over here now guys let
00:49 - us have certain background color for the
00:51 - container class and also the diff tag
00:54 - that is the child tag over here so we
00:56 - are going to copy this class name and
00:58 - then inside the st. CSS file we are
01:01 - going to provide the background color
01:03 - over here so let's say we have the
01:05 - yellow color is the background color
01:06 - apart from this we will also provide the
01:08 - padding of let's say 20 pixels in this
01:11 - case and then guys for the child tag
01:13 - over here inside the container class we
01:15 - are going to define the diff tag in this
01:18 - case and then we will say the background
01:20 - color of let's say aqua color over here
01:22 - and again we are going to provide the
01:24 - padding of let's say 10 pixels over here
01:27 - let me just save this file now and try
01:29 - reloading this page once again on the
01:30 - browser so as you can see the container
01:32 - tag that is having the yellow background
01:35 - color is going from left to right and it
01:37 - is taking the entire width of the screen
01:39 - over here apart from this the child tag
01:41 - that is having the aqua background color
01:44 - is also going from left to right and it
01:46 - is taking the entire width of the screen
01:48 - now guys what we will do is we will
01:50 - reduce the width of this child tag over
01:52 - here and we will set it only up to this
01:55 - required width that is required by the
01:57 - content of this D tag so ins this diff
02:00 - tag that is the child tag over here
02:02 - simply we are going to provide the
02:04 - display property and we will say inline
02:06 - block as the value so let me just save
02:08 - this file now and try reloading this
02:10 - page once again on the browser as you
02:12 - can see only the required width is now
02:14 - being taken by this particular diff tag
02:16 - that's because the default value of the
02:18 - diff tag as far as display CSS property
02:21 - is the block value so when we say block
02:23 - which means it is going to take the
02:25 - entire width that is from left to right
02:27 - over here but we are limiting that width
02:30 - by using the inline block value for the
02:32 - display property now guys what is the
02:33 - scenario over here is we want to Center
02:36 - align this particular diff tag as far as
02:39 - the container is concerned so we need to
02:41 - get this child diff tag at the center of
02:43 - the container let us have another
02:45 - situation over here we will also have
02:47 - the height of this container so let's
02:49 - say we provide the height as 300 pixels
02:52 - let me just save this file now and try
02:53 - reloading this page so as you can see we
02:55 - have the height of the container is 300
02:58 - pixels over here so how do we get this
03:00 - particular diff tag at the center of the
03:02 - container somewhere over here so let us
03:04 - try that so what we will do is first of
03:06 - all let us provide the text align CSS
03:09 - property we will check out different
03:11 - scenarios how we can achieve our task of
03:14 - getting the child diff tag at the center
03:16 - of the container so when we say text
03:18 - align equal to Center let me just save
03:20 - this file now and try reloading this
03:21 - page once again on the browser as you
03:23 - can see now this diff tag is present at
03:26 - the center as far as the horizontal
03:28 - alignment is concerned but how do we get
03:30 - it at the center as far as the vertical
03:33 - alignment is concerned another CSS
03:35 - property that we can use is using the
03:37 - line height over here and we can set the
03:39 - value equal to the height of the
03:41 - container that we have set over here so
03:43 - simply we will set the value as 300
03:45 - pixels so that the line height of the
03:48 - container is exactly the same as the
03:50 - height of the container over here so let
03:52 - me just save this file now and try
03:54 - reloading this page once again on the
03:55 - browser so as you can see we have
03:57 - provided the line height of 300 pixel
04:00 - the text is also coming at the center of
04:02 - the container now but we can see that
04:04 - there is a background color that is
04:05 - running from the top to the bottom of
04:08 - the container which is not required in
04:10 - this case so guys this is a limitation
04:12 - of using the line height over here along
04:14 - with it we have also used the text align
04:16 - CSS property so we don't want it in this
04:19 - way so let me just comment out these two
04:21 - lines of code over here so now we are
04:23 - back to our original position that is
04:25 - top left over here so guys we can simply
04:27 - use the flex boox layout in order order
04:29 - to Center align the diff tag over here
04:32 - so let us try that so for the container
04:34 - class what we are going to do is simply
04:36 - we will set the display property as Flex
04:39 - over here now guys since we have set the
04:41 - display property as Flex all the child
04:43 - items inside the container will be the
04:46 - flex items now and they will be running
04:48 - from left to right by default because
04:50 - the flex direction is row by default for
04:54 - any of the flex container so let me just
04:56 - save this file now and try reloading
04:58 - this page once again on the browser so
05:00 - as you can see the background color is
05:02 - now going from top to bottom over here
05:04 - in this case let us provide another CSS
05:06 - property that is justify content for
05:08 - this Flex container which will Define
05:10 - the horizontal alignment as far as Flex
05:13 - items is concerned so guys we will set
05:15 - the value as Center because we want the
05:17 - flex item that is this particular diff
05:20 - tag at the center as far as horizontal
05:22 - alignment is concerned so when we reload
05:24 - this page now as you can see the flex
05:27 - item is now at the center as far as the
05:29 - hor horizontal alignment is concerned
05:31 - now as far as vertical alignment is
05:33 - concerned we can use the Align content
05:35 - CSS property which will help us in order
05:38 - to align the flex items across the cross
05:41 - AIS over here so guys since the flex
05:43 - direction is row by default the justify
05:45 - content will help us in order to align
05:47 - the items on the main AIS which is going
05:50 - from left to right over here and the
05:52 - Align content will help us in order to
05:55 - align the items across the cross AIS
05:57 - which is going from top to bottom botom
05:59 - or the vertical AIS over here so we have
06:02 - just set the value as center for the
06:04 - Align content over here let me just save
06:06 - this file now and try reloading this
06:08 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:10 - can see there is no change right now
06:12 - that's because we have done a mistake
06:13 - instead of using the Align content it is
06:16 - align items that we must use so because
06:18 - basically align items will help us in
06:20 - order to align the flex items as far as
06:23 - the cross AIS is concerned in which case
06:25 - it is the vertical AIS over here so when
06:28 - we save this file now ENT reloading this
06:30 - page once again on the browser so as you
06:32 - can see now we have perfectly aligned
06:34 - the diff tag at the center of the
06:36 - container and this is the way that you
06:38 - can Center align the HTML element inside
06:40 - the container by using the flexbox
06:43 - layout over here so Guys these are the
06:45 - three important CSS properties that you
06:47 - must use that is display is equal to
06:49 - flex and then justify content is equal
06:51 - to Center and the Align items is equal
06:53 - to Center over here inside the flex
06:56 - container in this case so comment in the
