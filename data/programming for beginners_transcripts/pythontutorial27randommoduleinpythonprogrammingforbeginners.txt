00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to learn
00:03 - about random module in Python
00:06 - Programming so guys python offers the
00:08 - random module to Generate random numbers
00:10 - or to pick a random item from an
00:12 - iterator so we are going to check this
00:14 - with the help of examples now over here
00:16 - so first of all we are supposed to
00:18 - import the random module in this way and
00:21 - then as you can see we are printing a
00:23 - random range over here we are using the
00:25 - random module followed by the dot
00:27 - operator and then we are using the Rand
00:29 - range function in order to find the
00:31 - random range over here so let us move to
00:34 - the vs code over here in order to check
00:36 - the examples so first of all we will be
00:38 - importing the random module so we have
00:40 - import followed by random over here next
00:43 - let's say I want to print the random
00:45 - range so what we will do is we will have
00:47 - the print function and inside that we
00:50 - will be using the random module that we
00:52 - have just imported followed by Dot and
00:54 - as you can see vs code is suggesting us
00:56 - many other variables and the method
00:58 - names as well that we can use so we are
01:01 - going to say random range over here and
01:04 - the range it should be between 10 and
01:06 - 20. so we provide 10 comma 20 as the
01:09 - range so let me just save this file now
01:11 - and try running this code so as you can
01:13 - see we are getting 12 over here which is
01:15 - the part of this random range that is 10
01:17 - and 20. let's say we want the number to
01:20 - be between 100 and 200 over here so let
01:22 - me save this file and try running this
01:24 - code now after making changes as you can
01:26 - see we are getting the 178 similarly
01:29 - let's say if you want to throw the dice
01:30 - and only numbers that are present on the
01:32 - dices between one to six so you can use
01:35 - this random range function inside the
01:37 - random module and provide one comma 6 as
01:40 - the number in order to get the number so
01:42 - as you can see we are getting 4 over
01:44 - here next time when we run this and then
01:46 - we are getting 2 over here so you can
01:48 - use this function in order to develop
01:50 - your next game as far as throwing a dice
01:53 - is concerned now similarly we can also
01:55 - have the list as you can see we have the
01:57 - list one and then we have five
01:58 - characters over here let let's say out
02:00 - of these characters we want to select
02:02 - one of the characters so you can use the
02:05 - choice function inside the random module
02:07 - so let us check this with the help of
02:08 - example now over here so let's say we
02:10 - have the list of the programming
02:12 - languages so we name it as the list one
02:15 - as the variable name and then what are
02:17 - the programming languages so one is
02:19 - Python and then let's say we have Java
02:22 - as another programming language then
02:24 - let's say we have C plus plus and then
02:27 - let's say we have Swift as another
02:29 - programming language so these are
02:31 - certain programming languages now let's
02:32 - say out of all these four values we want
02:35 - to select one of the values randomly so
02:37 - what we can do is we can have the print
02:39 - function and then we can use this random
02:42 - module name followed by Dot and then we
02:44 - have the choice function name and inside
02:47 - this function we have to provide the
02:49 - list variable so we provide list one
02:52 - over here so basically we are passing
02:54 - this list one to this Choice function
02:56 - and asking the choice function to select
02:58 - one of the values from this list of
03:00 - values so let me just save this file and
03:02 - try running this code now so as you can
03:04 - see we are getting the Swift value as
03:06 - the random value if we run this code
03:08 - once again we will get some different
03:10 - value so as you can see we are getting
03:12 - Java this time then we run again we are
03:14 - getting python this time and then if we
03:16 - run again we are again getting Java so
03:18 - every time we will get a different value
03:20 - whenever we are using this particular
03:22 - function now let's say we want to print
03:23 - this list so what we will do is I'll
03:25 - just remove this part of the print
03:27 - statement and I'll simply provide a list
03:29 - one that is the variable name for that
03:31 - list let me just save this file and try
03:33 - running this code now so as you can see
03:35 - we are getting this list of values now
03:38 - before this what we can do is we are
03:40 - saying original list over here as the
03:42 - label so we say original list now
03:45 - exactly what we want to do is we want to
03:47 - shuffle this list let's say this
03:49 - sequence of data that we have inside the
03:51 - list we want to shuffle it so what we
03:53 - can do is simply we can use the random
03:56 - module name over here followed by Dot
03:58 - and it also has something called as
04:00 - Shuffle function so this will help us in
04:03 - order to shuffle all the values of this
04:05 - list that we provide so Shuffle followed
04:08 - by inside the open and close parenthesis
04:10 - we provide the list one variable name
04:12 - and then after that what we can do is we
04:15 - can simply print this list content once
04:18 - again and then we can simply put
04:20 - shuffled list over here instead of
04:22 - original list so before shuffling we are
04:24 - printing the original list over here
04:26 - which will print the values in this
04:27 - sequence and then after shuffling it
04:30 - will print the shuffled list over here
04:32 - where the values will be shuffled in
04:33 - this case so let me just save this file
04:35 - and try running this code now as you can
04:37 - see original list we are getting python
04:39 - Java C plus plus and Swift and then
04:41 - shuffle list it is Java Swift C plus
04:44 - plus and then python so we have just
04:46 - shuffled the list the values were
04:48 - completely shuffled inside the list and
04:50 - were printed on the screen now guys
04:51 - let's say very randomly you want to
04:54 - generate some kind of a element so what
04:56 - you can do is simply have the print
04:57 - statement over here and simply use the
04:59 - the random module in this case so I'll
05:02 - just remove this part of this line and
05:05 - then we can have the random followed by
05:07 - dot we have something called as random
05:09 - function over here this line of code
05:12 - will generate any element over here so
05:13 - let me just save this file and try
05:15 - running this code so as you can see we
05:17 - are getting a float number
05:19 - 0.1004 and so on and then let me just
05:22 - run this code once again as you can see
05:24 - we are getting another number over here
05:25 - and then let me just run this code 0.99
05:29 - so this line of code is helping us in
05:31 - order to generate the random numbers
05:33 - over here in this case so guys this is
05:35 - the way that you can use a random module
05:37 - over here in this case in order to
05:39 - randomly generate some numbers or
05:41 - randomly Shuffle the values inside the
05:43 - list that is present please make sure
