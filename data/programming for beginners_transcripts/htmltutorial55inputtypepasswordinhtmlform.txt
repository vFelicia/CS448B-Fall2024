00:00 - so now we will see input type password
00:02 - in HTML form so guys basically we can
00:05 - have the input tag and we can set the
00:08 - value of the type attribute over here as
00:10 - password so that whatever content you
00:13 - type inside this particular input field
00:16 - will not be displayed on the UI and the
00:18 - main use case over here is when you are
00:20 - logging in into a particular website you
00:23 - are providing your username and when you
00:25 - type the password you don't want someone
00:27 - else to see while you're typing it on
00:30 - the screen and that is where we use the
00:32 - input type password over here which
00:35 - defines the password field in this case
00:37 - so guys let us check this with the help
00:39 - of examples in VSS code over here so
00:41 - previously we had checked the input type
00:44 - that is text which allows us to provide
00:46 - certain kind of input with the help of a
00:48 - text field and this is how we can see
00:51 - the text field over here so guys what we
00:53 - will do is we will make some changes in
00:55 - this case so we will remove the second
00:57 - input field over here we will keep the
00:59 - first first label as username in this
01:02 - case so we will change the label to
01:04 - username over here and the input type
01:06 - will be text and we will set the name as
01:09 - username which will be used by the
01:11 - server in order to refer to the value
01:14 - provided into this text field and the ID
01:16 - that we provide over here will be
01:18 - username in this case and as I've told
01:20 - you the ID of this input must be set as
01:23 - the value for the for attribute over
01:25 - here for the label so that when the user
01:28 - clicks on this username label the cursor
01:31 - for this text field will be activated so
01:33 - we change this to username in this case
01:36 - let me just save this file now and try
01:38 - reloading this page on the browser so as
01:40 - you can see we have a simple text field
01:42 - over here with a username label and when
01:45 - the user clicks on this username this
01:47 - particular text field will get activated
01:49 - and we can simply provide the username
01:51 - for the login purpose now guys what we
01:53 - will do is we will have another field
01:55 - over here which will be the password
01:57 - field but we want that field to be of
02:00 - the type password so that whatever we
02:02 - type inside that particular text field
02:05 - will not be displayed over here since
02:07 - password should be secret so what we
02:09 - will do is I will simply copy and paste
02:11 - these lines of code over here that is
02:13 - label and input and for this input that
02:16 - is the second input over here we will
02:18 - change the type to password in this case
02:21 - so as you can see the type is equal to
02:23 - password and the name we will change it
02:25 - to password over here and then the ID as
02:28 - well we will change it to password in
02:30 - this case now guys this particular ID
02:32 - should be linked to this label so I'll
02:34 - copy this ID and paste it inside the for
02:38 - attribute over here and the label should
02:40 - be password in this case so we have
02:43 - changed the label as well let me just
02:45 - save this file now and try reloading
02:47 - this page once again on the browser so
02:49 - as you can see we have got the password
02:51 - text field as well now guys because we
02:53 - have set the type as password over here
02:56 - whatever we type inside this password
02:58 - text field will not be displayed to the
03:01 - user so when we start typing over here
03:04 - inside this text field so over here we
03:06 - are not able to see the characters that
03:08 - I am typing right now but the same thing
03:10 - when we type over here in the username
03:12 - you can see that we can type anything
03:14 - that we want and we can see it inside
03:16 - the text field over here so guys this is
03:18 - the main functionality of the input type
03:20 - password over here it doesn't allow
03:22 - anyone else to see what exactly you are
03:24 - typing inside that text box now guys
03:27 - when we are working of sending of this
03:29 - data that is username and password it is
03:31 - recommended that we use the post request
03:33 - over here so for example let's say we
03:36 - have another input that is the submit
03:38 - button over here so we will say input
03:40 - type submit and then the value that we
03:42 - provide is submit in this case let me
03:44 - just save this file now and try
03:46 - reloading this page as you can see we
03:48 - have provided submit button in this case
03:50 - so guys when we click on this submit
03:51 - Button as you can see user name is equal
03:54 - to so some data will be sent over here
03:57 - that's because by default the method for
04:00 - this form tag is get request so we have
04:03 - another attribute over here that is
04:05 - method for which there are two values
04:07 - that we can use the get request which is
04:09 - by default the value that is set for
04:11 - this method attribute and that is what
04:13 - we are using right now over here and the
04:16 - post request which will help us in order
04:18 - to hide this data so by default the get
04:21 - request is being called over here so
04:23 - what exactly is happening I'll show you
04:25 - once again over here we will reload this
04:27 - page and let's say for username we
04:28 - provide use username over here and for
04:31 - password we provide simple password in
04:33 - this case but guys when we click on
04:35 - submit over here as you can see the
04:37 - username is equal to username that was
04:39 - provided and password is equal to you
04:42 - can see that what I have typed over here
04:44 - is being displayed inside the URL so we
04:47 - should avoid this whenever we are
04:49 - dealing with submission of the form and
04:51 - that form contains some sensitive data
04:54 - so how we can avoid it is by using the
04:56 - post request over here so when we
04:58 - provide the post method and the request
05:01 - goes to the particular file that we
05:03 - defined in the action attribute in such
05:06 - case the username and password data will
05:08 - be sent as part of the HTTP request so
05:11 - guys it won't be displayed inside the
05:13 - URL over here so let me just save this
05:15 - file once again and try reloading this
05:18 - page on the browser so now if we provide
05:20 - the username in this case and then let's
05:23 - say I provide some password over here
05:25 - and click on submit as you can see the
05:27 - URL is not displaying the user username
05:29 - and password over here but it will be
05:31 - passed to the server as the HTTP request
05:34 - so in such cases when the passwords
05:36 - needs to be validated or if there is any
05:39 - sensitive data that is supposed to be
05:41 - sent on the server site we must use the
05:43 - post request over here by mentioning it
05:46 - to the method attribute of the form tag
05:49 - so that our sensitive data is protected
05:51 - from any other viewer who is trying to
05:53 - submit the form so guys this is the way
05:55 - that we can create the password text
05:57 - field using the HTML form for comment in
06:00 - the comment section below whether you
