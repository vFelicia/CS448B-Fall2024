00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome to another
00:02 - video in which we are going to write
00:03 - Python program to print the Fibonacci
00:06 - sequence using the for Loop now guys a
00:08 - Fibonacci sequence is the integer
00:10 - sequence as you can see it starts from 0
00:13 - that is the first integer and then the
00:15 - second integer that is the second term
00:17 - it is one and then the next term it will
00:19 - be the sum of the previous two numbers
00:21 - that is 0 plus 1 it is equal to one so
00:24 - this is the third term now and then the
00:26 - next term that is 2 it is equal to one
00:28 - plus one which is the sum of previous
00:30 - two numbers and guys so on all the
00:32 - integers will be generated so over here
00:35 - 8 is the sum of the previous two numbers
00:37 - that is three and five so guys always
00:39 - remember that the first two numbers it
00:41 - will be 0 and 1 which are the first two
00:44 - terms in the Fibonacci sequence so as
00:46 - you can see the first two terms are zero
00:48 - and one all the other terms are obtained
00:51 - by adding the preceding two terms so
00:53 - this means to say that the end the term
00:56 - is the sum of N minus 1 and the N minus
00:59 - 2 times arm over here so guys let us
01:01 - check the Python program in order to
01:03 - implement this Fibonacci series and what
01:06 - we will be doing is we will be asking
01:08 - the user to enter the number of terms
01:10 - that is required inside the Fibonacci
01:12 - sequence and we will be generating those
01:14 - number of terms using the python code so
01:17 - guys over here we will say n terms so
01:19 - this is the variable name that we are
01:21 - going to give which will be entered by
01:23 - the user so we provide input function
01:25 - and then we say enter the number of
01:29 - terms in Fibonacci
01:33 - series
01:35 - so here the user will be providing the
01:38 - number of terms that is required in the
01:39 - Fibonacci series that he wants to see
01:42 - now before this input we will be
01:44 - providing the end function so that the
01:46 - input that is provided by the user which
01:48 - is of the string data type is converted
01:50 - to the integer and then it is stored in
01:52 - the N terms now guys what we will be
01:54 - doing is we will have the three
01:55 - variables over here and one and then we
01:58 - have N2 and then another one will be N3
02:01 - so over here for now the N1 and N2
02:03 - values will be 0 and 1 and then we have
02:06 - the third term that is N3 which will be
02:08 - found by using the sum of the previous
02:10 - two numbers so for now we will keep it
02:13 - as 0 since we will be finding it inside
02:15 - the for Loop now guys what we have to do
02:17 - is we have to use the for Loop and then
02:19 - we have to go through all the terms in
02:22 - such a way that we have to find the
02:23 - Fibonacci series with this many terms
02:26 - that is the n terms which is provided by
02:28 - the user so guys inside the for Loop we
02:30 - have this I variable and then we will be
02:33 - using the in and then we have the range
02:35 - now guys this range it will go from 0 up
02:38 - to the number that is n terms so over
02:41 - here we provide the N terms now guys out
02:43 - of these n terms we already have the two
02:45 - terms that is N1 and N2 which is already
02:48 - included as the part of this n terms so
02:51 - what we have to do is we have to exclude
02:52 - these numbers so we have to provide
02:54 - minus 2 this time since these two
02:56 - numbers are already included so we have
02:58 - n terms minus 2 and then after this we
03:01 - have the colon and then what we can do
03:03 - is we can compute the value that is 3.
03:06 - so before Computing what we have to do
03:08 - is we have to print those two numbers
03:09 - that is N1 and N2 so over here we will
03:12 - be providing the print statement and
03:14 - then we can say Fibonacci
03:17 - series and Then followed by colon and
03:20 - then what we can do is we have 0 and
03:23 - then we have 1 over here and then after
03:25 - this we have to provide the dot format
03:27 - function and then we can simply provide
03:29 - N1 comma N2 so guys this will help us in
03:32 - order to print the first two terms that
03:34 - is N1 and N2 now guys for this what we
03:37 - have to do is the next print statement
03:39 - should not go on the next line so we
03:41 - will provide the end parameter over here
03:43 - so for this end parameter we will
03:46 - provide space over here and remove the
03:48 - last space from here now guys in order
03:50 - to generate the N3 number what we have
03:52 - to do is it will be the sum of the
03:53 - previous two numbers that is N1 and N2
03:56 - so over here we will come back again N3
03:58 - it is equal to N1 plus N2 which means 0
04:03 - plus 1 that is 1 which will be stored in
04:05 - this N3 now guys we can simply print
04:07 - this N3 over here which will be the
04:09 - continuation after this print statement
04:11 - that is 0 and 1 so over here we will
04:14 - provide the print statement and then
04:16 - inside this we you provide the number
04:18 - that is N3 and Then followed by comma
04:20 - and then space again so over here
04:22 - followed by Dot and then we provide the
04:25 - format again and then we say N3 so guys
04:28 - this is the way that we can provide the
04:30 - N3 as the variable by using these curly
04:33 - braces and using the dot format function
04:35 - over here now guys The Next Step will be
04:37 - after providing this entry we have to
04:39 - set the N1 and N2 numbers as the
04:42 - preceding two numbers so now the N2
04:45 - value should be provided to the N1
04:47 - variable so over here N1 it is equal to
04:50 - N2 and then the value of N3 should be
04:53 - provided to the N2 so this will help us
04:55 - in order to set the previous two numbers
04:57 - so that we can find the next N3 term
05:00 - over here so basically we have the next
05:02 - expression as N2 it is equal to N3 so
05:05 - guys N2 value is now stored in N1 and N3
05:08 - value is now stored in N2 so next time
05:10 - when the control flow comes back over
05:12 - here N1 plus N2 will be stored in the N3
05:15 - and we will get the new entry value and
05:18 - again it will be printed over here by
05:19 - using this print statement so guys this
05:21 - is the way that we can find the entire
05:23 - Fibonacci series for the number of terms
05:25 - that is entered by the user now guys let
05:28 - me just save this file now and try
05:29 - running this code let us check for the
05:31 - very first time the five terms inside
05:33 - the Fibonacci series which will start
05:35 - from zero so when we enter the number 5
05:37 - over here and then when we press enter
05:39 - as you can see Fibonacci series it is 0
05:42 - 1 1 and then we have two and then we
05:44 - have three now guys the other terms that
05:46 - is 2 and 3 have come on the next line
05:48 - that's because we have not provided the
05:50 - end parameter over here so what we will
05:52 - be doing is we will remove the space
05:54 - character after this comma and over here
05:57 - we will provide the end parameter so
05:59 - after this comma we provide the end
06:01 - parameter for this print statement and
06:03 - we provide the space character as the
06:05 - end parameter now this will help us to
06:07 - not go on the next line after this print
06:10 - statement is executed now let me just
06:12 - save this file now and try running this
06:14 - code once again this time we will see
06:16 - for the seven number of terms inside the
06:18 - Fibonacci series so when we press 7 when
06:21 - we press enter over here as you can see
06:23 - we have got the seven terms so 0 1 1 and
06:26 - then we have 2 which is the sum of 1
06:28 - plus 1 which is two and then two plus
06:30 - one we have three three plus two we have
06:32 - five five plus three is eight over here
06:34 - and that is how we have got these seven
06:36 - terms of the Fibonacci series now guys
06:39 - let us run this code once again this
06:40 - time we want 12 terms over here so when
06:43 - we press enter after this 8 which was
06:46 - the seventh term over here we have the
06:48 - eighth nine ten eleven and then 12 terms
06:51 - so 8 plus 5 is 13 13 plus 8 is 21 then
06:55 - 21 plus 13 is 34 34 plus 21 is 55 and 55
07:00 - plus 34 which is 89 and this is the last
07:03 - term in the Fibonacci series as far as
07:06 - 12 number of terms in the series are
07:08 - concerned so guys this is the very
07:10 - simple way in order to find the
07:12 - Fibonacci series so guys please make
07:13 - sure that you practice on your own so
07:15 - that on different inputs you get
07:16 - different outputs make sure that you
07:18 - like this video so that it reaches to
07:20 - more people and subscribe to this
07:21 - channel so that you get the
07:22 - notifications on upcoming videos as well
07:25 - the next video that we are going to talk
07:26 - about is Python program to print the
07:28 - Fibonacci sequence but using the
07:30 - recursion so over here currently we have
07:33 - used the for Loop but in the next
07:35 - program we will be using the recursive
07:37 - function in order to find the Fibonacci
07:39 - sequence so stay tuned
