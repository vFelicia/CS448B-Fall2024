hello everybody my name is Jimmy and today I will be showing you how to make this game in construct 2. uh this is the game we're gonna be making today I took inspiration from Google drawings uh this this one not Google drawings Google was it Google Doodles yeah it's like a basketball game where you have to like hold a basketball and then shoot it um obviously like like this and then there's a timer there's a score and then when the time runs out it uh you can't shoot anymore also it gets progressively harder so yeah that's the game type we're gonna be making today um yeah let's go ahead and make it right so this is what it looks like in construct 2. very different I know but hey it's still kind of the same game so here's our starting page it's of course complete for free you don't need to download anything no need for like fancy like you know gadgets completely for free so all these problems I decided myself uh you don't have to design them you could I have a link for you to download all the props I'm using in this video so I have this link attached in the description if you want to go download that just download it and unzip it so yeah this is what the game we're gonna be making so there's a guy here he shoots a basketball like in Google kind of except the animation's a bit not nicer and once it hits five now it starts to move and now it randomizes its speed so if you go up or down as you can see it's a lot harder to get points Bam Bam come on go in go in oh oh nice bro nice not nice not nice nice 2017 17. oh dang it so there you go once it runs out the timer it will say you scored how many points and it has a redo button right here you press redo it just starts over again like so uh yeah that's basically it for our game it's really simple and it shouldn't take more than like an hour so yeah let's go ahead and make it so first things first we will need construct two if you guys don't have construct 2 just go to construct to search it up like this click on the first link which is download construct 2. and then just go download the latest version uh I don't know what version I'm using but they should all be the same technically you could also use construct 3 but I'm not sure if it'll work so yeah just download construct 2 and then run it all right once you have construct 2 we're going to open it like so and we should be greeted with this page uh with the start page and little you know Monster and pig pig catapult uh what we want to do now is we want to press file new and then scroll down a little bit until we find new HD landscape 720p this one uh we're gonna press open because this is the resolution we want as you can see the window size is 720p we're going to copy the window size which is this guy right here the borders and we're gonna paste it into our layout size bam so now we don't we got rid of the borders the border is basically like how what the players can see while playing the game so if you get rid of the borders they can see the entire screen which is what we want but sometimes you know for uh role play games or uh first person shooter games they sometimes have to hide a lot of the screen in order to make the uh the the person move around to check what's on like the next page or something but ours is a stationary game so we don't need that uh so once you've done like this that we can exit out the start page and we're going to rename our project into basketball basketball all right and after that we're gonna press our layout rename this to game because we're going to do the game first and then we're gonna do our starting and end page I might even add a chop if we have extra time game e or our event sheet like so all right now once we have this we're going to press Ctrl s to save it I have mine in construct 2 right here so I'm just going to create a new folder called basketball basketball we're gonna double click press I'll have a folder called code to store our code rename this basketball version one and press enter to save all right once we save this we're gonna go download our props that we want so we're gonna go to our Link in the description download right here it's not a virus by the way I'll download it for you uh once you download it it should be bballprops.zip open that up and then go to downloads extract extract all extract and then you should have bball Prof you're going to control X go to our folder basketball we're going to paste that in right here so we have Bebop props and we have a rebuild version one and then here oh wait wait a minute what happened wait what oh did I zipped the wrong thing hold on oh it's right here it's right here okay we're good we're good guys I think I didn't save it correctly so it it didn't work or something I have no idea but basically when you download it it shouldn't be code probably I uploaded something wrong but it should be something like this right guys um so ignore that so once you download it you should extract it and you should see a player and hoop so the hoop is just uh the hoop we're gonna be using and the players is going to be the animations so this is the idol this is the the step one stage two stage three stage four uh so yeah this is what we're gonna be using all right we can minimize our page now get rid of this uh just minimize that all right so first off if you want a background you can go ahead and add one but I'm not I'm gonna add a floor first that's our first priority so instead of the floor we can't because it's like a function in construct two we're gonna give me ground instead ground and we're gonna grab our bucket and we're gonna flip a good color for like a basketball court like somewhere orangey right maybe a little like lighter orange like a quart like wood a color French wood like that uh maybe it's a bit too orange a little bit more lighter I think that looks good all right we're gonna just put it right like this uh it depends on how thick you want I think I will have like this much just drag it across the entire thing make sure to leave some Edge room because sometimes construct 2 has a gradient on the ends which doesn't look that good and you can shorten it up like this and there you go we have our ground that's our first Sprite uh now we're gonna add our player so insert Sprite name this player a player enter and now we're gonna just simply do load an image from file or actually a better option would be import frames from files like so go to our construct 2 or basketball basketball props player highlight all of them and press open then we have all of our images right let's delete zero all right so once we have this we're going to rename this just to no let me just leave like that all right we're gonna click on our origin point this is very important so pay attention press your origin point and set it on the head like somewhere where it's like stationary I left for my last one I said on the head right here because the head never moves uh wait what oh did it crop it it did crop it oh no uh well we have to find someone that doesn't move I guess maybe just maybe let's just put it on the head I'll I'll take care of the first one uh C Bam Bam wait the head starts to move what two three four face on the head place on the head okay uh the first one a bit worried though because the center of origin is different from the rest we could just use your hand to guide ourselves so all right we're gonna press number one we're gonna put our hand on the center of origin go back to this one and our hands right here so we're gonna boom like that so that's our Center origin we have to make sure they're on the same spot or else it won't look the same all right uh so once you have this we're gonna go set click on default speed to zero and then we should be okay let's exit that all right let's shrink it down uh we can just change to make sure it's okay one did it like change spots okay kind of did what if I just said on the head as if I'm doing it fresh so I'm a bit confused oh yeah this is correct send the head guys yeah we or Perfect all right we're good we're good now we're gonna set this somewhere like maybe around here all right so just sit on the head that's it set it on the head uh once you're done sending everything on the head we're gonna press add on image points right here we're gonna add image point one and we're going to put it on the ball so when it released uh when it like shoots the basketball the basketball is going to come from the actual basketball not like somewhere else so we're gonna put it right here and try to make try to do your best to put in the center but it's if it's not perfect that's fine do this for every single frame so next frame press add press place add Place add Place perfect uh you can take your time you can pause the video if you are if I'm going too fast or something but anyways once you're done with that close it out and now I have our player uh now the other thing we need is our hoop let me just increase the player size a little bit yeah it looks that's fine I think it's like this all right again you can make your own if you want uh this is I know it looks bad but yeah that's mine so we're gonna add another hoop now add Sprite oop Place load an image go to pop props grab hoop I did not mean to set the center of origin like that Holy I'm sorry okay hold on we can reset uh quick assign the middle all right this one's the center of origin is not important but I just want it to be the middle all right perfect and once you have this we're just going to place it somewhere like here make sure this on the side because when we go up and down it looks a lot natural I mean a lot more natural um so yeah I think I'll place it here that looks good and we're gonna also go into the said collagen polygon right here you can see it's very messy we're gonna grab this and we're gonna place it on the little edges by the way not the not this not the rim we're gonna play something else for that but we're just going to use this little backboard right here just place on the Blackboard our backboard all right the more detailed the better because we do have extra polygon Checkers so the more detail to better like so bam so we just need the backboard right here so it can bounce off into it all right perfect once you're done like this close it up and we're gonna apply Behavior our first Behavior we're going to add uh we're gonna put physics inside physics and there uh now how do we uh I think like a basketball board should be like you know somewhat like not that elastic so we're gonna change our elasticity to 0.1 because it still bounces off the backboard but it's like not the most like elastic thing in the world so yeah I think 0.1 is pretty good uh immovable make sure to uh say yes because if it's not watch watch every time movable this is gonna happen we and it falls down right we have to make it immovable so yes all right once you're done like this let's make sure it's okay uh perfect uh and maybe increase this a little bit increase this a little bit all right that should be good and once you have this we're going to add we're gonna click save as actually file save as single file basketball V2 like so make sure to save inversions because if there's something went wrong you could go back and do it again go back to like a different version uh so we're gonna insert another object this one's gonna be our score boom uh I'm gonna set it as impact because I feel like impact is the most like game font so impact I'm gonna set it at 48 uh enter we're gonna have a score and time in the same one so we're gonna just type it out and score they got 10 slash oh but that's I have like a was it an rk50 something 61 so it's I have to switch between the control and the slash key it's kind of confusing but yeah so score 10 timer uh let's say 30. all right we're gonna increase to make it make sure it looks nice all right the reason we're doing this is to see where the position is so it looks the best uh I think it looks good here yeah it looks good all right so once you have all our mechanics or game things done we're gonna add in a particle this is just fancy little effects you know when like when we go through the basket there's gonna be a little splash or particle animation uh we're gonna Press On brush this really depends if you want a square or like a circle you could have any shape really um I think I'll just draw a star for this one be a little bit more be a little bit more creative uh so let me grab a star one two three four five horrible star but you can't really notice in a particle so you don't have to make it perfect just uh noticeable I guess all right and now we're gonna pour in the the gaps like so I'm just got and we've got our star uh we can just copy it like this perfect all right so this is our particle right here we're gonna tilt it down like so so when it goes like goes like push this way and we're gonna set our spray coin to around 100 to make it spray a little wider uh one shot instead of continuous speed 200 I think it's fine size you're gonna set to 10 make a little smaller opacity Maybe 80. uh uh yeah I think that's fine and we're gonna set a whole bit of different layers well this is layer zero right let's rename this to game layer game layer all right so we're gonna name our layers now we're gonna name this a hoop layer as well because you know our hoop needs to always stay on top so we're gonna move this to who player let's move to layer hoop all right but now we're gonna lock hoop so we can go through the hoop all right so once we have like something like this uh we have our star we can test it out see how it looks yeah it's fine but I don't think it's perfect so I think we need our uh what is it called size to be a little bit bigger 20 maybe let's try 20. is it more noticeable I wanted I want them to notice a star if it says something like this it's fine just press ok uh it's it's a bit too packed now I guess it's maybe 15 so the speed to like 250. uh LD I'll decrease the acceleration or increase I guess and then boom let's check that uh uh let me see what if I move this up a little bit more bam oh that looks nice all right that's pretty good uh so yeah that should be okay and we're gonna set oops we're gonna on we're gonna unblock our hoop because I forgot we have to sail a bit more we're gonna set another we're gonna set an origin point for this as well image point because this is for the particle itself where it needs to come out of I think somewhere around here is pretty good so this is where the particle is gonna explode from right there that looks good let's do that out all right once we have this we're going to add another Behavior we're going to add sine this basically allows it to move up and down uh and we're gonna set it as inactive from the start yes no active and start no a movement we're gonna say it's vertical and yeah we should be able to lock it again there you go perfect uh once you have this we're going to grab this toss it out a little bit so they don't see it from the start all right uh what else do we need oh we need our we need our border so the rim right here to make these two like you know not able to go right through this part which is not like a basketball unlike real life you're gonna add Sprite we're gonna add a border like so this just invisible layer hoop is locked oh wait shoot I mean to spawn some game layer uh let me delete border all right make sure to press game layer okay because then this will spawn in game layer order like so and we're gonna pour in any color of your choice because nobody's gonna see it anyways I'm gonna plug and play with green and now we're gonna just make it a little bit thinner like so we're gonna tilt it a little bit like so we're gonna put it like here okay I think that looks nice just try to trace the edge of it all right we're gonna add a behavior we're gonna add this another physics all right physics movable yes elasticity it's a rim so it should bounce a little bit so I don't think I'm gonna change anything uh and we're gonna add another one sign so it'll move along with the hoop when it gets to move uh same thing here just set active from the start no horizontal vertical uh and we're just going to duplicate this control C control V bam just gonna put on this side as well like so tilt it a little bit and there perfect so that should be all good and now once we have our border oh wait I almost forgot we had to set it's invisible or else they will see it invisible invisible all right we have our border now we have to have our Checker the thing that checks if you know the ball went in the hoop or not so let's add that into new objects right we're gonna just Checker not like the game like the little Checker thingy any color I'm going to go over her yellow because that represents checking to me for some reason yellow paste that right here a little bit like that like so all right there that's our Checker um but make sure it goes the entire hoop because just in case like there's a robe ball it actually only went through this way like pretend you have like a square it might have gone through this uh Gap without you know us checking for it so to be safe just expand the entire thing all right once you have Checker we're gonna add in uh one Behavior we're gonna add in sign like so and again set everything to uh everything else so no vertical I mean not accurate to start vertical and yeah that's it right uh physically immobile yes okay and that's it uh so now to have everything in you know in place we're gonna start coding so we're gonna add in keyboard and touch uh these are the two things that use to control and interact with the game so once we have this we're gonna go into our game event add event uh we're gonna do unstarted layout on Startup layout like so we're going to reset our all our variables so we're going to add three variables here we're gonna add a timer really important we're going to add a time shoot so this is when the player shoots is going to time it and we're also going to add a score once you have this uh is there anything else we need I feel like there's one thing I'm missing I'm not sure though um oh I got it the speed of the board so we're at speed as well okay so we're gonna first add set value to score at zero because you know when they start you have to add zero uh we're gonna set timer to 30. because this is how much time you want you can add or decrease this time up to you uh we're gonna add we're gonna set time shoot times true to zero we're also going to uh set the speed to 5. so in construct 2 house speed is measured is kind of confusing so it's measured in Period uh basically what you do is the the longer your period it's basically I think how many seconds uh your thing needs to travel down and up so pretend that ours is going down and up like this right so up here would be like 10 a period of five seconds would be one two three four five but appeared once I can be like one like that so it's a little short of the period I mean the less the period the lot the faster it is hopefully that makes sense so that would be like the maximum the slowest we're going to uh we're gonna give so five is the slowest so we're gonna set us five you could sell this different again um but I'm just gonna put it as five because it seems like a good number all right once we've done this uh oh wait I almost forgot we need a basketball that's pretty important basketball like so and we're gonna place it here oh wait uh guys I'm sorry I forgot to put the basketball inside of the prop thingy but uh I'll I will put that there when you download it but for me right now I forgot to put that in there so I'm just gonna go grab it from my this file really quickly basketball please all right okay uh thank you uh see you again tomorrow uh we're gonna put this right in there boom we have our basketball okay uh I promise this will be in there when you get it um all right so let's delete our basketball really quickly delete all right and now we have our ball we're just gonna place it off to the side like right here make sure the sides are the same if they're not just change it a little bit because when you increase or decrease your player basketball might change so make sure they look around the same size I think that's pretty good all right so once we have our basketball and everything we're gonna set some behaviors to our basketball let me delete this first all right we're gonna set as uh physics so physics and we're just gonna leave immovable no yeah that's it right yeah okay that's it so we have our basketball we have everything now let's go code finally oh wait we still got one more thing we need our um what's it called we need our shooter where the player is going to aimp you shoot it's called the shoot object a bit confusing but basically when in construct 2 uh when the player shoots or like something sends music two or something it needs like an object to send it towards so we're gonna have this little blue box floating up and down like around this part of the goal and the players the the program is going to design when the player shoots to try to aim towards this blue box which will uh which will allow the ball to pass it and enter the goal if that makes sense but we're gonna basically have a little aimer thingy and we're gonna make it invisible so yeah it's kind of like lock base as well so makes it more fun uh let's grab our mint color paste that in there decrease this and this is gonna go up and down right here so when the ball shoots it's gonna try the best it's to aim towards this it pretends up here but we don't set enough power for it to go directly like this right we're gonna set like a little bit of power so it goes like this and maybe maybe it doesn't touch and maybe it goes in like this so yeah that's basically the uh what's this blue box used for and we're gonna name this to shoot object that's pretty good name a behavior to sign now this really depends on how difficult you want your game to be if you want it to be super difficult uh make sure it says vertical uh if you want it to be super typical difficult we're going to move it a lot but if you want it you know moderate we just move around this much so I think I'll have it like a random medium so also appear to two magnitude to maybe 35 all right let's see how it looks yeah this should be okay and then when the player shoots it goes like that you could change later if you want but I think we'll leave like that for now okay and now we're gonna set this as invisible so they don't see it bam perfect we should have everything we need now probably if if something you're missing I'll just go do it uh when the time comes all right so once we have everything in place we're now going to add uh we're gonna add probably every X seconds 10 of every one second we're going to subtract from our uh our timer by one so this way it's starting to count down and then once we do this we're gonna do add sub event compare variable if timer is less or equal to zero we're gonna have it restart layouts obviously we're gonna have it teleport us to the end uh after but I haven't created the layout the layer oh my God the layout yet so I'm just going to say go to layout game like so all right once we're done like this uh we should be okay uh for the timer and we're also going to add every X SEC every tick tick tick tick tick every tick we're gonna do s uh text set text there's no said text what there must be a set text right oh did I do it in here okay oh I didn't bro set text perfect uh we're gonna say score colon space and or like the and sign we're gonna do score like so uh and uh make sure to add quotations again slash this is to add the timer like so and timer it's basically like a con like uh contending a string in Python score and score and timer and timer except for this time you don't have to change every like every single variable the family root of the variable to match each other for example this is integer this is a string we don't have to change it we just put and I think you should learn um but anyways that's it press done uh we could just test it out so we can add system add to score by one in every ten every one second so it should go up every one second perfect so it goes down it goes up uh I need to add a space here so yeah let's go edit that so everything looks fine let me delete that really quickly I'm gonna add a little space here like so make it look a little bit more nicer for Aesthetics and that's it for our text uh once our we have our text done we're going to move on to our hard part which is to get the player to shoot so we're going to add event uh keyboard key is down you could choose any key I'm going to choose spacebar when space is down uh and we're gonna add a condition we're gonna add for every this is how much how fast you want the the frame to move for some people it might be like really fast which is going to make the game harder some people might make it slower which is gonna make the game easier but at the same time they'll not get as like if pretend they score 100 of the time right you're not gonna get as much points as somebody who like does it really really fast so it really depends but for me I'm gonna sit at 0.4 you can copy me or or uh you can test on your own I feel like 0.4 is a pretty good middle uh so once you have 0.4 we're going to say system add to time shoot by one and what time shoot does is it helps us calculate our uh our force and also sets the frame for us as well so it's pretty important uh once we add one to timeshare there's a bunch of things we have to do for example player we're gonna set frame to time shoot like so done so this way if we were to test this out now the player should be able to like there you go perfect but now it's gonna be stuck here right so it will follow time shoot so if you hold it temperature will go up 0.4 seconds it will add play the animation uh and let's make this invisible okay that's that's a pretty good thing let me lock hooplier first all right let me make this invisible bye bye uh now let's go into add action so once you have our animation done we now need two oh yeah do our four so pretend we let the spacebar go what do we do right so I want to set animation to time shoot and now let's go add event keyboard uh on key release no we're just gonna control C control V this and then from here we're gonna do something called inverting so we're gonna do we're delete this actually we can change this really quickly compare variable change every four seconds 0.4 seconds to compare variable time shoot is uh greater than one right one or zero greater than zero greater than zero space is down let's invert this space is not down but timesheet is greater than zero we're going to make it shoot right so we're going to make it shoot first or delete these two uh uh all right add action player uh no we're going to do system system create object this where it gets a little confusing ball X we want to set as player dot image point image point x and parentheses one like this all right when you're copying pastes for y but instead of X we're going to change it to Y like so and once you have this we should be okay to create the balls um if we were to play now how would happen is there's gonna be a trail of balls I'm pretty sure yeah exactly um because now it creates the ball but at the same time the ball has physics so it's going to create a bunch of them um and we're gonna have to reset timestream to do it one time as well we're gonna add action we're gonna set ball set force or Force apply Force towards a position horse is gonna be time shoot this is an algorithm that I made I'm not sure if it's the best algorithm but it it's it works a little bit um so we're gonna set Time Force time shoot which is our variable int and we're gonna do int random like so inch random from where to where so we're gonna set as 750 or let's do 700 700 to 850 like so and we're going to close out the parentheses there you go it should be perfect now uh let's press done okay I'm missing what am I missing oh I need another all right I need another parentheses um and now once we have our Force we're gonna do our X and our y so uh where we're going to aim it at this is what the shoot object comes into so again shoot object dot X copy paste shoot object dot y there you go and that's basically going to allow us to shoot at the object but I saw if I already play this now there's going to be a bunch of balls just streaming towards the shoot object so we're gonna have to cancel this condition out which means we're going to set our time Shoot To Zero there you go and we're gonna set our animation back to typescript so yeah this should be AOkay let's try it out bam there you go looks a lot nicer you can actually score some hoops now actually like so there you go all right and you can adjust the force depending on if it's too hard or too easy I think it's perfect so I'm going to leave it like this okay uh once you're done with this we're going to now add an event in order to add the score because our score is at zero and it doesn't really look that good so let's go system uh actually let's go uh where is it ball is overlapping another object we're gonna choose checker done add Action System add to score by one okay and we're also going to click right here click over here add add a condition we're gonna do trigger one so it doesn't add a score rapidly quicker once like so perfect uh once you have something like this we're going to test it out let's see if our score goes up okay that was pathetic throw there you go got a one two ah no or if they're harder harder boom there you go again it's a pretty fun game so yeah uh so we now actually got a working game so if you just want to leave like this you can this ball but let's I'm gonna take another level so once you have uh our scoring system we're gonna add uh we're gonna add our particles now my voice really hurts for some reason system create object create object we're going to create our particle and now this is where image Point comes into play so we're going to add our hoop Dot image point x one just like before copy oops copy everything paste it enrich it to y EP perfect and now we should be done like so uh so every time we do it there should be a little dust of Stars perfect that looks pretty nice you can even add sound effects if you want to but I'm a bit too lazy so I'm not oh no that's too far like so pretty good uh now when the ball Falls right it's actually not going to stop it's gonna like it goes in the hoop it's just gonna keep going down into the void into the abyss if we don't stop it so an easy way to stop that is to just say if ball outside of layout destroy but you'll see why I didn't do that in my previous program um because there's some reasons that you know it doesn't look good but we can also do it because it's a lot easier so add event ball if outside layout where is that let me feed him in position position as outside layout we're going to add ball destroy destroy all right so let's see how this works I'm just gonna shoot it really really really far uh yeah well it doesn't see that if it destroys or not but uh yeah basically that's it like so so it destroys the boss it doesn't keep going on for Infinity uh yeah that's it sometimes I do it the other way because it could have some potential bugs and errors if we're going to take this a step further but this is like basically the same thing so it doesn't really matter so yeah let's go back to our code all right now that we have our mechanics down uh what we need to do is we need our scoreboard to move right because that's a big part of our program so let's do add event system compare variable our uh score is greater or equal to five add Action System wait no no uh hoop set here set active like so as active all right perfect we're gonna duplicate this three times one two three and we're gonna replace our object or border and for Checker so this way after three times it's gonna move all in sync so it's gonna be all together I'm gonna add another action we're gonna set this as speed so set value no actually we're going to do a set value of speed to int random it will be int it because if we do random it could be a float which we don't want so we're gonna do int random uh let's say was it time speed no no we're going to do in random from one two five perfect press ok all right uh instead of doing this every time it says like this we're gonna do this every second so we're gonna place it up here every one second like so uh oh we actually gotta have another condition so we're gonna add system every one second every one second we're gonna grab this downward place it down here every one second we're gonna add a condition this condition basically says uh if our point is over so we're gonna say compare variable if score is greater than up to five like so ah there you go so this way it now works pretty well we're gonna place it on top of score now we're going to set our hoop and everything so that it goes up and down sign set period as speed so again one two three one two three oh that's a bit too much that's four we're gonna replace your object with border and then checker perfect and uh do we need anything else after this or is that it um let's see one two three uh yes okay come on come on let's get five let's get five again you can adjust the score so like you can if it's too easy you can make it like if a score is ten but it's pretty challenging for me oh no all right if the score is like 10 then move there you go it starts to move oh please no no right there perfect nice all right bam nope not slower as you can see now it's faster so it makes the player really confused but it looks really clean too ah and then resets the entire thing after 30 seconds so yeah that is our game as of now I think it's pretty polished pretty nice um all right so let's say this as version three make sure to save or else a crash sometimes to this as version three like so perfect uh once you have our game page done we're gonna design our ending page now so we're gonna add add layout add event sheet we're getting this uh end or let's say finish like so rename the event sheet to finish e for the event sheet finish event all right now once you have this we're just gonna again copy the window size paste and layout size all right perfect and what I like to do is just make everything look kind of the same so I'm going to grab the hoop grab this guy grab the floor all right we're gonna put into finish like so it doesn't matter where we put it first uh we're just gonna put it somewhere control see the hoop haste in here as well all right and now we're just gonna go grab the position from here to make everything look the same grab this position and go paste it in here oh wait what did I already put the position control C go finish bam what wait hold on I'm getting confused uh grab this position go to finish with no way they have the same position oh no they don't yeah there you go perfect we're gonna grab our player as well grab the position of the player go to finish equal V that was our hoop grab hoop grab the position go to finish paste it right there so now we should have an identical page as the game and instead of having a big like you know text right here we're gonna rename this first to make not get confused this is stats stats all right now we're going to insert a new object we're going to enter text uh we're gonna say congrats all right you got let's say 15 points 15 points or let's say score not got all right and we're going to change the font to again impact because why not impact is a great font whereas 48 is fine oh what does that mean assertion reference to memory the memory could not be written and it will crash watch there you go a crash but as I said earlier that's why we saved right uh let's let me close this really quickly all right so it crashed but luckily we were really you know good at saving everything so let's go over basketball again construct 2 basketball code and open our last one as if nothing ever happened we just have to design our uh end page again but yeah that's basically it nothing happened so let's rename our texting to stats okay sometimes when you edit the fonts and stuff it kind of glitches out and eventually we're going to name this again finish name this again as finish finish okay double click all right finish and now we're going to grab our window size layout size paste it in like so and we're going to do the same thing for all this so grab our player Ctrl C I'll control see this as well control C Ctrl V rechange the uh the the position and Bam bam bam oops Bam Bam Bam bam and we're gonna get our hoop so coffee hoop paste hoop and now we're gonna grab where the hoop is position and paste it right in perfect so once we have our uh this thing back again we're gonna quickly save it now so save as basketball version four before we edit our uh our text grab our text in we're gonna name this into score final and we're gonna set it to you scored 15 points I don't know why I like 15 too much but 15. all right we're going to set it to impact impact and we're going to set it to 48 okay it crashed again are you kidding me what happened the instructions at zero reference memory the memory could not be written oh it's a bit buggy but it's fine we have a version four just open it back up uh so it seems like maybe we can't do our our impact bot so let's just set this to score final and let's just set to a different font then you scored you scored 15 points and we're gonna set it to like uh let's say but font also looks nice in the game bit do we have like an 8bit font Maybe 8bit to have one I remember I had one didn't I Minecraft right yeah Minecraft this one uh let's set as 48. oh it's not supported or is it supported please say support it no it's not supported dang it uh Minecraft Tia not supported uh well let's find something else shall we uh let's press enter on my back um what looks nice oh wait this one's small fonts is it supported please say it's not it's not supported are you kidding me uh what looks nice that's the good in the game what if I just go with this classic aerial that's pretty boring me right Latin looks kind of like rip off impact I don't know why I can't do impact uh uh Min Matt's wench wheeler probably not yellow sense that looks like impact uh looks kind of I guess all right anyways we'll just use Gil Sans not the exact same but best we got right now so you scored 15 points make that look a little nicer I think I'll put it like uh I'll put it up down here maybe I'll change the font to make it look bigger all right like so I think that's fine I'm gonna have a redo button here all right once we have our text we're gonna go to our finish e we're gonna set system we're gonna do uh add event OnStar layup OnStar layout add action score final set tax to use scored space and a score and uh points like so and press done so now it should say how much points we scored and we're going to add in a little button right here again the button will be in the we'll be in our props thingy but in this case I didn't put it in there but when you download it it should be there so we're going to insert Sprite okay assistant I'll just have random like uh green button green button that says start and resize this 250 to say 200. that's the wrong way uh 300 by 200 now let's say 150. why not 150 all right we're gonna set uh our brush as oh God that's horrible let me redo re do okay fast very fast guys you have to forgive me for this a behavior we're going to set as sinus ball sine and we're going to set it as size actually from the start yes periods are going to set as 2 magnitude maybe 35 sounds fun nice let's change appears to three let's change a little smaller like so I think I'll bring this down a little bit oh it doesn't look nice how do I make it look nice um if I push that back it doesn't look natural anymore so what if I just leave it up here and like leave points here maybe they will put something in the middle I don't know but this sounds this looks fine let's test our button that's like a pretty appetizing button why not uh why did I don't know why the the font changed but hey I can't bother the phone anymore right so once we've done this we're gonna go file save a single file basketball version five so and now we're gonna decode our reader button so add event system you know actually touch on tap object we're gonna set redo or Sprite let's just change this to redo first redo score final nice add action uh system go to layout game all right so now this will bring us back to this one right here which should be AOkay we're gonna also duplicate our finish so we're gonna duplicate this start or eventually I'd eventually start e oh God I did not mean to name it like that start e double click Start very important right here make sure your event sheet is not linked to finish anymore it's linked to start e all right and we're gonna delete this right here uh like so if you want to make a font or you want to say something with it make sure to say clone object type I'll show you logic type let's just say start oh no that's not good start text oh they change my language I did start text let me say text please all right find lowercase it's whatever uh and we're going to change this to uh let's press start to begin the game press start to begin exhale a little bit more energetic and we're going to change the spine right here click Sloan object type paste that any redo two we're going to change this to start delete this change the color I'm going to change this to Yellow a color yellowish there you go I will paste the entire thing we're going to say start in Black start ah it looks so bad but it's fine all right start and the sign should still be there so we don't have to worry about that perfect let's bring this up all right we're going to start here we're going to add advantage on touch on tap object start done add Action System go to layout game okay bring this in order like so start game finish so let's go to start all right guys we're done with the game oh wow let's go test it out uh if it's something like this just ignore it it's fine press start to begin start go go go go go go go go go go go go go oh that's pretty bad that throw no one making such bad throws don't give me a good throw oh there you go two no no it's getting too low there you go five give me five nice okay now it's starting to move okay go Google in nice oh nice no nice oh man wait oh I forgot to code it dang it I forgot to I've got a change in here uh when it says go to layout game we're gonna change this to go to finish like so okay let's try it one more time guys one more time go go go go and you get high in 10 this time go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go all right looking off to a great start oh this is going great it's going great come on oh my god let's go five already 18 seconds come on don't throw it don't throw all right get it don't throw that's kind of that's kind of cringe pun what no it went over the hoop airball oh all right in too far oh no I didn't make it one more dang it I got nine points and it said you scored nine points and it allows to redo every press redo you come back to this page like so anyways that is our game guys it's a pretty fine basketball game again you guys can make the font I know the game look a lot nicer by you know making the props and the Hoops look like much more cleaner which you know for me I'm not that I'm the best at drawing so it looks like this but yeah this is how to create a fun simple basketball game inside of construct 2. I hope you enjoyed this video see you next one bye
