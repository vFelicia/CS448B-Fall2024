okay not in here oh no no no i don't need to go there run okay i'm almost at the end also uh have you ever wondered what you can build in the sandbox today i will be answering that question in metaverse bootcamp ep3 make sure to subscribe to stay updated on videos like these anyways let's get started so what can you make in the sandbox so before the video goes on i just want to say that we have a piece of land at 19199 come visit us there and let's get back to the video well let's see so today's topic is about what can you make and how to make a basic mini game there's two parts so what can you make has a subcategory that includes action adventure games puzzle games nft galleries social hubs and your home and how to make a basic mini game part two is defeat all enemies quest it's all quest by the way to defeat all enemies collect items and limited time quests let's look at all these topics let's begin with what can you make so you can make adventure games like this where you can fight enemies you can have swords avatars jump platformer etc and it's just a fun action game for people who enjoy them and i got these images from sandboxgame.getbook.io so make sure to check them out the next type of game is a puzzle game the puzzle game is uses your brain a little and is mostly around platform and lava traps etc they are pretty cool and i would recommend to try them out it is one of my most favorite types of games and yeah so that is the puzzle games let's move on to the nft galleries if you like to do art or you create nfts uh you can own land and you can build an nft collection or a gallery that you can display in your land and other people can come visit them and even buy them so you can make them interactive and however you would like it now let's look at social club or your house now this is around multiplayer which means there's going to be other people in there with you so you can have this as your social club where people uh your friends other people can hang out together and you can also make this your house where you and your family members can reside in it and yeah that is some things you can build with your land in the sandbox now let's look at our quests or our mini games so our minigame one is defeat all the enemies quest so we have five enemies you can see right here one two three four five i couldn't really fit them on the screen but yeah you can get the idea kill five enemies and here is the quest uh the most important stuff that we're going to use the counter the quest type is a counter the counter type is death chicken is the tag and amount is five we will look in detail uh later but let's just look at what we're gonna make first so that's we're gonna make let's get into it so let's open up our sandbox game maker let me exit this really quickly okay so now once you have opened it it should come up a page like this uh if you create any games then it should appear over here but we are going to be creating a new one click create new let's name it minigame one or whatever you want to name it uh coding for kids okay now we can select four by four or one by one or two by two whatever i'm gonna do one by one since it is a lot of room i'm gonna say one little land is not little at all it's so big you can do anything on a one by one well mostly anything and let's move on and we click that and let's click create and let me clear out my hot bar really quickly so we can start off from the same page okay there so once we have entered our experience let's create five enemies first so the way to create five enemies enemies um is to go and click l for library click entity and here is all the entities you can use uh i will be using one of the scarier ones so like uh detector bot or no defector bot sorry defector bots so i'll be using the defector bots so i'll grab them and we let's put uh one of them in first uh if we want we could put in our hot bar but i am not doing that since i can just copy them okay once we have this let us select it and we can rename it to chicken or whatever we would like chicken bot and um oh i got the wrong one but it's okay uh once we named it we can set it as invisible or visible i'm going to set it as visible for now we will need to set one of them invisible as our uh how to call it ours are conditioned you can say um like a code uh where it intercepts all of the broadcast and since we can't really have them with any other one or else you know because we have to kill them so they won't exist anymore so we're gonna have to create an invisible one put it at the uh the corners of the map and then make them noncollision and it's just a robot that or entity that we use to intercept our code anyways let's get back to this uh we're gonna turn on collision uh i don't really recommend collision plus gravity because whenever you hit it you have to go chasing it for it like a mile away so just turn on collision and after that we can scroll down a bit more behavior make sure it's melee enemy and you can adjust this uh to your liking but i will have it as the max since it is actually already pretty weak at the max um the health let's turn it on or else it'll be invincible once we turned on health uh let's turn uh let's add a tag so this tag will basically uh set inside of our quest what to know like if this tag so pretend you kill an entity and it has a tag um if the tag is the same one in the quest then it will say that okay it counts one dead okay so let's enter a tag that makes sense i will enter this bot actually chicken bot chicken bot like this click enter and there we go it added the tag inside and after this we can just duplicate it five times so click on it ctrl d and let's click on this tool so we can move it around d ctrl d ctrl d ctrl d okay you can actually do how much amount but you would have to oops you would have to adjust it by yourself inside of the quest itself so i'll just leave it as five for now okay so like it forms a little circle around us and if we were trying to play it right now it would just attack us and if we were to kill all of them it wouldn't really do much so let me try there we go that's two down okay oh that's okay there you go so once we kill all of them it doesn't really do much instead it just it doesn't it's just running it's running around now it's not really doing anything so now let's change that so let's go into rules um and let's click enable and quest click enable let's click add quest right here and we can rename this quest to whatever we want i will say chicken hunt like this and let's tell the player what they have to do to complete this quest kill all the evil chicken robots like this and now we can do unlock quest so uh this auto unlocks i will leave it at that so it like automatically unlocks it right at the beginning of the game uh we can ignore the launch quest too it's auto launch too we can check on quest type though quest type is the counter which will basically count how much times an asset has died or been collected the counter type is either collected objects or deaths i will change it to deaths and then the tag that we want is of course the tag that we set chicken bot is the tag i set um the amount is five so this is how much depth they're going to be uh auto completion yes send message after the quest is completed it will send a message i will send it as chicken wipeout so just press on this thing and then just type in chicken i'll just do chicken wipe okay uh oops i forgot to click add click add right here and now it should you should be all set now let's click add oh i'm sorry not add quest now i can just click out but delete that let's delete that okay there we go let's exit and if we were to play this it wouldn't do anything either um however there would be a change it will go chicken hunt and it will return on our right side of the screen as an hud now let's see if i were to kill some of them it would count like this but if i were to kill the last guy it wouldn't actually make us win instead of just say quest complete this is because there's nothing actually checking or receiving the message um that they sent which is chicken wipeout so we're gonna send we're gonna copy one of these guys and we're gonna put them at the corner of the map so it doesn't oh at the corner of the map so it doesn't get in the way of things oh and we're gonna set it as invisible and we're going to rename it uh let's delete all the tags so it doesn't get confused oh no i clicked on edit logic but it's okay let me delete all the tags there we go let's remove melee enemy and turn it to none then let's remove health too and once it's completely bare and stripped of everything um what we want to do is we want to rename it first let's rename it to uh interceptor interceptor and let's turn off collision so no collision and what we want to do next is we want to add a comparator or not component and let's add in victory so we're going to do on receive message uh and we're going to select this to chicken wipe so now when the chicken wipe has been broadcasted this bot right here will receive it and will make it like make us win so let's try it again okay so our bot is either in that corner that one that one or that one but anyways let's try out our uh rule that we set there we go and there we go there you go now we can win actually and the quest is completed we won one out of one quest complete and it even has a timer and how much kills we got so victory uh and that is how to create our first mini game which is just kill five entities and win so now let's look at the second one i should probably save this remember to save from time to time okay it's almost done and once it says stage that is okay click ok let's move out okay now let's look at our slides again okay so now our second mini game is to collect all items quest this will basically let us collect these little gold coins over here or ancient treasures and it will once we collected them um if we collected all five of them then we will uh basically win the game so here is the quest uh stuff so the quest type is the counter counter type is collected object the tag is gold and amount is five so let's get creating okay let's press click create new and let's name this mini game two coding for kids like this click let's click create new and now it should create a one by one plane area actually you know what let's actually get out first i actually want a desert area so it can have more terrain so we can hide some of the gold and make it more interesting mini game two coding for kids okay sorry if i'm not typing as well the jackets graphs are kind of getting in the way on my keyboard and i can't really type like this but let's just uh go with it so once we created that let's select the theme uh i'll select lake actually and let's click create okay once we did this there we go now we have a lake in the middle um we can hide some gold anywhere on this map basically i'll hide some in the lake too uh so let's get some gold here ancient treasure right here drag it into our hot bar um and let's just click l so why is the world spawn there okay let's drag the world spawn out click on the world spawn and let's move it to a better place i do because i do not want to spawn in the lake it's just not a good place to spawn okay there now the spawn is on the land and let me move that down a bit okay there so once the spawn is on the land let's hide some gold around the map uh you can hide how much you want i will hide only uh only how much five yeah okay i don't know why i can't place it inside of there but it's okay i'll just place on top of the water then i will drag it down from there okay and it's not level yet there okay once it's down there we can hide more around the map um i'll put one there one over there one there and our last one i will also put in the river or not the river sorry lake and let's scroll in a bit let's bring it down oh i need i need to move it over here and push it down like this there we go okay now once we did that uh oh i forgot something it's okay though we can just click on this tool and we can select all of them oh like this okay once we selected all of them what we want to do is we want to click on behavior over here wait never mind click on add components add collectible which means when you hit it it will basically just collect it and let's name this to gold okay and let's add a tag that says gold okay once we added a tag that says gold uh we can just actually test it out first what we can do is we can just run around collect the gold you can see that it goes into our inventory if i were to check on quest items you however you can't really use it for anything so it's just there so yeah we can just run around collect it um but it doesn't really do much you just can collect it let me go get that last piece okay oops there you go they should add drowning in the game it would be much more fun cannot get out the lake oh i can't get out the lake okay let's create a exit wait for the lake a little all right so i couldn't get out of the lake because uh there's you can only jump one by one blocks in the lake um and this is a kind of a problem i i think you should be able to float up into the water surface inside of the lake since it's more more make i mean it makes more sense that you can float inside of a form of water because you can swim i can't place stuff in the water why can't oh well um well we can just delete some blocks here and we can exit from there okay there we go so now we should have an exit way over there um so if we will swim here and we can walk up here and then we can exit here okay perfect so once we did that let's just create our rules or our quest uh click on rules enable quest add quest and let's do collect gold okay actually i'll make it more catchy gold rush okay there we go and our quest description will be find all the hidden gold find all the hidden gold okay and then we're going to just do auto unlock auto launch and our quest type will be counter collected objects and our tag will be gold once we did that we will do auto completion send message after that we will send uh let's send okay you can add it if you don't have it but i'll just add collected and once we send collected oh shoot i accidentally closed it okay once we send collected it will um basically report it to entire map and now let's have another uh another entity that will uh receive it let's have a beaver this time so we'll put it over here that's our beaver oh did not place oh why is it not placing there we go so now let's highlight our beaver let's make it invisible we don't need to rename it actually let's uh remove health let's change prey to none add a component a victory on receive message uh boss not boss dead um collected like this and now we can win actually so tab for playing and gold rush there we go and it should be oh no i fell to the lake no okay well um it should yeah you can see it's on the right of our screen and now let's try uh getting all the gold okay so got the gold and oh i'm underwater okay got that gold and let's exit on our little path we made over here okay there we go and now let's collect the rest of the gold on the map so gold number three there are five pieces of gold we need to find gold number four and of course you can hide them better uh i didn't hide mine so good because i would have trouble finding them myself um but yeah and goal number five there you go victory so that is how to create mini game number two which is to collect gold or easter egg hunt and let's move on to our last one which is in my opinion the most fun okay let's move on so now mini game number three will be limited time quest it's like a maze we can make this made by yourself um of course you don't need to be perfect i am not an experienced uh maze maker uh if you might call it like that but i think i do understand the concept of a maze um and what i did i just pulled up an image of a maze and put it on my second display and i just looked from there and copied down the maze so it would actually you know be a legit maze not just me scribbling some things down but yeah our mini game three is limited time quest and we our quest type is timer seconds to wait is 20 and goal is to survive um obviously the goal over here is you can change it to you actually you can't change it to anything just put out survive because there's actually none for victory so survive is the best since we don't have any mobs here either okay so let's move on to our sandbox let's click edit mode and let's no no i want to save it first okay let's save there we go and let's click out okay let's create new now okay this video has been going on for 20 minutes so i hopefully you stuck with me uh once you click new let's name this minigame three uh coding for kids coding for kids like this theme let's put it as empty for now let's have a one by one let's click create and now i will uh let's use a block that is dignified for a maze um let's see sorry for that uh let's use brown bricks i'm pretty sure that is the most amazed like thing unless there's like tree leaves maybe um like a bush uh a bush maze none okay it's okay um we can just use brown bricks of course but you can use any other blocks you want uh i'll just be using that one actually i'll use the stone bricks i think that looks actually better okay let's close our library and let's have a topdown view the way to change your view is to uh press alt and then just click left or hold left click and you can move around let's move it so it's topdown view oh so it's a top down view like so um and now let's just critter me it doesn't matter where spawn point is we can move it later so i will just bring up an image of a maze right here maze okay and we will click on images uh we don't need to get these complicated ones we only need like a simple but not too simple one like this one maybe we can put it into our tab right here or we can just click save image i'll just click save image save image oh it saves as a web thingy uh it's okay we can just find a new one save image i might just put it on the other link there and then just scroll scroll sorry scrolling a bit and there we go now we can put it on our second screen but for the sake of the video i'll just put it like a tiny uh spot on this screen oh no because it'll disappear anyways so i'll just put on my second monitor i hope that's fine but basically i will put a time lapse on this and uh just create a maze so let's get started [Laughter] do okay now i'm done with the time lapse um and here is my finished result on the maze i think it looks pretty good um and this is just the outline of it so it's actually just a one by one uh just a one height uh how do you call it maze let me fill in those little cracks oh like so so it's just one by one um and let's make it a three by three so just overlay it three times uh don't go like this this will just ruin your whole maze okay instead just go uh just line this row up then line this one like so and let's start up the time lapse again okay now i am done with my maze um i made it all three by three and let's move the spawn point now so let's move this to over here okay once we did this we can actually just play it so tab and we can run through it a little like this um and of course i don't know the maze either so i am getting stuck on a lot of parts but i will not ruin the surprise for myself yet and i will just um let it sit like this first but what we need to do next is we want to go to global parameters go to camera and change it to top down this makes it top down view like so and we can have a easier understanding of what the maze is and we can go into places that we usually won't see like this and you can see that i completed it much much easier because it's uh top down and i would recommend top down too but um there i have multiple ways okay so now we basically are kind of uh we are kind of i call it not we're not done but oops that's the wrong block okay now we just need to set up our um our rules so let's go to rule and let's enable quest add quest let's name this time timer and let's say complete the maze like this you can do auto unlock um auto launch quest type is counter um and we're gonna change this to timer seconds to wait i will change this to 20 seconds and let's leave gold to survive click out and now we will add two two uh animals or entities we're going to put one right at the end of the maze another one somewhere else and we will let's move on to the interceptor first so this is the interceptor let's make invisible collision no collision um let's change behavior from prey to none and let's disable health add component that says victory oh and not victory game over because this one if you run out of time then it's game over uh wait let's go back into rules let's see what our oh message let's change message to fail okay let's change message to fail and once this beaver over here gets the message fail then it will go defeat but however if the other beaver over here that changes to uh none then let's leave health to none let's make this invisible too uh let's add a component that's a victory so on collision meaning if it hits this beaver right here then it will basically win we have to make it collision though we have to enable collision or else it's not going to work so once we did this we will just be able to play it now and it should work so let's do tab and it says timer and then it will have a timer at the end complete the maze quick quick uh this way you can sprint in this too oh i don't think is it no it's not this way no no no no run no no no no it's this way it's this way i remember i remember this way shortcut shortcut shortcut like this and there we go now we hit the beaver and we want so we can just um edit this i think that uh our camera having a top down is a bit too easy so i will change it to first person no first person makes me dizzy i'll just change the third person so now they can just have it like this which is a lot better uh for some times like so because you can't really see much with their with third person so it makes the mage maze more challenging okay not in here oh no no no i don't mean to go in there run okay i'm almost at the end also the end okay and i made it there two seconds to spare there so as you can see we can make it like this it's pretty fun although it takes some time but yeah that's it for today's video i hope you enjoyed and i hope it answered your question on what can you build with the sandbox and here is the answer you can build anything like this also if you're not subscribed make sure to subscribe to stay tuned for videos like these i spend a lot of time making these videos so yeah if you could subscribe thank you very much and goodbye
