hello my name is jeremy and today i'm going to be showing you how to make lists in python right now we're in python module so why don't we get started first of all what is a list a list is basically an array it's like a variable but instead of storing only one number or um or string this can store many strings which is multiple of them and i think it's going to be very useful so i'm going to teach you how to do it first of all let's see what's a list in real life a closet right it holds books um like if you're like me and put books in it um shoes clothes and jackets so why don't we set a closet as a list so first of all to make a list you need to do closet um or whatever you want as a list equals to and then put a bracket which is right below the plus sign and then we do what is in the closet so there is clothes as you said clothes um remember to put the single quotes slash quotation marks clothes uh books um jackets and finally shoes okay and you have to keep oh sorry and you also need to keep in mind that jackets i mean um this list is counting from zero so close is zero number zero number one number two number three so if you want choose which number is it three right yes because it counts from zero so don't get confused with that because we are going to have to pull specific ones later on so yeah keep in mind that it starts from zero so moving on is to add something to the list so what we say is to append it and so this is how to do it so we put the list name in dot append this is how you call a pen and then you put in what you want to append so like i want to append oops yeah i want to append uh sneakers then because i just bought them like this enter and then print print closet which is to print the whole list print and then you got to do these flaws here we go so print closet and let's see what it does um well we have to run it i forgot run module and it says oh you see uh where should i save it i'm just saving my desktop then okay and save downloads okay save okay so right now i'm actually in the wrong thing we're not doing python module but we're actually going to do python shell which is different so search up id leu with me sorry for that guys so this is kind of similar but instead of that okay just paste it okay just paste it and then sorry and then um after this uh like this right guys then what we do is we just do something like this click enter and then we just type in sorry type copy this okay put it in here copy this and then click enter and put it back in so as you can see it's added in sneakers and um so there's clothes book jackets choosing sneakers and here we are so we have at first it was closed book jackets and shoes but now we added sneakers in what if the um the person with the closet so pretend me i i'm about to go to school so i take my books out and uh what will happen to the list the book is going to be gone right so to make something get removed is pretty simple it's kind of like a pen closet dot remove and then what do we want um which one do we want to remove so we put a bracket we put a bracket and then we put um closet wait bracket right yeah bracket and then after that we put claws uh oh oopsies over here it needs to be a parenthesis not this bracket okay so we put closet and uh now a bracket and we put what number we want out okay so books is number one so you put it in like that and click enter now you print it print closet like so enter see and books is gone so i took the books out went to school and it came back so um i want to put my books back in my closet so how do i put it back a pen append is um putting it back but uh it's putting it it's also there's another one and this one is to put a specific position a pen is just putting in like right here the end as you can see sneakers but this one that i'm going to do it's going to put in the position like an accurate one so i'm going to show you what it is it's called insert um it's like the other ones the code is similar closet dot insert and then like what do we want to insert we want to insert uh our books back right so we're going to say um parentheses and then where do we want it so this is what this is zero one two and three right so i'm going to put it back in the same position which is number one so one comma little bun bun one comma space and then we're going to put uh what we want in so we want the books back in right books and then we put the parentheses in so now we're going to print it print closet oh closet right yeah closet and then click enter and there we go boxes back into the closet nice and back it's home okay now we're going to show another thing for remove so pretend um my shoes are getting old okay and i want to just like get rid of it well how do i do that you can you remove but there's another easier um another alternative way which is called um deleting so uh first of all what we do is we do dell stands for delete and then what we do is we go and we label which one we want so uh closet closet don't put you don't need to put parentheses around this and we put a bracket and say choose right they're getting old so choose is number three and three like this boom and then we print closet let's see if shoes is gone and tada shoes is gone so instead of shoes i have the sneakers now because the shoes are old now they're gone okay so it's now what if i want like i have two money in my list like too many in my list so i want to find the specific one i want to print it out so what i do is i um i go like this print and then uh garage so we're gonna um print a specific one so what if i want my jackets and you couldn't find it from my clothes right so jackets is number two so like this and there you go we printed the jacket oh no whoopsies now um you don't have to put in the uh how do you call it you don't need to put in uh the uh you need to put like the negative sign in front of it first so well this is a way i uh think you need to do it so garage right and then like this but instead of doing that we're going to do negative so now it's going to be a little bit more complicated this way works for me but for some reason i this way doesn't work hmm that's kind of weird oh what a prank garage i think a closet is a garage oh my goodness jimmy what in the world okay so um closet sorry guys they bring um closet two and this should work i'm like why doesn't it work there we go jackets and then he realized um so yeah don't forget to print the correct one my brain just stopped working for some reason and just print garage so yeah remember to print the exact name of your list it's very case sensitive and you can't even mix up a capitalization okay so that's one way of doing it i just spoiled you the second way oh why so another way is to print um it's an alternative i don't know why anybody would want to use this way but um it's another way i guess so instead of counting 0 1 2 3 we're going to count backwards so this is going to be starting from y not 0 1 two three four more specifically negative one negative two negative three negative four okay so now we're going to print it using that method print closet closet and um negative which one so we want jackets again so it needs to be negative two like so um whoops one and like that and now it's going to be jacket see so you could count backwards or forwards it just depends okay so after this um what else are we going to do with lists what other commands is there what if you have a specific um a specific clothe that you really like so you could name it something like this so we're going to say um and you're going to like just pop it off so which means dot pop it means just like use it one time and it's gone so what if we're going to set um it as one of my books so we could say harry potter okay that's one of my favorite books harry potter um equals harry potter equals um how about let's just say hp for short because it's pretty long hp equals um closet right wait parentheses i think closet wait no do you need no i don't think you do okay just how let's try this closet dot pop and then we select which one we want so i would want um which one books right yeah so let's just do the fancy way so negative three there we go and then now we click enter and this is going to pop it off which means that it's just going to take it out single use it shows one and then it's like basically deleting and printing at the same time so if we say print print hp i just realized it says hp also stands for health points oh and games you know and click enter it says books but what if we do this again do you think it's going to be books do you no it wouldn't be books i mean sorry yes it would be books because it's going to pop it off but if we however just print um print uh how do you call it closet right if we would just print closet then this would not have books okay because we popped it off but if we just say print hp then there is going to be books because it's like separated from each other basically and yeah that's um pop okay moving on is to print the what if we would want to change something without having to delete it and append it or um insert it again then what we would do is we would do like the name of the very uh the the list first right guys and then we would um we would do over here and which one do you want to change so how let's change clothes okay so it's zero let's change clothes to hmm sweatshirts sweat wait let me just sweat shirts okay just like so click enter now we print closet let's see and kaboom boo you go sweatshirts i changed clothes to sweatshirts and um yeah that's pretty much everything with the um list so i hope you guys found something useful in this video i really do like take a lot of time learning this and coming to teach you guys so yeah if you would like then that would be great and subscribe thank you a lot and see you next video bye
