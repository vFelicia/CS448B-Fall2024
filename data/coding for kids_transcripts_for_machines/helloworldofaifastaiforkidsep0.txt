hello everybody it's your banana boy jemmy here and today i will be giving you a brief overview on fastai for kids today is episode zero and we're just going to be looking at some fundamentals of fastai and i'm going to be explaining in the most simple ways so that even kids can understand what an ai is and um next episode i'm going to be showing you how to build an ai in 10 minutes or more and uh so stay around for that so fast ai slogan is making your own networks uncool again what does this slogan mean so basically this slogan is uh to motivate them to basically make uh ai more accessible by everybody to make it more simple and not only the good people like the smart people uh can know what an ai is and can build one and instead everybody can do it even like kid and uh people who don't have like a good degree in math or a phd and yeah so that's what their slogan means what is deep learning basically what is an ai deep learning is a computer technique that pulls information important information out of like your general data which you put in so you put in like maybe cats and then you get out like uh these specific type of cats like pretend uh bun bun is a exotic short hair so you pull out that specific type of cat out of like these huge images of cats like a thousand uh maybe ten 000 images and you pull out those specific view what is fastai so if you want to know more about fastai you can go to their website but basically they're a program that we're going to use in order to create our ai that we're going to be making and the founders of fast ai is professor jeremy howard and professor rachel thomas um these two are really good at ai stuff rachel is uh better at math and then jeremy is really good at deep learning and stuff so what can an ai do so this is basically some highlight of an ai there is much more than this but this is only a few things it can do so the first thing it can do is image generation have you ever saw those white black and white photos of people in the olden days like during war or like uh i don't know like your grandmother grandfather they have like black and white photos and a i can actually turn those photos into um a colorful one like so you can see right here this is black and white one now this is a colorful one um this is made by ai and the next one is autopilot so tesla which is like the electric car company that elon musk i'm not sure if you heard of it but they basically can create uh and you can drive your car to like mcdonald's safely um and not hurt anybody so yeah they use ai for that too and the also recommendation systems like youtube facebook or any other social media platforms that are like big uh they will use recommendation system to like give you some content that you might like uh depending on your previous uh likes and subscribe uh subscriptions like this picture right here you buy this duff can and then they compare something similar to it this stuff tshirt and then they recommend it to you just like so and now let's meet our master which who's going to be training um our course wizard fast tie so once upon a time there lived a young small elephant named foodie duty foodie duty likes to travel and eat foods that he never tried before all around the world however there was a problem foodie duty cannot eat anything spicy or any dish that contains shrimp because he's allergic to shrimp and the way he solved this problem was that anything that has a red color on it then he's going to assume it's spicy anything that has a yellow or pale color he's going to assume it's not spicy and then the way he would avoid shrimp is that if a dish has a shrimp then he would avoid it but if he could he couldn't see the shrimp then he would give the dish a try however these senses were really inaccurate and he couldn't depend on it so once uh so one time when sweetie duty was traveling he met a wizard called fast tie fast thai then told him the secret spell of depot ironing deeper ironing will make foodie droopy grow a magic eye for thai food this magic eye is to help foodie duty classify thai food under name ingredients spiciness and calories and every time foodie duty trained with its magic spell deeplearning his magic eye got more powerful and then the more powerful he got the more accurate his magic eye is until one day he was super accurate with all his decisions so foodie duty now travels worldwide to help other people classify thai food on their names spiciness calories and ingredients so once we've met our master wizard fast high we're going to be looking at some tools we're going to be using so the first tool is google and a google account and the second tool comes along with a google account which is a google collab um these two you need a google account first so if you don't know how to sign up then just go to youtube there's a bunch of good tutorials and uh once you're there you can pause the video and come back for whoever has a google account we can now just go ahead and follow my steps so go into a new tab control t and just do um type in the search bar google collab like so and press enter it should come up into a page something like this if there's ad in front then just go to the second one which has the link collab.research.google.com click on it and it should comment it shouldn't come up in the page like this uh it should go into that file but it shouldn't have uh any of that um uh files that i had click close and now you should come into a page like me welcome to collab uh but we're not gonna be really using this we're gonna go in files and we're gonna click new notebook over here and we can just x this one out if we don't want it and once we're here uh look we can wait a bit and there we go once we're here we can rename this um to anything we would like i'm renaming it to uh past ai ep 0 oh i shouldn't put point there it might mess something up there you go and now we can have we have like lines here and oh there's doggos i will show you how to do it your page probably looks white right now if you just came in um so i will show you how to change it to my settings click on tools uh settings and then in here select the theme too dark if you want it if you have light it's pretty bright for me i don't really like it it's way too bright so tools settings and to dark dark looks much better um now for the doggos and cats what you want to do is you want to click on miscellaneous and um i don't think that's it uh oh this is also another one this is pretty cool but don't click on power click on these two enable them if you disable them then the doggos and cats don't come anymore so enable both of them and the dog boost and catch will come power level if you oh my god um if you click many many power okay let's see what it is click save now go to a search bar and let's let's type oh oh there's a little sparks okay combo counter okay now what if what if we would have what if we do this oh oh it's lagging a little bit oh i don't oh ah yes the big combo 225 oh 400 combo 300 400 yeah you can see that it just lagged your computer out too much i'm getting like four frames now or something but uh yeah so don't do this um i mean you can do it if you want to but like you gotta type a bit slower you know like this i mean it looks pretty cool it's like sparks but it's not so yeah don't uh do that don't add the power i mean you could but like it's going to be very laggy so just go turn it off tools settings and just open up here miscellaneous and just turn to some power if you want it just does it some random time but i'm going to select no power because i don't like that it distracts me from coding too so yeah that is it and now we're going to look into our next slide which is how to optimize our google collab so i already showed you how to display mode light and dark and i already showed you the secret setting which is dog and cats but we're going to be looking at how to activate our gpu what is a gpu gpu is a graph it's a graphic card which basically allows you to run neural networks hundreds of times faster than a cpu can so we have to set it to gpu or else it'll be default to cpu so yeah let's go back into our collab file and we're going to click on a video i'm pretty sure and we're going to click on notebook info uh nope not this uh edit uh notebook settings there you go and hardware selector accelerator um we can see it's none right now select gpu right here but keep in mind that um to get most out of cool app avoid using gpu unless you need one so basically uh if you aren't using it then using google cloud then you should turn it off because we are sharing another we are sharing these computers with other people all around the world and yeah so you should keep in mind that uh if you're using it like but you're actually not typing or coding anything then you should turn it off because other people's work will slow down too but i think it will automatically disconnect you if you're like afk so click save after that and your thing should be running pretty fast now now i'm going to show you some simplest coding stuff so adding code and text um simple math printing and commenting well let's get right into it these are just the basics of code uh collab so these are plus code and plus text you can see our new line here if we type something in there and we want to get like a new line if we press enter it doesn't work right i'm pretty sure there's a command for this but oh there you go uh if you there's another command if you just want to create a new one is shift enter but you can see that it's going to run this code too so um don't do it yet if you don't want to run this code uh you wait until it's initialized and connected in order to actually run it's going to come from an error because it doesn't understand it but let's delete this and click on add code and you can see it a new line pops up and you can keep on adding how much lines you ever want or control z this back oh it can't oh i'll just delete some all right and you can also add text um text is different because you aren't actually uh going to um run anything for the code it's just going to be like a little reminder for you or like for other people who are sharing your notebook to so this is a text like so and then press shift enter and then you can see it's enabled here and a good thing about collab is let me delete this really quick um you can actually make it bold or you can make it any com oh that's not it any uh size you want the more this you add i'm pretty sure the bigger it is and you can see it resets at three so yeah so now let's press shift enter and see how big it is does it did i not increase the size yeah as you can see the size definitely increased um and that's how you play around with the uh the text and stuff so yeah have fun with that the next part we're gonna be looking at is simple math so simple math we're just gonna be doing one plus one you can use this as a calculator for your math math problems from school too one plus one shift enter or just uh sh i don't control enter i'm pretty sure yeah i haven't used collab in quite a while ctrl enter two equals to two um you can do whatever equation you'd like whatever plus this much control enter control enters to run and it gives you the correct answer so the next one we're going to be looking at is printing so let's print out a code printing is basically making the program type for us so we're going to be printing um hello ai world just like in our first slide so let's print it out so first off type print this is the command to print print like so and once you've done this put in parentheses click nine shift and nine then it'll give you a whole bracket you don't need to press shift nine and then zero um once you've done this uh click back into the bracket and add uh either a double quote or a single quote i like single quotes because i don't need to press shift but it's basically up to you now we're going to print hello ai world like so and when you press ctrl enter you can see that it goes hello ai world so that is how to print simple commands and the next last one we're gonna do is commenting commenting is really easy so pretend we want to like have a mental note to ourselves without creating a text we can just do hashtag let's see where hashtag is hashtag i can't find a hashtag oh there you go hashtag is number three so shift 3 and then just type something in there this is a comment and will not affect a factor effect unless you affect the code and you can see we can do control enter and it will just do the same code over but if we didn't have the hashtag here we can just click shift uh control enter again let's see what it does you can see it comes up an error but if we put hashtag we can do shift enter or not shift enter control enter and it will just go hello ai world so this is it for today's video i hope you enjoyed it stay tuned for the next one we're going to be creating an ai in less than 10 minutes or maybe more but very little it's very easy and i will show you how to do it so stay tuned for that
