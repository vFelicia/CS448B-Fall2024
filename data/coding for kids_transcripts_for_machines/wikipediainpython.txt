bye saudi crap hello my name is jeremy and today i'm going to be teaching you how to make a wikipedia program in python first of all you would need to um insert the document from microsoft which is a plugin and what it does is it can like um do stuff in microsoft word which is the on the docs and oh yeah first of all i want to mention that i'm in idl e python right now so yeah open that up in your computer and yeah so after we imported the document let's import wikipedia because we're also going to pull information from the wikipedia and paste inside the document so after we did that let's define what wikipedia wiki is wiki um there's a key word comma lang equals english so the lang is a variable and en is um english like the quote for english so wikipedia dot set playing um language to learn so if you want to change the language you could just change it up here uh yeah moving on to data data is wikipedia.summary which is another code for the plugin of wikipedia and then data2's we computed that page to get the whole page and data um this is also data2 it's that data2.content so i think it's going to print it or something and then doc um equal to document so this is to create the document so it will automatically generate a new microsoft for us it will like make it and then doc dot add heading so now this is kind of like crazy because you can actually edit the whole entire document um in python so add a heading with the keyword um means like so you type like spacing right and then it comes um in the heading equals to space so yeah it's gonna be pretty cool and then doc dot add paragraph which is data2 so as you can see it's getting the whole page and it's going to put it in the paragraph the doc save which is to control s the name is going to be the keyword plus dot dot x which is the um the last name of documents so um like the keyword is space based dot x yeah um that's how to what that's where key is and we print successfully created so they would know that it's done now moving on is that um wikipedia.lang en this one is to also set the language and from tk inter import and this one's to import the ttk and this one's to import the message box which is like the text box where we could like enter and type stuff in so yeah and gui equals tk gi dot title wikipedia this is to make our um main menu that pops up and ui.geometry is to um resize our main menu to how much we want so right now it's currently 400 times 300 yeah so it's how big it is and in the font number one it goes send a new um 15 so this is the font and this is the size of the font yeah moving on to setting the l variable is to make um the name of the i mean the text inside the message box and it's going to be like enter your topic here so you would be uh um like a little text to show you where you enter your topic and then l.pack and then after that we're going to do uh on that what the important code right here is to e dot pack paddy equal 10 okay uh remember that also um this is for the message boxer to type it in right when um like that little this thing message box right here we're going to resize it and we're going to set how big um pretty sure this is how big it is like the width and font equals to font one which is essaying a new as i told you so when they type it that's going to be how big and what font it is moving on is um defined search so what is search the keyword equals v underscore search dot get this is to grab the information from the text box and search it up in wikipedia so as you can see language sorry sorry um so wiki keyword language so they're gonna search it up on wikipedia um after that we're going to show info successfully recorded which means that they're going to um tell the person who's using this program that they have successfully got the information from wikipedia and for um except right here in case like they just type something random in or something that doesn't make sense then the program is going to tell them that uh keyword or please enter your search again so like they would have to be more specific or they just have to like find a different topic now this is almost done b1 you go to ttk button and um text goes to search so this is like the button that you click when you want to search and in there it's going to have a text which is searched so they would know what this button does okay so now here is to create um a check mark for what language you want to set it this is getting a little fancy because um if you can select the language uh you can like do many other things with it and instead of making it a column straight down we're going to make it horizontal uh so how we do it is over here row goes to zero column goes to zero and then continue column equal one column go to two after that put the gui main loop in and then we're good and yeah let's try running this program it's pretty fun so here we are in our shell and what do we want to search up uh let me take it to english what do we want to search up um code how about no no how about okay let's search it up and please enter your search again so they couldn't find our thing how let's just do uh cats maybe okay search and yeah there we go successfully created so now we should have it in where we saved our idle so go to where you save your ido okay and here it is cat open it up as you can see the heading is cats and the cat the felis caddis um is like a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal and as you can see it's like our the whole thing got in um which is really cool actually uh this is really really easy for school projects and i think it should be really useful how about let's try typing something random in like something that the program won't know what we meant um come over here search it up okay just blue right in and switch it up please enter your search again there we go how about we're going to do chinese now cats or they need to be typed into these i'm not sure yeah it needs to be typed in chinese too in order to get chinese so yeah english it works and um yeah that's it for this one and see you next video bye
