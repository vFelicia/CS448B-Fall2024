hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be giving a brief overview on the sandbox there are two technologies that are going to change the world there is the ai which i did a project on in the past and there is the blockchain now the blockchain i never did a project on and i don't really understand yet and i love coding games so i thought why not learn about blockchains and code at the same time or not even code just play the game and that's where the sandbox comes in the sandbox is a game that uses the blockchain technology as their main function so i thought why not play it and i will be giving you a brief overview on the sandbox right now so first off what is the sandbox the sandbox is a virtual world where creators and people all around the world can share ideas and make 3d models using voxels they can also monetize their artwork into the marketplace and from then programmers or people who don't even have experience and want to code a game in 3d can use those assets for their game and then they can publish their game to the marketplace okay now once we know what sandbox is let's look at a further detail so here is a map of the sandbox now this is what it looks like it might look a little complicated but i will explain it to you so let's look at this top row first there are the main tokens which is there is the sand which is the currency there is land which is kind of like in real life there you can buy sell uh or rent land there is some assets which is basically 3d models of things there's gems and catalyst and i'll explain about those later and there is the main products these products are going to basically let us create stuff sell stuff and uh make some games so there is the box edit and the vox edit is used to create 3d models the marketplace is used to sell buy and do it basically trading everything in the marketplace and there is the game maker the game maker doesn't require any coding experience you can just uh code a 3d game using this uh product and there is the game client which is the players that just play the game so this is these are the main products of the sandbox now let's look at what we can do as normal players so there is of course the centralized part which is the sandbox team they are basically the headquarters and there is the decentralized part which is what we can do we can be a sand owner which means we own the currency um and we can be a land owner which means we can own a part of the land in the metaverse and these two are part of the governance and if we want to do anything else like being an artist we can do that we can be a game designer and a player so now let's take a look at our game maker so as a game maker we can do a lot of things basically we can buy and sell nfts not buy and sell sorry buy and use nfts from the marketplace and for our game once we did that we can publish our games to the to other people to play um such as the game clients they can pay to play our game and we will get the money from that also the tsb foundation which is the treasury of the sandbox will pay us to make a mini game and we can also rent and buy land to publish our game to the metaverse so the how the land works is that inside of the metaverse there is 166 thousand uh 646 land and you can buy one of those lands or rent them and you can publish your games to there and people can actually play it okay once we know what the game maker does let's look at how they get their attributes so like nft for example when they use it for you know uh their games how do they get that well they get supplied by the vox editors the vox editors are 3d artists that uh just create nfts or 3d models and they can create some animations with it too and they will create it and they will sell it to the marketplace once somebody buys it they'll get 95 of the profit and the rest five percent will go to the tsb foundation which is a treasury and then the treasury will then pay the vox editors for the work that they have done okay now let's look at the game client so the game client is basically the players who just play the game i guess and once they play the game they actually need to pay to play the game makers game that they created and once they did that uh they can actually earn money by doing so the tsp foundation will give them uh more money if they play more however the concept behind this is not uh so open yet there will be more information coming in the future but currently it is the concept that the more you play the more you earn once they did that they can also buy and sell nfts just like the box editor but instead of creating it they can buy and sell it again and yeah that is the game client and let's now take a look at the these two right here these two icons are if we look back to the beginning they are the sand owner and the landowner so the game makers can be a land owner and a sand owner too as you can see there is interaction between these two but basically what these two can do is they can staking to upgrade their nfts so they can have avatars and customization and equipment and gems so now let's take a look at what gems does we probably know what avatars and customization is right so we just customize our avatar to make it look cool have special powers and the special powers is where the gems come in so the gems is basically some power ups we can have there are five gems this is the power gem the defense gem the gem sorry the speed gem the magic gem and the luck gem and you drink some water and you can put the max four gems into an attribute so uh basically if you have a tier one catalyst now a catalyst is the amount of gems you can put into your uh character so if you have a tier one catalyst you can only put one gem if you have a tier two catalyst you can put in two gems tier three three gems four gems um and you have max until four so you can have five gems you can only have four and in those four gems you can put any gems inside there it doesn't matter if they're repeating or not so you can have your character super fast super strong super defense or maybe just uh super strong super defense a super speed and luck or you can full luck i don't know and yeah that is what the gems and catalyst does okay now let's look at the uh where is it uh here we can see now the tsp foundation there it can uh it pays a lot of people actually it pays the game maker it pays the of these people which i will be explaining later it pays the players to play the game and it pays the creators of the 3d voxels which is the box editors and now let's take a look at this so what do they pay so basically when you own a piece of land the more money you put onto your land uh the basically the more money you will get it's kind of like with the bank if you put a lot of money cash inside of the bank then when the when you get you try to get it back or like receive the money you'll get more in return so this is kind of like what it does if you put more money into your land you will get more money back so it's profit basically and yeah that is most of the sandbox i hope you found this useful if you do please leave like and thank you very much for watching see you next one bye
