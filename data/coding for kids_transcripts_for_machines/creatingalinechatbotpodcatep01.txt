hello my name is jemmy hi i'm abby and uh today we're gonna have abby in the video because no reason and um so yeah let's get into it so today's uh brief overview is on creating a line chatbot uh just like i did earlier but this time uh i'm going to have it in like it's like a series not like all in one video so yeah let's begin so today we're just going to make it so that it actually like um you it exists but it doesn't really do much yet right after yes yeah she doesn't okay moving on so yeah let's start so first thing you have to do is you just come into line developer why why are you laughing laughing okay well we come in you search up line developer in google or insert any search engine and then you click online developer after that you should appear into this uh website right now i am currently signed in but if you're not then let me just sign up log out um like so then you should appear in this page and then click login i'm gonna have to blur out my uh gmail uh and then click log either log in with line but i i'm logging in with business account um if you don't even have an account click create account and then you can just sign up with email and after that just fill in the forms and then you should be registered and if you did that then um and you should click on here log in with business email and then just click login like so and then here are my two recent chat bots uh this one i just made to like test and just practice doing it um but yeah let's create a new one so your page shouldn't look like mine instead should say like there is currently no uh providers or something but um anyways you should appear in this sort of page and then there should be a green button in the middle called create and click on create then after that name your chatbot so i'll name it bun bun bot or no podcast podcast podcat box yeah that mistake was okay podcast okay um let's click create and then in here we should come into this page after you click create uh it should say like this provider doesn't have any channels yet and then you click on this create a messaging api channel and once you did that you should be left with a a lot of forms and i'll teach i'll show you how to fill um in each of them and the one i had some problem with is down here oh if i choose like this one right and then i just choose here yeah it doesn't appear for me um so what i do is i click on reload uh this is in category and subcategory subcategory it doesn't appear so i'm going to click reload and it should appear now this is a problem i encountered uh and i have to okay it doesn't okay why does not work anymore maybe we have to fill out this first uh well anyways let's just insert a picture this is like a channel i can i don't know what to insert yet i'll just say cat bobcat all right and then you can insert a picture like this um oh i don't want to watch that i just want to jf because it can you can't insert gif pop let's save image click save and then just put it there oh wait you can't drag drop okay then well yeah that is our um cat cat podcast bot um and then after that we will just name it so channel name i'll just name this chat chat 101 and then here's channel description chats with line like so um now here we might have a problem if i do that i can i still no i can't select it i don't know why but let's try reloading it then hey you know how to do this what ah here i don't know it just it's random it's random okay so we got it now for something on top no i oh i fill up my top i reload then i come back and refill the things i fulfilled already and then let's enter our channel name chats with line and then let's put in our picture like so um and then uh now we selected it i don't really understand the category but you can select any and then just select the sub category i'm going to select it as computer i selected this one as website and blog um it's not actually about website and blog i can just uh what is it uh i don't know um oh an expert yes i'm an expert i'm an expert um um i'm not good at any of this um listen to pick a random one parkour yes no no this is just um are you a writer yeah there you go funny um yeah okay uh i'm uh i'm an expert at being funny um and okay let's move on okay uh so and here's just your email address and stuff and after that um you just have to hit on i have a these two buttons and being a good citizen i will read both of them right okay so what's coming to play okay guys so i just finished reading both of them and uh they were pretty long but then i have accepted and i basically like uh went through my mind and they processed it i thought about it really like very much um and you and i think i agreed to both of them right you didn't read it but i read it so um i read both of them it was no i didn't um and then it was really really thoughtful but i think i agree to it so i'll double check that and i'll click create and then click ok then click uh yum and i can just close that all right and then we just have to wait for a bit while it creates like so and um once it does that however we should appear in this page uh and in here we have like lots of stuff like channel id yeah i can i don't know yeah i know right i don't understand why but um what we're going to be looking at here is if you click on this link line official account manager then should pop up into this page and in here what we want to do is we want to uh where is it oh we want to click in chat and go to response mode so we go into line line uh official account manager then click on chats and then click on go to response mode and then here we should you have the screen then we do greeting message settings so this is okay so this is when like um so this is when like you add friends with the bot and then the bot will just say like hello blah blah thank you for being friends with blah blah and then it just has a message at the end you can personalize this message so i'm doing like just change it to english hello there that and then i'll put what get this bear out yeah i don't like the beer like that and then let's get an emoji um no um okay don't go too bad because we might yeah frame um uh we'll just do uh something nice like a ramen like a light bulb fire it so it decides that's great let's just do this no i don't like that oh my god where's the cat i want a cat there is no cat this is a cat oh it's a wolf no it's a cat okay yeah fine well whatever we'll do a cat and then we'll just delete this one like so and then um hello there blah blah thank you for being thank you for being here thank you for being a friend with uh no no with account name uh i am there i am there i am account name like account name shot bot called podcat um contact me and hey contact me if you need mental support um chatbot yeah okay there that's just scrambling chatbot yeah okay whatever um and then after that we'll just click save save changes click save and then it says saved after that we can just uh we're done with this and what we do is we want to go out and then we want to search uh dialog box or dialog flow sorry dialog flow i already searched it so it came up the link but just you just search up the dialog flow and click on the first link and like so all right now after that we're going to uh go into like where is it integrations and then that's right i'm pretty sure yeah um and then we can click on wait no i have to create an agent first so we go to test so view create new agent um yours should come up like up here but since mine's already signed in i can't so i'll just click create new agent um like so and then we'll just name our age oh gosh that's a lot of things i typed back um okay just don't look at that um i'm just gonna go uh let's just say agent called podcat right okay we'll go back here and go like that okay now podcat and then it will just stop oh and you'll just you can set the uh the language to something and yeah click create we can click create after that um and then it will just say working and then it's going to be a little um slow or like long time but it's okay it should come pretty soon uh last time we did this i waited for around two or two hours i can't wait two hours hey you can't why not um hi you got sticked bugged why are we still here just to suffer um well okay continue yeah probably um and uh we go to education we go after that once we created it let's make sure that our agent is podcat okay once we did that we'll go to inter integrations and then we will scroll down to line click online and then you have some forms to fill out but don't worry oh it's secret what we do is we go to line developers this um this one line developer our link and then what we do is we just copy the channel id first which is in basic settings go back to dialog box and paste it in after that we will need the channel secret which is a little bit lower and here um that's our secret and click copy and click copy what do you expect um like and paste it and channel access token what you do is we go over to messaging api scroll down a bit and um channel access token right here click issue and then it should give us a very long link click copy go back to dialog flow and paste it in after that click start and there should be a link that appears in here we will copy that and we'll go back into our line developer and we will click on um webhook settings web code url click edit and paste and update like so and after this uh we can just do we know we don't take that um and after this we can check if our bot actually is here by using this link in line so i will be recording my ipad screen in there so um yeah let's do it click copy and i'll just send it to my mail or in telegram and then i'll just open it into my ipad all right let's do a dual screen thing okay guys so i try my best to sync up the ipad screen with my camera but even though it's a little bit off um i think you will get you're trying to reach for the ball up you'll get the gist of it so right now i'm in line um in my ipad screen and uh what we do to check if our body is actually here we click on uh put on our friends and then we click on add friends and then after that we click on ha or find and then we click on id and then we just paste our id that we had like so and then after that we click search and there we have it podcat 101. um and now we just do or add friend and there we go and then after that let's go into the chat okay let me see uh where is where is where is that where's that card who is it what's going to change oh here's chat and then here and then you can see there hello there gemmy um thank you for being friends with podcat101 i am podcat 101's chatbot called podcat oh god that's so complicated contact contact me if you need mental support but right now if we print in like okay or something right it'll just return the default message that line has like so but um in like the future we will improve on that and we'll make it more advanced so yeah that's it for today's video it was quite a long one but yep yeah all right see ya bye can i bring
