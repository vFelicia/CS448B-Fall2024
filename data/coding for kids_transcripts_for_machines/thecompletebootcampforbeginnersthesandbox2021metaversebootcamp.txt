there we go all right so now it hurts us and we kill it and this thing heals us yay there we go we can climb back out okay hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be giving a brief overview on the sandbox and today we're going to be looking at the beginner tutorial of the sandbox um the beginner tutorial is one second let me bring it up so the beginner tutorials is one section inside of the sandbox um guidelines and it is down here that i was the link and for this website will be in the description so if you want to go look at it then you can um inside of the tutorials section we have the beginner tutorials the medium tutorials and the advanced tutorials right now we will be doing the beginner one and we will do the door and key system moving platforms blocks that damage slash kill you displaying external nfts triggering a trigger victory killing a boss quest set up from start to finish and collecting objects to heal or damage we're going to be skipping spawn points and teleporting because i don't have too much information on that yet but i will try to make that as soon as possible but anyways i will show you um one second let obs come in okay i will show you what we're going to be doing so i'm going to hop into my premade um how you call it premade uh not data set but why they see this premade game uh and this is kind of what we're gonna be doing so we start off here and uh we have a quest open the door right so open the door and the quest description is click the key and open the door right now the door might have looked the door might look opened but it's actually not um you can't walk through it so you have to collect this key first like so and now it you can walk through it uh and after that a new um quest comes up collect the keys but we're not there yet uh the this one is the moving platform where the platform moves around and you can use this for your parkour or hobby games uh that there's moving platforms and you can even use that as an elevator to make it go like up or down uh you can make it go sideways anywhere you like and this one is block slash that damages slash kill you so i made it so that this lava pit right here it doesn't insta kill you but it makes it so that it takes uh it takes 25 uh hp so let's go in it and there you go you can see our hp decreased by 25 um but yeah that is the blocks that damage slash kill you uh another one is that some people was wondering if like we could do it with water if like they could drown in water well you can use this method and make the water take like uh damage you by two or one um depending on how much time you're in the water but yeah you can use this method for that too and the next one is displaying external nfts so this one is very handy when you want to have an nft gallery um if you were to like have any art pieces you want to show in to uh show inside of your land then you can use this method to display the nfts um and then this one is for like an adventure game where there's a there's the thing that hurts you and then there's another one that heals you so you can see the healer and the void attacks you um so yeah so it hurts you like so and this healer right here uh gives you more your hp back by five like so and now we're at the quest where to grab all the silver keys so we have one two three and we need to grab all of them again this could be used for an adventure slash puzzle game you can combine this one with the moving platform one to make it more interesting um but yeah that is the quest and then the last one is um to kill a boss and have it finished so killing a boss will trigger a victory so here's the boss um and then you kill it like so um like there and then victory and here is all the all of the huds are popping up and yeah that is what we're going to be creating today um anyways let's get started um let me open my google so i can see what we need to do for some reason my sandbox keep on disappearing every time i open a new screen so i'm going to have to wait with obs a little bit there we go and let's click create new and i will name this one beginner uh sandbox like so you can name it whatever you want i will have the theme as empty and the land size to be one by one okay once we click create um it should appear something like this uh what i work what i would recommend to do right now is i would just go into one of the corners like this one um and then i will just get a transparent block here let me clear my inventory really quick so we can start off together all right so first we what we want to search up for is by the way if you open an inventory you need to click l the first thing we need to search up is transparent trans or just trans in general one second i'm sorry um trans uh white trend block transparent put that in our first slot another one is a you call it grass block um and i'll put in my fourth slot because uh those are on my mouse and uh so we need a grass block because it it you can be it can be used as a building block and sometimes we destroy the ground so we need to use the grass to patch it back up grass one is the same one as this one and another one we need to use is the door so door i recommend the desert building door as it's not as confusing as these two the large space door is kind of uh glitchy um but the wooden door uh i think it's kind of different too so just grab the desert building door and then grab some keys so gold search for gold grab the gold key in your third slot and then search up silver and put the silver key in your fifth slot after this we will need uh two mods i'm pretty sure but before that we need lava lava okay and put that in your seventh slot and in your sixth slot what you want to put in is your carpet so stretch up carpet and you can choose any of them i will choose the orange one because it looks better or it looks good um and once we did this uh the rest thing the rest we need is a ladder so get some ladders and i would use the wooden ladder uh after that we will just need the two enemies and then we need the final boss but we can add that in later so let's have the enemies so we need the void right so let's put the void in there and we need a healer which is called a victory trigger and put that in our last slot now we have our hot bar filled up and we will for the final boss we will add it later so now the second thing we want to do is this might be a bit tedious but what you want to do is you want to just count the squares so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and then divide it right there one two another way to do this um is to just uh click on square right here and set it to uh width height to one and the depth to ten and now what we want to do is we want to just put it into there and then once and then after that we put a lava not lava sorry grass block like so oh wait i forgot um it fills it in so we gotta find something else i'll just replace the grass block with some brick okay there so now we just uh oops we repeat this process like so uh one two three uh how about let's repeat this let me count one two three four five six seven eight we repeat this seven times so one two three four and then keep on switching five six oh sorry six seven there once we have all seven that we're gonna use uh click on free again right here and then now go to the edge of the block so pretend this is like the first section right go to this one right here you'll actually go to this one right here and then just drag it out um i don't think the how long you drag it out matters but if you keep it even that is also great so we drag it like so there we go we just want to divide into small sections like so there we go and now we the how we make sure it's all even with each other let's just draw a line from here and make sure that all the edges are touching it like so and if they are then you know that they're even uh you don't have to do this part but what i want to do is i would just go over this one more time like so to make it like uh even with each other okay and i would usually go one more um no sorry two more to make it three blocks high so the players can't jump over it as easily but of course this is just dividing into sections so you don't have to do this a better way to do it is just to drag it all like so and there we go i'll just have it up to two because that would be a lot easier okay okay there we go once we have all our sections that we need to use uh we can start off um by getting the door but before that we need to put in our spawn point to make it a little closer okay all right let's put it in somewhere like here there okay now inside of this first section what we want is we want uh we want um a door with a key right so let's put our door in it might be sideways at first but that's okay uh place it like right there and then get our um moving tool not start not the moving tool get the rotating tool and then rotate it hold shift and rotate like so and once this door knob is facing our way you know you have it correctly and put it somewhere in the middle grab the golden key and put it in front like so i'll move the spawn point a little bit okay there we go and uh now once we did this we will go into rules right here uh and then we will add quest oh no first turn on quest add quest and let's call this door no we're just open door open door like so and then um say collect golden gold key and open the door door okay like so and once we do this we're going to leave this at auto unlock auto launch um counter type will be collected objects the tag will be gold amount is one um and send message is open like so uh open and the message will be open okay now once we did this we'll just close that up and we will go into the golden key again and we'll scroll down here we're gonna add a tag that says um golden or gold and once we did this we will go into the door and in here message required we will instead of interact we will have open so open there we go and now it should work so um we can't walk through it yet and then we grab the key oh i forgot something we need to make the key sorry we need to make the key uh into a the keys component to collectable so we can collect it there we go and collected and there you go now we can walk through the door uh as easy as that and now let's move on to the second one the second one is moving platforms so let's bring out our carpet and let's put it right somewhere in the middle there we go and once we did that we will just click on our moving tool and we will move it up a bit so we can jump on it around one block high okay and let's uh change the behavior to basic platform and now it will move side to side of course you can have it to like a y which is pretty sure how high it is right yeah so you can make it like an escalator like so the weight duration is um how long does it wait from here so it waits three seconds and it goes there wait three seconds come back down um i'll extend this to two and the platform speed is how fast it goes right now it's on nine point one i'll lower that to five and let's try this out all right so now you can see the platform is uh moving up and down you can use this as an escalator or something oops one second um if it moves up and down there's uh of course the sandbox is still in beta so it's kind of glitchy but uh it will sometimes pull you off of the platform so you gotta be careful about that uh once this thing is done i will show you an example i made an elevator kind of like this but i have some safety precautions so it wouldn't make me fall i will show you that at the end of the video so make sure to stick around but anyways that is a moving platform and let's move on to the next one so the next one is the blocks that damage slash kill you so what we want to do right now is we want to dig a hole that is two blocks deep so one two like so and then at the last at the bottom layer we fill in with lava and once we did this we should have just a trench of lava go go to global parameters go to uh controller component and then damaging blocks click add and search lava click on lava and it blocks the damage the block damage i will set this to 50 so it kind of kills fast um again if you want to like have a platformer uh then i would recommend setting us to 100 so you can kill extra fast but i said s50 for now because um i just want to show you that you can have it so that it takes like 50 damage and then 50 damage or you can have it 100 um again let me show you so here's the pillow lava i will jump in it you can see it takes with two ticks for me to die uh and yeah you can set it to 100 ticks one tick or anything you want but yeah that is how to make blocks that damage or kill you now let's move on to the next one which is displaying external nfts um right now we need a little inventory switch so click l uh drag the door out drag the key out uh we don't need the carpet anymore and then just travel over everything so put it like so move over everything now we have three uh empty slots which is perfect so we need the billboard so search a billboard and um get the billboard frame put that on slot number eight then get the uh the skeleton warrior so search up skeleton and get the skeleton warrior with the little power icon and once we did this uh we should have enough for everything we're gonna do so now let's bring in the billboard uh again there is no middle i'm pretty sure oh is there one one two three one two three four so that's the middle so we do have a middles um this one is the middle one two three four one two three four yeah right here is the middle so build a two by two right here um and then just stick the billboard on it it doesn't matter if it's crooked a little bit we'll get the rotate tool and you'll just rotate it one two like so and then the get the green access which is the what access is this it's the y rotation axis and there we go you have now created a billboard if it's glitching like this what we want to do is we just move it forward just a bit like so so now it's not too glitching or not glitching glitchy uh there we go and we can move it down just a bit okay once we have it like this what we want to do is we want to scroll down to image display right here we want to click out of it and add component nft image and now here comes a complicated part uh so not it's not too complicated but oops here so what we want to do is we want to go into google and reor your search engine and we want to do open c dot io open c dot io like so and once we did this we will click on explore right here and there's gonna be a bunch of art that we can use uh let me scroll down uh there is a bunch of art let me see what i want uh last time it was a a dog so i'll just get this pig because it looks pretty cool um yeah i'll grab this pig and what we want to do when we click into the art piece is we want to go to this share icon right here click on share click copy link right here and once it says link copied go back into the sandbox um again obs is having some problem with the sandbox but anyways once we're back in here we will go into the billboard and we'll go acid url click on that and then uh control v the url in here once you did that click validate and it will get you the image like so and now once the big images here click continue and scale mode we'll change that to fit to height and tab oh not yet tab there we go and now let's run back there and the pig should be there yay so here we have the pig with the balloon um yeah so this is how to display external nfts to use for your nft gallery uh let's move on to the next one which is uh trigger victory killing a boss let's leave that to the end because we don't want to uh have victory yet um and let's move to the next one quest setup from start to finish okay so let's have the quest so the quest is to um to have to collect all the silver keys so we're going to build a little parkour here so we have like this one there one two here one two just like so and once we did this we will just um can you make that jump i'm pretty sure you can we'll put keys on top uh shift will make it lock onto a block like so so hold shift in place and then we'll grab the selector tool and we'll just grab all of the keys and scroll down here to add components add collectible and inside of the tag we're going to put in silver like so um display name we're going to change to silver key and we leave behavior at none um then let's go back into rules add quest and rule and you will name this one uh collect the keys like so and in the description we're going to go uh grab all of the silver keys um and auto unlock we will we will put it as required message and the message is uh open so this one uh so that this one this quest will launch after we open the door or else there's just gonna be a bunch of quests that just launch in the beginning which we do not want so we will make this one after they completed the first one uh and after that we will go to quest type select as counter counter type collected objects uh the tag will be silver amount is three and auto completion is yes send message uh it's a bit glitchy as i said earlier because it's still in beta um so if if something happens like this where you can't reach the message then just try it again and it should work okay and now let's send the message as collect so add that if you don't have it then just click add collect and you should be good once we are done with this we'll close this up and we will play so please tap again so right now we only have one quest so it's just open the door click gold key and open the door click this and it'll open um another one is and as you can see that pop it just popped up grab all of the silver keys so let's grab all the silver keys like so and you can see it is going up um the silver keys getting thing is going up oh i can't seem to parkour today okay then we'll try again imagine i can't do this um there you go so once you got all three uh it will complete the quest and now let's move on to the next to last one which is to have things that damage and heal you so the victory trigger will heal you and the void will hurt you so let's build a barrier here so they can't escape um and let's put a ladder on the outside and inside so outside ladder turn it around like so now we have two ladders and we will highlight both of the ladders make sure you don't highlight anything else and add component and climb a bowl so now you can climb them and now let's grab these two and we will move them to the center uh we will now now look at the void and instead of having the behavior as void we will have it as a melee enemy so now it will hurt you and uh we will have the button oh wait no not button sorry let's go back to the void really quickly we want to add the component as health so we can actually kill it i will set this to uh to where is it five or i'll just type it in five and so that we can one shot it uh and then here the melee enemy not the melee enemy the healer will have the behavior as none and we will have the component as uh wait never mind we want the behavior as healer um so the walking speed is zero and we want the component to be we don't actually need the component because we're not going to kill this thing so if we were to tab again we should be able to go and get hurt it sounds very wrong but yeah now the ladder should be climbable hey there we go all right so now it hurts us and we kill it and this thing heals us yay there we go we can climb back out okay perfect so once we did this we're gonna go to the final boss um which is a skeleton so put it in like so and let's create a little barrier uh like the same thing we did over there okay um oh why is the like at the end not like good it's okay i'll just replace it oh oh it is good it's just transparent okay so once we did this oh no okay once we did this we're just going to highlight the skeleton we're going to put the behavior as a melee enemy we're going to put the health at 50 and we're going to click on edit logic and we will go can block attack to true this means it will it can block our hits when we want to hit it let's make the attack range a bit further so it can be more powerful um and that is it uh we can also add one more component which is victory and we will say on death uh it'll have victory so tab um now let's complete the first one which is open the door okay and then open the door the second one is to just ride this thing okay and just die from the lava then all right so once we did this we will go to the final boss i don't know why i did those three but let's go back to the final boss um so let's climb the ladders oh it made the ladders not climbable so let's make it climbable the behaviors add component climb a bowl and let's just run to the oops run to the um skeleton okay there you go oh oh it's a little glitchy but okay there we go now you can see that the skeleton can attack pretty far so if we were to try hiding the corner i think the skeleton can still reach us yeah it can still reach us definitely so it is more powerful and if we try to attack it normally um let me be down there okay if we try to attack it normally they block all our hits so what we need to do is we need to get a perfect parry like so and then after that we can do some damage to it uh okay there we go okay and then we win so that is how to do the beginner tutorials um again i will update you if i know how to do the teleporting but anyways i hope you all have a good day and that is it for today's video see you next one bye
