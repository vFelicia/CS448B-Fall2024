hello my name is jemmy and today i'm going to be showing you three simple coding um features in python but today we're going to be doing something different we're going to be using sublime text as our um as our code editor so yeah if you're interested here's a video playing hello my name is jemmy and today i'm going to be showing you um another thing in python it is called sublime which is a python code editor it helps with our coding and i'm going to show you how to use it later on and how to download it so first of all you just search up well i'm using um subline three so just search up sub line text three like this click enter then go to the first link which says download sublime click it and then here there's just a bunch of uh like information about uh the program so there's this big button which is download click it and then uh wait no no sorry in here um you have different versions of it so right now i'm using a windows but if you're using a mac just go to os right here so if you're using a windows then what you do is you press windows like this and then if it downloads in here then you click open when open after it's done so just wait until the icon comes up like this and now we click open right now just click yes and uh you could take this or not click next and install then uh just click next and yeah you should be able to click install but since i already did um since i already installed it it like yeah it just pops up like that but yeah you should be on this page and yeah that's it so that's how to download it and after that you can have like a finish and then you would have if you search up in your uh desktop right here then just click open sublime and then it should bring you to like an empty page which is like something like this and just file save as go to anywhere you want to save it and then uh pretend you want to name it like test but don't forget to add dot p y which makes it um python related or else if you just save it as like test right then for example if you print wait no since i already see it does this it can't resave it so yeah just make sure to save it as dot cubot so i'll be seeing you later bye okay so now that you're back from downloading sublime i'm pretty sure i'm going to teach you three topics as i said before the for loop the while loop and how to communicate between sublime and excel so let's see first of all why don't we talk about the for loop so let me just comment the while loop real quick okay now the for loop uh is pretty simple if you want to test out yourself you can copy the code from me first of all make a variable that is a list and after that you're going to say for i i can be your change to anything really like for example um a e i o u anything short and simple after that you're going to say in range 1 to 11 1 to 11 is actually one two three four five six seven eight ten so if you want your end number to be ten then it should be eleven so basically the n number needs to be plus one so if you want your n number to be eleven it's twelve good idea okay now after that put a colon after the um this command right here and then you're going to say menu dot append and then parentheses i this is to add i into the menu list okay and then you can't see the results if you don't print it so click i mean right print menu now after you're done let's test out the result by clicking control b which is build it shows down here as you can see one two three four five six seven nine ten oh it's all lined up but if you want it to be 11 then you change it to 12 and click control b again so now we see that change from 10 to 11 perfect so that is the for loop pretty simple right moving on to the while loop okay the while loop is kind of like the for loop really what you do is you make a variable okay and set that variable to one right now and then after that you say while count which is the variable's name um is less or equal to 10 with this going to be repeating um until count is equal to 10. why no i mean until count count is greater than 10 then uh if it's still less or equal to then we're going to print account and then we're going to add one to count which is to increase it every time so it should be one uh nine one two three four five two given a ten just like for loop but instead of being in the list like this it's going to be straight down in a column so let's test this out ctrl b there you go one two three four five six seven nine ten now unlike the for loop the um while loop it doesn't the end number right here doesn't need to be one greater than so if you want to be 11 it's straight up 11 so yeah you don't have to complicate yourself here we are 11. okay perfect so those are the two loops i was going to show you for today now i'm going to show you how to communicate between xl and sublime which is i mean hyphen in sublime which is kind of which is actually like decently interesting to me um in here as you can see article equal to open um this one is actually i have to show you something else first real quick and here you're going to create a thing called article dot txt not dot py um and then just grab a random text in oh i grabbed one about coronavirus above the pandemic and um how americans drugs um they inventing it and yeah so grab a random thing and you could be one word two words three words a whole paragraph a whole story doesn't matter so grab it in and um now we create another program called uh well it should be called excel dot py but for some reason i named it auto translate i don't know why okay after that uh you do article equal to open article.txt um comma and then uh quotation marks are which is to open this guy right here this tab um and after they open that we're going to say article equal to article.read which is to grab all this information in here and put it into this variable okay after we're done with that command then we're going to do article equal to article.split this is split each um each word into a different like section so yeah it's not split is to split like the into one word which is actually already so it's basically splitting the whole entire paragraph into like each word okay get what i mean okay after that we're going to print count um and then so this is this uh command is to print how much words are inside the article so len is the range of it and print count and then we say like 48 49 100 etc okay after you're done with that this one you might need to for these you might need to like go into command prompt and do pip install open pi excel which is to insert like how do you call it um an extension really to for you to communicate with excel so after you're done with that uh you do from open high excel import workbook which is a code that they have in um openpixel and then these two are also some commands that you would need so yeah just copy these two down workbook equal to workbook parentheses sheet equal to workbook dot active yeah copy them down and then cheat dot append as we saw on in the for loop yeah append is to add to um something so this in this case we're going to add to excel so we're going to add article which right here is the each single words and we're going to add that after that we're going to save the um excel file as whatever you want and then dot xlsx so pretend like food dot xlsx remember to have this at the end because this is like the how you call it the last name of the file yeah so once you're done with this let's test it out real okay so we're going to rename this because since i already tested this to make sure it works i'm going to have to rename it so it doesn't um save on top of each other uh so how do i um dog okay let me just do coronavirus because it's uh what the topic is chrono virus okay so brilliant now let's control b for control build and there's 40 to 43 words in this article and it finished in 0.5 seconds so now if you go into your um into the files that you have then it should be there so mines is uh where is it okay here and boom and here we are where is it well this is the hello world i tested so it needs to be here coronavirus there we go and you can see that it splits into it splits each word into its own column and yeah that's how to communicate between excel and python in sublime so see you later bye
