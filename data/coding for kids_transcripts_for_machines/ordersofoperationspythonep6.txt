hello everyone and uh welcome back to python ep 6. um and today i'm going to be showing you orders of operations which is um ranking the math equations so like rank number one there is the parentheses ranked number two is exponents number three is multiplication and division and number four is addition subtraction now you're probably wondering multiplication and division are the same level then how can we distinguish which one comes first or last so how did this doing distinguish this is that um whoever comes first so like pretend this is an equation four times let me see four times three divided by one this is totally random okay um the four times three gonna come first because it's going to be um the first equation that comes up however if it was like this then 1 divided by 4 would be first because the equation comes before times three okay however if um for addition subtraction if it were to do that two one the subtract by four and then plus three then uh subtraction would come first addition would come last and if you were to switch it around like this um like so then addition would come first so yeah it's pretty simple it's not that hard uh i think you guys can do it and yeah let's get right into it so as i was saying guys um x should equal to let's do parentheses three minus one and then plus two then print well this isn't really gonna work is it so what if we do times two x here we go four so um however if we put out the parentheses it wouldn't equal four anymore one so you guys so parentheses matter because if we put parentheses in here then it would mean for three subtracted by one to be done first before um it times two so yeah that's how to do parentheses it's pretty easy but if we had no parentheses then it would do one times two first instead of three subtracted by one so yeah that's the um ranking of orders of operation it applies to every single math equation so in python and normal math uh i think in every programming language uh so yeah you guys should keep in mind with this because if you do something wrong and your equation turns out the wrong answer then your program would go into jeopardy jeopardy because um it's going to like not work because the equation is wrong so yeah keep in mind also operation um it's going to be very useful later so yeah just keep in mind about that and um yeah so let me just show you another equation it's uh pretty simple i have a let's do exponents okay we put parentheses in three subtract by one and then exponented so exponent is two multiplication two times by two so it's going to be i predict it's four okay as you can see it's four but if we take out this then it's two because one exponent by two is one and then subtracted by three is two but if we do a parenthesis first like this then um three subtracted by one would become first so it would be two and then two um um by the power of two would be two times two which would equal to four so yeah that's the power of orders of operation and the power of parentheses because if you want an equation to come first just put the parentheses around it what if we do something like this what do you think will come first okay it's gonna be um so three x by the power of one would equal three and then by the power of two would equal nine okay so um it would equal nine because it will do this first which would equal um three as i said before but however if they do this first which we could by putting parentheses around it then would totally change it up because this would now equal one um by the power of two would equal to one and then three by the power of one equals to one so it's not nine anymore not nine anymore so let me just try it as you can see it's three but if we take this out then it should be nine what three exponent by one equals three and then three by the power of two is nine or am i missing something here hold up let me just go grab a calculator is it though okay let me just um three you know what it's okay let me just try to figure it out so why does it do this print it equals to three three by the power of one am i missing something here three by the power of one what is the power three right yes then three exponent by two it's still three that shouldn't what okay who cares let me just try explaining this in front maybe that will help this is so weird it's first come first serve to the right now it's nine for some reason huh no if you oh you can't oh that's why you never see any equation with like two exponents behind them because you can't so you need a parenthesis and then you would exponent oh i get it now okay so you need a parenthesis if you're going to exponent um a number by two times then you need parentheses around the first equation and then you put the um times uh by the power of two at the end which would make it um the number that you want it to be if you don't put the parentheses however if this section behind it won't work so remember to put the parentheses you're going to use exponents okay so yeah that's it for this video i hope you found something useful i certainly did because i didn't know that this even exists in the first place so i must have done something wrong in the past so yeah bye see you next video
