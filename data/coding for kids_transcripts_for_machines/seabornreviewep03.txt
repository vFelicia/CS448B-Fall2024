hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i am going to be giving you a brief overview on seabourn and today just a special announcement is that i have a new camera um and hopefully it records my face better my last one was my webcam on my laptop and it wasn't as good as this one this one's like a camera so yeah hopefully the quality is better and my face isn't that gray anymore so let's begin so first let's open command prompt or cmd and then um if you don't have seaborne yet then make sure to pip install cbone first because that is a library we're going to be using today once you did that um if you already have it it will come up requirement already satisfied but if you don't then it should be installing packages right now and once you're done with installing seaborn make sure to pip install matplotlib also because that's also another library we're going to be using once you have pip installed both of these then what we want to do is you want to type in jupyter notebook like so we should open our jupyter notebook into a browser like this and um since i already prepared my notebook uh i will go into my file but if you don't then just click new python 3 ipy kernel and then this will create a new notebook for you to use now your notebook shouldn't look too much like mine since i already wrote code in it but what you want to do first is you want to rename your notebook to something according to this lesson such as basic seaborn ep3 now once we're done with this the first thing we're going to be doing is we're going to import our libraries we're going to be using which is cborn as sns and import matplotlib.pi plot as plt these import ads will basically shorten down the name of these libraries so whenever we want to use them we don't have to type out their whole name we just need to type out sns and plt after that make sure to have percent sign matplotlib inline this will basically allow us to show graphs and be able to visualize your data this code is used to display all of the possible data sets we can be using seaborne has already premade data sets for us to use so this will display what there are sorry i forgot to p um import okay we need to wait until it connects to our notebook really quick and there we go so there is a bunch of them that we're gonna that we could use but i will use the penguins one since it is the one that is the most fun for me and the one is that is most usable um so yeah that's why i'm going to be using the penguins one today also once we did that we got to store the penguin dataset inside a variable so i made a variable called pens and with the code sns.loaddataset penguins i am able to restore all the information into the variable and now this is what the first five rows of the variable looks like inside of each row there's going to be one two three four five six seven there are seven columns the first column is the species there's three species in total the deli the shin strap and the gen two and the island i don't know about the island but um it just tells you where the penguins live and then there is the bill length the build depth the flipper length and the body mass the build length is how long the bill is or the mouth and the build depth is how deep it is or the deepness of the mouth and the flipper length is how long the foot are and the body mass is how heavy the penguin is and the gender is what um are they either boy or girl or male or female and um in here we're going to be looking at lm plot lm plot is a way to visualize your data it's a plot and um it looks somewhat like this so we can see a bunch of blue dots and a line this line is called the regression line or the average and all the dots are resembling the bill length and the build depth i forgot to go over this code but basically what it is is it sets the xaxis and then the yaxis do something else and it sets what data we're going to be using in this case we're going to be using our pen data set or our penguin data set however we can't really tell which one is what right so with the command sns.lm plot x equals build length y equals build length i mean x equals build depth y equals spell length data equals to pen palette equals cool warm and hue equals the species we are able to um have more detail in what it is so here is a legion on the side and the blue resembles the deli so we can see the deli over here the chin strap is the white and gentoo is orange and you can customize it to look somewhat like this or make it more detailed you can also change the color using the command palette to cool and warm and the hue to species which makes it differentiate between each species you can even go further but i will be only showing you that today since there is already a lot of good tutorials on customizing lm plots let's move on to the next one which is comparing grids um this basically will create multiple of these grids but in uh you might have noticed over here they're all cramped into one grid but we're gonna divide through all three of them into a three individual grid so what we're gonna do is we're going to have uh at the end call which stands for columns equals to species this will uh create three grids for each one as you can see all of them are divided there's the deli mission strap and the gen 2. let's move on to the style so we're going to be moving on from lm plot and now we're going to be using the count plot the count plot is a bit different since you only need to set the x coordinate not the y and the y coordinate is the count so let's see what it does and you can see here since we set our x coordinates to be species there's a deletion strap and gentoo and the count is how much penguins there are so the deli has 145 around penguins the shin strap has 60 around ish and the gen 2 has around 120 penguins and that is the count plot uh we can also set the background for the account plot such as the dark grid the dark grid um basically sets the background for us and make it more uh customizable so we can see here that there is a grayish darkish background um we can also see an assortment of backgrounds so if we were to do shift tab we can look in here and we can click plus and then scroll down to here now there is a list of commands or styles we can use right now i will be using the white one since i will show you some something in down this code that requires the white one so if we set it to white it would look something somewhat like the original um and if you don't want these two borders right here then you can do sns count plot x equals the species data equals to pen sns.dspine this will remove these two lines right here so now those two are removed if you want to remove both of these what you want to do is left which is the yaxis and the bottom is the xaxis so pretend you only want to remove the yaxis then you make bottom equals to false or you don't even have the code like this and now the bottom one is not removed however if you want to remove both of them then you can do left equal to true and bottom equals to true now all the lines are removed we can also change the size of our plot and if i want to be bigger then i will make it 15 by 5 and this will make our uh our plot considerably bigger like so and if we only want the font to get bigger and not the actual plot then we can just do font scale equals to 1.2 now you can see that the plot or the plot the graphs are the same but just the font has been increased so we can play around with the settings but that is it and all i have for you today i hope you enjoyed this video see you the next one bye
