hi guys my name is jimmy and welcome back to python ep8 today i'm going to be talking about ifs so i'm going to show you how to use ifs in python i've been waiting to learn this for a long time because um you get to actually uh like experience like with two conditions so yeah i'm let's get started first of all let's name a project the functions of if okay and um now let's start with an input actually so let's pretend we're going to um make a program that says uh like if are you old enough to use this program so let's try saying like um here we are and input let's just say set age equal to let's set this to in right away because we're going to use it for our if so int then inside another one upside and input now we're going inside and now we're going to say enter enter your age here now with a little little bit of manipulating we can um use it to get the real age uh so right here we're going to do enter your real age here so it's not really manipulative but yeah they'll they'll think that um that it doesn't really matter what the age is so they'll enter the real age and if they're too young then they're going to um not be qualified so yeah uh that's it and once we're done with the input right now we're going to um and now we're going to do if so here's if if we're going to use a little bit of a weird method it's pretty simple hang tight so if age is greater or equal to 10 then enter and then colon this one enter and then we say qualify like this and then enter again delete this and we're going to say program and do and i forgot i just will end it there we go program ended and we're going to say like that so wait do you don't need to put um wait let me i think you need to print right or don't you i think you do need a print though okay print okay so here we are program ended missing call print program oh okay i have something like this right yeah or there's still some text there you go and then now we're going to say 10 how about let's try yeah tent file that name or qualified is not defined oh and you gotta print it i forgot it print boom so now after that i guess we can do it now okay enter your name page here that qualify and program ended there you go it's pretty simple and let's try something else about eight years old eight enter program ended see there wasn't any qualified so yeah you can use this in multiple ways so let's see um uh let's say coins so pretend you want to like see how much coins they have and if they can like um exchange it for item or something then uh enter your it uses the same concept but you can use it multiple ways so enter the amount of coins here okay um pretend it's in roblox and you need to get the dominus how much is the dominance i'm not sure so let's get uh this much like let's coins the dominus is the most expensive item i'm pretty sure in roblox so yeah let me just 2 000 like 200 200 20 000 okay yeah 20 000 coins in order to um exchange it so yeah here and then what you need to do is you run it now actually let's change qualified to exchange okay here enter the amount of coins here so pretend it's what uh and then program ended it doesn't give you it but however if you do twenty thousand and one then it says exchange there we go it's pretty interesting you guys can use it on for like a lot of things actually and um yeah so i hope you enjoyed this video in the next video we're going to be talking about um something else it's similar to this it's called if else and yeah i'm going to see in the next video bye welcome back to coding for kids python ep9 today i'm going to be showing you if else because last video i showed you how to do if it's pretty simple and not now you can actually do um a lot of more things with if else there's also the this command called alif which is combined with um if and else so it's basically combined it and i'm going to show you how to use all those code so first of all let's start up with a variable as we did before age um let's put input first so hashtag functions of if else okay so now let's put age equals to in um slash input and then here we do uh quotation marks and we say uh enter your age here there we go and then call in here like that enter your age here and in here what we do is we are going to say like if age if age is is less is uh less less than less or equal to 10 then colon what we do is we print um child like this so we're gonna classify them under age so child and now we're gonna do a lift which is between uh if and else so alif age is um greater age is greater no no it's just less then let's say 20 less or equal to 20 then what we print is you print teenager let's just test that first t nature there let's just test that okay 16 teenager there we go and now if we do like this and we do four years old child there we go it's pretty simple guys um you can use this and let me just show you the rest until it's grandpa so here and then we do uh is less is less or equal to how much 50 and then we're going to say that this is prime prime years right prime years prime of life yeah prime of life there you go which means that they're in like their top like they can achieve a lot in this um time okay and this last one is just going to be else because um for the last one just do else like this else age is this then do 90 then retired retired there we go so now if you want to just go to ask your what else age oh huh enter your age what's wrong or do i or we could just do a live it doesn't really matter guys so just do a lift if you want um yeah let's see there we go enter your age so let's try all of them sixth child play again uh eleven is less than 10. what enter your age here value input 10 11 see okay let's just try again then so how about we try 10 child but 11 so let's just set this to 11 let's do 21 no no wonder it um does that for every single one okay there we go here we are and enter your age here let's try 11 again child good now um let's try 18. oh sorry we have to click play again so let's try 18 boom teenager nice uh how about 45. i keep on printing over there 20 45 45 is prime of life and um how about 67. retired so there we go guys it's a pretty simple program that you can use um for ranking and for me i could i use this for like a bunch of different things like i have ideas like pretend as we send um last video like uh the dominus okay it it ranks like how much money if you can like buy or not so now we're gonna check uh if you're um your skill okay pretend there's a hundred to a hundred skill uh we're going to enter so pretend you made a game right and enter your skill points here there and then after this we can say like if age which actually should change this if skill um and then just change out this skill skill and then so on like this okay once it's like that then um you can like change it to like noob um enter me do it and then uh advanced and pro there we go like this so you can use it for your age for all other sorts of things so like every 10 9 new um here so 21 let's try 18 intermediate uh 43 advanced and lately 88. pro there we go so that's easy way to use if else in a lift so yeah i hope you enjoyed this video um i hope you found something useful see you next episode see ya bye
