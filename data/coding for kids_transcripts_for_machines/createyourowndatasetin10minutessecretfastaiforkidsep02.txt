hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be giving you the second episode of fast ai for kids in this video we're going to be showing you how you can do image scrapping from python so this is so um we can grab our images that we're going to use to create our ai such as for cats or dogs um and we're gonna create our own data set and i'll show you how so first off let's open uh any browser you would like i'm gonna open opera gx because uh it's a pretty good uh browser and then after you opened it what you should do is you should go into uh google collapse just search up google photo lab like this um and just press enter then go into the first one click on that and it should you to bring you to this page um if you haven't did if you haven't done anything yet then it shouldn't uh come up like mine but if you did then uh there should be stuff in here uh ignore all this and create new notebook and it should uh load up into a new page there you go so this is the new page that we have right now um and you can see we can adjust the name and we have one line of code so at first we're gonna adjust the name to uh image scrapping wrapping from python i'll just do image graphing ep02 like so and i will go into this great website i'll drag onto the screen uh this is i'll leave this link to into the description by the way it is the jmd image scrapper that we're going to be using um i'll also leave the link to the finished collab file in the description so it would be already done so if you don't want to like follow uh if you want to type the code out we just use that lab file it's the finished product and we're today we're going to be using the jmd image scrapper to create our own image scrapping so first off we can copy this in here uh this the pip install jmd image scrapper so we can copy and paste that this is so that we can just install the image scrapper into our collab workspace and in order to do that we need to uh put an exclamation point in front and let's connect first so once we do that we have to make sure our hardware accelerator is gpu which is the best way to run an ai then click connect over here and then we have to wait until it's done connecting all right once it shows up like this ram and disk uh what you want to do is go ahead and click uh play or right i don't know what that thing is called run um and you will see a long line of code like this uh don't be surprised it will just uh installed for you if it says requirement already satisfied that means you already installed it into the your collab workspace so you don't have to do it anymore and now we're going to create a new one so we can just press uh plus code over here and for our second code we're going to be using uh these two lines right here these two so copy this and go into here and just paste uh this one is so that we can use uh we'll install like all the like all the functions of this image scrapper into our workspace so just press run and then it should come up a check mark and for our next one we're going to be using this one we're going to be setting a route so basically uh where it's going to be saved ads at sorry and we're going to create new code and we're going to put it in there um so this is path root equals to path and then this is cwd stands for current working directory slash images so it's going to create a folder that says slash images to store our data set in um so we can go ahead and press run to you can also do shift enter which will not only run it but we'll create a new code cell for you too i would i need to get into the practice of doing this again um because it's not it's not only more useful it's also more quick and efficient so i recommend just doing shift enter let's go back into our jmd image scrapper and we're going to grab this code right here duckduckgo search route and we're going to paste in here go search root and comma cat cute kittens mac result equals 20. i'll explain to you what it does so basically in here duckduckgo underscore search uh we're going to be searching in duckduckgo since it's going to give us the best results out of all the browsers uh we'll search up cute kittens in our uh like like this cute kittens like so and then press enter but instead we're gonna let um the machine do it this time and it will save into a folder called cats at roots and then we have 20 as the how much it will download for us so it will download 20 and what we want to do is we want to press run and let it load for a bit and there you go now once it hasn't once it came up in here uh if we check in here you can see there's a folder that says images um if we put it down we can see cast which is our folder that we created and if we scroll even more down there's a bunch of images or jpgs that we have downloaded if you right click on them or not right click double click it will show you a bunch of cats cute kittens to be exact um and you can change this to whatever you would like uh and it will come up like these results pretty good uh and it scraps 20 images in total you can change this to be like 100 or a thousand um it doesn't it just uh depends on how much uh data or how much variety your topic has like for cute kittens there's gonna be a lot a very wide amount of data and pictures that you can download but maybe for something like chocolate vanilla cake orange on the side there might be like not that much uh images that you can download um so it might get you some uh spam download and what you can do with that is we can clean it manually and we can actually use a handy dandy function from here uh which is right here these two codes um we can copy them uh and we're gonna go paste them in our new line i'm gonna close this uh like so close tab close all tabs there you go and i'll close this one for now now i'm gonna create a new line of code and we're going to paste these two into it um this is just going to get these two lines of code are just going to clean our data set for us so if we were to press run then it would come with a little panel for us to use you can see that these are all our images that we got um and then you can see there's page one out of three you can click next and it will bring up to the second page the next the third page like so and we can use different folders inside of the big older images um so if we were to go back up here and we're like okay let's find dogs now so we create order called dogs uh with the thing called uh cute puppies like so and then we will click run it will download all the images of your puppies and if we were to press run on this thing again uh it will come up cat still but what we can do is we can actually go to uh the folders and we can select dogs and it will come up the dog images so these are the cute puppies that we have um and cats now we have two folders uh with cats we can check if any of them are like not what we want maybe it's like multiple cats and we only want a singular cat um so we can click delete under here and it'll just cross out this image or we'll delete it and we go to the next one and then we find any cats that we don't want you can see there's two cats here we can delete that next one and you can see we can keep on doing this for dogs and cats and the more you have the more harder it is to clean because then you have to scroll through more and more images and data sets so yeah good luck with that i had to do that it was pretty painful um but it's what you do to get a clean data set and make your ai the best uh to its uh to be great the best to its ability okay and you can also do the same thing for dogs you go through dogs you see oh multiple dogs bye bye they're really cute but they're too much dogs in one picture they might get confused like it's threeheaded dog um and then we can go to the last page and two dogs delete and there you go that's how you clean your data set and there you go that's how you clean your data set and for our uh last code last line of code we're going to be doing a code that allows us to um like download our data set into our computer so in order to do that we need this line of code right here uh zip with an exclamation point in front slash r content images for from collab.zip so this just saves it for us and from what a path with content images so that would be this is in the content folders and images and it will save us this thing so yeah we can press play right here or run and you can see it's like oh i'm gonna save and if we were to close this out and open it again uh if we put this a little bit you can see it saves as images from collab which is the name we set right here um dot zip and you can just click right and we can click download and it'll just go into our local computer uh you can see it comes up download complete and yeah that's how you download your data set and that's how you clean it um if we were to go check it out let's go see let me drag it in so images from collab there's the content branch and then there's images and then there's those two folders cats and dogs so if we look in cats there's all the images that we want the little cute kitties um singular kitties um so we can just check on the images and you can check for dogs too and then yeah that's how to get a data set and obviously you can increase this you have more like a thousand or something i hope this helped you and i remember that i will leave these two links from this jmd image scrapper right here and the finished collab file this one in the description so make sure to check that out and yeah thank you for watching this video and see you next time bye
