hello everybody my name is Jamie and today I will be doing part two of the Python bot series and in this video we're going to be covering a little bit more basics of python and we're going to look at you know the basics of uh building a bot so we could go do it a little bit easier with knowing like the foundation the basics so yeah let's start without further ado so first things first we're going to open vs code if you don't know how to install visual studios in my last previous video there is a video showing you how to do it but if you already have a download that's fine uh just press Visual Studio codes open it up you take from this screen if you're wondering what's on my right side again it's my uh the things I want to touch on for this lesson uh we have one two three four we have in total four parts that I want to touch on today but these parts are very important so we have to pay attention uh so first things first let me come into here we're going to press on new file and we're going to choose python file if you don't if this doesn't show up that means your extensions hasn't been installed yet so go back to the previous video install everything first so we're going to choose python file which makes it the dot py and B and we can save it somewhere I'm gonna save it to my folder here videos part two all right so the first thing we're going to be learning is about dictionaries in the last video where I showed you guys arrays or a list and now we're going to be doing dictionaries dictionary is kind of like how you would view in real life there's going to be a key and there's going to be a value um the key is basically like the word and the value is the definition I'll show you what it means so in order to create a dictionary first actually let's do this first so dictionary part nine because last video is part eight dictionary so in order to create a dictionary we first have to have a name my name will be my stats like you know maybe stats in game we have to know what they're at right now so my stats equal to and then uh these little like I don't know how they call it the Powershell kind of colon well I don't know what to call it let me search it up um what's that called it is called uh uh comma no parentheses bracket angle bracket what I can't find anything about it what is that called eh let me they call it Crow bracket curly brackets all right it's called a curly bracket so we have to have two curly brackets to declare a variable press enter I mean uh dictionary press enter and you can see it spaces out for us nice and neat so let's start off with declaring some uh keys inside of this dictionary our first key is going to be a string called uh let's say health because that's pretty important right health and we're gonna have a cold in here to Define what health is and we're going to say health is that's a hundred that's full health right so health is 100 comma this is to separate each word in definition or key in values Health next we're gonna have Mana because that's important right Mana let's say we used up a little bit let's say 75 next one we're gonna have what is say hunger Hunger hunger is about maybe 160 and then we have water levels or just water and I guess you're pretty good on water we have like 80 or something all right so that's our stats for our uh stats for here oh wait I almost forgot one thing this is a bit complicated but we're gonna have uh maybe we're gonna have like some Pokemons inside of our stats statistics you know keep track of what Pokemons we have right now so we're going to create a list inside of this dictionary called Pokemon so in order to do that we're going to do another string Pokemon this is going to be a bit different from declaring a normal list but because we're doing it inside of a dictionary so we're gonna have Pokemon as a string and then we're gonna do uh the this thing like the square brackets and remember to put a comma every time you separate all right and then inside of Pokemons we're going to have three Pokemons obviously we're gonna have Pikachu because who doesn't want Pikachu in their Pokemon or let's say Pokedex actually Pokedex yeah inside of your Pokemon sounds weird inside their Pokedex Pikachu Raichu maybe let's just do Pikachu Evolution Raichu let's put Petri in front oops YouTube perfect so we have our Pokedex right here which is consists of Pichu Pikachu and Raichu so yeah that's our statistics right now and let's see what we can do with this dictionary so first things first we're obviously kind of print it right because that's what everybody does um right yeah hopefully it's not just me but I just want to print it and see what it looks like first so let's play and there you go it has Health Mana hunger water Pokedex and then we have our Pokemon okay so once we have printed it out you know there's nothing special about it there's nothing like too crazy now what if we decide to you know want to only look at Health how do we do it you have to have the key name in here so we're gonna do uh bracket and then there are key names to help like so and as you can see it prints out the value of Health which is 100 if we try to do for Mana 75 and then so on and so on let's try Pokey that Pokedex let's see what happens up there oh Pokemon X all right it's gonna be Pichu Pikachu and Raichu so yeah that's basically it however what if we want the first Pokemon instead of our Pokedex inside of our statistics let's see so in order to do that we're gonna have to print out the list name first and then outside of these brackets outside the first brackets we're gonna add another one and we're gonna choose which one we want remember a list always starts from zero a list or an array so zero one two right so we're going to start with zero let's see but bam Pichu right there so we took one specific one out all right that's pretty good and what if we just don't want the values what if we just want to see our statistics you know maybe like we want to see what we have what our criteria is what to stay alive or whatever uh we could do that as well let's comment this out all right so we can do that by saying print print my stat dot uh let's pretend we want the definition or like the stats so dot Keys like this dot keys with parentheses let's play it out there you go it gives a list of our dictionary Keys Health Mana hunger water and Pokedex we could do the same thing for values as well values laid out as you can see 175 60 80 and then our list so yeah that's basically it for dictionaries uh of course you can add remove pop uh you know I'll do all those stuff you want to do with an array you can do the dictionary as well but it's not as important right now so yeah let's move on to the next one and if you don't know how to comma if you don't know how to comment like bulk like this just do control and slash it's really easy it's like new hack I just learned um so yeah uh after this let's go to Part 10 so part 10 let me zoom in just in case okay part 10 is going to be about while Loops uh so while Loops are pretty interesting because they go on until it's over um so let's create an example let's pretend we got injured right now our health is down so let's say we have a variable called health health equals to we're like Adriana so probably for 10 15 that's pretty low 15 healthy goes to 15. we're gonna do while health else else equals or is less less or equal to wait yeah less or equal to they're just less than a hundred uh then whatever we wanted to do we wanted to heal right so we're gonna do else plus equal to plus equal to basically means or equal to plus I don't know equal to plus like this well one of these ways probably this one um it's going to basically say Alice will add on top of itself how much we want so we're gonna say maybe by 10 all right so we're gonna add every time it Loops we're gonna add ten we're also going to print out health print Health every time so we can see that like the progress going up and once it's over we just stop so yeah uh let's actually import time as well import time and for time time is already built in just uh let that be we're gonna do time dot sleep uh we're gonna set this as like 0.2 maybe so every time it has a little delay uh let's see there you go 25 35 40 55 65 at blah blah until 105. so when it reaches 105 it overheels but you know can't hurt you have extra more Health right so yeah that's basically our while our while loop and uh yeah that's basically it so that's how to use while loops you can even make this a little bit more complicated if you want and I'll show you how to do that later so let's control slash this all right let's move on to our part 11 wait hashtag hashtag part 11. which is going to be four Loops so for Loops four Loops is another loop that we use a lot in you know this program so uh pretend let's say uh maybe we want them to list out our Pokemons in our Pokedex so let's go back up here grab our Pokedex really quickly we might need to edit this a little bit because we have to make it an array now so Pokedex equals to there all right so now we have an array called Pokedex with our Pokemons inside and we're gonna say four I in range like so uh we actually no no let's say let's say four values in Pokedex like so and then we're gonna have a golden here enter try it out oh there you go so instead of print Pokedex I originally print I because we're gonna have pull connection here so yeah that's basically it okay let's move on to part 12. heart wealth is about functions um and basically like what a function is when you have a set of code that you can call up multiple times instead of having the entire thing you can have like uh you can have it group and you can just call it like pretend walking would be a function right so we don't have to say right foot forward left foot forward right foot forward left foot forward we just say walk and it'll just do it for us so yeah let's learn how to define a function first so in order to Define function we have def for Define and then we're gonna have our function name uh I'm gonna grab our healing right here so we might use this Ctrl C Ctrl V let me delete this stuff all right so we're gonna have our function as Define heal and inside of heel this is a local variable it's basically going to uh when we call the functions we need these like things inside of the function so we're going to have one that says uh equipment equipment or part I guess and then this is basically what we're going to heal and our other one is going to be Health current health okay so we have two local variables here we're going to press a colon enter all right while we have in here we're going to grab all of our this of our heel put that inside all right time dot sleep uh maybe we can delete this we don't need this or we could leave it as if if we want to we could just say import time here oh now let's just let's just delete it it's fine all right so once you have something like this we should be AOkay so let's try calling up a function really quickly so we're going to call up heal heal equipment we're gonna say sword if you're a sword God damage uh let's say our sword is that like 20 right now 20 Health let's say as you can see it heals our sword oh I forgot one important thing instead of printing Health let's do print equipment uh equip oh sorry equipment comma uh comma we're gonna say colon comma and when I say health this way it looks more natural instead of just this let's compare them you can see sword is at this much sword 30 sword 64 70 sword 80 90 100. so yeah that's basically it for heal and now let's move on to part or uh 13. part 13. part 13 is calling functions you might be wondering hey what's the point of calling a function but then we just call one we did but we're gonna call from another file calling function from another file so this way we can have multiple functions not in one file because that's a bit uh redundant if you ask me so yeah let's create a new follower here new uh we can do new text file and we're going to control s we're going to go to our python bot or wherever you store it we're going to rename this to function yield dot g y like so then we're going to copy and paste this entire thing or just this part paste into here and run it and save it alright once you've done this we have a function here.py ready to go and let's calm this out oh it's not bad controlled like that all right and just to make sure it doesn't work anymore we're going to do we're gonna copy this and we're gonna paste in here so make sure that the function is out right as you can see it's gonna say undefined healer is not defined as you can see uh so it doesn't work anymore but in order for it to work we can do it really simply just do import enter file name functionhill.py so let's do function uh from wait wait no from function eel Dot py or yeah py import uh import heal like so we're gonna press play no module named function here.py all right well what if we try from file heal function heal there you go so it has you can't have dot py after it just do stop wrong function heal import heal as you can see it'll do this uh let's pretend we have multiple multiple uh we call it multiple functions inside of this file so let's say attack so instead of plus it's going to subtract from Health until if health is less is less or is greater than zero we're going to subtract until it's more than zero so we're gonna try it out all right so let's instead of heal and then in order to you know do this we instead of only saying import heal we're going to import uh the star which basically says import every single function so once we do this we can grab this control C control V enemy let's say their health is like really much like uh maybe 700 would spit too much maybe like 150. okay let's see this a bam this oh what oh wait did we didn't save it or something okay let's save this all right oh we did heal no wonder attack all right play as you can see our sword heals up while our enemy decreased from 148 to zero so yeah that's how to call functions from another file and that's basically for this video I hope you enjoyed see you in the next one bye
