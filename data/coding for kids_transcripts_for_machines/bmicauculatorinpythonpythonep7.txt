hi guys my name is jemmy and today i'm going to be showing you um how to calculate your bmi which is how fat you are um so the way to calculate it is actually pretty simple let us name our subject first bmi um and then how to calculate it is to have your weight that is in kilogram form oh and then divided by your height which your height which is in your um which is in meter form times your height so it's gonna look something like this uh at the end so basically what you do is get your um high times height and then divide it by your weight and then it's your bmi so yeah let's get right into it and we're going to put inputs into this so that they can enter their own weight and height so um let's get started so the first process is to get the input in okay so there's going to be input and we're going to ask them to enter your way here like this and after that um what you do is you go wait no and then you put enter your weight as a kilogram form right here enter your weight here and then something like that then they're going to enter their weight and how about let's just put this as a variable as h no h is for height for w okay and um since we're going to put this along with uh an integer we need to um change this to an integer 2. so what you should do is get another parenthesis around this input and outside you put int and behind this you put another parenthesis like this and then now you convert this into integer not it's not a string anymore it's now an integer so yeah after that let's get your height height equals to integer same thing input and then um another parenthesis enter enter your height here and then remember to put um height as meter so that we know like centimeter or meter actually you know what however let's just do centimeter because then we can still convert it so enter your centimeter of the height here and there we go um that's how they'll enter their height and weight okay after that what you do is you get your um you get your height to convert into a centimeter so i mean can um convert your height from a centimeter to a meter so how would you do that is h equals to um h divided by a hundred which means that right here you can see uh h is equal to their centimeter of their height and then h divided by um h is going to equal to h divided by 100 which would equal to the meter so centimeter divided by 100 equals the meter there we go after that um we're going to get the bmi so b bmi equals to bmi equals to the width which is the weight um weight and then divided by height times where's times here times height and as you can see uh we want high times height first and then weight right but then if we go like this it's going to be a weight divided by height then times height so you won't want that so in order to do that we need to put parentheses as i said earlier orders of operations here we are uh and after this is the output so we print print the b bmi which um whoops print bmi there you go now it gets your bmi so let's pretend um 60 right uh 60 155 and this would be your bmi it's pretty simple guys it's a short video how long is it just four minutes four or five minutes so it's not that much it's pretty simple it's like i'm not sure what a bmi is used for let me just switch it up how about that um okay b what do you need uh what do you why do you need bmi why do you need bmi or what is bmi your bmi is a measurement that is a that is a ratio of your weight and height it's a good way to gauge whether your weight is in a healthy proportion to your health in fact knowing your bmi can help you and your gp determine any health risk so it's for your health basically guys um if you know your bmi you rather know you're fat you're skinny or you're good as you can see is in healthy proportion to your height so whether you're healthy or not and any like um risks you might have so look another question what is a bad bmi if your bmi is under 80 18.5 k um kilograms you are considered underweight and possibly malnourished which means that you aren't um fed well enough and this one 18.5 to 24.9 kilograms you're within healthy weight of range for your for young and in middle and the 25 to 29 kilograms you're considered overweight okay so yeah uh that's bmi so now since we know what it's used for um i think we can like use that for a bunch of other stuff so if you want to like see whether your health in good shape or um and you fatten up or like go on a diet then you just calculate your bmi and then uh look in this website or something and then you'll see whether you're in good shape or you're a little overweight so yeah see you next video of python bye for now
