hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be giving you a brief overview on uh sandbox game maker a very exciting game maker and it's very fun you can do a lot of things with it and i'll show you how to work with it but first let's know what sandbox is sandbox is a basically a game that is located inside of the metaverse it's like a multiplayer game you can play with other people but instead of being any regular game you can actually buy land you can do stuff with your land um like make a business or something and you can exchange coins which is sand it's called can the currency is sand like ours would be bought or dollars but in the game it's called sand um there are three main components of sandbox of course there is the voxel edit which will let you design 3d models there is the marketplace which allows you to sell stuff and um get stuff and there is the game editor which is what i'm doing right now if you want to know more about the um the voxel edit then go check out my sister's channel it's the strawberry and it's link in the description uh af you should thank me for the shout out okay what yeah you should thank me for the shout out what i don't want to shout out anyways let's move on to uh the game mode okay let's move on to the game editor so first off i'm not going to be showing you how to i'm not going to be explaining i'm going to do step by step but anyways this is just uh what we're going to be doing today it's going to look somewhat like this so you have a player right here and you can walk around i'm not sure if the sound is too loud or not but yeah basically you have a player um and there is some mobs or like some entities for you to fight and you can fight against them like that oh i was looking at obs um but yeah you can fight with them uh and you can like hop around on the stairs and stuff uh and yeah you can do a lot of stuff it's with 3d so yeah it's very uh has a lot of uh how you call it it has a lot of different varieties you can do um there is different mobs you can work with too there's these mobs and i will be showing you how to do all of this how to have the victory and everything so yeah let's get started so first of all let us go back into the home screen um you should probably download your sandbox game maker first and it would look something like this when you come into it and in here you will have three which is three options my games templates and galleries templates is like going to teach you some lessons and stuff uh you can click on there and you can experiment around with it gallery is what other people did before and you can go check it out for yourself um i played some of them already and they are pretty fun um was asked why oscar a camping warrior and etc they are really good they the people who made them are talented um but today i will be showing you the physics and how to pan around it how to zoom in zoom out how to add some uh how to delete stuff how to add stuff how to make mobs attack you etc and how to have a sword even so stick around until the end of the video because this video is jampacked with facts so let's enter in our experience name so what you want to do is click here and then after that just enter in your name i will enter this tutorial like so and here you can select a grid to one by one two by two um and all of these grids however i am going to be doing one by one since it will not lag your computer as much if you do four by four it's quite big and i find that quite unnecessary one by one is big enough uh like my other game it was a one by one and i still had plenty of space to do what i wanted to do so one by one it lets you work with it without lag so let's click on one by one you can also select the theme um and there's multiple themes for you like it's going to be terrain kind of ish and there's going to be like whatever it says there's going to be a lake desert nether meadow antarctica jungle island etc but i will be doing it on empty since we can design our own things so once we do that we're going to click create and it will come into the loading page once we did that we will hop into a screen like this and what you want to do first is if you are experienced with games then you can move around with w a s d w is forwards s is backwards a is left and d is right okay so those are the controls to move around and you can zoom and zoom out um to basically get the fov you want you can also pan around like this doing a 360. with the um controls q and e q and e um q is to go turn pan right e is to pan left and the difference between holding a is a just lets you on like um to the side but cue actually wraps around like this um if you want to uh basically rotate around like a certain object like this one press alt and then click on the space you want the camera to rotate around so i want to rotate around this spawn point so alt click and there we go you can drag your mouse around while holding alt and it will be something like this which is pretty cool and that is basically the basic controls of course there is middle click too which helps you pan around like this basically wasd but just it's quicker um anyways there is more commands but i will not be showing you every single one since i already showed you the basics and what you should use so there we go that is the command and let's get to building so how to place a block you might wonder uh what you want to do is if if you ever played minecraft before this is kind of like minecraft click l or in minecraft you would click e but this one's l and now we can take a look at the stuff we have so we have blocks if you click on blocks there is going to be blocks for you to choose and how you can build with um i will be choosing a dirt brown okay a dirt brown okay once we chose our block we will just simply drag it into our inventory or hot bar so i drag into my first slot then after that i can have uh i'll have another one i'll have cobblestone with grass and i will have a asphalt lining like this one actually no i'll have a asphalt with clean white and black there so now once my hot bar is filled i press l again and then it will get me to this page um you can click on this arrow to hide in or out the hud and yeah so now once we have our hotbar slot filled with four blocks the way to place it is um not like minecraft minecraft uh if you hold left click then it will be breaking the blocks and if you press right click then it will be placing it but it's just opposite in here so you click left to place it click right on the block to delete it so let's place it down first so let's build like a house or something around this spawn point um so the way to zoom not zoom but to have a top down view is to hold alt and hold your not your scroll wheel sorry your left click and now we can build whatever we want like this okay like so and now we build uh one two three four five a five by five uh thing i think sorry house um around our spawn point and of course we can do much more but i'll just show you how to place and break blocks first so here we place all our blocks so it's now three blocks high okay and then you can place it into like this okay you can change your point of view to get an easier um easier way to not wait easier uh angle to put your blocks so now if we want to play our game what we want to do is we want to press tab and then it will basically switch from editor to play so if you hold tab it will go like this and now you spawn in here um in our little dirt hut that we made like so and you can actually be the player and you can run around and uh to punch something let me actually get an entity for this so the way to get an entity is you want to go into your library again and click on the entity right here entity library you can get any of them i guess um but i will get the beaver like so place a beaver down and once you did that what we want to do is we want to click on this thing right here um and once you click on the beaver you can actually assign this is to move by the way um if you click on this thing and you click on the beaver you can actually assign the behaviors that it has so right now it's on prey and what prey does is basically if there's a predator around when the predator is hungry it will chase the prey i will show you that example later but what you want to do is we want to just punch it first i guess um so we'll just have it as a as maybe uh maybe a melee enemy which will actually attack us back but if we turn all these down then it won't attack us anymore but anyways we will now be able to punch this thing so let's hold press tab again as you can see it comes comes after us immediately because it's a melee enemy um and this one you can use for your mobs uh the way to if it actually gets close it can bite you and you can notice that your health will actually go down from that so uh if you have a melee enemy stay away from them um anyways if you left click while you're a player you can hit them like that and you can see that i did nine damage to the beaver um hey she'll feel for a second shield so you can you can also hold sprint uh not hold sprint hold shift to sprint away like this and then uh you can run faster than the beaver you can press spacebar to jump and you can hold right click to block with your sword blocking with your sword will allow you to not take any damage like this and there is one very important fact that we should know is that if we uh block right as they attack then it will be a perfect parry and what it does is basically it will um stun them for a second and it will basically make them uh dazed and which will allow you to get some free hits without them attacking you so let me try oh i'm sorry he attacked me so what trick is to wait until it's red and there we go perfect parry and you can see these days and now you can get some free hits off them um it's if you think about it it's like a survival game it's pretty fun uh but yeah that is my explanation i'm of but anyways you can kill them and if you hold down left click you actually recharge your super power like this and it will do more damage to them and it will go through if they block if they block you can do this and it will go through their shield so yeah that is some basic controls there's another one which is if you hold if you press shift with left click you'll and forward i guess oh yeah you'll lunge attack so it's quite hard to do yeah there we go so um w shift left click will let you throw like a thrust attack i'm pretty sure that's what they call it thrust attack okay there we go see it thrusts itself forward so you have to be oh well that's roll there's some thrust it's really hard to get for some reason there you go so shift and then forward and left click at the same time so shift first forward left click yeah there we go shift forward left click shift forward left click there we go so that is how to rust attack and to roll is i'm pretty sure shift and um left click right oh okay um never mind it's not that but what we can do if we're not sure is we can click on options click on settings uh controls and now we can actually see the controls quick combo attack um and etc so actually let me go back there please okay there okay now we can see how to do stuff um so where is it heavy attack hold um hold uh the left click which is the super power first attack is w and left click perry is that dodge is just uh w right and show hide life is l okay so uh dodge is just w hello i'm pretty new oh oh oh i got it for some reason but i don't oh oh it's just shipped it's just shift okay to dodge is just shift and you will dodge and i'm pretty sure to dodge attack there is a dodge attack but i'm not sure what it is but you can dodge or roll with chip like this okay anyways let's get back to our editor so once we're in here i'm going to delete this little creature over here how you can delete something is you click on a block or something or anything basically and you right click on them oops never mind that's for blocks um how to delete an entity is to click over here click on the entity and delete there we go and that's how you delete an entity um now let's actually make a course so our character can fight uh enemy and actually ha uh win the game so i'm going to make a little pathway oh and let's do some parkour too cause you know it's quite cool okay so the way to delete a massive chunk is to just uh let let's pretend we have uh let's build something a lot right we don't need to keep on placing it like this i forgot you can actually hold down left click and you can drag to create a grid out of how big you want instead of just placing it one by one so now we have a really big grid and the way to delete it is to hold right uh and then just delete your thing so that applies for the ground too uh you can delete a massive patch then refill it like this um and you can delete this again or something but yeah you can not waste your time and you can delete a whole chunk at a time so now once we have a pretty long path i will actually make this a bit longer so that we have room for some parkour okay okay there we go so now once we parkour over there there will be an ending over here so we will let's create some parkour blocks shall we so let's have uh like this and then like this and then even higher three blocks and then one really really really really far away three blocks two and then let's just delete a little bit more and then like this and then this is where the boss fights happen and if we weren't if we run our code right now we can actually try it like this oops there you go and of course you can um sprint while you're jumping which will increase the jump length but i did it so that you don't need to sprint because sometimes people forget to sprint and they just fall off so yeah and now what we're gonna do is right now if you fall over here it basically does nothing um you can just start over again but what we want to do is we want if you fall into here on this part um then you will basically die and then you will come back to your checkpoint over here and then you will just do it again so let's make that first we have to elevate each one by one no actually we can just delete it but that's too much work so i will just elevate it by one like this um and it should still work there we go okay it still works um and we're gonna fill this part with lava or any block of your choice um so once we do that we will click l and i will search for lava there we go i'll get lava here and we will press l again and we'll just fill up this space right here with some lava um actually i'm pretty sure i can just yeah i'm pretty sure i can just do oh sorry i'm pretty sure i can just hold it and oh okay there we go and now the whole thing is filled with lava we can have little uh barriers on the side to make sure they can't escape like so um there we go a player is two blocks high by the way so once we did that let's try it out and of course the lava is not gonna kill us yet because we didn't program it too so if we were still in the lava it wouldn't do anything we can come back up here and then we can redo it but let's make sure that the lava actually kills us so how we do that is we can go into uh global parameters right here or global parameters go into controller on components uh so this is what the player will get hurt by and we can see over here damaging blocks so uh we want the lava to be the damaging blocks right so let's put some lava in here click on the lava by the way click here to edit it so once you do that press lava and block damage meaning how much damage should it do if we want all one hit meaning we have 100 health for a player we can set this to 100 which will insta kill once we did that it should kill us if we press tab again there we go it insta kills um oh and there you go that is the basics of of the parkour course okay i should make a little starting area maybe i should delete the house because you know it's kind of in the way so yeah let's uh delete the house so again deleting is pretty simple just you do this um i will delete this it's really easy to delete too because you know we can delete a whole chunk at a time there we go and now we have a starting area over here we can move the starting area by clicking on this thing and then we can click on the starting area and we can use these xy coordinates to move it or we can click on the plane right here to move it around but i will just use the xy coordinates since they are more accurate and once we did that we can just surround it back by uh these blocks so they can't escape there we go i why i was placing one by one but there so now we have our starting area like this and it's much better because there is nothing blocking you from jumping like this and you made it to the end so yeah that is the parkour course and let's add some enemies at the end so when they kill the enemies um we can win so let's add some space for the enemies let me use the white one now oh that's the black one oh my i accidentally deleted the white one um let me go search for it white asphalt there we go and we put it back into our hotbar slot okay now we can place it oh that's that's number four okay let's place it back okay there we go and now let's build a little wall here oh no i don't want to build with the same one okay oops okay like this and like this and now you can uh for the mob you can do any any mob you want uh and any entity sorry any entity you want so as long as it works so once we are done with this we will let's uh put in the entity so what entity shall we put in i was thinking of putting in the beaver but then i didn't really like killing it that time because it made me feel bad but let's try uh another entity uh maybe an evil one so i don't feel so bad about killing it okay um there's camels they're oh here here all right here are the evil ones there is detector defector block bot three um or defector bot i will get defector bot three since it looks way more evil oh so we put into our hot bar slot press l and we'll place it right in the center there we go that it looks like a chicken it looks like a chicken but um anyways this is our defector bot this i realized it was the back of it let me spin around hey there we go looks like a chicken um but anyways we oh oh i didn't mean to place it um we can control z like so and we can assign the behaviors by clicking on this then clicking on our entity and we can assign a physic uh do we want it to be collision collision means that when the player runs into it he can't just run through and i would recommend to put it on yes uh and then collision plus gravity i recommend no because if it is then it will just go flying so just collision and you can even name it i will name this chicken bot because it looks like a chicken and once we did that we can assign the behavior so right now it is assigned as melee enemy which means it will attack us and we can change the the how you call it the stats by ourselves right now it's on all maxed meaning it's the strongest um we can there's the health and we can add the component a component will basically let us uh win or lose so we can press on victory and we can do on death so when this dies it will become victory okay and now let's add it so that it can um block hits i am pretty sure it's somewhere around uh here i'm not sure though okay there press on edit logic and now you can have a bunch more uh a bunch more options so now we can do can block attack equals to true and now it will be able to block our attacks attack range we can make it this wide health is here uh and yeah there it is we can make it invincible too but anyways that is it so let it let us try of course this is not the finished product this is just a prototype and we can jump here jump there like so and then it realizes but since it's smart it doesn't come here because you know it's not high enough oh i didn't mean to i didn't know running forward would i mean pressing this uh oh no i didn't know pressing the left click would send me forward oh okay there you go so oh my gosh you know i just run on the wall okay for the sake of the video i will run on the wall of course you can make your wall higher um you can even make it invisible which what i will do but to make it not uh to make it cleaner but anyways let's resume uh like there is no gap okay so once we are here we can just hop in and we can start fighting like this but as you can see he's blocking every single hit a way to uh basically fix this problem is to every time he's going to hit you you block it perfectly oh sorry you blocked it perfectly so now you get a perfect parry which will daze him and you get some hits off him too like so and now you win like so um pretty simple pretty fun to do um it's very easy to code which i like i don't like like uh coding where it's like hard to do this coding is very simple you don't need any experience at all and you can do this um and yeah you can have fun with it all you want there's also another trick i want to show you is if you do your super attack it goes through his shield too so yeah that's pretty fun anyways you can make him a little bit more buff by uh making yourself more nerfed so let's go into the player settings which is in global parameters and go into a player controller and go into components but not components avatar sorry and we can go down here and we can look on sword and shield turn those into none so that now the players need to use their fist okay okay once we did that we can now close this up and we can do it again so now now players only have their fist to block and hit which will do less damage of course okay now you can block it while they're doing it so three two one there we go okay oh oh okay so we can oh sorry we can still use our magic power by the way even though we don't have any sword now oh no i'm really bad at parkour and there's also a little secret i want to show you at the end so stay tuned to find out about it there we go one hit and victory so now let's make the walls invisible first let's make it so that they are taller than the player so they can't jump out so oops okay let me zoom out a little bit okay there and now we will make it one more higher actually we should make it two more because one more wouldn't be enough okay place blocks okay there we go oh okay there we go i remember there was there but i just can't find it now but if i ever find it then i will tell you guys however right now i can't seem to find it so we're gonna have to stick with this wall first so let us play it again and now i'm pretty sure you can't jump out right yeah you can't jump out anymore even with the tallest one you can't jump because you're not two blocks high i mean you are more than two blocks high uh so now oh you can still jump out over here so let us edit that okay let me put this thing oh we had to change it back to free oh that was not the block this is okay okay there we go like oh no okay like this and there now you cannot jump out okay okay now you can just one shot this but i don't want to do that because it's not interesting so let's get a perfect parry and let's open okay three two one okay now we can just beat him up there we go and victory um there's also a thing where you can go into first person which is quite interesting so get a camera and get to first person and place on head equals to yes so now it will be first person and it will look much cooler when you're doing the parkour but you can't really see too much of yourself you can see sometimes your sword and your shadow but other than that you can't really see too much let me drink some water and when you're doing the parkour it looks really insane it looks really cool like you're in vr but when you're fighting it doesn't look too insane because you can't really see the health but anyways let's do some parkour so you can do like this oh okay okay okay okay there we go looks really cool but when you're fighting it looks kind of scary in real life oh okay ah no i fell so let's try to fight in oh no let's try to find first person so we can actually experience it no if i can actually complete the parkour okay if i don't make this i will just put the spawning point over here yeah okay i'm just gonna put the spawning point over there it's my you know what it's okay i'll just put it here because that's gonna screw up the point of the parkour oh okay there we go okay now i made it i made it and i'll just jump in here fight fight oh and you can block it but you ca you can tell when he attacks so you try to block it for perfect perry okay definitely not definitely not perfect perry perfect parry oh it was yeah i got it so that is um the how do you call it that is first person we can actually add more stuff so we can click on rules over here and we can do welcoming players um camera welcome and then we can just uh do whatever we want i will do this world center no actually i'll do avatar so now we will basically be able to call ourself the level name is going to be chicken chicken parkour like so oh parkhuro parkour and we will have our description which is complete the parkour uh core and kill the evil chicken robot chicken robot like this and we can actually assign some music to it but i'm not going to be doing that today you can do that but uh i will not um it you can feel free to do that but i am not going to do that for today so if we were to pray not play right now you can see that it like rotates around our player and it has their description complete the parkour and kill the evil chicken robot and the starting an adventure in chicken parkour so if we were to click we will come into this land right here and okay there we go no okay and we can just complete it again if i can do that but yeah that is the basics of game editor of course i still don't know a lot so if i get some facts wrong then um it's my first time so don't judge me too hard oh i just realized he's wearing a bandana but anyways that is it for today's video i hope you enjoyed um and yeah let's beat this guy for the last time um like so okay oop perfect carry there we go um and yeah that is our uh parkour um and how to add some mobs in i hope you like it and see you in the next video bye
