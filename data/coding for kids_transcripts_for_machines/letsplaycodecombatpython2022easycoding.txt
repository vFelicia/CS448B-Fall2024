hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be continuing my series of teaching myself python in the future so i i won't forget in the future and today is day six of that or ep six and today i'm going to be showing you a new game i found called code combat it's actually like a python game and it's really easy to use if i don't have face cam in this video um the reason is because last video my green screen was horrible and um so i don't think i should use it anymore because i'm not in my normal recording setup so i'm just not going to use facecam for now and yeah so this is just a blank screen but anyways uh what we're going to do is we're going to open our browser you can use chrome or edge or whatever you use i'm going to use opera because it's uh it's the browser i use and after that you just type in code combat like so and then uh press enter and then the first link codecombat.com will be the link we want to go to so clickcombat.com we're gonna click sign up because we don't have the account yet okay once you click sign up uh you click uh where you are but i'm gonna say i'm an individual because i play at home so i think you should do i'm an individual so after that enter your birthday february 28th uh you can i'm not sure about the year but i'm just gonna over extend it so i don't get like uh i don't get cancelled or something i don't know um but uh so i use my own birthday and click continue and then from there you enter your gmail address i'm gonna have to blur this part out but you can use any gmail address that is yours and i am clicking mine and then you can enter username anything i'm gonna enter in like uh like something uh let's see jimmy or just coding for catapult coding for kit like so okay it's already taken who took my name is that coding for kid okay well we're gonna do coding for a kid or a single kid a single child okay coding for kid uh the password uh you know anything you would want i'm just gonna have mines or something i'm not gonna tell you of course but uh just choose your password four to sixty four characters with no repeating bruh what the heck why is your password so strict and once you're done with your password we're just gonna retype to make sure our i almost said my password all right um you can even sign in with google if you want but i'm just going to do it this way and then we're going to click create account and there you go that your account has been created and now we click click start playing all right now you're in this world right here and there is a lot of stuff we can do but of course we have to start off with number one since all of them are locked and today i'm not going to be doing all of them i'm just going to be doing um i'm going to be doing only this one there's so much uh to learn there's like simple ai scripting uh create uh keep learning html arithmetic arithmetic arithmetic uh bro i can't say arithmetic okay counters while loops break uh blah blah advanced techniques okay so we're going to just be starting with kit guard dungeon today so click play and there is sound but if you don't like it you can mute the tab i'm going to mute it a little bit because it's a bit too loud it's a little distracting so here where's where you start and you keep on going until you're out at exit right here so we can click right here and we can click play and you can choose your heroes from this guy to this guy because we can't really choose these since uh we have to subscribe um so i'm not gonna choose that i'm gonna choose uh this guy i played this at school before and i played with this guy this doesn't really matter um because i don't know i when i do it it doesn't really do anything you can choose any character you want definitely not this guy this is one of the worst people look look at their stats like come on okay i'm gonna shoot this guy and click next and why is he so short um we're going to click equip and then we can click play equip is just a little accessory we can use uh because it gives us a little uh functions move down move left move right move up so we can uh actually code and here we have a simple task uh for us to do we can we have to get grab the treasure i'm gonna click escape we just grab the treasure and we have to not die to the spike so move down after that move right like so and then uh move i think that's it so we can click run move down move that all right move right move down move right and there you go we collected the gem and that's it we're done and that's how to uh complete it there is like a little uh how do you call that achievements or goals that we have to do and if we complete it we'll go to success and click done right here and there you go you get your victory whatever uh you can there's also leaderboards by the way uh and you can see i'm number four i'm tied with everybody else with 7.7 seconds all time is three seconds 3.5 but i'm pretty sure they're just using a macro these are really long time ago too seven years ago but i'm pretty sure it's uh like um like a macro like they just have it on their mouse press it yo yo uh i'm gonna watch them back then back then they didn't even have move forwards hold on so since this was like seven years ago right before code combat was even like uh like more advanced like nowadays they had to have like self move uh x dot y uh self dot position x plus 11 self position a y plus one man that must be hard and then they have self cast haste so you can see they make themself have haste and then that made them go much faster than the normal person would wow yeah that's fast okay but anyways we're gonna go to um go back and then we're gonna click out and we're going to rest on to the other one gems in the deep i'm going to do 10 or something today as you can see we've got a new item it's called the leather belt and it's a thick belt that adds a little extra help okay we're going to click play and you can even change your language if you want but i'm going to stick with python so we're going to move right we're going to move down and this practice python for us because instead of just coding programs and stuff you can actually like implement it into like a game and it's more fun for everybody you can see our goals are to afford the spikes and collect the gems and we did just that we avoided the spikes grab the gems with a code uh simple move right move down move up move up right and from here this x actually looks very simple but it's going to be um it's going to start to get more advanced as we go on so i i don't know i'm competitive i want to check my stats what they oh they're that quicker than me man well that means i'm quicker than them right i'm not sure but uh that's from the latest so all time all time is 3.7 seconds wow that's really quick all right let's move on to the next one shadow guard uh there's no there's nothing that we can unlock yet we're gonna lock this guy pretty good at protecting your innards um or health times one point one i locked 67 or a glove i think i'll go with the go to the tarnish bronze thing okay let's confirm yey we have a chest plate okay we can click play it's pretty fun um it reminds me like dot a and yeah i played at school it's really competitive there's like a dueling thing and it was like fun for just doing your friends all right so we have to not running the spikes don't let the ogre see you so this guy and we have to get get all the gems so instead of moving forwards we have to move around right so click move move up right move up and then from there we move right again move right and then move down oh shoot move down move right all right and then now we should be good okay let's see uh don't see us nice okay now we go up as you can see goes to success we can just press done uh and there you go victory we're gonna click continue and our next one is enemy mine and uh let's see can you unlock anything uh this is the daily quest we it gives you extra gems but honestly i don't really care i just press done and i'll just press play and then i will it's restricted what man that's not fun all right so let's press enemy mind let's play it play and uh now there's start to getting like uh like this is like the local variable for functions you know when you define it you have little uh variable you can put in yeah that's how that's what you're doing right now you can put in two to move twice all right let's see this map oh wow this is a this is quite a big map okay let's zoom out a bit okay so what do we have to do we have to avoid the fire traps i'm going to assume that these are the fire traps we have to get the gem so the gem is all the way at the exit so if we get the gem we're basically at the exit and then use five lines or co of code or less so i'm gonna go this way then up right down and then right again all right so that shouldn't be too hard we move right three times and then we move up once so move up move right and then move down one two three so move down three times move down three times and then move right twice like so we should be okay oh the goals are still incomplete let's see why oh shoot oh shoot that's not good okay wait what did we do okay move up no i meant move down okay move down like so okay let's see man that was brutal oh my gosh uh it's still not working why is it okay wait wait hold on there's something wrong so we move up right and then we move right and then what happens from there why do we why do we move up i i said move down huh wait a minute is it bugged oh no uh let's try rewriting the code move down move down three times okay hopefully it works ah finally okay there's like a bug in the system or something okay go go go nice oh i want to see the ogre getting demolished okay let's watch this boom yeah ll okay we've done this one and let's click on continue and then our next one is true names okay let's see what this one does all right so now we're going to have a new equipment which is about the sword um that it makes it so that we can attack the ogres so yeah okay i see rack and tread this uh is very menacing okay so if we were to run this right now we would hero would go up and attack brac all right and then we have to get the gem and kill treg right okay so well not kill i guess attack okay attack trek twice and collect the gem uh we don't need to exit right yeah i don't think we need to exit just attack trick okay so we're gonna move forward twice move forward or uh right twice twice and then we attack so we're just gonna copy and paste brack right here like so and then change we're going to change this to drag i'm not sure if it's case sensitive but just might might as well just type it in correctly all right let's see and move right twice oh okay not even twice that we're losing our health that's not good i don't want i don't want this guy to get hurt so move only once let's see attack bam bam easy okay so that's it uh i'm not sure if our hero has anything to do with this if your heroes like um attack is like not as like good as some heroes i'm not sure if that will affect your code in some way but i don't think so i think it's just there for fun um sell commentary all right trapped in the prison cell with the famous wizard say the password to get the wizard's help and there you go you run into the ad okay well we're not gonna go this way we're gonna go this way oh no this is where they hit us with a good old paycheck you
