hello everybody welcome back to another video today i will be giving you a brief overview on uh seabourn pandas and matplotlib basically today we're going to be looking at patterns inside of the pokemon dataset which we found earlier in the uh other stream or video and we're going to be using this link for our information of pokemon i will leave it in the description basically it's just uh a page full of data's about pokemon there is the name the type 1 type 2 the hp the attack defense the special attack and the special defense at first i thought this was speed attack and speed defense but i was wrong it's actually special attack and special defense um there's the speed generation and legendary so we're gonna be using this data set uh for today's video um and today video we're just going to be looking at patterns inside of the pokemon data set using graphs so we're going to be trying to find like uh unique patterns that happen inside of this graph so let's begin first we got to import our libraries that we need which is pandas matplotlib.piplot and seaborn if you don't have these pip install yet then you should uh but with colab you don't need to you can just pip installed here by using this command exclamation point pip install and whatever you want after that uh like seaborn like so uh you can also do this with matplotlib and pandas but i would recommend you to go into your command prompt or cmd uh let me show you how so go into here type in cmd open it up and then type in a pip no exclamation point this time install matplotlib or pip install seaborn and uh last but not least pandas like this um and this will basically make sure that inside of your computer or python libraries there is going to be these libraries installed too i would recommend you to do that but you don't have to you can just install it from collab so once we have pip installed we want to import them and we're going to import pandas as pd um this is to use uh to shorten the names instead of having to type out pandas dot uh something or matplotlib dot pi plot dot seaborn dot we just need to type out pd.plt dot and sns dot uh which is really short and simple to use after that we need matplotlib inline uh this is so that we can display our graph instead of like having nothing if you don't have this then you won't be able to see the graphs so you must have this code now let's move on to the next one this will basically grab the pokemon data set we need so you might have already saw the link this is what it looks like uh it just has a bunch of pokemons uh type one type two the name and etc and we're gonna be grabbing this information and then we're gonna put it inside pokey data so uh this one basically grabs it and then it stores it inside a path so this is the path of a github content pokemon underscore dataset.csv uh use this one to get the path and then after that pokeydata equals to pd which is pandas.read.csv this will read the csv file um at the path and it will have index column goes to zero this will basically store our whole entire data set or this whole page right here into this variable or this pandas panda data frame pokey data and then now we have a data set of our own called pokedata let's run this oh shoot i forgot to run this one i keep on forgetting to import stuff once i get explaining i just lose track um but let's wait for it to connect to our google drive first and then it's it's going to come with an error for sure um but we just got to run this one and this one and this one so let's import our libraries okay and then after that we will grab the information and it will come up like a bunch of stuff here but don't worry this is correct it's not an error or anything 100 um so this is just make sure that stored in and then after that in here we'll just store the information into pokedata perfect now we have all our information inside of pokedata uh now this works as uh any data set would you can do uh like this one print out the type one it will only print out the column type one so we can see here it has 800 rows of type 1 and i'm not sure how much columns it has but we can also check by using this command pokeydata.com but we're not there yet first i want to do something actually let me show you something uh let's type in pokedata pokedata it would be good if we have this copied pokedata dot um not dot head which will print out the first five uh rows and all the columns like so and now here is what it looks like into a data frame uh there's the name type one type 2 everything that that page has uh and there is these which are the integers it's the hp the attack the defense the special attack the special defense and the speed um i will combine all of these into one column which i will call total uh in total it's just going to be the overall stats of the pokemon uh so in here we're going to make that happen so we're going to have pokedata brackets inside we will name our new column uh i named it total because it's uh what i want to name it you can name it anything like overall or uh that uh stats or anything um and this will equal to pokedata hp uh hp plus pokedata attack this one defense s special attack or speed first special attack special defense and then finally special oh i have two special attacks i'm so sorry i have two special attacks i'm supposed to have special defense oh how could i let this go okay so once we have that all added up we want to do is we want to run it so shift enter to run um and once you did that let's look at the columns so pokedata.com will just print out all the column names so we have name type 1 type 2 hp attack defense special attack special defense the speed the generation and legendary finally we have the new column which we just made called total if we were to run dot head again then we would have an extra uh an extra column here which is total okay let's move on um now we can just uh oh i have another head here it's okay i don't need that so now we can just move on to our graphs or our plots we're going to be starting off with the count plot um so let's run it this count plot will be about the type one so it will just list out how much type ones there are the xaxis is the type one as you can see and the yaxis is account account is basically how much pokemons are there or the number of it so there's uh above 100 pokemons with water type around 125 pokemons with water type and then we can see like uh 70 pokemons with grass types s um on and on uh also we can see that the least one is the flying type which is um around two pokemons with flying type as type one because this is because uh well all pokemons well not all pokemons but most of the pokemons can fly they have the ability to fly but it's not like their main uh ability like charizard like he can fly or it can fly um but they're the main type is fire and like uh articuno it's a legendary bird i'm pretty sure it's ice um it can fly but it's iced so type one is ice uh and zapdos uh moltres ho o and so on and so on they all can fly but it's not like their main type and also all the bug pokemons like um like i forget their name um no metapod no metapod can't fly what's the evolution of metapod uh b b drop b drill b drill okay be drill right if it's not then i'm gonna look like really dumb okay it's beedrill okay like virgil can fly but it's like a bug type so it's not really like the main type but since all pokemons can fly or not all but most of them can fly type 2 will probably be flying um i made a prediction that it would be flying because it's you know all pokemons can fly but it's not like their main ability so they probably put it in type two let's see so this one i changed it uh instead of having type one as the xaxis i made type two as the xaxis and you can see that flying just out outweighs every single uh type since uh you know not much not as much pokemons have uh these types as their type two most of them have it as their type one but you can see flying has like like most of the count because uh you know as i said earlier and he said this probably a hundred times but most pokemons can fly so they put their type two as flying however it's not like their main special ability so they don't put it as type one unless some special cases then maybe they put it as type one because we can see here that some pokemons do have flying as their type one okay let's move on to the box plot the box plot looks somewhat like this now i will explain to you in detail what this is it might look very confusing at first but trust me it's not so uh this colorful blocks no blocks box in the middle is the average or the regression of the entire uh of the range so this is the average um you can see all of this is the average and then the actual range itself is these two lines over here these two lines um so the hp i'm gonna compare between the hp the attack the defense and the speed so uh on the left side is just how much it is uh so in here the hp you can see that it's around the range or the average is around 125 to zero and then inside of that it has the regression which is around 50 to 75 so this is worth like the average hp is and that goes for the attack defense and speed however we can see these little diamond shapes these are called the outliners uh the outliners are like those um those people like maybe in your school or something that is like very good at something or very bad at something so these are the outliners either they're very good or too good in that category or too bad so we can see as a good example in hp here uh there is a bunch of outliners that is like exceeding the normal hp limit but you can see that there is one that has zero hp or one hp i'm not sure what this one is but you can see it's an outliner it has no hp at all but these ones have like a bunch of hp um and we can see that these two are very outstanding hp i'll give you a guess on which uh which pokemons are these uh your time is up but for me i since i play a lot of pokemon go i know that these two are probably chansey and blissy since they are very uh tank uh they tank a lot of hits like from the best attacker in pokemon go which is alkazam using sidestrike they can withstand a lot of hits too i watch a youtube video on it it's pretty cool it can like it it almost outweighs the gym time uh so whenever you battle a gym i'm gonna go off track a little but whenever you battle a gym you have a limited amount of time to beat it if you don't then you just get sent out and then you have to retry again but chansey can take a lot of hits and it takes like around half the time to kill chancy or to like knock it out and if there was like not chancy sorry blissey um and if pretend there was like three chant blisseys inside of the of the gym then you wouldn't have enough time to uh defeat the gym unless you defeat one of them and then get their hp low enough so you can defeat them quicker um the next round but yeah anyways i'm going off track chansey and blissey are very good at tanking uh and they are very high hp too and then yeah this is the box plot it helps us find the outliners and the medium or the regression line in the middle so yeah that's the box plot now let's look at the scatter plot the scatter plot is a bunch of dots and it kind of looked complicated but i'll explain to you very simply and i am using the x axis as defense and the y axis as attack so we can see if it correlates with each other or not so we can see here that it is not as like great uh so we can see that the more attack the less defense usually okay like over here the more attack you have the less defense you will have unless it's like a very good pokemon like this one it has pretty good defense and really good attack but most of it is around over here which is like okay defense okay attack but it's not like if you have more more defense then you have more attack it's kind of the opposite if you have more attack then you have less defense if you have more defense then you have less attack but like as you can see these are outliners which like they don't go under the same rules as other people and this is probably not chancy though not chancey or blissey since they do no damage at all even though they're really good at tanking they do like five attack damage they're really really weak for attacking but um yeah anyways they uh these are some outliners that don't follow the rules but most of the pokemon follow the rules and go like if you have a lot of attack then you have less defense you have a lot of defense then you don't have that much attack so this is a way to find out some patterns let's move on to lm plot lm plot uh i will show you right now it looks somewhat complicated as i said earlier but it's very simple so we can see there's a bunch of lines in the middle uh let me explain the lines first the lines are the average of uh the types so here we can see the types and uh this is because we put in the command hue equals to type one hue basically lets us um see in more detail of the graph if we don't have the command hue then this is what would look like it'll be all blue um it'll probably look a little bit more simple but it's not that detailed uh and we won't know what which dot is what type and each dot is a pokemon by the way so now if we do this we can see the type of the pokemon it might take a little while but here it comes so we can see each type so like this one we know it's like a water type um and like the blue one is probably like a rock or a ghost type uh but yeah we can see more detail of the graph and we can also see that let me show you these two up here um you probably know which one it is since it's like 250 hp and 255 hp and i'll give you a hint they're both uh where is it they're both is chanting normal type i think chansey is normal type right uh chansey type type probably normal type yeah so it's normal type so we can see here that since it's normal type uh and there's a lot of hp it's probably chancy and blissy since we already looked at that um but yeah so we can see the types of each pokemon and we can see like the average of each type through the lines and looks like most of them are around here around 50 hp to 150 hp from uh 200 total to 500 total somewhere so yeah this is uh the average line of pokemons but as i said earlier there is some outliners that don't follow the rules and they just do like uh amazing at something or really bad at something okay let's move on to the pair plot the pair plot looks somewhat like this sorry if there's a big sound in the background but anyways the pair plot looks uh it's kind of slow because it's a it's a big plot um but it has scatter plots on the side and through the middle it's a histogram okay one second um because it since it's really big it takes a lot of time to load uh if i have collab pro on another account i just didn't log in with it today but yeah as you can see this is a kde plot through the middle like so and on the sides there is a scatter plot uh so this is a kde plot also i mean not kd a pair plot and this there is a type on the side it's called the legion i'm pretty sure and it's used with the command heel also we have we're comparing the hp the attack the defense the special attack the special defense the speed and type 1 of each pokemon so we can see uh let's look at the speed with the hp so uh we can see that the more speed you have the less hp you'll get so like these uh we can see that it's more clumped around here because most of the pokemons have pretty good speed so they don't have too much hp uh let's look at another one okay let's look at a special attack with the speed so if your special attack does like 100 damage then you'll have around 75 speed um and we can also tell by the kde uh plots that uh the information so if you have like 200 150 hp then let's scroll down did your oh no this is hp with hp so um it just goes together uh by the way these are all the same category as each other so the speed with speed um the special defense or the special defense so uh yeah you can't really rely on these since they're not as accurate since they are the same category but what you should be looking at is these scatter plots on the top right and the bottom left and let's move on to the strip plot um the strip plot uh we sometimes use a swarm plot instead of the strip plot but since the strip plot is better because it uses less room than the the swarm plot and it's kind of used like a box plot it's to find outliners but it doesn't do as good as a job as the box plot does so we can see here we have the special attack the special defense the attack and defense so we're going to compare all of them and we can see that uh there is outliners over here but we can't really cut them off anywhere uh like unlike the blocks plot which shows like very detailed like these are the outliners we have to like try to see by ourselves which one is going over and where is like the average of it so it's more harder to use than a box plot however for me it is more colorful and more fun to look at um than a box plot since it looks more colorful and simple um but yeah let's move on to the joint plot the joint plot we have the xaxis as the hp and the yaxis as the attack um and our data is of course our pokedata uh a drawing plot is just one big plot like so and there's histograms on the outside and inside there is the scatter plot so we're going to be comparing the attack in the hp so it looks like that the less of hp you have the more attack you have but the more hp then the less attack um these again are the outliners blissey and chancy um but yeah we can see that they have very low attack damage since they have a lot of hp so either goes both ways if you want a lot of hp and you have to sacrifice your attack but if you want a lot of attack then you have to sacrifice your hp so look at these ones uh they have like 200 no not 200 yeah 200 a roundish attack damage but their hp is not so good around 100 um but yeah anyways that is the joint plot and let's move on to our last one which is the hiss plot or the histogram plot um the histogram plot you only need to set one axis since the other one will be the count it's kind of like the count plot but we can see uh that the xaxis that we're going to be using is the total um which is like as i said earlier the overall stats of the pokemon and to the yaxis we have the count or how much are in each category so at 500 total uh there is around 140 pokemons that has a total of 500 um and there is like this like 700 not 700 but around 700 uh total on one pokemon around so one pokemon has around 725 total also there is like two that has around 775 total which is really good um but yeah this is another way to look at uh pokemons in through graphs and through python uh it's a fun way to look at it and you can find some patterns throughout your journey looking at graphs so i hope you enjoyed this video uh and thank you very much for watching see you in the next one bye
