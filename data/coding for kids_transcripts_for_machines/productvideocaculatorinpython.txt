hello my name is jemmy today i'm making a product calculator with the bat so um as you can see it's really simple first of all we're going to import all this um which is default so like the tk inter and the ttk then the message box so we there's a message box so we could um make our program and then for the gui go to tk uh yeah put all this stuff in for gui dot title this is for what we're going to um like name our window then we're going to set how bigger when it's going to be so right now it's 400 times 300 after that we're going to set the font to end standard new which everybody should have so we don't get like we have to download font just use this one and then um this is to put in a text um explaining what they have to do so they have to enter their product name um so like what their product like product name is like coffee or um chocolate and then this one is uh to print it i'm pretty sure yeah and then e1 equal ttk this one is to set uh the i think it's how big the text box is yeah the text box and then l equal to ttk.label this is another um text it says enter your product price so it's like how expensive your product is and the last one is to enter your product amount so how much you're gonna buy after that oh sorry this one's for testing hold on let's look at this watch too much techno blade um so define math so now we're going to calculate the name of the product i mean we're not calculating it but we're going to calculate the price of all products um excluding the vat that of a single product and fat of all product and total of all products so yeah what we're gonna do here is we're going to um uh right here we're just going to print the name and the price and the amount normally then down here we're going to uh calculate the um the price of all product which is two times the price and the amount and it would equal to uh right here the formula is price times amount as i said and remember to convert them into integers or floats because um one is that this is a string right now so we have to convert them and now in here is to uh like to calculate the bat so instead of using uh normal integers right now we're going to use um float because some fats are going down to decimals so use a float instead of integer because it will be more um precise and it can do decimals because integers can and floats can after that we're going to w that which is the whole vat so we're figuring out the vat of one uh my single product right now we're going to get that uh that and then times the amount again so now we're going to get the whole bat after that we're going to add the vat plus the mold on the overall price which would equal to w vat plus mole price which is every uh the price times the amount so yeah that's pretty simple and then after that we get a button saying calculate and um command goes to math which is right here since we defined it and set how big the button is so let's test it okay so we're going to start out we're going to make it really simple cause we don't want it that hard so pretend coffee okay right and then in here what do we want um so i know this calculation that's why i'm doing it so product price is a hundred and um the amount is one so here we are that of single product is seven and overall is seven because we only have one product and overall in total is 107. this is very useful if you want to like calculate how expensive your um like online how to call it online marketing or shopping is going to be so yeah make this program and you would calculate it not using your head because i'm too lazy to that yeah and this all this is based on my wikipedia video i used it and i used the code and made this so yep remember that uh you can always use from other programs to develop your own programs even further and that's it for this video see you next episode bye
