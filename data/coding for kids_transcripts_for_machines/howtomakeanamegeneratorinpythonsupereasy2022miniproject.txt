hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be starting a new series called teaching myself python in the future because i will forget python in the future probably so that's why i'm going to start the series and in today's video we're going to be making a name generator in python i'm going to be using jupyter notebook but you can use any other python tools you want like uh if you want to use your notebook but you don't have it you can watch one of my old videos that i show how to install it uh it's in the description so if you want to watch that then go ahead so first off to open your notebook you have to type in cmd in your search bar to open your command prompt and then just type in drew bitter note and then press enter and it will open in your browser like so and then when you're getting to this page or the home screen you're going to press new python 3 ipy kernel and this will create a new kernel or a python file and you can name this whatever you want i'm going to name this name generator like so make sure there's no weird characters or space because that won't work so once you have your name what you're gonna do is you're gonna first welcome them a bit you know make them know what this program is about so let's just say welcome to the name generator you can name you can oops i can't really type like so um and yeah if we were to try to run that it would just say welcome to the name generator you can name it you can name anything with this program uh so yeah once you have that we're gonna ask them a few questions so we're gonna ask them first ready to start wait i forgot i'm a bit blurring today uh start like so equals to input um ready ready to start a question mark and then we're gonna have a little like uh astral like i'm not sure what that thing is um just say press any key to or press enter to continue press enter to continue like so just enter and uh if they press enter then they go to the next one so we're gonna name this one age we're gonna ask for how old they are uh let's say how oops i need to put input input how old are you like so and uh after that we're gonna go with a color so color equals to input um how what is your favorite color oops what is man i really can't type today what is your favorite color and then they're going to put that in and then finally we're going to ask them for their favorite animal so animal equals to input and what is your favorite animal like so and then from then we're gonna combine everything and print into one long name print your the name we suggest is and then we're going to leave this we're going to leave it at that and then we're going to put comma comma is to add another like a variable or something else that you want to put in with your message so in this case we're going to put our age in first so whatever they put in and from then we're going to add color color and then we're going to add animal like so and we to touch it off we're going to add a an exclamation point this i'm using plus because i don't want the space the commas give us so plus and where's the quotation marks here exclamation point there you go so let's try it out uh like so welcome to the name generator you can name anything with this program ready to start press enter to continue you press enter and then it starts how old are you i'll put on 13. what is your favorite color let me capitalize this okay what is your favorite color uh let's just say purple and what is your favorite animal cappy bars like so the name we suggest is 13 purple cappy bars well that's that's a weird name but you can name it for like um i don't know like a group name just 13 purple cappy bars but anyways thank you for watching this video and see you
