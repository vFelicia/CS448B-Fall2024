hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i will be continuing my series of teaching myself python in the future so that i don't forget python in the future um something like that i don't know the series name anymore but today is ep 2 and it's going to be about data types and strings so let's get right into it again i'm going to be using jupyter notebook but you can use any python code editor you want and if you want to install jupyter notebook it's going to be in the description it's a video and you can go follow it so this is the home page of jupiter notebook we're going to press new python 3 ipy kernel right here and we're going to rename our notebook so let's rename this to anything you want actually today we're also going to be making a gpa calculator so you could use that at school if you want i'm going to be naming this data types like so and then i would click rename and once i have it renamed it's a bit messy i'm going to change string to it capital s looks more better okay once we have it name like so we're gonna actually begin our code with welcoming them to what we're gonna be making today we're gonna be making a gpa calculator i might have just said that but um it's gonna be really cool we're gonna make it by yourself so let's say uh print welcome to the world's best gpa calculator like so and you know just to give the user a little hint on what they're uh actually using right now or not using sorry um what they're about to get into so we're gonna have input right here please uh press enter to continue so press enter to continue this is so that we can slow down the program a little bit you know so instead of just rushing them with the questions we're gonna have like uh like a little break so press enter to continue and let's run the code right now i really don't know why it does that like it um the press enter to continue appears before the print but you know it's fine and then if we press enter then it goes out into here but um let's actually put this in the variable so it doesn't have that output thingy now let's run this again all right so once we have done this it just doesn't really do anything yet because we haven't programmed it to do anything i'm going to add some aster licks i'm not sure what that's called uh like so make it look a little bit more professional and then from then we're going to actually ask them the first question so the first question is going to be how much subjects they have right so we need to know the amount so we're going to create a list called amount like so and we're not actually it's not a list it's gonna be an input like so and then we're gonna say how much subjects do you have like so and once we did this uh we're gonna try running again so press enter to continue and then after that we give them a question how much subjects you have they could put in anything they want but they could put in like three or something i'm gonna actually have a little space here so now once we know how much subjects they have we actually don't know what their subject is about so um we should need to ask them what their individual subjects their the name of their subjects like math science uh world civilizations language arts something like that so first let's start off by having a new list called subject list like so so we can store the information like so and then from then we're going to have another question but this is going to be a bit different from other from these ones because we have to repeat it in a loop so for i in range in range white we're going to change this to int amount because um right here this is gonna be like five four three two right so we're gonna have it as uh in here because we're gonna have to go to each one of their subjects and we have to have int here to convert this uh amount or right now it's actually a string even though it's a number it's a string type so we're gonna have to change it to an integer type and this won't work if the they put in like um us like a letter or like a string it has to be a number strictly so once you have all this we'll put a colon and we'll enter it in now let's create another subject called s1 for subject one um and then we're gonna just make it equal to an input so input and then we're gonna have a little colon there and we're gonna ask them what uh so what is your and then space plus sign we're gonna go with str i plus one i'm pretty sure i could just know i's an industry right so we're gonna go with str i plus one so this way it will uh every time it loops i increases by one so uh we can actually um like ask them what is your first second third fourth subject um and where the reason we put one here is because i start from zero so if we just ask them what is your zero subject that wouldn't really make sense so we have that a little a plus one there and then we're going to create another thing at the end which says subject like so a little space and now let's try running the code so press enter to continue how much subjects do you have i have four uh so let's put in four where's your first subject world sieve what is your second subject math uh science uh and maybe language arts and there you go so now once we have uh got every single thing we actually need to store the information so we're gonna append the information that we got into a list so we're going to do uh where is it subject subject list dot append and what we're going to append is s1 so let's try this out again but actually i'm gonna have it let me stop the code first okay we're gonna have it printed out so print subject list subject list like so okay let's speed run through this so i'll have three math science and worlds right and then there you go our list now has math science enrolled civ which is what they entered um so now we have stored their information somewhere we're gonna ask them again like how much points do you have for math how much points you have for signs how much points you have for world civilizations so then we can finally conduct their gpa all right so first before we start asking the questions we have to uh create a list to store their points somewhere so we're going to name this point list like so equals to a little like bracket and then we're going to have nothing in it because we're just declaring a list right now and then we're going to have another for loop for i in range and then it's the same thing int amount right here so copy and paste this in uh right here and then press enter and now we're gonna do p1 for point one and equals to uh input what is your point for and then we'll have a plus right here and then we're gonna have the subject list subject list and then we're gonna have a bracket here so this way we're gonna be calling um everything from this list starting off with zero so subject list uh i so pretend we had uh math science and world civ in the subject list we're going to have we're it's going to call out math first so what is your point for math and then we're going to have a little question mark at the end just to make it look better all right let's run this again so press enter to continue how much subjects you have i have three what's your first subject uh let's say math science and then la what is your points for math let's say 80 and there you go you can see let me add a little space there uh what is your point for signs uh 90 and then you could even put like that much too it doesn't really matter right now we have to store our their information somewhere too just like we did for our first loop so we're going to append this to point list so point list dot append and then we're going to have um p1 as the thing that's getting append so let's print out point list print point point list like so uh how much subject you have three math science oh world sieve how much what is your points for math let's say 80 to 23 50 or something like that and you can see the point list has 80 23 and 50 just like we did before and yeah that's basically how we store the information but now the main point in this little loop we have right here is that we have to convert the 80 23 50 into four three two one zero because that's the actual grade that you're gonna be using for your gpa so we're going to have a bunch of if alif statements so let's start off right here we're going to put this right through the middle so um instead of appending 80 23 and 50 we're actually going to be appending uh four three two one zero so let's put if if uh p1 p1 is greater greater than nine instead of okay so we're gonna have it so that 80 to 100 is getting a 470 to 8 70 to 79 is getting a three 60 to 69 is getting off two and then 50 to 59 is getting uh one and then from there everything below 50 is getting a zero i'm not sure if i said that correctly but um that's basically the main point of it so p1 is 79 okay is greater than 79 the reason we're putting 79 here is because if we put 80 here and then we put like p 1 is uh less than 80 on our second lift then 80 will just not be in the statement at all so we have to put 79 like so and then we're gonna put and p1 is less than 100 actually no let's just put is greater than 79 because uh let's pretend the teacher gave them extra credit so they got like 104 105 points then they would get uh they will still get four for their uh grade so if p1 is greater than 79 uh then append not append uh let's say oh yeah let's append a pen uh pointless dot append i'm gonna just copy and paste this in there actually and instead of having a pen at the end we're gonna append right here so append instead of p1 we're gonna have a pen four because this is the top grade they're gonna get and we're gonna have another a lift so alif p1 is greater than uh we're gonna now lower it down to 70 right so 69 uh and p1 is less than 81 i'm pretty sure and from then we're gonna have point list dot append you can just copy paste this one copy paste and then we're going to change this to three and we're just copy paste this one and then put it in there and then change this one to 59 59 this one to uh 61 i think or 61 yeah i think it's 61. um hopefully i didn't skip anything so uh i don't think i did okay it's a bit confusing but uh just add this one by one decrease this one by one okay and then now so we have four three let's change it to two and one is basically going to be 49 to 50 or no sorry 50 to 60 but instead we're gonna have to do a bit more confusing work so 51 like so and from then everything below 50 is going to be uh is going to be zero so everything that is less than 49 is going wait 49 or 51. i know it's 49. yeah 49 everything less than 49 point list append uh zero okay not supported of s oh okay wait sorry guys i forgot to put make this an inch because right now it's a string so it's not compatible so just copy um right here and then paste it on top of every p1 yeah i'm very sorry for this but it shouldn't be that hard to do like so oops like so there you go 65 should be in the range of two i'm pretty sure so in two we have 59 to 60 ah okay here's the error here's the error we're gonna change this to seven we're gonna change it to six and that should fix everything hopefully okay that that's where everything just went derailed okay let's try it again now once we have this we're actually going to test it out first to make sure it works so print um a point list point list once it's done so let's run this out press enter continue how much subjects let's say for math math uh what's your second subject language arts world sieve oh and then was your fourth subject uh it could be science like so and i i put something there um what is your points for math uh let's say 80 right so if we put 80 here i it has to become four so let's put 80 all right let's see and then paste it on top of every p1 yeah i'm very sorry for this but it shouldn't be that hard to do like so oops like so there you go let's try running again i'm gonna go through this one really fast okay i'm gonna go through this one very fast so oh wait i forgot that wasn't the enter one so four subjects world sieve math science and la like so what is your points for world civ i'll say 80. what's your points for math uh let's say 104 percent got extra credit and then that what's your point for science five i did really bad and then for this one let's just put at 50 right okay let's try 50. so four four zero one which is what is supposed to happen everything that is 50 i'm pretty sure um is going to be one yeah and then everything below 50 is going to be zero so i made it off the hook right there and i want to try one more thing i want to have it at 49. i want to see where that goes to so how much subjects you have let's say one uh i'll just say sdf or something sef put your point for sef um let's put 49. it should be zero okay it hasn't appended which means that we have done something wrong in the code right here so i'm going to change this to 50 and let's see if it happens again because 49 wasn't appended it should have zero in the list but it didn't how many subjects you have one sef again or ser yes sir uh 49 all right there you go we have a zero now again we have to it's trial and error encoding so we have debugged it and we have fixed the problem and after this we're gonna create a gpa calculator which is where we get all the information and then we actually calculate our gpa so let's have another variable that's final add like so equals to zero this is going to be a integer and uh from then we're gonna have another loop for i in range zero to int amount so we're going to copy into amount right here paste that in and then we're gonna we're gonna add every single thing inside of the list oh so final add final addin you spelled correctly plus equals to this is basically a fancy way of saying final ad plus um grade list where is grade list or point list plus point list uh equals to final add which is just adding like all the numbers we saw in here so if there's like four zero one this would be five it's going to add everything so add plus equals to point list point list like so and we're gonna have i in here so it cycles through everything and after that we're going to have another variable called average which will find the average of all the grades so average equals to final ad and int amount so the amount of subjects and the final ads so divide each other because this is how to find the average if you don't know you add all the numbers and then you divide it by how much numbers there were or the amount of numbers and then you should get to the average so let's print out the average after that so print average now let's actually address them so your gpa is plus average oh and you no i gotta correct average and then plus an exclamation point okay and then actually that's just a great job or something great job like so ctrl enter uh unexpected at amount where is it for iron range oh i forgot a colon right there okay let's try it again press them to continue enter how much subjects do you have uh three four i don't know four or four let's go four world civ math science oh i i miss both science i want to do that again uh i i'm a perfectionist okay restart and then run it okay press enter continue on subjects for math science world world civ and finally la la what is your point for math let's say let's say 90 or something and what is your point for science oh i did really bad in science 40. what is your points for world sieve 90 and what is your point for la let's put in like uh 65 or something all right and oh no there's something final add plus oh index out of range that's fine uh basically what happens here is because um the i actually goes out too far so we're gonna have minus one okay let me try running this again so press under continue uh how much subjects you have let's put in like um 10 or something uh i pray i put in a little thingy there okay how much subject how much subject you have three i don't know why i put 10 last time math uh science and la okay what is your point for math let's put 80 90 and 100 what is this can only concatenate str not float to str uh can only conf not str okay i forgot to um str this average right here so we have to change this to a string all right person to continue how many subjects you have for what is your first subject math science uh uh la and uh world tip like so what's your point for math let's put in 65 90 80 and five two four four zero okay that is correct um and the gpa is 2.5 we can actually fact check this so two four four zero uh that adds up to ten and ten divided by four so ten divided by four two point five right there so yep that is the working gpa calculator that we have done right there but anyways that is it for today's video i hope you enjoyed and see you next time bye
