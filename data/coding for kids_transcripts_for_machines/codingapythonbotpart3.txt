hello everybody my name is Jimmy and today I would like to continue our series on part three of our python bot in this video we're going to be covering a little bit more Basics basically functions and classes then after that we're going to be moving on to downloading the actual parts we need for our Autobot and yeah let's go ahead and get straight into it so first things first is we have to continue our functions because we have to use the return uh code basically the return code allows us to adjust the variables inside of the function so as you can see from part two this is our current two functions attack and heal basically what it does is if you heal something if to specify the character the original HP and then the amount you want to heal or attack it by so as you can see if I run this it's going to say right on the character I put in is a Pokemon got healed run is now at 110 HP however if I want to adjust the 110 HP I can't because uh as you can see it's in a text form and it's only using the local variable h so if I do want to adjust it I can now using the return variable let's go ahead and do that so instead of having H we're going to say we're going control XIs uh and then we're going to instead of printing it out we can actually we can just say return return put that in return H like so all right and now if we to run it I'm going to do a change to attack uh I'm going to go ahead and comment on the heue really quickly okay I'm going to change to attack okay let's try it out right R got attack but it didn't print it out because we returned it first so let's go ahead and do this I'm going copy this put that up there okay try it again all right now I print it out but it also has a variable H for us so now we can say like for example print H like so try it out oh what do I have to do inside a variable print AG return return AG all right guys so I remember now so basically we have to have a variable first so for example if I were to say like p uh let's say ATK ATK goes to attack blah blah blah blah and now we should have the variable H right let's try printing H after this should work no it doesn't ATK Doh no what if I do ATK h I'll just print attack then print attack and I'll not let this print so I'll delete all this okay try out okay there we go finally works so basically if we were to have if we want to print out a return function we would have to have uh a variable set to the set it to the function and then after that we print out the variable then it should print out this now we can play around with the ATK so for example we can do subtract by another 20 so it's at 70 right so now it should be at 50 there you go now you can adjust your uh your thing as much as you like and if you still want the printing stuff then you can just copy and paste it into here and it'll still work so yeah that's basically it uh and that's it for the return function let's comment this out all right let's move on to the classes so in classes it's kind of like a function but it's more wait why is it not hello one two three okay there you go so in a function I mean in a class it's like a function however it's like it it's kind of like a biography or like a description of some sort of whatever object you're trying to describe basically it's going to have different like uh types not types like different descriptions I don't know how to say it but it's going to describe the object basically so let's go ahead and set it up so pretend class uh let's rename this to Pokemon so class Pokemon uh let's and then in here after class Pokemon we got to Define in it which is basically the main core of this class Define in it and then inside of in it we're going to have self which is the the Pokemon itself and then we're going to have the different types so for example I can have the type of the Pokemon the name the let's say the HP all right let's give those three for now now we're going to save uh self. type equals to type self. name equals to name self. HP equals to HP okay so once we have that we can now set a variable let's say this P1 for Pokemon 1 equals to Pokemon and then we have our class so the name of the Pokemon is going to be uh let's see something interesting vaporean I is that that high spell vaporean I'm not sure vaporean and then type is water name oh wait I don't give the self I need to give the name okay HP let's say 110 okay and if we were to print out P1 it's going to come out a bunch of gibberish if we did it correctly okay uh okay I think I have to yeah I have to make these a string okay good so now it comes a bunch of gibbers like this this is like the the code for our class or uh Vapor right here if we want an actual sentence or an actual like word that we can understand we're going to do p1. type so what is p1's Type which is obviously vaporean I mean water and then if we do the name of it name vaporean and HP would be 110 so yeah that's basically it for classes you can have a bunch of different like uh I don't even know how to call descriptions and then you can add the descriptions yourself into here and then it'll print it out for you but yeah anyways that's it for classes now let's move on to the interesting part which is downloading and installing the packets not packets uh software we need for our actual code so let's go ahead and open up browser I'm just going to open up my Au GX because it's a it's a browser I use and the first thing we're going to be downloading is LD player so let's go ahead search that up LD player and we're going to click on download LD player right here download it l player is like something we can use to um uh to play games on mobile that aren't allowed on PC but we can play on PC because we have LD player so it's basically like a your mobile phone on a computer and now let's wait for it to install all right everybody I'm done installing L player and we can press Start uh we can just go ahead and test it around a little bit as you can see it looks like a mobile game and also it's it's enti for me right now but we can change that in the settings so we can go into settings and then we can change it really quickly where is it model no game settings uh Network microphone shortcuts other settings language English I don't know why it's still tied then uh it's okay it's probably only this picture right here let's close this up yeah it's in English as you can see search games LD store and now you can see there's a bunch of things that we can download for example Among Us braw star free fire uh pubg Etc and we can download them and actually play them so yeah that is uh that is basically what uh LD player does you can also use it for other things instead of only coding so yeah let's move on so after this I'm going to exit after this we're going to download something called autoit autoit is like a pixel finder basically when we have to press something we have to find where it is and we can use it using we can do it using autoit so we can go to the H software no actually I'm going to go out I'm I'm going to search Auto download yeah right there okay I'm just going to go down here and press download Auto it this one okay once it's done it says for us to just set it up using configuration wizard it shouldn't be that hard all right it's kind of it's uh meteor like decently size so it takes a little bit of time but anyways we're going to be using it to find colors and also our uh pixels let's go ahead and open this extract All Join folder cck yes and now we wait next I agree next run the script and then yeah just next next done all right now wait for this D set up it shouldn't take that long and it should bring you to a page that looks like like a homepage but we're not going to be actually using that one we're going to have to close and open again all right and press finish this is like the release like the help um we don't need this we can close this up now we can search for auto it like that auto it window info like so press that up as you can see we have our autoit Finder right here and we can press on this finder tool drag it to any point you like so for example if we want to press next we can drag to this point and it'll show you the position right here uh also sometimes it's important for us to know like what idle of the of the browser we're using I can't really breath this perfume in here and then there's also the class it's the Chrome widget right if we were open this up to be speed dial now which is the basically the homepage of uh Opera if you go back here it's going to be LD player like so so yeah that's basically it and now let's move on to our last one which is setting up a virtual environment a virtual environment is very important in this uh type of coding because if we install some things that are like really big we don't want them to be col lettering our computer and also if we don't like if we do something wrong in our virtual environment it doesn't affect our main frame so it's wouldn't be that drastically like impactful however if we set but uh so we should set up a r environment to do that let's go ahead and set it up I'm going to open my folder I'm going to go to my coding oh my God coding Python and then we're going to go to python bot which is the thing we made and then we have I mean we go python python bot as you can see bunch of these guys are still here which I don't know why um I already moved them inside of a teaching but I'm just go ahead and delete these ones yes okay so my teaching F folder is what we got so far part one part two and then the functions thing that we made in part two but now we're going to be going to our big folder and we're going to be uh making a folder in here which is a roast environment so we're going to copy the path and we're going to go to CMD we're go uh CD which is ch change directory change it to this directory and we can do di really quickly to check the folders inside if they're matching as you can see they are high cache and teaching like so all right and now we can also now we can do this Command right here called uh python SLV for virtual I guessing slm sorry and then bend like that uh and then our virtual environment name which I'm going to set python Autobot like so press enter it's going to load a little bit because it's creating it right now as you can see python Autobot has appeared in our folder and we're going to wait until it's done as it comes with a new line that we that way we know it's done all right it doesn't take that long there you go and inside of our python Autobot folder there's going to be three main um folders uh however the one we're going to be looking at is the scripts one which is the activate right right here this activate will allow us to activate our uh our virtual environment and in order to do that we're going to have have to go inside of that folder so we're going to do uh scripts right scripts scrip wait no not scripts what is it we go out all the way python Autobot first so python Autobot backs slash scripts back slash uh activate and the way I'm doing this is just pressing the first letter then pressing Tab and it should come up whatever we have uh so let's press enter as you can see if this low parentheses if these low parentheses come up that means we're in the virtual environment we can do pip list to check the things we have in here the pp packages we only have two we have PP IP itself and also setup tools uh we can install like P game or something to just show you that works so pip install Pi game like that installing collected P game and then blah blah blah blah list again uh as you can see we have P game now now if you were to deactivate this so just press just type deactivate like so it's going to kick us out of the virtual environment like that and we to do a pip list here pip list we got a bunch more do we oh I don't think we actually have any because I factory reset my computer and all my PP packages are gone so that's kind of sad but before I used to have like a whole bunch um just imagine there's a lot of pp packages here all right but the main point I'm trying to say is that they're different so they are I have none in my original folder but I have two inside of the virtual environment itself so yeah that's basically it uh for this um lesson we have to have a virtual environment LD player Auto IT classes and return functions and that's it it's pretty simple this lesson I hope you enjoyed it and see you the next one bye
