hello everybody my name is Jimmy and today I will be showing you part four of our python bot today we're going to be doing some image recognition as well as some other things and we're actually going to be starting our uh bot tracking ability today and recognition ability as well so yeah let's go ahead and get right into it first things first let's go ahead and open vs code so visual Studios Visual Studio like that open it up okay and then this is our old code let's just contrl n to create a new one close this up uh just press just press save all right and we're going contr s this one as well and we're going to go inside our python bot in here py Autobot no wait no teaching uh yeah I'm just going to go into here I'm just save it I guess it's going to be main.py okay and then now we'll di to see where we are okay we're still outside so let's CD into our folder so I'm I'm going to go grab our folder F our folder really quickly all right so in order to copy the code we just go into our uh where is it coding python right here and just grab this oh python bot and just grab this like so contrl C CD bam enter there you go we are inside of our folder right now which means we can go and activate our virtual envirment so let's go ahead and do that uh I kind of forgot the lines actually it's been quite a while since I recorded the last one so let's what is it python Autobot uh scripts activate Okay python Autobot so python oh python Autobot script activate like so press enter and if there's a green thingy right here that means it's activated and we're good to go all right so now after done this we're going to be importing some uh elements or some libraries that we need in order to let our uh our bot recognize the images so let's go ahead and install them all of our images can be I mean all of the libraries can be found on p.org which is the main uh Storage Point for python packages and yeah let's go ahead and do it so I think it's it's called open CV CV SL python 4.8 let's try it out let's see there you go we can use this one this is the newest version so let's go ahead and do this let's copy right here and then we're going to go into our Visual Studio code we're going to paste it into here press enter and it will install itself just wait a little bit there you go it's almost wait wait until it's done it's not done yet it's still installing there you go now it's done now if we were to do pip list we would also find it pip list like so as you can see we have num uh and then open CV right there okay all right now once we're done with all this importing stuff we can now put it into our code and in order to check that it works we're going to say import CV2 which is the library just did uh we just had installed as see CV all right this makes so that when we type we can type it very uh shortly so we don't have to you know type the entire thing is it called just copy open cv. python this work let CV2 error no module found CV2 all right maybe it's let's save it again and see if it works because it should have a CV too I don't know why it's not having CV C CSV I don't think it's CSV no let's try CV2 but why can't I no modu found CB2 there must be a fix right okay now find mod CV2 and using open CV uh and try get a f message okay so how do I fix it Konda update Konda PP install okay that's what I did though let's try it out install op TV oh wait am I not in my wa cancel X well it's done but I think it's because I wasn't in my virtual environment so let's try it again let's go into a virtu I don't know why I deactivated yeah I'm outside as you can see I'm outside uh okay well let's try to go back if I were to do pip list right now it should be outside right yeah I'm outside so I'm going to try I'm just going to ignore that and try to go back so CD into our old folder which is python Autobot right here bam and then scripts wait what oh I go python Autobot first python Autobot scripts activate Okay and now it should work save run okay no wait let CS it's still CSV CV2 come on CV2 there must be a CV2 was there no CV2 did it work oh it did work yeah there's no okay there's no errors even though it's like a squiggly line I feel like it's fine so let's import numpy now so import numpy or nump as NP as NP all right now let's try running this all right that also works so let's try again just to make sure sure oh no I'm not inside my thing anymore CD CD into this I don't know why it keeps kicking me out CD okay uh python Autobot script SL activate Okay so I'm going to keep it here it seems like it works so I'm fine with that as long as it as long as it's fine I just don't know what these two errors are python um I don't know it's fine okay let's go and now grab an image online to grab to let our uh thingy recognize it so let's go ahead do that I'm just going to grab this okay so our image could be of like I think we're going to have like pieces maybe chest pieces do chest pieces chess nope not not chess.com chess bam images let's go find a chest piece uh this one maybe what else what else can I find I want like chest pie sand out from each other so make sure distinct you know what it's fine I'll just okay let me scroll down for a little bit okay I think I just use this one actually May's fine yeah I think I'll use this one okay there's two might get confused though uh this one it's huge find a good size one yeah this one's actually kind of nicely sized but it has the water mark I don't think that matters though this one oh this one's pretty good um I just grab the king or something all right we'll save this one as like chest piece chest yes oh it's w no seriously all right we'll have to convert it now I I hate when websites make it D like WG because like all it does is just delays our process but doesn't really like it doesn't really do much you can still convert it really easily just it's inconvenient oh my all right we converted it let's download this all right and let's download save Jazz chess. jpg okay let's go to our downloads okay close this no wait that's not the one okay you're kidding me saving M jazz jazz okay now we're going to no I I just opened Val it's fine I just delete this okay um D I'm not restarting am I all right so once we have our thing installed now we're going to put it into our code all right so first things first let's go ahead open our folder I'm going to copy this piece right contr X I'm going to go into our coding python python bot and create a new image I mean folder called image like so paste this inside after that close this up go into a visual studio code and then we're going to say chessor IMG equals to CV do image read or IM red and then we're going to say image IMG SL chess. jpg which is our folder which is our file that we just put in comma STV dot I'm read again underscore any color this will generate us an array which US humans will not understand only robots will which uh which is fine because as long as robot understands then the final product we should understand so we're going to print out just to check yeah there you go the bunch of arrays have appeared and this is what we want but I don't know why it's 255 for all them maybe we uh maybe our folder name doesn't have a JPG wait let me just add it just to be sure okay let's try again uh oh there's none now um okay can't open this anymore just. jpg save try again what uh I think it open through here though no there's the Explorer open folder images uh let's just select folder python Autobot okay okay yes let's open our main okay uh and our images oh it's do jpg twice okay I'm going rename this too just dopg okay there you go I thought it was broken it wasn't can you just like yeah okay there okay that's good all right now once we have this uh we should be okay yeah I think we're fine but let's again I don't know why we have to activate our virtual environment so much it doesn't stay for some reason let's go ahead python Autobot again python Autobot script SL activate all right all right so now once we did this we're going to now find um where we want to locate it so as you can see in our chest piece maybe I want I want the king part right here so I'm going to open up my folder I'm going to go to coding python python bot images grab this chest piece right here and I'm going to crop it out so I'm going to grab the editor tool and I'm going to get the crop okay I'm just going to shink it down to this part right here like so okay and now I'll click save options and I'm going say save as copy uh go back into our coding python python bot images save this as night like so all right it's not a knight it's a king what name is Knight all right King okay once we have a name it should appear here and there you go all right so in we can just copy paste this twice oh chest image change it to something else change it to king. image King _ image and kingore gpg okay uh then we can print King just to make sure okay like so enter invalid syntax python uh python what what syntax what line line one coding so this is my folder right coding python okay we're going to close it we run it again there you go okay now it works some reason and our virtual environment has been kicked out yet again guys uh oddly so let's go back python script activate now run it okay there there it works but the thing that's bothering me is why is it 255 maybe it doesn't matter I'm not sure but yeah let's let's print type okay now is up higher rate but still I don't I don't know why it's not showing up different numbers it's all like the same color I don't know it's kind of weird to me but maybe I'm just overthinking it a little bit bit anyways let's go ahead and continue all right so now once we've read our images we're going to find them so we're going to go ahead and create some a varable called result equal to cv. match template sorry template match template chessor image comma kingcore image comma cv. TM underscore CCF normed like so and now we're going to do underscore comma Max comma underscore comma Max locate this is going to locate our images equals to cv. min max lock like so uh parentheses result all right so this will locate the image and tell how accurate is let's print out Max and Max lock we'll print out Max lock first I guess contr c control+ v and delete this little part okay print it all right so it has located our picture uh at 87 382 which I'm pretty sure is accurate right 87 is the X so it's around like here and then 382 is really high up so it's around here yeah I think it's pretty good I think it's pretty accurate it has a 99 okay that's basically 100 100% like guarantee so yeah that's pretty good all right so now we're going to have uh it draw a border right here so it going to it's going to show where it found our image so let's go ahead and do that we're going to first off create a threshold this way if our accuracy is below this threshold then we might not show it because it might be an inaccuracy but since our accuracy is pretty high right now I'm going to set it as like 85 just in case and I'm going to say if maxcore uh is greater or equal to the threshold threshold then we're going to say top left which is the starting point of our of our which is where it locates the image equals to Max lock height height equals to Knight king sorry kingore shape zero and then width equals to kingcore image. shape one which is the width and the height the bottom right equals to top left zero that's an O zero uh plus width comma top left and then one right here then comma I mean plus height all right this will basically uh create the brain for the bottom right we're going to cv. rectangle this is going to draw it now rectangle chest doore image comma top left which is starting point uh bottom right ending point and now we're going to set the color I'm going to have it as uh blue so I'm going to do 51 comma 51a 2555 wait this is blue or red I'm not sure maybe let's just search it up uh I'm just going to go search it up right here bam what color is that that's none of the maps no okay it's blue yeah okay we're good so make it blue and I'm going to set the thickness now so I say thickness equals to 4 we going to say line type equals to cv. line line eight let's say in line eight yeah all right now let's create a new line this will show it now so we're going to cv. um show uh result result like so comma chess images tv. weight key uh that's it and then we're going to destroy all windows once we're done so destroy all windows like so now let run it hey there you go that's pretty good as you can see it located our image right here but it's red red is fine it doesn't really matter okay so it's showing us where it found our image which is very accurate to where we actually made it as you can see we got this and got this and it showed us this so that's pretty good that's pretty good and I'll put some text over to make sure we know what it is all right so now let's go ahead and create our um text first off I'm going to comment stuff out so I'm going to say this one show so just to make sure me and the future knows what we're doing this one will draw draw this one will set start uh set how you call it set width and height okay there we go there we go and now before it shows I'm going to put some text so hash text like that and we're going to say font equals to cv. font Hershey Simplex like so position equals to top left wa I'm supposed to top left uh zero I can't really type today um comma top left one like so okay we're going to say fine size equal to 1 color equal to 51 comma 255 comma 51 like so say cv. putut text chat images comma this be a text I'm going say King comma position uh comma font comma font size comma color comma thickness like so these are all the parameters that we need I'm say this goes to two let's run it there you go okay um it's green let's make it blue I mean make it red do one like that that should be red or no oh wait no it's blue I sorry I meant blue yeah okay it's good but the font sucks so let's change the font really quickly uh maybe this one's bad change it font Hershey Hershey Hershey complex like that okay that's a lot better um okay I'll leave it like that so that's pretty good all right so now if we were to look at this uh as you can see it does not it's not centered completely which it's kind of annoying so I'm going to make it so that it codes up a little bit and goes to the center we can do this by adjusting the position right here the top left top I mean top left top left uh oh I think I did something wrong here uh top left oh wait never mind I I I did it correctly top left one meaning the width all right I mean meaning the height sorry so yeah this is pretty good uh we can adjust the height by adding to here say adding by 25 may be too much let's see that actually lowers it um so subtract subtract 25 okay that's a bit too high I'm going to say 15 a bit too high again let say 10 all right and close it 10 uh is it not showing anymore 10 is good I like like 10 okay okay chill chill chill hey okay I understand man chill okay um so we have minus 10 we're going to plus plus let's say 20 20 like so uh it should be in the middle too far I'm going say 15 yeah that's pretty good so yeah as you can see I put in the middle and it looks a lot nicer so yeah this is how to make that simple code contrl s to save this and that's it for this video if you want to recognize more stuff for example like you want to recognize this Knight or this bishop or this queen right here then you just go ahead and take a screenshot or crop it out then adjust the change the name right here and you should be all good so yeah that's basically it and I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful this is the first the starting part of our bot it will go much more later on so stick around and find out how far it goes anyways see you guys later bye
