what somebody sent me a text from line at six a.m in the morning man what does people have against sleeping what does it say remember to do your python video yeah i know i even remind myself to do my python video wait that gave me an idea guys so today i'm going to be communicating between python and line so i'm going to use python to send texts into line thanks whoever sent this to me but gotta text you back later right now i gotta do the video roll the intro oh hello my name is jimmy and today i'm going to be showing you how to communicate between python and line so first of all you would need to import requests import requests is um to how to communicate from the data from the internet and uh now for these from tdk import and from tk inter import ttk um this is the standard you need to in order to create that popup thing and these three you can just copy it down this is for the this is line configuration and you might be wondering like what is token why did you do like this well in order to make this work really you have to go to this website right here this website notify and then dash bot dot line dot me slash en slash so yeah this is the website you need to go in it's the line website and log into here and then put in your email and password then scroll down and should um find uh generate token then do that then click copy after that you can finally paste in your um token in here in here and then after that uh you got all this information down this one you can just copy from me except for token and finally after that you go to um write down gui equal to tk we're starting to make our main window now so gi geometry uh 500 times 300 i think you should know what that is to create how um big the windows popup screen supposed to be and gui.title to name the window screen you could name it like uh line or something and then now um define line two which is to message from uh how you call it from your python to line this is the code right here um message equal to v message underscore dot get print sending now plus message so this is like to notify you that they're sending it and message equals to yeah you could forgery yourself as like what um steve jobs and then do this and then plus message so you could disguise yourself with anybody and just do it okay r equals to request that post yeah all this stuff and that's the defining line two which is going to be useful later on so the underscore message you go to string bar e1 ttk dot entry gui text variable yeah basically all that stuff to put make the um the column of the high call the the input and then for the button uh this is the code for the button right here this is to name the button you can name it whatever you want i'm gonna name it send actually and the command you go to line two which is over here so we're going to be using that once they click the button it's going to have line two okay perfect and ipad x equal to 20 and ipad y equals 20 is how big the um button is supposed to be so yeah ui main loop is to keep on repeating the program so you won't have to click run over and over again so that's the um program let me run it for you so right now i put in my um my token behind the scenes and uh as you can see my page popped up and this is the text box for me to um put in my uh like uh messaging so pretend i put in or let's actually just say this is from python like this and then we click send and sending now this is for python and then here you can see um my phone or my dad's phone uh there is the message under here steve jobs this is from python okay you see that yeah so you could do whatever you want with it really and uh it's going to be a lot of fun experimenting with it so yeah use your code use this code however way you want so yeah see you next video bye
