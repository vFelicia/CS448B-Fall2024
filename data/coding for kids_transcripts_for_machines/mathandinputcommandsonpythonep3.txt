hi my name is jemmy and today i'm going to be showing you some simple math commands and the functions of inputs so let's get started with the functions of input so functions of input okay so it's pretty um fun to do it because you actually get to interact with the program instead of just watching it just like um display like just type out and print stuff so you could actually like enter stuff in as like the player or the game tester so yeah let me just show you how it works first of all type in input and then these parentheses after that um you can like ask questions to like enter your name here and then colon like that so now it's gonna do is it's gonna ask you enter your name here so you can enter like your name jemmy click enter and the program is done however if you want to use the name to do something else you could set um the input as a variable like this after that it will store the name into the variable called name and it will use it for something else so we could just do print name like this which will make it print the player's name so jeremy wrong place jimmy right here and then it prints out jimmy but it's kind of boring so i'm gonna make it actually um actually like respond as an actual human so like nice to me oops nice to me you jam oops um and then after this right here what we do is we grab the quotation marks but we're still inside the parentheses and what you do is you put plus and then plus what plus the name so once you add the name it's gonna look like real like nice to meet you and then um jimmy doggo whatever let me just delete this right here i accidentally typed it okay there you go um but let me try enter your name here jeremy nice to meet you jimmy also if you want like an um a punctuation at the end you can just put another um addition sign do some friends um quotation marks and put it right in the middle so like nice to meet you gemmy with an um exclamation point i think it's gonna look more exciting oh why is it always keep on printing in here jeremy enter nice to meet you gemmy like that and then it will make it more sophisticated now let's take it one more step further and make them enter their last name too so let's name this variable l name for last name um and enter your last name here and then we leave them a space after this why don't we um work on our program a little so for our last name we need to have their first name space last name and then um exclamation point right so uh let's go back to this step where there's just nice to meet you jimmy uh we click uh um we click addition okay quotation marks and then space it out so it will have a gap between name um your first name and your last name and then addition l name for their last name plus again quotation mark exclamation point so now it's gonna look more um more real uh so enter your name here jammy doggo something like that nice to meet you jimmy doggo as you can see it's more um more like a human right so yeah this is uh the functions of input it's pretty fun um and yeah you could expand on and make a whole story of it like and then you could ask um like this input and then we could make the robot ask how's your day how's your day and then um let them um enter like like pretend respond oh respond right here like that let's just test that out okay jemmy again why does it need to be over there so over here gemmy and then like doggo and nice to meet you jamie doggo how's your day and everything for like great and you can make a whole story of that so that's why it makes it more exciting um because you can enter and like keep on continuing so yeah that's the function of input okay now let's keep on hashtag to make them comment because we're going to expand our knowledge on math commands so let's label our topic math command enter and then um what we're going to do is we're going to set two variables for the each factors so the first factor is going to be named x equals to let's say 10 and then y equals to three okay i'm going to be showing you a couple different math um commands in python which is pretty cool um you could do a bunch of equations with them such as addition so let's just say print um parentheses quotation so the sum and then we put equal sign up here we put space comma space okay and then we do x plus y as we all know sum is um the answer to addition now let's try it for subtraction shall we so enter again print it out sum instead of sum we do what uh yeah it's a difference right yeah difference is for um subtractions change this to x minus y copy this so we have addition subtraction both down now let's um change this one to multiplication so product okay and then x times y like that copy it again enter now for the division which is quotient quotient no that doesn't look right oh there we go um and then x slash y so here we are with the four most simple math command and let me just show you how it works okay so the first one is 13 x yes 10 plus 3 13 difference 10 minus 3 equals 7 yes product 10 times 3 equals 30 and then dividing 3.3 yeah okay and it rounds off nice um but what if we don't want this whole long stubborn decimal point so we could do another way to round down the decimal points um using this method so rounded quotient whoops keep on forgetting okay rounded quotient equals to um oh wait remember your quotation guys don't forget because if you do it won't be good okay something like this nice and then space comma space x double slash y there we go and it'll round off this whole chunk and it'll just be three okay let's see yep there you go three okay nice now next one is what is our next one let's do how about exponents yeah okay let's do exponents so exponents it's simple um all you gotta do do that star shape two times which is for multiplication uh but for multiplication it's only once this one is twice so let's set this as exponents equal to this and let's copy that let me see what other one we do oh yeah remainders so 3 goes into x how much time three times right and um three times three equals nine and then ten minus nine equals one which means that there's one remainder left so if my calculations are correct this last one should be equal to one so let's label it remainders and then let's um for inside here what we're going to do is we're going to do um a percentage sign which makes it uh make a remainder uh so let's just clear this terminal and then let's play it okay there we go so the sum thirteen seven thirty three point three two three three rounded round quotient equals three exponents a thousand yes that makes sense and remainder c goes to one according my calculations it was correct okay so this is um the simple lesson for today i hope you found something helpful from this lesson um it was pretty fun for me to uh like share my knowledge about this so i hope you guys enjoyed it uh leave a like if you did don't remember remember to subscribe i almost said don't remember to subscribe and uh yeah see you next video bye
