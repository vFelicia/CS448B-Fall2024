hello guys my name is um lists in python shell right now we're not in visual studios anymore we're in python shell you should be able to have it in your computer if you downloaded um in my first video about python how to set it up so if you search up python there should be um idli which is the shell so just click on it and it pops up like this and now you can start typing so lists is kind of like a writing construct too um you can delete stuff you can like um pull stuff from it and yeah you can do a bunch of stuff with list let's just see what it does first so first of all is to set the list right so let's pretend we have something like what do you keep in your um pretend closet okay so we're gonna set closet as a list so the closet list would be like this and then there's going to be what clothes yeah um what else books maybe if you like store them in behind the closet uh choose okay wait remember your single quotes shoes and what else toys toys like this and there you go that's now the closet has um is a list and it has clothes books choose and toys in it so what if we want to um add something to it so we would do like this uh closet dot append and then um put your thing into it so i'm going to put what else is there um jackets okay so that there we go now we added jack to the list and why don't we print the um the closet now which is the list don't get confused okay let's print the list which we named closet clothes books toys choose clothes books choose toys and jackets there we go um this is now the list of closets if we want however to get one specific one we would do like this um print um closet and little brackets like this and what would we want so here's a list close books choose so let's just do shoes which is number three like so wait no she was in number two because it started from zero okay let me see okay uh oh i forgot i typed it wrong print um remember your spelling is really really um sensitive so remember to spell correctly to this and like this choose there you go remember it's just from zero okay so it's zero one two three four and there you go it's choose now what if we want to remove something from the list like pretend they took it out okay so you're going to school right um and then you take out your clothes to go to school your uniforms so we would do a closet dot remove and then what do you want to remove right so we would do uh we would do it like have a parenthesis and then we would say what number we want to remove just like in our printing so remove closet closet um which one zero right okay um now we print it out and it should be gone print closet parentheses closet like so book shoes toys and jackets no more clothes because we took them out right we removed them okay moving on next one is if we want to add again but this time it's going to be in a different code so it's alternative between append so closet um dot insert okay insert um what boom we're gonna insert closed again so we took them out now we're putting them back in closet did i do something wrong i think i did wait uh sorry guys um we need to insert where we want to uh like put this back so pretend this one like needs to go to specific place not like a pen they're different actually a pen is to just put them like behind everything but um insert you can actually control where it's going to be placed so first you have to do it like this like when you want to place it back to pretend there's like four five boxes in the closet marked as zero one two three and four so we took the clothes out of um box number zero right so we're going to put them back in box number zero which means that we're gonna put zero comma um where is it zero comma close so now we're going to put the closed back in box zero like so whoops got remember those single quotes like so and now after this we will click enter and we'll print it out print closet sorry for my cad back there closet and then there you go there's clothes book shoes toys and jackets everything is in the same position again and after this we're going to um we're going to show that you can actually reverse it around i'm not sure why this is a command but it somehow is for some reason if you want it to be more advanced or something then it's just the same thing as removing but however i mean printing out a specific um call a specific uh item but this one is i don't know why you put a negative number on it and that negative number would be like pretend you put like zero right if you didn't put um a minus sign in front of it then it's going to be closed but if you put a minus sign in front of zero it's going to be jacket weird right let's check it out print um closet this subtract zero like so and now it should be jackets clothes what wait one sec for some reason it doesn't work with zero but let's just try doing with one maybe one would work for some reason zero doesn't work oh because negative zero is still zero i forgot about that negative zero without a minus sign is still zero so what if we try one negative one and one is different there we go it's jackets oh i get it um for this um thing they don't start at zero instead they start at one so yeah listen learn negative zero is the same thing um it's going to be closed no matter what but if you want to do negative one it's going to be jackets so it's starting at negative one if my theory is correct negative five should be closed again boom yeah it's close okay so it starts at one if you want to do it fancy like this not sure why would anybody want to do it but apparently it's a thing so you guys could use if you want if you want to be more advanced now moving on to um we did uh printing specific one sorry my tongue specific ones and now why don't we start doing something else so since we've been starting to do specific ones after that what was it let me see oh yeah um printing your uh how do you call it printing your um hi like you're gonna label something instead of toys you could rename it to something else okay so pretend like this we're going to do my item okay equals to close close and then no no closet sorry closet um this what was it toys right yeah closet three which is toys and like this my item equals closet item number three click enter now print my item oh sorry we got a parenthesis around it parenthesis my item so there you go toys so you can rename your um items in your list you can rename them to something else by setting a variable and then setting it to the item in the list and yeah that's how you rename something in a list moving on next to um here we are okay so we're going to just change something we're going to change something in the list um i'm not sure but this one is actually going to be more cooler than the other strategy it's going to be like the same thing but instead of having to do all that my list like my item like set it to closet number three and then print closet number three this one's more easier so garage sorry not garage but i'm getting mixed up closet okay closed it um and we're going to just do something like this closet number one okay and we're going to change it closet number one here we are i'm going to equals to what closet one is choose so we're going to do sneakers how about that sneakers okay more specific and at the same time still the same thing so they took out the shoes and put in sneakers so now we print out the closet it should be instead of shoe sneakers um let's wait one second print close it there we go oh parentheses ah keep on forgetting parentheses close it bam there we go clothes sneaker shoes toys what oh i did i change it did i do anything no it didn't oh so this is adding a game really is it one sec guys closet one equals sneakers so we put in sneakers in section number one oh i get it so we did that and it just inserted in okay it doesn't change it inserts it okay nice moving on to which one is it moving on to oh this one getting a little fancy here moving on to print len closet which i'm pretty sure but let's just check okay print print and then here when blend and then closet and what should be printed by number three how about that let's try it number three then let's just try printing lens right so there we go and it's five this is gonna be how much it is in here if my theory is correct then if we remove um wait no no it wasn't removed right yeah print so we gotta remove our thing so if we just copy from here where it was or are you remove um remove guys help and here we r so we're going to remove it okay so we're going to remove it like this but we can't find it so let's just type it remove um wait no closet closet dot remove uh which ones closet dot remove five okay so let's see okay so it doesn't work like this let's see why okay i'm just going to copy up from up here but my program doesn't like me so it doesn't give me remove it doesn't show me remove either so they took out the clothes right right here closet remove oh i need to put closet okay go bam bam and then print the closet then i mean print length closet okay enter four there you go it's the amount of um things are in the list okay moving on after len is now we're going to create another um how do you call it another list it's called it's going to be called uh the alphabet i'm just going to write alpha no actually alpha is hard to spell how about just write capital a okay capital a works and then we're going to set this list like this and we're going to align them in alphabetical order so let me just i o t h okay okay like this and now after this we're going to what i didn't even do anything yet i just said as a list why can't i do that okay let's see so and for some reason oh i forgot here we go again jimmy forgiveness we have to put the single quotes in there okay so now it should work bam good okay now we're going to print a and it should be like this right but if we say print sort a what if it's like this oh sorry i wrote the wrong code i'm not supposed to say print sort we're supposed to say a dot sort okay there we go and we're going to just do that like so add some parentheses enter and then we're going to print a let's see what it does boom there you go it adds a line a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y and z yeah there we go that works and now after this we're going to um after this we're going to reverse it so it's going to be z to a z2a okay g2a what's that gonna be um so we're gonna print now we're going to do sort so a dot sort and then here we're going to put reverse reverse equals true there we go enter and we're gonna print hey there we go and just switched around completely so yeah that's um the reversing and now we're going to do one last code this one is to temporarily um sorted from alphabetical order so we're going to temporarily do it so print this one is the one i got confused on sorted a there now it's going to temporarily switch it but however if you print it look if you actually print a okay it's still switched around so this is just temporarily to get you like the view of what it's actually is if it's like alphabetically aligned but actually it's going to be like this so yeah sorted is to temporarily do it and that's it for today guys see you next video bye
