hello everybody my name is Jimmy and today I will be showing you how you can make your own python bot that will automate your games for you so for example this aim trainer right here if I were to play it by myself as you can see I have horrible aim I cannot even press it and uh in order to fix this I decided to make my own python bot that can easily do like this which is to track all the dots for you and even if I'm pretending to be the body self or blame anyway is this you can automate your games using this python bot which would track objects and click it for example like uh like Resort like not Resort games like mobile games those on where you have to press people in order to collect money or something uh it you can use it for a variety of things and today's is going to be episode one which is where I'm going to lay out the basics and teach you some of like um how to install stuff and the basics of python basically if you don't want to if you already know how to do these things you don't have to to do it for example in this video I'm going to be uh talking about printing IFL statements concatenation commenting different types of variables and math and python as well as arrays so if you don't if you already know all these things then you can go ahead and skip to the next episode where I might be making I might be starting to make a bot or I might still be laying out some Basics but anyways let's get started first things first let's go ahead and install Visual Studio codes which is where we're going to be uh which is what we're going to be using to code it's a python editor which means me that it edit python so let's go ahead search that Visual Studio code like that go to download right here and then download for Windows uh I'm not using a Mac or Linux so I don't know if it will work the same way as Windows but anyways just press this big blue button okay and now once you press in here it's going to ask you to set up press save all right now just open it up uh I accept next just press next next wait okay next and then in here yeah just press next all right neck and install like that and that's it wait for it to install and then we're done all right after it's done installing we just press finish and it opens up okay once we've got to this welcome menu right here we're going to go to our extensions and we're going to search for pyth well I I already searched it up beforehand but if you didn't search python press enter Then you see the first thing comes up this one press install I already have it installed so mine comes up uninstall and after you're done installing python you want to go to here and search python indent like so is this guy press on it and press install this will basically make it a lot easier for you to type python as you can see it just automatically indents it for you which is a lot easier than having to tab press tab so yeah let's go back to our Explorer all right okay now let's go create go ahead and create a file control n okay let's close these two up I'm going to save this into a folder which I'll know how to do coding Python and let's just make our uh python robot python bot all right and I'll save this as uh part one. py make sure it's py or else it won't work okay now we can use control+ to zoom in it's bit too much all right there all right once we zoomed in we're going to now start our coding so first things first what we want to do let me close this up is printing so printing is quite simple actually all we got to do is print hello world this is the probably the easiest command in all of programming in order to run this we press control B no that's that's for Sublime Text we press over here uh and oh I think we got to go go here first first then choose where is it editor no wait do we select python yeah just python PR oh python not installed what I already inst python all right it looks like I haven't installed python on this computer which is kind of weird oh maybe it's because I factory res my computer like a few weeks ago that's why I don't have python but anyways okay I'll download python while we're waiting all right now python is installed uh so yeah let's go ahead and try it again uhoh that one there you go I press play as you can see it now works hello world all right that's our basic print command I'm going to actually make a little heading going be print print okay uh and in printing we we can do a lot of stuff with it we can do a lot of things with it Bas actually so let's take for example print a variable so we're going to set uh x equals to in strings rabbit like that we can say print X and it will say rabbit see rabbit okay uh now with printing when you print uh a string you have to have it in a single code like what I did like this or you can have it in a double quote like this all right so it doesn't really matter as long as you have these two things however if you want to print a number that's also possible like 1 two three like that but now it's a type of an integer not a string if you were to make this a string it also typed out the same thing but it would be a different type if that makes sense okay now what if we were to type letters that weren't in a in a string it wouldn't be possible because you can't really contain letters as integers or any type of number that's why you can't print it however if we put that in a string I mean in a quotation mark then it'll work so yeah that's basically printing very simple very easy to learn and we're going to add on to printing later with something called concatenation which is basically adding a text with another text or a text with an integer or the other way around so yeah all right our next one is going to be about let's see my little chart if else so if else like so all right now most of you probably know what if else does but if you don't let me paint a picture using paint okay so pretend you have uh all right so you go on a bike all right this is a bike okay this is a bike and then you on your bike like that okay and then you're headed towards uh let's say let's say a bush all right so let's me change the color towards a bush and then okay you head it towards a bush but you don't know what's inside the bush right it could be something like spiky or something like dangerous so you say if if Bush let me just write a bush draw Bush okay if bush has something spiky inside of it like I don't know some spikes I don't know if there would be spikes but if there's a something inside the bsh if there's something spiky inside the bush then uh wait let me can I like crop could I select okay there's something inside the bush Spike inside the bush uh then go then go away from the bush so don't go so yeah don't go inside the bush all right so don't go inside the bush there's something Spike inside don't go inside the bush however if there's uh else this is uh let's see if there is something inside the bush then don't go inside else go inside the bush all right so inside the bush if there's nothing Spike inside all right so this is the IFL statement right here it's kind of complicated another way of representing this is if we have to go outside and if it's raining then don't go outside else go outside if it's not raining so yeah it's B basically that pretty simple okay so let's go ahead and write that so let's set off a variable first so let's pretend we have let's do something about money so we have money equals to we have five money right now five units of cash and we're going to buy something so let's say we're going to buy something that cost 5 un an Apple so if we say if money equals to five then what then say print I bought Apple why is so big uh bot else oops else print to poort okay so that's basically how the if else Works money equals to five if money equal equals to five you say bot else it says too poor let's try it out it says bot right here let me just Del this really quickly all right as you can see it says bot and if we were to change money to less than like five like four for example it would say too poor and if we were to change it more than five like seven it would also say too poor this is a problem because we do have more money right so it doesn't really make sense in order to fix this we're going to say if money is equal or greater than five okay let's try it again and we say bot there you go it's quite simple if L statements like that uh so yeah that's basically IFL statements all right the next one we're going to be looking at is concatenation which is what I was talking about in the beginning so in order to concatenate something uh we have to have something to print first so hasht conat Nation all right let's say print uh I don't like these things where it's so huge go back up a little bit all right print print print oh my name is my name is name is blank and we going to say plus which is to concatenate uh let's let's make a variable called name name equals to input what is your name I'm pretty sure all of you know what input is input is basically allowing the user to type in something in order for the program to receive it so my name is plus name plus exclamation point like that all right let's try it out the reason I have a space here is because plus doesn't add a space so yeah what is your name I'm going to say Jimmy my name is Jimmy there you go now let's say if we don't have this space What would happen jimy oops not there it says my name is Jimmy like together doesn't have a space right in order to fix this if you don't want to add a space and you think it's annoying we're going to add an Anderson like that this will add a space for you but it could be annoying when you have like the ending with a oh wait what oh oh no okay got to have an integer so let's say I'm 14 years old I am I am 13 I am 13 all right that's fine what is your name doesn't really matter right now SN in huh well I guess ERS doesn't work with this type maybe I got confused but yeah if you have an end sense usually it doesn't it adds an extra space I think I'm just doing something wrong here but anyways yeah let's move on there's another thing called an F string which basically uh basically is a and which is oh my gosh which is uh concatenation but more advanced so what we want to do is we put F in front of our string put it like that then after that we put uh my name is like normal and instead of having to put like go space and plus and then plus again we can just put these little curvy brackets put a variable inside which is name an exclamation point and it automatically prints it out like this it's really cool what is your name my name is dog my name is dog there you go it's really easy it's called an F string so yeah these are the methods of concatenation we're going to be using in this project okay let's move on to the next one next one is going to be uh different types of variables this one's not that important to learn but it is quite interesting different types of variables like so all right so we have uh let's say we have a variable a a a equals to a number so we can to say print print type A this is so that we're going to show what type A is I think we need to yeah I'm going to I'm going to put all these in a I almost forgot to comment all these actually so we're going to comment them no wonder they've been typing so much like that and we're going to comment from the top there you go all right let's try it out class int there you go class int which is the type of uh type variable of a now if we were to change it to 14.1 it's going to be a float a float is basically an integer but with an additional like uh with an additional with a decimal even if we do 14.0 it's still going to be a float because we have a point right there so yeah now we do it 14. 0.0 it's going to be eror right yeah it's be error doesn't exist so let's now make a something that we know uh let's say three like that it's going to be a string now what if you put a number inside of us inside of quotation mark it's still going to be a string because it's inside of quotation mark As I told you earlier now what if we did 1 + one what would that be it would be an INT but if we do 1 plus one J now it be return to a complex so those are basically the four main types of uh variables that we know in Python and we're not going to be using all of them mostly strings integers and floats not really complex that much but a complex could be useful for example like I think this how it works J to one right yeah and then if you to plus that let's print a which is a oh a is just one plus J doesn't really matter unless you do this unless you do this right wait any objects not callable one uh okay oh I think we have to put in here and go one plus one times J like that okay let me just delete this like this and now it should work type okay there's so much errors going on here there you go now it works because uh we can't just print a without having a and we can't put multiplies I mean we can't put uh multiplication thingy inside uh our parentheses CU that's not how it works in Python it'll just come up as an error like that but anyways that is it for different types of variables let's move on to our next one which should be commenting right uh yes comments so let's move on to comments okay so in order to comment as you can see what I did at the beginning and here is I can put a hashtag in front of everything and make that a comment uh or I could put three Qui three single quotes like so and then we were to put something inside of it like that that would also be a comment there's two different types of commenting this way and also this way I can also comment all them at the same time right wait can I I'm pretty sure there's a command for that what do I just put a hashtag uh oh yeah like that so if I were to highlight something and I would just press play over it let mean not press and then tap my single quotes it would uh Auto automatically comment it so for example if I have print whatever this is we to press play it type it out but if I were to do this and press three quotation single quotes like that it wouldn't do anything anymore because it's commented the best use for these triple single quotes is if it has like two lines like this or more than one line however if it's one line just go to the front and press hashtag it's a lotas easier as you can see does same thing so yeah that's basically commenting quite easy all right let's move on to our second to last one which is math uh we're going to be using a lot of math in our uh in our what do you call python bot because we have to calculate the pixels and where a mouse should press so this is kind of important but uh we're not going to be doing much a lot of difficult complex math it's just more like addition subtraction but just in uh more more layers than usually than usual so yeah let's try it out so let's say we have a is our first variable which say 10 then we have B which is let's say three we say print a minus B it print out seven which is what 10 3 is all right now let's do a plus b it's going to be 13 a * B is going to be 30 like so and then a divided by B where's divide divide is slash it's going to be 3.32 33 and they run it up to five all right now we going to do three a parentheses sign I mean not parentheses uh this is called a mod so a mod b it's going to go to one uh which is basically finding the remainder so for example mod can be really useful when we're trying to find if it's an even or odd number so for example uh if I have a a right so if say a mod 2 uh it's going to be zero like so but if an a is an odd number it's going to be equal to one or something else so for example 13 oh wait it's always going to be equal to one sorry all right so this checks if it's an even or odd number so for example in like uh situations where you have to code a game to check if they like are stepping on even or odd Square then you would use this right here a mod all right let's move on to the next one which is uh which is is what do you call it exponents yeah so you could usually people think it's like this with a little carrot which is how we do it in a lot of calculators and it doesn't really work if it's a carrot it actually subtracts that's kind of cool actually I didn't know that oh wait it add wait I'm confused I don't know what it what do a car to I I didn't even know that was a thing that was come a to five oh it adds oh it does add okay so a carrot adds for some reason but that's not why I'm going to that's that's not what I'm going to show you I'm going to show you how to do an exponent which is just multiply which is the Star Sign I didn't even show multiply yet multiply like that and then we do another one this is now going to make it into an exponent so it should be 100 like so so that's basically the simple math exponents uh modding addition subtraction Division and multiplication which is what we're going to be using okay let's comment that with trick code single Cote single code like so make sure it's three or else it will come an error okay once that done that we're going to move on to our last topic for today which is arrays arays is like uh pretend let me pull up my good old paint again not that paint paint okay so pretend you have a box okay this is your box inside your box you have like a maybe like computer I don't know why you put computers at a box but you do so that's that's like more like a phone but that's a computer uh you have a soccer ball okay yeah it's a horrible looking one but it's fine okay uh and then you have your dog all right you have your dog okay I don't know what dog that is but it's a dog okay I'm more like a squirrel um okay now that's basically it this box right here is called an array and the things inside your box are what's inside of the array so they're like the little uh objects they're the objects yeah so let's go ahead and create an array # array okay so let's make an array let's say box equals 2 uh these brackets right here this is how you start an array and if you were to print the type of box print type box box like so it would come as a list which is basically an array so it's the same thing uh all right so let's enter some inputs into it so we can have a dog our computer and we also have a what is it a soccer ball so a soccer like that okay now if we're to print out our box what would it look like it would just print out this thing right here which is the array and now we're going to be uh pulling out some things from the array individually so pretend we only want a dog we could pull a box zero and array always starts from zero so this should be number zero one and two we do Bo parentheses zero is going to bring out the dog and as you expect one would be the computer and then last but not least two would be the ball soccer ball all all right there you go pretty simple stuff and you can also add integers as well as strings into the same array so it pretend have one right here so I pull out number three is going just press one like so an array can even contain an array which can contain an array in itself and keeps going further and this makes it really complicated but you could do that if you wanted to uh I'm just not recommending it because it might get too complicated or overload your PC but yeah that's basically what an array does you can add and remove stuff into an array as well so I can go ahead and do that uh box. aend right box. aend let's say SDF whatever all right and now after that wait I got to not print it right box out a pen I'm going to say print box uh so we have 0 1 two 3 4 print box five which should be this thing box 5 0 one two three oh four four like so and prints that out now if we were to say box. remove let me just delete this all right box. remove oops uh oh box. remove move dog remove dog like so and we're going to print box zero it's not going to be dog anymore it's going to be computer because it's just going to kick dog out then move computer over like so there you go so yeah that's basically it for what we're going to be doing today this is the oops this is what we're going this is what we did today arrays comments different types of variables if else print and conation so yeah that's basically it uh I hope you enjoyed this video that's Basics we haven't started anything yet but we have to know this in order to build our bot yeah anyway see you in the next episode bye
