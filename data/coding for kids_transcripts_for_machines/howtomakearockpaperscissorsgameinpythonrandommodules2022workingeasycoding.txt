hello everybody my name is jemmy and today i'm going to be continuing my series of teaching myself python in the future so i don't forget python in the future and i'm going to be showing you random module i guess in this video and i'm going to be showing you how to make a rocker scissor type of game you can actually use instead of rock paper scissors it could be something else today i'm going to make it a pokemon game so let me show you what i made and what we're going to be making by the end of this video so let's launch your notebook really quickly like so and i'm sorry if the green screen doesn't look that good i'm in a uh not great recording situation i guess but you know it's only for like a couple uh videos it should be it should be fixed like next week or something and then uh so once we're in jupiter let me open my little thingy here i'm not sure i'm not sure which one it is i it might be like um i think it's this one i didn't name it i'm pretty sure yeah i didn't name it okay uh that's pretty bad because i didn't know what it was so always name your uh python uh files and so basically first we're gonna be importing random right because we need to do that since um if we don't then we can't have the random module so once we imported it uh i will run the code and basically what it does is it says welcome to fire water grass uh basically rock paper scissors also known as fwg or fog press enter to start the battle so let's press enter by the way this is a pokemon type game or something so which pokemon type do you choose fire water grass let's pick water you chose water type the computer chose chooses fire you win okay and we can try that again right uh let's search fire the you chose fire the computer chooses water oh no you lost we try okay let's choose water again oh it's that was not that's the wrong one oh i lost again they chose grass okay wait let me try grass oh i keep on forgetting okay grass if you choose this water you win easy okay so basically that's what we're going to be doing and it's not showing now because um it's like luck based but uh it actually has a tied too so if the computer chooses the same thing as you then it ties and yeah we're going to be making that and the ascii art i will show you how to get that too so yeah let's make let's start making it alright so once we're in jupiter notebook i just closed out that notebook that we can open a new python ipy kernel and uh we're gonna rename it this time we're gonna rename it to something that actually means uh so like random yeah i'm gonna name it ep three i'm pretty sure random the ap3 i'm not sure i think it's ep 5 i lost track i'm just going to say random module random module and oh i'll just say random module okay and click rename and first the most important thing is to import the module module okay there you go and the module name is going to be random in this case so we're going to import random like so ctrl enter you might need to wait a bit if you don't have it installed but i already have it installed so i just i just run it and it's instant um so we can press run and then after that it will actually create a new cell right here and from here we're gonna be making make the game here okay and in there we're gonna have uh first we're gonna welcome them of course as we always do welcome you can be very biased because it's your own game welcome to the best i'm gonna capitalize best the best pokemon pokemon battle you will ever see okay well you will ever play in okay there you go uh now just to give them a little hint of what they're going into we're gonna have a start right here as we always do start uh equals to input which is basically uh going to wait for the user to put in their answer and our input is going to be saying uh press enter press enter to start like so with a little thingy here and that okay perfect and then now once you have this we can run it um press enter to start so press enter it doesn't really do anything yet but uh we can after that we can ask them another question so let's say uh choose wait let's say player player player choice like so play your choice it goes to input sorry if the camera is checking a little because i'm typing and it's on my laptop so it's a little shaky and the uh the desk is also kind of checking uh input uh what is the what is what what type what type of pokemon do you choose like so and we're going to have a little parentheses for them to see what they can choose so i'm going to have fire water fire water and grass you can actually search up um pokemon type chart and go into images and then there's a bunch of uh there's a bunch of uh two means it's effective so water against fire is effective so uh water winds electric against water electric winds and you can basically look around on this chart right here i chose fire water and grass because they all loop around to each other i have a google document uh let's see google i'm not sure which one it is but basically all it says is it this one yeah it's for this one so basically what it does is fire beats grass uh and then water beats fire and then grass beats water so it loops around in the full circle and that's why i chose those three because you know it's like rock paper scissors rock beats uh scissors scissor beats paper and paper beats rock so it's like a little circle you can even add more um more how you call it uh more like options or more types but then that will increase it so right now the if statement is at nine i'm pretty sure for thai win loss for every single one of them so taiwan lost high wind loss that we lost so it's gonna be nine and if you add four in there's gonna there might be like two wins two losses i don't even know how that would work anymore um maybe two ties so i would say at three which is pretty good uh number so make a little charge for you because it's gonna get confusing you can use the same thing as me if you want but uh you can make your own if you want to get creative all right now once you got that out of the way let's uh start continuing the coding so let's let's try this out okay don't mind if it goes up there it always does that for some reason sometimes it goes down something that goes up what type of pokemon do you choose so fire that's it but now the thing is we got to make sure that whatever they put in so they could put in like all caps fire like that and it would still work um because python is very case sensitive so if you put like capital capitalization but in the if statement there's lower case it won't work however to make sure that it will always be lower case we have dot lower parentheses at the end of the input this way it will force whatever they put in to be all lowercase so we can even try printing this out so print player choice like so ctrl uh control control enter and then let's put in all caps or maybe not all caps like so fire like that and then you can see it print out fire so it will just force everything to be lower case all right now once we have that out of the way we can add our uh i think i'll add the ascii art first so we're gonna have a player well not player print uh you chose and then whatever they have so uh add a little uh space plus player choice like so plus um now we're gonna have like exclamation points you chose blah blah okay and then we're gonna print an ascii art so the way to find ascii art is oh wait that that won't work because okay we gotta do something else so we gotta make um a list so type list like so equals to uh whatever you have so fire water and grass okay and now uh when the player chooses something we're gonna always have these ones so well this is just this is for the bottom pretty sure this is for the bot the player uh i think we gotta have an issue with the player too if you want to ask your art follow along if you don't then skip this part but this is we're gonna take a step further so if a player choice player choice like so equal equals to fire and then colon then tab this one print you chose uh plus player choice and this way we can copy paste easier and they're also going to print out uh print one two three to make it so that we can print multiple lines uh we're gonna print out the fire so we can search up fire ascii art like so and we're gonna press the second one the first one doesn't really work for me and then you can see we have a bunch of options here um you can choose any of them but sometimes they are very big so i recommend just sticking with a small one like this one this is the one i actually um used so we can just paste that right in the middle nice okay now once we have that we can try testing it enter fire uh okay uh we forgot to make these ones uh a string all right let's try again fire you chose fire and then there you go the fire appears um if you want to make it look better what i would recommend to do is make it a little spaced out we actually have to change these into like uh triple single quotes so we can uh make it multiple lines it's a little bit more difficult but if you want to do it then you can uh i i wouldn't recommend doing this actually since it's very um very not not good okay there let's try it again fire you chose fire and there you go i'm going to delete this one so that it doesn't have that indentation fire okay there you go okay now it looks much nicer and much more spaced out and what we can do here is we can just copy this ctrl c and paste it in here and then you can paste oops make sure to delete the indentation and we paste it three times and now this one we're gonna change to water it's gonna change to grass make sure they're all lowercase and then after that we can just change the ascii art so um to find a wave it's very it's kind of hard so let's search up wave in here i mean to find something that looks like water it's kind of hard but i uh if you search up wave it should work uh you can choose any of them i think i'll just choose like this one or something that's small i think this is smaller but you can't really tell that's a wave so i'll just choose this one looks pretty good yeah one of them is none of them is good after that one okay let's choose wave and let's paste it in here all right hey there that's pretty good that's not too big and then from here we're gonna get a plant okay let me close these two so plant planty sorry plant okay submit comp or i think any search up in here oh yeah all right loading oh let's see there's any good ones okay that one's not bad we'll come back to that okay i like this one i like this one we're gonna copy this one i couldn't find a good plant last time so it looks pretty bad all right so once we have everything uh make sure to use emojicombos.com there it's it's much better than whatever like eu that one was it that one was horrible you had to adjust everything on your own but this one looks pretty good let's try it again so let's try uh grass this time you chose grass okay that looks pretty good uh let's choose water oh i forgot water that also looks really good okay this one's pretty this is better than last time actually the emojis are much not emojis ascii guard it's much more same sized last time one of them was big one of them was small it was really weird and then all them looks looks like what it's supposed to represent so that's good too and okay once you've got the ascii art out of the way let's do the random um the random uh the random i don't know how to call that the random stuff okay so i'm going to copy type list and put it down here so it's easier for us to see and then after that i'm going to make so that the robot chooses it so i'm going to search comp i'm not gonna search computer choice um that's gonna be a variable equals to uh random dot red int like so and then from there we're gonna have one i know zero zero comma three two comma two sorry because now we can actually use uh fire water and grass since python starts at zero so you start at zero one two instead of one two three which will cause one two three and then three is not there so it's gonna cause an error and that's why we have to zero to two you can have it one two three if you want but then you would have to subtract one off um when you print it out so once if let's print it out so let's print um let's print let's copy this one let's copy this one you chose uh yeah this entire thing okay we're not entitling just this this this much okay perfect and then now we're gonna paste it into here like so and instead of you chose we're gonna choose we're gonna uh the computer chose and then plus computer computer choice oh wait that that won't work right uh let's see let's see oh no we can that can work we can just do type list like so oh yeah we can just copy okay okay this is this works this works then copy type listen to here and then from there we can uh we can uh calling not colon sorry uh parenthesis this so type list computer choice so you can zero one two and then let's try it out uh unindented oh yeah i forgot okay there press entry oh geez okay you what type of pokemon you shoot i choose fire you chose fire and then there's an error list object is not callable list object is not callable type type list computer choice what went wrong there list object is not callable uh do we have to make this an str i'm pretty sure we do okay i forgot to convert it to an sdr but less it should work now uh fire uh it's still it's still not working str type list uh let's try printing it oh oh and we can have another if statement so if computer choice equals oh i'm indenting that if computer choice equals equals to zero then what we want to do is uh you want to print uh the computer chooses blah blah okay so we're gonna copy this and we're gonna paste it in here like so we're gonna delete this and then we're gonna delete so we're gonna indent that a little bit so the computer chose and we're gonna put fire in here so we're gonna delete that fire like so and then we're gonna copy this one more time or two more times actually like so i'm pretty sure there's a better way of doing this but i don't i don't know it right now so uh we can we can just do this zero one and two so the computer cho chooses water as the second option and then grass is the dopes and then grass is the third option like so okay fire the mirror shows grass okay now it works okay um there's probably a much better way of doing this but i don't know it at the moment so i i really don't know how to do it and the last time we did it that didn't really work out either so once we have done this we're going to have the a lot of if statements now so we can act or or there's another way we can have the computer print an ascii art too that would be kind of cool but okay let's let's have the computer print out the ascii art as well so um we chose grass right let's let's i have another one okay and then oh this is water type right so copy this where is the water here okay uh up here print you can print the computer shows water okay right here paste that all right and then grab the fire like so and then go to the fire type one right here uh there okay and then print that as well all right now let's try saving this first and then let's run it okay let's see and okay unexpected indent so something got indented uh here delete this uh something else got deleted chose grass where is that in 22 ah here okay let's try it out another one man okay is there anything else i don't think there is so this time it should work okay it does work okay uh fire you chose fire the computer chose grass okay that much that's much more visual and we can actually see what's going on so i like that better and now we're gonna make the if statement so if uh player choice right is it called player choice yeah it's called player choice okay if player choice equals equals to fire so we're gonna work on fire first and um computer choice right computer choice okay come computer choice equals equals to zero so this is fire and fire then what we're gonna do is we're gonna print you tied you tied try again you tie try again okay we're going to copy this and then paste it a couple times paste make sure there's no indent so after that just change this by one two and then from there change the string inside um instead of you tied so if computer versus water that means you lost so you lost dot dot dot try again okay and then for fire versus grass that means you win so you win like so all right and we're gonna copy this one more time twice so one two okay now we gotta be very very very careful with this so we're gonna count one two three now we'll go with this one water water water and from this one grass grass grease no grass okay uh grass again all right and then now we're gonna have to change this up a little bit so it's a view when you lost um so if water and fire that means water wins so we're gonna control see this one control v on top of this one and then if water versus water that means you are tied so control c u tied so control c uh control v all right and then now you lost because water versus grass grass wins so you lost try again right here all right and then now let's do grass so grass versus fire that means they lost so uh we already have that copied it so we might as well just paste it in all right and then if grass versus water that means they win so copy you win and put that right in here that's versus water and if grass versus grass that means you tied um try again copy this and then paste in here like so and that should be good so let's try running this press enter to start whatever pokemon you choose fire you chose fire the computer should host fire you tie try again okay uh let's try water oh sorry water you chose water your computer shows grass no we lost okay let's try again uh this is kind of fun fire uh let's try water this no no grass grass let's try grass oh wait okay grass no how does it keep them tying with me okay we're gonna choose fire there's no way it's gonna get fire again no way i'm not gonna win oh no i'm gonna stick with fire come on i love fire type pokemons come on no i tied come on there must be you i must win there's no way i'm gonna lose everything wait uh i'm sticking with fire fire fire fire dude no way the computer what i i didn't program it to do this um okay uh let's see water yes we finally won after like six games oh my gosh i'm the most unluckiest person in the entire world okay uh grass we lost though okay at least we won once okay so that's how to make a fun little rock paper scissor game in python i hope you enjoyed this episode uh it was a bit scuffed especially the camera and stuff but i hope you enjoyed it and i'll see you next episode bye
