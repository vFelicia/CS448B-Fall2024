my name is jimmy and today i'm going to be showing you some functions of um operators and or not and i'm going to be showing you um true or false uh so like one is more than two is that true or false false right so i'm going to show you how to do that in python first of all let's start off with true or false now in here it's pretty interesting because you can change it to different ways okay so let me just show you um how the basics of it first so here x equals to one one more than two right and then we do print x does do you think that this is going to be true or false false right okay false there we go false which means that it's false so yeah this is the simple basics of it what if we do something interesting what if we put an input and stuff okay let's see let's um use our technique from our last video which is inputs to apply to this project so let me first of all remember to name your project or else you're gonna get confused so let me just name this uh true slash false okay now after this let's just uh say something like input input and then type a question like is one greater than two and then question mark boom bam like that and then they'll have to answer it and once they answer it we just print out and they can check by themselves if it's correct so like this and then print and then wait let's just put x up here x 1 greater than two put that equal sign okay and then print the answer is oh wait let's just say print x there we go let's just see what it does okay it runs is one greater than two let's just say uh true how about true okay they'll say it's false which means that the correct answer is false so yeah it's pretty fun you can change it to a bunch of different stuff just to remember to change this one too and yeah that's true or false pretty simple right if you um want to know if this will work then we could change it this way less okay sorry for hitting the microphone it might be a little loud it's one less than two true yeah it's correct see so yeah that's true or false now moving for the second one is operators for um and or and not so um there's three operators as i said before and or and not let me explain them first and if there's a false and true right then if you combine the false and true and we'll say that it's false okay so if there's false and true combined it's false but if it's false and false combined false true and true true okay that's and for or if there's um a true and false it's going to say it's true okay so there's x and y okay pretend and x is true y is false and then um x or y and then it says it's true if it's both wrong both false then it's false both true then it's true not if it's true it's false if it's false it's true simple right okay now moving on i'm going to show you how to use it in code so in here we can do like x equals to 10 um no x equals to 10 and 10 greater than two okay and then print x first right okay sorry for hitting the microphone x and then let's just comment all of these okay there we go and then um here we will probably see a true okay true yes true however if we put in front of print not x let's see not okay okay sorry wrong place right here okay no that would mean it's a variable name hmm where do i put it again uh print no i don't think you need print for this one right not x oh oh no no i figured it out z equals to not x so we print z huh i'm smart you know okay let's see false there we go and that's how you invert or as you can say outward um a true into a false however if we switch it around like this it should become a true even though this is false but it's revert the x and then print the z which is revert x's which means that it's going to be true let's look true as we can see that's the basic operator of not let's change it okay so let's say that this is false right guys this is false right because 10 is greater than 2 but this is 10 is less than 2. so x is false how about we create of y y equals 2 2 is greater no less than you can put them together if you want less than 10 what about this and then we're going to print y whoops parentheses y parentheses and then you say and y and x and then print z so false as i said before and if you have a true and false combining together is going to be false okay however if you have a true and true combined it's going to be true okay let's see if we can revert this okay like that true 2 is less than 10 oops and then 10 is greater than 2 there now it should be true and it's true there we go guys now for um both false as we know it's going to be false so 10 is less than 2 and 2 is greater than 10. now it's gonna be false okay here false there we go we're getting to you're getting the hang of it right it's pretty simple um however if we do an or and one of them is true okay then it's going to be um true okay look true there we go because this y is true and x is false however for or if one of them is false then um and one of them is false one of them is true then it's true okay however if um one of them is true the other one is true then it's true false false is false okay let me just demonstrate it so now the now this is both false okay so if we click it it should be false false there we go now let's do both true less than and then go up here and then there now let's play true see because both of them are true nice now let's do oh we're done actually so that was pretty simple guys it's the lesson for today true and false and operators so i hope you found something helpful in this lesson uh something useful and you can apply to your project um so yeah i'll see you next episode bye i hope you found something useful
