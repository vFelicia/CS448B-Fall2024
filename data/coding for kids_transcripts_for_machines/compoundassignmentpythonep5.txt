hi guys my name is jeremy and today i'm going to be showing you compound um assignments and it's basically uh the math commands but in shorter terms so you wouldn't have to write all that code so let me just um get you started first of all we need uh to name our topic again so com pound uh sub no compound um compound assignment so as i sign that's there assignment um and then what you do is uh usually you would go like this right x equals to 10 um and then we do uh y equals to x subtracted by five right so if we do something like that then what's the result wait let me just print why like that okay what's the result five right but as you can see it's pretty long um if we want to make it shorter it's pretty simple all you have to do is this x minus equals to 10. like that nope okay right here change this to x real quick okay zero because minus ten and x is ten so zero everyone equals five subtract this to five then it's five so it's much easier than having to do something as long as um x no y equals to x minus five like it's much easier okay it's much more um shorter too so yeah now there's more commands not only do you you can do this but there's more so there is let me just comment this there's x add equals to five so now it's going to add on x it should be 15. okay yep and there's 15 okay and this is the same as oops and then it should be the same as this uh like this okay now um it's way shorter as you can see and there is still more with multiplication um division uh exponents modulus which is remainders rounded quotients and a bunch more so let me just show you um what they do so this one is exponents x and then two um stars uh equal to five so now it's going to um exponent ten by five so it's ten by the power of five and there we go that's a bunch okay after we're done with that uh we're going to do how about multiplication normal one okay so here it is x um star equal to five so it's five times ten should be fifty yep fifty there we go so as you can see it's way way shorter it's more easier to use too um so yeah i recommend you using it uh we're not done yet though so let's go ahead and do division division is just a slash okay slash equals to five you divide ten by five should be two two there you go how about we do 10 by 3 okay let's see 10 by 3 is um it has a bunch of decimals right however if we want to round the decimals then what we do is x double slash equals to three there now it should round it to one rounded rounding it to a one wait one sec so x divided by three hmm that should work too okay so let me just see or you could always just use the old you know method where you go like this x oh no no i think you need to comment this before you do that okay x double slash equals two three let's see yes there we go equals c3 that i didn't comment this so it um triggered something so yeah now that's the rounded uh rounded quotient now let's do the um now let's do there's nothing else no there's modulus which is remainders so for the remainders we do x percentage sign equals to five no actually that's that three so then it should be one because three goes into ten three times which leaves which is nine and there's one remainder so let's see it should be one yep there you go one so guys this is the compound assignment it's pretty simple um it makes her code a whole lot more short more concise and it doesn't need to be this long as you can see over here although this method still works too so if you don't understand this quite yet then you could use this however i recommend you using this because it's more easier to understand and it's way more shorter it'll save a bunch of time so yeah see you next video bye
