00:00 - welcome to part 14 a circle jump this
00:03 - time around we're gonna spend some time
00:05 - fixing a couple of things that have
00:07 - gotten broken in previous steps and
00:10 - we're gonna start working on adding a
00:13 - little polish that we want to improve
00:16 - the quality of life a little bit before
00:17 - we call this game ready to release all
00:22 - right let's get started
00:23 - the first thing we're gonna need to do
00:25 - is fix a couple of things that I broke
00:26 - last time when we added the bonus
00:29 - feature a couple of things that changed
00:32 - were on the circle we are counting the
00:38 - number of orbits differently now and so
00:42 - the limited circles just stopped working
00:46 - because right here if current orbits is
00:50 - less than zero well current orbits is
00:52 - counting how many times we've gone
00:52 - around we're gonna lose if it's greater
00:55 - than or equal to no more bits
01:01 - another thing we broke was on main when
01:04 - we were doing the level counting right
01:06 - we would go up a level that was based on
01:08 - score but now our score is jumping super
01:12 - high because of the bonus so our level
01:15 - can't be based on comparing our score to
01:18 - the number of circles per level we need
01:21 - to count how many circles we're touching
01:24 - as well as the score so we're going to
01:27 - add another variable here for that so
01:30 - enum circles and then down here when we
01:37 - when we start a new level we need to set
01:41 - enum circles to 0 and then whenever we
01:49 - get some points here we're also going to
01:52 - when we get captured we're gonna
01:55 - increase num circles and then this is
02:00 - where we're going to compare for this
02:04 - level so I'm going to take this code I'm
02:08 - gonna move it from the set score
02:10 - function and put it here
02:12 - and this is going to be if numb circles
02:14 - is greater than 0 and numb
02:20 - circles compared with the settings then
02:24 - we'll go up a level show the level
02:26 - message on our HUD we have the problem
02:28 - that the animation player can't play the
02:31 - bonus animation for example right
02:35 - whether we flash the bonus and the
02:37 - message at the same time because they
02:39 - were on the same animation player at the
02:42 - show message and so I've split these up
02:45 - into multiple animations and this was
02:48 - really easy to do if you have an
02:51 - animation player like say this one and
02:53 - you wanted to copy this you can actually
02:56 - copy the animation go to another
02:59 - animation player in and choose paste and
03:02 - it'll shift right over there and so I've
03:04 - made a bonus a score in a message
03:06 - animation so that they can operate
03:08 - separately the score one is just I
03:10 - copied it from the bonus one so we can
03:13 - pulse the score when they get points but
03:17 - I also want to do something else where
03:19 - since you're getting bonus points now
03:21 - your score can be jumping from you know
03:23 - 50 to 75 or something like that and
03:26 - rather than just changing the number I
03:28 - want to show it rolling upwards and I
03:32 - want to see the numbers flickering as it
03:34 - rises to the new score so that's what
03:37 - we're going to add next and we're gonna
03:38 - do that with this tween node and so in
03:42 - the HUD script I'm adding a score
03:45 - variable this is to track what the
03:47 - current score is so we can interpolate
03:49 - it between the current value and the new
03:52 - value and so I've changed the update
03:55 - score so instead of just updating the
03:57 - text what we're going to do is we're
03:59 - going to interpolate that score property
04:02 - between what it is now and what the new
04:04 - value is coming in which means we have
04:06 - to pass in the current score and then
04:11 - the new value so that's over in our main
04:14 - we've got to update that whenever we
04:17 - call HUD update score we have to update
04:20 - with what the score is and what we're
04:23 - changing it to so
04:24 - we're gonna say score comma zero there
04:27 - because we're going from zero to zero
04:29 - basically but down here when we get
04:33 - points we're going to take that and
04:36 - we're gonna do it before we've set the
04:40 - new value and we'll pass both like that
04:44 - so now back on our head script we are
04:48 - interpreting those two values start this
04:51 - start the tween and then we'll play that
04:54 - score animation where we flash the red
04:56 - and the size increase but then we've
04:59 - also connected the between step signal
05:04 - which goes off every step that between
05:07 - travels and that's going to pass in that
05:10 - value that it's on and so we're gonna
05:13 - set the score text to that value and
05:15 - then we'll see all the intermediate
05:17 - values between the points when we score
05:21 - which is especially when we are
05:23 - operating with a high bonus gonna be a
05:25 - lot so let's try it out here we got to
05:27 - get a few jumps going before we get some
05:29 - points but you can see the ticker going
05:32 - up there when it's adding points to me
05:38 - okay so that's gonna do it for this
05:40 - relatively short part it's just a little
05:43 - bit more polish that we're putting on as
05:45 - we get closer to being finished and
05:48 - ready to release this app out to the
05:51 - wild I hope you're enjoying it and I'll
05:54 - see you in the next video this tutorial
