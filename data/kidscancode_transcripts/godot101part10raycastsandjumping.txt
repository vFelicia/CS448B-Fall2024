00:00 - welcome back to judo 101 this is part 10
00:03 - and in this video we're going to
00:05 - continue talking about physics and
00:08 - collisions and using a new node called
00:11 - the raycast alright let's get started
00:14 - you have our player and we can run
00:17 - around and the next logical step would
00:19 - be to make them able to jump but there's
00:23 - a few things you've got to take into
00:24 - account when you're going to implement
00:25 - jumping and it may not be obvious right
00:28 - away so let's take a look at it now we
00:31 - could add a jump speed define a jump
00:35 - speed here to be let's make this try
00:39 - negative 1500 right so that's going to
00:41 - be negative you want to be upwards and
00:44 - we could just go down here and just like
00:46 - we're doing with the UI right and you I
00:49 - left we could add a check there to see
00:53 - if we want to jump upwards Frank we
00:56 - could say something like if is action
01:01 - pressed UI up and we just set the
01:05 - velocity equal to jump speed but they're
01:09 - going to be a couple of issues with that
01:11 - so let's take a look all right time I'm
01:13 - going to tap the up key I jumped up
01:16 - right but if I hold down the up key I'm
01:21 - going to keep jumping constantly right
01:24 - my velocity is always going to be
01:25 - playing upwards until I let go of the
01:29 - key and if you're trying to do a flappy
01:32 - bird style game you know that might be
01:34 - what you want to do so you can keep
01:37 - jumping in midair but you only want to
01:39 - be able to jump if we're standing on the
01:42 - ground we also don't want the jump to
01:44 - continue to happen every time where as
01:47 - long as we're holding it down right we
01:49 - want to only jump once when we tap it
01:50 - once so first let's talk about only
01:54 - allowing jumping when you're standing on
01:56 - a platform there's two main approaches
01:59 - to this one really common one is to have
02:03 - a flag something like can jump right and
02:09 - that can be a boolean
02:12 - and you go down here and when you're
02:15 - when you collide with the ground you set
02:18 - can jump to true and when you press the
02:21 - key you only allow it
02:24 - it can jump is true when you do jump you
02:27 - set it to false so now you can't jump
02:28 - again until you hit the ground and it
02:30 - goes back to true and that's that's one
02:33 - common way to approach it we're not
02:34 - going to do it that way we're going to
02:37 - use a node go over to my player here and
02:42 - we're going to add a new node to this
02:46 - called a ray cast to be and I'm just
02:51 - going to call this I'm going to name
02:53 - this the let's call it the ground ray
02:59 - and it might be a little hard to see I'm
03:02 - going to hide the collision there so you
03:07 - can see it so you can see now we have a
03:09 - equal blue arrow pointing downwards and
03:14 - that is a ray cast in it the purpose of
03:17 - a ray cast is it'll tell you if it
03:19 - collides with something so it's
03:20 - basically an extended like a collision
03:23 - shape except it just tells you if I get
03:25 - something and it only points in one
03:27 - certain direction so pointing downwards
03:32 - is what we want but we do want to move
03:34 - it a little bit right we want to make it
03:37 - lower down so let's shift it down about
03:42 - 50 pixels and then we also want it to
03:48 - it's right here cast to is how long it
03:52 - is I don't need it to be that long so
03:54 - we're going to put a 20 and so just
03:59 - project below their feet so when you're
04:02 - standing on the ground this Ray Kappe
04:05 - node is going to detect a collision when
04:08 - you're in the air it will not because
04:11 - there's nothing there and these are
04:14 - super useful little nodes you know you
04:18 - can definitely want to enable it here
04:21 - don't forget to do that you can set it
04:24 - to only detect certain
04:25 - types of nodes so it'll only detect you
04:28 - know static bodies in that way you work
04:33 - fine on platforms but not on other
04:36 - characters or whatever things like that
04:38 - and we're also going to talk about what
04:41 - the glare mask thing means just a little
04:44 - bit so let's just check this out and get
04:46 - it working okay over to our script we
04:49 - are first going to give ourselves a
04:54 - reference to that ground rain node you
04:58 - don't have to type it know it all the
04:59 - time and then to make this a little
05:03 - easier to see I'm going to set my jump
05:05 - speed to a lot a lot smaller so we don't
05:07 - jump nearly as high just when we can see
05:10 - the effect better then we're going to go
05:13 - here to where we check for the input and
05:16 - we're going to say it's action pressed
05:19 - and the ground ray gives collide then
05:27 - we'll set the jumps team so let's take a
05:29 - look at that now when I press the arrow
05:33 - key I jump up but if I hold it down you
05:36 - can see I don't jump again until I hit
05:39 - the ground again and that collision is
05:42 - happening that's pretty good but I don't
05:46 - like the repeated jumping when I hold
05:48 - the arrow down right I want to have to
05:50 - press the key again to get another jump
05:53 - well to do that we need to do this input
05:57 - detection a little difference right now
05:59 - what's happening is we're in the fix
06:01 - process function so this is happening
06:04 - every frame so every frame it checks
06:07 - this and it does it but instead we want
06:11 - to use a different function so we're
06:13 - going to set process input to true and
06:18 - that means we can define a function
06:20 - called input 1 and
06:27 - this function will trigger every time an
06:29 - event happens and it will pass the event
06:31 - into it so we're going to take that yes
06:35 - I'm going to put that in here and
06:39 - instead of saying input we're going to
06:41 - put use it so it's the event that
06:44 - happens that triggers this function is
06:46 - that then we will do it and you can see
06:52 - that will solve our repeated jumping
06:55 - problems I'm holding the arrow key down
06:56 - now if I let go and tap it again
06:59 - I will jump again so I can do it as
07:01 - often as I want but I have to press the
07:04 - key again to get another job okay so
07:08 - let's crank that jump speed back up
07:11 - again you not quite as high and let's
07:15 - look at our main scene we have our
07:17 - platform here right I'm going to
07:19 - duplicate that and add another platform
07:23 - over about there that's totally them I
07:28 - just want to make sure we have room to
07:30 - sit and you can see we should be able to
07:33 - jump up and get on that plus one just as
07:38 - well all right if we're underneath you
07:41 - can't jump we're going to fall to our
07:43 - head what if we wanted it to work a
07:48 - little differently and have our player
07:51 - jump up through the platform and then
07:53 - land on the top all right let's go over
07:56 - to our platform and over here this is X
08:00 - body 2d section you see the one-way
08:04 - equalizer options and here is where we
08:08 - want to set these properties direction
08:10 - is what direction you want to make the
08:14 - collisions happen so we want to happen
08:15 - you want to hit the top of the platform
08:17 - that means when bodies are moving
08:20 - downwards so that means we want to put
08:23 - this a direction a direction vector
08:25 - pointing downwards and then we have max
08:28 - depth that is how far the body can
08:32 - penetrate into this before it snaps up
08:38 - to the top right and counts as a
08:40 - on the top and that let's just set this
08:45 - to 16 we right now have a 32 height here
08:49 - so that would be half height so if we
08:53 - run our code now we should see you jump
08:57 - up and we land on top perfect except you
09:04 - might notice that we are going behind
09:06 - the platform so let's just go to the
09:10 - player and if we go to its the property
09:16 - we just put that to one and that will
09:18 - make sure that the player gets drawn on
09:20 - top of the platform that's better and
09:31 - one last thing we can do is jump is we
09:34 - can set a minimum jumping speed and what
09:40 - that is going to let us do notice that
09:43 - that's about the same - 500
09:45 - and what that going to let us do is if
09:48 - you hold the jump key down you're going
09:51 - to get a full jump if you just tap it
09:53 - and let go quickly you're going to jump
09:56 - a shorter distance so in our input you
10:01 - want to look for the event these action
10:04 - released also on UI up if that happened
10:10 - we need to check what our Y velocity is
10:14 - if it's less than min jump then we're
10:19 - going to set it equal to and jump and
10:23 - what's that that's going to allow us to
10:25 - do is give a little tap and see I can do
10:28 - a short jump if I hold it down I'll do
10:31 - the full jump up
10:36 - and if you want to do this a different
10:39 - way you could also get the same effect
10:42 - by using the clamp function and clamping
10:46 - the Y velocity to as a min jump or
10:52 - whatever it is and that will give you
10:55 - the same effect that's going to do it
11:01 - for this lesson
11:02 - hopefully you can see how useful these
11:05 - Ray casts are you can imagine if you're
11:09 - doing you want to do wall detection you
11:12 - could have them pointing out in front or
11:15 - behind of the player they can be used
11:18 - for bullets if you're doing a shooter
11:21 - game where you want really high speed
11:24 - bullets you really just project one of
11:26 - these outwards from the player and if it
11:29 - hits something and you hit it with the
11:30 - bullet and you know you can point even
11:33 - whatever direction and get all sorts of
11:35 - different effects of them they're super
11:37 - useful and you'll see we're going to use
11:39 - them for other things as time goes on
11:42 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
11:44 - next time
11:51 - you
