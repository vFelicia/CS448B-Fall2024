00:00 - welcome back this is part 11 of space
00:02 - rocks the Godot engine game tutorial
00:04 - where we're making an asteroid style
00:06 - game last time we started making an
00:08 - enemy spaceship and this time we're
00:10 - gonna add it to the main scene and we're
00:12 - gonna make it shoot at the player
00:13 - alright let's get started now that we
00:17 - have our enemies set up with their paths
00:18 - we're gonna make them spawn in the main
00:21 - scene so over here I've added an enemy
00:23 - timer to the main scene and in the code
00:27 - we are just loading the reference to
00:31 - that enemy timer so what we want to do
00:34 - is we want to do a couple of things we
00:37 - also need to read we also need a preload
00:39 - the actual enemies scene so that we have
00:43 - a way to spawn it or instance it so
00:50 - we'll grab an immediacy and path and
00:55 - paste that in there so what we're gonna
00:58 - do is every time this enemy timer ticks
00:59 - down we're going to instance one of
01:01 - these enemies but we're gonna want to be
01:03 - able to vary the spawn rate as the
01:08 - player gets to higher levels more
01:10 - enemies spawning that kind of thing so
01:13 - what I'm gonna do is when we start a new
01:16 - level okay we're going to take the enemy
01:21 - timer and we're gonna stop it
01:23 - so might've been running from the what
01:25 - the last level might have you know only
01:27 - had a couple seconds left I don't want
01:28 - the enemy to spawn based on the timing
01:31 - from the previous level so we're gonna
01:33 - stop it and then we're going to set the
01:37 - time that we want to wait so we do set
01:41 - wait time and this will set how long we
01:44 - want it to wait well I'm gonna do for
01:46 - right now I'm just going to do a Rand
01:48 - range between 20 and 40 seconds after we
01:52 - get this working we'll come back in here
01:54 - and we'll make these variables so that
01:56 - we can set them her level and then we
02:01 - started so that way we can make sure
02:04 - that we are working and then will
02:06 - respawn it again later or will change
02:09 - how it responds later so we're just
02:10 - going to take that enemy timer and we're
02:12 - going to connect the
02:13 - timeout signal and this is going to
02:20 - create one other instance one of these
02:22 - enemies
02:23 - so we instance it we're gonna add it as
02:27 - a child and we're going to set the wait
02:33 - time actually I'll just copy this from
02:39 - up here we're gonna take this wait time
02:40 - and we're just gonna restart it again so
02:43 - we're gonna reset this value again and
02:49 - we're gonna start it alright so if we
02:55 - hit play now we should see the enemy
03:00 - spawning after a certain amount of time
03:03 - right I gave it a little bit of time
03:04 - because we don't want it to be popping
03:06 - up right away nor do we want it to be
03:11 - very frequent all right these are gonna
03:14 - be things that come out every once in a
03:16 - while and hassle you and make it more
03:19 - difficult for you to stay alive so 30
03:24 - seconds or so goes by here okay and
03:33 - there it is okay so just spawn it's
03:35 - following whatever path we told it to
03:38 - follow but we have a small problem
03:41 - and I noticed this while I was testing
03:43 - before I started making the video if we
03:46 - look at in the debugger you can look at
03:49 - the remote inspector wolf which will
03:51 - show you the scene tree as it exists
03:52 - right now here's the main scene there's
03:56 - the enemy why is the enemy still there
03:59 - it should have be spawned right there we
04:02 - just spawned another one so we're having
04:06 - a problem where we are not we're having
04:09 - a problem where we are not actually
04:12 - deleting the enemy when it goes off
04:13 - screen like it's supposed to so here's
04:17 - our enemy scene we had made this
04:19 - visibility notifier and just said that
04:22 - when it exits the screen it should queue
04:24 - free
04:26 - but that is not working even though when
04:31 - we reach the end of the offset here we
04:35 - are off the screen and so I played
04:38 - around with it some and I'm not quite
04:43 - sure yet I need to do some more testing
04:45 - but I suspect this may be a bug in the
04:46 - visibility notifier when it's a child of
04:50 - a of a path fellow 2d it's not detecting
04:55 - the transition to going off-screen but
04:58 - in the meantime I think the easiest way
05:01 - to solve this is to we're gonna get rid
05:04 - of the visibility notifier so I'm just
05:07 - gonna get rid of that function and I'm
05:09 - gonna delete the node okay and instead
05:14 - in the script here in the process when
05:16 - we're when we're moving we're just going
05:19 - to check that if the on the follow we're
05:23 - going to get the unit off step which
05:26 - just measures from the beginning of the
05:28 - path at zero to the end of the path at
05:30 - one and if our offset is greater than
05:33 - one then we know we have reached the end
05:36 - and we will do the Q free and that will
05:39 - solve our problem the enemy instances
05:42 - will go away and be deleted when they go
05:44 - off the screen so our next step is to
05:47 - get that enemy to shoot at the player
05:49 - and so I've made this enemy bullet seen
05:52 - with it's just an area 2d and a sprite
05:56 - and a collision just like we made our
05:58 - player bullet but I did also find in the
06:02 - as far as the art goes I found this this
06:06 - pretty cool texture that has all sorts
06:10 - of cool glowing looking laser beams
06:13 - I thought these looked really nice and
06:16 - glowy so I decided to use them instead
06:19 - of the ones that were in the Kenny art
06:21 - pack so this comes as a single texture
06:25 - with all of the individual beams in it
06:28 - so when you drop this on your bullet you
06:32 - don't want to use the whole image so you
06:34 - use region here you set region and then
06:37 - you can go in here and draw a box around
06:38 - which part of the
06:40 - texture you want to use for your sprite
06:44 - okay so there's the enemy bullet so now
06:47 - we need to just talk about how we're
06:50 - going to make it move we're going to
06:52 - obviously instance it at the location of
06:55 - the enemy and it's going to travel in
06:59 - the direction of the player and here's
07:03 - the script for that it's very simple
07:05 - it's pretty much based on how we did the
07:07 - player bullet we have the visibility
07:11 - notifier freeing it when it goes off the
07:13 - screen and other than that we're just
07:16 - moving at a steady speed in a straight
07:18 - line at whatever direction we said to
07:21 - start at so back to our enemy I've added
07:25 - a bullet container which is just a basic
07:27 - node that's going to hold all the
07:29 - bullets and the shoot timer which is
07:32 - going to control how quickly the enemy
07:34 - fires so if we go over to our script
07:37 - I've just added a couple of variables to
07:40 - refer to those and we're gonna use that
07:43 - to make things happen now for the shoot
07:49 - timer we're probably going to want to
07:52 - vary this the amount of time between
07:56 - well it's also based on level so I'm
08:00 - just gonna set the wait time to about
08:02 - say 1.5 seconds for now and this is
08:06 - going vary by level is we will change
08:09 - that in a little bit to when we start to
08:12 - configure how things vary by level in
08:15 - general so we'll just say start and
08:19 - we'll connect the timeout signal and
08:25 - this is going to shoot and actually I'm
08:30 - going to call this shoot one because I'm
08:33 - going to define a function that shoots
08:37 - one bullet you'll see why in a few
08:41 - minutes I have some other things I want
08:43 - to do too so we need to calculate what
08:45 - direction that bullet is going to fly in
08:49 - so we need to get the global position of
08:53 - our selves and we need to subtract the
08:58 - target well what is the target we
09:00 - haven't set that so when we so when we
09:05 - first start we don't have a target all
09:12 - right so we're gonna have a variable
09:12 - called target we're gonna need to set
09:14 - that when we instance the bullet or
09:17 - actually we need to set that when we
09:19 - instance the enemy we're gonna set that
09:23 - and then we're gonna usually set it to
09:25 - the player because that's what we want
09:26 - the enemies to shoot at but we'll get
09:29 - the global position of that then we
09:36 - instance a bullet add it as a child of
09:41 - the bullet container and then we use the
09:49 - start at the bullets start at method to
09:54 - set its angle to whatever the angle of
09:57 - that vector was towards the player and
10:00 - we started so location is going to be
10:04 - the global position of the enemy so how
10:10 - do we set the target well we need to set
10:13 - that when we instance the enemy over in
10:16 - the main so back over here and the main
10:19 - script when we added the enemy here
10:22 - we're just gonna say the enemy's target
10:24 - is the player and if we check that out
10:30 - and it skipped ahead a little bit just
10:32 - so that we can see the enemy when it
10:35 - comes on screen and you have to wait the
10:39 - whole time
10:43 - sorry for the testing on the videos I
10:45 - probably should have set the spawn time
10:47 - lower just so that we could see the
10:48 - enemy pop out quickly just to see it
10:51 - happening all right there it is okay
10:53 - there comes a bullet it comes a bullet
10:55 - they are flying towards where the player
10:58 - is but not very fast
11:01 - so they're pretty easy to dodge and
11:05 - that's okay we can obviously adjust that
11:08 - the enemy bullets have a speed here we
11:11 - can increase or decrease this right we
11:14 - can also the other thing I wanted to do
11:17 - was also have a function where we can
11:20 - where I want to try this out I should
11:23 - say I don't know for sure if this is
11:26 - what I want to do so I'm just going to
11:28 - try it this way and I will probably
11:31 - Clete will probably clean up this code
11:32 - later if it turns out to be something
11:34 - that we like and want to keep doing I
11:37 - just want to try it out a little bit at
11:39 - the moment so what I'm gonna do is make
11:41 - a different function where it shoots a
11:44 - spread of bullets so for this we're
11:48 - gonna do the same thing we're gonna find
11:50 - the direction that we needed to go in
11:53 - but then we're going to have a little
11:57 - loop here where we add to the angle by a
12:03 - certain amount so I'm gonna just add and
12:06 - subtract 0.1 radians from the from the
12:12 - direction and then we instance it like
12:15 - we did here but when we do start at we
12:22 - take the angle and we add we just add
12:24 - that a okay so let's just call that
12:27 - shoot three now when the timer runs out
12:30 - and in the interest of testing I'm going
12:32 - to go over here and change the spawn
12:36 - time to a low number so that we will see
12:39 - it come out pretty quick
12:44 - okay so here comes our like there we go
12:46 - so there you see the spread of bullets
12:48 - coming out that's not too bad
12:54 - obviously we get some sound in there
12:56 - that'll be better and of course we want
12:58 - them to do something when they run into
13:01 - the player of course okay so I went
13:04 - ahead and did that I just added a sound
13:05 - player and I'm playing the enemy Laser
13:08 - sound when the enemy shoots again I'm
13:11 - not going over the details of that
13:12 - because we've already done that before
13:14 - in other nodes but now we at least have
13:17 - a little bit of a sound so we're gonna
13:20 - leave that as it is now for the for this
13:25 - video and in the next one we will start
13:29 - to figure out how to make the enemy
13:30 - bullets damage the player the player
13:32 - bullets damage to the enemy the player
13:36 - might run into the enemy we got to deal
13:37 - with that and the other thing is also I
13:40 - also want I was thinking of another type
13:42 - of weapon that the enemy might have
13:43 - which would be a kind of homing missile
13:46 - slash torpedo kind of thing that will
13:48 - not quite move as fast but it will
13:51 - follow the player and create a big
13:52 - explosion so you want to get away from
13:54 - it before it gets near you alright
13:56 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
13:58 - next time
14:07 - you
