00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:01 - pygame this is part 13 of our platformer
00:05 - development and in this video we are
00:08 - going to improve greatly improve our
00:11 - jumping all right let's take a look at
00:14 - where we are right now it's starting to
00:18 - look pretty good but we do have some
00:20 - problems you can see right there with
00:22 - the jumping where we're snapping to the
00:24 - platforms a little too quickly and it
00:28 - doesn't feel very natural right if I can
00:32 - get it to happen here one thing you'll
00:37 - notice there's actually two different
00:39 - things going on okay there it happened
00:41 - right there one is when I jump up here
00:44 - and I collide with this platform even if
00:48 - my ears just barely touch it my feet are
00:52 - gonna snap to the top of it because
00:55 - that's how we wrote our code so far okay
00:59 - and that's because over here in our
01:01 - collision code we are saying if we hit a
01:05 - platform alright so we test to see if we
01:09 - collided with a platform and if we did
01:12 - we put our Y position at the top of the
01:16 - of the platform so that's why I snapped
01:19 - up to that one yeah I can do it again
01:21 - right so that's why I snapped up to this
01:24 - one but why did I wind up on this one
01:27 - well the problem happens when we collide
01:29 - with more than one platform at once
01:32 - which you can see as soon as my feet
01:35 - we're to get put here I'd actually be
01:38 - touching two platforms at once and if I
01:41 - plot press 2 or if I contact two
01:43 - platforms at once then hits has two
01:45 - platforms in it but we're snapping to
01:49 - our feet two hits number zero the first
01:52 - one in the list well when I collide with
01:55 - both of these how do I know which one's
01:57 - going to be the first in the list the
01:59 - answer is we don't the sprite cloud
02:00 - command doesn't order them in any way so
02:04 - sometimes I'll be standing on this one
02:07 - and sometimes it'll snap to this one and
02:09 - I can't control which it is
02:13 - let's see sometimes I'll stand on the
02:15 - lower one but other times I'll snap up
02:20 - to the higher one so that's very
02:22 - confusing doesn't feel natural so we
02:26 - need to do we need to fix both of those
02:28 - problems okay so what we're going to do
02:33 - is we're going to need to figure out
02:39 - which of the platforms that we're
02:43 - hitting is the lowest no
03:00 - okay so the first thing we're gonna do
03:02 - is we're gonna improve the snapping to
03:06 - the top and basically I only want to
03:09 - snap I don't want to snap to the top as
03:10 - my ears just barely hit the bottom of
03:11 - the platform I want to snap to the top
03:13 - if my feet get high enough to pass the
03:18 - bottom of the platform so here I'm going
03:21 - to say if the players Y position is less
03:26 - than hit 0 rec top bottom and then right
03:34 - so we're gonna we're gonna only snap to
03:37 - the platform if our feet right are
03:42 - higher than the bottom of the platform
03:44 - okay
03:45 - and what that's gonna do is that's gonna
03:48 - look like this okay
03:49 - so find a jump that's a little higher ah
03:54 - there we go see so now see I can't make
03:56 - it onto that platform because my feet
03:58 - can't get high enough but if my feet do
04:03 - get high enough I might not be able to
04:06 - make this jump we'll try another one if
04:09 - my feet do get high enough there we go
04:10 - see ice I do
04:11 - get on to the platform okay so that
04:15 - takes care of that but it doesn't solve
04:19 - the multiple platforms at once problem
04:22 - okay or which one
04:26 - here we go there's a good one right see
04:29 - I can't make this jump because the
04:33 - collision is counting me hitting both of
04:35 - these but this one the top one is
04:38 - actually coming out as it's zero or the
04:42 - first in the list and my feet aren't
04:44 - high enough to snap onto that one
04:45 - anymore so I do definitely want to land
04:48 - on this one so we need to also test to
04:52 - say when we collide we need to find
04:54 - which of the ones we collided with is
04:56 - the lowest and the lowest one is the one
05:00 - we're going to snap our feet to so what
05:04 - we're going to do is we're gonna say if
05:06 - we've hit a platform then we're gonna
05:09 - say for now that the first one is the
05:13 - lowest
05:14 - and then we're just going to look at
05:17 - each of the other hits and see if any of
05:23 - them are lower than that one and if they
05:25 - are then we'll call that one the lowest
05:26 - so if hit rock bottom is left is greater
05:30 - than that first one so if any of the
05:35 - ones in the list is lower than the one
05:37 - then the first one then lowest becomes
05:42 - that one so now well know which one is
05:46 - the lowest and then we can change here
05:50 - where we said hits zero to lowest so now
05:55 - we're gonna make sure we snap our feet
05:56 - to the lowest one if our feet go past it
06:00 - okay so let's try that out and see how
06:06 - the jumping feels now now you can
06:10 - already see we're not doing that that
06:13 - crazy snapping isn't happening anymore
06:18 - alright I barely made it to that one and
06:23 - another thing we could do is we could
06:24 - even write we snap if our feet make it
06:27 - past the bottom of the sprite right like
06:33 - let's see if I can find one that's lined
06:36 - up just right there okay so see if my
06:40 - feet made it past the bottom I snapped
06:42 - at the top so there's still a little bit
06:43 - of a snapping effect but you can see I'm
06:45 - standing on the lowest one right I'm
06:49 - always on the lowest one that I hit
06:50 - which is much better but we could even
06:54 - probably make it a little better if we
06:57 - snap if we make it past the middle
07:03 - instead of
07:10 - right instead of snapping to it there we
07:13 - could snap if we're if our feet make it
07:15 - halfway through the platform right and
07:18 - then they'll be even less of that effect
07:19 - so we could say if our paws rect dot
07:30 - Center Y so let's try that out and see
07:33 - how that looks so now I have to make it
07:37 - high enough that I'm past the center of
07:40 - the platform before I can have my feet
07:44 - beyond it which is going to mean that we
07:49 - might need to increase the number of
07:51 - platforms responding because you can see
07:53 - I'm not able to make very many of these
07:54 - jumps yet or any more but that's okay we
07:58 - can adjust that as well I just want to
08:01 - see how we're looking yeah see this
08:05 - feels much more like I'm jumping to it
08:07 - and landing on it not teleporting
08:12 - through it and we don't have any of that
08:16 - weird
08:19 - snapping going on let's see there I am
08:22 - gonna need either to increase my jump
08:25 - height or I'm going to need to increase
08:28 - or decrease the distance between
08:30 - platforms so I don't wind up stuck like
08:33 - this okay so what we're gonna do is
08:40 - we're gonna improve our jumping a bit
08:42 - and we're gonna make it so that we can
08:43 - have what's called a variable jump right
08:46 - now we jump the same no matter how hard
08:49 - or how long we press the spacebar but if
08:53 - you've played a lot of platformers you
08:54 - know a lot of them like Mario one of the
08:57 - classics has variable jump if you tap
08:59 - the the jump button really quickly you
09:02 - get a you you only jump a little bit but
09:04 - if you hold it down you jump higher and
09:06 - so that's what we're gonna do okay so
09:09 - what we're gonna do here is say so
09:13 - where's my events here we go so key down
09:16 - pressing the spacebar does the player
09:18 - jump okay we're also going to add and
09:23 - actually a
09:24 - just gonna copy and paste this we're
09:25 - gonna add a key up the event for the
09:28 - spacebar okay that way if the key goes
09:31 - up then we're going to cut our jump
09:36 - short okay so if you hold it down you'll
09:40 - get the full jump but if you press it
09:42 - and let go pretty quickly you're gonna
09:43 - cut the jump out and what that'll allow
09:46 - us to do is make our jump actually be
09:48 - higher than it is now and then the
09:51 - player can hold down to get their longer
09:53 - jump okay so now we just need to go
09:58 - define what that jump cut means so we're
10:01 - gonna go over here to sprites and if you
10:04 - remember in our player we did have this
10:06 - jumping variable which if you've been
10:10 - paying if you're paying close attention
10:11 - we never actually do anything with that
10:14 - variable anywhere we never change it to
10:15 - true for anything so we're gonna do that
10:20 - we're gonna say that in in def jump okay
10:25 - when we jump that's going to set jumping
10:30 - equal to true okay and that way we can
10:34 - only jump if we're not already jumping
10:40 - right so if jumping is false then we can
10:45 - jump and jumping becomes true okay which
10:49 - also means that back over here where we
10:53 - hit where we collide with the platform's
10:56 - when we land on a platform we better set
11:02 - jumping back equal to false or we won't
11:05 - be able to jump again so now we can do
11:08 - the jump cut and jump cut is just going
11:14 - to be if if we're jumping right we don't
11:19 - want to do if we're not jumping if we're
11:22 - jumping then as long as our Y velocity
11:26 - right our Y speed remember if we're
11:28 - going upwards so if we're moving upwards
11:31 - our our velocity in Y it's going to be
11:35 - negative so
11:37 - for moving up at a faster speed than
11:40 - minus 3 and minus 3 is just an arbitrary
11:43 - number that I picked it's not too big
11:48 - you can try out different ones and see
11:51 - how you like it but basically we're just
11:53 - gonna set it equal to that so for going
11:56 - up any faster than this and remember if
11:59 - our jump speed our player jump right now
12:01 - go to our settings is set to 16 so when
12:05 - we first hit the spacebar we're gonna be
12:07 - moving upwards at minus 16 right and
12:12 - that's gonna slowly decrease as the as
12:15 - gravity pulls us downwards but if we tap
12:20 - the bar we're gonna move upward at minus
12:22 - 16 but we let go right away then our
12:25 - speed will be less than that source
12:27 - speed is just gonna cut right down to
12:29 - minus 3 so we'll get a very short jump
12:31 - if we only tap the spacebar okay so
12:35 - let's take a look at how this works okay
12:40 - so you can see if I tap it really
12:43 - quickly I get a short jump and if I hold
12:46 - it down I get a long jump so what that
12:51 - means is we can actually go over here
12:53 - and make this even a little bigger
12:55 - because you have to hold down the
12:59 - spacebar to get that full jump that'll
13:01 - make it a option for the player now if I
13:06 - hold down I can get that big jump that's
13:08 - almost to the midpoint of the screen but
13:10 - I can also if I'm trying to do a bunch
13:12 - of quick jumps I have to figure out how
13:15 - long I want to hold him down so that
13:18 - works a lot better
13:26 - right now the letting go that if I hold
13:30 - it if I hold down the spacebar and I
13:31 - don't let go until I'm falling then
13:33 - obviously that hasn't that have any
13:34 - effect because when I'm following my Y
13:38 - velocity is a positive number so yeah so
13:44 - this is if you go back and compare this
13:45 - to how everything was working when we
13:49 - started this video this is way way way
13:52 - way bit better - and more comfortable
13:54 - and a lot more fun to play so I hope you
14:00 - enjoyed this I hope you're feeling good
14:02 - about the direction our game is going in
14:06 - play around with it some if you have any
14:08 - suggestions or comments please post them
14:11 - in the comments below and I look forward
14:14 - to seeing you in the next video
14:24 - you
