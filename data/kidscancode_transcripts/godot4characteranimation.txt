00:00 - welcome back to goodo recipes in this
00:02 - video we're going to look at how to set
00:03 - up animation for our 3D character in
00:07 - this video we're going to assume you've
00:08 - already imported all of your 3D assets
00:10 - if you haven't done that already I have
00:13 - a video on that which I'll link in the
00:14 - comments below and when you've got your
00:17 - assets imported come back here where we
00:19 - have our character and our animation
00:22 - player showing all the animations that
00:24 - were included with this particular
00:27 - character and we want to Now set this up
00:30 - so that we can use it in our game
00:33 - and for all these animations would be
00:34 - really really hard to
00:37 - keep track of and manage in your code
00:40 - imagine if you had an if statement for
00:43 - every single possible situation where
00:45 - you might want to choose a different
00:47 - animation it's going to get unmanageable
00:49 - really quick and for this example we're
00:52 - not going to do all of these animations
00:53 - but we are going to set up a system for
00:55 - using several of them and we're going to
00:58 - do that by using something called the
00:59 - animation tree
01:02 - the animation tree is going to do a lot
01:03 - of things for us including help us
01:05 - choose which animation to play but also
01:08 - how to transition between those
01:10 - animations it's also going to handle
01:12 - something called animation blending you
01:14 - can see I'm running the animation called
01:16 - running a right now but there's also an
01:20 - idle animation that we would want to
01:21 - play when we're standing still
01:24 - and if we're standing still and we press
01:26 - forward we want to change from
01:28 - this the idle animation to that Running
01:30 - Animation but we don't want to do it
01:32 - instantaneously because that's going to
01:34 - look really really jarring and so what
01:37 - we want to actually do is something
01:38 - called blending between the two
01:40 - animations and that's something
01:41 - animation tree is going to help us do
01:42 - too so let's get started by adding an
01:45 - animation tree
01:48 - to our scene here
01:51 - okay when we add the animation tree
01:52 - we'll see its settings over here and one
01:54 - of them is an in player because what an
01:57 - animation tree does is it controls an
01:59 - animation player so we want to assign
02:01 - the animation player from our scene
02:03 - there so it has a reference to that for
02:07 - what it's going to control and then we
02:09 - want to decide what our tree root is
02:11 - going to be we're going to go through
02:12 - what these various things mean but for
02:14 - right now choose animation node State
02:17 - machine as our tree root
02:21 - and then you'll see the window changes a
02:23 - little bit down here and the last
02:25 - warning we have here is the animation
02:26 - tree is inactive activate to
02:29 - make it work and if we press active here
02:32 - you're going to see the character is
02:34 - going to reset
02:35 - because now our animation tree is
02:38 - controlling what animations it plays and
02:40 - actually if you go over to the animation
02:42 - player you'll see it's still running but
02:43 - it's not showing anything because when
02:45 - you are when the animation tree is
02:47 - active it's in control the animation
02:50 - player node is not
02:53 - all right so let's look at the animation
02:55 - tree panel here so we've got a few
02:57 - buttons over here this little arrow
02:59 - stands for the select this little plus
03:02 - creates new nodes and this little arrow
03:05 - connects nodes and we're talking about
03:07 - nodes here we're talking about nodes in
03:09 - the
03:10 - State machine here not nodes in the tree
03:14 - so what we can do is if we right click
03:17 - out here we can add an animation and
03:19 - there we see the list of all the
03:20 - animations are animation player has in
03:22 - them so I'm going to choose the idle
03:28 - and if I hit play on here well now we'll
03:30 - see that idle playing
03:33 - and I'm also going to for this quick
03:35 - example just pick one more let's just
03:38 - say the
03:39 - melee attack
03:41 - and we want to
03:43 - look at how we would connect these
03:44 - together so if we go to the
03:47 - transition mode we can drag connections
03:50 - between these so for example dragging
03:52 - from start to idle means idle is going
03:55 - to play when we start the scene this is
03:58 - kind of like unready
04:00 - we can drag from here to here and it's
04:01 - going to immediately jump to there
04:04 - but we also want to be able to after the
04:06 - attack has animation is finished come
04:09 - back to idle so if I drag another arrow
04:11 - going back this way you're going to see
04:13 - it's just instantaneously going to be
04:15 - flickering back and forth between them
04:16 - and that's obviously not ideal so what
04:19 - we want to do is
04:22 - go back to select here and we can
04:24 - determine how we want these transitions
04:27 - to happen
04:28 - so the transition from idle to melee
04:31 - here is set to Auto we don't want that
04:33 - to be Auto we want it to be enabled so
04:35 - you can transition from here to here but
04:37 - it doesn't happen automatically
04:39 - in the transition back we can change
04:42 - switch mode here to at end meaning don't
04:46 - switch back until
04:48 - the animation finishes so now we're
04:51 - playing the idle animation and if we
04:53 - ever trigger the attack animation like
04:56 - this
04:57 - it will play and then immediately go
05:00 - back to
05:01 - idle you can see which one is active by
05:03 - the red outline around them
05:08 - and this is basically how the animation
05:10 - node State Machine Works you set up a
05:13 - sequence of animations and the
05:16 - transitions between them how you get
05:18 - from one to the next
05:20 - now this was just an example
05:22 - and so I'm going to delete these
05:24 - because what we really want to do
05:27 - what we really want to do is set up that
05:30 - idle walk run cycle
05:34 - all right let's start by right clicking
05:36 - and adding a blend space 2D
05:38 - and
05:40 - I'm going to click here to change the
05:41 - name of it call it iwr because this will
05:44 - be our idle walk run
05:47 - Loop and then we'll go ahead and do our
05:50 - transition from start because we do want
05:51 - to play this one right away
05:54 - and now when we're ready to configure
05:56 - this
05:57 - blend space 2D we click the pencil icon
05:59 - here and we will kind of go inside of it
06:03 - need to be in select mode and we go
06:06 - inside of it and now you see in root
06:08 - we're inside the iwr and we see this 2D
06:11 - grid
06:13 - and this 2D grid represents is going to
06:15 - represent our character's horizontal
06:17 - movement so up here when we're going
06:20 - forward down here when we're going
06:22 - backwards when we're moving to the left
06:24 - when we're moving to the right so
06:27 - whatever our characters horizontal
06:29 - movement Vector is
06:31 - is going to match this space here
06:34 - and we have some controls over here this
06:36 - one that I'm on right now sits the
06:38 - blending position which is this little
06:39 - Crosshair and we'll see what that does
06:41 - in a minute
06:42 - this
06:44 - Arrow here is for selecting and moving
06:46 - points and this one is for creating
06:49 - points and so we want to Define our
06:52 - grid and the first one we want to add is
06:54 - right here at the center I'm going to
06:56 - click and I say add an animation
06:58 - and that's going to be the idle because
07:00 - idle is what I want to play when my
07:03 - x velocity is 0 and my y velocity is
07:06 - zero or my forward and back velocity is
07:09 - R of zero and
07:12 - so that's there enough up here at the
07:14 - top
07:15 - I'm going to want to add the running a
07:18 - animation
07:20 - down here at the bottom I'm going to add
07:23 - the walking backwards animation
07:26 - and then on the right we can use
07:30 - running strafe right and on the left
07:34 - we can use running
07:37 - strafe left and now you see those lines
07:40 - have been connected and we have this
07:42 - little diamond shape
07:44 - and so if I go back to root here for a
07:46 - second and hit play on this iwr then go
07:50 - back in
07:52 - if I select the Crosshair here I can now
07:55 - control the blending so see as I move
07:57 - forward you see we're transitioning to
07:59 - the Running Animation and when I get all
08:01 - the way here we're fully playing the
08:03 - Running Animation
08:06 - as I scale back so you see and as I go
08:09 - all the way down to the bottom we start
08:10 - playing that walking backwards we have
08:13 - strafing to the right we have strafing
08:16 - to the left
08:17 - and anywhere in between
08:21 - take a little time to play around with
08:23 - this it's really fun to see how the
08:25 - animations blend together and when
08:28 - you're done we'll head back
08:30 - to the root node
08:32 - so now this
08:34 - kind of becomes the Hub of our
08:36 - character's animations this is where
08:38 - we're ordinarily going to be unless
08:40 - we're doing something specific
08:43 - and for the other animations that we're
08:45 - going to add in this example we're going
08:47 - to add some attack animations we're
08:49 - going to add death animation and jumping
08:53 - and but jumping is a little special so
08:55 - we're going to do that one last so first
08:57 - I'm just going to add a few more
08:58 - animations like we did in the earlier
09:02 - example
09:17 - okay so now I've set these all up just
09:19 - like we did the
09:21 - earlier example with the transition set
09:24 - the way we want them so when we're in
09:26 - idle walk run we can trigger one of the
09:29 - attacks and it'll transition back to
09:32 - idle
09:33 - we can trigger the interact
09:36 - which is to push a button or a door and
09:39 - then we have the death animation which
09:40 - does not have a transition back so when
09:42 - it happens
09:45 - that's when the game's over
09:47 - and so this is all just like the example
09:51 - before and now we want to set up jump
09:53 - and jump is going to work a little
09:55 - different because the jump animation
09:56 - comes in three parts
09:59 - so let's add those nodes and take a look
10:01 - at how they look
10:05 - all right so the animation for jump
10:07 - comes in three parts there's the jump
10:09 - start which is the launching off of the
10:11 - ground and there's the jump land which
10:13 - is when you hit the ground but jump idle
10:17 - is a looping animation that's designed
10:19 - to play as long as you are in the air
10:21 - so maybe you
10:23 - step off a cliff you're gonna play Jump
10:26 - Idol until you hit the ground
10:28 - so the transitions between these are not
10:30 - necessarily going to be always the same
10:34 - so we are going to want to transition
10:36 - from
10:38 - idling to jump start
10:40 - and that the way that transition is
10:42 - going to work is
10:45 - we're going to want to do it immediately
10:47 - but what we're going to do is instead of
10:49 - being automatic
10:51 - we're going to have the condition here
10:54 - jumping
10:56 - and that's going to be a condition that
10:58 - we can set in our code
11:00 - go back to
11:02 - I don't hear so now you see it's not
11:03 - even though it says Auto it's not
11:05 - transitioning into there because until
11:06 - this jumping condition becomes true
11:09 - the transition won't happen
11:12 - going from let's make a connection here
11:15 - from start to idle
11:18 - okay that's going to happen
11:21 - at end so if you trigger the jump start
11:24 - it will play and then go to jump idle
11:29 - if the transition from jump idle to jump
11:31 - land
11:35 - is also going to be Auto
11:37 - but it's going to have a
11:40 - grounded condition
11:42 - so however we will stay in the jump idle
11:45 - train uh
11:46 - we'll stay in the jump idle animation as
11:49 - long as we need to but as soon as
11:50 - grounded becomes true we're going to
11:52 - transition to jump land
11:54 - and then that transition goes back to
11:57 - iwr
12:00 - when it's finished playing
12:02 - and then lastly we're going to have one
12:04 - more transition here to go straight to
12:06 - jump idle and there you see the jump
12:07 - idle playing but that we're just going
12:10 - to set to enabled
12:14 - and we want that so that if we're
12:15 - walking along and we just step off a
12:18 - cliff we can transition to
12:20 - jump idle
12:22 - if I go back here to
12:25 - playing the idol now when a jump starts
12:29 - it will transition to this
12:32 - you see we left up we're in Jump idle
12:34 - and when grounded becomes true we'll
12:36 - transition to that
12:38 - now if you notice here let me jump back
12:40 - to here
12:42 - take a look at this a little closer
12:45 - so we're following through the air we're
12:46 - falling through the air and when I play
12:47 - Jump land
12:49 - watch the transition from jump land to
12:51 - iwr
12:53 - see there's a little jump there or a
12:55 - little stutter because those two
12:56 - animations the end of the jump land and
12:59 - the beginning of idle don't quite match
13:01 - up
13:01 - so what we can do here is in this
13:04 - transition
13:05 - add a small Crossfade time of 0.1
13:08 - seconds
13:09 - and let's watch what happens watch how
13:11 - this looks different I'm going to press
13:13 - jump land
13:14 - and then it just looks like his feet
13:16 - spread out naturally
13:18 - instead of
13:20 - that jarring effect
13:22 - all right so now we've set up all of the
13:24 - animations that we want to use
13:27 - and for most of the others if you want
13:28 - to use any of those you're going to set
13:30 - them up in a very similar way
13:32 - but these are what we're going to do for
13:33 - this demo and so in the next
13:36 - video we'll talk about how to combine
13:39 - this with code so when we start doing
13:41 - our character controller and moving
13:43 - around this screen how do we access this
13:47 - animation tree and make sure we're
13:48 - playing the right animation depending on
13:51 - what we're doing
13:52 - so if you haven't already liked the
