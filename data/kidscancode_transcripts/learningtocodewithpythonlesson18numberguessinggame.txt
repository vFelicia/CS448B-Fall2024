00:00 - welcome back to learning to code with
00:02 - Python lesson eight number guessing game
00:05 - let's use what we've learned so far to
00:08 - make a simple guessing game the computer
00:10 - is going to think of a random number and
00:12 - the player will try to guess it when the
00:15 - guess is made the computer will tell the
00:17 - player if they were too high to low or
00:19 - guess just right now before we start
00:24 - let's talk about what the steps that we
00:26 - need to take are so step one is the
00:29 - computer needs to pick a random number
00:32 - you don't have to type this stuff this
00:35 - is just going to be for us to look at
00:36 - while we're making our program so the
00:39 - second step will be that the player
00:41 - makes a guess right
00:45 - and then step three is we compare the
00:49 - guess to the number right and then step
00:56 - four is we say or we'll say we print out
01:01 - two high to low or you got it okay so
01:11 - those are basically our steps for the
01:14 - program so let's start with step one we
01:17 - need to pick a random number well we
01:19 - haven't done that before so we're going
01:21 - to need some new commands so in order to
01:25 - use the random number commands we're
01:27 - going to need to import random then we
01:31 - can pick a random number so let's call
01:33 - it secret that's what I'll name the
01:35 - variable and the secret number will just
01:38 - be a random number and we want to decide
01:40 - maybe between one and a hundred so the
01:44 - command to do that is random dot R and
01:45 - range and then inside the parentheses of
01:48 - R and range you put the two numbers you
01:50 - want the random number to be between so
01:52 - we want to put one and one hundred and
01:55 - one
01:56 - that'll give us a random number between
01:58 - 1 and 100 remember R and range works
02:01 - just like when we did the counting loops
02:03 - it counts up to but not including this
02:07 - number this is where it stops so this
02:09 - will pick a number between 1 and 100
02:11 - and for now let's go ahead and print out
02:14 - secrets so we can see what number we
02:16 - picked obviously we don't want the
02:18 - player to cheat so when we finish the
02:20 - game we're not going to keep this print
02:22 - in here but let's keep it there for now
02:23 - so that we can see what happened okay
02:27 - now I'm going to save this and I'll call
02:29 - it secret and let's go ahead and run it
02:34 - and see what happens there we go our
02:38 - secret number was 56 and you'll see if
02:41 - we run it again we should get a
02:43 - different number every time
02:46 - okay that's step one done now we need
02:49 - step two the player needs to make a
02:50 - guess well just like in the last lesson
02:53 - we need to use the input function so
02:55 - let's call the let's call the variable
02:57 - guess that will hold the value of
03:00 - whatever the player types in and then
03:02 - we'll use the input and we'll ask make a
03:06 - guess now remember we want this guess
03:10 - value to be a number so that we can
03:14 - compare it to the secret number we don't
03:15 - want it to be a string so we need to use
03:18 - that int function we talked about last
03:21 - time to make sure it's a number okay so
03:25 - that's step two step three and four kind
03:28 - of go together so we'll do those at the
03:30 - same time so first to compare guests to
03:33 - number we need to say if guess is
03:36 - greater than secret then we want it to
03:40 - print to high then
03:47 - can say L if guess is less than secret
03:51 - so if it's not greater than let's check
03:53 - to see if it's less than if it's less
03:55 - than then we want to print to low and
04:00 - then finally if it wasn't too high and
04:04 - it wasn't too low that only leaves one
04:08 - option right they must have gotten it
04:10 - right so let's give it a try
04:22 - now we know what our secret is so we can
04:26 - test and see if our tests are working so
04:30 - I'm going to guess 45 and it should say
04:32 - too high good now notice the program is
04:37 - not running anymore it's ended because
04:40 - we're only going through here one time
04:42 - so the player only gets one chance to
04:44 - make a guess and we'll fix that in a
04:46 - minute but for right now if we want to
04:48 - try again we're going to need to run the
04:50 - program again and I want to run it two
04:51 - more times so I can try each case and
04:54 - make sure that my program is working the
04:56 - way I want it to so we're going to go
04:58 - ahead and run it one more time this time
05:04 - the secret is 24 so I'm going to guess
05:06 - 12 because that's lower and it said too
05:09 - low good now one more try and we're
05:14 - going to guess correct this time to make
05:17 - sure it says you got it excellent so now
05:24 - our tests are working right and we're
05:26 - saying the right thing but you only get
05:29 - one guess
05:30 - if you don't know the secret already
05:31 - that doesn't make the game very fun so
05:34 - what we really want to do is let the
05:36 - player keep trying and making another
05:39 - guess until they get it right
05:42 - so how do we do that well we don't want
05:44 - to use a counting loop like we've done
05:45 - before because we don't know how many
05:47 - guesses the player might take to get it
05:49 - they might get it in a small number of
05:51 - guesses or it might take them a lot so
05:54 - we want to use a loop that just goes
05:56 - until they get it right so that's not a
06:01 - counting loop that's a kind of loop
06:02 - called a conditional loop and here's
06:04 - what a conditional loop looks like so
06:09 - what parts of this program do we want to
06:10 - repeat well we want to repeat the parts
06:13 - that I've highlighted here we want the
06:15 - player to make a guess we print out what
06:18 - the result was and then we do that again
06:21 - let them make another guess print out
06:23 - what the result was so this is the parts
06:25 - that we want to repeat so what we're
06:27 - going to do is right before guess we're
06:29 - going to say while guess is not equal to
06:34 - secret that's what a conditional loop
06:37 - looks like we use the command while to
06:42 - say this is a loop that's going to
06:43 - happen while this part whatever this
06:46 - says is true so as long as guess is not
06:49 - equal to secret comes out true this loop
06:52 - will keep going but now all of this code
06:54 - needs to be indented so that's part of
06:57 - the while loop so what I'm going to do
06:59 - is highlight it all and press tab so it
07:01 - shifts it over so now all this code will
07:05 - repeat inside this while loop and then
07:08 - as soon as guess is equal to secret this
07:11 - part will be false so the loop will end
07:16 - so let's try running it and see what
07:18 - happens we got an error look what the
07:25 - error says it says the name guess is not
07:28 - defined when it tried to do the while
07:30 - loop so right here in our code we're
07:35 - getting an error can you see why let's
07:39 - think about what happens as the computer
07:42 - comes down from the top and picks a
07:44 - secret and then it gets here and it says
07:47 - well guess is not equal to secret
07:48 - well guess is not equal to anything yet
07:51 - guess doesn't exist we've never made a
07:52 - variable called guess yet so how can it
07:54 - compare
07:55 - guess to secret it doesn't know what it
07:58 - is so what we need to do is we need to
08:01 - give guests an initial value a starting
08:04 - value that the program begins with so it
08:07 - has something to compare so before this
08:10 - loop starts we need to set guess equal
08:12 - to something well I don't want to set it
08:15 - equal to the secret so I don't want to
08:17 - pick a number between 1 and 100 because
08:19 - what if the secret was 33 and 9 33 so
08:23 - let's set guess equal to zero okay and
08:27 - zero is not in this range so there's no
08:29 - way the secret can be zero so that means
08:32 - the first time the computer comes down
08:34 - here sets guests to zero is zero equal
08:36 - to the secret no it won't be so the loop
08:39 - will happen at least once and give the
08:41 - chance for a player to enter a guess all
08:46 - right let's run the program and see what
08:48 - happens all right so the secret number
08:52 - is 70 or we're still cheating and
08:54 - printing out what the secret is we're
08:55 - gonna have to change that in a minute
08:56 - but let's go ahead and make sure it's
08:58 - letting me try over and over again so if
09:00 - I guess 40 that's too low if I guess 80
09:03 - that's too high and if I guess 70 you
09:07 - got it and now the program ends so now
09:12 - we have everything working the way we
09:13 - want let's go ahead and add one more
09:15 - thing so first I'm going to remove this
09:18 - print secret line I don't want to print
09:20 - out the secret anymore I want to
09:21 - actually play the game okay and now I
09:24 - want to add one more thing I'd like to
09:25 - keep track of how many times the player
09:29 - guessed so they can have a score at the
09:32 - end to do that we're going to need
09:34 - another variable to keep track of the
09:36 - number of guesses so let's make that up
09:39 - here at the beginning we need to give it
09:41 - an initial value to what does it start
09:43 - with well the number of guesses should
09:45 - start at zero all right we haven't made
09:47 - any yet we'll call it tries so this will
09:49 - keep track of how many times I tried to
09:51 - answer the question so we want to add
09:54 - one two tries every time the player
09:57 - makes a guess so we can do that right
10:00 - here right after they make a guess we
10:02 - can say take tries and now set it equal
10:05 - to tries plus one
10:09 - if we run this program right now
10:11 - everything will work and tries will go
10:13 - up by one every time we make a guess but
10:16 - at the end of the game we won't see what
10:18 - our score was because we're never
10:19 - printing it out anywhere so down here at
10:21 - the bottom after this while loop ends so
10:24 - after we've finished guessing and we've
10:26 - gotten it right is where we want to
10:28 - print out the score so we don't want to
10:30 - indent here because we don't want this
10:32 - to be part of the loop we want it to
10:33 - happen after the loop is done and we
10:35 - just want to print out we'll say number
10:38 - of tries tries so let's run it now and
10:47 - see what happens okay no secret I don't
10:52 - know what the secret is so I'm going to
10:55 - guess 50 well 50 was too high so how
10:58 - about if I guess 30 30 is too low
11:01 - we'll try 40 we'll try 35 we'll try 38
11:09 - 37 I got it and I got it in six tries
11:13 - and now's a good time to go ahead and
11:16 - check and make sure that the program is
11:18 - counting correctly
11:20 - was it really six tries 1 2 3 4 5 6 ok
11:25 - it's working right it's always a good
11:27 - idea to double check and make sure you
11:29 - didn't make a mistake somewhere near
11:30 - program and the number comes out wrong
11:32 - and that's the number guessing game see
11:36 - you next time
11:45 - you
