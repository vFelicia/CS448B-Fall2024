00:00 - in this video we're going to tackle
00:02 - kinematic body
00:03 - and sliding on slopes
00:09 - okay so we've got an ordinary kinematic
00:10 - body here with
00:13 - pretty generic movement we had jumping
00:15 - and controls
00:17 - and we're using move and slide to do the
00:20 - movement
00:20 - and everything is fine but of course
00:23 - when we go on a slope
00:24 - we're going to see that we slide down
00:27 - and this is actually move and slide
00:29 - doing what it's supposed to do
00:31 - right our downward velocity that gravity
00:35 - is pulling us
00:36 - straight downwards is being slid along
00:38 - the surface
00:39 - and that's what movement slide is
00:41 - supposed to do so if we look at the
00:42 - kinematic body documentation
00:45 - we'll see the movement slide has a
00:46 - parameter called stop on slope
00:48 - that's false by default so let's go
00:51 - ahead and change that
00:53 - to true so instead of just doing move
00:56 - and slide
00:56 - with our velocity and our up vector
00:59 - we're going to do
01:00 - our velocity our up vector and then
01:02 - we're going to set stop on slope
01:04 - to true so what does that look like
01:08 - now when i go on the slope no sliding
01:13 - and you can see i'll go over here on the
01:14 - steeper one right we're not sliding on
01:16 - the slope at all
01:18 - uh we can still jump fine on the slope
01:22 - however if we do go to a really steep
01:24 - slope like this we're going to slide
01:25 - down and we'll talk about that
01:27 - more in a minute but you can see we're
01:29 - already
01:31 - pretty much getting what we want but
01:33 - there is a small problem which is really
01:34 - hard to see
01:36 - in this example because my gravity is
01:38 - kind of high
01:39 - which i wanted for good jumping but
01:41 - let's let's make the gravity really low
01:43 - just so you can see this problem a
01:45 - little bit better
01:47 - so with a really low gravity when i run
01:50 - up this slope
01:51 - you're going to see a little hop let me
01:53 - see that
01:55 - so when i stop moving or when i stop my
01:58 - input
01:59 - my velocity vector is being slid along
02:01 - the slope right so it has a forward
02:03 - component and an upward component
02:06 - and the forward component stops but
02:07 - there's still some upward
02:09 - momentum and that gets translated into
02:11 - this little bounce
02:13 - and looks a little odd you also get a
02:16 - little bit of a jump when you go off the
02:17 - slope
02:18 - and we don't want that either so what
02:21 - we're going to do to fix that
02:22 - is we're going to switch to move and
02:25 - slide
02:26 - with snap and so we're going to get our
02:29 - snap vector
02:30 - and it's just going to be pointing
02:32 - straight down
02:34 - now because i have jumping if we
02:37 - always had a downward snap vector then
02:39 - we'd never be able to jump because we'd
02:40 - be snapped to the ground no matter what
02:43 - so if we're not jumping we're going to
02:44 - be snapped to the ground but for jumping
02:46 - we're going to have a zero snap vector
02:48 - so move and slide with snap we have our
02:49 - velocity our snap vector
02:51 - our up vector and again stop on slope
02:55 - is true and you'll see that will get rid
02:58 - of
02:59 - the little jump that we are having right
03:02 - no more little jump
03:03 - when i stop moving okay so now
03:06 - everything is pretty good although
03:08 - my gravity is super low now uh so now
03:10 - everything is pretty good but you'll see
03:12 - we still
03:12 - of course have the problem over here
03:14 - we've got it definitely jumps and it
03:16 - slides and this slope is not working
03:19 - right
03:20 - why is that well the reason for that is
03:23 - that move and slide with snap is not
03:26 - considering this
03:27 - to be a slope because the default value
03:31 - for max floor angle
03:34 - is 45 degrees and so that means consider
03:38 - anything that's 45 degrees or less to be
03:41 - ground and you should stand on it
03:43 - anything above that should be considered
03:44 - a wall
03:45 - so this is considered a sloped wall not
03:47 - the ground so it's not being
03:50 - snapped to so what we want to do is
03:53 - to fix that if you want to have really
03:55 - steep slopes is
03:57 - change your move and slide with snap to
03:59 - also include
04:00 - floor max angle and see i've made it 52
04:03 - degrees
04:04 - because that's the angle of the slope
04:07 - that i made
04:08 - for this example and now this
04:11 - steep slope acts just the way we want it
04:15 - and i can still jump on it and all that
04:17 - kind of stuff
04:19 - okay so hopefully this helps you out
04:21 - with some
04:22 - of your problems you're having with
04:23 - kinematic bodies in 3d
04:27 - post below if you have any questions and
04:29 - i'll see you in a future video
