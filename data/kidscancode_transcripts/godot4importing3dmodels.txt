00:00 - welcome back to gdau recipes in this
00:02 - video we're going to be talking about
00:03 - how to import 3D assets into your gdau
00:06 - project for this demo we're going to use
00:08 - some art packs from K on
00:10 - itch.io and specifically we're going to
00:12 - use the dungeon remastered and the
00:15 - adventures character pack and these are
00:18 - just fantastic they're all really well
00:21 - done and the adventures pack you know
00:23 - has multiple characters and a ridiculous
00:26 - number of animations uh for each of them
00:29 - so this will be a really good example of
00:31 - how to get all sorts of different kinds
00:33 - of assets into good so download both of
00:36 - these and then we'll drag those into our
00:38 - project now the first thing you're going
00:40 - to notice when you unzip all of these is
00:42 - that there are multiple versions of all
00:44 - the files and we want to make sure we
00:46 - use the ones that are most compatible
00:48 - with good which are going to be the
00:50 - gltf
00:51 - versions and so in the adventures pack
00:55 - we're going to drag this character items
00:57 - folder the characters folder and then
01:00 - from the dungeon remasters we're going
01:01 - to grab the gltf folder and I drag those
01:05 - all three of those into my project
01:07 - folder here in my new good project and
01:10 - make sure that you give it a little time
01:12 - because there are a lot of files in
01:14 - these folders good is going to take a
01:16 - few seconds to scan through them all all
01:19 - right let's start with the characters
01:21 - and if you select the Knight here and
01:24 - look at the import
01:25 - tab you're going to see some of the
01:27 - basic import settings that we can change
01:30 - for this particular scene but I'm going
01:34 - to go ahead and click on Advanced here
01:35 - to pop up this window which gives us a
01:38 - lot more access to what's in the
01:41 - character and what we can do with it
01:43 - when we import it on the left you're
01:45 - going to see all the nodes that are
01:47 - going to be imported when we when we use
01:50 - this so there's a a whole bunch of
01:51 - meshes in here there's a skeleton with
01:53 - the rig and here you can see all the
01:58 - animations and the first thing I'm going
02:00 - to do is go over here to the root type
02:02 - and we're going to change this to
02:04 - character body 3D so that's the node
02:06 - type we're going to want our character
02:08 - to be when we use it and then I'm also
02:12 - going to go look at some of these
02:13 - animations so for example let's go find
02:15 - the idle
02:17 - animation and in the idle animation you
02:20 - want to make sure we want this animation
02:21 - to be looping when it's imported so
02:24 - you're going to need to go over here and
02:25 - pick linear it's going to be set to none
02:27 - I've already done it with this one set
02:29 - this to
02:30 - so that when it Imports it will
02:32 - automatically be a looping animation and
02:34 - some of them we want to do that like
02:36 - attacks we would want to only play once
02:39 - but idle the walking animations the
02:42 - running
02:44 - animations and the various idle
02:46 - animations we're going to want to set to
02:49 - looping so go ahead and do that with
02:50 - each of them and then click repport and
02:54 - you'll be good to go all right what
02:56 - about the dungeon items so down here
02:59 - here in the dungeon pack there are a
03:02 - huge number of files and it's kind of
03:04 - hard to just scroll through them I'm
03:06 - going to go ahead and put wall here in
03:08 - the filter so we can find the plain
03:12 - wall object and look at its import
03:15 - settings now the thing about the walls
03:16 - is we want them to be solid objects that
03:19 - we can't walk through and so we want to
03:21 - add Collision to these and it would be
03:23 - really
03:24 - tedious to go to each one and add a uh
03:27 - create it then add a static body then
03:29 - add a collision shape and so we can do
03:32 - this on import if we click on the mesh
03:35 - here we can say turn on physics and then
03:40 - it'll automatically choose static here
03:42 - we want it to be a static body and then
03:44 - we can choose how we want the Collision
03:45 - to be created to so like tresh we'll use
03:49 - the mesh itself to create the Collision
03:53 - which for this one isn't really all that
03:55 - necessary we don't care about these
03:56 - little bumps and everything uh so the
03:59 - simple convex is probably fine which
04:01 - just does an outline or you can use
04:03 - decompose convex which tries to make one
04:06 - uh you know with as few pieces as
04:09 - possible for this particular one it
04:11 - doesn't matter for different ones you'll
04:13 - need to look at what Collision shape
04:15 - works best for what that object's going
04:18 - to be but set that and click
04:20 - reimport all right so now once you've
04:23 - imported the scenes that you want let's
04:26 - go back to the Knight
04:28 - here
04:30 - and if you right click on it and say new
04:32 - inherited scene you'll get a new scene
04:36 - with this root character body 3D like we
04:39 - chose and underneath all of the nodes
04:42 - that came in from the glb file uh now
04:48 - one thing you'll notice is hands are
04:49 - kind of full because the artist has gone
04:53 - ahead and included all the different
04:55 - weapons and shields rigged and attached
04:58 - at the right place places so they'll
05:00 - work with the animations which is great
05:02 - and you can just go along and hide uh
05:05 - the ones you don't
05:07 - want so there I'm just leaving the
05:09 - one-handed Sword and the round
05:12 - shield and down here you'll see the
05:14 - animation player where you can sort of
05:16 - go and look at all the animations in
05:19 - individually and play them and see what
05:21 - they look like there's a a attack
05:24 - there's
05:25 - a block holds up the shield right you
05:28 - can play around with these and make sure
05:31 - they all look good and figure out which
05:34 - ones you want to use for your game
05:37 - notice idle here is in looping mode so
05:40 - when I play this that animation is going
05:43 - to just keep
05:45 - repeating and that's it once we've got
05:47 - our character imported the way we want
05:50 - it and we've imported all of the dungeon
05:52 - items we want that we can start building
05:54 - our dungeon with we're ready to start
05:56 - working on the game and we'll tackle
05:59 - that in the next part thanks for
