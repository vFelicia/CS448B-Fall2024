00:00 - welcome to part 4 of the circle jump
00:02 - series in this video we're gonna start
00:04 - making our menu screens so we have a
00:06 - number of different screens we're gonna
00:08 - make one for the title screen one for
00:10 - the GAMEOVER screen and also a settings
00:12 - screen so they're gonna all inherit or
00:16 - they're all gonna share a lot of
00:16 - property so we're gonna hair it from a
00:18 - base scene so I'm gonna make that base
00:21 - scene first with a canvas layer and I'm
00:27 - just gonna call this base screen I'm
00:32 - gonna save that in the UI folder so this
00:37 - is going to be all the things that my
00:39 - screens have in common well they're
00:41 - gonna start with a margin container set
00:45 - to full rect and custom constants set
00:51 - all these to 20 so that's gonna ensure
00:55 - that nothing in my on my screen gets too
00:58 - close to the edge and then we're gonna
01:01 - have some various things going from the
01:03 - top to the bottom so we're gonna use a
01:06 - bee box container for that the UV bucks
01:10 - container we can leave everything
01:14 - default I think so yeah we'll come back
01:19 - and mess with it if we have to probably
01:22 - want to space things out but in that V
01:25 - box container we're going to have a
01:29 - label this is going to be the title clip
01:34 - title here
01:34 - alright that's going to be centered and
01:38 - I need a font for that alright so that's
01:49 - my title of whatever screen I'm on and
01:52 - then underneath I'm going to have a row
01:55 - of buttons that row of buttons is going
01:58 - to be an H box container and I don't
02:04 - have any buttons to put in there yet the
02:06 - default screen doesn't have any but
02:07 - we'll put our ones for the various
02:10 - screens in there H box contain
02:13 - needs to align from the center and we'll
02:18 - probably have some separation and we're
02:22 - going to name this buttons and we're
02:25 - gonna duplicate it because we need to
02:26 - have two rows of buttons with the same
02:28 - properties and then lastly I'm going to
02:31 - add a tween here that's going to be for
02:34 - animating the title coming out or the
02:36 - screen coming on and going off of
02:39 - visibility and we're gonna start with
02:42 - our offset being 500 right we're gonna
02:46 - it's gonna start off over here and then
02:49 - move on to the screen with a script so
02:53 - we're going to add a base screen script
02:55 - this script is going to do pretty much
02:59 - nothing but the animation so we're going
03:02 - to get a reference to our tween and then
03:08 - we're gonna have two methods here appear
03:11 - and disappear and both of them will just
03:14 - be animating between we're going to
03:17 - interpolate the property the cell for
03:20 - self we're going to interpolate offset
03:22 - dot offset X and for a peer we're gonna
03:28 - go from 500 to zero go the next line
03:34 - here will go from half a second and
03:36 - we'll use we're gonna use tween dot
03:39 - trans back and ease in out and then
03:49 - we'll call tween dot start so that's up
03:52 - here and then I'm gonna copy that
03:56 - because the only difference between
03:59 - appear and disappear is that we're going
04:04 - to do the reverse motions we're gonna
04:06 - start it zero and go to 500 okay now we
04:12 - can make our first scene so we'll say a
04:14 - new inherited scene and inherit from the
04:17 - base scene we're gonna set our label up
04:21 - here this will be where we put the title
04:25 - now again these are going to be very
04:28 - no-frills to start with right we want to
04:31 - just get something functional before we
04:33 - spend too much time on making things
04:35 - look fancy and then we need to add some
04:39 - buttons in here and the buttons in the
04:42 - buttons row are going to be texture
04:45 - buttons so the texture button this is
04:48 - going to be I'm going to use the name of
04:50 - the buttons to define what they do
04:53 - because we're gonna have maybe a play
04:56 - button in more than one place so we have
04:58 - a play button the texture we're going to
05:00 - use is in the assets
05:06 - there's our play button and then we want
05:12 - to duplicate that actually before you
05:16 - duplicate that I'm gonna put that in a
05:18 - group called buttons because that will
05:23 - let us refer to these and get a list of
05:26 - all the buttons that we have title
05:30 - screen let's let's name that so we know
05:35 - what that's called so the play button
05:37 - I'm gonna duplicate and this is gonna be
05:39 - a button to call settings and for that
05:43 - we're gonna use a different image from
05:49 - the buttons we're gonna use the little
05:50 - gear drop that in there there's our
05:58 - button now one thing I noticed
05:59 - everything's very smooshed up against
06:01 - the top so in the base screen we'd
06:03 - probably want to space out yeah on this
06:06 - V box container something fairly large
06:10 - so that they'll be spaced out there we
06:13 - go
06:13 - titles at the top buttons near the
06:16 - center so that's pretty much all we have
06:20 - to do for our title screen and then the
06:24 - other scenes are going to be the same so
06:26 - I'm gonna do those real quick inherit
06:29 - another one from base screen which is
06:32 - gonna be our
06:36 - settings and the settings screen we
06:39 - actually need to we're going to need two
06:42 - rows of buttons so we're gonna say
06:44 - settings here we'll save that and then
06:50 - and there are buttons for settings we've
06:53 - got sound and music toggles and we have
06:55 - a Return button that'll take us back to
06:57 - the main screen and we have one more
07:00 - which is our game over screen and here's
07:05 - the game over screen which is gonna have
07:06 - a button that takes you home and a
07:08 - button lets you play again so to bring
07:10 - them all together we're going to make
07:12 - one more new scene I'm just going to use
07:15 - a plane node as a container for holding
07:22 - all these screens and in it we're gonna
07:26 - put our title screen settings screen and
07:30 - game over screen so I'll screw three
07:33 - screens or like a piled up on there but
07:35 - they're off the screen and this is where
07:38 - the switching is going to happen pulling
07:42 - onto the screen whichever one we want to
07:44 - see so we're going to have a we're going
07:51 - to need to send a start game signal to
07:52 - the main scene when we press that button
07:58 - we're gonna need to keep track of which
08:00 - screen is currently on and active and
08:05 - the ready
08:06 - we need to register all of our buttons
08:08 - right we need to connect them up so
08:10 - we're gonna make a function to do that
08:12 - call that here and then we're gonna also
08:15 - gonna have a change screen button which
08:18 - changes to whichever one we want title
08:21 - screen being the one we want to change
08:22 - to first so let's define those the
08:29 - register buttons is going to get get all
08:33 - the buttons that's get tree and we want
08:41 - to get nodes in group buttons right that
08:44 - will get us all the buttons that we made
08:48 - then we can go through them in a loop
08:51 - and connect their signals I'm going to
08:54 - connect the pressed signal to a function
08:58 - will make locally and it's gonna be
09:02 - called on button pressed and then we're
09:08 - gonna send along with it the buttons
09:14 - name so we know which one we pressed
09:19 - okay and then on button pressed name
09:28 - we'll determine which one we pressed so
09:33 - let's match match the name if we press
09:40 - the home button we want to change screen
09:45 - to the title screen if we press the play
09:53 - button then we want to change screen to
09:58 - no we want to have no screen active
10:01 - we're going to omit that signal so the
10:06 - game knows to start if we picked the
10:10 - Settings button we're gonna change
10:13 - screen to the setting screen and then we
10:19 - could press the sound and music ones but
10:21 - I don't have anything to do with those
10:22 - yet so we're gonna hold off on that and
10:25 - then we need to define our change screen
10:28 - function okay so when we change to a new
10:38 - screen first of all if there's a current
10:40 - screen right there maybe or there may
10:42 - not be if there's a current screen we
10:44 - need to make it disappear so the current
10:45 - screen disappear we just call its
10:48 - disappear function that we made and then
10:50 - we want to wait for its tween to
10:53 - complete
10:59 - between completed signal we wait for
11:02 - that to finish then we're going to set
11:05 - the current screen equal to a new screen
11:08 - and if new screen isn't null then we're
11:13 - gonna call current screen dot appear and
11:17 - do the exact same thing we will yield
11:20 - and wait for that tween to finish so now
11:26 - we can actually try it out if we run the
11:28 - screens by themselves we should see the
11:30 - title screen appear if we press settings
11:35 - we go to the settings screen these
11:37 - buttons don't do anything yet but return
11:39 - will take us back to home and play is
11:42 - going to start the game so we would we
11:44 - sent out the start game signal so we
11:47 - need to connect that to Main and we will
11:49 - have the game start but first we need
11:53 - also something to call if the game ends
11:56 - so we will make a game over function
12:03 - which is going to change screen to the
12:10 - game over screen we can call that from
12:14 - main so let's go over to our main and
12:17 - we're going to add in the screens
12:21 - collection and we can start connecting
12:24 - this stuff up so screens is going to
12:27 - have a signal start game we can connect
12:30 - that to our new game function that we
12:35 - already have we can stop calling new
12:39 - game and ready we don't want to do that
12:42 - so that should be enough for us to run
12:47 - it the game comes up when I hit play the
12:49 - game starts now the game starts a little
12:51 - too fast so I think we probably want in
12:55 - our screens function here to give a
12:57 - slight delay when we hit play we change
13:01 - screen to null and then we're going to
13:03 - yield
13:08 - create a timer let's just say for a half
13:11 - second and we'll wait for timeout now
13:16 - let's play the game title screen comes
13:18 - up we can still bounce around from menu
13:22 - to menu but when we hit play the game
13:26 - starts playing now we need to do
13:28 - something when we end when we go off the
13:31 - screen so let's open our jumper and
13:34 - we're going to add a signal died so will
13:38 - this little emit when we die and right
13:42 - now we have a die of functions we are
13:46 - removing ourselves but we need to emit
13:49 - that signal and then in main we can
13:56 - connect that signal just like we did
13:58 - with its captured connect the died
14:06 - signaled to on jumper died and then so
14:14 - what do we need to do when the jumper
14:15 - died when the jumper dies I want all the
14:19 - circles to go away and it's the easiest
14:21 - way to do that is if we go over to our
14:23 - circle scene a circle node we're going
14:26 - to add that to make a group for that
14:29 - then in our main script what we can do
14:33 - is just call get tree let me say call
14:37 - group which let's just call a function
14:40 - on every member of a group so on circles
14:43 - we'll call our implode function on our
14:48 - squill call game over on our screens
14:53 - okay that should do it
14:54 - so let's give it a try here's our play
14:59 - screen we play when we go off the screen
15:01 - we get game over we play again right we
15:06 - can keep playing
15:07 - let's check the timeout on the circle oh
15:14 - we saw the game over screen twice that
15:17 - means our signal our player
15:19 - be sending out the signal twice why is
15:22 - the player sending out the signal twice
15:24 - well over here we call jump or die right
15:29 - when the circle runs out which is fine
15:31 - but on the jumper when we do die we send
15:35 - out the signal but Q free deletes the
15:39 - jumper when the jumper is deleted it
15:43 - triggers this screen exited signal on
15:46 - the visibility notifier and it's calling
15:47 - died again so what we need to do is only
15:50 - send out this signal here and that will
15:55 - solve that let's go ahead and let the
15:58 - circle run out and make sure there we go
16:06 - okay that'll do it for this part thanks
16:09 - for watching I'll see you in the next
16:11 - one don't forget to subscribe so you can
16:14 - see the next update when it comes out
16:16 - we're getting pretty close to having the
16:18 - full working framework of the game so we
16:20 - can start talking about how we're going
16:22 - to get this on to mobile all right I'll
16:26 - see you in the next video
16:34 - you
