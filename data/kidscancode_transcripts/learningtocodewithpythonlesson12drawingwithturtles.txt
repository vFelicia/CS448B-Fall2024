00:00 - welcome to learning to code with python
00:02 - I'm Chris Bradfield and I'll be your
00:03 - instructor for this series these videos
00:05 - are intended for students ages 11 to 14
00:08 - or about grades 5 to8 if you're younger
00:11 - than that you can still give it a try
00:12 - but you might want to get help from an
00:14 - adult we're going to be doing a lot of
00:16 - typing before we get started make sure
00:19 - you've already installed python on your
00:20 - computer if you haven't stop the video
00:23 - now and click on the link below for
00:25 - instructions you will probably need to
00:27 - get your parents help for that part if
00:29 - you have any questions about this lesson
00:31 - or any other lessons click on asking for
00:34 - help under the video that's the best way
00:37 - if you leave a comment on YouTube I
00:38 - might not see it or you might not see my
00:41 - answer today we're going to talk about
00:44 - turtles and when I say turtle I don't
00:46 - mean the cute little animal with the
00:48 - shell I'm actually talking about a robot
00:51 - in the early days of computing some
00:52 - scientists created a robot that looked
00:54 - kind of like the one in this picture and
00:56 - they called it Turtle because of its
00:58 - shape the purpose of this robot was to
01:01 - draw and so it had a pen attached to it
01:04 - the way it worked was you would put a
01:05 - large piece of paper on the ground and
01:07 - as the turtle drove around it would
01:08 - leave a trail by giving it different
01:10 - commands you could create all kinds of
01:12 - shapes and designs and that's what we're
01:14 - going to do today only instead of using
01:16 - a robot and paper we're going to use the
01:19 - computer so let's open up our python
01:21 - shell like we learned to do in our first
01:24 - video to make our Turtle appear we'll
01:27 - need to type two commands the first one
01:30 - is import Turtle now you're going to see
01:33 - the import command quite a bit as You
01:35 - Learn Python import tells the computer
01:38 - what kind of commands you're going to
01:40 - need for your program in this case we
01:42 - want it to load or import the commands
01:44 - for working with Turtle
01:46 - Graphics now that we've imported the
01:48 - turtle commands let's make a turtle
01:51 - here's the command for
01:56 - that now I'm naming my turtle Fred you
01:59 - can use a different name later but let's
02:01 - just stick with Fred for now also do you
02:03 - notice that capital P that's important
02:06 - if you type a lowercase p things will
02:08 - not work
02:09 - correctly so now we have our Turtle
02:12 - window let's arrange these two windows
02:15 - next to each other we'll be typing over
02:17 - here in the shell and seeing what the
02:19 - turtle does over
02:21 - here now I know what you're thinking
02:23 - that doesn't look like a turtle it's
02:25 - just an arrow well I agree I'd also like
02:27 - my turtle to look like a turtle so let's
02:29 - do that first we're going to tell Fred
02:31 - to change his
02:37 - shape there we go that's better this is
02:40 - what most of our Turtle commands are
02:42 - going to look like the name of the
02:43 - turtle Fred a DOT and then what command
02:47 - we want it to do so now we're ready to
02:49 - draw let's see what Fred can do first
02:52 - let's tell him to move
02:54 - forward fred.
02:58 - forward 100 now before I press enter I'd
03:03 - like you to think about what that 100
03:05 - stands
03:06 - for do you think it means inches
03:10 - centimeters no Fred exists inside the
03:12 - computer he doesn't know what inches or
03:14 - centimeters are Fred measures everything
03:16 - in pixels if you were to look really
03:19 - really closely at your computer screen
03:21 - you'd see it's made up of lots and lots
03:23 - of tiny little dots those little dots
03:26 - are called pixels depending on your
03:28 - screen they may be really hard to
03:31 - see so let's see Fred
03:35 - move so we told Fred to go forward 100
03:38 - pixels and he left a trail behind him
03:41 - now let's tell him to turn
03:46 - left and the argument remember that's
03:49 - the stuff that's inside the
03:51 - parenthesis the argument for left is not
03:53 - in pixels it's in
03:55 - degrees a full circle is 360Â° so telling
03:59 - him to turn 90 means he's now pointing
04:01 - up on the screen if we tell him to go
04:04 - forward
04:08 - again then that's the direction he moves
04:11 - in so let's try repeating those commands
04:14 - a few more
04:26 - times there we've made a square
04:31 - so let's try a few more commands and by
04:33 - the way this might be a good time to
04:35 - pause and practice these commands before
04:38 - you go on with the
04:41 - video all right let's try a few more
04:44 - commands fred. reset is
04:47 - useful basically tells Fred to erase
04:50 - everything he's drawn go back to the
04:51 - medal and start over again at the
04:54 - beginning so let's tell Fred to change
04:57 - his
04:58 - color the color command lets you type
05:01 - the name of a color and Fred will change
05:04 - to that color if we try to
05:08 - move now we're drawing in that
05:11 - color feel free to pick a different
05:13 - color other than red Fred knows quite a
05:16 - lot of them if you want to see the full
05:18 - list and it's a big one there's a link
05:20 - below the video to a website where you
05:22 - can see all the colors that Fred knows
05:24 - how to do feel free to pause and go take
05:27 - a look at
05:28 - it
05:31 - another command that we're going to try
05:33 - out is
05:36 - circle the circle takes as an
05:40 - argument the number for how big we want
05:43 - the circle to be in our case here we
05:45 - want the circle to have a radius of
05:48 - 100 radius means the distance from the
05:50 - center to the edge so our Circle will
05:53 - look like
05:56 - that we can also put
06:00 - a
06:01 - minus into the circle arguments what do
06:04 - you think that'll do well let's
06:09 - see it drew a circle the same size but
06:12 - started going in the opposite
06:17 - direction let's go ahead and
06:19 - reset and let's try another color let's
06:24 - do blue this
06:26 - time now sometimes when you're drawing
06:30 - you want to draw shapes that aren't
06:31 - connected to each other so for example
06:34 - if we went
06:36 - forward and then I wanted to draw a
06:39 - circle that wasn't attached to this line
06:42 - what would I do well that's where the
06:45 - command up comes in handy up tells Fred
06:48 - to pick his pen up so it's no longer
06:50 - touching the
06:52 - paper so that means now if we were to
06:54 - move forward
06:58 - oops
07:00 - we would move without leaving a line so
07:02 - we can move to where we want to go and
07:04 - then when we're ready to draw again we
07:07 - tell Fred to put the pen
07:10 - down and then if we
07:13 - draw there we go we've got shapes that
07:15 - aren't connected to each
07:17 - other now might be a good time to talk
07:20 - about what happens if we make a mistake
07:23 - now some of you have probably seen this
07:25 - already but what happens if I make a
07:29 - mistake and I spell the command
07:33 - wrong well I get a bunch of scary Red
07:36 - text that says I made an
07:38 - error you need to get used to the idea
07:41 - of looking at these error messages and
07:43 - trying to understand what they
07:44 - mean usually the most important part of
07:47 - the error is this last line down here at
07:49 - the bottom let's look what it says
07:51 - Turtle object has no attribute for wad
07:55 - well if I were to pay attention to what
07:57 - I'd been typing I'd realize well of
07:59 - course it gave an error message I
08:00 - spelled forward
08:02 - wrong so let's try it
08:05 - again and spell it right there we go get
08:10 - in the habit of trying to figure out
08:12 - what those error messages are telling
08:14 - you look very carefully at what you
08:16 - typed most of the time it's going to be
08:20 - a simple mistake because you spelled
08:21 - something
08:24 - wrong all right let's stop there and
08:27 - review everything we've learned so far
08:30 - to create our Turtle we needed to type
08:32 - these two commands in the red
08:35 - box if you quit the python shell and
08:38 - start it again you'll need to type these
08:40 - two commands to get your turtle window
08:42 - back we learned how to tell the turtle
08:45 - to move forward and remember the number
08:47 - in the parentheses the argument is in
08:51 - pixels we learned how to turn left and
08:55 - as you might imagine you can also turn
08:57 - right we learn to draw draw a circle we
09:01 - learn to change the color and don't
09:03 - forget the color name needs to have the
09:05 - quotes around it or it won't work
09:07 - right we learned how to pick up or put
09:09 - down the pen so that we're either
09:11 - drawing or moving without
09:13 - drawing and we learned about reset which
09:16 - wipes the window clean and lets Fred
09:18 - start over again with a whole new
09:20 - drawing and I'm going to leave this one
09:23 - bonus command here at the bottom and I'm
09:24 - not going to tell you what it does go
09:26 - ahead and try it out and see if you can
09:28 - find out for yourself
09:30 - all right go and make some drawings see
09:33 - what you can make try drawing a stick
09:35 - figure a snowman a house whatever you
09:39 - might want to try and I'll see you in
09:41 - the next
09:46 - lesson
