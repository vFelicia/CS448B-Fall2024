00:00 - welcome back this is part 7 of the
00:02 - top-down tank battle tutorial for Godot
00:05 - 3.0 in this installment we're gonna add
00:07 - some health bars to our enemy units so
00:09 - that we can see their current health and
00:12 - we're gonna add some explosions to our
00:14 - bullets that were firing alright let's
00:17 - get started in the last part we made the
00:20 - health bar for the player so that we
00:22 - could see their health decreasing and we
00:25 - added damage to the enemy tank but we
00:28 - didn't make it display so we're gonna
00:31 - add a little health bar for the enemy
00:34 - units that are on the screen and unlike
00:37 - the player where we have it up in the
00:39 - corner we want this to be a little bar
00:42 - that is above the unit as it dries
00:44 - around so you can see how much damage
00:45 - that particular unit has taken so we
00:49 - want it to follow along with them so
00:50 - we're gonna make this as a separate
00:52 - scene that we're gonna save in the UI
00:54 - folder that's going to be something that
00:56 - we can attach to any enemy unit if we
00:59 - wanted to have a health bar so I'm just
01:02 - gonna use a node 2d for this to hold
01:06 - everything I'm gonna call this the unit
01:08 - display and I don't really know yet what
01:13 - things what other things we might have
01:16 - these units display like maybe they have
01:18 - invulnerability or maybe they have you
01:21 - know some special powers or things but
01:23 - one thing we know that they are going to
01:25 - have is a is a health bar so we're gonna
01:29 - add a texture progress here to be their
01:31 - health bar and this will work pretty
01:36 - similarly to how we did it on the player
01:38 - it's just that this is gonna follow them
01:40 - around instead okay so we're going to
01:43 - put the green progress bar in there for
01:46 - the progress texture I'm gonna set it to
01:48 - a hundred value so we can see the whole
01:51 - bar so here's my unit display node that
01:55 - we're gonna attach to the unit and
01:57 - here's the bar so what I really want is
01:59 - I want that bar to be kind of the enemy
02:04 - unit and since it's attached to gonna be
02:07 - attached to the unit that means when the
02:09 - unit moves and rotates so is the bar
02:12 - right as the unit goes around the
02:14 - bar would be doing this too and we don't
02:17 - want that so we're gonna want to make
02:18 - sure that we disable the rotation of
02:22 - that but we do want it to move and
02:24 - follow along with the unit as it moves
02:28 - around so as this moves around the bar
02:30 - follows it around wherever it goes and
02:35 - this is also a little bit large so I'm
02:38 - going to set the scale of this to one
02:42 - half and we'll see how that works we can
02:45 - also adjust it on individual units when
02:48 - we attach it to them if they're bigger
02:51 - or smaller now what do we want this bar
02:55 - to do we're going to attach a script to
02:58 - it and we want this to do kind of the
03:02 - same thing that the one we made for the
03:05 - player did where we have the we're gonna
03:08 - have the bar texture colors I'm gonna
03:11 - copy these over there and the update
03:15 - health bar I am going to copy some of
03:21 - this but we're not going to copy
03:22 - everything so we're not gonna do it
03:24 - exactly the same and maybe these will
03:27 - have more similarities maybe they won't
03:30 - I'm not entirely sure yet but for now we
03:35 - want these to be the health bar we'll
03:39 - just change its texture directly health
03:45 - bar texture health bar dot texture
03:49 - progress is what we want to set to the
03:53 - texture part Express and we want to set
04:01 - the health bar value equals value so
04:09 - that's what that function does now I
04:12 - also want that bar not to display until
04:17 - the enemy takes some damage so when it's
04:20 - at full health I don't want the bar to
04:22 - even be there and so I'm gonna do this
04:25 - I'm gonna I'm gonna get all the children
04:28 - and I'm going to set them to to be
04:32 - invisible when the note first starts up
04:35 - and then we'll enable them as you know
04:38 - depending on what they're displaying as
04:39 - we need to display them so now if I go
04:42 - over to the to an enemy tank and I
04:48 - attach this go to 2d here we want the
04:52 - enemy tank seen and we're going to
04:56 - attach a unit display to it so there's
04:59 - my unit display and if I were to run
05:05 - this what we're not going to see them
05:07 - yet because they are hidden but let me
05:12 - disable that for a second because I want
05:14 - to let's disable that for a second so
05:20 - that we can see what I'm talking about
05:23 - with the rotation so see there's the bar
05:28 - kind of rotating along with the enemy
05:33 - note and I don't like that I don't want
05:34 - that to happen so so what we're going to
05:37 - do in the unit display here is we're
05:39 - going to in its process function we're
05:46 - going to set the global rotation to zero
05:50 - so that way no matter how the parent
05:54 - turns this one will always be not turned
05:57 - and I'm actually going to move this up a
06:00 - little bit to I didn't like how close it
06:04 - was so now we can see this in the in the
06:10 - view but when we hit run yeah there you
06:16 - see it staying on top of the enemy unit
06:19 - so as it turns so let me get over here
06:22 - to the turn so as it turns that bar
06:26 - stays horizontal okay so now all we need
06:30 - to do is have it update when the tank
06:34 - takes a hit so we'll go over to our
06:37 - enemy tank scene and because we're
06:39 - inheriting from
06:41 - the tank script the main tank script we
06:45 - already know that when we take damage
06:47 - we're emitting the signal so in the
06:49 - enemy tank scene we just have to connect
06:52 - that signal so we connect health changed
06:55 - to the unit displays update health bar
07:01 - and that should all be all we need and
07:05 - I'll uncomment this so that we'll have
07:08 - the bars hidden when we start so there
07:12 - is no bar and I'll start shooting it now
07:18 - it's taking damage but what did we
07:21 - forget to do we forgot to show it so we
07:24 - also want to go over here and in the
07:26 - script say that if the value is less
07:29 - than a hundred we want health bar dot
07:33 - show and now I run the main scene when
07:41 - we go over here and shoot it remember it
07:44 - has 50 health so be hitting it with 5 or
07:46 - 5 ok so the other thing I wanted to do
07:51 - this time is talk about explosions so I
07:54 - have two different styles of explosion
07:58 - animations here in a folder in the
08:01 - assets these are actually taken from the
08:04 - original sprite sheet but it's really
08:06 - kind of annoying to cut them all out in
08:10 - the regions and so instead I just used
08:13 - the individual frames because we're
08:15 - gonna make an animated sprite for this
08:16 - so we're gonna make a new scene and it's
08:19 - gonna have one note in it an animated
08:21 - sprite this is going to be called
08:24 - explosion and for this I'm going to make
08:30 - an effects folder this will be the first
08:34 - of several effects that we're gonna make
08:38 - and animated sprite you need to create a
08:42 - sprite frames resource to hold the
08:45 - animations and we're gonna have to
08:46 - there's a smoke explosion and there's a
08:50 - fire explosion that we can use for two
08:54 - different kinds of effects both of them
08:56 - need to be set to about 10 FPS maybe
09:03 - even faster we'll see what we decide to
09:06 - do with those and then they also are
09:09 - going to need the frames dragged in
09:12 - there so you can what you can do is if
09:14 - I'm on the fire there's five frames
09:17 - total I can just drag them over like
09:19 - this and then in smoke select those and
09:24 - drag those over so now I have those two
09:27 - so this explosion will be able to attach
09:29 - to any object as well and will just
09:33 - trigger it to play if it needs to so the
09:37 - first place we're gonna attach one of
09:38 - these is gonna be on the bullets because
09:41 - I want the bullets to look like they're
09:42 - you know exploding when they hit
09:44 - something so let's take one of these
09:47 - explosions and I'm going to attach it to
09:49 - the bullet and we'll go over here to
09:54 - effect explosion so when I have the
09:58 - explosion there but of course I don't
10:00 - want it to be blocking our view of the
10:02 - bullet I don't want to show until the
10:03 - end so I'm gonna set that to hidden by
10:06 - default and then in the code we're just
10:09 - gonna have it trigger we already have an
10:12 - explosion we already have an explosion
10:16 - effect so let me see here where's my
10:18 - root bullet seen here this okay so we
10:22 - already have this explode method that
10:24 - plays when the bullet hits something so
10:28 - what we're going to do instead is have
10:29 - it play the animation so here let's see
10:35 - we want to take
10:38 - this explode and we're gonna say so when
10:42 - the bullet hits something or time runs
10:45 - out it's going to explode so we want to
10:48 - set our velocity equal to zero so it
10:51 - looks like it's stopped moving
10:52 - I want the explosion to happen in that
10:55 - position not to keep moving we're going
10:58 - to hide the sprite so we don't see the
11:01 - bullet itself anymore we're gonna show
11:05 - the explosion and we're gonna play the
11:08 - explosion we're gonna play the smoke one
11:16 - okay and then when the explosion
11:19 - finishes it's going to emit its
11:21 - animation finished and that will be when
11:27 - we cue free okay so here's what that's
11:34 - going to look like yes now whenever I
11:41 - shoot my bullets they have some nice
11:44 - explosions they're a little bit on the
11:47 - large side because you know we want to
11:50 - be able to scale these explosions as
11:51 - well so I'm gonna set the we'll set the
11:56 - default scale for this on the bullet and
12:00 - then we can change it on other things to
12:04 - be a different size if we want see how
12:07 - that looks
12:11 - yeah that's what we want I think the
12:14 - speed is a little on the slow side so
12:17 - we're gonna go back over to the
12:18 - explosion sprite frames and maybe make
12:22 - these 15 we can also alter those on a
12:29 - per
12:29 - explosion basis too if we ever need to
12:35 - okay alright so that's all working the
12:43 - way we want it all right now one last
12:46 - thing I was thinking about doing I'm not
12:50 - entirely sure I want to do it or not but
12:51 - it was in the UI assets that I
12:54 - downloaded is these custom cursors here
12:59 - so if you want to see what it looks like
13:01 - we're gonna go into the map and in the
13:06 - ready we're going to tell it we want to
13:09 - use that as our cursor so that is an
13:12 - input function so input set custom mouse
13:16 - cursor and we're gonna load the one I
13:22 - think looked better was the crosshair
13:25 - black not that line one this one copy
13:30 - that path and then you can paste that in
13:33 - there and then the other parameters you
13:37 - have to this function are which type of
13:40 - cursor it is so arrow means the default
13:44 - pointer style so that's the one we're
13:46 - gonna replace and then where do you want
13:49 - the hotspot or the actual clicking point
13:53 - to be and I'm gonna put zero zero which
13:56 - is not gonna be correct just so you can
13:58 - see that what I mean what what it's
14:00 - talking about so if I hit run you'll see
14:03 - now we have the crosshair but watch
14:05 - where the bullet goes when I click right
14:07 - because what happens is it's using the
14:09 - upper left corner of the crosshair as
14:12 - the hot spot like the tip of the arrow
14:16 - if we were using an arrow so since the
14:18 - cursor is 32 by 32 we want the hotspot
14:22 - to be at 16
14:23 - sixteen and that's gonna give us the
14:25 - best you know aim where it shoots
14:29 - straight at the center of that crosshair
14:32 - and again I'm not entirely sure yet how
14:36 - much custom cursor stuff I want to do
14:39 - but it's kind of fun to mess around with
14:41 - right now and I think that'll do it for
14:44 - this video as always thanks for watching
14:46 - and I'll see you in the next installment
14:57 - you
