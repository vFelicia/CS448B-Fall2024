00:00 - hi welcome to my new series Godot 101
00:03 - this playlist will be an introduction to
00:05 - the Godot game engine and how it works
00:07 - if you've never used a game engine
00:09 - before or if you're just new to judo
00:10 - this is the place to start if you're new
00:13 - here a quick note about the channel name
00:14 - we're called kidskin code because I
00:16 - teach programming and game development
00:18 - to kids but if you're an adult you're
00:19 - welcome here to the material isn't
00:21 - dumbed down and we'll probably be
00:23 - challenging no matter what your age now
00:26 - let's get started so what is a game
00:28 - engine well many of you have probably
00:31 - heard of unity unity is the 500-pound
00:34 - gorilla in the game industry many many
00:37 - companies big and small use it you've
00:41 - probably played unity games whether you
00:43 - realize it or not
00:45 - tons of people use it but it does have
00:48 - some drawbacks frankly I'm not a huge
00:51 - fan of it I think it's a little quirky
00:52 - and especially if you're trying to do 2d
00:57 - games and I enjoy making 2d games unity
01:00 - is not very good at doing it you know
01:03 - it's really 3d focused and the 2d stuff
01:06 - is kind of an afterthought which makes
01:08 - it difficult and there's tons of
01:11 - resources out there on unity unity is
01:14 - not free
01:16 - technically it's free until you make a
01:18 - certain amount of money so if you're
01:20 - using it just to make your own things
01:21 - yes you won't have to pay any money but
01:25 - it is a it is proprietary software and
01:29 - that's the way that that engine works
01:33 - what we're going to be talking about
01:35 - here is in these videos is the Godot
01:37 - engine like Godot is very similar in
01:41 - scope and in features and in all the
01:44 - stuff that it can do to unity the big
01:48 - upsides in my mind of Godot are one that
01:51 - it's free right as you can see right
01:53 - here on the webpage it's MIT license
01:56 - which means it's 100% open source and
01:58 - free you can download the source code to
02:00 - the engine you can change it however you
02:02 - want you can do whatever you want with
02:04 - it you will never ever have to pay a
02:08 - dollar to anyone for using it also it's
02:11 - really good at doing
02:13 - it does 3d great as well and we'll get
02:15 - into that too but it does 2d great right
02:18 - out of the box and like I said before
02:21 - you know for beginners when you're just
02:23 - getting started out with game
02:24 - development
02:25 - I really suggest you start with TV it's
02:28 - a lot less complicated than 3d and she's
02:32 - trying to work in 3d when you're just
02:34 - starting out you're really just fighting
02:36 - off more than you can chew and and it's
02:38 - going to be a lot harder
02:39 - and once you but once you get 2d you
02:41 - know under your belt and you're really
02:42 - solid with it
02:43 - stepping up to 3d will be a lot easier
02:46 - that also makes it a great choice
02:48 - because all the same tools and processes
02:52 - that you learn to use in doing 2d will
02:55 - be the same ones you use to make a game
02:57 - in 3d so the transition will be a lot
02:59 - easier so what is a game engine well
03:04 - it's kind of a loose term that gets used
03:06 - to mean a lot of different things by
03:07 - different people but in general a game
03:10 - engine is one that provides you a
03:13 - framework where you can focus on making
03:16 - the game and you don't have to write the
03:18 - code to do all the underlying things
03:21 - like in it you know like it says here
03:23 - has a rendering engine that's the thing
03:25 - that produces the graphics in 2d or 3d
03:29 - so you don't have to figure out how to
03:31 - calculate you know pixel movements and
03:34 - things like that it might have a physics
03:36 - engine in it so that you can hit handle
03:38 - collisions and realistic physics without
03:41 - having to write the code for that sounds
03:44 - animation networking all these kind of
03:48 - things are included in there and you
03:51 - just use them and put them together to
03:54 - make your game and there's lots of game
03:56 - engines out there with varying amounts
03:58 - of support for these different things
04:01 - and using different languages to write
04:04 - the code in and supporting different
04:07 - platforms for publishing your games
04:08 - that's another great thing about the
04:10 - dough is you can publish your game to
04:14 - just about any platform if you want to
04:16 - turn it into a web game if you want to
04:18 - distribute it on Linux PC Mac if you
04:23 - want to go mobile
04:24 - it supports iOS and Android
04:27 - and there are games out there on all
04:28 - those platforms that people have made
04:29 - indigo so it's definitely possible to
04:32 - put your game wherever you want it to go
04:33 - so before we start working with Godot
04:36 - let's talk about a couple of concepts
04:38 - and fundamentals to using Godot is the
04:42 - concept of nodes everything in Godot is
04:45 - a node and the node might be anything it
04:49 - might be a sprite it might be an
04:50 - animation it might be a sound but
04:54 - everything is a node and every node is
04:57 - going to have a name it's going to have
05:01 - all sorts of properties that define how
05:03 - it works and what it does it's going to
05:06 - have callback functions that means ways
05:10 - to make the node react to things you can
05:13 - send commands to the nodes have it do
05:15 - things and it's extendable meaning you
05:18 - can write code to make the Duce node do
05:21 - more things than it already does so
05:25 - everything is a node and nodes are
05:27 - arranged in what's called a tree and a
05:32 - tree just means that every node is going
05:35 - to have one parent only one parent and
05:40 - any node can have any number of children
05:43 - and they're arranged in this hierarchy
05:47 - so that you know this node here is a
05:51 - child of this node and this node is a
05:53 - child of this node and this would be at
05:56 - the top of the tree and so for example
06:00 - if you were to take a tree like this any
06:04 - tree of nodes grouped together in Godot
06:07 - is called a scene so here's an example
06:10 - of a scene we have a sprite that sprite
06:14 - has two children one is an animation
06:16 - node and one of them area 2d node that
06:19 - might be what something we're using to
06:21 - set up its physics and then that area to
06:25 - denote has a collision node that maybe
06:28 - says it's circular collision maybe has a
06:31 - shape and then maybe there's some other
06:33 - nodes attached to them altogether this
06:36 - makes a scene and
06:39 - so nodes and themes are fundamental to
06:42 - how you build everything in the dough
06:45 - okay so let's take a look at Godot when
06:48 - you first open it this is what you're
06:49 - going to see this is the project manager
06:51 - we're going to see a list of all the
06:53 - different Godot projects you might be
06:55 - working on and I've got a few here
06:56 - already that are going to be used for
06:58 - some upcoming videos but what you're
07:01 - going to want to do is going to want to
07:02 - click on new project and it's going to
07:05 - ask you first where you want to store
07:07 - this so if you hit browse you can be
07:09 - able to choose what folder to put your
07:11 - project in and I've been putting all of
07:14 - my stuff in a folder called game dev
07:16 - underscore Godot so I'm just going to
07:18 - click create folder and make one called
07:22 - test one for this example okay and it's
07:26 - going to make that folder and you're
07:28 - going to hit open
07:29 - alright that puts that here so now this
07:32 - is the place where it's going to save
07:34 - this and the name of it will be the same
07:38 - or different if you want to type
07:39 - something else and just hit create and
07:41 - then you'll see it added to the list and
07:43 - then anytime you want to open a project
07:45 - just click on it and click Edit this is
07:49 - what you're going to see when you first
07:50 - open a new project in Godot now it's
07:53 - easy to get overwhelmed at first because
07:54 - it's going to be a lot going on but for
07:56 - now we're going to keep it simple and
07:58 - just start with the basics this Center
08:00 - window here is your view of the game
08:03 - using the buttons at the top we can
08:05 - switch between 2d and 3d modes so let's
08:09 - click on 2d and stick with that for now
08:12 - okay over here on the right you're going
08:15 - to feel a box labeled scene remember we
08:18 - just learned that in Godot a scene is
08:20 - just a collection of nodes so let's add
08:22 - a node to this scene by clicking on the
08:25 - plus button here and you'll notice
08:27 - there's a tooltip there telling you what
08:29 - the button does and you can also see the
08:31 - keyboard shortcut mehta by the way just
08:34 - means command key if you're on Mac for
08:37 - the control key if you're on Windows so
08:40 - let's click that plus button so now we
08:42 - have this window asking us to choose
08:44 - what kind of node you want to create and
08:46 - as you can see there are a lot of notes
08:50 - and they all do different things and
08:52 - this is where you might start feeling
08:54 - overwhelmed going how am I ever going to
08:57 - learn how to use all of these things and
09:00 - what do they all mean so don't worry
09:02 - about that we're going to start small
09:03 - we're going to start with a few of them
09:04 - and over time you will start to use some
09:07 - of them and who knows what whatever game
09:09 - you're making you may not use some of
09:11 - these nodes you might not have any use
09:12 - for them so you can look through them
09:14 - and you can see they're kind of arranged
09:16 - in a hierarchy the green nodes are all
09:19 - about GUI functions about creating user
09:25 - interface the blue nodes here the bluish
09:28 - purple nodes are all about 2d nodes and
09:32 - then down here these reddish ones are
09:35 - all about 3d nodes and then there's a
09:39 - few miscellaneous ones down here that
09:40 - are in yellow and white but we don't
09:43 - need to worry about all that and you
09:45 - don't have to scroll through and find
09:46 - things either you can always just find
09:48 - the ones you want by clicking or by
09:51 - typing here so I'm going to type sprite
09:53 - and you see it's going to narrow down
09:56 - the search to all the nodes that have
09:59 - sprite in the name and this 2d sprite
10:02 - this is the one we want okay and so
10:06 - we're going to click create and now we
10:09 - have a sprite that has been created here
10:13 - in our scene and here in our game window
10:15 - we can see it's been put up here in the
10:19 - corner and you can grab the scroll bars
10:21 - and move over if you want to look at
10:24 - that part you can also I'm going to
10:28 - click with the middle mouse button and
10:29 - drag and that lets me just Pan my view
10:33 - around and look at different parts of
10:34 - the window you can zoom in by scrolling
10:40 - your mouse wheel in and out the sprite
10:43 - doesn't have really much going on
10:46 - because it doesn't look like anything so
10:49 - the first thing we knew is we need to
10:50 - give it an image now we don't have any
10:51 - images here yet but every new photo
10:55 - project has to be go icon in it and this
10:58 - is a little image file that we are going
11:00 - to use very popular for using in
11:03 - toriel dude it's already there so how do
11:06 - we set up our sprite well now it's time
11:09 - to look at the inspector tabs yes this
11:12 - window tells us we're looking at a
11:15 - sprite and this is all the information
11:19 - about it these are all the different
11:20 - settings that you can set on that sprite
11:24 - and to start with the one we care about
11:27 - is this one called texture right now it
11:30 - doesn't know because there's nothing in
11:32 - the texture property and you can click
11:35 - the down arrow here and there's some
11:36 - options here of things you can do so
11:39 - let's not worry about that what we're
11:41 - going to do is we're going to take this
11:43 - Widow icon and I'm going to drag it over
11:46 - here and drop it into that spot so now
11:50 - my sprite has this image as its texture
11:56 - and now let's grab that and we'll drag
12:00 - it out and put it in the middle of the
12:02 - scene because we don't want it to be up
12:04 - there in the corner and if I see them
12:06 - out here you can see this might be hard
12:09 - to see on the video but on your screen
12:10 - you should see this purple line that is
12:12 - going to be your game window when you
12:14 - run your game so let's put it somewhere
12:16 - in the middle here so that we'll see
12:18 - this right there we're ready to see what
12:21 - this will look like but if you notice up
12:23 - here it says unsaved well this hasn't
12:25 - been saved so we need to save this scene
12:27 - and if we click on scene here we can
12:29 - click save and you see the shortcut is
12:31 - meta F so I'm just going to hit command
12:34 - F and it's going to ask me to save it
12:37 - and it's going to give it a suggested
12:38 - filename right dot C SCN which is fine
12:43 - for us dot T SC n is the extension that
12:47 - all the Godot scenes are going to be
12:50 - putting at the end you can use other
12:52 - ones but definitely stick with that one
12:54 - we'll get more into that later and just
12:58 - click Save so now this is saved it has a
13:01 - name sprite scene and we can try it out
13:04 - this button right here it looks like a
13:08 - movie clapper with a play icon on it if
13:11 - I hover just play the edited scene so
13:15 - that's just going to play the scene
13:16 - that we have open right now if I click
13:18 - it this is what pops up so there is our
13:26 - test game with our sprites in the center
13:28 - of the screen ok thanks for watching I
13:32 - hope you're as excited to learn about
13:34 - Godot as I am to be teaching you I'm
13:36 - going to be making a bunch of good old
13:37 - videos coming up so please like and
13:40 - subscribe so you can see them as soon as
13:42 - they're released if you have a few
13:44 - dollars to spare please consider my
13:45 - patreon page it really does help keep
13:47 - the videos coming see you next time
