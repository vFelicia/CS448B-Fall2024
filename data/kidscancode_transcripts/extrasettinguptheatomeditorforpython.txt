00:11 - hi everyone this is a quick video about
00:13 - text editors and which ones work well
00:16 - with Python and PI games specifically so
00:20 - we've been using idle up till now if
00:23 - you've been going through the beginner
00:24 - series and idle is nice because it comes
00:27 - with Python and it's there when you
00:28 - install it but it's not very good for
00:32 - when you get a little bit more advanced
00:34 - so we're going to leave Python idle
00:37 - behind and we're going to use something
00:40 - called atom there's lots of different
00:43 - text editors out there and if you have a
00:45 - favorite one already that you'd rather
00:46 - use that's fine
00:47 - I like atom it works pretty well and
00:51 - it's available for whatever kind of
00:53 - computer you might have so the website
00:55 - is a DeMayo and you're just going to
00:58 - click the red download button and it'll
01:00 - download the right one for your type of
01:02 - computer ok when you finish downloading
01:05 - atom and you launch it for the first
01:07 - time it's going to look like this so
01:11 - it's almost ready to go but there's a
01:13 - couple of things we need to do in the
01:15 - settings just to get everything working
01:17 - perfectly for programming in Python so
01:21 - I'm going to go ahead and close these
01:22 - welcome screens and then I'm going to
01:25 - choose preferences if you're on Windows
01:28 - the Preferences is under the file menu
01:30 - but the Mac it's under atom we open
01:33 - preferences now there's lots of options
01:35 - and most of them we don't have to mess
01:37 - with but I'm going to scroll down to
01:40 - show indent guide ok that's going to be
01:45 - really helpful when you're making sure
01:47 - you indent things properly in python and
01:49 - you want to make sure soft tabs is
01:51 - checked it should be and we want to set
01:54 - our tab length to 4 because that's the
01:56 - correct amount for python all right a
02:01 - couple other things if we click over
02:02 - here on packages wait a second there's
02:07 - lots of packages that are already
02:08 - installed basically for different
02:11 - functions different programming
02:12 - languages you might be using the
02:14 - specific one we want to turn on is
02:17 - autosave and if we click on settings we
02:21 - can we're going to click enabled right
02:23 - here that way our programs will get
02:26 - automatically saved
02:27 - three time we click away or close it you
02:30 - can't forget to save it okay and one
02:33 - more thing to do and we need to click on
02:35 - install and here we're going to install
02:41 - a package to help us run our Python
02:45 - programs so if you type in Adam runner
02:52 - search then it's going to go and find it
02:55 - there it is Adam Runner so just click
02:58 - install alright we click on packages
03:04 - Adam runners installed now if you're on
03:07 - Windows you are finished if you're on
03:09 - the Mac there's one more thing we need
03:11 - to do if you follow the directions for
03:14 - installing Python and PI game and the
03:17 - link is below if you haven't done that
03:18 - yet you're going to need to do one more
03:21 - thing so if we go up here to open your
03:25 - config we're going to have to add a
03:28 - little something here looks like this we
03:32 - have to say for Adam are sorry for
03:34 - runner ok for runner we need to do
03:42 - Python and we need to tell it to use
03:46 - user local bin Python 3 if you don't do
03:52 - this it'll try to use the default
03:54 - version of Python which is an old one
03:56 - that comes with OS 10 and will not work
03:59 - with PI game so if you do that make sure
04:04 - we save it and you should be good to go
04:08 - now that step was for Mac only now let's
04:13 - just make sure it works we can type in a
04:15 - quick little program make my font size a
04:19 - little bigger here we'll just print out
04:25 - a couple of quick random numbers okay
04:33 - save that need to make sure to put py at
04:37 - the end py tells the computer and Adam
04:40 - that this is a Python file and you'll
04:42 - know that it knows it's a Python file
04:45 - when it highlights everything in color
04:47 - properly okay now to run it you're just
04:51 - going to type ctrl R or on the windows
04:54 - you're going to type alt are either way
04:57 - you'll see the program run it runs over
04:59 - here if I if I type ctrl R again every
05:04 - time I type it it runs all right and we
05:09 - are done if you want to you can go and
05:13 - play around over in the settings with
05:17 - the themes there's all sorts of
05:20 - different colors you can use different
05:26 - styles you can play around with that if
05:28 - you like I tend to like the tomorrow and
05:33 - the one dark is what I'm going to be
05:35 - using but you can use whatever you want
05:36 - alright and we're ready to go start
05:39 - learning to use PI game so I'll see you
05:41 - in that video series
