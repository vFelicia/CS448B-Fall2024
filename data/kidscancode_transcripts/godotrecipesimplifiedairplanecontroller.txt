00:05 - in this recipe we're making what i'm
00:07 - calling a
00:07 - simplified airplane controller and by
00:10 - simplified what i mean is we're not
00:12 - simulating
00:12 - aerodynamics we're not calculating lift
00:15 - drag
00:16 - and so on and in fact we're not using
00:18 - physics at all
00:19 - what we're going for is the feel of
00:22 - flying a plane
00:24 - where you can just kind of jump in and
00:26 - start flying
00:27 - and there's not a complicated control
00:29 - scheme i'm just using a single
00:31 - stick to control the plane
00:34 - and this will be suitable for all kinds
00:36 - of flying type games where you don't
00:39 - need
00:40 - full-on realistic flight physics right
00:43 - so let's look at how
00:45 - we can make this since we're not using
00:48 - any physics we're going to stick with a
00:49 - kinematic body
00:50 - for our plane and then i've imported a
00:53 - mesh
00:54 - of this little cartoon plane which came
00:56 - with an animation for the propeller so
00:58 - that's why we have an animation player
00:59 - here
01:00 - that was part of the gltf that we
01:03 - imported
01:04 - and then i have had have a collision
01:06 - shape here and the collision shape i'm
01:07 - just using a cylinder
01:09 - just to match the fuselage of the
01:12 - airplane and that's just so that i can
01:15 - do
01:17 - landing so that the at the end we can
01:19 - you know land on the ground and we can
01:20 - see
01:21 - since this plane doesn't have landing
01:23 - gear or anything we're going to slide on
01:24 - the belly
01:25 - along the ground to count as
01:28 - having landed and that's really all we
01:32 - need
01:32 - node-wise all right let's look at our
01:34 - script and first
01:36 - we're going to add a bunch of variables
01:38 - that'll allow us to configure
01:40 - the behavior we're going to have a
01:43 - minimum and maximum flight speed
01:46 - right you can't fly below this speed
01:48 - that's the minimum
01:49 - and this will be our maximum our turn
01:52 - speed is going to be how quickly
01:54 - when we turn the stick left and right
01:57 - is the plane going to turn and pitch
01:59 - speed is how quickly we're going to
02:00 - climb
02:01 - or dive when we move the stick forward
02:04 - or back
02:07 - uh level speed is how quickly the wings
02:09 - are going to return to level when you
02:12 - let the stick go back to the center um
02:15 - throttle delta when we press throttle up
02:17 - and throttle down that's how much
02:18 - the throttle is going to change when we
02:21 - press it
02:22 - and then acceleration is how quickly the
02:23 - plane is going to accelerate um
02:25 - or decelerate to a given speed when you
02:28 - change the throttle
02:30 - and so we have our forward speed that's
02:31 - how fast we're going to be flying that's
02:33 - our air speed
02:34 - and then target speed is going to be
02:35 - what's set by the throttle right when
02:37 - you
02:38 - push the throttle up we're going to
02:40 - increase the target speed
02:41 - and the plane will accelerate up to the
02:45 - forward speed right being capped at
02:48 - the maximum and the same thing when we
02:50 - press throttle down our target speed
02:52 - will be lower
02:53 - the speed will decrease okay here's our
02:56 - velocity
02:57 - that's the plane's forward direction
03:00 - that it's moving in
03:02 - and then these two variables are to
03:04 - capture the input from the
03:06 - from the stick i'm using an analog
03:09 - controller
03:10 - on this demo you could also put
03:13 - inputs for keys if you wanted let's look
03:16 - at those inputs now actually
03:19 - so here we have throttle up and throttle
03:22 - down i'm using the a and b buttons for
03:24 - that
03:24 - pitch up pitch down left and right are
03:27 - all going to be the left
03:29 - analog stick and the four different
03:30 - directions that we move them in
03:32 - and again if you want to use different
03:34 - controls you can add in
03:37 - keyboard or gamepad or whatever else you
03:40 - have
03:42 - all right let's look at our code for
03:43 - getting the input so we have our
03:46 - throttle up and throttle down which are
03:48 - going to increase
03:50 - the target speed or decrease the target
03:52 - speed and i'm using min
03:54 - or max to clamp it to the minimum
03:58 - or maximum flight speed so we can't go
03:59 - above or below those values
04:03 - and then our turn input and pitch input
04:05 - are just going to be getting the action
04:06 - strength
04:07 - of that analog stick input
04:10 - okay now we can look at movement which
04:12 - we're going to do in physics process
04:14 - and so we're going to call our git input
04:17 - function that we made and we're going to
04:19 - take our forward speed
04:21 - and we're going to interpolate it based
04:23 - on our target speed
04:25 - so that we will accelerate or decelerate
04:28 - to whatever our new target speed is
04:32 - um our velocity is just going to be our
04:34 - forward
04:35 - direction times that forward speed right
04:37 - the airplane always moves
04:39 - forward and then we're going to use move
04:41 - and slide to actually
04:42 - move it and so if we were to try running
04:45 - it now i've added
04:46 - the plane to a test scene here
04:50 - just with some a ground and some
04:53 - obstacles that we can see
04:55 - and if we try running it now what we'll
04:57 - see is that if we press our
04:59 - throttle up button we will begin moving
05:02 - forward
05:03 - faster and faster until we get to our
05:06 - maximum speed
05:07 - and then decelerate if we press
05:10 - throttle down okay so now we can start
05:13 - doing some of the
05:14 - turning and pitching let's talk let's do
05:17 - pitch first
05:18 - so after we get our input
05:22 - we're going to rotate
05:25 - around the x-axis based on our pitch
05:29 - input and since the x-axis is side to
05:31 - side so that's going to pitch us up
05:33 - or down and then of course we will move
05:37 - in that direction so if we try it now we
05:40 - should be able to test out
05:42 - pitching up and down
05:50 - climbing diving
05:54 - good and then we can even do a loop if
05:56 - we want
06:09 - now for turning we're going to do
06:11 - something very similar we're going to
06:12 - rotate
06:14 - around the up vector based on our turn
06:17 - input
06:18 - and what that's going to look like when
06:20 - we try running this
06:25 - is that we can now climb and we can turn
06:29 - and so the turning however you notice is
06:33 - very flat
06:35 - right and while i'm able to turn and
06:37 - steer this isn't really how airplanes
06:39 - turn right they bank
06:41 - when they turn so what we're going to
06:43 - want to do
06:44 - is when we're turning add some roll
06:48 - to the plane and
06:51 - we're going to do this by rotating the
06:53 - mesh
06:54 - so we're rotating the mesh based on the
06:57 - turn
06:58 - input so this harder we turn
07:01 - the steeper the bank will be
07:04 - and now if we try this out it's going to
07:06 - look a lot better
07:08 - and feel a lot more
07:12 - like flying an airplane
07:15 - let's see if i do a shallow bank the
07:19 - wings tilt further or tilt less so do a
07:22 - hard bank it tilts farther
07:24 - when i let go of the stick the wings
07:27 - level out
07:29 - because of course the bank isn't
07:30 - actually what's
07:32 - causing our turn but it looks like it
07:34 - and that's what counts
07:35 - and really that's it that is our
07:38 - airplane controller
07:39 - so in just a few lines of code five or
07:42 - six lines in the
07:44 - in the physics process for our movement
07:46 - we've got a really
07:47 - fun to fly around little airplane and
07:51 - you could adapt this to all sorts of
07:54 - flying based games right one major thing
07:58 - that's missing though
07:59 - is our interaction with the ground
08:02 - landing and taking off because now
08:03 - right now if i go down and i hit the
08:05 - ground right we're just gonna slide
08:07 - along it
08:08 - because of move and slide and that's
08:10 - really not
08:12 - what we want so let's talk about how we
08:13 - could handle landing and taking off
08:18 - all right so we're going to do this
08:19 - again in a simplified manner
08:21 - so then it just gives us the basics of
08:23 - what we need
08:24 - and so we're going to add a variable
08:26 - called grounded to keep track of our
08:27 - state whether we're
08:28 - we've landed or are in the air and
08:32 - in our physics process there's a few
08:33 - things here first of all the rotation of
08:35 - the body
08:36 - right i don't want my wings digging into
08:38 - the ground when i'm taxiing
08:41 - on the on the on the ground so if we're
08:44 - grounded
08:47 - then we are not going to rotate this
08:48 - we're just going to make sure to set
08:50 - this rotation
08:52 - equal to zero
08:57 - and then if we're that way if we're not
08:58 - grounded if we're in the air then
09:00 - we can do the rotation okay
09:04 - and now before we do move move-in slide
09:08 - okay we are going to want to check if
09:10 - we're on the floor
09:12 - so this is this is to handle if we're on
09:13 - the ground or not so if we're
09:15 - if is on floor
09:18 - then we're going to check if we're
09:20 - grounded or not already
09:23 - if we're not grounded then we must have
09:27 - just landed
09:28 - so let's set our rotation dot x equal to
09:31 - zero so that our plane will be
09:33 - flat on the ground and not nose in or
09:36 - nose up
09:38 - and then we're also going to set
09:41 - grounded equal true
09:45 - and then since we're on the ground we'll
09:47 - be moving along the ground
09:49 - we're going to add a little velocity
09:52 - in the y direction to sort of stick us
09:55 - to the ground
09:56 - we could do this with move and slide and
09:57 - snap move and slide with snap
10:00 - as well but since we're already doing
10:02 - this i'm just going to leave it
10:03 - this way the result will be the same
10:05 - okay if we're not on the
10:07 - on the floor then grounded equals
10:11 - false okay so now we have our grounded
10:15 - state okay and then there's a couple of
10:18 - things we want to change
10:20 - in the input as well here because
10:24 - when we are turning or pitching we're
10:26 - going to want to change
10:27 - these a little bit too okay so the turn
10:30 - input we're going to say
10:34 - let's set turn
10:38 - input equal to 0
10:42 - and let's say if
10:47 - forward speed is greater than a really
10:50 - small number
10:51 - then we'll be allowed to turn that way
10:53 - if we land and come to a complete stop
10:56 - we're going to we're going to not be
10:58 - able to turn
11:00 - okay throttle down we also want to be
11:02 - able to go below the flight speed if we
11:04 - are
11:05 - on the ground so let's set our limit of
11:09 - what our
11:12 - minimum speed can be to zero if we're
11:15 - grounded
11:17 - else it's min flight speed and then
11:20 - we'll use that
11:22 - in this
11:26 - limit function so now we can throttle
11:29 - down to zero
11:30 - if we're grounded on if we're on the
11:31 - ground
11:33 - and then lastly with our pitch input
11:37 - oops with our pitch input we're going to
11:38 - want to change this around a little bit
11:40 - so here's what i'm going to do i'm going
11:42 - to say pitch input equals zero
11:44 - and then if we're not
11:48 - grounded meaning when we're in the air
11:52 - then we can pitch down
11:56 - so
11:59 - okay so we're going to subtract input
12:02 - pitch down
12:03 - if we're in the air so when we're on the
12:05 - ground we won't build a nose down into
12:06 - the ground
12:07 - that's just going to make it so that
12:09 - we're nice
12:10 - nicely driving around when we're taxiing
12:13 - okay
12:14 - and then here to pitch up
12:17 - if only if forward speed
12:20 - is greater than equal to min flight
12:22 - speed
12:24 - all right so when we're on the ground
12:25 - and taxiing really slow we can't take
12:27 - off yet
12:29 - okay and that's going to do it that's
12:31 - going to do our be
12:32 - our changes for being on the ground so
12:35 - let's try that
12:36 - out okay so here we are on the ground
12:40 - and if i start accelerating forward you
12:41 - see we're moving slowly
12:43 - and i can turn and i can taxi but i
12:45 - can't take off yet if i pull back on the
12:47 - stick nothing happens
12:48 - but if i keep the stick pulled back and
12:50 - i keep accelerating as soon as i reach
12:52 - that min flight speed
12:54 - now i'm up in the air and i can fly
12:56 - around
12:57 - as normal like we did before now if i
12:59 - throttle down
13:00 - i'm now going that min flight speed so
13:03 - if i get down here on the ground we're
13:06 - going to
13:06 - change to the grounded state when we
13:08 - land on the ground
13:10 - and now i'm in the grounded state right
13:12 - i'm not banking anymore i'm taxiing
13:15 - and if i throttle down i can go
13:18 - all the way down to zero so that gives
13:20 - us a way to land
13:21 - and take off that remains as remains
13:24 - simplified to go with the rest of our
13:26 - code
13:27 - all right i hope you enjoyed this one i
13:29 - enjoyed making this one and it's a lot
13:30 - of fun to fly around
13:32 - makes me want to make some uh little
13:34 - dogfight type of game or something like
13:36 - that
13:37 - um with this right add some shooting to
13:40 - the plane so on
13:42 - if you have some ideas post them in the
13:44 - in the comments below but hopefully this
13:46 - will inspire you to do some things with
13:48 - flying as well thanks for watching and
