00:02 - welcome to part 4 of the top-down tank
00:04 - battle tutorial this time we're going to
00:07 - talk about bullets we have a player and
00:09 - an enemy tank that can both move and aim
00:12 - and now we need them to fire so let's
00:14 - get started so we're going to start with
00:17 - the physics layers if you go into the
00:19 - project settings under 2d physics layer
00:23 - names you can give names to the
00:25 - different physics layers that you can
00:27 - put objects in and so so far I've
00:31 - decided I think we need for environment
00:34 - is gonna be for the obstacles trees
00:38 - rocks whatever whatever obstacles are in
00:40 - the environment the player - or the
00:44 - player is gonna be on the layer -
00:44 - enemies on layer 3 and bullets on layer
00:47 - 4 and what that'll do is let us do
00:50 - things like make the players bullet not
00:53 - hit itself or make the enemy bullets not
00:57 - hit each other that kind of thing so
01:00 - I've set those up and I've also just
01:03 - quickly added another path for the
01:06 - second enemy here and what I thought
01:09 - would be fun maybe it goes around it
01:13 - goes off the screen briefly so you can
01:14 - see it goes over here comes off the
01:16 - screen and comes back on so it'll sort
01:19 - of just cycle around in a little figure
01:21 - 8 kind of path so we're gonna make a so
01:24 - we're gonna take our existing stuff and
01:28 - the player I put it on the player layer
01:33 - and I said it's mask to environment and
01:38 - enemies so that when it's driving around
01:40 - these are what it collides with and then
01:43 - on the enemy tank I did the same thing
01:46 - except that I put it in the enemy's lair
01:48 - and I said it's
01:52 - collisions to environment and player and
01:55 - I'm still deciding whether I want to put
01:57 - enemies here or not so you know I could
02:00 - have two tanks with overlapping paths
02:04 - and if I leave this unchecked they're
02:06 - not going to see each other so they'll
02:08 - just sort of drive right through each
02:10 - other or if I do this then they would
02:12 - collide
02:13 - so I'd have to be more careful about how
02:15 - I set up the enemy's paths so I'm not
02:18 - entirely sure yet which way would be
02:21 - better for that so I'm going to leave
02:22 - that off for now and then the other one
02:24 - is the detect radius I'm gonna set the
02:27 - detect radius to only see the player
02:30 - layer and what that actually allows us
02:32 - to do is here since it can only detect
02:38 - the player we can actually trim the code
02:41 - a little bit because the only thing it's
02:43 - gonna be able to see are those things
02:46 - are things in that layer and the player
02:48 - is the only one we're putting in that
02:49 - layer right now later if there are more
02:52 - than one human controlled tank then they
02:56 - can both be in that layer and the enemy
02:58 - tank would see either one okay and then
03:01 - I've started making a bullet scene here
03:04 - and this is going to be the master
03:06 - bullet scene that the others will
03:08 - inherit from so it's gonna have the
03:09 - generic bullet related things about it
03:12 - and I'm gonna use an area 2d for its
03:15 - root node I like using area two DS for
03:17 - projectiles because they don't need to
03:22 - collide with things we just need to
03:24 - detect contact so as soon as it overlaps
03:27 - something it's gonna explode and do
03:30 - damage and whatever it needs to do so I
03:32 - like using area 2d for that keeps it
03:35 - nice and simple and the sprite is
03:39 - attached for its appearance and it'll
03:41 - have a collision shape and it's gonna
03:43 - have a lifetime timer that's going to
03:46 - that we can set to determine how long we
03:49 - want that bullet to last and so it'll
03:53 - you know the fire and travel a certain
03:55 - amount of distance and then explode and
03:57 - so I'm saving that in a folder called
04:00 - bullets and called it bullet dot scene
04:02 - and that will be the one we inherit for
04:06 - our individual player bullet or multiple
04:10 - types of player bullet maybe we want to
04:12 - have different kinds of weapon upgrades
04:14 - enemy bullets etc alright so let's
04:18 - attach a script to this bullet and this
04:20 - will be the default script that all the
04:22 - bullets will inherit from as well so
04:25 - what do we need we need
04:27 - need a speed variable I'm going to
04:30 - different speed bullets we need and
04:35 - damage how much damage is a bullet do
04:39 - when it hits and I'm also going to do a
04:44 - lifetime that we can set our lifetime or
04:49 - two we're going to have a velocity needs
04:55 - to move and so let's see so in the ready
05:01 - actually we won't do that in the ready
05:04 - so when the bullet spawns we need to
05:05 - make sure it gets placed at the right
05:08 - location which is the the muzzle
05:10 - position to D that we've put at the end
05:13 - of the each tanks muzzle and it also
05:16 - needs to be pointed in the right
05:18 - direction so the the note needs to be
05:21 - rotated so it's facing in the right
05:22 - direction and then the velocity needs to
05:24 - travel in that direction
05:26 - so whenever the bullet is spawned we
05:29 - need to pass all that information in to
05:33 - it so we're going to make a start
05:38 - function here that's going to initialize
05:41 - it and we're going to pass it a position
05:42 - and a direction and those will be those
05:47 - will both be vector those will both be
05:49 - vectors position will be it's the global
05:51 - position for it to start at and
05:52 - direction will be a direction vector for
05:54 - what direction should be pointing in so
05:57 - we set our bullets position to that
06:00 - position that we passed in we set its
06:03 - rotation to the to the direction we
06:06 - passed in its angle and then we set our
06:10 - lifetime wait time equal to whatever its
06:15 - lifetime is set to and then we set our
06:18 - velocity equal to that direction vector
06:26 - times speed
06:29 - and then that way it will travel in
06:31 - whatever direction we want to go at
06:32 - whatever speed we will have to go and
06:34 - then in our process function we're just
06:37 - going to update the position we just add
06:42 - velocity times Delta and now the other
06:48 - thing that this is going to need is we
06:50 - have a couple of signals to connect
06:51 - right because we want when the a body
06:55 - enters we want to connect that signal
06:57 - and then when the lifetime times out we
07:02 - want to connect that signal and so what
07:06 - do we want these things to do well when
07:07 - the lifetime times out we want it to we
07:11 - want to delete the bullet but we also
07:13 - probably want it to explode and do
07:14 - whatever now I'm not going to be doing
07:16 - the explosion animation yet and
07:19 - everything so I'm just gonna make a
07:20 - explode function that's just going to do
07:25 - Q free for now and then later we'll come
07:29 - back and add the animation and I just
07:30 - want to get this working so when the
07:32 - timer times out that's when we want to
07:35 - explode and when the bullet detects a
07:42 - body entered then we want to make sure
07:45 - it might hit a it might hit a wall it
07:51 - might hit an enemy tank if it's a wall
07:54 - it should just explode if it's an enemy
07:57 - tank it should explode and also deal
08:00 - damage so we need to explode but we also
08:04 - need to check if the body that it hit
08:07 - has a take damage method so if the if
08:14 - the body that it hit is capable of
08:16 - taking damage then we will call that
08:20 - method and pass in the damage amount so
08:26 - now we can do damage to whatever things
08:28 - the bullet hits okay and so that's going
08:32 - to be our generic bullet code that's
08:34 - going to apply to all the different
08:36 - kinds of bullets we can fire and now we
08:39 - need to make a specific one for the play
08:44 - all right so I made a new inherited
08:46 - scene called player bullet and I've
08:49 - added this green shell sprite now one
08:52 - thing to point out is if you look at the
08:56 - sprite sheet the bullets happen to be
09:00 - drawn now they facing to the left so
09:03 - they're gonna be rotated 180 degrees so
09:05 - I just took the sprite node and I
09:07 - rotated it 180 so that my bullet will be
09:11 - pointing in the zero direction I added a
09:16 - rectangular collision shape you could
09:18 - probably do I mean you could do a
09:20 - capsule year-2 doesn't really matter the
09:22 - overlap the bullets would be moving
09:24 - relatively fast so they're gonna look
09:27 - like they hit no matter what kind of
09:28 - collision shape you have here as long as
09:30 - it doesn't stick out too far from the
09:32 - shape and so we need to add so I've
09:35 - disconnected the script so that I can
09:39 - add a new one that inherits from that
09:45 - inherits from the bullet script and this
09:49 - is where I could add whatever specific
09:51 - code I need for the player bullet but I
09:53 - don't think I have any specific code to
09:55 - add to the player bullet yet so I'm just
09:56 - gonna leave that as is until we come
09:59 - back to do the next step so now we need
10:03 - this player to spawn these things and so
10:08 - this is a problem that a lot of
10:09 - beginners run into is when they're
10:11 - making some object that fires
10:14 - projectiles is well this this this code
10:19 - is where we have the control code right
10:20 - so you're controlling the player you're
10:22 - gonna click fire and you're gonna want
10:25 - the player tank to spawn a bullet right
10:27 - here and go well that bullet if you add
10:31 - that bullet as a child of the tank then
10:35 - that bullet is gonna rotate when the
10:37 - tank rotates and it move when the tank
10:39 - moves so if you fire a bullet in you
10:42 - know it to the right and then you turn
10:43 - your tank that bullet is gonna swing
10:45 - around to always be in front of the tank
10:49 - and that's not what you want right you
10:50 - want to fire and forget but shell just
10:52 - flies out by itself and it's no longer
10:54 - attached to or
10:56 - responsibilities of the player another
11:00 - thing is that if our another reason that
11:03 - that doesn't work well is if the enemy
11:05 - tank fires a bunch of bullets and then
11:08 - you destroy the enemy tank those bullets
11:10 - would then instantly disappear as well
11:12 - because they're children of the enemy
11:14 - tank rather than continuing to travel on
11:17 - by themselves so you want the bullets to
11:18 - be independent of the things that fire
11:20 - them one way to think about it is that
11:23 - be the tank itself has no idea what or
11:27 - control over what happens to a bullet
11:29 - after it shoots it right it just hands
11:31 - it off and says there it goes I'm no
11:33 - longer controlling this so you need to
11:35 - hand it to another scene and that's
11:37 - probably what our main scene is a good
11:41 - candidate for so if we pass the so if we
11:49 - pass the bullet to the main scene then
11:52 - the main scene can instantiate it add it
11:55 - as a child do any management of it that
11:58 - needs to happen and our tanks that fire
12:03 - them don't have to know anything about
12:04 - that
12:04 - so we're going to go to our player
12:08 - script first and we already created a
12:12 - bullet export variable so we're just
12:16 - going to drag the player bullet and drop
12:18 - it in there so it knows which one it's
12:21 - gonna use and then make sure you have
12:24 - your gun cooldown set and then we can go
12:27 - to the player script actually I misspoke
12:30 - we're gonna start with the tank script
12:32 - because the enemy tanks need to fire two
12:34 - so both of them have this can shoot
12:38 - variable they have a gun timer that
12:41 - counts down with the cooldown of their
12:43 - gun so that is already good for both
12:47 - types of tank so what we need to add is
12:49 - the actual shoot function all right so
12:53 - I'm going to add a shoot function here
12:55 - and what this function is going to do is
13:01 - and so what this functions going to do
13:03 - is spawn a bullet if can't shoot is true
13:07 - and if it is then we're gonna set can
13:09 - shoot to false and start the cooldown
13:15 - timer so gun timer start remember when
13:19 - the gun timer ends can't shoot goes back
13:22 - to true so another bullet is allowed and
13:25 - then we need to get those two pieces of
13:27 - information that we send to the bullet
13:30 - it's the position in the direction and
13:33 - that lines going to get kind of long so
13:35 - I'm going to use a temporary variable
13:36 - here for the direction the direction is
13:38 - a unit vector so I need a unit vector
13:40 - and I need to rotate it so that it's
13:43 - pointing in the direction of the turret
13:45 - so I'm going to use turret global
13:48 - rotation and then I can create the
13:53 - bullet but again we don't want to spawn
13:54 - the bullet here and make it a child of
13:55 - the player or of the tank that's that's
13:58 - shooting it we want to pass it to the
14:00 - main scene so we're going to do that
14:02 - with a signal so we have a signal here
14:04 - called shoot and I'm going to omit that
14:08 - signal and omit the shoot signal and
14:12 - then along with it I'm going to pass the
14:14 - bullet and the two pieces of information
14:16 - the bullet needs which is the position
14:18 - which we're gonna use the muzzles global
14:21 - position and that direction we just
14:23 - calculated so now our tank can any of
14:27 - the tanks can shoot and they emit that
14:29 - bullet and then they're done they're
14:32 - happy they've emitted the bullet the
14:34 - fact that nothing is available to handle
14:36 - that or listening to that right now and
14:38 - actually manages the bullet doesn't
14:40 - matter to the tank so if we go over to
14:44 - our player script all we've got to add
14:47 - is the input action for click which is
14:51 - the left mouse button to call its shoot
14:53 - function and now our player enemy our
14:55 - star player tank would be shooting
14:57 - whenever we click the mouse button it's
14:58 - just that we wouldn't see those bullets
15:00 - because nothing is handling them when
15:02 - they're emitted and we're gonna do that
15:03 - in the map script here's our map script
15:06 - and this is where we're going to need a
15:08 - function to receive those bullets that
15:11 - are being spawned and the main scene
15:15 - doesn't care whether it was a player
15:16 - bullet or an enemy bullet it's just a
15:19 - bullet it just needs to knows it needs
15:20 - to
15:20 - Spahn some bullet and add it add it to
15:22 - the scene so we're just gonna say on
15:26 - tank shoot here and it has three
15:33 - parameters coming with it so we're gonna
15:35 - grab those and use those to spawn the
15:40 - bullet so we're not going to make a new
15:42 - bullet instance lowercase is a variable
15:46 - we're gonna make a bullet instance we're
15:48 - going to add it as a child and then
15:53 - we're going to call its start function
15:56 - with the position and direction that we
16:00 - just passed in and now this method just
16:04 - needs to be connected to any tanks shoot
16:08 - signal so if we go to the player we can
16:11 - connect its shoot meth
16:12 - I'm sorry shoot signal to on tank shoot
16:19 - and then there we go all connected so
16:24 - let's give it a try and see if it works
16:28 - oops I forgot to set the time on the
16:31 - bullet I need to give it a speed the
16:34 - player bullet needs to have a speed say
16:37 - 750 a damage say 10 doesn't matter in
16:40 - right now in a lifetime I'm gonna say
16:42 - 0.5 all right
16:45 - back to our map then run that again and
16:49 - there we go so now we have a bullet
16:52 - coming out you can see it disappears
16:56 - after half a second but if it hits the
16:58 - enemy tank it also hits so our
17:01 - collisions are working our cooldown is
17:05 - working and that's a good start
17:09 - so in the next step we're going to do
17:12 - the same thing with the enemy tank we
17:15 - need the enemy tank to also spawn its
17:19 - bullets and it'll do it whenever the
17:21 - player was is within range and the
17:24 - cooldown is has expired
17:31 - thanks for watching and I'll see you in
17:32 - the next step
17:40 - you
