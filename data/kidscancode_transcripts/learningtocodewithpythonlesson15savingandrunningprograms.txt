00:01 - welcome back to learning to code with
00:03 - python this time we'll have a brief
00:05 - lesson on how to save your work and run
00:08 - programs that you've already
00:11 - written so up till now we've been typing
00:14 - all our commands one at a time into the
00:16 - python shell that works well enough for
00:18 - simple things and for trying out new
00:19 - commands but you might want to try
00:21 - something more complicated and you
00:23 - definitely want to be able to save your
00:24 - work if you've made a program that's
00:26 - more than a few commands
00:28 - long here's how we do that first choose
00:32 - file new file from the
00:34 - menu now you have a blank window that
00:37 - looks like
00:39 - this this is just a normal editing
00:41 - window if you've used any text editor
00:44 - before it works the same way you can
00:46 - type copy and paste and so
00:49 - on now let's create a
00:52 - program first I'm going to add the
00:53 - commands to create a turtle
00:58 - window
01:01 - notice that nothing's happened yet
01:02 - that's because we're just typing our
01:04 - program everything that we want it to do
01:06 - and when we're ready we'll run the
01:07 - program all at
01:28 - once
01:35 - okay here's our simple program the
01:37 - computer is going to read this program
01:38 - just like you would one line at a time
01:40 - starting at the top and ending when
01:42 - there were no more lines left with
01:44 - practice you'll be able to look at a
01:45 - program like this and have a really good
01:47 - idea of what's going to happen when the
01:48 - computer runs
01:51 - it okay now the program is saved and
01:53 - we're ready to run
01:56 - it in the menu choose run run mod module
02:00 - you can also press F5 on your
02:04 - keyboard now the program will run and
02:06 - the computer will follow all the steps
02:09 - that we've
02:13 - written now let's say we want to make a
02:18 - change instead of blue I want the color
02:21 - to be
02:23 - red and then maybe I want it to change
02:27 - color to Green before it draws the
02:30 - second
02:32 - Circle you can make as many changes as
02:35 - you like and then when you're ready you
02:38 - can go ahead and run it
02:41 - again notice that it asks me to save
02:43 - since I haven't saved it this is really
02:46 - nice if you ever forget to save your
02:47 - program the computer will remind you
02:49 - when you try to run
02:50 - it so now when we run our program it
02:53 - starts over at the beginning and follows
02:56 - the instructions I've given
02:58 - it
03:02 - at this point you can add more commands
03:05 - if you want build up more and more steps
03:08 - this is how you'll work in future
03:09 - lessons we'll write some code try it out
03:12 - then add some more to it try it out
03:14 - again it's always easier to do a little
03:16 - bit at a time than to try to do
03:17 - everything at
03:21 - once okay practice writing a few
03:24 - programs and saving them and in the next
03:26 - lesson we'll start to learn some new
03:28 - commands
03:38 - I
