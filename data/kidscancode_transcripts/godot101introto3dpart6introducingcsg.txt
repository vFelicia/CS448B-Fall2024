00:00 - earlier we saw how to design a 3d
00:01 - environment using imported models but
00:04 - what if we want to make something like a
00:05 - room that has walls doors ramps and
00:08 - other things but we don't want to have
00:10 - any models handy
00:11 - that's where CSG comes to the rescue CSG
00:14 - stands for constructive solid geometry
00:17 - it allows you to build complex geometry
00:20 - using primitive shapes combining them in
00:22 - different ways so let's look at CSG and
00:25 - how it works and then we'll use it to
00:27 - make a new environment for a character
00:29 - to move around in start with a spacial
00:32 - scene and then add a child and type CSG
00:35 - in the search box and you'll see a list
00:39 - of the different CSG nodes we have to
00:40 - choose from these different shapes can
00:44 - then be combined into other ones let's
00:47 - start with a box so here we have a CSG
00:50 - box and you'll see in the properties
00:52 - over here we can set the size but we can
00:56 - also set the operation Union
00:59 - intersection or subtraction and that's
01:01 - going to be how different shapes are
01:03 - combined so let's give the CSG box a
01:06 - child of a cylinder and now we see we
01:12 - have a cylinder here and we can change
01:16 - the cylinder number of sides to make it
01:18 - more round we could stretch it taller to
01:22 - make it taller and because it's set on
01:25 - Union these two shapes are going to be
01:28 - combined into a single shape but let's
01:31 - try setting it instead to intersection
01:35 - so now we only get the part where the
01:38 - two shapes overlap turns snapping off
01:43 - here and you can see it a little cleaner
01:44 - so now we only get the two parts
01:46 - overlapping and then subtraction is the
01:50 - opposite the cube will have the cylinder
01:56 - subtracted from it so you can see we
01:59 - could Center in here we're cutting a
02:01 - hole right through the center of the
02:03 - cube we change the radius here so we're
02:08 - not quite so big right you could rotate
02:10 - it and you're cutting a hole through it
02:14 - like that so any CSG shape is going to
02:19 - have the children applied to it in order
02:23 - using whatever operation they have
02:25 - chosen so let's make something useful
02:28 - I'm going to delete the cylinder so that
02:31 - we're starting with a box and so this
02:35 - box is going to be our room the walls of
02:39 - the room let's make it big I'm gonna set
02:43 - the width to 20 and the depth to 20 so
02:47 - we have a large room and I'm gonna set
02:50 - the height to let's say five so that's
02:55 - our room but we want to be inside the
02:57 - room not outside it so I'm going to
02:59 - click invert faces and now the inside
03:03 - becomes the surface not the outside and
03:07 - the the camera will automatically hide
03:10 - the one you're looking at so you can see
03:12 - it
03:13 - let's turn snapping back on so
03:14 - everything's going to be and I like to
03:16 - move it up so that it's at the level of
03:20 - the grid so that I can see the grid on
03:23 - the floor so there's our room now if we
03:26 - stick our player in here it's gonna fall
03:28 - right through so we need to turn on use
03:30 - collision so let's name name this CSG
03:35 - room and we're gonna save it and let's
03:39 - add our character in here there's our
03:46 - character and recall that when we play
03:51 - the game you're going to be in capture
03:54 - mode mouse capture mode so we want to
03:57 - add a script to this and to this and add
04:03 - that code in from our last tutorial
04:12 - let's give it a try and now you see we
04:15 - can walk around inside the room and we
04:18 - are all good now let's add some features
04:22 - of this room as a start I'm going to add
04:25 - some internal walls so separated into
04:27 - two
04:27 - separate areas and I want to add a Ledge
04:29 - around part of it that will have a ramp
04:34 - that we can walk up to and so I'm going
04:37 - to make that in a separate scene and
04:38 - we're going to use the CSG combiner the
04:42 - CSG combiner node lets you organize your
04:47 - CSG nodes into groups so for example
04:50 - this is gonna be our ledge and so it
04:53 - will combine the objects underneath it
04:56 - but not with other ones in the scene so
04:59 - we're going to start with a couple of
05:01 - boxes okay and I've added two boxes a
05:05 - CSG box and a box as a child and I've
05:10 - made these both fairly thin and they're
05:14 - gonna go in the corner of one of the
05:16 - rooms but now I want to ramp so I can
05:18 - get up to it and to do that we're going
05:21 - to use the CSG polygon now the way up
05:28 - history polygon works is it takes a
05:31 - polygon and here you see it starts out
05:33 - being a square and then it extrudes it
05:37 - into a into a 3d shape and so for a ramp
05:41 - we want our polygon to have three sides
05:45 - so I'm going to reduce this to three and
05:47 - now you can grab these points and you
05:49 - can drag them around and turn that into
05:52 - your ramp and so here I've done this and
05:56 - if you want them to be perfectly lined
05:59 - up you might want to go over here and
06:00 - actually type in the numbers or you can
06:03 - drag the points whichever works better
06:05 - for you it's back over in our room we
06:07 - can instance our ledge object and place
06:12 - it so that it is aligned with the walls
06:15 - and we have a ramp that we can walk up
06:18 - let's try it out I can walk up the ramp
06:22 - and I'm on the ledge okay
06:27 - for my second feature of the wall I'm
06:29 - going to make a solid wall that has a
06:33 - height of five so it'll be the same
06:34 - height as the room itself floor to
06:38 - ceiling and then I'm gonna make it I
06:40 - want to make a doorway in it so we're
06:41 - gonna add a child CSG box and we're
06:45 - gonna set it to subtraction mode and
06:48 - that way we can place this so that it
06:55 - cuts a hole something like that and if
07:02 - we add that into our scene now we have a
07:04 - wall you could try doing some other
07:06 - things you could use a cylinder shape
07:08 - instead to give you an arched doorway if
07:12 - you don't cut the hole we can have a
07:13 - solid wall so we can make our room
07:16 - layout as complex as we want feel free
07:20 - to do it differently than me I'm going
07:23 - to show you a final layout here in the
07:25 - next scene so here's my final scene I've
07:28 - added on material to each of the objects
07:31 - just to give it a nice tan color I just
07:35 - changed the albedo color on each objects
07:41 - material and I've placed a couple of
07:44 - walls here's an example of a using a
07:47 - cylinder to cut out an arched doorway
07:51 - and then there's my ramp over there so I
07:54 - have some rooms that I can explore and I
07:59 - can walk through the doorways go into
08:02 - the other rooms and so on now the rooms
08:09 - pretty featureless right now as it is
08:11 - but you can spice it up a little just by
08:13 - putting a couple of lights in so here
08:16 - I've added a couple of lights to give it
08:17 - some visual appeal and I added a few of
08:20 - our crates that we made in the first
08:22 - video to have something to interact with
08:26 - so now if I go in here I've got a green
08:29 - light in this room and over here in this
08:33 - room we have a light there in the corner
08:35 - and we can go up on the ledge and
08:40 - knock over the crates so hopefully
08:43 - you're starting to see how powerful CSG
08:45 - nodes can be in building objects for
08:48 - your game they can be really useful for
08:50 - creating a quick prototype level to test
08:53 - out your character movement on or to
08:56 - make some complex shapes that you need
08:58 - for your game without having to go over
09:01 - into blender or something like that to
09:03 - model it just keep in mind that the more
09:07 - complex these trees of nodes get the
09:11 - more performance impact you're going to
09:12 - have so it's important to group them in
09:16 - these CSG combiners and don't try to
09:18 - combine too many objects all into one so
09:21 - you know rather than having each of
09:23 - these objects all be part of one tree we
09:26 - have them separated into different ones
09:28 - which is going to keep the performance
09:31 - impact as low as possible all right
09:34 - hopefully this was useful to you in the
09:36 - next video we're going to look at using
09:38 - this level to make a first-person
09:40 - perspective character instead of our
09:44 - third-person perspective character
09:45 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
09:48 - next time
09:55 - you
