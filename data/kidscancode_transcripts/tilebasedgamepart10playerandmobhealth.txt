00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:01 - pame this is part 10 of our tile based
00:04 - top down
00:05 - shooter and in this video we're going to
00:08 - be adding Health to our player and our
00:10 - mob
00:12 - Sprites all right so we have our gun
00:15 - working and we can shoot the zombies
00:17 - although hitting them in one shot is a
00:19 - little too
00:21 - powerful so what we want to do now is we
00:23 - want to add some health to those zombies
00:26 - and make the bullets uh do a certain
00:28 - amount of damage uh with hit so we're
00:31 - going to go over here to to our settings
00:34 - and we're going
00:37 - to add a bullet
00:42 - damage let's just keep round numbers I'm
00:46 - going to make the bullets do 10 points
00:48 - of damage and the mob zombies will have
00:51 - 100 Health okay so over here on
00:56 - our uh class
00:58 - mob
01:04 - they have a health of
01:05 - 100 and now what we can do is every time
01:09 - a bullet hits it we just want to
01:11 - subtract the bullet
01:13 - damage
01:15 - from the health and then if the health
01:18 - is ever less than zero we can put that
01:20 - in the update
01:24 - here self that health is less than
01:27 - zero put less than or equal to zero
01:32 - sorry
01:34 - then self.
01:37 - kill okay so now we just need to take
01:41 - away some health whenever the bullet
01:44 - hits okay so over here we in the last
01:48 - video added this little group Collide
01:50 - between the mobs and the bullets and we
01:52 - are just
01:53 - saying each mob that gets hit just gets
01:55 - killed so instead what we're going to do
01:58 - is we're going to say hit. Health minus
02:04 - equals bullet damage right we're just
02:06 - going to take away that amount and if it
02:08 - gets down to zero then the mob will uh
02:13 - will disappear because we already added
02:14 - that in the update um I'm also going to
02:17 - while I'm here I'm going to take the
02:18 - velocity of the mob and set it to zero
02:23 - so when you hit it it just will stop it
02:25 - slightly as if the bullet has a little
02:27 - bit of stopping power Okay so
02:30 - that should look like
02:33 - this okay I'll get over here so we have
02:36 - some more space you can
02:39 - see see I'm shooting that one and it
02:41 - disappears
02:44 - now good enough 10 shots to kill the
02:50 - Zombies but it would be nice if the
02:52 - zombies had some indication of what
02:55 - their health was right a little uh
02:57 - health bar that I could see going down
02:59 - so I know how much damage I'm doing and
03:01 - how close I am to killing the zombie
03:03 - because I might want to run away from it
03:05 - or I might want to keep shooting
03:07 - it okay so on our mob we're going to add
03:11 - a new method to our
03:14 - mob and this is going to be
03:18 - called Draw health and what this is
03:21 - going to do is draw a little colored bar
03:23 - up at the top you know superimposed on
03:26 - the mob showing what it's health bar is
03:31 - now one thing we want to do is let's go
03:34 - over here and check our colors do we
03:37 - have yep green yellow and red so it's
03:40 - green when it's full yellow when it's
03:42 - Midway and red when it starts to get low
03:44 - so we can see visually uh how it's
03:47 - changing so we're going to go over here
03:50 - and depending we need to choose a color
03:52 - based on what the health
03:54 - is if the health is greater than say
03:58 - 60%
04:00 - then the color is going to be
04:02 - green
04:05 - okay if it's not then we're going to say
04:08 - if it's greater than 30 the color is
04:10 - going to be
04:13 - yellow and otherwise the color will be
04:16 - red okay so now we know what color we're
04:20 - going to draw our bar in okay uh the
04:23 - width of the bar is just going to be
04:28 - um
04:30 - the width of the bar is going to be
04:33 - whatever the width of
04:35 - our rectangle
04:39 - is right times the percentage of the
04:42 - health that's left so self. health over
04:47 - 100 so if you have 50 Health left it'll
04:52 - be half the width right so that's
04:56 - perfect okay and then we need to make a
04:58 - little we need to figure out the
05:01 - rectangle that we're going to fill
05:06 - in so the health bar is going to be a
05:12 - rectangle and this this is the location
05:15 - it's going to be on
05:16 - the Sprite image not on the screen okay
05:21 - it's going to be width wide
05:23 - and uh let's try this thickness and see
05:28 - what we how we like it okay now I don't
05:30 - want to draw the
05:33 - bar I only want to draw the bar if it's
05:36 - actually less than 100 so when the mob
05:38 - first spawns and it's at full health we
05:40 - don't see the bar at all it'll be once
05:41 - we hit
05:43 - it so we're just going to draw that
05:45 - rectangle on top of our mob's
05:48 - image in the
05:51 - color and then we use that uh health bar
05:55 - rectangle
05:58 - okay
06:01 - all right so now what we can do is go
06:04 - back over here to our main and in the
06:07 - draw
06:08 - section right here we're going through
06:10 - all the Sprites and we're drawing them
06:11 - on the screen now only the zombies have
06:14 - a health bar so I only want to do the
06:17 - draw Health
06:18 - on Sprites that are zombies so we're
06:23 - going to use the is instance command to
06:25 - say if the Sprite we're looking at is an
06:28 - instance of of
06:30 - mob okay if it is a mob then it's going
06:32 - to have the draw
06:35 - health so we can say sprite. draw
06:40 - Health all right so let's try that
06:45 - out all right let's start shooting there
06:47 - we go see we have our nice little health
06:51 - bar uh going
06:55 - down turning red yellow and then red and
06:58 - then disappears very good now we have
07:01 - some nice feedback on
07:05 - our
07:07 - mobs and now we kind of want to do the
07:10 - same thing on our player which is we
07:14 - want to have the the mobs damage the
07:16 - player and we want to have the player
07:18 - have a health bar that we can see going
07:20 - down as well although I don't think we
07:22 - want to put the health bar of the player
07:23 - on the player uh we're going to put that
07:25 - up in the corner as a a heads up display
07:28 - um
07:29 - and uh we'll be able to see what our
07:31 - health is
07:33 - there so let's go to our player settings
07:36 - here and add a player health and we'll
07:38 - just have that start at 100
07:40 - too it's easy to use round numbers when
07:43 - you're starting and just occurs to me we
07:45 - forgot to do this we should have done
07:46 - this with the mob
07:48 - too uh set this as a variable so that
07:51 - it's easy for us to change later because
07:54 - we use that number 100 in a lot of
07:56 - different places right so here
08:00 - our mob's Health should be set
08:02 - to mob
08:04 - Health right and when we draw it um we
08:09 - care if it's less
08:11 - than whatever the full health is right
08:14 - and we want to draw the
08:19 - percentage right so that way we know
08:21 - what fraction we have of the of the
08:24 - health not have everything locked to
08:27 - 100 um okay so on the
08:30 - player we're also going to say our
08:32 - health of the player is player
08:36 - health and we just need to draw it on
08:40 - the screen we also need to take away
08:42 - some when when the mobs hit the player
08:45 - and so hitting the player uh we're going
08:49 - to go over to our update section again
08:52 - and we need to do a collision between
08:55 - the mobs and the
08:57 - player Okay so so that's going to
09:04 - be mob's hit player we're going to do
09:07 - another
09:10 - Collide we're going to do a Sprite
09:12 - Collide between the
09:13 - player
09:15 - mobs
09:18 - false now we probably want to
09:21 - use the hit rect hit hit rectangle again
09:24 - just like we did with the with the
09:26 - colliding with the walls remember we
09:28 - made the hit rect
09:30 - so we're going to say uh
09:32 - Collide hit wrecked here so that way
09:35 - when the if the mobs hit the players hit
09:37 - wrecked not if they hit the bigger outer
09:40 - rectangle of the
09:42 - image that way it won't look like they
09:44 - got you when they're not actually that
09:46 - close to you so all right so we need to
09:49 - go
09:51 - through and for each one that hit
09:54 - us we're going to take our
09:58 - player health and we're going to
10:01 - subtract whatever the mob damage is
10:04 - which we need to set as well so we're
10:06 - going to go here and we're going to say
10:08 - the
10:12 - mob damage is also 10 right again I'm
10:15 - just sticking with round numbers to get
10:18 - things working all that stuff can get
10:19 - adjusted later so we take away some
10:21 - health from the player okay I'm also
10:24 - going to
10:26 - have the mob stop brief just like when
10:29 - it get hit gets hit with the bullet like
10:31 - it swiped at you so it's a little little
10:33 - pause there and then we're also going
10:37 - to um say if the player's health is less
10:41 - than
10:45 - zero uh then the game is over right and
10:48 - that'll restart okay now if we run this
10:51 - we're going to see we have a couple of
10:53 - problems still okay one is see I'm dying
10:57 - right away when the mob hits me
11:00 - um so what you would see if we were
11:02 - showing the health bar yet is it would
11:04 - just instantly drop to zero and the
11:06 - reason for that is that the mob is
11:08 - colliding with the player and taking
11:10 - away but the next frame it's still
11:12 - colliding so we're basically permanently
11:16 - colliding so the health gets taken away
11:19 - really fast so what we need to do is one
11:23 - thing we could do is just say if the
11:24 - player gets
11:26 - hit okay if the player gets hit we're
11:28 - going to
11:30 - push the player back a little bit we're
11:31 - going to make the mobs knock you back
11:34 - just a little bit okay um so we want to
11:37 - take the player's velocity or sorry the
11:41 - player's position we're just going to
11:43 - knock him back a little
11:46 - distance and it's going to be
11:49 - something we'll call
11:52 - knockback and we're going to rotate that
11:55 - at whatever
11:57 - the
12:00 - uh Mob that hit
12:02 - us whatever its rotation is so notice
12:07 - I'm not doing it for each mob that hits
12:09 - if you get hit with multiple mobs we're
12:10 - just going to knock you back once
12:11 - because I want you to see how this works
12:13 - so we need to say uh
12:17 - Mob knockback and that's just going to
12:20 - be how what distance it knocks you back
12:22 - okay so Watch What Happens so now I get
12:25 - pushed back which is good right but
12:29 - look at that I get pushed inside the
12:32 - wall if you saw that
12:34 - happen so when I get
12:37 - hit just be because I just move I get
12:40 - pushed inside the wall and we don't want
12:44 - that the reason that I'm going inside
12:46 - the wall has to do with our collide with
12:49 - walls function
12:51 - here our collide with walls function
12:54 - only moves you and puts you against the
12:56 - side of a wall if you're moving because
12:59 - we were using the velocity we were
13:00 - saying if you were moving to the left or
13:02 - you're moving to the right well that's a
13:04 - problem now because we're hitting a wall
13:07 - without
13:11 - moving so we're going to change
13:14 - this and all I really needed to do is
13:17 - instead of checking to see if I was
13:19 - moving to the right I'm just going to
13:21 - say check to see if
13:25 - the
13:27 - walls Center
13:29 - is greater
13:33 - than the player's center right so if the
13:36 - player's
13:38 - Center is greater than the wall Center
13:41 - then I'm on the right hand side of the
13:45 - wall right and then same thing
13:49 - here in this direction we're just going
13:52 - to say if the center X
13:55 - is less
13:57 - than this the the player Cent X then we
14:00 - must be on the left hand side of the
14:01 - wall so we go against the right same
14:04 - idea
14:06 - in this one we're going to say if the
14:08 - center y right is greater
14:12 - than that
14:15 - oops so if the players the center of the
14:19 - player's rectangle is greater than then
14:22 - we must be
14:25 - underneath right so the Y gets put there
14:29 - and then the last one
14:32 - is this
14:35 - one is the center Y is less
14:39 - than okay so that should fix our wall
14:43 - Collision problem so now when I get
14:44 - pushed back I'm going to get against the
14:47 - wall there right and so if you get
14:49 - trapped in a corner you're going to have
14:51 - a problem right because you can't get
14:53 - pushed any further so you definitely
14:55 - don't want to get trapped in a
14:57 - corner
15:00 - okay and let's wrap this up
15:03 - by drawing the player Health on the
15:05 - screen so we can see it now I'm just
15:08 - going to add this at the top here um
15:11 - right now we only have for our HUD our
15:14 - headsup display uh we only have the
15:16 - player Health but eventually we're going
15:17 - to have more and we'll probably move
15:18 - these to a separate file but for right
15:21 - now since there's just one uh I'm going
15:23 - to put it here so I'm just going to
15:25 - define a a function called draw a player
15:28 - Health okay and what we pass to it is um
15:33 - what surface we want to draw on the X
15:36 - and Y where we want to draw it and the
15:38 - percentage of Health uh so we know how
15:41 - big to fill the bar okay and just in
15:46 - case we ever pass it a negative
15:50 - value then we will pin it at
15:54 - zero and now we need to do the size I'm
15:58 - just going to make the variables here
16:00 - real quick because again I just want to
16:01 - see how it looks so we're going to make
16:03 - the bar be 100 pixels wide and we'll
16:07 - make it be 20 pixels
16:10 - tall okay so the amount that's filled is
16:13 - the percentage times the
16:15 - bar bar length right that's going to be
16:19 - how much of it we fill in and we need
16:21 - two rectangles okay we need the
16:24 - outline we're just going to draw an
16:26 - outline of this box it's going to be a
16:29 - rectangle at X and Y and the length will
16:33 - be bar length and the height will be
16:35 - bar
16:37 - height and then the filled
16:40 - rectangle that's going to go inside it
16:43 - is also going to be at
16:44 - XY but its width is going to be that
16:48 - fill amount that we
16:50 - just calculated and the height can also
16:55 - be bar
16:57 - height now just like
17:00 - the when we did it with the zombie we
17:02 - want to figure out what
17:04 - color so if we're uh if our percentage
17:08 - is greater than 60% then the color is
17:12 - going to be
17:14 - green um and if it's greater than
17:20 - 0.3 color equals
17:23 - yellow
17:25 - and otherwise color equals red
17:29 - and then we just need to draw
17:33 - it so we're just going to draw a rect on
17:36 - the surface we said in the color we
17:39 - said using the fill wct and then we're
17:43 - going to draw the
17:47 - outline the surface I'm going to use
17:50 - white outline rect two pixels thick okay
17:54 - so there's our little HUD and then we'll
17:56 - go down to our draw section and just
17:59 - put it there right before we flip the
18:02 - display
18:05 - right I'm going to label this here
18:10 - HUD okay so we're just going to say draw
18:14 - player
18:17 - Health self.
18:19 - screen uh where do we want to put it I
18:21 - think I want to put it in the upper
18:23 - leftand corner so that means that uh I'm
18:27 - going to put it at
18:29 - at 1010 and the percentage is going to
18:33 - be whatever the player's health is
18:36 - divided by the
18:40 - uh total player
18:42 - Health okay let's take a look at that
18:46 - there's our bar and I'll let myself get
18:49 - hit and you can see it going
18:51 - down getting mobbed by zombies ah
18:57 - okay
18:59 - cool our game is dangerous
19:06 - now all right well that was another
19:08 - fairly long video pushing 20 minutes uh
19:11 - let me know in the comments below if
19:13 - that's a problem for you um if you like
19:15 - the shorter length or if you're cool
19:17 - with uh with these pushing uh pushing 20
19:19 - minutes with some of the more advanced
19:21 - stuff we're going to start doing as we
19:23 - progress with this game some things are
19:26 - going to start taking a little bit
19:27 - longer to explain and to implement and I
19:30 - don't want to
19:31 - break features up in the middle and
19:34 - continue them on separate videos I like
19:36 - to keep at least each video being one
19:39 - adding one thing to the game or one uh
19:41 - one new
19:42 - feature as always please hit the like
19:44 - button below and if you're not
19:46 - subscribed already please hit that
19:48 - subscribe button and if you have any
19:51 - questions or comments post them in the
