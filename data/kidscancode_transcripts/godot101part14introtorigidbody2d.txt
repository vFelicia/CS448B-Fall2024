00:00 - welcome back to the Dell 101 this is
00:02 - part 14 and in this lesson we're going
00:05 - to introduce the next of the physics
00:07 - bodies in the Godot engine the rigidbody
00:10 - 2d so I've started out here by making a
00:14 - simple scene using a rigidbody 2d which
00:17 - I've named crate and attached to it I
00:19 - have a sprite and a collision shape
00:21 - which I'm using this little crate image
00:24 - so it will look like something
00:26 - interesting and I'm just using a simple
00:28 - rectangle collision shape so to start
00:32 - with let's look at all the properties
00:33 - that we have with the rigidbody 2d now
00:38 - the first one here is mode and by
00:40 - default that's going to be set to rigid
00:42 - there are some other options here if you
00:45 - choose static you can have your
00:47 - rigidbody 2d behave like it was a static
00:50 - body meaning it won't move anymore
00:53 - you can have it behave like it was a
00:55 - kinematic body where you will have to
00:57 - use code to move it like when you use a
00:59 - kinematic body 2d you can also set it to
01:03 - character mode which means it's going to
01:05 - behave like a rigid body but it won't be
01:07 - able to rotate so you can move it around
01:10 - like it's character running around on
01:12 - the screen but it won't spin when it
01:14 - hits something that would make it spin
01:16 - so we're going to leave that rigid for
01:18 - right now and then there's a whole bunch
01:21 - of physical properties like mass and
01:23 - friction and gravity and we'll talk
01:26 - about what those things are a little bit
01:30 - later in the video but you'll see if we
01:32 - just run this scene if we've created the
01:34 - crate it's going to just fall like it's
01:38 - responding to gravity and that comes
01:40 - from this gravity scale setting right
01:43 - here if I increase that to a higher
01:46 - number which you will see it's going to
01:50 - fall a little bit faster so now that's
01:53 - not very exciting so I've created a
01:55 - quick little main scene here where I've
01:57 - just taken three static bodies and just
02:02 - laid them out here to be some walls that
02:04 - our object can collide with and then I'm
02:06 - going to put a instance of that crate
02:09 - here and don't want to resize it
02:13 - put an incidence of that crate here into
02:14 - our scene so now you can see when we
02:17 - play it the crate will fall and it will
02:20 - hit that static body and slide along it
02:22 - in a very realistic fashion now all of
02:29 - these physical properties will apply to
02:31 - how the object behaves when it interacts
02:34 - with the environment if we gave the
02:38 - shape a little bit less friction right
02:41 - if I set the friction to 0.5 then you're
02:44 - going to see when it hits the wall it's
02:46 - going to slide along it some right and
02:49 - before it comes to rest like the wall is
02:51 - a little more slippery you can go as low
02:54 - as zero and say you want no friction
02:57 - between the two objects in which case
03:00 - it's going to slide very freely but it
03:04 - doesn't bounce very much and the bounce
03:07 - is a separate value all right we can set
03:10 - that to something and see that the
03:14 - object will bounce now when it hits and
03:18 - slide like it has no friction so you can
03:22 - do all of this notice we haven't written
03:24 - any code so the rigidbody 2d is using
03:28 - godot's built-in physics engine to do
03:31 - all the calculations for how this
03:33 - objects should behave based on its
03:35 - collision shape and the properties that
03:38 - you've set and I'm going to set these
03:41 - back for a moment and so you can get
03:44 - some pretty complex behavior right out
03:46 - of the box just by using these
03:48 - properties so I'm going to duplicate
03:50 - this create a couple of times and make a
03:53 - little stack here so that we can see you
03:57 - know when we run the scene these crates
04:01 - will just fall and stay on top of each
04:03 - other and so if we have if we were to
04:06 - have a another crate over here and I'm
04:11 - going to give this create some starting
04:14 - velocity see here we can set a linear or
04:16 - an angular velocity so we can give it a
04:19 - starting speed and we can give it a
04:21 - rotational speed well I'm going to set
04:23 - the
04:26 - starting velocity to minus 500 in the X
04:29 - so it's going to be traveling to the
04:31 - left so when I hit play this crate is
04:34 - going to be flying to the left alright
04:38 - and you can see it bounces off those
04:40 - crates and falls to the ground
04:42 - now if this create were to have a larger
04:44 - mass like let's multiply that mass by 10
04:47 - and I were to do the same thing then now
04:51 - because that create wave so much more
04:53 - than the other ones it pushes them all
04:56 - aside and so you could play around with
05:00 - that and get all sorts of physics style
05:04 - behavior you know you can imagine making
05:06 - an Angry Birds type game that kind of
05:08 - thing very easily by combining these
05:12 - rigid bodies in in the way you want now
05:17 - when you do want to add additional
05:18 - behavior or control to a rigid body
05:21 - there are a whole bunch of methods that
05:24 - you get to be able to do that with but
05:27 - something you have to keep in mind with
05:28 - the rigid body is because it is part of
05:31 - the full physics simulation you can't
05:35 - just change the nodes location or change
05:40 - its velocity directly you have to apply
05:45 - forces to it right gravity is a force
05:48 - that's acting on it right now and you
05:50 - can add additional forces using the add
05:52 - force method there is also an apply
05:55 - impulse method which is kind of like
05:57 - giving it a kick right adding a force is
05:59 - going to be a steady force applying to
06:02 - the object an impulse is going to be an
06:05 - instantaneous force like you hit it with
06:08 - a stick or you pushed it and that's how
06:12 - you're going to make the object move so
06:15 - let's look at an example of that so
06:17 - we've got our crate and we're going to
06:19 - add a script okay
06:22 - and in this script in the in the ready
06:25 - function I'm just going to add a force
06:28 - and when you add a force you have two
06:32 - parameters the offset which is how far
06:35 - from the center you want the force
06:38 - applied
06:39 - so if you want it directly in the center
06:42 - you can leave that zero and then the
06:44 - second one is what the foot force you
06:46 - want alright let's put my foot zero
06:49 - minus 500 so what we're going to do is
06:55 - have this when this body starts it's
06:57 - going to have a an upward force being
07:00 - applied to it and of course what that's
07:03 - going to do is that's going to just
07:05 - barely counteract gravity so gravity is
07:09 - pulling down but I have a force pushing
07:11 - up which is cancelling it out
07:15 - so because we used add force this force
07:17 - is applied to the object permanently it
07:20 - will continually apply to the object
07:22 - until we choose to remove it by adding
07:26 - an equal and opposite force to cancel it
07:29 - out so you can apply lots of different
07:31 - forces and they will be the vectors will
07:34 - all be added together and you will have
07:36 - a resulting force that will be applied
07:38 - to the body now the other option that
07:42 - you have instead of that is an impulse
07:44 - which is an instantaneous kick so let's
07:48 - let's set input to true and then we're
07:53 - going to say if event dot is action
07:58 - pressed we're going to use UI select
08:01 - that's the spacebar now if the spacebar
08:05 - happens we're going to apply an impulse
08:07 - now when you apply an impulse you have
08:09 - the same options you have an offset
08:12 - which let's do it a little bit offset
08:15 - from the center and then you have a
08:19 - magnitude how much force do you want to
08:21 - apply so we'll do the same thing again
08:24 - we'll do that minus 500 upwards force so
08:27 - now whenever I press the spacebar this
08:30 - is going to be applied an instantaneous
08:32 - force is going to be applied to the
08:34 - object so we let it fall to the ground
08:37 - and then when we hit spacebar there you
08:39 - see and it rotated because the force was
08:42 - applied offset from the center so it's
08:45 - like I kicked it right here and every
08:47 - time I hit the spacebar that impulse is
08:51 - going to be applied
08:55 - so as another simple example let's
08:58 - change this event to mouse click and
09:01 - what we're going to do is whenever the
09:03 - mouse is clicked we want to get what
09:06 - direction the mouse pointer is in so the
09:10 - direction is going to be you need to get
09:12 - the global mouse position subtract the
09:17 - body's position and normalize it then
09:22 - now we have a direction vector pointing
09:23 - in the direction of where the mouse was
09:25 - clicked and we're going to apply an
09:26 - impulse like we did before and we're
09:31 - going to use that direction vector x say
09:34 - 800 so now go back over to our crate and
09:38 - let's set the gravity to zero so we
09:41 - won't be falling the crate will just
09:44 - hang there in space we're in zero
09:46 - gravity but if I click the mouse the
09:49 - crate is going to move in that direction
09:51 - and you can see because there's no
09:54 - gravity it's going to just keep going in
09:56 - whatever direction after it hits
09:58 - something and so something else that we
10:04 - can do is we can set this damping
10:08 - damping is lets you simulate basically a
10:11 - more viscous material like maybe the
10:14 - area maybe you're underwater instead of
10:16 - in the air and so this is how quickly
10:19 - the linear or angular velocity will be
10:21 - damped how quickly it will bleed away so
10:26 - if we do that now you'll see when I hit
10:29 - the click it does slowly come to a stop
10:35 - because it's more like it's under
10:40 - there's some sort of friction as it
10:42 - moves
10:47 - so that's a simple first look at the
10:50 - rigidbody2d
10:52 - and how to work with it in the next
10:55 - video we'll talk a little bit more about
10:57 - how to work with forces and control the
11:00 - rigidbody to get it to do what you
11:02 - wanted to do in your scene thanks for
11:05 - watching and I'll see you next time
11:15 - you
