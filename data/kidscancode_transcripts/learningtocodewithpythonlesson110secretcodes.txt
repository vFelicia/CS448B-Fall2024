00:00 - welcome back to learning to code with
00:01 - python lesson 10 today we're going to
00:04 - talk about cryptography or secret
00:07 - codes there are lots of different ways
00:10 - to encode secret
00:11 - messages the one we're going to talk
00:13 - about today is a very famous one called
00:16 - the Caesar Cipher the Caesar Cipher
00:19 - works like this you take the letters of
00:21 - the
00:22 - alphabet and then you shift those
00:25 - letters over a certain number of spaces
00:28 - the most famous the most common being 13
00:31 - spaces and you see now L lines up with y
00:35 - g lines up with t and so on and then you
00:38 - take your your message which is called
00:41 - the clear
00:42 - text and by looking up each letter and
00:45 - what the new letter is you have your
00:47 - secret code or your Cipher
00:51 - text so let's look at how we would start
00:53 - making the code for this well we know
00:56 - we're going to want to ask the person to
00:58 - input a clear
01:08 - text once they've put that in now we
01:10 - have something that we could encrypt now
01:13 - how do we do that well whatever they
01:15 - type in is going to be a string like
01:17 - this
01:20 - right so we want to do a loop where we
01:23 - go through each letter one at a time
01:26 - look up what the new letter is and save
01:29 - that in a new variable which we could
01:32 - call Cipher
01:34 - text so since this is something we might
01:37 - want to do over and over again it makes
01:40 - sense to define the encrypting as a
01:43 - function we can say def
01:46 - encrypt right and what you pass to the
01:50 - encrypt function the the argument will
01:52 - be the clear
01:56 - text okay and our Cipher text is just
01:59 - going to start out as nothing right we
02:03 - haven't done anything yet now we want to
02:05 - do that Loop through the clear text so
02:07 - we can say for each character and I'll
02:09 - just use car here for short for
02:12 - character for character in clear
02:16 - text okay so what do we want to do with
02:18 - each letter so let's pretend that our
02:23 - secret message and I'll just write this
02:24 - up here as a comment so we have
02:25 - something to look at let's pretend that
02:27 - our secret message is this
02:30 - so when we start our Loop the first
02:34 - character is going to be S so we need to
02:36 - figure out what s is going to become
02:39 - well over here on our chart we see s
02:42 - should become F well how do we get there
02:45 - well if the shift is 13 we know we need
02:48 - to count 13 spaces from s we need to add
02:51 - 13 1 2 3 4 5 6
02:56 - 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 see s becomes
03:02 - F so we need a copy of the alphabet that
03:06 - we can look at and
03:11 - count so let's make a variable with all
03:13 - the letters of the alphabet in it we'll
03:15 - call it Alpha for short and this will
03:18 - just
03:21 - be n o p QR s t u v WX y z there we go
03:27 - so that's all the letters of the
03:28 - alphabet so now if the character that
03:31 - we're on is s we just need to find where
03:34 - s is in this
03:37 - string and add 13 to it right and if we
03:43 - get go off the end we need to go back
03:45 - around to the start there are 26 letters
03:48 - in the alphabet so the positions of each
03:52 - of these will be from zero to
03:55 - 25 so when we count we count up to 25 if
03:59 - if we get to 26 we need to go back to
04:06 - zero but we have two other problems we
04:08 - need to consider what if the secret
04:10 - message has capital letters in
04:16 - it right the letter capital T never
04:19 - appears in here so we have two choices
04:22 - we could make a whole another list of
04:25 - all the capital letters and we could
04:28 - count those separately
04:30 - or we can just use a handy little
04:33 - function that python has where we take
04:35 - the clear text after the person types it
04:37 - in and we convert it to lowercase so the
04:41 - lower
04:42 - function can be added to any string and
04:45 - it will take all the characters in the
04:47 - string and just convert them to
04:49 - lowercase okay our other problem is what
04:54 - if they have characters that are not in
04:56 - the
04:57 - alphabet so that's so
05:01 - cool what do we do with this
05:04 - apostrophe well typically in simple
05:07 - examples like this you ignore
05:09 - punctuation or numbers we're we're going
05:12 - to ignore any characters in the message
05:14 - that are not actually part of the
05:18 - alphabet so that means as we're going
05:20 - through the characters the first thing
05:22 - we need to check is just to see is the
05:25 - character in the alphabet so is it one
05:28 - of these right if it is then we'll
05:32 - encrypt it but if it isn't we'll just
05:36 - ignore it and add it to the cipher text
05:38 - so we'll just say Cipher text plus
05:41 - equals character right so when it's a
05:45 - apostrophe it's not in the alphabet so
05:47 - we'll just add it to the cipher text
05:49 - without changing it to anything
05:51 - else so now we need to figure
05:54 - out what is this what is this how do we
05:56 - get this s to turn into the right
05:58 - character
06:00 - well first we need to find where is the
06:02 - s in the alphabet well there's another
06:06 - handy string function called find if we
06:09 - say alpha.
06:12 - find the way this works is it says
06:15 - whatever character this is find it in
06:17 - Alpha so it will go through Alpha and
06:19 - it'll find where the S is and it'll give
06:21 - us back the position which for S happens
06:23 - to be
06:25 - 18 so that's where the S is but we want
06:27 - to find where the new we want to find
06:29 - the new position of the new letter we
06:31 - want so let's make a variable here
06:35 - called new pause and we'll save that in
06:37 - there so we want to take where the S is
06:41 - and add 13 to
06:43 - it okay so that's going to work fine if
06:46 - our position if our starting character
06:49 - is over on the lower half of the
06:51 - alphabet because when we add 13 to it
06:53 - we'll end up over here somewhere but
06:56 - problem is with our s we're taking 18
06:58 - and we're adding 13 which gives us
07:01 - 31 and obviously there's no character 31
07:04 - we want to wrap around again so what we
07:06 - really want to do is take that 31 and
07:08 - subtract uh 26 from it and that gives us
07:13 - five which is where we want to be 0 one
07:15 - two three four five the
07:18 - F so we could write some code that says
07:23 - if the new pause is greater than
07:26 - 26 then subtract 26 from the new pause
07:30 - but there's an easier way if we use that
07:33 - remainder operator that we talked about
07:36 - early on in the course and what we want
07:38 - to do is divide by 26 and take the
07:42 - remainder what's left over let's try it
07:44 - out and see how that works if we have a
07:46 - number that's less than
07:47 - 26 and we say what's the remainder well
07:52 - 26 doesn't go into it at all so the
07:54 - whole thing is left over and so that's
07:57 - fine if we have a small number this
07:58 - won't change it any but if we have a
08:00 - bigger number than 26 and we divide by
08:04 - 26 then it goes into there once and then
08:07 - there's some left over well there's five
08:09 - left over that gives us the F we want so
08:12 - now we have the correct new pause for
08:14 - our new character that we need for our
08:16 - Cipher
08:18 - text so let's add that letter to our
08:21 - Cipher text so now Cipher text is just
08:23 - going to have added to it Alpha index
08:28 - new pause
08:30 - right so in the case of the S we got
08:33 - five so Alpha number five gets added to
08:36 - Cipher text which is the F and then so
08:40 - on and then we're done with our Loop
08:41 - we'll go around again we'll do the E
08:44 - we'll go around again we'll do the C and
08:46 - we should be
08:48 - done so now when we finish going through
08:51 - each
08:52 - character in the clear text our Cipher
08:55 - text should now be complete so at the
08:58 - end of our loop after after the for Loop
08:59 - completes we can return the cipher
09:08 - text okay our encrypt function is now
09:11 - complete it does everything it needs to
09:13 - do it takes the clear text goes through
09:15 - character by character figures out where
09:18 - the new position is if it's in the
09:21 - alphabet if it's not in the alphabet it
09:22 - ignores it and then when it's done it
09:25 - gives you back the cipher text so down
09:27 - here we should be able to say
09:30 - print
09:33 - encrypt clear
09:36 - text so we'll type in the clear text and
09:39 - then we'll print out the cipher
09:44 - text so we'll just save
09:47 - this
09:49 - as
09:51 - Caesar and we'll give it a run and see
09:53 - what
09:55 - happens all right let's try secret
09:57 - message first since we know what that
10:00 - should come out as okay so there's our
10:03 - encrypted text is that the same as our
10:06 - example it
10:11 - is now we can try it with anything else
10:15 - we care to try let's try it with
10:17 - something that
10:19 - has uh
10:21 - non-alphabetical characters in it so if
10:24 - we say that's so cool exclamation point
10:26 - so it should it should convert the T to
10:28 - a lower case
10:29 - it should ignore the apostrophe it
10:31 - should ignore the ex exclamation
10:34 - point so that's our Caesar Cipher
10:36 - program now what's cool about the Caesar
10:39 - Cipher since we're using 13 as our
10:42 - shift uh 13 is exactly halfway through
10:45 - the alphabet so subtracting 13 and
10:48 - adding 13 is actually the same thing so
10:51 - if you run your
10:54 - program if we run the program and we
10:57 - paste in
10:59 - the encrypted
11:01 - text we'll actually get
11:05 - back the clear text now that only works
11:08 - if the shift is 13 you're welcome to
11:11 - change this 13 to any other number you
11:13 - want but it won't work in Reverse
11:15 - anymore if you do that then you're going
11:17 - to need to make a function called
11:19 - decrypt that does the exact same process
11:22 - goes through character by character but
11:24 - each time it subtracts the shift instead
11:28 - of adding it
11:29 - and then you could use whichever
11:30 - function you wanted encrypt function to
11:33 - encrypt things decrypt function to
11:35 - decrypt things I'll leave that as an
11:37 - exercise for you to try
11:39 - out so that's the end of this lesson
11:42 - next time we'll start talking about
