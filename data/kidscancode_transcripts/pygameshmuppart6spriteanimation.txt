00:00 - welcome back to the pame game
00:03 - development series we are working on a
00:06 - schmu this is part six and in this video
00:09 - we're going to talk about animated
00:12 - Sprites how do you make a Sprite that
00:14 - has a changing image an image that
00:17 - changes over
00:19 - time so where we are right now is we
00:22 - have our ship and we have our meteors
00:25 - flying through space at us and we can
00:27 - shoot them but the meteors a little
00:30 - boring because they're all facing the
00:33 - same way and they would probably look a
00:34 - little better if they rotated if we
00:36 - could have them looking like tumbling
00:39 - asteroids so that means we want to have
00:42 - those Sprites be
00:44 - animated so how we go about that well
00:48 - let's look at our mob Sprite
00:51 - here so we're using this image and as
00:55 - you saw up in the player we used a pame
00:58 - transform command to change this scale
01:01 - of the player Sprite well there's also a
01:03 - rotate transformation you can do on
01:06 - Sprites as well so we could take that
01:09 - meteor image and apply a rotation to it
01:13 - and then it would turn uh and if we did
01:15 - that over and over again we could make
01:18 - it rotate all the way around in the
01:21 - circle um the problem is that we don't
01:23 - want to rotate it every frame of the
01:26 - animation because we're running at 60
01:28 - frames per second
01:30 - the the Sprite would rotate really
01:32 - really fast so whenever you're doing any
01:35 - animation in a Sprite you also need to
01:38 - figure out a timing for how quickly you
01:42 - want that image to change so we're going
01:45 - to need to set up a few things to make
01:47 - that happen so first of all just to make
01:51 - the Sprite rotate we're going to create
01:54 - a variable called uh I'm just going to
01:56 - call it rot short for rotation um and
01:59 - that's going to be far in degrees the
02:02 - Sprite should be rotated okay so it
02:04 - starts out not rotated and then it's
02:05 - going to start
02:06 - going um and then we're also going to
02:08 - set up a rotation speed okay and that's
02:11 - going to just be a random
02:14 - um a random number that'll control how
02:17 - fast our Sprite is rotating basically
02:19 - how many degrees it's going to rotate
02:21 - every time we do it uh that way we can
02:24 - have them tumbling in different
02:27 - directions okay so we'll make that
02:29 - between minus 8 and
02:32 - 8 um and then to do the timing remember
02:36 - we have a clock object right we that we
02:39 - created back when we initialized the
02:41 - game this clock thing is keeping track
02:44 - of how quickly the game is going and
02:46 - making sure it runs it 60 frames per
02:47 - second well it also means it's counting
02:49 - time so we can use that to count how
02:53 - long it's been since the last time we
02:56 - updated the image and if we do that we
02:59 - set a a particular value there we can
03:01 - say is it time to rotate the image again
03:04 - if it is we'll do it if it isn't we'll
03:06 - wait okay so we're going to call that um
03:10 - the
03:12 - last last update so this will be the
03:15 - time that we last updated okay command
03:18 - for that is get ticks a tick is a tick
03:21 - of the clock so this will get however
03:24 - many ticks it's been since the game
03:27 - started since the clock was started
03:30 - and this will every time we update every
03:33 - time we we rotate the image we'll update
03:35 - this variable to keep track of when that
03:40 - happened now we're ready to update now
03:43 - we're going to need
03:44 - a a few lines of code to make the
03:47 - rotation happen and we need to do it in
03:49 - our update so that it uh will check
03:52 - every frame of the animation if it's
03:53 - time to update yet um but I don't want
03:56 - my update function to get too Crow into
04:00 - to full of code so I'm going to just say
04:02 - that every time we update we need to
04:06 - rotate or check to see if it's time to
04:08 - rotate and that way we can Define rotate
04:12 - separately and that's useful because it
04:16 - keeps everything organized and the
04:17 - rotation code is all separated in this
04:19 - rotate function also if you ever want to
04:22 - turn rotation off you can just comment
04:24 - this right here and then it won't ever
04:28 - do the rotate so there we have that now
04:31 - we're ready to figure
04:33 - out how to do the
04:36 - rotation the first we need to find out
04:39 - is it time to rotate yet so we need to
04:42 - figure out what time it is
04:45 - now and so we'll do the get tix command
04:48 - again and now if whatever time it is now
04:52 - minus whatever time it was the last time
04:55 - we
04:56 - updated right and doing that will mean
05:00 - if now is uh equal to a th000 and last
05:05 - update was equal to 900 then 1,000 - 900
05:08 - it's been 100 milliseconds since the
05:10 - last time we updated so this little
05:14 - subtraction here tells you how long it's
05:15 - been in milliseconds so we're going to
05:18 - say if that's greater than 50 then it's
05:19 - time to rotate again so we can take our
05:25 - last update variable and set it equal to
05:29 - now cuz we're rotating now and now is
05:32 - when we need to talk about something
05:34 - important about how this rotate uh
05:36 - transform is going to work so I'm going
05:38 - to show you first the wrong way to do it
05:42 - so don't copy me on this I want you to
05:44 - see why uh we're going to need to do it
05:47 - in a certain way so you might think you
05:49 - could just say well I just want to take
05:50 - the image and rotate it so I'll do
05:54 - transform.
05:55 - rotate on my image and put what whatever
05:59 - the r speed is so like if rotation speed
06:02 - was one then I'm just going to rotate
06:04 - the the image one
06:07 - degree um and you might think that would
06:09 - work but this is what will
06:12 - happen all right so you see how my
06:16 - meteors get completely scrambled around
06:19 - everything starts lagging it's a huge
06:25 - problem fact it lag so much it's hard to
06:28 - close the program eventually we'll
06:30 - close there we go so why did that happen
06:35 - well the thing about this rotate command
06:37 - is when it takes an image and rotates it
06:40 - that process loses a tiny tiny amount of
06:44 - information from the
06:46 - image the pixel information from that
06:49 - image and that's fine if you just rotate
06:51 - it once but every time you do it you're
06:53 - losing a tiny bit so doing it over and
06:55 - over again eventually you're losing so
06:57 - much information that the image becomes
07:00 - scrambled beyond
07:02 - recognition so we don't want to do it
07:05 - that way what we really want to do
07:08 - is rotate the original image the nice
07:12 - clean image and take that and rotate it
07:16 - however far we want it
07:17 - rotated so the way we do that is we're
07:19 - going to go up here and we're going to
07:20 - call the meteor image we're going to
07:23 - make this the original image
07:26 - okay and we're going to set our Sprites
07:30 - image equal to a copy of
07:33 - that so we're going to take the original
07:36 - image and make a copy okay so the image
07:40 - will be a copy of that original but now
07:41 - we have this nice original that we're
07:44 - not going to make any changes
07:46 - to so then back down here in our
07:49 - rotate what we can do is
07:52 - say rotate
07:54 - the original image but we don't want to
07:57 - rotate at the rotation anymore we want
08:00 - to figure
08:02 - out how much we're supposed to rotate it
08:04 - all together so if we're keeping track
08:07 - of how far we're rotating so we rotated
08:09 - 90 degrees then next we're going to need
08:11 - to rotate it to 92 and then 94 and then
08:14 - 96 Etc so we want to take our whatever
08:17 - our rotation is and
08:19 - add the uh rot speed and that'll give us
08:24 - our new rotation but what happens when
08:26 - our rotation gets to be bigger than 3 60
08:30 - right if we're at 360 degrees and we
08:32 - rotate a degree we'd be at
08:35 - 361 we don't want this rotation to just
08:37 - keep getting bigger and bigger and
08:38 - bigger uh we want it to just loop back
08:41 - around to to one again and we can do
08:44 - that by just taking this and using the
08:48 - remainder
08:50 - operator which just says divide by 360
08:53 - divide whatever you got by 360 so if
08:55 - we're at 361 and give me what's left
08:57 - over so 360 divided by or 361 divid 360
09:02 - is one with one left over so it gives me
09:04 - that one left over so now my rotation is
09:06 - equal to one so that's a great way to
09:08 - keep a number from going over a certain
09:11 - amount make it loop around so we count
09:13 - up 359 360 or sorry 359 01 two like that
09:19 - and then we rotate that original image
09:21 - by that amount and that's going to make
09:24 - everything look much better see now I
09:28 - have nice rotating images but you might
09:30 - see see that one see them rotating a
09:32 - little oddly now we have another thing
09:35 - to keep uh track of and that is our
09:39 - rectangles aren't good
09:44 - anymore and what do I mean by the
09:46 - rectangles not being good well I've made
09:48 - a quick little example here of a program
09:50 - that will um rotate
09:54 - a ship on the screen so I took the ship
09:57 - image and I said rotate it just keep
09:59 - Rota it around like we're doing with the
10:00 - meteors now you can see how it's not
10:02 - rotating
10:04 - very cleanly it's bouncing around why is
10:07 - it bouncing around like that well if I
10:09 - draw a rectangle there you can see this
10:12 - a little better so when we originally
10:14 - created the image we created that rect
10:16 - around it but now we're rotating that
10:18 - image and it doesn't always fit inside
10:20 - that rect anymore so what happens is is
10:23 - every time you rotate it you need to
10:25 - figure out a new rectangle that fits
10:28 - around that
10:31 - image and then you want to take that
10:33 - rectangle and make sure you keep it
10:37 - centered at the same spot always so we
10:39 - want this rectangle to change size and
10:41 - shape based on whatever the image is and
10:43 - we also want it
10:44 - to uh stay centered so it looks like the
10:47 - ship is rotating around its Center okay
10:50 - and we can do that uh I'll show you what
10:53 - that looks
10:55 - like looks like this see every time the
10:57 - ship rotates we figure out a new
10:59 - rectangle that encloses it which
11:01 - sometimes gets bigger and smaller
11:02 - depending on you know how it fits around
11:05 - the image but it always stays centered
11:07 - in the same place so my ship looks like
11:10 - it's just turning in a circle and that's
11:13 - what we want to do with our meteors as
11:17 - well okay so if we come back over here
11:20 - to our rotate function
11:24 - here this rotated image is going to be
11:27 - our we're going to call this our the new
11:29 - image so this is the new image that
11:31 - we're going to
11:32 - use and we also need to figure out
11:35 - where where was our
11:39 - Center so our our oops so our rectangle
11:41 - is centered right now at this old center
11:45 - right so now we can set our image to the
11:48 - new image and we can get our new uh get
11:52 - our new rectangle which is image. getet
11:56 - rect so now we have our new rectangle
11:59 - and we'll take our new rectangle and
12:00 - we'll put its Center at the same spot as
12:03 - the old Center was and that will do
12:06 - exactly what you saw that ship doing
12:08 - replace the image with the new one
12:10 - figure out its new rectangle and keep it
12:12 - centered at the same spot the old one
12:14 - was now our rotating meteors are going
12:17 - to look quite
12:18 - nice tumbling through
12:21 - space some fast some
12:26 - slow and everything else will work just
12:28 - fine can still shoot them um and we can
12:31 - still be hit by
12:35 - them okay so one other thing I wanted to
12:37 - do uh for this video is make those
12:41 - meteors a little more interesting by
12:42 - using um a bunch of different images for
12:45 - them if we go back over to our files
12:49 - here um in the art pack there were all
12:51 - sorts of different size meteors big
12:54 - small even tiny ones um and what I'd
12:57 - like is for my Sprites to just be
12:59 - randomly picking one of these so that we
13:01 - have different looking meteors instead
13:03 - of all being exactly the
13:05 - same so I'm just going to move this over
13:08 - here so I can see the list so what we
13:10 - want to do is instead of loading this
13:13 - one
13:15 - image we're going to make a list called
13:17 - meteor images and that's going to be
13:20 - empty right now but that's going to hold
13:21 - all of our images so that we can
13:24 - randomly choose one out of that
13:26 - list so what we need to do is make a a
13:29 - list here of
13:32 - um of the files that we're going to use
13:35 - okay so I'm going to
13:38 - put I'm going to put the
13:41 - meteor um meteor
13:47 - Brown uh big
13:50 - one.png okay I'm just going to copy this
13:52 - in a few times so that I don't have to
13:54 - retype
13:57 - it we'll wrap this around
14:03 - and got one
14:06 - more um and then we can just fix them
14:10 - so there we go so I want big one big
14:15 - two I have medium one and medium
14:20 - two I have small
14:24 - one and small
14:28 - two
14:30 - and I have
14:32 - tiny number one okay so now I have this
14:36 - is the list of all those file names that
14:38 - we want to load so we can now just do a
14:41 - little Loop
14:42 - [Music]
14:43 - through the medior list this meteor list
14:46 - of files and each time we want to just
14:49 - do the image load on it so we're going
14:51 - to say meteor images.
14:57 - append and what we want to pend is py
15:01 - game. image.
15:04 - load path.
15:06 - jooin the image
15:08 - dur uh with the whatever file name we're
15:13 - doing um we don't want to forget to do.
15:16 - convert and then at the end of this Loop
15:19 - we'll have a meteor
15:20 - list a list of meteors and meteor images
15:23 - that's full of all the right images and
15:27 - we can go up to our mob here and instead
15:29 - of loading this one image we're going to
15:32 - say random.
15:34 - choice of
15:35 - meteor images and then we should be
15:39 - randomly
15:41 - picking oops looks like I made a typo in
15:43 - my list oh yep missing a comma right
15:48 - there that'll be a problem so now there
15:52 - we go so now sometimes I've got big ones
15:54 - sometimes I've got small ones the big
15:56 - ones are not appearing far enough off
15:58 - the screen so we probably want to move
16:01 - them up a little
16:02 - bit this y that we picked this random Y
16:05 - is probably too
16:07 - small so it will go from there to
16:14 - there so that they appear off the screen
16:17 - now we get the nice big ones the tiny
16:22 - ones
16:27 - okay
16:33 - and that will do it for this video see
16:35 - you next
16:47 - time
