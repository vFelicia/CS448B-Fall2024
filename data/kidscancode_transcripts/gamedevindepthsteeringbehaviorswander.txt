00:00 - okay welcome back for another game
00:02 - development in-depth topic we're gonna
00:04 - be talking about steering behaviors
00:06 - again this is part two we're going to
00:09 - talk about the wander behavior how you
00:11 - can make an agent a sprite a mob wander
00:16 - around in a somewhat random fashion if
00:22 - you haven't watched part 1 of the series
00:25 - before please do that first I'll put a
00:27 - link below here because we're gonna
00:30 - build on some of the stuff that we
00:31 - explained in the first video and it will
00:34 - definitely be less confusing if you do
00:36 - that so we're starting again with our
00:41 - standard sprite that just spawns and
00:45 - moves in a straight line in a random
00:47 - direction and what I want this bright to
00:50 - do now is instead of seeking the mouse
00:53 - like we did in the previous video I want
00:55 - it to just wander randomly around the
00:58 - screen and so one way we could do that
01:02 - is we could take our seek function that
01:06 - we described in the last video and we
01:10 - could just pick a random target so we
01:14 - could add to our sprite here that we're
01:18 - gonna pick a random target and that
01:20 - target needs to be somewhere a random
01:23 - spot on the screen
01:30 - so maybe between the width and the Y
01:34 - will be zero and height zero I highlight
01:39 - so we're gonna pick a random spot on the
01:43 - screen to be our target and then we're
01:46 - just going to have that target move
01:48 - around right so we're going to jump
01:50 - around to different locations but I
01:54 - don't want to do it every frame because
01:55 - that's going to be too fast so we're
01:58 - gonna keep track of when the last time
02:00 - we switch to the target was and just
02:02 - measure the time to the next one so
02:06 - let's make our function called wander
02:09 - and so what this is going to do is we're
02:15 - going to check what time it is and if
02:23 - it's been long enough
02:29 - let's do we'll do half a second okay
02:34 - then last target equals now and we pick
02:39 - another new random target so I'll just
02:42 - grab this alright and we'll duplicate
02:46 - that there and then since we have a new
02:49 - target we can just seek
02:57 - that target all right so now we're gonna
03:05 - use our seek function we made before and
03:07 - instead of sneaking the mouse we're
03:09 - gonna sneak that random target that we
03:11 - just spawned on the screen and so in our
03:16 - update all we have to do is just set
03:19 - acceleration to wander and then we'll
03:26 - wonder in a random direction okay now to
03:31 - try this out we're going to self dot
03:35 - seek we're just going to run this
03:38 - program it's going to write and we're
03:40 - gonna pick every 500 milliseconds we're
03:43 - gonna pick a new target and seek towards
03:45 - that target now I have put in the draw
03:48 - vectors again so that we can see what's
03:51 - going on when we run it so there is our
03:54 - wandering sprite and if I turn on the
03:58 - vectors you can see that well scion dot
04:02 - is our random spots that we're picking
04:03 - and we just steer towards it whenever it
04:08 - changes and that's sine but it does look
04:13 - kind of robotic and artificial there's a
04:16 - lot of really sudden Direction changes
04:20 - and doesn't really look like a person
04:24 - wandering around and so we could look at
04:30 - a better way of doing the wandering
04:32 - behavior you know this is a much more
04:35 - sophisticated way of doing it and it may
04:38 - seem more complicated at first but it's
04:39 - actually really simple to implement and
04:42 - it gives you a lot of flexibility in how
04:43 - you can tune your wandering behavior so
04:46 - let's look at a diagram so just to
04:51 - refresh your memory when we did our seek
04:54 - behavior we had our we had our sprites
04:58 - velocity and then we calculated what our
05:01 - desired velocity was and then the
05:03 - steering force is some vector pushing us
05:07 - in that direction
05:09 - well for the wondering what we want to
05:11 - do is we want to imagine a circle
05:15 - imagine a circle that's some distance
05:18 - ahead of the player in the direction of
05:20 - their velocity and then we pick a random
05:23 - spot on the circumference of that circle
05:26 - and that becomes our target so our
05:30 - desired vector points towards that and
05:33 - so our steering force is going to pull
05:35 - us towards that desired target and if we
05:41 - change this random spot on the circle
05:45 - every frame of the animation we just
05:47 - keep picking a new one every time then
05:50 - sometimes the target will be you know
05:54 - the difference between the velocity and
05:56 - the desired will be big sometimes it
05:58 - will be small so we'll make small turns
05:59 - sometimes big turns sometimes and what
06:03 - this allows you to do is tune it by
06:05 - setting these three variables you can
06:08 - change how big you decide to make the
06:10 - circle you can change how far ahead that
06:14 - circle is and then of course just like
06:17 - this were you can adjust the steering
06:18 - force to say how fast the sprite will
06:21 - adjust its velocity okay so let's look
06:25 - at how we're going to implement that so
06:29 - I'm going to define I'm going to call
06:36 - this wander improved so that we can keep
06:39 - the old one there so you can compare the
06:41 - two when you want to okay so first we
06:45 - need to pick where our circle position
06:48 - is going to be okay and actually let's
06:52 - go up here and set some of these
06:53 - variables so we're going to have our we
06:57 - would call it the wander ring we're
07:02 - going to set the distance and let's set
07:04 - that to 200 pixels ahead of the player
07:06 - and then we're going to have the wander
07:11 - ring radius and this is going to be how
07:14 - big that ring is let's set that to 50
07:19 - okay so now we can go down here and we
07:21 - can say that our circle position where
07:25 - do we want to go our circle position is
07:27 - going to be whatever our player's
07:29 - position is plus our velocity which
07:35 - we're going to normalize so that it's a
07:37 - length of 1 times the wandering distance
07:42 - so the centre of the circle is going to
07:44 - be some distance ahead of our player
07:49 - that we set in the wandering distance
07:51 - and then our target is going to be that
07:58 - position plus some vector pointing from
08:05 - the center of the circle to its to its
08:10 - edge right so that means we want it to
08:11 - be the length of this to be the radius
08:14 - and we're going to just rotate it in a
08:17 - random direction by a random angle all
08:23 - right so we know that this vector will
08:26 - be a length the length will be equal to
08:28 - the radius of the circle that we chose
08:30 - and it will just be pointing in a random
08:32 - direction and that's going to be our
08:33 - target on the edge of the circle and I'm
08:38 - going to just say find out the seek self
08:46 - dot seek that target okay that's all we
08:53 - need to do but just for the purposes of
08:55 - drawing the vector I'm gonna call this
08:59 - the displacement okay just so that we
09:03 - have something to be able to draw on the
09:05 - screen so we don't need this at all for
09:08 - this to work okay but I am going to go
09:12 - down here and I'm going to replace the
09:16 - drawing of that target circle with we're
09:18 - gonna draw the the actual ring and the
09:22 - displacement line so we can see what it
09:23 - looks like so now we just need to say
09:26 - here and so doing wander to wander
09:28 - improved
09:31 - now when we run you can see we're not
09:34 - moving around so randomly right
09:36 - we're only wandering a little bit and if
09:39 - we turn on vectors you can see there's
09:44 - the ring being drawn that distance ahead
09:46 - of the player and so the desired
09:52 - velocity is just fluctuating around by
09:54 - some plus or minus amount based on how
09:57 - ring how big that ring is and that looks
10:06 - pretty nice and so this is only
10:07 - wandering a little bit right and we can
10:09 - also adjust some of these variables like
10:11 - for example if I wanted my steering
10:13 - force to be bigger and I can also
10:16 - increase the radius of the ring then we
10:18 - have a bigger circle that we're going to
10:22 - look at and now the wandering is going
10:24 - to look like this so you see we have a
10:27 - much bigger circle so those new just the
10:31 - new desired vectors can be spread out
10:34 - much further and then we also have the
10:38 - ring being much closer relative to its
10:41 - size and so we get more we get more
10:47 - turning happening and so depending on
10:50 - what your desired result is how you want
10:53 - this wandering behavior to look you can
10:56 - set those variables differently and
10:58 - you'll get very different results but
11:01 - you'll never get that kind of sudden
11:04 - turn on a dime just reverse and just
11:07 - turn around and go back like the like
11:09 - the mob forgot something that you got
11:11 - when you just picked random targets so
11:15 - that's the wander behavior so hopefully
11:19 - you're starting to see the power of
11:22 - these behaviors
11:24 - you know the seek behavior is a very
11:27 - useful one to use on its own but also we
11:31 - used it to build up our or wandering
11:34 - behavior by by intelligently picking a
11:37 - target and then just using that seek
11:39 - function again and what you'll find as
11:42 - we go into
11:44 - and starts flowing some other behaviors
11:45 - is that it's while these behaviors are
11:49 - strong on them on their own
11:51 - the real power comes when you start
11:52 - combining them together and and we'll
11:56 - explore that as well how you can get
11:58 - some really amazing intelligent seeming
12:02 - behavior out of your your AI agents just
12:05 - by combining simple little things like
12:07 - this I mean look at these functions
12:08 - there's four lines of code and there's
12:10 - five lines of code here they're not very
12:13 - complicated but they give you really
12:15 - nice complicated seeming effects all
