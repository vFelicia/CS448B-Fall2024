00:00 - welcome to part 4 of the Godot 101
00:02 - introduced 3 D series in the previous
00:05 - part we made a kinematic character that
00:08 - we could control using the mouse and the
00:10 - keyboard and in this installment we're
00:13 - going to make a few different objects
00:15 - that this character can interact with
00:17 - this time we're going to look at 3d area
00:19 - nodes areas are used for two main
00:22 - purposes detection meaning they detect
00:25 - when bodies or other areas overlap and
00:29 - influence which means they can alter the
00:32 - physics in a certain area change gravity
00:34 - change friction things like that so
00:37 - we're going to use area to create three
00:38 - different types of objects in our scene
00:40 - a coin that the character can pick up a
00:43 - bullet that the character can shoot and
00:46 - spikes that'll do damage if you run into
00:49 - them before we start making the objects
00:51 - go into the project settings and we're
00:54 - gonna set up some physics layers so in
00:58 - later names 3d physics let's name the
01:02 - first layer environment that's gonna
01:06 - contain our ground and the platforms and
01:10 - things like that
01:11 - layer two we're gonna call the player
01:12 - and layer three we're gonna call pickups
01:16 - what this will do is make it a lot
01:18 - easier for us to organize which objects
01:21 - can interact with other objects so a
01:24 - pickup for example should detect when
01:26 - the player touches it but it shouldn't
01:29 - care about the environment the ground
01:30 - isn't gonna pick up the coin so let's
01:33 - close that and let's open up our
01:35 - character scene and let's make sure that
01:39 - the layers for this are set too if we
01:43 - click the little dot dot here you can
01:44 - see let's make sure the player is in the
01:48 - player layer and for its mask
01:53 - environment because we want to make sure
01:54 - that it still keeps seeing the
01:56 - environment so let's start by making the
02:00 - coin gonna go into our assets and find
02:03 - the coin gold model and we're going to
02:06 - make a new inherited scene
02:09 - and I'm going to take the scene route
02:11 - and right-click on it and choose change
02:13 - type so I can make this an area and
02:16 - while I'm there lets rename that to
02:19 - claim gold and in the collision we're
02:23 - gonna set it to the layer we wanted on
02:27 - is the pickup's layer and the mask that
02:30 - we want is player we don't want it to
02:34 - check the environment alright now we
02:38 - need to make a collision shape before we
02:39 - do that you'll notice that the way that
02:42 - this scene happens to be set up the way
02:44 - it was exported in the art pack the coin
02:47 - itself the coin mesh itself is offset so
02:51 - I'm going to change that to zero zero
02:52 - zero in the translation so now it's
02:58 - centered on the origin and we're gonna
03:00 - add a collision shape so just add
03:04 - collision shape and this the shape that
03:07 - we will probably want to use is cylinder
03:10 - so there's a cylinder and if we change
03:14 - that cylinder by rotating it 90 degrees
03:18 - it's going to the transform and rotate
03:21 - it if you see the orientation here we
03:23 - want to rotate around this axis which is
03:26 - the Z so we're going to rotate around Z
03:28 - by 90 degrees and then you can just
03:33 - scale it down so that it fits the shape
03:36 - of the coin about like that maybe a
03:44 - little wider there we go so now we have
03:48 - our coin ready to go save that now all
03:54 - we want this going to do is disappear if
03:55 - the player runs into it so it looks like
03:57 - they picked it up so if we add a script
03:59 - to the coin all we want to do is click
04:03 - on area and connect its body entered
04:07 - signal connect that body entered signal
04:11 - and we already know because we set the
04:14 - collision layers that the only body that
04:17 - it's going to detect is one that's on
04:19 - the player layer and that's all we care
04:21 - about so let's just add q4
04:23 - there so if any body is detected
04:25 - entering the shape we're gonna delete
04:29 - the coin and that should do it so let's
04:31 - jump over to our to our scene and we can
04:35 - throw a couple of these coins in here
04:38 - or even one to start with so let's just
04:41 - grab a coin throw that in there and
04:45 - we'll put it right there on the platform
04:50 - and we'll run run up there and poof the
05:00 - coin is gone all right one other thing I
05:03 - want to do this coin is I clicked on the
05:06 - mesh and I made it a little bit bigger
05:08 - because I thought it was a little on the
05:10 - small side so I scaled it up by 20% 1.2
05:13 - and then I made the collision shape just
05:15 - a little bit bigger too to match and the
05:19 - other thing is the coins are kind of
05:21 - boring just sitting there not moving so
05:22 - we're gonna add an animation player so
05:25 - that we can make them spin so I'm going
05:28 - to add a new animation call it spin it's
05:33 - one second long we're going to make sure
05:36 - we're at the start of the track here and
05:37 - we're gonna grab the coins rotation
05:41 - degrees create a track for that then go
05:44 - all the way to the end now we're going
05:47 - to set it to 180 rotating around Y and
05:51 - since since the going to symmetrical we
05:54 - don't have to rotate a full 360 you
05:56 - wrote rotate 180 keyframe that set it to
06:00 - loop and hit play now we have our coin
06:05 - spinning set this to auto play and we
06:11 - should be good to go go back over to our
06:13 - world where I've spawned a few more of
06:16 - them and there we go nice spinning coins
06:23 - for us to go and collect
06:28 - okay for this next part I've made
06:30 - another new area node and this is gonna
06:34 - be our bullet for the mesh instance this
06:36 - time I used a capsule shape and weight
06:39 - ahead and made it just set the radius to
06:42 - 0.1 and the height to 0.3 and then
06:46 - that'll give us a good size for what our
06:48 - character will be shooting and you can
06:51 - make a collision shape that's also a
06:52 - capsule shape that matches the exact
06:55 - same dimensions and I also went and just
06:59 - put a little material on there to make
07:01 - the bullet look like I'm firing a red
07:03 - laser beam or something and then I've
07:06 - also added a timer timer is gonna be for
07:09 - the bullets lifetime so that we can make
07:12 - the bullets disappear after a certain
07:13 - amount of time and I've set the one-shot
07:15 - and the auto start on alright we're
07:20 - going to add a script to this bullet and
07:23 - what this is gonna do is have a speed
07:27 - variable we're gonna set that to 15 and
07:30 - of course it's velocity is going to be
07:34 - some vector three and then we're gonna
07:38 - make a start function and the start
07:41 - function we're gonna pass it a transform
07:46 - usually this will probably be the
07:48 - transform of the player so transform set
07:53 - the transform of the bullet itself equal
07:55 - to that transform that got passed in and
07:57 - set the velocity equal to the forward
08:01 - vector which is transform basis Z times
08:06 - the speed and then process is just going
08:10 - to move this area so we take our origin
08:13 - of our transform and we add velocity
08:17 - times Delta and then finally we need to
08:22 - connect the timer's timeout signal and
08:28 - if that happens we're gonna delete the
08:32 - bullet and also we want to say if the
08:37 - bullet contacts something we're going to
08:40 - have it disappear like for example
08:42 - the only things we really have in our
08:44 - world right now are the platforms but if
08:46 - it it's one of those static bodies so
08:48 - we're gonna say body entered on the
08:52 - bullets we're going to connect to that
08:55 - and just for now let's just say if body
09:00 - is static body Q free so that's the code
09:08 - for our bullet itself now we need to
09:11 - make the player spawn these when we
09:14 - press shoot okay here we are at our
09:17 - player scene and I'm going to add a
09:20 - position 3d and what this does is allows
09:23 - us to mark the position where we want
09:26 - our bullets to spawn and I'm going to
09:30 - have them come out of the end of the
09:33 - triangle here and you can you could even
09:38 - orient it so that they go up or down or
09:40 - something like that but that's going to
09:43 - be the spot where the bullet is going to
09:45 - appear so save that and then in the code
09:52 - that's the that's how we're gonna find
09:55 - the transform4 what we pass to the
09:56 - bullet so first we need to load the
09:59 - bullet up here so so we're going to load
10:06 - the bullet scene which if you want a
10:11 - shortcut to typing paths you can always
10:13 - go over here and grab bullet scene and
10:15 - just drag it there and it will drop the
10:18 - path in there for you so we're going to
10:21 - use the left mouse button so let's go to
10:24 - project settings and in our input map
10:27 - we're going to add a shoot action and
10:31 - we're going to attach the mouse button
10:35 - left button then we can go down to our
10:39 - unhandled input here and we can add if
10:45 - the event is action pressed shoot so we
10:55 - press that shoot button then we're gonna
10:57 - spawn a new bullet an instance of the
11:03 - bullet we're going to call it start
11:06 - method like some black room here using
11:10 - the position 3d global transform so we
11:16 - want to use the transform of that so it
11:19 - will automatically be pointing in the
11:21 - same direction that the player is and
11:25 - then we're going to just add this to the
11:33 - parent scene and normally I would get a
11:36 - little bit more flexible with this but
11:38 - for this demo we can just add this to
11:41 - the parent so let's go over to our scene
11:45 - and run it again
11:53 - alright one more area object for us to
11:55 - make the spikes so i've instanced the
11:58 - spikes object turned it into an area and
12:01 - added a collision shape by using Create
12:06 - convex collision sibling so you can see
12:09 - it made a collision shape there so we
12:11 - can tell when our player touches this
12:13 - object and so this object is just going
12:17 - to detect whether something ran into it
12:20 - so let's create a script and we're going
12:25 - to connect the body entered signal and
12:29 - when the body entered signal is
12:32 - triggered we want to if body has method
12:40 - take damage
12:43 - then we're gonna asset tell the body to
12:46 - take damage and now we can go over to
12:53 - our character and define what that
12:58 - so I'm gonna add a you know we want a
13:02 - little bit of a response something to
13:04 - happen to the player when they step on
13:06 - the spikes I want them to bounce away
13:09 - from it and in order to do that if we're
13:11 - holding down the movement key we try and
13:14 - bounce away we're gonna move right back
13:16 - into it so we're gonna add a can move
13:21 - variable that will just be a flag for us
13:24 - to disable movement for a brief amount
13:27 - of time while actually just start with
13:31 - it true while the player is executing
13:35 - that hurt movement and then they can
13:38 - start moving again on their own so can
13:41 - move is true and our take damage
13:44 - function will add that down here at the
13:46 - end and what that means is I want the
13:55 - velocity to be reversed which means
13:59 - you're going to fly backwards but
14:01 - specifically I want the velocity dot Y
14:04 - to equal the jump speed so it's also
14:06 - going to so it's gonna push this
14:08 - backwards but also upwards and then
14:11 - we're gonna set can move equal to false
14:14 - so now we will no longer be able to
14:19 - process input we're going to do this for
14:24 - a short amount of time so we're gonna
14:25 - use the get tree create timer method to
14:32 - give us a one off timer that lasts for
14:34 - one second and when that's done we'll
14:37 - set can move it back to true again and
14:41 - then to have that can move take effect
14:44 - we just have to go up here to get input
14:46 - and at the beginning we're set we're
14:48 - just gonna say if can move is false we
14:53 - will return and we won't won't process
14:54 - any input so that is it we just need to
14:58 - stick one of those spikes onto our level
15:00 - and try it out so let's put this up here
15:06 - in the corner
15:11 - yeah about right there let's see what
15:17 - happens when we go and run into those
15:19 - spikes Oh
15:24 - see how I'm knocked backwards now go
15:27 - sideways into it right makes me fly away
15:29 - and we could adjust the amount that it
15:35 - kicks you out words you could adjust all
15:37 - that kind of stuff but now we get at
15:39 - least an effect of something happening
15:41 - when we run into those I hope this was
15:44 - helpful for you please leave your
15:46 - questions in the comment section below
15:47 - and I'll see you in the next video
15:57 - you
