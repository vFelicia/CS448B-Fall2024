00:00 - in this episode of game development with
00:02 - pygame we're gonna continue with part
00:04 - three of our platformer game in this
00:07 - video we will learn how to add gravity
00:09 - and also some platforms that our player
00:12 - can land on in the last video we added
00:16 - our player sprite worked on the movement
00:19 - so we have a kind of a realistic
00:21 - movement with a little bit of inertia
00:23 - friction slowing us down when we let go
00:27 - of the key and we only did side-to-side
00:30 - movement because obviously for this
00:32 - we're gonna want to have downward
00:34 - movement be caused by gravity now
00:38 - gravity itself is gonna be really easy
00:39 - to do we just want an acceleration
00:44 - downwards now of course as soon as I add
00:46 - gravity we are going to fall off the
00:48 - bottom of the screen so we're gonna need
00:50 - to add some platforms pretty quick but
00:51 - let's go ahead and talk about how we do
00:53 - gravity so over in our player sprite we
00:58 - have in our update section so the part
01:02 - of the sprite that runs every frame of
01:04 - the animation we're setting the
01:06 - acceleration in the X direction and in
01:09 - the Y direction to zero so for gravity
01:12 - we want an acceleration in the Y
01:15 - Direction positive y-direction so we
01:20 - could put say zero point five here so
01:23 - every frame we will be accelerating
01:26 - downwards right so you want that to be
01:30 - an acceleration not a velocity because
01:32 - we don't follow that steady speed we
01:33 - accelerate that's what will look
01:35 - realistic okay so let's see what that
01:37 - looks like
01:39 - all right now you might notice I'll run
01:42 - it one more time
01:43 - I don't look like I'm accelerating I'm
01:46 - falling at a steady speed now can you
01:49 - guess why that is has to do with what we
01:52 - did last time remember when we added the
01:57 - friction so we actually have friction
01:59 - slowing us down and basically putting a
02:02 - maximum on our speed in the Y direction
02:04 - but we don't want that we want this
02:08 - friction to only apply in the
02:10 - x-direction so we're gonna have just the
02:12 - acceleration
02:13 - x-direction affected by friction and
02:17 - that will make gravity work a little
02:19 - more like we expect it to there see I
02:23 - fell off the bottom of the screen okay
02:27 - so before we can do even begin to talk
02:30 - about jumping we're going to need to
02:32 - have some platforms to land on all right
02:36 - eventually we're gonna want to have
02:37 - multiple platforms but to start with we
02:40 - need to put something that we can land
02:42 - on at the bottom of the screen there
02:44 - like the ground of our world so I'm
02:47 - gonna hide my player class for the
02:48 - moment and we're gonna jump down here to
02:51 - the bottom and we're gonna add a class
02:54 - platform now platforms are going to be
02:58 - pretty simple at least to start with
03:03 - because all we really want them to do my
03:07 - underscores there all we really need is
03:10 - when we spawn a new platform we're gonna
03:13 - want to specify where on the screen it
03:15 - is so we're gonna give it an X and a y
03:17 - and we're gonna give it a width and a
03:20 - height for how big we want that platform
03:22 - to be so every time we make a new
03:24 - platform we give it an X and y location
03:28 - and a width and a height so so what
03:33 - we're gonna do is first we're gonna
03:38 - create the image and that's going to be
03:44 - a surface using the width and height I'm
03:51 - gonna just use green for my color so
03:57 - I'll fill the image with and then the
03:58 - rect and we just want to place the
04:04 - rectangle at the at the X&Y we specified
04:10 - okay and that is our entire platform
04:14 - class that's all we need to make the
04:16 - platform work so if we come over to our
04:21 - main and we go to
04:26 - our new we're going to be able to spawn
04:29 - a platform but I'm also while I'm here
04:35 - going to add a platforms group to hold
04:41 - all the platforms so that we can do
04:43 - collisions just like we did in the
04:45 - shmoop where we had all of our mobs and
04:48 - one group to do the occlusion very
04:51 - easily so so we're gonna spawn a
04:54 - platform we're gonna add it to the
04:55 - sprites and to the platforms now to
04:58 - start with I'm just going to manually
04:59 - spawn one okay and this is going to be a
05:02 - platform and remember we need to give it
05:05 - the X Y width and height so I want this
05:07 - to be at the bottom so the X to be zero
05:09 - I want the Y to be eight minus 40 so a
05:15 - little bit up from the bottom
05:16 - I want the width to be the same as the
05:19 - width of the screen and I want the
05:21 - height to be 40 pixels and then I'm
05:26 - gonna do go ahead and add it to the
05:34 - group's so it'll be ready to work with
05:39 - our clave notes so that should give us a
05:43 - platform down here at the bottom 40
05:46 - pixels tall with the width of the window
05:50 - wide now we're ready to start talking
05:56 - about collisions so if we go over here
05:58 - and look at our player sprite remember
06:01 - we have our acceleration our velocity
06:04 - and our position right and those are
06:07 - being calculated using those equations
06:08 - of motion at the end of all that
06:11 - calculation we have whatever our
06:13 - position of our sprite should be and
06:15 - we're using that position variable to
06:18 - set the center of our players rectangle
06:23 - so it puts the sprite wherever the
06:25 - position has been calculated that it
06:26 - should be and that's okay and it works
06:29 - fine but it is does mean that if we look
06:32 - at this diagram that I drew
06:37 - that we are gonna have to do a few other
06:40 - things so if here's our yellow player
06:43 - sprite you know when the player sprite
06:45 - falls and hits the platform we want to
06:49 - put the bottom of the player against the
06:52 - top of the platform alright but that
06:56 - means that we want to put the players Y
07:00 - position we want to put this dot this
07:04 - far above the top of the roof of the
07:08 - platform so we're gonna have to use some
07:10 - sort of formula like this where the Y
07:13 - position of the player is equal to the
07:15 - top of the platform minus half the
07:18 - height of the player and that's kind of
07:21 - cumbersome and it really doesn't make a
07:23 - whole lot of sense to track the center
07:25 - since most of the time when we're
07:26 - standing on things we're talking about
07:28 - the feet of the player so we might as
07:30 - well do it like this so instead of using
07:33 - that center position we're going to use
07:35 - this position of the rectangle which is
07:37 - called the mid bottom so all we have to
07:40 - do when we collided with a platform it
07:42 - set the players Y position equal to the
07:45 - top of the rectangle of the rectangle of
07:48 - the platform and that is a lot clearer
07:50 - and simpler and we don't have to deal
07:52 - with all those height over two problems
07:55 - so all we have to do to change that is
07:58 - just go right here and set this to mid
08:01 - bottom so now our position calculated
08:05 - position will always be the mid bottom
08:06 - of the player and then we're ready to
08:09 - start trying the collisions so if we go
08:13 - over here to our update section of our
08:15 - game loop we're just going to do a
08:17 - collision check we're gonna do the
08:21 - collision check between the player and
08:27 - the platforms and we're gonna put false
08:34 - remember that tells you whether or not
08:36 - to delete the item you ran into and we
08:39 - don't want to delete the platform's when
08:40 - you run into them so if we hit something
08:44 - then we want to take this the player's Y
08:48 - position and set it
08:51 - equal to whatever we hit it stopped and
08:58 - you might think that that would be
08:59 - enough but something weird is going to
09:01 - happen I'm gonna fall and you see how I
09:04 - fall through the platform I'll run out
09:07 - one more time so you can see it sort of
09:10 - sink through there why does that happen
09:13 - well if you think about what's happening
09:16 - remember we have our our velocity and
09:19 - our acceleration are continuing to be
09:21 - calculated right and because we keep
09:23 - accelerating we have this acceleration
09:25 - so when we hit that when we hit that
09:28 - platform our velocity is not zero our
09:31 - velocity is some number greater than
09:34 - zero because we're falling and even
09:36 - though we stopped the rectangle and put
09:39 - it at the top we didn't set our velocity
09:43 - to 0 sorry velocity is going to continue
09:44 - to grow because of the acceleration so
09:48 - our velocity keeps getting bigger and
09:49 - bigger
09:49 - so we've keep moving even though we've
09:51 - said to stop so we need to make sure we
09:54 - also tell the set the players Y velocity
09:58 - equal to zero that way we can fall and
10:04 - stop moving and we can run along the
10:09 - platform but we don't fall through it so
10:16 - I know the last couple of videos have
10:17 - been kind of long and we're always I
10:19 - always try to keep them around 10
10:21 - minutes and we've just crossed the 10
10:23 - minute mark now so just one other thing
10:26 - that I wanted to do was I'm gonna add
10:29 - one more platform just so that we have
10:31 - something else to look at okay
10:33 - and so this platform is going to be I'm
10:38 - gonna put it with over to say minus 52
10:43 - so it's not right at the center I'm
10:46 - gonna put the Y at height times 3 over 4
10:51 - 3 quarters of the way and I'm gonna put
10:56 - the width to 100 and the height to say
10:58 - 20 ok now you can see I have to add
11:04 - to get to the groups and in an upcoming
11:08 - video we'll talk about a cleaner way to
11:10 - do this so we don't have to keep doing
11:12 - all that repeating all of this added to
11:14 - the group out of the group and and we're
11:16 - not gonna manually create a whole bunch
11:18 - of platforms but just for now just have
11:19 - a second one it's okay to do it
11:21 - temporarily so I just wanted to show you
11:23 - that if we had if we had dot adhere if
11:30 - we had two platforms on the screen then
11:33 - C will land on the one we hit and if I
11:35 - walk off the side I'll fall through it
11:37 - just so you see how it works with the
11:40 - platforms okay and I will stop it there
11:44 - so you can experiment with your gravity
11:47 - you can make your gravity lower or
11:49 - higher right go in and change this 0.5
11:53 - right here if you make that number
11:56 - bigger you're gonna fall faster right
12:00 - you have a stronger gravity and if you
12:04 - make it lower you can pretend like
12:06 - you're on the moon and fall slower so in
12:10 - the next video we'll actually get
12:13 - started having jumping alright thanks
12:16 - for watching
12:24 - you
