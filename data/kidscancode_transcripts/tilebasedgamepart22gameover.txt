00:01 - hello everyone and welcome back to game
00:03 - development with PI game this is part 22
00:05 - of our top-down zombie shooter and in
00:09 - this video we're going to be adding the
00:11 - game over condition as well as fixing a
00:14 - couple of very minor issues that we need
00:18 - to take care of all right so let's get
00:19 - started okay we're going to start off
00:22 - with a couple of small things one is if
00:26 - you've noticed when we when we run this
00:29 - you know we added that nice little splat
00:32 - sound when we defeat the zombie right
00:36 - but the problem is if I then go and die
00:42 - the game starts over again right that
00:46 - splat is still there
00:48 - alright so each time I restart and the
00:53 - problem is because there that's
00:54 - happening because when we we're creating
00:57 - our map right here when we when we first
01:03 - start the game when we load all our data
01:04 - we make our map right here and we make
01:06 - our map image and that map image is what
01:08 - we're drawing the little splats on and
01:12 - so when we restart we're still using
01:14 - that image that has the splats drawn on
01:15 - it so all we want to do to fix this is
01:18 - we're going to take this code right here
01:21 - that loads the map and we're going to
01:23 - put it in def new here so that way
01:26 - whenever we start a new game we start
01:30 - with the level 1 map ok and then that
01:35 - way we can oops oh the map folder we
01:40 - need to define our map folder here dot
01:46 - map folder and load our tab map from
01:51 - that and that way we'll be able to load
01:54 - other maps when we get to other levels
01:57 - and that's better now
02:00 - she's this guy and then go and let him
02:04 - know me right now it's a clean map when
02:11 - I start okay that was a little one we'd
02:15 - also like to do a couple other things
02:18 - which is we want to keep track of how
02:22 - many zombies are left because that's
02:24 - going to be our level complete condition
02:28 - is you've cleaned out the map and you've
02:30 - killed all the zombies so we just want
02:33 - to be able to display on the screen how
02:35 - many zombies are left so I have added
02:37 - here so we had our title font which is
02:41 - what we did our paws menu in and stuff
02:45 - this HUD font is going to be for our
02:47 - heads up display for displaying any
02:50 - information the font I picked out of the
02:55 - font folder I had with a bunch of
02:57 - different stuff in it and you can
02:59 - download it in the link below so we just
03:01 - want to draw the number of zombies on
03:04 - the screen in our draw section so we're
03:08 - going to go down there and we're going
03:10 - to say here after we draw the help we
03:17 - can draw text and what we want to say is
03:20 - the word zombies it's free : and the the
03:32 - value here is just going to be the
03:33 - length of the mobs group okay and then
03:38 - we're going to use the HUD font we're
03:43 - going to size it at around 30 we'll do
03:48 - it in white and I'm going to put it in
03:53 - the upper right hand corner so I'm going
03:55 - to put it at with minus 10 and the y is
03:58 - going to be 10 and we're going to line
04:00 - it northeast okay
04:03 - so let's wrap this around a little bit
04:06 - so it's not so long on the screen there
04:15 - all right and my indenting let's back up
04:22 - the space here there okay
04:24 - so there we go so now I can see how many
04:27 - zombies I have and when I kill one
04:32 - that's going to go down right okay now
04:36 - what should happen when I've killed the
04:37 - last zombie well we already have
04:42 - everything in place for that we just
04:44 - need to trigger it so here in our update
04:46 - we're going to define the GAMEOVER
04:50 - condition and that's just going to be if
04:53 - the length of the mobs group is zero
04:59 - then playing equals false okay if
05:03 - playing equals false then our game loop
05:07 - is going to end all right which is the
05:10 - run function and if the run function
05:12 - ends we will show the game over screen
05:15 - and when the game over screen exits
05:17 - we will loop around and show the new
05:22 - screen or unload the new game and run in
05:24 - a game so we just need to define what we
05:27 - want to do in here in the game over
05:29 - screen well there's a couple things we
05:31 - want to do we want to show some
05:32 - information and we want to wait for the
05:36 - player to press the key so that they can
05:38 - play again okay so I'm just going to
05:44 - fill the screen with black we can make
05:47 - it look fancier later on and we're going
05:51 - to need to draw a couple of things all
05:55 - right so we're going to draw text what
05:57 - we're going to draw is game game over
06:01 - we're going to use the title font we're
06:10 - going to make it big or do it in red I'm
06:17 - going to Center it and I'm going to
06:22 - align it center
06:27 - all right let's do this easy to read and
06:37 - then we also we also want to draw text
06:44 - and say press a key we're also going to
06:52 - use the title font the size we're going
06:58 - to make a bit smaller I'm going to do
07:03 - the color in white I'm going to also
07:08 - Center it in X but in Y I'm going to put
07:12 - it at height times 3/4 so it's 3/4 of
07:16 - the way from the top and we're going to
07:19 - Center that as well all right that looks
07:25 - good my - I want it right there okay so
07:32 - now draw those two things on the screen
07:39 - we need to flip the display so we can
07:41 - see it and then we need to wait for a
07:43 - key to get pressed
07:44 - now this is something that I probably am
07:47 - going to want to do on the Start screen
07:48 - as well so I'm just going to define it
07:51 - as a function that we can call anytime
07:54 - we want to just say wait for a key to
07:56 - get pressed okay and then we will define
08:02 - it here now what is it going to do well
08:05 - it's going to have a little loop here so
08:08 - we're going to make a loop called
08:10 - waiting and as long as that is true
08:15 - we're just going to sit here doing
08:17 - nothing so we need to tick the clock so
08:21 - we keep our loop running at a reasonable
08:25 - speed and then we need to check for
08:28 - events and there's two events we could
08:35 - deal with the
08:39 - event right we still want people to be
08:41 - able to X out so we've set weighting
08:44 - equal to false to end this loop where N
08:47 - and we in do these and we do the quit
08:50 - function but otherwise the type of event
08:58 - we care about is a key up event and I
09:02 - think I talked about this earlier in the
09:04 - if you watch the video on the
09:06 - platforming game we want to do a key up
09:08 - event not a key down event that way when
09:11 - the player taps the key we trigger on
09:14 - them letting go of it not on them
09:16 - holding it down otherwise we would start
09:18 - a new game and they already have the key
09:19 - press down which can sometimes make
09:22 - things happen that they don't expect and
09:25 - so this way there we go all right let's
09:30 - see how this goes all right so we'll run
09:35 - it here and we need to run over here and
09:38 - die and oops typo self dot screen all
09:49 - right there we go
09:54 - game over press a key I restart okay now
09:59 - one thing that's going to happen I'm
10:02 - going to hold the arrow key down while
10:03 - I'm running around so that I will be
10:06 - continuing to hold it down when I die
10:08 - okay so I'm still holding it down you
10:10 - see when I let go it restarted even
10:14 - though I might have been letting go
10:16 - because the game ended I haven't even
10:18 - had a chance to look at the game over
10:22 - screen yet so what we can do is just add
10:27 - PG event wait here okay
10:31 - and what that's going to do is it's
10:33 - basically going to clear out it's going
10:37 - to pull out any event that happens at
10:38 - the beginning of this and basically
10:42 - start with a fresh event queue so that
10:46 - when we hold the key down we won't have
10:49 - that problem okay so I'm going to hold
10:51 - the forward key down I'm still
10:53 - holding it down and when I let go see
10:55 - nothing happened but if I tap it again
10:58 - then we get answer that will prevent
11:00 - that little problem from happening all
11:04 - right and the last one little change
11:07 - that we need to make is right now our
11:11 - bullets our bullets are only doing
11:15 - damage depending on what weapon the
11:19 - player is holding right and right now
11:22 - that means if I shoot a bunch of pistol
11:25 - bullets and while the bullet is in the
11:28 - air from the pistol bullet is in the air
11:32 - flying towards the target before it hits
11:35 - the target I pick up the shotgun then
11:38 - when the bullet hits the target it will
11:40 - do a shotgun damage instead of pistol
11:43 - damage even though it was a pistol
11:44 - bullet that I fired and so we need to
11:47 - correct that so what we need to do is in
11:50 - our sprites in our bullet sprite we need
11:54 - to add a damage per bullet so when we
12:00 - spawn the bullet we're just going to
12:02 - pass in what the damage is okay and
12:05 - we'll just store that as a class
12:07 - variable oak damage equals damage and
12:12 - then when we spawn the bullet which is
12:15 - up here in Def shoot right that's where
12:19 - we spawn the bullet then what we want to
12:22 - do is just pass that weapon damage at
12:26 - that time so when we spawn the bullet we
12:30 - add here we want to pass from the
12:34 - weapons dictionary
12:35 - whichever weapon we're holding the
12:40 - damage value all right now that will
12:43 - work though should run now and not give
12:45 - us any error messages I switch to one
12:48 - here right but now we need to actually
12:53 - subtract the bullets damage from the mob
12:57 - when we hit it next right now we're
13:00 - again subtracting the weapon damage so
13:06 - here we go when the bullet hits the mob
13:09 - right we don't want to just subtract the
13:12 - weapon damage we want to subtract the
13:14 - bullets damage which might be which will
13:19 - be assigned to it right so here we need
13:21 - to say so we're not going to do this I'm
13:24 - just going to comment that out so you
13:27 - can see where we are now especially when
13:32 - we're finding the shotgun there's a lot
13:33 - of bullets in the air right and right
13:36 - now what we're doing is we're saying
13:39 - we're getting a list this hits list is a
13:42 - list of the mobs that were hit right and
13:49 - for each of those mobs there might be
13:51 - multiple bullets hitting them so we need
13:54 - two for each mob look at which things
14:01 - hit that and for each of those we
14:05 - subtract the mobs
14:07 - from the mobs health the bullets damage
14:10 - okay and maybe I'll make it totally
14:16 - clear here and call this bullet instead
14:18 - of B that's not clear okay so and in
14:27 - fact why don't we name this mob just to
14:30 - be completely clear for each mob in the
14:32 - hits dictionary we want to take the mobs
14:38 - health and we want to take the mobs boss
14:45 - okay all right so hopefully that's clear
14:48 - so for each Bob that we hit we're going
14:50 - to go through each bullet they hit that
14:51 - mob and subtract that bullets damaged
14:55 - and and then like we did before is that
14:57 - the mobs velocity to zero so you
15:00 - shouldn't see much in the way of
15:01 - difference as far as how it works now
15:03 - but at least when we switch weapons and
15:07 - we have you know the all the shotgun
15:12 - bullets flying out everything they're
15:14 - going to keep their bare damage when
15:16 - they hit about whatever mod they hit
15:19 - you
15:26 - you
