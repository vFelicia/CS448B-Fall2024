00:00 - welcome to learning to code with Python
00:02 - lesson 4
00:03 - today we're going to talk about loops
00:05 - and do a little bit more drawing with
00:07 - turtles okay for this lesson let's get
00:12 - back to Fred the turtle so I'm going to
00:14 - import my turtle and create the turtle
00:18 - window alright and remember how we
00:27 - changed Fred's shape I'm going to do
00:30 - that again - okay so let's say with Fred
00:36 - we wanted to draw a square what would we
00:39 - need to do what are the steps well we
00:42 - need to go forward a certain amount
00:43 - let's call it 100 then we need to turn
00:47 - to our left 90 degrees right and then we
00:52 - need to do that same thing again for
00:57 - that side of the square turn left and
01:06 - left and there we go we drew a square if
01:17 - that was a lot of typing to do just to
01:19 - draw a square and if you noticed we were
01:21 - typing the same thing a bunch of times
01:23 - weren't we we had to type forward and
01:26 - left forward and left forward and left
01:29 - we're doing the same thing over and over
01:31 - and actually if we wanted to get back to
01:33 - the exact same place we started we
01:35 - should put another left here if there's
01:39 - one thing that programmers hate it's
01:40 - having to type the same thing over and
01:42 - over again computers on the other hand
01:44 - can't get tired or bored so there must
01:47 - be a better way the better way is to use
01:49 - something called a loop a loop is a way
01:51 - to tell the computer to repeat some
01:53 - commands over and over in this case we
01:56 - want the computer to repeat these two
01:58 - commands forward and left and we want it
02:01 - to repeat them four times one two three
02:05 - four so we want what's called a counting
02:08 - loop we want the computer to count to
02:10 - four and each time it counts droop
02:13 - these commands here's what a counting
02:16 - loop looks like first let's do reset so
02:22 - that we don't have our square we already
02:24 - drew there and now let's type the loop
02:26 - we're going to say for I in range for
02:35 - what this command means is I want you to
02:39 - count to four that's what range four
02:41 - does and for each number which we're
02:45 - going to use I to stand for the number
02:46 - for each number in that range of four I
02:49 - want you to do something and this colon
02:52 - tells the computer some commands are
02:53 - going to come after this the commands
02:55 - that come after that colon are the ones
02:56 - that you're going to repeat so I'm going
02:58 - to press enter and notice it didn't do
03:01 - anything yet it's waiting for me to type
03:02 - what commands it wants to repeat so
03:05 - we're going to say Fred dot forward 100
03:08 - Fred left 90 and then we're going to
03:13 - press ENTER and notice it's waiting for
03:15 - me to type a third command if there was
03:17 - a third command I wanted to repeat but
03:18 - there isn't so I'm going to press ENTER
03:20 - one more time and there we go we have a
03:24 - square and that's what a counting loop
03:27 - looks like now I want you to notice a
03:29 - couple of things about how this loop
03:31 - looks notice that the two commands that
03:34 - we wanted to repeat see how they're
03:36 - indented there's space here they're not
03:40 - lined up with the F in for in Python
03:43 - that space that indenting tells the
03:46 - computer that these commands aren't by
03:49 - themselves they belong to this loop
03:52 - they're part of it there are the things
03:54 - that the loop after the colon is looking
03:56 - for that it wants to repeat so what
04:00 - we've done is we've taken these eight
04:02 - commands that we had to type to draw a
04:04 - square and we've turned it into only
04:07 - three that's a lot less typing but watch
04:11 - what else you can do with loops let's
04:13 - erase that and let's say that this time
04:16 - I want you to count to eight and then
04:22 - each time you're going to go forward
04:26 - 100 and you're going to turn left 225
04:31 - degrees what do you think that's going
04:33 - to draw well let's look if we did those
04:43 - one at a time that would have taken 16
04:46 - separate commands so let's look a little
04:48 - more closely at what's going on inside
04:50 - of one of these counting loops you
04:56 - remember we have this letter I hear this
04:59 - I is actually a variable and each time
05:02 - we go through the loop I is being set
05:04 - equal to the number that we're currently
05:06 - counting so what if I count to five in
05:10 - each time I just print out what I is see
05:16 - and don't forget we always start
05:18 - counting at zero right so I was equal to
05:21 - zero the first time through the loop the
05:24 - second time through the loop it was
05:25 - equal to one and so on so to count to
05:29 - five
05:30 - or to run the loop five times we counted
05:33 - zero one two three four so what this
05:37 - means is we can use that letter I the
05:39 - variable that's keeping track of the
05:42 - counting through our loop we can use it
05:44 - in our loop so let's reset and let's try
05:48 - an example so let's say we're going to
05:51 - count to 20 and then each time through
05:55 - we're going to go forward not a certain
05:58 - amount but ten times I so that means the
06:02 - first time through the loop we're going
06:03 - to go ten times zero then the second
06:05 - time ten times one then ten times two
06:08 - and so on and then in between each one
06:11 - we'll turn left 90 so it kind of looks
06:14 - like the square except every side is not
06:16 - going to be the same size so let's look
06:18 - what that does
06:27 - this is a good time to talk about how
06:30 - fast or in this case have slow fred
06:32 - draws you saw how long it took to draw
06:34 - that well there is a command called
06:37 - speed that will let you tell Fred to go
06:39 - faster this number can be anything from
06:41 - 1 to 10 with 10 being the fastest or you
06:46 - can use my favorite which is 0 which
06:48 - basically just says don't animate Fred
06:51 - moving at all just draw the thing I told
06:53 - you to draw and for this next example
06:55 - that's what I'm going to use ok
06:57 - so first let's reset and then we'll set
07:03 - the speed to 0 and now for this example
07:07 - I'm going to count to 50 and each time
07:13 - I'm going to draw a circle and that
07:16 - circle is going to be I times 3 and
07:18 - radius and then in between each circle
07:22 - I'm going to turn left
07:23 - just 10 degrees now watch what this
07:27 - draws pretty neat huh so you can do some
07:33 - pretty amazing stuff with loops let's
07:37 - see a few more examples unfortunately
07:41 - after you reset you do have to set the
07:43 - speed again ok let's try this one and
07:49 - before we draw this time let's add a
07:51 - little color and I'm going to make the
07:57 - line a little bit thicker so it'll be
08:00 - easier to see ok so we're going to count
08:03 - to 20 and then we're going to draw a
08:09 - circle I times 3 but this time we're
08:14 - going to put another thing in the
08:15 - parenthesis 180 and when you draw a
08:18 - circle the first number is how big the
08:21 - circle is going to be just like we've
08:23 - done before but then you can put a comma
08:25 - and then how much of the circle to draw
08:27 - so 180 degrees is half a circle so we're
08:30 - going to be drawing half circles and
08:33 - then we're going to turn right 45
08:35 - degrees okay
08:43 - one and this next one I'm going to show
08:45 - you are both shapes that were invented
08:47 - by students who have taken my class
08:49 - before we like to call this one the Rose
08:52 - so let's reset we'll set our speed back
08:56 - up to zero and this time how about we do
09:01 - green and we'll set the width again so
09:07 - it's a nice fat line to draw with
09:09 - okay so we're going to count to 100 and
09:16 - then we're going to go forward
09:18 - oops forward I times two we're going to
09:23 - draw a circle I times two but only
09:27 - ninety degrees of it which is a quarter
09:30 - circle and then we're going to turn
09:32 - right twenty degrees remember this was
09:36 - actually discovered by a student just
09:37 - experimenting and trying different
09:39 - things let's see what that looks like
09:48 - pretty cool so now it's your turn
09:51 - see what you can draw try different
09:54 - things put different commands in the
09:55 - loop change the numbers around
09:57 - experiment see what you can make and
10:00 - I'll see you in the next lesson
10:09 - you
