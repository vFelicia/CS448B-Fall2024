00:00 - all right welcome back this is part 23
00:03 - of our top down zombie game and in this
00:06 - episode we're going to add a lighting
00:08 - effect to the
00:09 - game so for this video I thought we'd
00:11 - talk a little bit about doing lighting
00:13 - effects uh this is being a zombie action
00:16 - game it might be nice to be able to have
00:19 - the character running around at night
00:21 - and maybe the zombies are a little
00:22 - harder to see uh something like I did a
00:25 - quick Google image search you know
00:27 - something like this where around where
00:29 - the player is it's lighter and in other
00:32 - parts of the map it's darker right we we
00:34 - we probably want to do a little bit
00:35 - darker than this but you get the
00:37 - idea now there's a lot of different ways
00:39 - to do this
00:42 - um most of the kind of more advanced
00:46 - ones are beyond the capabilities of what
00:50 - you can do in in pi game so we're going
00:52 - to stick to a really simple version of
00:55 - this kind of the most basic version um
00:58 - for this for this uh
01:01 - demonstration so what we're going to do
01:04 - is we're going to
01:07 - need basically to take our game and I'll
01:09 - load it up
01:11 - here and we want to draw basically over
01:14 - the top with a dark
01:18 - color and only have it be transparent or
01:22 - be able to see through it you know in a
01:24 - radius around the
01:27 - player and to do that that we're going
01:31 - to need an image and here's the image so
01:36 - all this is is a gradient where I went
01:40 - into but you can do this in pretty
01:43 - much any image editor you might use
01:46 - paint.net can do it they all have the
01:48 - gradient tool and all I did was select
01:52 - white and as my uh foreground color and
01:56 - transparent as my background color and
01:59 - then I just did a a
02:00 - radial gradient that goes from brightest
02:04 - white at the center and Fades out into
02:06 - transparency so this is going to be the
02:10 - the mask for our light we were going to
02:13 - we're going to place this at the center
02:14 - of where the player is and we're going
02:17 - to use that to sort of
02:19 - be reverse this effect and make this be
02:22 - where we can see everything at full
02:23 - brightness and it'll Fade Into Darkness
02:26 - as it gets here and then everything out
02:28 - outside of this image on the map will be
02:31 - all the way dark okay so we're just
02:33 - going to load that image here in our
02:34 - settings call it the light mask and you
02:38 - can go and make your own or I'll put the
02:40 - link to download the the light mask
02:43 - image in the description below if you
02:45 - want to just go ahead and grab this one
02:47 - that I'm
02:48 - using so let's just go and load that up
02:51 - now so over here in our loading code is
02:54 - where we want to do that but also first
02:56 - I just want to show you real quick I
02:58 - added here in
03:00 - our uh new game code another of these
03:05 - Boolean Flags called
03:07 - night and that's just so that we'll be
03:10 - able to turn on and off the lighting
03:12 - effect and down here in the event code I
03:17 - just added pressing the N key is going
03:19 - to toggle that night
03:21 - mode right so that way we'll be able to
03:24 - test it well and see how it looks right
03:26 - so back up here in our in all of our
03:28 - asset loading do this right before we
03:30 - load the
03:32 - sounds we need two images One image is
03:36 - going to be that
03:38 - solid giant black rectangle that's going
03:40 - to cover the whole screen
03:43 - and if you've ever
03:46 - played a like a military strategy game
03:50 - that had a fog of War it's what it's
03:52 - usually called the fog of war the the
03:55 - part that darkens the areas you can't
03:56 - see so we're just going to call that fog
04:00 - um and that's just going to be a pame
04:03 - surface that's the same
04:07 - size as the screen because it's going to
04:10 - cover the whole
04:11 - screen and then we want to fill
04:16 - that with that night color that dark
04:19 - gray that we chose in our
04:22 - settings and then we need to load the
04:25 - that light mask and the light mask we're
04:28 - just going to do a
04:30 - PG image. load so I'm just going to grab
04:33 - this one right
04:36 - here and the thing we're going to load
04:39 - is
04:41 - the light
04:43 - mask and we also want to uh resize
04:50 - this so that we'll be able to adjust its
04:53 - size right so we're going to scale
04:57 - this by the
05:01 - light radius setting we set as
05:04 - well and then the last thing we need is
05:07 - we're going to need a
05:09 - rectangle so that we can easily place
05:12 - this where we want it to
05:16 - beang all right so now we got everything
05:18 - loaded that we need so now to draw this
05:21 - what we have to do is take this light
05:25 - mask and blend it onto the fog at the
05:29 - location of the player and then take the
05:32 - whole fog
05:34 - and stick it on the screen on top of
05:37 - everything else which means we want to
05:38 - draw it towards the end so we got our
05:42 - draw section we want to draw it after
05:43 - we've drawn all the Sprites and
05:45 - everything but probably
05:47 - before uh we draw our Huds so that we
05:49 - can still see
05:51 - things so we're going to do that
05:55 - here so
05:57 - if Knight is true
06:01 - we're going to render the
06:04 - fog okay and so let's just Define what
06:08 - that process is so render
06:14 - fog needs to do a couple of things right
06:17 - we need to um we need to draw the light
06:25 - mask which is a
06:28 - gradient on to
06:31 - the fog image right now every frame
06:35 - we're going to have to do this because
06:37 - the player moving around so last frame
06:40 - we will drawn the light mask onto the
06:43 - fog so we need to um take the fog and
06:47 - fill it
06:47 - again with our night
06:52 - color and then we need to take figure
06:54 - out where
06:57 - our um circle of light needs to go
07:00 - so we'll take our light
07:03 - re.
07:05 - Center and we'll set it equal to the
07:09 - location of the
07:11 - player right which is we got to apply
07:13 - the camera to the
07:18 - player which gets us erect and we'll use
07:21 - that Center of
07:23 - that okay then onto the fog we're going
07:26 - to
07:27 - blit the light image
07:36 - oh sorry the light mask I mean we're
07:37 - going to spit that at the location okay
07:42 - so now we have our fog image and it's
07:45 - going to be a big dark gray
07:49 - rectangle with a light
07:52 - white uh gradient Circle somewhere right
07:55 - so it's going to look kind of a lot like
07:57 - this now the back it'll be dark but this
08:00 - is what it's going to look like and if
08:01 - we just draw that on the screen we'll
08:03 - see a big white circle on top of our
08:06 - player so what we want to do is when we
08:09 - draw this on the
08:13 - screen right when we lit that fog image
08:16 - onto the screen right we're going to put
08:18 - it at z z because it's going to cover
08:20 - the whole screen so it's going to start
08:21 - in the upper left hand
08:23 - corner we want to
08:26 - use something called a blend mode and
08:29 - and so pame has these special flags that
08:32 - go with um how you draw pixels on top of
08:37 - other
08:39 - pixels and we're going to use the blend
08:42 - multiply okay and that's going to take
08:46 - every pixel that we have on
08:49 - our on our fog
08:52 - image and look at the pixel that's going
08:54 - to be below it and it's going to
08:56 - multiply them together right and so
08:58 - where we're
09:00 - white like if you think of the pixels as
09:03 - being between zero and one right uh zero
09:06 - being black and one being white um and
09:10 - obviously that's for each of the colors
09:12 - let's say let's just to keep it simple
09:13 - let's just say we're doing a black and
09:14 - white picture then when the picture is
09:16 - white when the pixel is white it's one
09:19 - so it's going to take whatever is
09:21 - underneath it and multiply by one which
09:23 - doesn't change it right and if it were
09:25 - zero we'd be multiplying by zero which
09:27 - would make it black so that's basically
09:29 - going to going to combine those two
09:31 - images together the way we want so let's
09:34 - take a look at how it looks
09:38 - now right so here's our game here I'm
09:40 - running around now I'm going to press n
09:42 - and turn on the night effect and there
09:45 - we go now the screen is so dark right
09:48 - and BEC but because we aren't using pure
09:50 - black we're using that dark dark gray
09:53 - 20220 um you can see a little bit of the
09:56 - map back here behind you see a little
09:58 - bit of the screen as if it's not quite
10:02 - fully dark and then our light gradient
10:06 - kind of Blends out to here and it moves
10:08 - as I move
10:10 - around so now we have a much more
10:13 - challenging thing it's hard to see those
10:14 - zombies until they get in range
10:19 - right that's pretty good now you might
10:23 - notice that my frame rate rate up here
10:26 - at the top is um dropping quite a bit
10:29 - um and I did some testing this has
10:31 - something to do with my video recording
10:33 - um happening at the same time you
10:35 - shouldn't see a big frame rate drop like
10:37 - that uh when you're just splitting this
10:40 - black image on
10:43 - there but let me know in the comments
10:45 - below if you do there could be some
10:46 - other things going on uh as well but
10:50 - when I don't have the video recorder
10:51 - running it seems to work
10:54 - fine all right so that's the basics of
10:56 - it now there's a a lot of things you can
10:58 - do over here to make things come out
11:00 - differently right like for example if we
11:02 - wanted a much
11:05 - um less of a or a much lighter Darkness
11:09 - you know you make this 50 instead and
11:12 - then where it's going to blend
11:14 - to is a much lighter color right see at
11:19 - 50 now the darkness out here isn't
11:22 - nearly so dark and depending on what
11:26 - you're going for you know that might
11:28 - work better for you
11:30 - um I like it better when it's super
11:32 - dark change that back to 20 and another
11:36 - thing you can change you can obviously
11:37 - you can change the radius of how far
11:39 - your light
11:41 - shines but I've also made a couple other
11:44 - gradients right and remember this this
11:46 - gradient image is how quickly the you
11:49 - know or Blends from White in the center
11:51 - into the transparency but how quickly
11:55 - this this transition happens can have a
11:58 - lot of different effects effects on how
12:01 - your light effect looks and I've
12:04 - actually made three of them we've been
12:06 - using the medium one I made a hard and a
12:09 - soft edged version as well and I'll show
12:12 - you real quick what those look like
12:14 - right if we do the hard edged
12:18 - one then what's going to happen is we're
12:21 - going to have a
12:23 - much ster transition right it's much
12:26 - more of a just big bright CF ir and you
12:30 - don't have that fuzzy
12:33 - edge around it and it doesn't look quite
12:36 - as natural but again this could be an
12:39 - effect you're going
12:40 - after and then for the last one I'll
12:42 - show you what the soft edged one looks
12:49 - like right and what that one's going to
12:51 - do is blend you know much
12:56 - more you be much more fuzzy as it Blends
12:58 - into there right and so this looks much
13:00 - more like you have a really weak
13:01 - flashlight uh on
13:04 - you okay and you know that's pretty good
13:08 - you might scale it up a little bit make
13:11 - it go out a little bit further since
13:13 - it's uh running out so fast because you
13:15 - really can't see those zombies right now
13:17 - I can't even tell it's running at me
13:19 - until it gets really close right so that
13:21 - can be a much more
13:23 - challenging effect as
13:26 - well so that's our lighting effect now
13:29 - to wrap up let's talk a little bit about
13:31 - some of the limitations of
13:33 - this now obviously we have a a circle
13:36 - around the player right if you wanted it
13:39 - to look much more like the player had a
13:41 - flashlight then you would need more of a
13:44 - cone
13:45 - shaped uh gradient image and you'd have
13:48 - to rotate that as the player rotated
13:52 - which is you know quite a bit more work
13:55 - um I haven't tried that out too much
13:57 - with high game I suspect ECT it would
13:59 - hurt our frame rates a bit to have to
14:02 - try and do that every frame there might
14:04 - be some shortcuts we could come up with
14:05 - to speed it up but that would let you
14:07 - you know only look like you're Shining
14:09 - Light ahead of
14:10 - you the other uh problem we have is that
14:14 - because we're just blitting this light
14:15 - circle on top of the player when I stand
14:18 - next to a wall it's going to light up
14:20 - the inside of the house right because
14:22 - the the circle just doesn't know
14:24 - anything about
14:25 - obstacles right and that is something
14:28 - much more involved you know I have here
14:32 - an example of how you do you know you
14:35 - want something like this where the light
14:37 - comes out of you and goes leaves Shadows
14:41 - around
14:42 - obstacles um another example is here
14:45 - right as you move around your
14:48 - light is blocked by
14:51 - walls and you know while this is doable
14:54 - it's a it's a whole lot
14:57 - more code involved and a whole lot more
15:00 - difficult to do so that we'll have to
15:02 - wait for a another video that might be
15:06 - that might be an in-depth video that
15:07 - talks about how you do this uh how you
15:10 - do this visibility effect
15:12 - and make it look good while still not
15:17 - slowing the computer down too
15:20 - much all right P game starts to run into
15:22 - some limitations when you start trying
15:24 - to do stuff like
15:26 - that all right so I hope you like the
15:29 - the light effect I think it looks pretty
15:31 - good and has a good match with our with
15:34 - our zombie game as always thanks for
15:36 - watching and
15:38 - subscribing and I think that we're we're
15:40 - nearing the end of our zombie game
15:43 - project I think we'll uh we'll be
15:46 - calling it done pretty soon maybe maybe
15:48 - add one or two more things but um please
15:52 - feel free to comment in the comments
15:54 - below if you have any suggestions on
15:56 - what kind of things you'd like to see
15:58 - next
15:59 - uh what kind of games you'd like to make
16:02 - uh anything like that please do post it
16:04 - and we can we can figure out what else
16:07 - uh everybody wants to see all right
16:10 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
16:11 - next time bye-bye
