00:01 - welcome back this is part 10 of the
00:03 - top-down tank battle tutorial for Godot
00:06 - 3.0 this time we're going to talk about
00:09 - bullets some more we have our enemy and
00:12 - our player tank shooting but they're
00:14 - only shooting dumb bullets and so this
00:16 - time we're going to add some
00:18 - heat-seeking missiles so that we can get
00:21 - some variety and the type of weapons
00:23 - that the enemies can run around with all
00:25 - right let's get started
00:26 - here's our bullet script which is being
00:29 - inherited by both the player and the
00:32 - enemy bullets and we're gonna use a lot
00:35 - of this same code for our heat-seeking
00:38 - missile so we're gonna just add some
00:40 - code to this one so that it can hear it
00:42 - from the same place too because really
00:44 - the only difference between the plane
00:45 - bullet and the heat singing bullet is
00:47 - that one can seek a target and so if a
00:52 - bullet doesn't have a target it should
00:53 - behave you know like a regular bullet
00:56 - that travels in a straight line so we're
00:58 - gonna add one more variable here and
01:00 - this is a steer force
01:06 - the steer force is gonna be how agile
01:09 - this missile is how how quickly it can
01:12 - turn and then we're also going to have
01:15 - an acceleration vector that we need to
01:20 - track and we're gonna have a target
01:22 - variable and normally this will be null
01:25 - but we will set it for missiles to the
01:29 - player or whatever whatever thing you're
01:31 - shooting at so then when we spawn the
01:34 - bullet we're going to optionally pass it
01:37 - a target so we'll set this to null by
01:40 - default so that way if there is a target
01:45 - it'll set the value to the target to
01:48 - whatever that was that was passed in now
01:53 - in our process function if again we have
01:56 - no seeking behavior than our velocities
01:57 - gonna be constant we're just going to
01:59 - travel in a straight line but if we have
02:01 - a target we need to find the direction
02:06 - towards that target and turn towards it
02:08 - at whatever our turn speed is so that we
02:10 - can try and head towards it so that's
02:13 - going to be an acceleration so our
02:15 - acceleration our acceleration vector is
02:19 - going to be set to whatever our seek
02:25 - function returns which we're going to
02:26 - write in a minute and that's going to
02:28 - give us an acceleration towards the
02:30 - target so our velocity now gets altered
02:33 - by the acceleration times Delta we will
02:41 - we need to clamp our velocity to the
02:44 - speed because our when we you know when
02:53 - we stop to turn we're gonna be slowing
02:54 - down to turn and head back in the
02:56 - direction towards the towards the target
02:59 - if we didn't do this then we would keep
03:01 - accelerating towards the target and get
03:02 - faster and faster so we want this speed
03:04 - you know heat-seeking missile the speed
03:06 - is gonna become the maximum speed that
03:08 - can travel in a straight line and then
03:10 - we need to also change our rotation
03:12 - since we've now turned to point in a
03:14 - different direction we wanted our
03:17 - rotation to match the velocity
03:19 - angle so we were always pointing in the
03:21 - direction we're moving and then we now
03:24 - have our seek function to make and if
03:32 - you go and do some reading up on various
03:35 - steering behaviors you'll know that seek
03:36 - is one of the simpler ones it works by
03:39 - taking by finding your desired direction
03:44 - so this is the vector that we want to be
03:46 - moving in which is going to be the
03:48 - vector towards the target so that's the
03:49 - target position - the bullets position
03:54 - normalized time speed right so we want
03:58 - to move towards the target spelled
04:01 - desired wrong there we want to move
04:03 - towards the target at our maximum speed
04:05 - but our steer force now is going to be
04:08 - the amount towards that direction that
04:11 - we can turn so we take the desired the
04:16 - direction we want to go minus the
04:18 - velocity which is the direction we are
04:20 - going normalize that and multiply it by
04:27 - the steer force and that's going to pull
04:31 - us towards the desired direction by
04:32 - whatever our steer steer forces and we
04:35 - return that so now we have our
04:39 - directional steering and we just need to
04:42 - now assign this bullet to an enemy and
04:44 - have it start shooting so now to get
04:47 - this working I've created a new
04:48 - inherited scene from bullet that I've
04:51 - called missile and I'm using this image
04:54 - for it and it's just going to inherit
04:57 - from the bullet GD script now if we go
05:02 - over to our map what I'm gonna do is
05:06 - take this enemy right here and I'm gonna
05:09 - put the missile here in its bullet
05:14 - property and that'll make it fire it but
05:17 - now we need to make a couple changes to
05:19 - the tank script so that it can pass that
05:21 - target along if it needs to and actually
05:23 - we can pass the target to every bullet
05:25 - because if a bullet has its if a bullet
05:28 - has its steer force it to be a plane
05:30 - bullet anyway
05:32 - so we go into our so let's see let's go
05:35 - into our enemy tank script so our enemy
05:40 - tank script has a target that's why it
05:42 - knows to shoot so we're gonna pass that
05:44 - when we call shoot so that means that in
05:49 - our main base tank script our shoot
05:54 - function now needs to accept a target
05:56 - and we'll set that to null by default
05:58 - and we'll pass that along with the
06:03 - signal when we omit it and then that
06:06 - just means we need to go to our map
06:09 - script and then when we get the shoot
06:14 - signal we're also going to be passed a
06:17 - target and we pass that along to the
06:20 - bullet and then the bullet will have a
06:22 - target which we have already set here
06:26 - which when you set here and they we have
06:29 - set here in the start so now our target
06:31 - can be set so we'll go over to our back
06:35 - to our main here and here's the bullet
06:38 - actually the missile let's go and set
06:41 - our properties I've set the speed to 400
06:44 - the damage to 15 and the steer force to
06:46 - 25 for this missile so this guy should
06:49 - now be shooting missiles at us so let's
06:53 - go to our map and run that I'm gonna
06:56 - drive down to where he is I'm gonna
07:00 - drive past him so you can see these
07:02 - things coming at us there we go see
07:03 - other curving towards us and now
07:07 - obviously the next step is gonna be we
07:09 - can adjust that steer force we can
07:13 - adjust the lifetime of the bullet tell
07:16 - how long they're gonna chase you but
07:19 - they are curving in and if we go over to
07:21 - the other tank we'll be able to see that
07:24 - one it's still going to be firing the
07:25 - plane bullets which have this deer force
07:27 - of zero and they're still going in a
07:32 - straight line okay
07:35 - and so you can see a little variation
07:38 - I've lowered the speed and I'm gonna
07:40 - increase the steer force to 50 so you
07:43 - can see kind of a different bullet
07:45 - behavior or missile behavior I should
07:47 - say so we will go over here and you're
07:49 - gonna see the bullets will be slower but
07:51 - they're gonna have much more
07:53 - maneuverability so they're gonna attract
07:55 - me around corners pretty well so you can
07:59 - get a lot of different bullet behaviors
08:01 - just by adjusting those properties here
08:04 - of speed and steer force and make these
08:08 - missiles behave however you want now
08:11 - another thing I want to do on these
08:13 - missiles is add a bit of flare to them
08:16 - that when I have some of them to have a
08:18 - trail you know smoke trail coming up
08:20 - behind them because these are these
08:21 - aren't just dumb bullets their missiles
08:23 - they're gonna have some kind of smoke
08:25 - trail behind them so we're gonna do that
08:27 - with a particles 2d node so I've added
08:31 - the particles 2d and I'm gonna just
08:33 - quickly walk through what the settings
08:35 - were for it so I've set the amount to 30
08:38 - the lifetime to 0.4 I've turned local
08:42 - coordinates off because we wanted to win
08:44 - the missile moves I want these to stream
08:47 - out behind it probably turn that on
08:52 - there so yeah so when the missile moves
08:54 - I want these to stream out behind it we
08:57 - have added a texture so I found an
09:04 - animated texture on open game art of an
09:06 - exploit a smoky explosion and it's 24
09:09 - frames of animation so we're gonna throw
09:12 - that into the texture and set the eight
09:14 - ramps to 24 so that the frames will be
09:18 - chopped up properly I've moved the
09:22 - position accidentally put that back to
09:25 - zero and we also want to put show behind
09:30 - parent right I want it to look like the
09:33 - smoke is coming out from inside the back
09:36 - of the missile not on top of it so I put
09:38 - it back behind there like that and then
09:41 - in the process material we've turned
09:44 - gravity to zero initial velocity to zero
09:48 - I've added a scale curve where we take
09:51 - it from small around 0.2 up to 0.5 so
09:58 - it's going to grow a bit so as it turns
10:01 - into smoke it gets bigger and then we've
10:05 - also said here this is where you set the
10:07 - animation I've just hit the animation
10:09 - speed to 1 and let's take a look at what
10:13 - that looks like there we go so now our
10:23 - missiles have a nice smoke trail behind
10:26 - them now one other thing I wanted to add
10:29 - to shooting while we're working on
10:31 - shooting is a way to fire multiple shots
10:34 - like a spread of bullets and we're gonna
10:37 - set that in the tank script so we're
10:41 - going to thanks rip down we're going to
10:42 - add two new export variables gun shots
10:49 - that's how many how many bullets are
10:51 - gonna shoot and also a float which I'm
10:55 - going to constrain to that called gun
10:59 - spread and I'm gonna default that to
11:03 - zero point two so this is this is how
11:06 - many shots to fire and this is the angle
11:09 - between shots so how spread out are
11:14 - those shots and so now we need to update
11:17 - our shoot function our shoot function is
11:19 - now gonna take a number and I spread now
11:24 - normally that spread that number will be
11:26 - one and if it's one we're doing what
11:28 - we're doing we should be doing what
11:29 - we're doing right now but if num is
11:32 - greater than 1 then we want to do a loop
11:36 - and we want to loop and shoot that many
11:39 - bullets and the only difference between
11:40 - them is going to be the angle between
11:43 - them so so we can call this the I'm just
11:52 - going to use a 4 alpha for an angle the
11:55 - angle we want is negative spread Plus
12:00 - I times 2 times spread divided by a num
12:07 - minus 1 and so where did that
12:10 - complicated formula come from well this
12:13 - is because we want them to be centered
12:16 - so if I have a if I'm shooting three
12:18 - bullets I want the middle one to go
12:21 - straight and then one to the left and
12:23 - one to the right so our angle needs to
12:25 - start at a negative value and then so
12:28 - the first one would be negative whatever
12:32 - angle and then this is going to be 0
12:35 - over here because I is 0 and then the
12:38 - second one it'll be 1 times and this is
12:41 - going to be adding an additional angle
12:45 - each time so now we have an angle we
12:50 - need to emit actually we can just copy
12:52 - this one so we're going to emit the
12:53 - signal but the signal we emit is going
12:58 - to the difference is going to be the
13:00 - direction is the direction rotated by
13:06 - our alpha so we give it an additional a
13:10 - small additional rotation and then if we
13:15 - didn't so then we just will put an else
13:18 - here for this one and we emit the
13:23 - regular signal if the number of bullets
13:26 - is normal and then we'd have to change
13:29 - anything else because we're emitting the
13:30 - signal it's just we're just going to be
13:32 - emitting three bullets to the main
13:34 - instead of one so let's go back over to
13:37 - our map and I'm going to change the
13:41 - enemy that has the missiles assigned and
13:45 - I'm going to set his shots - let's try
13:49 - three and now let's run over going to
13:54 - see him fire three shots
14:01 - oh and we forgot to add it so now when
14:12 - we call shoot we need to pass numb and
14:15 - spread so that's in enemy tank shoot so
14:19 - here in the enemy tank we need pass gun
14:23 - shots and
14:26 - spread okay let's give it a shot
14:32 - you should have three a volley of three
14:35 - missiles every shot there we go and
14:37 - that's gonna kill me real fast
14:39 - cool so now we have this functionality
14:42 - we can customize our enemy tanks and our
14:45 - player for that matter to have multi
14:48 - shots we can have a spray of regular
14:51 - bullets we got a spray of heat-seeking
14:52 - missiles all right so I hope this was
14:55 - helpful for you and I look forward to
14:58 - getting back into this I have a bunch of
15:00 - things that we're gonna add in upcoming
15:02 - videos if you have any suggestions or
15:04 - comments please add them in the comments
15:06 - below and I'll see you in the next video
15:16 - you
