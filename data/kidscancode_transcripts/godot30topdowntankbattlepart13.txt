00:01 - okay welcome back to the top-down tank
00:03 - battle game in Godot 3 this time around
00:07 - we're gonna add a couple of small quick
00:10 - features one one about the tank and one
00:13 - visual effect stay tuned to the end
00:15 - because I do have a little bit of an
00:18 - announcement about the upcoming Godot
00:20 - 3.1 release and I'd love to hear all of
00:24 - your opinions about it but for now let's
00:28 - dive into the code so the first small
00:30 - feature I want to add is I want the
00:32 - driving to be a little faster when your
00:36 - tank is on the road or to put that the
00:39 - opposite way it's slower when you're off
00:41 - road so that way when you drive along
00:43 - the roads you'll be you know you'll be
00:44 - encouraged to drive along the road
00:46 - because you'll get there faster so the
00:48 - way we're going to do that is by
00:50 - checking what tile is underneath our
00:53 - position if the tile that's underneath
00:55 - our position is one of these terrain
00:59 - tiles actually I decided to do it this
01:02 - way because there's fewer terrain tiles
01:03 - then there are Road tiles because of all
01:06 - the curves and everything like that so
01:08 - if we're on one of these non road tiles
01:11 - our speed is going to be lowered
01:15 - otherwise we'll go our current higher
01:18 - speed so we need a list of those tiles
01:21 - so I'm gonna go in my script tab here
01:24 - and I'm gonna create a new script and
01:27 - I'm gonna call this Global's
01:31 - this is going to hold global variables
01:35 - of which we're probably gonna need more
01:37 - later this will just be the first so
01:40 - we're gonna make this script and it's
01:42 - going to have in it a variable called
01:47 - slow terrain and this is a list which
01:52 - I've already made of the tiles that are
01:56 - the terrain so we go back over to 2d
01:59 - here and we're in the tile map you can
02:02 - see right number zero not number one
02:06 - number ten etc alright so I just made a
02:08 - list of the ones that are terrain and
02:10 - like I said there's a lot more Road ones
02:13 - so
02:14 - easier this way so we're gonna save that
02:19 - script and we're gonna add it in the
02:24 - project settings as an auto load so we
02:28 - want to go and pick that script Global's
02:31 - and we want to add it and for the name
02:36 - I'm gonna put this in all caps mainly so
02:41 - that when I'm using it in scripts it
02:44 - stands out it's just a visibility thing
02:47 - personal preference so okay so now what
02:51 - happens is that auto load will be
02:54 - automatically loaded in every scene so
02:57 - whatever script you're using will have
02:58 - access via that Global's
03:00 - name to whatever functions or data is in
03:06 - this script so in our tank I'm gonna go
03:10 - over a tank script now and we're going
03:13 - to add a couple more configuration
03:15 - variables we're gonna add we're gonna
03:20 - add a let's call it off-road friction
03:24 - that's gonna be how how much does being
03:28 - offered slow you down right and that way
03:31 - we can make tanks have different values
03:33 - for that and let's see on the tank here
03:37 - let's set the default for that to 1.5 so
03:43 - basically you'll be doing 50% slower now
03:49 - in the script also what we need to do is
03:53 - we need a reference to the map so that
03:56 - we can access what tile is underneath us
04:03 - okay and the main scene will we'll set
04:08 - that value when the player spawns so
04:12 - down here in our process function or
04:16 - sorry physics process function right if
04:19 - here after we've checked the controls if
04:23 - we have a map set its that variable set
04:26 - then we need to figure out which tile is
04:29 - underneath us so the tile that's
04:31 - underneath us will get the cell for our
04:36 - position using the world to map so we
04:43 - convert our position into map
04:46 - coordinates and then get the cell that's
04:49 - there which is going to be an integer
04:50 - value the number so if that tile is in
04:56 - Global's dot slow terrain then we want
05:01 - to make our velocity and we're gonna
05:03 - just going to divide it by off-road
05:06 - friction actually come to think of it
05:08 - why would I want to do it that way let's
05:10 - multiply it by off-road friction and
05:12 - let's just set the off-road friction to
05:18 - 3/4 all right so so you go 3/4 speed
05:23 - when you are off-road ok so now how do
05:27 - we set that map value well that's going
05:30 - to be in our mean our map script here in
05:35 - the map script we're going to set that
05:39 - in ready
05:42 - so in ready we're going to say set the
05:47 - player's map variable a equal to and I
05:52 - want to set it to the ground tile map
05:57 - all right let's give this a try
06:07 - okay so now I'm driving along going kind
06:11 - of slowly but when I get on the road
06:14 - yeah I'm faster so let's see if I just
06:17 - go in a straight line I speed up when I
06:20 - go across there so now we can set that
06:24 - for different tanks to different values
06:27 - and you'll be able to go a lot faster or
06:31 - a lot slower whether you're on the road
06:34 - or not okay so another small effect I
06:39 - want to make is I want an indicator when
06:41 - a tank's damage is getting a low that
06:46 - will show that it's almost dead right so
06:48 - the or that it's damaged so it has some
06:50 - smoke coming off and so we're gonna use
06:53 - a particle 2d node for that so I'm going
06:56 - to make a new actually I'm going to make
06:58 - a new scene and we're gonna use a
07:01 - particles 2d I'm gonna call this smoke
07:06 - and I'm going to save it in the effects
07:11 - folder so we can attach this to any of
07:16 - the tanks we'll attach it to the to the
07:18 - route tank script or the route tank
07:20 - scene so what do we want this to do so
07:26 - to get started we don't have to get too
07:29 - fancy with this we can really just use
07:31 - the default
07:33 - particle shapes and things and we can
07:36 - always come back and adjust it when we
07:37 - see what it looks like so let's see here
07:39 - I want more than eight particles let's
07:42 - try 50 and see if that's too many or not
07:47 - lifetime we'll see how we feel about
07:52 - that one what do we want explosiveness
07:55 - now we can keep that those are all fine
08:01 - what else do we want to change on here
08:07 - position I'll adjust that when we add it
08:10 - to the tank
08:17 - yeah we'll see about that one these only
08:20 - added to tank but for process material
08:21 - we want to add a new particles material
08:24 - right which generates the default
08:26 - particles which are little square ones
08:29 - just dropping off the screen so we go
08:33 - into that particles material and this is
08:34 - where we're gonna set lots of these
08:37 - flags so let's see let's go through them
08:41 - one by one so for the emission shape I
08:45 - want to use a box so I want them to
08:48 - spawn you know in an area not in one
08:51 - spot so let's make the extents of the
08:55 - Box wider okay let's make gravity V zero
09:05 - because we don't want that all right so
09:16 - now they're spawning first let's see
09:18 - what's spread spread probably want that
09:23 - to be a little bit smaller and we'll
09:28 - mess around with the velocity and stuff
09:30 - let's get the appearance going so for
09:33 - this scale right I want these to be
09:39 - larger but then I also want there to be
09:43 - a scale curve meaning when they spawn
09:48 - well maybe not
09:50 - let's just let's see what it looks like
09:51 - with the color I'm going sort of doing
09:53 - this as we go so for the color we're
09:55 - gonna use a color ramp which is a
10:00 - gradient from one color to another let's
10:06 - make a new gradient let's edit that now
10:10 - we want it to start out as kind of a
10:14 - maybe a grayish color
10:20 - and then I wanted to fade towards black
10:24 - but also with a low alpha yeah that's
10:34 - pretty good now they're all spawning in
10:38 - the same spot and not moving so we can
10:40 - also go to our velocity settings and
10:43 - give it a little bit of a initial
10:48 - velocity because I think that is set
10:51 - very small there we go although why is
11:02 - it going we have our color ramp going
11:09 - the wrong way
11:15 - I wanted this one to be the solid color
11:22 - and then this one over here to be the
11:29 - black lo alpha there we go yeah let's
11:41 - make this one a little lighter okay and
11:54 - let's give it a little tangential
11:58 - acceleration that will make it sort of
12:04 - flow off to the side if it's looking
12:07 - choppy to you and this is from the
12:09 - screen capture it'll be better once we
12:12 - get it all going so there's that so I'm
12:17 - gonna save that and then over in the
12:20 - tank script we're going to attach this
12:23 - to the tank so we're gonna add an
12:28 - instance of the smoke so let's take that
12:32 - smoke and let's flip it 180 degrees I
12:36 - want it to be going off in that
12:38 - direction and let's shift it back
12:41 - towards the back of the tank a little
12:42 - bit okay
12:49 - save that let's look what that looks
12:52 - like on the player there we go so a
12:55 - little bit of smoke looking at these
12:57 - coming out of the back of the engine
12:59 - there that's a good start we'll come
13:02 - back and tweak it later but now we want
13:04 - that to either turn on or off depending
13:06 - on the tanks health so in the tanks
13:10 - script when it's ready we're going to
13:17 - let's see in the hell yeah so when it's
13:24 - ready we're just going to turn it off
13:31 - all right we set the emitting to false
13:34 - because we don't want it to be showing
13:36 - and then it turns on or off depending on
13:39 - your health right so when you take
13:41 - damage we want to turn it on so so let's
13:53 - put that here if health is less than max
13:57 - health
14:00 - let's save your below half then I want
14:06 - to set emitting to true and then when
14:09 - you heal I want to do the opposite all
14:24 - right let's see what that looks like
14:25 - when we run this okay
14:33 - so I haven't taken any damage let's go
14:36 - up here and get hits um when my health
14:39 - gets low
14:40 - oh I'm smoking up did you notice what I
14:43 - forgot so on the smoke our problem is
14:48 - that we are stuck on local coordinates
14:51 - so in the drawing we want to turn off
14:55 - local coordinates local coordinates
14:58 - makes the particles stay attached to the
15:01 - emitter so that when the tank is turning
15:03 - all the smoke turns with it but we want
15:05 - it to trail off and not be attached to
15:08 - the tank anymore let's try that again
15:21 - there we go
15:23 - all right so now I'm leaving off that
15:26 - trail of smoke I probably am gonna play
15:31 - around with this some more and fiddle
15:33 - around with the emission time right how
15:37 - long the particles last maybe the speed
15:39 - they go at but you get the idea right
15:43 - particles you can have a lot of fun just
15:44 - playing around with them and trying a
15:46 - bunch of different settings so I'm going
15:48 - to tweak that off-camera and we can move
15:53 - on to the next step so one other thing I
15:58 - want to do oh we should probably put
15:59 - that below the turret - huh let's do
16:04 - that real quick so we want the smoke to
16:07 - be rendering before the turret alright
16:17 - so one of the reasons that it's been a
16:22 - little slower making these is because of
16:25 - the upcoming release of Godot 3.1 and
16:29 - now that 3.1 is in beta I've been
16:32 - spending some time taking a look at the
16:34 - features and I'm trying to decide
16:37 - whether I want to shift this project
16:40 - over to 3.1 right once 3.1 comes out
16:44 - people are going to want to toriel's and
16:46 - examples and things that are targeted
16:49 - towards that now the good news is that
16:51 - the move from 3.0 3.1 isn't going to
16:54 - change a lot about this project the
16:59 - obviously the older videos are going to
17:02 - look different because the UI has
17:04 - changed a little bit the inspector looks
17:06 - a little bit different so I think what
17:08 - I'm gonna do is do an example video of
17:13 - that of 3.1 and sort of get everybody's
17:16 - opinion on what they want me to do if
17:19 - they want me to start working on
17:20 - shifting this over to 3.1 or if you want
17:23 - to stick 3.0 for now and deal with that
17:26 - later feel free to leave your comments
17:29 - in the comments
17:32 - you know let me know what you think what
17:34 - you want me to do about this upcoming
17:38 - new version of Godot
17:39 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
17:41 - next time here I'm just tacking out the
17:45 - end if you want to see a different way
17:46 - to do the particles I added a little red
17:50 - orange there to make it look like
17:52 - there's fire before the smoke comes out
17:55 - again a lot of different ways you can do
17:57 - this I encourage you to play around with
17:59 - the particle nodes yourself and make
18:01 - something that you think looks good
18:10 - you
