00:00 - welcome back to know your nodes this is
00:02 - the series of Godot game engine videos
00:03 - where we take a single node type and
00:05 - show how it's used this time around
00:07 - we're going to be talking about a very
00:09 - popular node that a lot of people have
00:13 - trouble with it's the tile map node time
00:17 - app games are really common they're used
00:18 - for all kinds of styles of games like
00:21 - dungeon crawlers Legend of Zelda style
00:23 - RPGs strategy games even side-scrolling
00:27 - platformers like Megaman use tiles to
00:30 - design their levels sometimes it's
00:32 - obvious that the game is using tiles and
00:35 - sometimes they're not very visible at
00:37 - all but they're still being used behind
00:39 - the scenes basically all it means is
00:41 - that a grid of tiles is being used to
00:44 - layout the game world the graphics the
00:47 - map the movement of this price
00:48 - everything is based on an underlying
00:50 - grid and Godot has all sorts of tools to
00:54 - help you build out your tile map and
00:56 - interact with it as you're making your
00:59 - game so let's get started the first
01:03 - thing you need for your tile map is you
01:05 - need a tile set a tile set is a
01:07 - collection of the images that you're
01:09 - going to use to draw your map with so I
01:11 - have here a art pack for a top-down
01:15 - tower-defense
01:16 - style game that's made up of 64 by 64
01:19 - tiles and also two different colors and
01:22 - that's what we're going to use to make
01:24 - our map with Sol so start a new scene
01:28 - and just add a node 2d for your root
01:31 - node I'm just calling this tile fit top
01:33 - down and then you're going to add a
01:36 - sprite and this sprite is going to be a
01:39 - tile so we're going to drop the texture
01:44 - in there turn on regen and then the
01:48 - texture region region that we want to
01:50 - use is going to be one of these 64 by 64
01:53 - sections and so it's very useful to turn
01:56 - on the grid snap so that you can only
02:00 - select exactly 64 by 64 segments and you
02:06 - will make sure you get the tile sliced
02:08 - out correctly so there we go there's our
02:13 - is our first tile we're going to turn on
02:17 - snapping and the grid on the screen here
02:20 - too just because it's easier to place
02:22 - things around so this grid is very
02:25 - useful you can you just turn on the snap
02:28 - turn on the show and under configure you
02:30 - can set how you want it to look alright
02:33 - so here's our first tile and you're just
02:36 - going to do that with all the tiles you
02:38 - want to use now I'm going to skip that
02:42 - part because this can get kind of
02:43 - repetitive but you can just going to add
02:45 - another sprite like if i duplicate it
02:47 - throw another one over here
02:49 - we're going to just change the texture
02:52 - region and say we were using that one
02:54 - for example and you just keep doing that
02:58 - process for all the tiles that you want
03:00 - to use okay here's our top set after
03:03 - I've sliced out a bunch of the tiles and
03:05 - I'm just using the ones for creating the
03:08 - the roads and things and and leaving out
03:11 - a lot of the other ones because I didn't
03:12 - feel like doing them but here's my pal
03:15 - set and I've just kind of grouped them
03:17 - together together visually the order
03:20 - that they are in in the inspector here
03:25 - is the order they're going to show up in
03:27 - your tile map as well so when you're
03:31 - drawing with them if you place them in
03:32 - some sort of order they'll remain
03:34 - organized in that in that order as well
03:37 - so so this scene now has just a bunch of
03:40 - sprites in it that define the tiles that
03:42 - I want to use for my map so then you're
03:44 - going to click on scene and you can say
03:46 - convert to tile set and when you do that
03:51 - you're going to save it as a TR es or a
03:56 - text resource file and you can place
04:00 - that wherever you want to place it and
04:02 - then you just hit save now we're ready
04:05 - to start making a tile map so I'm adding
04:07 - a new scene here and I'm going to add a
04:09 - tile map node okay and then this time
04:13 - I've node you see we'll have a bunch of
04:15 - properties the most important one is
04:17 - what mode you want so if you see here
04:20 - you can have a square map which is a
04:23 - bunch of squares you can have isometric
04:25 - which means you're going to have that
04:27 - skewed perspective where you're looking
04:29 - down at things from the side and then
04:31 - you can also put custom here and
04:33 - customize how you want your map to be
04:36 - deformed from square we're going to
04:38 - leave this as square for our top down
04:40 - because that's the format the tiles are
04:42 - in make sure you set your cell size to
04:45 - the same size as your tiles quadrants
04:49 - size we don't need to worry about that
04:50 - the performance that the performance
04:52 - setting it just breaks up large maps
04:55 - into quadrants and only load them a bit
04:57 - at a time and then we can talk about
05:02 - these other ones after we have started
05:06 - drawing so we just need to set our tile
05:08 - set here so click load and select that
05:12 - tough that you just made and now over
05:14 - here on the side you will see all of
05:15 - your tiles showing up and you can you
05:18 - can zoom them in and out make them
05:20 - whatever size you want to look at them
05:22 - in and this pane will drag side to side
05:25 - as well if you want it to be a bunch of
05:27 - tiles at once and you're ready to start
05:30 - drawing so select a tile you want click
05:35 - out here and start drawing and then
05:36 - there you go you have some tiles and
05:39 - there's a couple of useful shortcuts as
05:42 - well these buttons over here are mirror
05:46 - in the X in the y-direction the
05:48 - shortcuts for those are a and F so for
05:50 - example if I've got this one here if I
05:53 - click a do the tile it's flipping back
05:57 - and forth when if I click S its flipping
05:59 - up and down these four buttons here will
06:02 - rotate the tile by 90 degrees so rotate
06:05 - rotate rotate and you can then go along
06:13 - and draw things however you want to draw
06:14 - them you probably want this one here
06:18 - let's rotate this that way there's some
06:25 - shortcuts here under the top menu here
06:28 - the bucket tool is useful you want to
06:31 - fill in some empty space you click that
06:35 - and it will fill in in paint bucket
06:39 - style that area
06:42 - you can the control is a shortcut for
06:46 - pick tile so if you want to draw some
06:48 - more of this tile for example and you
06:50 - don't want to go over here and find it
06:51 - in your time app just hold down ctrl and
06:53 - click on it and you'll pick up that tile
06:55 - again notice as I'm moving around up
06:59 - here is showing what my tile coordinates
07:02 - are right the origin right here is zero
07:05 - zero and you see the X increasing in
07:07 - this direction the Y increasing in this
07:09 - direction and when you hover over a tile
07:12 - it'll also tell you what tile number
07:14 - that is so that's tile number eight
07:16 - right here Tom number eight a couple of
07:20 - other things if you want to erase tiles
07:22 - just use the right mouse button and that
07:24 - will delete the tile if you have drawn a
07:29 - particular shape and you're wanting to
07:32 - duplicate it you can click on Tom up
07:36 - here and say select and that will let
07:38 - you drag a selection box around a group
07:41 - of tiles and then duplicate selection
07:44 - will duplicate that and the shortcuts
07:48 - for those are listed right next to the
07:51 - commands so here's a simple map maybe
07:55 - for a tower defense game where you have
07:57 - some mobs coming in and let's say you
07:59 - want to play some objects on this so
08:02 - I've got another house idea that has
08:05 - some rocks and trees and things and I
08:07 - want to place those in my map and I
08:10 - didn't make them part of the original
08:11 - tile set because I want them to be laid
08:15 - on top and so if you want to have layers
08:17 - of Tom Maps you can have as many as you
08:20 - want you can just add another tile map
08:22 - this might be for objects and then we're
08:27 - just going to load that tile set so
08:30 - we're going to load that tile set here
08:31 - the objects tile set and then you can
08:34 - just kind of sprinkle these around
08:36 - wherever you want there to be some trees
08:41 - and rocks and things
08:45 - and that's how you would do your various
08:53 - decorations and things and that's the
08:56 - basics of using a tile map but what if
08:58 - you want some of these tiles to be
09:00 - interactive you want the them to be part
09:03 - of the environment and when the player
09:04 - moves around or other objects move
09:07 - around you want them to be we want them
09:10 - to have collision on them or various
09:13 - other things well you have a few options
09:15 - there so when you're creating your tiles
09:20 - you can attach to these sprites three
09:26 - different things you can cut you can
09:28 - attach a static body which means it's
09:30 - going to have a collision shape so you
09:34 - can define that you can use a collision
09:36 - shape or a collision polygon which we'll
09:37 - see in a second you can attach a
09:40 - navigation polygon which will allow it
09:44 - to be part of a navigation layer if you
09:48 - want to use pathfinding on your map and
09:50 - you can also attach a light occluder 2d
09:54 - so that you can make all or part of your
09:56 - tile block light when you have lighting
09:59 - on your 2d map so the most common one is
10:04 - to put collisions on right very often
10:07 - need to do that and to do that let's
10:09 - take a look at making a 2d platformer
10:12 - out of tiles okay for this example I'm
10:15 - going to be using this sprite sheet
10:18 - which has buncha tiles for making
10:20 - different types of platforms and ramps
10:22 - and things for a 2d platformer so here's
10:26 - my sprite that I've made using one of
10:28 - those tiles and I'm going to attach to
10:31 - that sprite a static body 2d and this
10:36 - static body 2d is going to have a
10:39 - collision we can use a collision shape
10:42 - where we can use a Cochin polygon I'm
10:44 - going to use a collision polygon and
10:45 - I'll show you why so if we zoom in on
10:47 - this right and we set use pixel snap I
10:54 - want to make sure I'm snapping to the
10:56 - pixel as I draw the polygon
10:58 - okay drawing a polygon is very easy you
11:00 - click on the little pencil here and you
11:03 - just start clicking locations where you
11:06 - want corners and then when you click
11:09 - back you have now connected up and made
11:11 - a polygon if we zoom in you can click on
11:14 - this button right here to adjust the
11:20 - positioning of your polygon and this is
11:23 - this is just a plain old square tile so
11:25 - you see I was off down here in the
11:26 - corner a little bit so I'll move that
11:28 - one over this is a plain old square tile
11:29 - so we're just going to have a square
11:31 - collision now you want to make sure that
11:35 - you're very careful about getting the
11:38 - edges of your collision polygon lined up
11:42 - with the edges of the tile so that when
11:45 - you place these in the map there won't
11:47 - be there won't be gaps if you have
11:49 - another tile next to it and you had a
11:51 - problem like this then the next tile
11:54 - over would not connect up exactly and
11:57 - when your player walks along you're
11:59 - going to get stuck on little corners and
12:02 - have all sorts of strange collisions
12:05 - happening so make sure you have
12:07 - everything lined up just right so here's
12:11 - a bunch of other tiles that I've added
12:13 - and some of these tiles have curved
12:17 - corners so we can see if we look at this
12:20 - one this collision polygon I've added
12:23 - some corners here to give it a little
12:26 - bit of a rounded edge and you can do
12:29 - that we've got triangular ones here
12:34 - here's kind of like the top of a column
12:36 - that has two rounded sides and I've just
12:40 - sort of rounded those out a little bit
12:42 - so now this is my tile set and I just
12:47 - save this as a tile set to use in my map
12:49 - and when you draw your map you're going
12:51 - to draw it out the same way we did with
12:53 - the top-down map place the tiles where
12:55 - you want them rotate them around
12:57 - whatever and then just to show you what
13:00 - it looks like with a in action with a
13:04 - player I've just made a little level
13:07 - here with the map and a player sprite
13:09 - that I've made from another project
13:12 - and if we hit play on this you'll see
13:16 - that there's the sprite and I can move
13:18 - around and I have collision everywhere
13:23 - that I drew it on each tile if you look
13:33 - at if you turn on collision shapes you
13:35 - can see that each of these polygons is
13:41 - being blended together and we don't see
13:43 - any gaps which is which is good that's
13:45 - what we wanted to see so I hope this
13:47 - video helps you when you're making your
13:49 - own tile maps in Godot there's actually
13:52 - a lot more that you can do with time
13:55 - apps this video is getting kind of long
13:57 - so I'm going to break this into a second
13:59 - installment and in the next one I will
14:01 - talk about how you can interact with
14:05 - tile Maps through GD script so that you
14:09 - can make dynamic maps you can make
14:11 - animated tiles lots of different things
14:14 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
14:17 - next time
14:25 - you
