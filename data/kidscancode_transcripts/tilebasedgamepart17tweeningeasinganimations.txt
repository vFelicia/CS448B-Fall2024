00:00 - welcome back this is part 17 of our
00:03 - top-down zombie shooter game in this
00:07 - video we're gonna be talking about
00:09 - tweening or easing functions those two
00:12 - words are sometimes used interchangeably
00:14 - in game development they refer to the
00:19 - same thing it's a way to do animations
00:24 - that are nicer looking which you'll see
00:27 - from some of the examples that we're
00:28 - going to do and to start with what we're
00:30 - gonna do is use an easing function to
00:33 - cause our health pack item to sort of
00:36 - bob up and down to make it look a little
00:38 - more appealing and noticeable to the
00:40 - player so we could go over to our sprite
00:44 - here and we could add a def update it's
00:48 - going to describe how this item is going
00:50 - to move and we wanted to move upwards
00:51 - and downwards in a little bobbing motion
00:54 - and we don't want to have that look very
00:58 - or we want that to look very smooth and
01:01 - like a natural-looking bouncing motion
01:04 - and the easiest way to do that is using
01:06 - something called an easing function so
01:10 - this webpage is a great example of some
01:13 - easing functions so and what an easing
01:15 - function does is it interpolates meaning
01:19 - it describes how a value changes over
01:24 - time from point A to point B right it
01:28 - could be the motion of an object it
01:31 - could be the transparency of an object
01:33 - or fading out any way you get from some
01:37 - starting point to some ending point so
01:40 - in our example how we get from the
01:44 - starting position to the other end of
01:48 - the bounce on how we go back right so
01:50 - how we go back in between two points and
01:53 - if we just had a constant speed we would
01:56 - be following a linear pattern like this
01:58 - and so the the item would just be moving
02:03 - straight down then instantly change the
02:05 - direction and going back and it would
02:06 - look very harsh so we can use these
02:10 - other other kinds of easing functions to
02:12 - change
02:13 - the rate at which the motion happens for
02:18 - example this is one called quadratic and
02:22 - so you can see it's much more gradual
02:25 - as it gets down and you can do those in
02:28 - either direction right or even in both
02:33 - right and that's very smooth the sine
02:38 - wave is a very nice one because what
02:42 - this could look like and if we do in and
02:44 - out is that the object accelerates up
02:47 - decelerates down towards the bottom and
02:50 - then would do the reverse okay there's
02:53 - all sorts of fun easing functions like
02:56 - the bouncing one where you can bounce
02:58 - through your way in or the elastic one
03:00 - where you go past your point you want to
03:03 - go to and then snap back down and there
03:09 - are lots of fun to play around with and
03:11 - very useful so the problem we have is
03:14 - that tie game does not have any easing
03:17 - functions built into it and we could
03:20 - write them but that could be
03:22 - time-consuming and it turns out there is
03:24 - a really good Python tweening library
03:27 - out there that will be good enough for
03:30 - us to use so we just need to install it
03:34 - okay like most Python libraries the
03:38 - easiest way to install it is with pit
03:41 - depending on your system
03:43 - you might be using pit before pip3
03:45 - you're just gonna say pit three install
03:49 - PI tweening and it will go and download
03:54 - it install it and that's all there is to
03:56 - it you can double check to make sure
03:59 - it's installed if you just do an import
04:01 - PI tweening as long as you don't get an
04:04 - error message then it found the library
04:07 - okay so what we can do now is we can
04:13 - import that I'm sorry I'm not from
04:19 - import tight weaning as I'm just gonna
04:24 - name it tween because it's a little
04:25 - easier to type
04:28 - all right now we're ready to go down
04:30 - here and set up our items bobbing
04:35 - animation using the tween engine and so
04:39 - first we're gonna do is we're gonna
04:41 - define which of those tweeting functions
04:45 - we're going to use and I want to use the
04:49 - ease in out sign one and so it'll be
04:55 - easy here to change the name of which
04:56 - function you want to use if you want to
04:57 - see some different effects but I think
04:59 - this is the one that's gonna look the
05:01 - best for what we want to see then we're
05:06 - going to define what the range of the
05:09 - bobbing is actually just to keep things
05:15 - simple why don't we make that a setting
05:17 - so we'll go over to our settings here
05:20 - and in the items how many pixels up and
05:24 - down you know how much up and down do we
05:26 - want the thing to Bob and so that's
05:29 - something we can adjust whenever we want
05:32 - and then we're also going to have the
05:35 - Bob speed how fast is it going to move
05:39 - up and down and you'll see where that
05:42 - comes in as well so those are the two
05:44 - kind of settings that we need to define
05:48 - how our bobbing is going to work okay
05:54 - so what we're going to do is remember
05:59 - that the way that the tweening functions
06:01 - work is they always give you back a
06:04 - value between zero and one okay let's
06:09 - look at an example okay just to manually
06:12 - go through this a little bit so let's
06:19 - say let's say we had something that we
06:23 - wanted to move ten steps right so we're
06:28 - gonna move something ten steps
06:32 - and we want to use a tween to go between
06:37 - those two steps well if I do tween dot
06:41 - linear you're gonna see that's a
06:47 - straight line right we just go a tenth
06:49 - of the way each time so we're moving ten
06:51 - steps so we go a tenth of the way each
06:54 - step now that's obviously the linear
07:00 - thing we wouldn't even need the tween
07:01 - library technically to do that easy to
07:03 - add point one each time but if we want
07:06 - one of those nice animated like curves
07:09 - we saw in that animation we want to use
07:12 - one of the other ones so let's say
07:15 - instead for our ten steps we want to use
07:20 - tween ease in sine okay then this is
07:28 - what we get and so these values are the
07:31 - values along that curve that we saw in
07:35 - the animation so the way that these
07:39 - tweens work is you pass into the
07:42 - function sum value between zero and one
07:46 - from are you at the starting point zero
07:48 - or you it 1 the ending point or anywhere
07:51 - in between and then it will give back to
07:54 - you a value between 0 and 1 for what
07:58 - step along the way you should be at so
08:01 - you give it a value between 0 and 1 you
08:03 - get back a value between 0 and 1 okay so
08:06 - this step is going to be keeping track
08:09 - of where we are between 0 and 1 or
08:13 - between the start and end point so we
08:16 - know what to pass into the function ok
08:18 - and then we are also going to have a
08:25 - direction because we also we're going to
08:28 - want to do this in both directions we're
08:30 - going to lob up and then Bob down so
08:32 - we're going to reverse the direction so
08:34 - we'll change that number between 1 and
08:36 - negative 1 all right so this update is
08:41 - going to do the bobbing motion
08:43 - okay and so what we're gonna do is we're
08:47 - gonna find how much do we need to move
08:51 - all right here let's call it offset all
08:54 - right how much do we need to move from
08:56 - our starting position so we're going to
09:00 - take the Bob range and we're going to
09:05 - multiply it by whatever we get back from
09:08 - the tweening so we're gonna say take the
09:11 - tween use self dot step divided by Bob
09:16 - range so that's the percentage the way
09:20 - along we are and I'm Ness subtracting
09:23 - zero point five and the reason I'm going
09:25 - to do that is remember tween gives us
09:28 - back a value between zero and one but
09:31 - because we're starting in the center of
09:34 - our bobbing motion right from wherever
09:37 - we place the the health pack we wanted
09:41 - to bob up some and down some so this is
09:43 - just shifting it halfway okay and we
09:47 - multiply that by the Bob range so then
09:53 - that just means we can move the
09:56 - rectangle Center Y and just add the
10:06 - position oops I just noticed we didn't
10:10 - save our position there we go didn't do
10:15 - that before so we just take our Y
10:17 - position and we add the offset times the
10:26 - direction right so when it flips it'll
10:29 - go in the other direction then we take
10:32 - our step and we increment it by the Bob
10:39 - speed
10:40 - and if if our step gets greater than Bob
10:48 - range then we are going to set it back
10:51 - to zero and we're going to reverse
10:54 - direction so we just reverse the VAT the
10:58 - sign on the direction okay so just to
11:04 - walk through it again every frame we're
11:07 - gonna calculate how far we are along in
11:11 - the tween so what step we're on as a
11:14 - percentage of the total range shift it
11:18 - by half the value so we start in the
11:21 - middle and then we're going to add that
11:23 - offset to the rectangles position and
11:27 - then we're just going to make sure that
11:29 - as we increment the step if we get to
11:31 - the maximum we go back to zero and start
11:34 - over again
11:34 - and the direction will be in the
11:35 - opposite direction so we'll bounce down
11:37 - so let's see what that looks like oh I
11:45 - forgot I spawned my health pack down
11:49 - here in the corner changed it on my map
11:51 - so there you see the health pack bobbing
11:54 - up and down now if that's too fast for
11:58 - you you can change that Bob step and it
12:01 - will bounce more or less and you can
12:05 - change the range to like I think that
12:07 - range might be a little too high let's
12:10 - go back over to our settings and maybe
12:12 - make the range
12:14 - let's try 15 go into the house so it got
12:24 - stuck all right so I made the range a
12:27 - little smaller but the speed is still
12:29 - the same so that means it's going to
12:30 - cover that range faster so if you make
12:32 - the range a little smaller you probably
12:34 - want to make the speed a little slower
12:35 - too
12:45 - there we go that's not too bad so you
12:49 - can play around with that you could try
12:51 - some of the other you could try some of
12:53 - the other tweens it might be easier to
12:56 - see what the difference is if you make
12:59 - the arrange a lot bigger but you can see
13:02 - if you change some of these you'll get
13:04 - very different effects like let's try
13:11 - this one just to show you so yeah it
13:19 - goes it's a much faster transition so
13:22 - it's moving faster in the middle part of
13:24 - the range right so not as very not not
13:29 - as smooth as the sign one looks alright
13:31 - so we're gonna keep that sign oops sign
13:36 - okay
13:42 - okay hopefully you can see some of the
13:44 - power of these tweens or easing
13:47 - functions now that we're starting to use
13:49 - them well there's a lot of things we can
13:51 - use them for not just the bobbing up and
13:54 - down of the items but if you want to
13:57 - fade in or fade out an image you can use
14:01 - it for that if you want to transition
14:03 - something from one color to another you
14:06 - can use an easing function to do that
14:09 - when things come onto the screen or go
14:12 - off the screen when you when you
14:14 - transition to a menu or another or
14:19 - another screen when you when you want to
14:22 - move from one map to another there's a
14:24 - lot of places where you can use these
14:25 - easing functions to make your
14:28 - transitions and animations look a lot
14:31 - nicer all right so that will do it for
14:35 - this video I hope you enjoyed it and as
