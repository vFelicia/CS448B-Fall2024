00:03 - welcome back to the pame game
00:05 - development series we're continuing to
00:07 - work on our schmu game and this time
00:09 - around we're going to talk about
00:11 - collisions which means how do you tell
00:13 - when one thing on the screen runs into
00:15 - another
00:18 - thing okay currently we have a player
00:22 - Sprite and we have a bunch of enemies
00:25 - running around flying around the screen
00:27 - in different directions and now we need
00:29 - to have something happen if one of those
00:33 - enemy red squares runs into our
00:37 - player and for now we're just going to
00:39 - say if it happens then the game is over
00:44 - um if you get hit you are dead so how do
00:48 - we do that
00:49 - well what we need to do is we need to
00:51 - look at the rectangle of the player and
00:55 - we need to look at the rectangle of the
00:56 - mob and say do those two things overlap
01:01 - now that can start to get complicated
01:02 - because you have a lot of coordinates to
01:04 - keep track of the left side the right
01:05 - side the top side the bottom of this one
01:07 - and of this one and then I need to go
01:10 - through and do it for every single one
01:11 - that's on the screen to see if any of
01:12 - them hit it and that can get uh kind of
01:16 - tedious and require a lot of code but
01:18 - fortunately pame has a nice handy uh
01:23 - command that we can use and we're going
01:25 - to do that in our update section of our
01:28 - game Loop
01:30 - what we're going to do is after we
01:32 - update all the
01:33 - Sprites we're going to check to see if
01:36 - uh a mob hit the player okay and how we
01:43 - do that is we're going to use a command
01:44 - called py game. sprite. Sprite
01:50 - Collide and the way that the Sprite
01:52 - Collide command works is you need to put
01:55 - in the
01:57 - parentheses you need to put what Sprite
02:00 - you want to check so we want to check
02:01 - the player Sprite then you need to put
02:04 - what group you want to check against so
02:07 - we're going to check the mobs group and
02:09 - remember we made this group that has all
02:11 - the mobs in
02:12 - it and this will tell us whether any of
02:15 - the mobs hit the
02:17 - player and then we're also going to put
02:19 - in here um you can say false or true and
02:25 - what that controls is whether the mob
02:28 - that you do hit or whichever thing in
02:30 - this group you hit should be deleted or
02:33 - not um we're going to make a game over
02:35 - so it doesn't really matter but we can
02:37 - use that later for for other things so
02:40 - this command when you run it will give
02:42 - you back a
02:44 - list so we're going to call this list
02:48 - hits so this will be a list of any of
02:50 - the mobs that hit the player if none of
02:54 - them did that list will be empty won't
02:55 - have anything in it um it's possible you
02:58 - might run into more than one mob at the
03:00 - same time if they're you know coming at
03:01 - you from two different directions but
03:03 - this will be a list of any of the ones
03:04 - that you hit so then all we have to say
03:07 - is if if hits so what this does is when
03:10 - you have a list if a list is
03:13 - empty that is false that doesn't have
03:16 - anything in it if hits has something in
03:18 - it then we're just going to set
03:21 - running equal to
03:23 - false so now anytime I hit get hit by a
03:27 - mob running will equal false the game
03:30 - will will end the game will be
03:33 - over so let's see how that works so I'm
03:35 - dodging oh I got hit I'm instantly
03:40 - dead well now that we know how to do
03:42 - collisions we can add something else
03:45 - that's going to collide on the screen
03:46 - and that is we need to be able to shoot
03:48 - so we can shoot back at these enemies
03:50 - and tell when the bullets hit the mobs
03:53 - so that we know we can delete the
03:54 - mobs so that means we're going to need
03:57 - one more Sprite okay I have my player
04:00 - Sprite I have my mob Sprite now I need
04:03 - to add a Sprite for my
04:07 - bullets and this is again going to be a
04:11 - pame
04:12 - Sprite this should all start to be
04:14 - looking pretty familiar to you um as
04:19 - we've done
04:20 - it few times
04:23 - now we'll start making these more and
04:25 - more unique as we add things to
04:28 - them
04:32 - oops and then um so for this one for
04:36 - this one's image I want this one to be
04:39 - fairly small right this is going to be
04:40 - just a little bullet that's going to
04:42 - shoot out from the front of my player so
04:48 - I'm going to make it 10 pixels wide and
04:51 - 20 pixels
04:53 - tall and I'm going to fill it with
04:57 - yellow little yellow bullet
05:01 - and we'll get the
05:04 - wreck now what about where we put it
05:08 - well we want this bullet to spawn right
05:12 - in front of the player right so if I'm
05:15 - if I'm over here on the right side of
05:17 - the screen the bullet should come out
05:18 - the front of my ship and if I'm over
05:20 - here on this side it should come out the
05:21 - front too right so so we need it to
05:24 - spawn at a different place wherever we
05:27 - happen to be when we hit the space bar
05:29 - and fired so so I'm going to add an X
05:32 - and A Y in here to the init function so
05:35 - we know whenever we spawn a bullet we'll
05:37 - just tell it spawn at a particular
05:41 - location and we'll figure that out from
05:43 - where the player
05:45 - is so we'll just set the rect do bottom
05:49 - okay equal to Y and we'll set the rect
05:52 - do Center X to
05:55 - X and then it'll be centered right on
05:58 - wherever we said to to to center it and
06:01 - then we need to oops and then we need to
06:03 - have a speed y so the bullet's going to
06:05 - travel upwards on the screen so that
06:08 - needs to be negative and we'll make it
06:10 - fairly fast um again we can tweak that
06:13 - later and decide how fast we want it to
06:15 - go and the update for this Sprite is
06:19 - going to be fairly simple the wct uh
06:23 - will move upwards at
06:25 - the
06:27 - speed and then we want to just kill it
06:32 - if it moves off
06:37 - um the top of the
06:41 - screen right you missed you didn't hit
06:43 - anything the bullet's just going to need
06:45 - to
06:45 - get um deleted so we can do that by just
06:49 - saying if the bottom of the of this
06:51 - Sprite bullet Sprite goes off the top of
06:54 - the screen then self. kill kill is a
06:58 - command that takes any Sprite and just
07:02 - deletes it removes it from any groups
07:03 - that it might be in um so it's just
07:06 - completely gone okay and so that will be
07:09 - our that will be our
07:11 - bullet um now we need a way to shoot so
07:15 - we we're going to need another key so
07:17 - we're going to do that initially to keep
07:20 - things simple we're just going to make
07:21 - it so that each time you press the space
07:23 - bar the player will shoot a
07:27 - bullet um so we're going to need to add
07:29 - another event in here in our event
07:31 - section and the event we're going to
07:34 - add is a key down
07:38 - event okay key down means a key was
07:42 - pressed downwards onto the keyboard um
07:45 - there are also key up events for when
07:47 - you let go and the key goes back up but
07:49 - we want to fire anytime you press the
07:50 - the space bar down so if so if there's a
07:54 - key down
07:55 - event and the key that was pressed was
07:59 - py game. kpace that's the name of the
08:03 - space bar then I'm going to say player.
08:07 - shoot okay now obviously we don't want
08:10 - to run this because if we do pressing
08:13 - space is going to result in an error
08:15 - because the player doesn't have anything
08:18 - called Shoot the player doesn't have a a
08:21 - function called Shoot defined yet so
08:23 - we're going to add that now now that we
08:26 - can spawn a bullet we will add a shoot
08:28 - command that spawn the bullet
08:31 - anytime we press
08:33 - space so let's say
08:36 - shoot and shoot is going to spawn a new
08:38 - bullet in this new
08:41 - bullet we just need to tell it where to
08:44 - spawn well we're going to spawn at the
08:46 - the X we're going to spawn at is the
08:48 - center X of the player so it's centered
08:52 - on the player and the Y remember we said
08:55 - to put the bottom of the bullet at some
08:59 - y so the Y will say is the self. re.
09:02 - toop of the player so put the bottom of
09:03 - the bullet at the top of the
09:06 - player okay make sure we
09:11 - add the bullet to the all sprite's list
09:13 - so that it will get drawn and and
09:15 - updated and then also just like we did
09:18 - with the mobs we're going to make a
09:20 - group called bullets and we're going to
09:23 - put this bullet in that group okay kind
09:27 - of for the same reason we did with the
09:28 - mob we needed to have a group for it to
09:30 - be in so that we could do the
09:32 - Collision okay so I'm going to scroll
09:34 - down here and add another group called
09:40 - bullets and that's a Sprite group okay
09:43 - so now if I run it I should be able to
09:45 - hit the space bar and spawn some bullets
09:49 - oops looks like I forgot to add yellow
09:52 - up here in my colors I thought I had
09:55 - done that already but I guess I left
09:56 - that one out so yellow
10:00 - I like yellow for bullets yellow is just
10:03 - 255 255
10:07 - Z all right now I've got some bullets
10:10 - and if I tap the space bar fast I can
10:11 - fire a bunch right slowly I get a few
10:15 - okay now I still have to dodge or else
10:17 - I'm GNA hit one and get
10:22 - killed okay we're almost there now just
10:25 - like we checked to see if the mob hit
10:27 - the player we're also Al going to add
10:30 - right here a check to see if a
10:34 - bullet hit a mob okay and this one is a
10:39 - little different because we have a group
10:40 - of bullets and we have a group of
10:43 - mobs and any of those bullets might hit
10:46 - any of those mobs so we want I want a
10:49 - list of all those collisions so this
10:52 - command we're going to make hits equal
10:55 - to pygame Dos
10:57 - sprite. group collide
11:00 - and that command lets you Collide two
11:02 - different groups together right this
11:04 - other one Sprite Collide was Collide a
11:06 - Sprite with a group this one is going to
11:09 - take two groups so we're going to take
11:11 - the mob's group and the bullets group
11:13 - and see if any of them hit okay and then
11:16 - I want to put
11:18 - true so that any mob that gets hit gets
11:21 - deleted and I'm going to put true again
11:24 - which is for the second group any of the
11:26 - bullets that gets hit gets deleted so if
11:29 - a bullet runs into a mob both of them
11:31 - will get deleted okay and that will be
11:37 - fine although what will happen is we'll
11:40 - start running it is see I'm killing the
11:44 - bullets right or I'm killing the Mobs
11:45 - with the bullets but now there's no more
11:47 - mobs because I have deleted all of
11:49 - them so we need to if any mobs get
11:53 - destroyed make sure we spawn some
11:55 - more and that's easy enough because
11:58 - right we we have this we had eight of
12:00 - them originally right we put them all in
12:02 - the group so anytime we delete one so
12:06 - we're going to say for hit in hits right
12:09 - there might be more than one I might
12:10 - have killed two mobs or three so however
12:13 - many disappeared I'm going to make this
12:15 - lip Loop go through this list of hits
12:17 - and do do this however many times there
12:20 - were I'm just going to spawn a new mob
12:22 - real quick add it to the all
12:25 - Sprites uh where it's supposed to be and
12:28 - add it to the mobs um where it's also
12:32 - supposed to be okay so if I killed three
12:35 - mobs then this Loop will go through
12:38 - three times and spawn three more new
12:39 - ones so I'll basically always have eight
12:42 - of them right and now I can sort of run
12:45 - along and be hitting them and they keep
12:47 - coming and now we sort of start to have
12:51 - a game right I can defend myself and if
12:55 - I mess up and miss
12:57 - one it's game
13:02 - over okay that'll do it for this time
13:04 - around uh next time I think we'll be
13:08 - ready to replace these little red and
13:11 - green rectangles with some real
13:26 - graphics
