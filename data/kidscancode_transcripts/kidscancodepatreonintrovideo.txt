00:00 - hi I'm Chris Bradfield founder of kids
00:02 - Canan code since we started two years
00:04 - ago I've taught hundreds of kids how to
00:06 - code in workshops after school classes
00:08 - and summer camps at all levels from
00:10 - beginner to Advanced I truly believe
00:13 - that computer programming is a valuable
00:14 - skill that every child should have the
00:16 - opportunity to learn it teaches
00:18 - important problem solving and critical
00:19 - thinking skills and it's a lot of fun at
00:21 - the same time in order to make the
00:23 - curriculum I've created more widely
00:25 - available I've decided to start a
00:27 - YouTube series of lessons we're starting
00:29 - with the basics but the ultimate goal is
00:30 - that these lessons will grow to cover
00:32 - all kinds of intermediate and advanced
00:34 - level topics that will allow kids to
00:35 - continue to expand their knowledge more
00:38 - importantly these videos will all be
00:40 - free available to all students
00:41 - regardless of their resources to help
00:43 - make this all happen I've created a
00:45 - patreon campaign you can see the link
00:47 - below in the notes what is patreon
00:50 - patreon is a way to support content
00:51 - creators similar to Kickstarter or
00:53 - Indiegogo the difference is that those
00:55 - sites are more about one-time events or
00:57 - single projects while patreon is more
00:59 - about about long-term support for
01:01 - creators you just choose an amount to
01:03 - contribute per video and also set a
01:05 - maximum so you'll always know exactly
01:07 - how much you're contributing the video
01:09 - series will always be free for everyone
01:11 - each month I'll be releasing a new set
01:13 - of lessons and patreon contributors will
01:15 - get first access to them along with the
01:17 - lessons will be the accompanying code
01:19 - files covering the examples from the
01:20 - lesson and suggestions for students to
01:22 - practice and expand on them patrons will
01:24 - also be able to vote on and make
01:26 - suggestions for future lessons by
01:28 - contributing on patreon your help me to
01:30 - devote the time and resources to create
01:32 - more videos and content thanks for
01:34 - watching and I hope that you'll help
01:35 - support me in teaching more kids to
01:44 - code
