00:00 - welcome back to the no 101 this is part
00:02 - eight and in this installment we'll be
00:05 - talking about two of my favorite node
00:06 - types ended oh very simple but massively
00:09 - useful nodes between and the timer so
00:12 - let's get started so we have our player
00:14 - moving around and when we touch the gems
00:18 - they just vanish and now we'd like to
00:20 - add some visual effect to picking up to
00:24 - make it look a little nicer when we bump
00:26 - into the gem to do this we're going to
00:29 - use a new node type called a tween what
00:36 - is a tween tweening is also sometimes
00:40 - called easing and this webpage easing
00:43 - dotnet is a great one to see examples of
00:47 - all the different kind of easing
00:47 - functions you can use and so what we
00:51 - mean by is easing is how we're going to
00:53 - get from a start position to an end
00:54 - position over time and instead of using
00:57 - this you know playing linear function
01:00 - there's lots of different functions you
01:02 - can use and you can hover over here and
01:05 - you can see the animation of how the
01:08 - effect works when the little red arrow
01:12 - moves from the start to the end and when
01:16 - you're doing tweening
01:17 - or easing you basically have two choices
01:19 - to make one is which function you're
01:22 - going to use so for example this is the
01:24 - sine function this is the cubic function
01:27 - and there's also two different ones all
01:31 - right
01:31 - bounce is one of my favorites but then
01:34 - you also need to choose what direction
01:37 - you're going to apply it in in means
01:40 - you're going to apply it at the
01:41 - beginning out means you're going to
01:43 - apply it towards the end and then you
01:45 - can also do in out and have it apply at
01:47 - both ends of the curve and by choosing
01:50 - different functions the back function is
01:54 - really good one - lets you go a little
01:55 - bit past the starting or the ending
01:57 - point and then come back you're going to
01:59 - choose which function you're going to
02:00 - use and you're going to choose in what
02:03 - directions you're going to apply it
02:08 - okay so we're going to take our tween
02:10 - here and I'm going to just call this the
02:13 - effect we're going to use that to apply
02:16 - several different effects to our gym
02:18 - when it gets picked up let's go over to
02:21 - our script here and we're going to we're
02:25 - going to get a handle to that to that
02:29 - node so that we can apply it and we're
02:36 - going to apply it to the start sprite so
02:38 - I'm going to go ahead and get a handle
02:42 - to the sprite - that's what it'll be
02:48 - easy to reference and we can apply the
02:51 - effect of this tween to pretty much any
02:54 - property of the sprite you can apply it
02:57 - to not just to its location when you're
02:59 - moving things around you can apply it to
03:00 - scale you can apply it to opacity to
03:04 - color you name it you can if it has a if
03:09 - it has a numerical value you can apply a
03:11 - tween to it
03:12 - okay so what we want to do is we want to
03:16 - first tell between what property we want
03:20 - to apply it to and so to do that we're
03:23 - going to use the interpolate property
03:28 - method and that just says for some
03:33 - object so we'll say the sprite and then
03:37 - you name the property that you want to
03:39 - apply this to well we're going to go
03:42 - down here we want to apply this to the
03:43 - scale if you hover over scale you see
03:47 - the property name there is transform
03:49 - slash scale so that's the property we're
03:52 - going to say property transform scale
03:57 - and then the next two arguments you put
04:01 - in here and I'm just going to continue
04:03 - this on the next line it's going to sort
04:06 - of get kind of long is the start and end
04:09 - points so I want the scale to start at
04:12 - whatever scale it's at now right so it
04:15 - starts out the size it is and I want it
04:18 - to end up at
04:19 - a value of two so it's basically going
04:24 - to scale up to double size okay then the
04:28 - next one is you need to put what
04:31 - duration you want how long do you want
04:33 - to take it to get from one to the next
04:36 - I'm going to put 0.3 we don't want this
04:39 - to be very long and so the next two
04:42 - properties are which formula you want to
04:45 - use so we're going to use the trans quad
04:51 - one and then you want to put whether you
04:55 - want to do in or out or out right so you
04:59 - can you can do any of these we're going
05:01 - to use the ease out okay so we're going
05:06 - to transfer take the transform scale we
05:09 - start it at the size it currently is
05:12 - scale it up to 2.0 over 0.3 seconds
05:15 - using the quad function in the ease out
05:20 - Direction right now we are deleting the
05:24 - gem as soon as it's crap so we wouldn't
05:26 - have time to see this effect happen so
05:29 - we instead we want the Q free to happen
05:33 - in the pool complete so if we go to the
05:36 - node here these are the events for the
05:39 - tween and the one we want is when it's
05:42 - complete so we're going to connect that
05:44 - to script here and say on on between
05:48 - complete we're going to Q free so when
05:54 - the player grabs it you want to just say
05:57 - effect dot start so this is then defined
06:02 - when the player such as the gym the
06:05 - effects going to start and when the
06:06 - effect finishes the gym will be deleted
06:09 - so we run this there you go so see how
06:16 - it sort of scales up now our only
06:19 - problem is while that gym is scaling up
06:24 - it's still on the screen so if I move
06:25 - out of it and back into it really quick
06:27 - I can actually score it more than once
06:30 - and we don't want that so while it's
06:35 - after it's been touched and closed that
06:38 - after it's been touched and is playing
06:41 - the effect we don't want it to be
06:45 - collidable anymore so I'm just going to
06:48 - put clear shapes here that was let's
06:51 - remove the collision shapes from the
06:53 - object so it no longer will be able to
06:56 - detect any area interest okay but we can
07:01 - do better and add some more
07:03 - effectiveness so let's also make the
07:05 - sprite fade out so look over here we
07:09 - want to look at the opacity and that's
07:12 - property name is visibility
07:14 - / opacity so we want to add another
07:20 - effect interpolate property and on the
07:25 - sprite we're going to do it on
07:27 - visibility opacity and for this one
07:34 - we're going to start with 1 we're going
07:39 - to end at 0 we're also going to have it
07:42 - last point 3 and then we are going to
07:47 - use the same we use the same trans quad
07:53 - and we're going to use the same ease out
07:58 - and I recommend you and you can play
08:01 - around with these try the different
08:02 - settings and see what the effect looks
08:03 - like but I think this little look this
08:05 - one looks pretty good now when we grab
08:08 - our gems they sort of look like they are
08:12 - fading away when we grab them looks much
08:16 - much better tweens are fantastic you
08:19 - should use them pretty much everywhere
08:22 - you possibly can they always make things
08:25 - look better than just plain
08:26 - instantaneous effects so the other
08:30 - really actively useful node that we're
08:33 - going to demonstrate how to use in this
08:36 - tutorial
08:37 - is the timer nose when use that to make
08:40 - a game timer so that the player has a
08:42 - certain amount of time to cool
08:44 - to gem so our main theme we're going to
08:48 - add two new notes one is on the HUD
08:51 - we're going to add another label to
08:52 - display the time I'm just going to
08:54 - duplicate that score label node and I'm
09:00 - going to call it the time label and then
09:04 - we're also going to add as a childhood
09:06 - name a timer and timer is just a very
09:12 - simple node all it does is count down a
09:16 - certain amount of time so the timer node
09:20 - only have a few settings to worry about
09:22 - wait time is how long you want that
09:25 - timer to run for I'm going to put 30 for
09:30 - 30 seconds the one-shot checkbox is
09:35 - whether you want the timer to stop when
09:38 - it reaches zero if you leave this false
09:41 - then the time it will restart when it
09:43 - reaches zero so count down another 30
09:45 - seconds so you can have a timer that
09:47 - will make things happen every 30 seconds
09:49 - or something like that but we want this
09:51 - to be a one-shot - when the timer
09:53 - reaches countdown to zero the game is
09:55 - going to end binary star and then auto
09:58 - start is whether that timer should start
10:00 - when the node is created piping team
10:03 - starts and we're going to set that to on
10:05 - as well so now our timer is ready we
10:08 - just need to connect it up in our code
10:13 - through our main script here we're going
10:16 - to we're going to add another reference
10:19 - to our time label here so that we can
10:25 - update its stated value and then we're
10:29 - also going to add game timer is get node
10:36 - game okay so now we have our new nodes
10:42 - reference and we can set them up so we
10:44 - want the game timers going to start
10:47 - automatically when the scene starts
10:49 - because we set it to auto start so we
10:52 - don't need to start the timer but we do
10:54 - need to update its value
10:57 - here the in the label so that we can see
11:01 - a change so in our process here we can
11:05 - just update the time label and set its
11:12 - text and what we want is it has to be a
11:16 - string and we want to give you the value
11:19 - of the how much time is left on the
11:21 - timer which is going to be a
11:23 - floating-point number with a lot of
11:25 - numbers up at the decimal point so we're
11:27 - going to convert it to an integer and
11:30 - it's the game timer not yet time left
11:35 - that will show us how much time is left
11:38 - so let's run it and see what that looks
11:40 - like so there we go we see our time
11:44 - counting down now we just need to say
11:48 - what we want to do when the time runs
11:50 - out well to do that we can use the
11:55 - timeout event from the timer it's really
12:00 - the only event that timers send out
12:02 - we'll connect that to a function called
12:06 - on game timer timeout okay so for now
12:10 - what we're just going to do is when the
12:12 - game timer runs out we're just going to
12:15 - freeze the player I'm just going to say
12:18 - get node player and I'm going to set
12:21 - process the false alright process
12:25 - assault on the player then nothing will
12:27 - update now I've set my wait time to 5 on
12:31 - my game timer and just so we can see how
12:35 - that works because then the game will
12:36 - run out quickly when it reaches 0 of my
12:40 - player now is frozen and I cannot move
12:43 - so that's our game over conditions right
12:45 - you can't go collect any more gems so at
12:48 - this point it would be the perfect time
12:50 - to put you have another label here that
12:52 - says game over and really big letters
12:55 - step back to hidden at the beginning of
12:57 - the game and right here when the game
12:59 - timer runs out we set it to visible and
13:03 - then you would see the words game over
13:05 - on I'll leave that to you to do I also
13:09 - just using about other places that you
13:11 - could add a tween a perfect place would
13:15 - be maybe when you collect all of the
13:18 - gems instead of them appearing
13:20 - instantaneously make them you know
13:23 - animate moving on to the screen or
13:26 - growing from a dot into the full size
13:31 - anything like that you can make use the
13:33 - bounce function to make them drop onto
13:35 - the screen almost like they're appearing
13:37 - lots of different things you could do
13:40 - that'll do it for this video I hope you
13:43 - enjoyed it and I hope you start using
13:45 - tweens wherever you can to spice things
13:49 - up and make your games look a lot more
13:52 - appealing please do comment in the
13:55 - comment section below you have any
13:57 - requests or suggestions for thing you
14:00 - want to see in future videos and I will
14:03 - see you next time
14:12 - you
