00:00 - welcome back to our PI game game
00:02 - development series this is part four of
00:05 - our game this time we're going to be
00:08 - adding graphics to the game the first
00:14 - thing we're gonna need if we're going to
00:16 - use some graphics is we need some pretty
00:18 - graphics and if you remember our right
00:24 - demo I talked about an artist named
00:26 - Kenny who has a lot of different things
00:28 - on open game art and one of his that I
00:32 - really like is called the space shooter
00:35 - pack and I'm gonna use that for the art
00:38 - in our shmoop game this one's awesome it
00:42 - comes with a lot of different ships and
00:45 - different colors it has lasers it has
00:47 - power-ups it has all the different sized
00:51 - meteors that you can have flying around
00:53 - a lot of cool stuff and a little example
00:57 - of what it looks like right got some
01:00 - cool stuff there now you can go to open
01:05 - game art and you can download it right
01:07 - here or you can download it I've linked
01:10 - directly to it in the show notes below
01:15 - so if we look at the folder when we
01:18 - download it it's gonna be a zip file
01:20 - which when you open it up is gonna have
01:23 - all sorts of stuff in it there's a
01:25 - folder with backgrounds in it and what
01:28 - we want is this in this PNG folder and
01:31 - then the PNG folder we need three things
01:34 - we need a graphic for our players ship
01:37 - we need a graphic for our laser that
01:41 - we're gonna shoot and we need a graphic
01:43 - for our enemy now the enemy is just sort
01:48 - of the enemies are just sort of flying
01:49 - around a straight line so I'm gonna make
01:51 - these mobs that we have right now be
01:53 - some of these meteors that are in here
01:56 - and we can make some cool effects happen
02:00 - with those so what we need to do is take
02:04 - those graphics and move them over into
02:07 - our folder where our code is
02:10 - so what I've done is in my folder where
02:14 - I'm writing my code I have this IMG for
02:18 - image folder just like we did in the
02:20 - sprite example and in those I put the
02:23 - three graphics I'm gonna use the player
02:25 - ship orange is the one I chose the brown
02:30 - medium one meteor and the laser red 16
02:35 - you can feel free to use different ones
02:37 - if you want to these are just ones that
02:40 - I'm going to use so let's switch back
02:44 - over to our code and get started here
02:46 - now if you remember when we did our
02:49 - sprite example and we loaded the graphic
02:52 - we had to do a little extra work to make
02:54 - sure that the code will work on whatever
02:57 - kind of computer you're using because
03:01 - different types of computers name the
03:04 - directories different things and we'll
03:08 - make it hard for your program to find
03:10 - the graphics you're looking for if you
03:12 - don't do this the right way so from OS
03:15 - we're gonna import path okay and then
03:19 - we're gonna just set up those to a
03:21 - folder for the for the images and I'm
03:25 - just gonna call it that its path join
03:30 - the directory name of whatever file
03:33 - whatever directory were in for the file
03:36 - and then I'm just say image okay so now
03:39 - we know this variable right here will be
03:42 - equal to whatever the path is to that
03:46 - IMG directory where we have our graphics
03:50 - in the right place okay and one other
03:57 - thing that I've done is I've added one
04:02 - other file which is this one which is a
04:04 - nice large space background to use on
04:09 - the background in my window I like this
04:11 - one a little better than the ones in the
04:13 - Kenny pack so again that one's linked
04:15 - below as well and you can get this it's
04:17 - called star field dot PNG we're gonna
04:20 - make that the background of our game
04:24 - so to start with why don't we load the
04:28 - background first okay so right here
04:31 - before we start up everything we're
04:35 - gonna make a little section where we
04:37 - load all game graphics okay so we need
04:43 - to load all those images in okay
04:47 - first one we're gonna make is called the
04:49 - background and that's going to be the
04:50 - image for a background so we're gonna
04:52 - say PI game image load and in the
04:56 - parentheses we want to put the name of
04:57 - the file which we just use that join
05:00 - again and we join the image folder that
05:03 - we already figured out with the name of
05:04 - the file which is star field Jade PNG
05:08 - and then always remember to put convert
05:11 - at the end we talked about that when we
05:13 - were loading graphics the first time and
05:15 - then because we've loaded that graphic
05:19 - and we need to know how to place it
05:20 - somewhere we can make a rect for it so
05:25 - that we will have a way to locate it
05:30 - okay and all we want to do with that
05:32 - background rect is draw it first every
05:37 - time we get to our draw section down
05:39 - here the first thing we want to do is we
05:41 - want to fill we want to draw that
05:43 - background before we draw anything else
05:45 - so basically instead of this green dot
05:49 - fill okay although the screened up fill
05:52 - is kind of useful there to erase any
05:55 - extra stuff if you just happen to mess
05:56 - up and have the wrong sized background
05:59 - image that doesn't cover your screen or
06:01 - something like that
06:02 - so we want to draw that background on to
06:06 - the screen so the command for that is on
06:10 - the screen we want to blitt BL I T lit
06:14 - is kind of an old-fashioned computer
06:17 - graphics term which basically just means
06:21 - copy the pixels of one thing onto
06:25 - another thing and we want to blitt the
06:28 - background onto our screen that's what
06:32 - this all sprites draw command is
06:34 - actually doing is it's going and
06:35 - bleeding all of your
06:37 - sprites it's just taking care of that
06:40 - for you since we're doing this one
06:41 - separately we're gonna need to do it
06:43 - ourselves so we're gonna blit the
06:44 - background and the location is the
06:49 - background rect which started out up in
06:52 - the upper left hand corner and we don't
06:54 - need to move it or anything so that
06:56 - should be fine and now we should have a
06:58 - nice background like that so let's go
07:04 - ahead and load our other graphics up
07:08 - here so we're going to load the player
07:10 - image again I'm just going to use IMG as
07:13 - the abbreviation for the word image so
07:17 - image dot load we're going to do the
07:19 - path dot join again with the image
07:22 - folder and then this one is called
07:24 - player ship one underscore orange dot
07:28 - PNG kind of a long name we might want to
07:31 - go back and shorten that at some point
07:33 - although it doesn't really matter we
07:35 - only have to type it in this one time
07:36 - and then I'm gonna actually just copy
07:40 - and paste that line so that I can just
07:43 - change it and make the meteor image the
07:47 - meteor image is named meteor Brown
07:53 - underscore medium one and the bullet
08:00 - image more of a laser not a bullet but
08:06 - good enough is called laser red sixteen
08:09 - okay so those are our other three
08:13 - graphics that we wanted to load so now
08:15 - we can start changing our sprites to use
08:17 - them so let's go to the player first so
08:22 - we want to replace the green rectangle
08:25 - and get rid of that fill and image is
08:30 - now just going to be player player image
08:35 - but there's a little something we got to
08:39 - check on and that is that is pretty big
08:42 - if you did you see how big that was it's
08:46 - pretty large I think I want to make it a
08:49 - little smaller well
08:51 - again that's the size of the graphic
08:52 - that the artist is drew right so we want
08:56 - to scale it and pygame can scale things
08:58 - so we can say we can say instead of just
09:03 - loading the image we want to say pygame
09:05 - gut whoops pygame dot transform dot
09:09 - scale and that'll let us scale the
09:12 - player image okay to a new size okay and
09:17 - I'm gonna make it about 50 by 38 and the
09:24 - way I figured that out was I went over
09:29 - to my graphic and I opened it up and
09:33 - just my little graphics program and I
09:38 - looked at the size okay
09:41 - and if I look at the size it is in
09:44 - pixels 99 by 75 so I just decided I
09:50 - wanted to make it about half that so if
09:53 - we went to 50 38 is the would be the
09:57 - height let me just divide them both by 2
10:00 - just to get a size we kind of would like
10:03 - okay and now that's gonna look a little
10:05 - bit better yeah that's more the size
10:12 - that I want for my ship I still have
10:15 - room to dodge things okay now if you can
10:18 - see you can definitely see if you're
10:20 - doing this on your screen we still have
10:22 - the black rectangle around it because we
10:25 - didn't set our color key so we do need
10:31 - to say self-taught image set color key
10:34 - black so that we don't have any black
10:40 - outline around it okay so that's going
10:44 - to work for the player now let's change
10:48 - the mob I'm gonna do the basically the
10:52 - same thing although I don't think I need
10:54 - to scale that image I think we'll leave
10:56 - it the same size we're just going to use
10:58 - the meteor image and there we go
11:04 - they're all little meteors with black
11:06 - outlines so let's put set color key to
11:15 - black on those very nice very nice and
11:25 - now we can do the last one which is our
11:30 - little yellow bullets are going to
11:33 - change into being the bullet image and
11:43 - set color key to black on that and there
11:50 - we go and now we have some nice looking
11:52 - graphics with a pretty cool looking
11:55 - laser beam coming out starting to look
12:01 - fun
12:09 - now the only problem we still have and
12:12 - see if I can if you can notice this on
12:15 - my screen you might have noticed it on
12:17 - yours is did you see that
12:19 - did you see that collision it didn't
12:22 - look like the meteor was touching the
12:25 - spaceship but it still counted as a
12:28 - collision why did that happen well since
12:32 - we're already going kind of long we will
12:35 - address that in the next video but
12:37 - basically we need to look at the way the
12:39 - collisions are working and adjust our
12:42 - strategy for colliding
12:52 - you
