00:00 - hello and welcome to part 2 of the space
00:02 - rocks Godot Engine series in the last
00:04 - part you created our player ship and
00:06 - this time around we're going to make it
00:08 - shoot bullets or lasers or energy pulses
00:11 - or whatever we want to call them in the
00:12 - game there's a link below to the code
00:15 - for the previous part if you want to
00:17 - start there and follow along as well as
00:19 - the code for this part if you just want
00:21 - it to be the final result alright let's
00:23 - get started ok so we have our ship and
00:28 - it slides around and we can control it
00:31 - and that's all good eventually we're
00:33 - going to add some some more visual
00:36 - effects to our ship like a shield and
00:38 - maybe some flames coming out the back
00:41 - when you thrust that all make it look
00:43 - better particles all that kind of fun
00:46 - stuff but the next thing that I want to
00:47 - do is I want to start letting us shoot
00:51 - so we're going to add the weapons to our
00:52 - ship and what that means is we're going
00:55 - to have when you press the starter
00:58 - button a bullet is going to spawn right
01:01 - here in front of the ship and it's going
01:03 - to fly forwards in whatever direction is
01:05 - pointing really fast and then we're
01:08 - going to start a little timer and when
01:10 - that timer runs out is when you'll be
01:13 - allowed to shoot again and that's how
01:15 - we're going to be going to control the
01:16 - fire rate of our of our weapon so we can
01:19 - you know adjust that and get it just
01:21 - right and allowed to be upgraded and all
01:23 - that kind of stuff so I'm going to start
01:25 - by creating a new scene for our bullets
01:29 - and I'm going to use an area 2d for the
01:32 - bullet because this is going to be I
01:35 - just want to know when that bullet
01:36 - overlaps something it doesn't need to
01:38 - collide and down lots of things I want
01:41 - it to I just want to know when it
01:43 - overlaps something so it can be
01:44 - destroyed and so look we're going to
01:47 - call this player player bullet just in
01:51 - case we add
01:52 - enemy bullets and things like that later
01:53 - and we want them to be different that's
01:55 - what I'm going to call it you know and
01:56 - put this in the scene folder and now
02:00 - we're going to add a strike you know
02:04 - what we use sprite a lot you can see it
02:06 - shows up in the recent here you can grab
02:08 - it from there too which is nice so the
02:10 - sprite for a bullet
02:12 - is going to be from our art folder here
02:16 - we've got a bunch of different laser
02:18 - images we can choose from there's blue
02:21 - ones there's green ones there's red ones
02:23 - I'm going to pick a blue one I'm going
02:26 - to take this one right here drop that in
02:29 - the texture spot and where is our there
02:33 - we are
02:34 - grab this and look then now see what
02:40 - happened as I pulled the bullet and I
02:41 - didn't move the area too deep that's why
02:44 - we like to lock them like that alright
02:48 - so there is our bullet node we need to
02:52 - add a collision shape the collision
02:55 - shape 2d and the shape we're going to
02:59 - use for this is a capsule shape that
03:03 - will fit the size of the bullet here
03:05 - really really well remember when you're
03:08 - doing these collision shapes never use
03:11 - these scale handles around the sides it
03:14 - doesn't work with the physics it will
03:17 - either not work the way you expect it or
03:19 - not work at all you want to use the
03:21 - resize handles attached to the shape
03:24 - itself and so we're going to lengthen
03:27 - this we're going to pull this in until
03:31 - we get about the size of the bullet
03:33 - there we go alright so there is our
03:37 - bullet ready to go okay we're going to
03:41 - add a script player bullet we don't want
03:45 - this in the scenes folder I want it in
03:48 - the scripts folder player bullet create
03:52 - ends area to be these comments okay so
03:58 - what's this bullet is going to do is
04:01 - it's going to appear it's going to move
04:03 - and it's going to disappear if it
04:06 - doesn't hit anything and we don't want
04:08 - the bullets to just keep going on
04:09 - infinitely so we are definitely going to
04:16 - you're definitely going to set six
04:19 - process to true
04:23 - and then in the sixth process we are
04:26 - going to move bullets and we're going to
04:30 - move the bullet just by setting the
04:33 - position to whatever the position
04:36 - currently is plus whatever its velocity
04:40 - is times Delta and what's its philosophy
04:42 - to get me well we're going to need a
04:44 - variable for that that's going to be a
04:49 - vector too and we're also going to need
04:54 - a set of speed this is going to be what
04:57 - we can do we can export this and we'll
05:01 - set that equal to something big because
05:03 - we want the bullet to go fast all right
05:10 - now the tricky thing here is that when
05:13 - we spawn the bullet we're going to want
05:15 - it to shoot in the direction you know
05:18 - we're going to rotate it and have it
05:20 - travel in the direction that the ship is
05:22 - pointing at the time it was spawned and
05:25 - the ship is going to be moving around so
05:27 - we're going to have to pass into this
05:30 - bullet those values when we first create
05:34 - it so I'm going to make a new function
05:37 - here called
05:38 - start at and we're going to pass it a
05:41 - direction and a position so what we're
05:44 - going to tell it what directions point
05:45 - in and what position on the screen to
05:49 - start at and we're just going to set the
05:52 - rotation to that direction you can set
05:55 - the position to that position and we're
05:57 - going to set our velocity to a vector
06:00 - two of the speed rotated in that
06:08 - direction so now when we spawn the
06:10 - bullet we will just need to tell ten
06:12 - bits of players rotation and the players
06:17 - location and then the bullet will be
06:20 - spawn at that spot and we still need to
06:25 - do the time out but we're going to go
06:26 - ahead and go back over to the player and
06:28 - make sure that we can start using this
06:30 - so on the player
06:33 - we're going to be we're going to be
06:35 - instancing these three bullet seams
06:38 - right we're going to be instancing them
06:40 - and we need to we need somewhere to add
06:42 - them as a child and the problem is we
06:45 - add them as a child of the player in
06:47 - their position is going to be relative
06:49 - to the player so the bullets will sort
06:51 - of move around and spin whenever the
06:54 - player does and that is not going to be
06:56 - good that's going to look weird so we
06:58 - need a node to hold all of them and the
07:01 - perfect node to use for that is just
07:03 - plain node root one you know if a node
07:07 - has really no properties at all barely
07:11 - any properties at all and it doesn't
07:14 - have a position because if you look at
07:17 - one of the other nodes all this position
07:21 - information comes from the node 2d class
07:24 - and the node is above the 2d class right
07:27 - no duty is here node is notice the
07:31 - simplest node you could possibly have
07:32 - okay this is going to be our bullet
07:36 - container that's going to be a node to
07:41 - hold all the bullets as we spawn them we
07:43 - have lots of them flying around the
07:44 - screen so back to our player script so
07:50 - we want to be able to load that scene
07:55 - the bullet scene so that we can instance
07:57 - it now one way you can do this is you
08:00 - can you can do it like this you could
08:05 - have the bullet and we preload and then
08:08 - we go find the player bullet scene over
08:11 - here copy the path clip sound it and
08:17 - that and that would work and then we
08:18 - have bullet we would say bullet dog
08:20 - instance we want to change what scene we
08:23 - use we have to go in and edit this the
08:26 - other way we could do this is instead of
08:29 - doing it this way we can make this an
08:32 - export export variable you just need to
08:36 - tell it what type this is going to be a
08:38 - packed scene
08:41 - Bar Boulud all right and then that's
08:44 - going to show up now in our inspector
08:48 - and now here I can pick let's see that
08:52 - once I can say go pick one or I can just
08:54 - actually drag the player bullets over
08:56 - here and drop it in there because and it
08:58 - allows that because that's the right
08:59 - type you can see a little tiny image of
09:03 - our a little blue bullet there so now I
09:06 - have a reference to that bullet scene
09:08 - that I can instance and I'm also going
09:12 - to say I'm also going to get a reference
09:17 - to the bullet container so I don't have
09:20 - to say getting a get note all the time
09:28 - we know we can add it to the child
09:31 - they're added as a child to that note
09:42 - okay so now we need to shoot down here
09:45 - is our input code we're going to add one
09:48 - for the fire button input is action
09:55 - press in this case we want player shoot
10:01 - if we press the player shoot then we're
10:04 - going to shoot and I'm going to define
10:07 - that as a function so that we can put
10:08 - whatever other stuff we want in there
10:11 - and say long sheet and in the shoot
10:16 - function we're going to instance a
10:19 - bullet so let's just do bullet instance
10:28 - we're going to add it to the bullet
10:31 - container add child and then we're going
10:37 - to say B dot start app we're going to
10:40 - use our start at function which needs a
10:43 - rotation so we'll get the player's
10:46 - rotation and it needs a position so
10:50 - we're going to get positions okay and
10:57 - let's see how that works okay so a
11:03 - couple things not quite right the bullet
11:06 - is pointing in the right direction but
11:08 - it is traveling in the wrong direction
11:10 - all right so we need figure out why is
11:14 - our velocity not matching our rotation
11:16 - well it's that whole pesky 90 degree
11:20 - rotation thing again so if we go back
11:22 - over to our player bullet here our
11:25 - velocity we actually need to add 90
11:28 - degrees to that PI over 2 okay if we
11:32 - play that now now the bullet is off in
11:36 - the right direction
11:37 - okay now two problems one is we're
11:43 - shooting them out basically every frame
11:46 - right because we're holding when we hold
11:48 - the button down bolts are being produced
11:49 - every frame the other problem is that
11:52 - these bullets are now they're still
11:55 - going right
11:56 - traveling forever and when they're off
11:59 - the screen or even when they're still on
12:02 - the screen I want them to disappear
12:03 - after a certain amount of time so we
12:06 - need to put that bullet lifetime odds on
12:08 - the player bullet we need to add one
12:10 - more note and this is a super useful
12:12 - node called a timer and so we're going
12:16 - to call this the lifetime and the
12:20 - lifetime is going to determine how long
12:22 - the bullet stays alive so let's put here
12:25 - wait time here is one so that's fine we
12:29 - can leave that and then Auto starts I'm
12:32 - going to fit two on so the timer will
12:34 - start in this script starts running okay
12:39 - so starts counting one second and then
12:43 - we needed to do something when the timer
12:45 - runs out so to do that we're going to
12:47 - look at a signal so lifetime node click
12:52 - on the node here has all of these
12:54 - signals and this is the one we want the
12:56 - timeout signal we're going to connect
12:58 - that to the script on the player bullet
13:02 - node and this is going to be the
13:07 - callback function that will happen when
13:10 - it happens and it's the default name it
13:12 - usually uses is on underscore the name
13:15 - of the signal and up sign we'll just
13:18 - leave that okay on lifetime timeout
13:21 - we're going to say Q 3 Q 3 is how you
13:27 - tell a node to remove itself from the
13:29 - tree and be deleted so now if we run
13:33 - [Music]
13:34 - it's a little hard to see if it's
13:36 - working because it's going off the
13:38 - screen so let's actually go back over
13:40 - here and make this really let's make it
13:44 - really small it says 2 quarter of a
13:47 - second so that way when we run it we
13:50 - should see yes if you have the bullet
13:53 - they're stopping they're stopping when
13:56 - they reach that point so that's not how
13:58 - long they live that might be a little
13:59 - shorter than we actually want it but
14:01 - they'll show you that it's working ok
14:04 - still a few things we got to do though
14:06 - we need to set our fire rate and we also
14:09 - need to make it as a bull
14:10 - that was its funding that's flying on
14:11 - top of the player because we're using
14:13 - the players position as the start point
14:16 - I really wanted to start ahead of the
14:18 - play all right so to my players tree
14:25 - here I'm going to add a position to D
14:29 - node this is a useful node you just keep
14:33 - track of a position in space and I want
14:35 - it to be in front of the ship so I'm
14:37 - going to take the position here and I'm
14:39 - just going to move it negative 50 pixels
14:43 - now my position 2 D is out there in
14:46 - front of the ship's right and if I were
14:49 - in rotation mode and I were rotating
14:50 - ship to see it just stays right there in
14:54 - front of the ship wherever it is that's
14:55 - the spot I want the bullet to spawn not
14:58 - the ship's position ok all right so
15:03 - let's call this the muzzle that's the
15:05 - muzzle of our gun and in our script down
15:09 - here in the shoot function instead of
15:11 - getting visions of the ship we're going
15:13 - to say get node get node muzzle duck it
15:20 - close right that's the muzzles position
15:22 - is where I want to pull it to spawn now
15:25 - when we run oh where am I bullets well a
15:29 - clue might be if I point down here to
15:31 - the right
15:31 - hey there are some bullets coming why
15:33 - are they coming from up there well the
15:35 - position of this muzzle is 0 negative 50
15:40 - well that's up here 50 pixels off the
15:44 - top of the screen right so that's why
15:45 - it's spawning there when we say get
15:48 - pause of the muzzle that's the relative
15:51 - position of the mobile to its parent
15:56 - right I want the real position so I
15:59 - could put the position of the player
16:01 - plus the position of the muzzle but you
16:03 - can also just say get global pause right
16:06 - so that's the global position of the
16:08 - muzzle if I hit play now everything is
16:12 - good
16:14 - okay now the last thing we need to add
16:18 - here is that fire rate okay so to do
16:22 - this we are going to add a new mode
16:25 - called a timer so I have it here in my
16:28 - favorites timer is a very useful very
16:32 - simple node I'm going to call this the
16:35 - gun timer and you have a few settings
16:40 - here in the nodes wait time that's how
16:43 - long the timer will run let's put that
16:45 - at point five not the second and then we
16:48 - have two checkboxes here
16:51 - auto start will have the timer start
16:55 - automatically when the node starts on
17:00 - the sorry when the scene starts so it
17:01 - will continue to repeat we don't want
17:04 - that we're going to start the timer
17:06 - every time we shoot but the one we do
17:09 - want is this one one shot if this is off
17:12 - then what happens is the timer will tick
17:15 - down and when it reaches zero it will
17:18 - just start again counting down another
17:20 - loop and it will just continue going
17:23 - around and what happens is every time it
17:24 - reaches zero it sends out this timeout
17:28 - signal and you can do something with
17:29 - that timeout signal but we don't need
17:32 - that we're going to put this on one shot
17:34 - which means when we hit when we tell it
17:35 - to start it's going to count down to
17:37 - zero and then it's going to stop and
17:39 - then every time we shoot we'll so let's
17:41 - start again okay so all we need to do in
17:45 - the code is go over here and we're going
17:48 - to get a reference to it we don't have
17:51 - to take it note all the time all right
17:55 - done timer node timer and here when we
18:04 - shoot we're just going to say done
18:08 - caller start and that will start it
18:12 - counting down while it's counting down
18:15 - it hasn't reached zero yet so here in
18:18 - the player shoots what we're going to do
18:20 - is we're going to say if gun timer
18:24 - if you get time left how much time is
18:28 - left on the timer it says zero then it
18:31 - has run out so we will shoot which will
18:33 - start it again and that's all we need to
18:35 - do so good start here we can see holding
18:40 - the spacebar down I am now shooting a
18:42 - bullet every half second and if you want
18:48 - to adjust that you just can go the timer
18:51 - and put it at let's say zero point you
18:55 - and that's going to let us do faster but
19:01 - so one of our upgrades can be you know
19:03 - could either change that value of what
19:06 - we use for the gun timer okay
19:10 - so we are done with our bullets so our
19:15 - next step is going to be to get the
19:17 - asteroids going so hopefully I will see
19:19 - you in the next video and we will have
19:21 - some rocks to shoot at thanks for
19:23 - watching bye
19:31 - you
