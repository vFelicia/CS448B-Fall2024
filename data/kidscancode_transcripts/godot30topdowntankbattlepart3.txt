00:00 - welcome back this is part three of the
00:02 - Godot top-down tank battle game and in
00:05 - this installment we're gonna be making
00:07 - an enemy tank and setting it up to
00:10 - patrol around the map and aim its cannon
00:14 - at the player okay to get started I have
00:18 - made an enemy tank scene this is another
00:22 - inherited scene from the basic tank so
00:26 - I've added that and I've decided to use
00:29 - red for the tanks color and I've got the
00:33 - turret here that I've chosen from the
00:36 - spreadsheet now the way we want the
00:41 - enemy tanks to move can vary but to
00:45 - start with we go over here to the map
00:47 - I'm gonna set them up to just patrol
00:50 - around like for example I might have it
00:53 - go along this little rectangular path
00:57 - here so I wanted to drive along the road
01:00 - and to do that we're gonna use path to D
01:02 - and we'll be able to set up and draw as
01:07 - many paths to DS as we like on the map
01:11 - and then attach enemy tanks to them so
01:15 - they can follow them so let's zoom in
01:19 - here and look at the location where I
01:23 - want to draw the path up close so I
01:26 - wanted to go around this path now I'm
01:30 - gonna add a node to D container that's
01:36 - gonna be paths just to hold these all
01:39 - under there and keep them organized main
01:42 - reason is because I'm gonna draw a lot
01:44 - of them I don't want my node list to get
01:45 - too long I can collapse that list if I
01:48 - want and I'm gonna add a path to D now
01:51 - drawing a path to D hopefully you've
01:54 - done this before if you've done any of
01:56 - the other Godot tutorials I put a path
01:58 - to D in the beginner tutorial if you
02:02 - click on the plus you click and start
02:03 - placing your points now one thing I
02:06 - noticed when I was playing around with
02:08 - this is the light blue color that's used
02:12 - to draw
02:13 - the path is really hard to see against
02:17 - this road and grass background and it
02:20 - actually isn't something that's
02:22 - adjustable I went and hunted around for
02:24 - that - it's hard coded in the Godot
02:26 - source code at the moment so so what we
02:30 - can do is on the ground I'm going to
02:33 - temporarily go down to the visibility
02:36 - and I'm going to darken it just so that
02:41 - it'll be easier to see my path when I
02:43 - draw it so let's say I wanted to start
02:46 - here and I want to go to this corner I
02:50 - want to go to here to here to here here
02:59 - and then I'll click the close curve now
03:02 - I have a path going around this little
03:08 - area that my enemy tank can just patrol
03:10 - on alright let's go over to our enemy
03:14 - tank and we're gonna add a script that
03:17 - extends the tank script again and for
03:23 - that once again we need to override the
03:26 - control method so we're gonna control
03:31 - and that's going to be where we put our
03:33 - code for controlling the tank again I
03:37 - might want to do some other ways of
03:40 - enemy tanks moving so they might not
03:42 - always be they might not be always
03:46 - attached to a path followed to D so I'm
03:50 - gonna say we're gonna get the parent so
03:58 - that we can test to see if it's a path
03:59 - follow which I just remembered we need
04:02 - to add over here on our map our path to
04:05 - D needs a path follow to D child there
04:11 - we go now back over on our enemy tank so
04:14 - if parent is path follow to D
04:21 - so if the tank detects that it is
04:23 - attached to a path follow then it's
04:24 - going to do the path follow code and to
04:26 - follow a path you just have to set the
04:29 - offset of the path follow so a parent
04:32 - set offset and then we want to get my
04:39 - parent get offset we want to get the
04:44 - current offset and add whatever the
04:46 - speed times Delta is and then I'm going
04:51 - to have an else in here where we say
04:53 - other we're gonna put other movement
04:55 - code if the tank is doing another kind
05:00 - of movement so let's see what that looks
05:02 - like I set the enemy tank speed to 150
05:05 - so if I go over here doing my map and I
05:09 - stick an enemy tank as a child of the
05:13 - path fellow there it is let's put our
05:18 - let's put our grounds visibility back up
05:20 - again and let's see what it looks like
05:27 - where oh I just remembered we started
05:30 - over here where we can't see our enemy
05:34 - tank driving so we need to get over here
05:36 - to where we drew him there he is
05:43 - so he's driving along the path now of
05:47 - course one problem we have is that these
05:49 - corners are very sudden and it's gonna
05:53 - make these really sharp turns which
05:56 - don't look particularly attractive I
05:59 - don't like the 90-degree snap there so I
06:03 - want to make it look a little bit more
06:04 - natural so we're gonna alter the path a
06:07 - little bit okay so I'm going to redraw
06:10 - my path here so instead of starting at
06:13 - the corner I'm gonna actually start
06:14 - right there
06:16 - and I'm gonna go short of the corners
06:20 - and do a diagonal across the corner like
06:23 - that whenever I have a corner that I
06:25 - want to go through I'm gonna
06:33 - go across there there and to there and
06:39 - close that so now what the path looks
06:41 - like is that and actually you're got an
06:49 - extra one in there
06:51 - delete yeah okay so now I have it going
07:02 - around and that's gonna look better but
07:05 - it's still not gonna be exactly what I
07:07 - want
07:07 - actually I'll show you what it looks
07:09 - like now real quick we'll go in here and
07:12 - run the scene just so you can see oops I
07:16 - hit the enemy tank so now when it
07:24 - reaches those corners it's going to turn
07:27 - right and that's a little bit better
07:30 - still not exactly perfect right and so
07:38 - the way we're gonna improve that even
07:41 - more is by using the path to these
07:45 - control points so this button right here
07:48 - will let you select the control points
07:50 - and what control points on a curve do is
07:52 - let you round the path so see as I pull
07:56 - out there or if I pull out in this
07:57 - direction I can round it here and so I
08:00 - can take these control points and I can
08:05 - I can wrong side and I can round the
08:10 - edges so that these sharp corners will
08:16 - be a little more smooth and the tank
08:23 - will look a little more natural moving
08:26 - along these paths so I'll finish that up
08:31 - and then show you the end result
08:36 - alright here's my nice rounded smooth
08:40 - path that kind of follows the centerline
08:42 - of the road and now when I run it my
08:46 - tanks movement is going to look a lot
08:48 - nicer when it takes those turns all
09:01 - right now the other thing we have the
09:03 - other problem we have though is this
09:06 - these tanks are both kinematic bodies
09:08 - and so when that tank is moving if I get
09:11 - in front of it it can't really go right
09:14 - but now what happens is it's still
09:17 - trying to follow the path so it has now
09:19 - become offset from the path and it's
09:23 - still trying to follow it and that is
09:26 - going to be a big problem
09:28 - it looks very weird so we want to make
09:32 - sure that the path followed to D which
09:36 - is the thing that's moving around the
09:38 - path and the enemy tank keep the same
09:42 - position we want the enemy tank to keep
09:44 - on the path follow so we need to make
09:48 - sure and set our position to zero zero
09:54 - right which is relative to the parent
09:56 - all the time okay and what that's gonna
10:00 - do is if we get in the way of the tank
10:03 - I'll get over here and get in front of
10:05 - it again right it's gonna push me out of
10:09 - the way which is a nice side effect but
10:11 - it's also gonna remain locked to that
10:18 - path follow okay and for a first version
10:24 - of the tank collision that is good
10:28 - enough for me right now now the other
10:32 - thing I want this enemy tank to be able
10:33 - to do is shoot at the player so I needed
10:37 - to be able to turn its turret and point
10:40 - it at the player and shoot but I also
10:44 - don't want the enemy to have you know
10:47 - infinite range
10:49 - so we're also gonna add a visibility
10:52 - ring around the enemy tank so that it
10:56 - can only it only shoots at the player
10:58 - when the player is close enough to be
10:59 - seen so on the enemy tank we're gonna
11:03 - add an area to D and this area to D I'm
11:07 - gonna call the detect radius and that is
11:12 - going to have a collision to shape to D
11:14 - of a circle and we pull that out and we
11:20 - can make that whatever size we want
11:22 - I actually think we'll probably make it
11:24 - a variable so we can make different
11:26 - enemy tanks have different sized detect
11:31 - radiuses but that'll be what it looks
11:33 - like and then we're just going to detect
11:35 - if the player is inside of this circle
11:38 - it will be shot at so in the tank script
11:43 - we're gonna add a couple more variables
11:44 - we're going to add a afloat for turret
11:51 - speed because I want to control how
11:53 - quickly that turret can rotate to turn
11:56 - and point at the player is its if it's
11:58 - slow then the player has a chance to you
12:01 - know navigate around behind the tank and
12:05 - and keep from getting fired at if it can
12:07 - stay away from the aim of the turret and
12:12 - then we're also going to have a radius
12:17 - for the detect rate for the detect so
12:23 - that we can insert whatever we want
12:25 - there so we want to take this variable
12:29 - whatever this one is and let's let's set
12:34 - it so we have a default value to say 200
12:38 - turret speed I'm going to make it 1
12:41 - we'll see how that goes so I wanted to
12:44 - take this value and set the collision
12:48 - shapes radius to that and I want to do
12:52 - that at runtime so I'm gonna put that in
12:56 - the ready and I want to get the
12:58 - collision shape
13:01 - it's shape dot radius and set that equal
13:05 - to detect radius and if we turn on
13:10 - visible collision shapes that should let
13:11 - us go over here and see when we run it
13:14 - that we have our detect radius and
13:19 - that's a little bit on the low side I'm
13:22 - gonna actually we can leave two hundred
13:25 - as the default but I'll double it on
13:29 - this guy so that we have yeah that's
13:33 - better
13:33 - so anytime you're inside of that circle
13:36 - that's when we want this turret to turn
13:40 - to point at you but I don't want it to
13:42 - just snap to instantly pointing at you
13:45 - like ours is doing with the mouse right
13:48 - if it goes across it just instantly
13:50 - rotate 180 degrees I wanted to have a
13:54 - maximum speed that it can turn and point
13:56 - towards you so in my enemy tank I'm
13:59 - going to connect the detect radius is
14:03 - body entered and body exited signals
14:06 - body entered and body exited all right
14:16 - and so both of these will detect when a
14:18 - body enters or not now on body entered
14:21 - we're gonna say if body is the player so
14:27 - if it's the player that entered then
14:29 - we're going to set target to the body so
14:35 - now we know what node we are following
14:37 - and then when the body exits now this
14:43 - could be any body exiting so if body
14:46 - equals target target equals null so we
14:51 - want to drop the target if the target
14:56 - leaves the area so now we have our
14:58 - target we've acquired our target when
15:01 - it's inside the circle now we need to
15:02 - aim towards it all right and so we can
15:05 - use the process function for this we're
15:08 - going to if there's a target
15:13 - aim the turret so first we need to know
15:17 - what's the direction to the target
15:20 - what's our direction vector pointing
15:23 - towards the target
15:24 - well that's target global position minus
15:29 - our global position dot normalized and
15:36 - then what is the current direction well
15:41 - that I want a direction vector for what
15:42 - direction the turret is currently
15:46 - pointing well that's a unit vector
15:55 - rotated by whatever the rotation is
15:59 - actually the turrets global rotation we
16:04 - want what it is pointing to in world
16:07 - space not in body space and so the angle
16:11 - that we want to set our turret to is
16:13 - going to be a linear interpolation
16:16 - between those two directions and so we
16:21 - can say turret global rotation is equal
16:27 - to current direction so we want to start
16:30 - with the current direction use linear
16:32 - interpolate to the target direction and
16:40 - the amount we want to go is by whatever
16:43 - turret speed times Delta is and then we
16:48 - want to take the angle of that because
16:50 - that that will return a vector and so we
16:52 - want to take the angle of that vector
16:53 - and that's what our global rotation will
16:55 - be kind of a long line but there you go
17:00 - so let's run this on the map and see
17:05 - what happens when the tank sees okay see
17:08 - the tanks turret is not moving but now
17:10 - it is now if I get over here
17:13 - see how it's turning to point towards me
17:15 - let's try this from an angle where it's
17:18 - not
17:20 - pointing towards me alright so as I go
17:25 - around it's pointing at me it's pointing
17:28 - at me
17:31 - I'm only a little bit faster than this
17:34 - tank but see how it's can't quite rotate
17:38 - fast enough to keep up with me if I'm on
17:42 - the opposite side like this it rotates
17:45 - around alright and so we can change that
17:48 - turret speed to adjust that later okay
17:52 - I'm going to turn off the collision
17:55 - shapes so we can see it more naturally
18:11 - okay that's working pretty well so now
18:16 - we have our enemy tank patrols around it
18:20 - can aim towards us and we can aim
18:22 - towards it so I think you can guess what
18:25 - the next part is gonna be about we're
18:27 - gonna add some shells to fire out of our
18:31 - cannons thanks for watching and I'll see
18:34 - you next time
18:42 - you
