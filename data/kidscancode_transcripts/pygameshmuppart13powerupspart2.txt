00:00 - hey welcome back to game development PI
00:02 - game this is part 13 of our shmups game
00:05 - series and we're continuing to work on
00:08 - our power-ups the last time we added
00:14 - some power-ups that would randomly drop
00:17 - from the mobs when we shoot them and we
00:20 - have the shield powerup adding back to
00:23 - our shield when we pick it up but the
00:26 - gun powerup the little lightning bolt
00:27 - doesn't do anything right now so we're
00:30 - gonna fix that so if we look at the game
00:35 - right now when we shoot we're shooting a
00:38 - single bullet so there's a lot of
00:41 - different things we could do with the
00:42 - powerup but one of them could be that
00:44 - when we pick it up we've switched to
00:46 - firing - bullets one out of each of the
00:49 - little wing tips so we need to spawn two
00:51 - bullets when we get a gun powerup so I'm
00:58 - just gonna put here that when we pick up
00:59 - the gun powerup we're just gonna do a
01:01 - player dot powerup and then we'll be
01:04 - able to define that to be whatever we
01:06 - want it to be and that'll make it easy
01:07 - for us to customize it change it later
01:09 - if we want so we're gonna go up to the
01:12 - player so here's my player and we're
01:17 - gonna need to define that powerup now
01:19 - what does that mean well we're gonna
01:21 - need a couple of variables as well
01:22 - because I want my power level so we're
01:29 - gonna have a self dot power and that
01:31 - power level is going to start out being
01:32 - level one that's where we started
01:34 - shooting the one bullet when we pick up
01:38 - the powerup it can add one to that and
01:40 - we go up to power level two which means
01:42 - we're gonna shoot two bullets so that's
01:44 - this is what's going to determine what
01:46 - power level we're on we're also gonna
01:48 - have a power timer so that we can keep
01:51 - track of when we picked up the powerup
01:57 - so that we can drop back down to level
01:59 - one when the power when the powerup runs
02:01 - out so it's just a little timer on the
02:03 - powerup okay so we have those two and
02:07 - then we're gonna go down here I'm going
02:10 - to do it in your shoot because it's
02:11 - going to be related
02:13 - so we're gonna define power up and what
02:19 - power up is going to do is it's going to
02:24 - add 1 to the power level and it's going
02:27 - to set the power time we're gonna get
02:37 - tix and we're gonna set them so we're
02:40 - gonna set the power time so we know what
02:42 - time we powered up and now we just need
02:45 - to go to our shoot here and instead of
02:50 - instead of doing just one bullet we're
02:54 - going to do one bullet if we're on power
02:55 - level 1 and we're going to do two
02:57 - bullets if we're on power level 2 so
03:00 - this would be if self dot power equals 1
03:07 - alright we would do that stuff but if
03:14 - power level is 2 then we're gonna spawn
03:18 - 2 bullets
03:21 - okay now that means we want to set 2
03:25 - different bullets at two different
03:26 - locations so bullet and here we'll just
03:31 - copy and paste this and you're gonna see
03:33 - this is gonna be a little bit repetitive
03:35 - and we're gonna clean that up later so
03:37 - don't worry about it right now but so we
03:40 - want to take this bullet right and we
03:43 - want to spawn two of them one of them is
03:47 - going to be at the left of our player
03:54 - spray and one of them is going to be at
03:56 - the right of the player sprite and then
03:59 - where is it gonna spawn we need to spawn
04:02 - it a little lower and turns out if we
04:05 - spawn it at the center Y then it'll look
04:09 - like it's about the right spot and
04:11 - you'll see when we you'll see when we do
04:15 - it how that works so we're gonna have to
04:17 - add both of these so we're gonna add
04:20 - bullet one and bullet two to the
04:23 - appropriate groups
04:27 - okay so now for an entire level one
04:29 - we're going to do this we run parallel
04:30 - to we're going to do this now currently
04:33 - if we are on power level two and another
04:37 - lightning bolt drops we're gonna add one
04:40 - to it so we'd be on power level three we
04:43 - don't really define anything for that
04:44 - and it's up to us to decide whether we
04:47 - want to keep going up with that so I'm
04:49 - gonna just put here greater than or
04:51 - equal to so that way we don't have a
04:56 - power level that's not defined because
04:58 - otherwise we wouldn't be shooting at all
05:00 - if we were on towel three so this way we
05:02 - can just sort of stick to two for now
05:04 - okay so the only other thing we have to
05:07 - do is in our update we just need to
05:09 - check if it's time to drop back down
05:14 - because the timer has run out okay so in
05:19 - the update I'm going to do this time out
05:23 - for power-ups okay we're just gonna say
05:28 - if our power level is greater than level
05:34 - one that's when we care about dropping
05:36 - down right and we get what we get what
05:42 - time it is if that - the self dot power
05:47 - time right the less so however long it's
05:50 - been since the last time we or since we
05:53 - picked up the powerup I should say is
05:55 - greater than some power power uptime
06:00 - variable that we're gonna configure then
06:04 - your power level should drop by one and
06:08 - your power time can reset that way later
06:16 - on if we decide to have three power
06:18 - levels or four or whatever if you're on
06:21 - power level three and it's been that
06:24 - certain amount of time then you're gonna
06:26 - drop down to parallel to and you'll
06:30 - stick it to our level two for a while or
06:32 - for however long that time is okay so we
06:35 - need to define that up here our power
06:38 - our power
06:39 - time let's set that to five seconds so
06:47 - five thousand milliseconds for now okay
06:50 - now let's take a look and see what we
06:53 - see we just need to get a lightning bolt
07:01 - to drop there it is okay so now I'm
07:05 - shooting two bullets at a time and now
07:09 - if we wait for five seconds to go by we
07:11 - should see it drop that to there being
07:14 - one bullet there we go
07:18 - drop back okay
07:22 - so a couple other things to do and one I
07:24 - said I was gonna take the power up and
07:27 - speed them up and maybe I'm gonna put
07:28 - that at O let's try four or maybe even
07:32 - five I just want them to fall a bit
07:35 - faster they were going way too slow and
07:38 - then we also don't have currently a any
07:41 - kind of sound associated with picking up
07:44 - the power ups and that's a little boring
07:47 - you'd be a little more interesting if we
07:49 - could hear a little sound so I'm going
07:52 - to also add some sounds so I added a
07:56 - couple of sounds one for each of the
07:59 - power-ups so I'm gonna go to this
08:04 - section here where we're loading all of
08:05 - our game sounds and we need to load a
08:07 - couple more so I'm just gonna quickly
08:10 - duplicate that and we're gonna call this
08:12 - the shield sound and then we're also
08:15 - going to have the the power sound okay
08:21 - and this one is called
08:23 - POW for dot wave and this one is called
08:29 - v dot wave okay so we just want to play
08:32 - those whenever either those events
08:35 - happen right and so the shield powerup
08:39 - happens when we pick up the shield so we
08:41 - can just right here we power up the
08:47 - shield we play the shield sound
08:53 - when we power up the player we're gonna
08:56 - play the power sound oops power sound
09:03 - play okay let's try that out real quick
09:07 - and see how that sounds good there we go
09:25 - okay okay that's about it for basic
09:35 - power ups obviously there's a lot more
09:38 - things we could do with them the gun
09:40 - powerup could increase your fire speed
09:43 - as well as how many bullet two you do we
09:45 - could have a level three a little four
09:47 - we could even even have different types
09:49 - of gun power ups that do different
09:51 - things and combine in different ways you
09:53 - can get as complex as you want to get
09:55 - with it we could also have other
09:58 - power-ups that give us some lives back
10:01 - since we can lose lives now we could
10:03 - also have something that gives us lives
10:06 - back basically there's a lot of
10:08 - different things we could do and if we
10:10 - think about our game right now we've
10:12 - reached you know about 350 lines of code
10:16 - and we have a lot of features going on
10:18 - there's a lot of things going on you
10:20 - scroll through here there's a lot of
10:21 - code there's a lot of things to keep
10:24 - track of and remember where they are so
10:27 - this is kind of a point you reach in
10:31 - most projects where it's starting to get
10:35 - complex and as you add more things it
10:39 - starts to get complicated to keep track
10:41 - of of everything that's going on and so
10:45 - in our next video we're gonna talk about
10:47 - kind of what should we do at this point
10:50 - to deal with the complexity issue and
10:52 - how can we keep this from getting out of
10:56 - control if we keep adding more things to
10:58 - it all right now I'll see you next time
11:09 - you
