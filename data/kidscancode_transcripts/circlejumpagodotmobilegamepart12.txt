00:00 - welcome to circle jump part 12 in this
00:03 - installment we're gonna take our
00:04 - settings that we've already created to
00:07 - enable sound music and ads and we're
00:10 - going to create a save system for them
00:13 - so that when you quit the game the next
00:15 - time you run at those settings that you
00:17 - chose persist and you don't have to
00:19 - change them again every time you run the
00:21 - game all right let's get started
00:24 - the first thing we need to do is we need
00:26 - to define our settings file where we're
00:29 - gonna store the settings and we'll just
00:33 - call that settings dot Save and then we
00:37 - can define how we're going to do that so
00:41 - let's scroll down here to the bottom of
00:43 - the settings script and we're going to
00:45 - define our two functions Save Settings
00:51 - which is going to have us open the file
00:59 - open the settings file and file dot
01:06 - write mode and we're going to store
01:09 - three variables in there we're going to
01:13 - store enable sound enable music and
01:24 - enable ads and then load settings is
01:32 - just going to do the opposite
01:44 - you
01:55 - okay so we just open the file and if it
01:59 - exists and read those VARs in and I'm
02:02 - going to call self dot enable ads so
02:03 - that we will call the setter here and
02:06 - actually show or hide the ad banner as
02:10 - appropriate and then we can call in
02:13 - ready we'll call load settings and then
02:18 - we need to make sure that when we click
02:20 - set enable ads we save that and then the
02:26 - same thing over on our screens when we
02:28 - change the sound or the music value we
02:33 - need to tell settings to save them again
02:38 - and then the last problem we're gonna
02:42 - have is when the game first starts it
02:44 - loads the settings but the state of the
02:47 - buttons won't be correct it'll have the
02:50 - default texture in there so even though
02:53 - sound is off it'll be showing us the
02:55 - sound on button and so we need to in our
02:59 - register buttons when we go through and
03:01 - parse all the buttons to connect their
03:03 - press the signal we can also set the
03:06 - texture or the text appropriately so we
03:10 - need to match the button name and
03:15 - depending on which one it is set the
03:18 - right values let's give a little space
03:20 - here so if it's the ads button then
03:22 - we're going to say if enable ads is on
03:27 - then the button text should be disable
03:31 - ads otherwise it should be enable ads if
03:43 - it's the sound button then we need to
03:47 - set the button value like we did down
03:52 - here button dot texture normal is the
03:58 - enable sound setting
04:01 - and same with music all right let's try
04:09 - this out I'm gonna go into my settings
04:10 - and I'm gonna disable sound all right so
04:18 - when I play I've got no sound then I'm
04:21 - gonna quit and I'm gonna run the game
04:23 - again and now if I go into settings I
04:25 - should show sound is disabled but I can
04:29 - turn it on right if I disable the ads
04:33 - and quit when I come back in the button
04:41 - should prompt me to enable ads so now we
04:44 - can store those settings and you don't
04:46 - have to reset them every time you play
04:47 - the game the other thing I've added now
04:49 - is an about screen which you reach from
04:52 - the title screen so on the title screen
04:54 - I added a new button called about and I
04:58 - linked it up just the same way we did
04:59 - all the other buttons and in the script
05:04 - for screens that about button clicking
05:08 - that about button will take you to the
05:12 - about screen and the about screen looks
05:15 - like this so I've just added a text edit
05:22 - and a new home button at the bottom and
05:28 - if you've never used TextEdit before we
05:31 - haven't changed the settings very much
05:32 - except to enable bbcode and put the text
05:35 - in there so that you'll expand it we can
05:38 - link in an image and a couple of URLs to
05:44 - take people to the source code because I
05:47 - when people get this off the app store I
05:48 - want them to find that it's a tutorial
05:51 - game and that they can go and you know
05:54 - get the source code and see how the game
05:56 - is made and then we also have our link
05:58 - here to the license information which is
06:01 - required if you're using Godot and we've
06:04 - linked that in the source code and in
06:07 - order to get those URLs to work you just
06:10 - need to connect the meta clicked
06:14 - signal and you can see that now what
06:17 - that does is call OS dot shell open on
06:21 - whatever the URL data was and so now
06:25 - when we run the program we'll see we can
06:29 - click on the about button here comes
06:31 - that page and if you click for example
06:34 - on circle jump source it will have the
06:37 - local OS open the browser so this will
06:40 - work on the phone just as well as it
06:42 - works on the desktop this tutorial is
06:44 - part of my nugudo recipes website the
06:47 - goal is to collect all the best tips and
06:49 - lessons to help make you a better Godot
