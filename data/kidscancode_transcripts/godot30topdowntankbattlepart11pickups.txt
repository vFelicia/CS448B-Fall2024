00:00 - welcome back to part 11 of the top-down
00:02 - tank battle game in this video we're
00:05 - going to be making a pickup item that we
00:08 - can put on our map and allow us to do
00:11 - power-ups supplies things like that
00:14 - objects that we want the player to be
00:15 - able to run over and pick up all right
00:19 - let's get started so I've started out my
00:22 - pickup scene already with an area 2d and
00:25 - for the sprite I'm using this crate now
00:29 - later we're probably gonna add some
00:30 - other types of pickups and we'll extend
00:33 - it from there but I'm just gonna make
00:34 - one right now that gives the player a
00:36 - health pickup or repair since it's a
00:39 - tank and the collision shape is just a
00:42 - circle but I'm hiding that just so it
00:44 - makes a little easier to see the crate
00:45 - okay now if we add a script to this what
00:52 - we're gonna want to do in this script is
00:54 - set up the properties and connect the
00:57 - body entered signal so that we can
00:59 - detect when the player runs over this so
01:03 - let's just say for now we had the plan
01:07 - to have two different types of pickups a
01:11 - health pickup and an ammo pickup and and
01:16 - when we choose one of these we're going
01:18 - to put this in the inspector so that we
01:20 - can change it around if we want to but
01:24 - we'll make it helped by default and then
01:28 - we're also going to have a vector two
01:30 - which I'm going to use to store the
01:34 - amount the minimum and maximum amount
01:36 - that we want the pickup to randomly give
01:40 - the player so for example if if it's a
01:43 - health I wanted to give them between ten
01:45 - and twenty five health it's just easier
01:49 - to store it in a vector like this so we
01:51 - have to since we have two numbers rather
01:52 - than making two separate variables so
01:56 - that's that now we also want to connect
01:58 - to that signal now while we're at it we
02:00 - should probably set the collision we
02:02 - want the mask to be on player and later
02:07 - we can just turn off so I only care
02:10 - about the player picking these up I
02:12 - don't want if we happen to have an
02:14 - me run across it I don't want the enemy
02:15 - to pick it up and we're gonna connect
02:17 - the body entered signal and in that
02:23 - signal we're gonna depending on what the
02:26 - type is we're going to say if we were an
02:30 - item
02:31 - Scot health we're a health pickup then
02:34 - if the body has a method called heal and
02:39 - we don't have one of those yet we don't
02:41 - have a take damage so that won't work
02:43 - quite yet
02:43 - but we'll just call heal with a random
02:48 - number in that range amount X amount Y
02:54 - so now if for example the same one
03:01 - fantasy is there so and then if we have
03:05 - and if we were in ammo just gonna put
03:07 - past there right now we don't have
03:08 - anything yet and then we're also going
03:10 - to Q free so now we should be able to
03:15 - toss one of these into our map let's go
03:18 - back over to our map and I have all the
03:21 - obstacles in a node to D to organize
03:25 - them I'm going to do that to here I'm
03:27 - going to add a node to D and I'm gonna
03:31 - call this items and I'm an instance a
03:34 - pickup which I've put it in items folder
03:41 - let's grab this let's put one let's just
03:45 - put one over by the player and let's
03:49 - also instance one down here on the road
03:50 - so we can make sure that the enemy tank
03:54 - coming along doesn't pick it up so let's
03:58 - see how that looks so there it is there
04:01 - and I picked it up that's what the enemy
04:03 - come along here and see let's make sure
04:05 - we didn't mess up our yeah there we go
04:09 - the enemy goes right through it okay so
04:14 - now this picks up but it's it's really
04:16 - boring it's just sitting there and it's
04:17 - kind of hard to tell the difference
04:18 - between this crate and any other
04:21 - obstacles that you've made especially
04:24 - once we have our map all flashed out
04:26 - when we have lots and lots of stuff on
04:27 - the map
04:27 - how do we tell that that's a thing that
04:29 - we can pick up well one thing we can do
04:31 - is give it a little bit of animation to
04:34 - make it appear like something that's
04:38 - moving and and something that attracts
04:40 - the eye so you know you want to go pick
04:42 - it up and we'll do that with an
04:44 - animation player okay and my animation
04:47 - player I'm going to create a bounce
04:49 - animation I'm going to set it to auto
04:52 - play and loop and what I want this to do
04:56 - is change the position of the sprite so
04:59 - I click on the sprite here and we're
05:03 - gonna add a keyframe for the position so
05:07 - I'll create the track and I'm going to
05:09 - move to about two halfway along the
05:11 - animation the length is one second so
05:13 - we're gonna move to halfway and we're
05:15 - gonna put this at minus 20 and we're
05:19 - gonna keep frame that and then we'll go
05:21 - back to zero automatically because we're
05:25 - gonna have it loop alright there's we
05:26 - have that on loop so right now if we did
05:28 - that it's just gonna bounce up and down
05:29 - like this which is okay but it looks a
05:32 - little artificial you can smooth that
05:35 - out a little bit by clicking on the on
05:38 - one of the keyframes and then clicking
05:42 - this button right here and that lets you
05:45 - edit the key and what you can do is
05:47 - change the transition and you can change
05:50 - this curve around a lot I encourage you
05:52 - to play around with it I like to do for
05:55 - this one I'm gonna do just a slight sine
05:59 - curve and I'm gonna do it on both
06:01 - keyframes about the same round 1.5 or so
06:06 - so just a little bit and then oh I hit
06:10 - stop here so then we can see it's a
06:12 - little smoother right so when it's on
06:13 - the screen it's going to be bouncing up
06:15 - and down like that if we look at it in
06:19 - the map we can see what that looks like
06:21 - so there's our bouncing crate alright we
06:27 - can still pick it up but we can do even
06:29 - better and make it look look a little
06:30 - nicer still and we'll do that by adding
06:33 - a shadow if we drop that in the texture
06:37 - you'll see it's a little bit too big so
06:39 - we're gonna scale it down and we also
06:40 - need to move it down so
06:41 - below the sprite itself so I'm gonna
06:44 - move it down about 20 pixels or so and
06:52 - I'm going to change the scale and we
06:55 - want to make it a lot thinner narrower
06:59 - and thinner so the Y may be 0.5 and the
07:05 - X may be point 3 to 5 okay and I think
07:20 - well maybe we'll move it down a little
07:21 - bit further okay and so what we want
07:25 - this shadow to do is we're going to
07:29 - scale it down even a little bit more as
07:31 - you as the cube rises up and down and
07:35 - then we're also going to fade it out
07:37 - just a little bit so we're going to
07:38 - change its scale we're gonna animate its
07:40 - scale and it's modulate alright so let's
07:43 - take the shadows scale and we're gonna
07:45 - start with it the size it is now and at
07:49 - the halfway point when the box is at its
07:52 - highest we're gonna shrink it down and I
07:56 - want it to be proportional so I'm going
07:57 - to use the same amount I'm just gonna
07:58 - divide by 1.5 which is gonna give me
08:02 - about it's gonna give me two thirds of
08:05 - the size and then we'll just keyframe
08:09 - that and now we'll have a nice shrinking
08:15 - shadow and now I want to play with the
08:18 - opacity a little bit because it's way
08:20 - too dark so again at the front we're
08:23 - gonna start with the shadows modulate
08:26 - and I'm gonna put the alpha just a
08:29 - little bit above half and I'm gonna
08:32 - keyframe that and then at the end I'm
08:37 - gonna drop it to just a little below
08:40 - half maybe a third and I make you frame
08:46 - that and that way we have a nice fading
08:51 - shadow
08:52 - okay and in our main scene that's gonna
08:55 - look a lot nicer we have a nice little
08:59 - shadow on our box now the remaining
09:02 - thing is I want to be able to indicate
09:05 - what kind of pickup this is so when the
09:08 - player sees this box how are they gonna
09:11 - know whether it's a health pickup or an
09:13 - ammo pickup or some other kind of pickup
09:15 - that we do later a big bonuses or
09:17 - equipment who knows what so we need some
09:19 - sort of symbol telling us what kind of
09:22 - crate it is so we're going to add one
09:26 - more sprite here and this one is going
09:30 - to be we're gonna call this the icon and
09:33 - this one is going to use in the assets
09:39 - folder this wrench image that I have and
09:43 - we're going to take that we're going to
09:46 - put it let's see we're gonna shrink it
09:49 - down a little bit like that and then
09:53 - we're gonna move it up say yeah up above
10:01 - the crate and then we're going to
10:04 - animate some of that too so I'm going to
10:08 - animate this scale to have it change
10:13 - size and I'm also going to animate the
10:14 - transparency so that it will give a
10:16 - little pulsing effect so we're gonna
10:19 - take this and we're going to keyframe
10:22 - the scale and at the end we're gonna go
10:27 - down to half the size keyframe that and
10:36 - then we're going to fade it out and I'm
10:41 - not spending a lot of time on this
10:43 - because I might you know down the road
10:48 - do some particle are some shader effects
10:51 - for these some of these things I don't
10:54 - want to really get into that and yet but
10:56 - for right now we can get pretty far with
11:00 - some simple little effects like this
11:03 - that at least give us an idea of what
11:04 - kind of thing we're going for
11:06 - accident flashes like that and then we
11:10 - can separately if we want set the color
11:13 - so that we could have color means
11:14 - something to I'm just gonna use the
11:16 - modulate and set it to like a bright
11:18 - green and let's see what that looks like
11:21 - on the map alright so visibility is a
11:27 - little low so it might not mean to pick
11:31 - that green color so I'll make it a
11:34 - little brighter yeah I think that'll be
11:37 - alright so so now I have this little
11:40 - pulsing icon in the pickup script
11:43 - we're already telling it to heal the
11:45 - body if the body knows how to be healed
11:48 - so we need to add a method for that to
11:50 - the tank script so we'll go to the tanks
11:54 - grip we already have the take damage so
11:57 - we will add heal some amount and so that
12:05 - will increase our health by whatever
12:10 - amount it's going to emit the same
12:13 - health change to signal so that we
12:15 - update the bar and then we need to make
12:20 - sure we clamp the health so it doesn't
12:23 - go above our max health and so I better
12:31 - do that before I you met the signal or
12:34 - element the signal with a bad value okay
12:37 - so now we have our player should be able
12:41 - to heal so if we go over to our map okay
12:46 - I'll run up here and take a couple of
12:49 - hits okay and then we'll go grab the
12:52 - crate and there are health went back up
12:55 - okay so now we have our pickups working
12:59 - the way we want we can't really do
13:00 - anything with the ammo pickups yet
13:02 - because we haven't added ammo to the
13:04 - tanks or quite yet decided there's a
13:07 - couple different ways we could do ammo
13:08 - and how we want to handle that but that
13:11 - will have to wait for a future video I
13:14 - hope you enjoyed it please leave your
13:16 - comments and questions below and I'll
13:18 - see you in the next
13:19 - video
13:27 - you
