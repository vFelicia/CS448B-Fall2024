00:00 - okay welcome back this is part 7 of
00:02 - space rocks the video engine game
00:04 - tutorial where we make a slow asteroid
00:06 - style game in this part we're going to
00:08 - work on the players shield so that we
00:10 - can have something happen when the
00:11 - asteroids hit them plus a few other
00:13 - tweaks and improvements buddy let's get
00:15 - started okay so it's time to start
00:18 - making these asteroids do something when
00:21 - they run into the ship so we can go to
00:23 - the player here the player is an area 2d
00:26 - so in the signals it has an a body enter
00:31 - signal and we're going to connect that
00:33 - to our script and so that's going to
00:38 - tell it to body that enters and right
00:40 - now we're talking about the asteroids
00:42 - but you know other bodies might be on
00:45 - the screen at some point so we're going
00:48 - to say if bodies get groups have
00:55 - asteroids so if it's in the asteroids
00:58 - group let's just test this out by
01:01 - printing the body dot get name just to
01:06 - make sure things are working now what we
01:11 - should be able to do is go fly on top of
01:13 - this asteroid and see its name print
01:17 - right so we're detecting a collision and
01:21 - we just need to decide what to do well
01:24 - probably we want that to explode and we
01:29 - want the player to take some damage or
01:30 - play your shield to take some damage so
01:33 - we're going to have some variable period
01:35 - for the shield level right and that can
01:40 - start out at some value and then I'm
01:42 - also going to have whether the shield is
01:46 - up or not like when they it's a shield
01:49 - it's completely not done to the other
01:50 - shields going to go down and now the
01:51 - play is going to be vulnerable
01:53 - so the shield level is that and then
01:57 - we're going to take away some damage
01:59 - when the asteroid hits it but it's not
02:04 - really very visible because we're going
02:08 - to need to display that shield we're
02:11 - also going to want to set how much
02:12 - damage the
02:13 - individual asteroids do based on their
02:15 - size so one thing we can do over here
02:20 - and asteroid week or sorry in name right
02:23 - we have the things like the pattern that
02:26 - didn't break up into right we're also
02:28 - going to have you know the individual
02:31 - asteroid sizes give you different amount
02:33 - of points when you shoot them give you a
02:35 - different amount of damage when they hit
02:38 - you and all those things are like
02:41 - settings that you want to be able to
02:43 - make that globally affect the whole game
02:46 - and so what I'm going to do then to make
02:49 - a new script just to hold all those type
02:53 - of things there's going to make a new
02:55 - script it can be a good inherit from
02:58 - node that's fine make put this in
03:01 - scripts and this is going to be global
03:04 - Gd and so what we can do is if we go
03:12 - into the project settings auto load and
03:16 - we choose that script and say add okay
03:23 - so it will be named global and it is a
03:26 - singleton which means it's going to be
03:29 - one one instance of this script I go
03:33 - script object will exist in every scene
03:36 - so everything will be able to access the
03:39 - things that are in it and we don't even
03:44 - need the ready function at the moment
03:45 - but we what we're going to do is just
03:47 - put some variables in here so the global
03:51 - game settings things like let us not a
03:55 - comment for our game over night weather
03:59 - when we gain dependent or not we're
04:02 - going to have a score we're going to
04:05 - have a level alright every time you
04:08 - clear the screen we're going to have
04:10 - maybe some other stuff we'll get to
04:12 - later and on the player we're going to
04:16 - have things like the next shield level
04:23 - and we know how fat how far up that can
04:25 - go and I'm also going to have a
04:27 - regeneration right this is going to be
04:30 - every pick how many and shield you get
04:36 - back so your shield does regenerate if
04:38 - you can avoid getting hit and then there
04:42 - are some also some asteroid settings and
04:44 - asteroid that's where we're going to
04:47 - want things like this if we grab this
04:52 - I'm going to put that into global and
04:57 - then we're also going to duplicate that
05:06 - we're going to have a damage how much
05:16 - damage the asteroids do okay I skipped
05:18 - over the formatting but now I have an
05:21 - asteroid damage and asteroid points and
05:23 - this is going to be how much those
05:26 - values are which we can obviously just
05:28 - later
05:29 - welcome stuff in there but now on our
05:31 - main we have a problem right because we
05:34 - removed that break pattern now we just
05:38 - need to put global in front of it and
05:42 - everything should work just fine don't
05:47 - shoot it there we go okay and now we can
05:52 - use those in our player so our shield
05:55 - level is going to be equal to whatever
05:59 - shield max was and you can see the auto
06:04 - auto correct and inside the autocomplete
06:06 - to use the global so it knows what
06:08 - variables we've declared in there so now
06:13 - we can go down here and do something
06:16 - with the asteroids when we hit them so
06:21 - what we're going to do is we're going to
06:22 - say if pick the shield is up then we're
06:28 - going to say body dot explode we already
06:32 - have that
06:34 - function on the asteroids window when
06:37 - they bullet hit them so when the body
06:39 - does explode the players velocity as the
06:44 - impacting body and then we're just going
06:46 - to say shield level during a subtract
06:49 - global dot extra damage body dot size so
06:56 - you know what's I doing and if the
06:58 - shield isn't up we're going to set game
07:02 - over to false but that won't do anything
07:04 - yet now again we're not going to see any
07:09 - of this stuff happen so let's just print
07:11 - out sea level to make sure it is
07:15 - subtracting exactly so I should be able
07:20 - to go running to this and is going off
07:22 - the screen when I want to hit them all
07:23 - right so you're not careful you're going
07:27 - to hit multiple ones because they're
07:29 - going to come flying out off of the ship
07:33 - when you hit them especially the big
07:37 - ones are going to be super dangerous to
07:39 - hit okay there's a four speed yeah okay
07:48 - so that's working so now let's just get
07:51 - rid of that print and we want to talk
07:54 - about displaying our shield on the
07:57 - screen using some kind of progress bar
08:02 - yeah that will get shorter as we the
08:04 - shield and so what we're going to do is
08:07 - I'm going to go so I'm going to make
08:09 - this as a new scene then they can move
08:11 - scene and this is going to use this is
08:18 - going to use down here at the bottom to
08:22 - show you where it is a canvas layer and
08:27 - Candice layer lets you make a layer
08:32 - that'll be drawn in a certain order so
08:35 - for example the the main scene it's
08:38 - going to be on the layer zero so
08:40 - anything that's drawn on the canvas
08:41 - layer would be on top of it and
08:44 - the perfect way to do your heads-up
08:47 - display so that's what we're going to
08:48 - call this is the HUD and so this is
08:51 - going to contain all of our information
08:55 - like the she'll of the score messages we
09:00 - want to give the player anything like
09:01 - that so in here let's put a couple of
09:05 - things we're going to put a label that's
09:09 - going to hold the score and for the
09:12 - shield bar under control there are all
09:15 - sorts of great GUI related node like the
09:21 - one that we're going to use is right
09:25 - down here textured progress and that
09:27 - lets you make a progress bar using a
09:29 - texture who's going to be the shield by
09:35 - okay now we need to configure this we
09:37 - need some textures to put in it you can
09:40 - see it has a progress texture that will
09:43 - be the texture that it will show some
09:45 - fraction of between zero and a hundred
09:48 - percent and then under and over let you
09:52 - put something underneath and over top of
09:54 - it to give it some more visual appeal
09:56 - but we want to start out with what
10:00 - graphic we want to use all right well
10:03 - our old friend Kenny has also made a
10:05 - great GUI pack looks like this that has
10:09 - all the bits to make all these great
10:11 - little progress bars and and dialog
10:15 - boxes and everything and this is all the
10:20 - pieces that are in it I really like
10:24 - these little glass looking transparent
10:27 - panels I'm going to use those too and so
10:30 - I've put those all here in the GUI
10:32 - folder under art and all the pieces are
10:35 - in here and here is our nice green
10:40 - horizontal bar that's what we're going
10:42 - to use for the progress and then here
10:48 - let's say the minimum value is zero the
10:51 - maximum value is 100 and the current
10:53 - value is let's say we're at 75 and there
10:56 - you see
10:58 - how it changes the queer at 25% etc
11:02 - right and so that's how we'll that's how
11:06 - we'll do that when we just need to put
11:08 - it in the right place now I'm going to
11:10 - use that using the using the anchor
11:16 - properties of the control node now I'm
11:20 - not going to go too much into how these
11:21 - anchors work that'll have to be for
11:23 - another video but I'm just going to go
11:25 - down here and set the margins here left
11:28 - I'm going to set to 30 that's 30 pixels
11:31 - from the left top I'm going to set to 10
11:36 - 10 pixels down the right value is going
11:42 - to be 230 and the bottom value is going
11:49 - to be 48 left fine so that's where we
11:51 - want it it's up in the corner but not
11:54 - right up against the top okay and then
11:59 - while we're at it let's get the score
12:01 - going in the score I want it to be
12:04 - centered on the screen so you left and
12:07 - right
12:07 - anchors I'm going to make them relative
12:10 - to the center and skipping down to the
12:14 - margins I've just gone ahead and filled
12:16 - them in 200 pixels to the left and right
12:19 - of center and we value let's just put 0
12:25 - in there I want that to be centered I
12:29 - want that to be Center aligned and I
12:32 - don't want to use the default ugly font
12:35 - so I have gone in here and we're going
12:38 - to say new dynamic font goes over here
12:42 - and we're for thought we're going to
12:44 - load and I am a fox folder where I've
12:47 - got a canny font I'm going to set the
12:53 - font size to about 48 and there we go
12:57 - now I have a nice score display up there
13:01 - at the center and that is good enough
13:04 - for now
13:06 - so in the main we just have to add an
13:09 - instance of that hug team and because
13:13 - it's a canvas layer it's going to be on
13:15 - top even though it's down here at the
13:17 - bottom of the list you can you you're
13:19 - welcome to put it you know up higher mo
13:24 - or doesn't matter
13:25 - because it uses that property now to our
13:30 - main script hearing process we can say
13:34 - HUD get node all right you can actually
13:39 - see them coming up right so shield bar
13:42 - you could just set value to be players
13:50 - field level right now the thing is let's
13:55 - just try that for the moment I'm going
13:57 - to do this a different way but get node
13:59 - player dot shield level right and that's
14:06 - going to work fine if we try this out if
14:10 - I go run into this guy now look at that
14:14 - that went down right but what I also
14:18 - want to do is I'd like to change the
14:21 - color of it we have some we have a red
14:24 - bar and we have a yellow bar so instead
14:27 - of doing this let's make this a little
14:32 - nicer
14:33 - I'm just going to add a function called
14:36 - show hood shield
14:45 - okay and then what this is going to do
14:48 - is a couple of things first we're going
14:50 - to get the shield level from the to the
14:55 - player get the node player shield level
15:03 - and then we're going to use that to
15:06 - decide what color we want to make it and
15:08 - so the default color will be green but
15:12 - if the shield level is less than 40 in
15:17 - color is going to be red and then if the
15:22 - shield level it's not red then the
15:24 - fissure levels lessons save 70 and the
15:28 - color is going to be yellow and if you
15:33 - look at the names of the textures
15:35 - they're all the same just with the color
15:40 - name inserted there so the texture that
15:43 - we need to use is just going to be in a
15:48 - load art GUI bar horizontal underscore
16:00 - something underscore mid 200 PNG and
16:07 - then we just say percent color that'll
16:12 - insert the right thing in there and then
16:16 - we can say hug get node shield bar set
16:25 - progress texture progress texture to
16:30 - that and I'm not get node to a bar set
16:40 - value to shield level
16:45 - okay that way we can see and now we
16:48 - should be able to see it game changing
16:50 - color as it gets shorter let me shoot
16:53 - this I get some smaller ones if we run
16:57 - into this see when we got down the bear
16:59 - wear yellow get some more hits here and
17:02 - we're into the red okay much better
17:07 - while we're at it we're also going to
17:11 - stay on the score we're just going to
17:17 - set the text to whatever global dot
17:22 - score is the leniently start changing
17:29 - the score we'll see it change alright
17:32 - let's finish up our shield functionality
17:35 - here in process here we're going to say
17:40 - if the shield is up alright then we're
17:45 - going to allow you to recharge so we
17:49 - want to add whatever that reach
17:51 - regeneration rate is but we don't want
17:53 - it to go above 100 so I'm going to set
17:57 - it equal to the minimum of either a
17:59 - shield level plus mobile shield regen
18:05 - times Delta that's how much we want to
18:08 - do each frame or 100 ways you will keep
18:13 - it a macron 100 and that's going to do
18:15 - the shield regeneration but if shield
18:18 - level is less than equal to 0 and the
18:25 - shield is up then we want to set shield
18:29 - up to false because we have now lost our
18:34 - shield to level 0 and we'll say get node
18:41 - shield
18:44 - hide this shield will disappear so let's
18:49 - try that
18:56 - okay see my shield bar regenerating okay
19:01 - like a whole bunch of hip it's going to
19:03 - go down below and you're going to have a
19:08 - problem let me get let's get some big
19:11 - ones back on here and we'll see if we
19:14 - can knock our shield out entirely there
19:17 - we go see now the shield has disappeared
19:20 - from around the player and game over
19:23 - would be is being set to zero but we
19:25 - haven't anything about that yet alright
19:28 - let's wrap this stuff with a couple
19:30 - other things we want to add some points
19:31 - when the asteroids get destroyed so here
19:36 - and explode we'll just say global dot
19:40 - score and we'll add the asteroid points
19:49 - for whatever size we are that's simple
19:53 - enough and then in the main I'm going to
19:56 - go here to the ready I'm going to get
19:59 - rid of this one that responding at the
20:02 - beginning and what we're going to say
20:05 - here is that if the asteroid container
20:07 - is empty we're going to add one to level
20:12 - global level plus equals one and we're
20:19 - just going to count for I in range level
20:22 - and spawn that name so every time we go
20:25 - up a level we'll just get one more
20:28 - asteroid and that should do it
20:34 - its global dot well
20:41 - I should be able to get some points over
20:47 - here by shooting asteroid all right nice
20:55 - we have our score and our shield working
20:59 - that's a good day's work
21:02 - okay as always thanks for watching I
21:04 - hope you're enjoying making this as much
