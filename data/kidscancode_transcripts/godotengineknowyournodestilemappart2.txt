00:00 - welcome back to another know your nodes
00:01 - Godot game engine video in this lesson
00:05 - we're going to be looking at tile Maps
00:07 - again
00:08 - this time we're going to be talking
00:09 - about how to interact with the tile map
00:12 - from your code so that you can query and
00:17 - modify the tile map during the game in
00:20 - the previous video we showed how to use
00:22 - the tile map node to set up our map for
00:26 - the simple 2d platformer example we also
00:30 - showed how to do a top-down map and in
00:33 - this video we're going to look at how to
00:34 - use GD script to interact with this map
00:37 - during the game here's the tile map node
00:40 - documentation and you can see there's
00:43 - lots of methods for interacting with the
00:47 - tile map and setting and getting various
00:50 - settings for the individual tiles as
00:52 - well as the tile map as a whole one of
00:54 - the ones that you're going to use the
00:56 - most or the most often is going to be
00:59 - this world 2 map method this lets you
01:03 - convert from screen coordinates and
01:05 - pixels to map coordinates on the tile
01:08 - map grid so here's our script and what
01:11 - this script is going to do is detect
01:13 - amount left mouse click and display the
01:15 - global mouse position it's going to look
01:18 - like this so whenever I click appear
01:22 - it's showing me the pixel coordinates
01:25 - where on the screen
01:26 - I clicked and what I want to know is
01:29 - what are the tile coordinates on the
01:31 - tile map of that click location so now
01:36 - to get that tile coordinate we are just
01:37 - going to use the map world to map method
01:42 - and we're going to pass it the mouse
01:44 - pause and that's it so now when we run
01:48 - it we will see when I click up here in
01:50 - the corner
01:51 - that's tile zero zero and anywhere I
01:54 - click on the screen I'm now finding out
01:56 - what my tile position is on the top map
02:00 - now that we know what tile we've clicked
02:03 - on let's say we want to change the tile
02:05 - that's there so we can use map set cell
02:10 - and then you give it an X and a Y
02:13 - and what tile you want to do so let's
02:18 - say I do tile number five and what that
02:22 - means is anywhere I click I'm going to
02:25 - place a tile number five they're still
02:31 - there if you want a tile to be removed
02:35 - negative one means no tile at that
02:38 - location so that's how you can remove
02:42 - tiles from the map when you click as
02:44 - well
02:46 - now it's also useful there is a set cell
02:49 - there's also a set cell V so tell V lets
02:52 - you pass a vector instead of individual
02:54 - X and Y's which means we could just say
02:56 - that which is a little bit more
02:58 - convenient now let's say instead of the
03:01 - mouse
03:01 - I want to detect which tile the player
03:04 - collides with well on the player script
03:07 - if we go over to the player script and
03:10 - we put something like if is colliding
03:15 - print and we're just going to print out
03:18 - get Collider get name so you can see
03:22 - what we're colliding with and if we do
03:25 - that you'll see it's printing up map 1
03:28 - so what happens is the collision
03:32 - detection doesn't see the individual
03:35 - tiles because they're part of the top
03:37 - map and because it's more efficient this
03:39 - way you just collide with the map object
03:43 - wherever you collide so let's look at
03:46 - how we would do that on the player I'm
03:49 - just going to create a signal called hit
03:52 - it's going to emit a position and then
03:56 - if we do collide we're just going to
03:58 - admit that hit signal with the collision
04:01 - position and then over on our main we're
04:04 - going to connect that signal from the
04:06 - player to a function called collided and
04:10 - that collided function is just going to
04:13 - print out the world to map which means
04:17 - it should print out the tile coordinate
04:19 - of our collision so let's see how that
04:21 - looks
04:22 - there we go as I'm moving around you can
04:26 - see down there at the bottom
04:27 - it's printing out different tile
04:30 - positions so now instead of printing out
04:33 - let's do a set Selvi and take that
04:41 - position that cell and set it to
04:45 - negative one which means now whenever we
04:48 - hit a tile we're going to delete it now
04:53 - if you wanted to do something like this
04:54 - where every time you collide with the
04:58 - tile you change it to a different tile
05:00 - then you're going to get something like
05:02 - this which is fine except you want to be
05:05 - a little careful about this because
05:07 - you're going to run into some issues for
05:10 - example when I jump off this way I'm
05:12 - fine but if I go this direction I'm
05:15 - spawning another tile and that's because
05:18 - the collision position is rounding to
05:23 - the next tile because I'm technically
05:26 - hitting the tile on the side and that's
05:30 - going to lead to all sorts of problems
05:31 - especially if you start trying to jump
05:33 - and you're hitting the tile from below
05:36 - but your collision position is still in
05:39 - the current tile so you need to add some
05:42 - logic there to make sure you don't get
05:45 - stuck in some weird positions like that
05:50 - so a quick way we could solve that would
05:53 - be just to check what is in the cell
05:58 - before we replace it so we'll just use
06:01 - map get cell V and we're going to get
06:07 - this location where we are looking and
06:13 - if that tile is not is not equal to
06:19 - negative one then we'll set the cell to
06:23 - five and that way we will still change
06:26 - them when we land on them but we can't
06:28 - change any of the empty tiles into solid
06:34 - ones
06:36 - all right I hope this gives you some
06:38 - ideas how you could use tile maps in
06:40 - your projects please post your questions
06:43 - in the comments below
06:45 - there's anything you didn't understand
06:46 - I'll be happy to help you out in the
06:48 - next video we're going to do one more
06:50 - look into tile maps and this time to
06:54 - look at a couple of requested topics
06:58 - isometric tom maps and animated tiles
07:02 - thanks as always for watching and I'll
07:04 - see you in the next video
07:13 - you
