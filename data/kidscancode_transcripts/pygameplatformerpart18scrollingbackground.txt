00:00 - welcome back to game development pygame
00:02 - this is part 8 of the platformer and
00:04 - we're gonna add a little bit of visual
00:06 - appeal by creating a scrolling
00:08 - background technically not a background
00:11 - but we're gonna add some clouds alright
00:14 - our platformer is looking pretty good
00:16 - we've got some good jump inning
00:17 - happening and we've got our enemies but
00:20 - our background is kind of dull I'd like
00:23 - to add some appeal now a lot of
00:25 - platformers will have a scrolling
00:27 - background where you see some trees or
00:29 - mountains in the background going by
00:32 - behind the player we can't really do
00:35 - that or it doesn't really make sense to
00:36 - do that since we're scrolling vertically
00:37 - any nice mountains or anything that we
00:40 - have are gonna go scroll off the bottom
00:41 - and not be visible but we can jazz up
00:46 - the background a little bit by giving it
00:47 - a little more appeal with some clouds
00:51 - okay so I've got some cloud images that
00:54 - I also got from kinney game art and I'll
00:56 - link down below and we're just going to
00:59 - use those to spawn some clouds that
01:02 - we're going to show in the background
01:03 - and since we have our layers set up we
01:07 - can go over to our settings where we set
01:10 - the layers for everything and we can
01:11 - make a cloud layer that's gonna be layer
01:16 - 0 so it'll be all the way in the back
01:18 - behind everything else alright so we
01:22 - need to make a new sprite okay so we're
01:26 - gonna grab some of this code and paste
01:30 - it in here and call this a cloud now the
01:36 - clouds are just gonna spawn up above the
01:38 - top of the screen and they're gonna come
01:40 - scrolling down below it so we don't need
01:43 - to specify where they spawn but they're
01:47 - gonna use the cloud layer and they're
01:51 - going to be and the I'm gonna put them
01:54 - in the clouds group because what we're
01:59 - gonna do is we're gonna make a group for
02:00 - the cloud so that we can scroll them at
02:02 - a different speed from the speed we're
02:05 - scrolling everything else and that's
02:07 - gonna allow us to make it look like the
02:11 - clouds aren't scrolling by you
02:13 - the clouds are in the distance and we
02:15 - could even vary it a little bit okay so
02:19 - we have that our sprite also is going to
02:23 - need an image so we're gonna go to our
02:24 - again we're gonna load our cloud images
02:27 - now I have a few of them so that we can
02:33 - give it again some variety okay so this
02:37 - is for the cloud images now those are
02:43 - now I'm gonna make a list to put them in
02:46 - there happen to be named one through
02:50 - three so I'm going to count from one to
02:53 - three auto-complete I'm gonna count from
03:00 - one to three and then for each one I'm
03:02 - just going to append to the cloud images
03:08 - of an append to the cloud images the
03:13 - image that I'm going to load each image
03:16 - dot load join I put them in the image
03:22 - folder just like everything else this is
03:25 - maybe a cloud number whatever dot PNG so
03:31 - it's cloud one cloud two and cloud three
03:35 - we're just gonna insert the number there
03:37 - and then we have all of our stuff and we
03:43 - can dot convert it and then we'll have
03:47 - all of our cloud images so over here on
03:49 - our sprite we can just tell it to pick a
03:57 - we can just tell it just pick one of
03:59 - those randomly so the image is going to
04:02 - be choice from the game cloud images
04:17 - we'll set the color key and we will
04:23 - create the rect sorry guys I have a new
04:29 - keyboard
04:30 - so it's typing a little weird for me
04:32 - today okay and now we just need to pick
04:38 - a spawn location and we're just gonna
04:41 - pick a we're gonna pick a random x
04:48 - position that's just going to be between
04:50 - 0 and with - however wide our cloud
04:58 - image is and the Y is just going to be
05:02 - off the top of the screen and I'm going
05:06 - to spread them out so that they're nice
05:08 - and distant now all we need to do for
05:15 - our update is kill it if it gets past
05:20 - the top the bottom of the screen right
05:31 - I left out my if and then we'll have
05:42 - that so that's our so that's going to be
05:44 - our sprite our clouds bright nice and
05:47 - simple and now over here in the in the
05:53 - game loop we need to tell the clouds how
05:55 - to behave so we're gonna have to move
05:58 - them and we're gonna have to also spawn
06:02 - them so first of all here where we
06:06 - here's where we're scrolling the screen
06:08 - right where if the player gets up in the
06:10 - top corner we're gonna scroll it well
06:12 - this is where we're gonna move the cloud
06:15 - and we can also just start spawning them
06:18 - here because I want them to be you know
06:22 - random kind of spread out occasionally
06:26 - occasionally spawning so we can just in
06:34 - here whenever we scroll there's a chance
06:36 - of spotting one so if we import ran
06:42 - range up here I just imported random so
06:45 - we'll just say random so all we're gonna
06:51 - do is just give a very small percentage
06:54 - chance of finding a cloud whenever we
06:59 - scroll remember they spawn up high so
07:01 - they're gonna be a quick way to spawn
07:03 - one now we also need to scroll the
07:05 - clouds but I want to scroll the clouds
07:07 - at a different speed so that's why I put
07:09 - them in a separate group from the mobs
07:11 - and the platforms and again this is some
07:20 - of you may be thinking that there's
07:23 - probably a more efficient way to do this
07:25 - and there definitely is this is more
07:28 - because we've been adding this stuff one
07:32 - one piece at a time
07:34 - that we're doing that we're doing this
07:37 - in this order like this so I'm going to
07:40 - take the player's velocity and divide by
07:42 - two
07:44 - and then we're going to pick the max of
07:48 - that and then that should move them down
07:55 - at half the speed so they look like
07:57 - they're scrolling by slowly so let's
08:00 - take a look and see what we see
08:04 - okay well I got a typo here I forgot to
08:09 - put dot append all right let's try this
08:16 - now and let's see if we see some cloud
08:18 - spawning now we started out spawning
08:22 - them off the screen there we go all
08:24 - right so you can see how they're
08:25 - scrolling slower and they're nice and
08:28 - and behind all of our other sprites so
08:32 - they don't get in the way although I
08:34 - suppose you could also put them in front
08:36 - of the player if you wanted to have
08:38 - clouds that block your visibility right
08:40 - and add a little extra challenge so what
08:45 - else could we do well we could make them
08:48 - one thing we could do is maybe make them
08:51 - slightly more frequent well this isn't
08:55 - bad but it would also be nice if see
08:59 - when I fall I don't fall into an empty
09:02 - sky so what we can do close this is we
09:09 - can also let them go farther down before
09:12 - we delete them so let's just let them go
09:17 - to screen heights down before they get
09:19 - deleted that way when we do die and we
09:21 - scroll down we'll see some more okay one
09:23 - other thing I want to do is I want to
09:25 - change the image size on the clouds so
09:27 - that we get some randomness in there too
09:29 - so once we load the image I want to
09:32 - scale it I want to use the PI game I
09:35 - want to use the PI game transform dot
09:37 - scale right the image PG transform dot
09:42 - scale and we're going to scale it by
09:46 - some size right and so let's pick a
09:49 - random number for that and I want this
09:52 - scale to be I don't want it to be
09:54 - getting any bigger so the maximum should
09:56 - be one but maybe
09:59 - anywhere between half and one which
10:00 - means I need a random number between 0.5
10:02 - and 1 well an easy way to do that is I
10:07 - could just say R and range remember R
10:11 - and range gives integers whole numbers
10:13 - so I need to pick around a number
10:15 - between 50 and 100 and divide by a
10:18 - hundred and then I will get and actually
10:22 - technically that needs to be 101 and
10:24 - then I'll get 0.5 up to a hundred and
10:27 - then what we're going to do is we're
10:28 - going to multiply the rect width times
10:33 - scale this up the rect with time scale
10:41 - and we're gonna also multiply the height
10:45 - times scale and that would be fine
10:49 - except we have one other small problem
10:52 - which is that we also are need to round
10:59 - these two integers because the scale
11:03 - command is resizing an image to pixels
11:07 - and so it's going to want the right
11:12 - number are just going to want that to be
11:14 - an integer okay all right so that should
11:18 - scale us to the size we want now let's
11:22 - go over here and I'm going to set this
11:24 - number to really large so I'm gonna
11:26 - spawn tons of clouds because I just want
11:28 - to see how they look when I have lots of
11:30 - them on the screen and see if I'm
11:32 - getting all sorts of different sizes all
11:36 - right so here comes some clouds we can
11:38 - see yeah all sorts of different sizes
11:42 - actually doesn't look too bad with a
11:44 - whole bunch of clouds on here does it
11:51 - yeah I kind of like that alright let's
11:59 - just spawn a few and I new here let's
12:02 - just fun a few clouds on our Start
12:07 - screen so I'm gonna spawn 10 see how
12:12 - that works so I'm just gonna spawn a
12:15 - cloud but then they spawn off the top of
12:19 - the screen so I'm gonna re set the Y of
12:24 - the cloud and I'm just gonna add 500 to
12:27 - it so since they spawn up to 500 pixels
12:30 - off I'm just
12:31 - spawning a batch of them and moving them
12:34 - down and I don't know I don't know if 10
12:37 - is good or 8 is good let's give it a try
12:41 - there we go so there's our starting
12:43 - screen and now we can start jumping up
12:48 - and seeing more and more clouds I kind
12:54 - of like it with a lot of clouds like
12:55 - this ok that'll do it for this video if
13:01 - you want a little bit of homework try
13:03 - going down here too where we move the
13:05 - clouds downwards and try randomizing
13:09 - this number so that it varies for each
13:11 - cloud so then the clouds are gonna move
13:13 - downwards at different speeds and so
13:15 - you'll get much more of an impression of
13:17 - depth because some of them will seem
13:18 - like they're farther away and moving
13:19 - slower and some are closer I'm moving
13:22 - faster but I'll leave that for you to
13:23 - try as always thanks for watching I hope
13:26 - you're enjoying making this game it's
13:28 - coming along pretty far please press the
13:31 - like button and help other people find
13:35 - this and I look forward to seeing you
13:37 - guys next time thanks
