00:00 - welcome back this is part four of our
00:03 - platformer game project and we finally
00:05 - gotten to the one you've all been
00:06 - waiting for uh we're going to make our
00:08 - character
00:10 - jump so we have our game uh right now
00:14 - where we have our Sprite with gravity
00:16 - that acts on it that can run back and
00:17 - forth and we can stand on platforms
00:21 - that's good but now we want to talk
00:22 - about jumping so what I've done um since
00:26 - the last time um I did go ahead and I
00:28 - went over here and I added
00:30 - uh a variable here for player gravity in
00:33 - our settings so that in our player
00:36 - Sprite we can just use that here instead
00:39 - of putting the number um that way those
00:42 - of you who want to adjust gravity make
00:44 - your make the gravity in your game
00:45 - different bigger or smaller um you can
00:47 - just change that value right
00:50 - here okay so so how are we going to do
00:53 - jumping
00:55 - well at this point is when I always get
00:58 - lots of questions about uh things like
01:00 - double jumping and um and wall jumping
01:05 - and all that kind of stuff but and we
01:07 - we'll get to that but uh for right now I
01:09 - just want to talk about the very simple
01:10 - jumping where you press a key and you
01:12 - jump in this case the space bar now we
01:16 - don't really want to do it the way we
01:18 - did the keys because we don't want to
01:20 - jump as long as we're holding it down
01:22 - right that would be flying not jumping
01:24 - right if we had pressing the space bar
01:26 - accelerated Us in the negative y
01:29 - direction that would would be like a a
01:30 - jetpack game or a or it' be a good way
01:33 - to do a lunar lander kind of game where
01:35 - you launch your rocket and you thrust
01:37 - upwards and then um when you're coming
01:40 - down you want to thrust again to to slow
01:42 - down and and and land gently uh but
01:44 - that's flying not
01:46 - jumping so what we want to do is we want
01:48 - to go over to our game uh event section
01:51 - and add a an event for the key press uh
01:54 - for the key down so we want to look for
01:58 - the pg. key down
02:01 - event and the and the key that we want
02:04 - to look for is pg.
02:08 - kpace and if that happens we're going to
02:10 - say player. uh
02:14 - jump all right now what do we need to do
02:16 - in player. Jump well over here in our
02:19 - player when we Define jump there a
02:22 - couple things we could do well we could
02:24 - just
02:26 - say we could just say JUMP means
02:31 - self. v.y equals uh -20 or something
02:35 - like that right and that gives us an
02:36 - upward
02:39 - speed and that's fine that will make us
02:42 - go upwards but the problem is that it's
02:44 - going to do it whenever we hit space so
02:46 - if I go over here and Run the game you
02:48 - can see um whenever I hit space I jump
02:52 - right so I can keep hitting it and go
02:54 - higher um which is fine if you're making
02:57 - Flappy Bird or something um um where
03:01 - flapping makes you go up gravity makes
03:02 - you go down uh this is not much of a
03:04 - platform game because we never we could
03:06 - just run around and Never Land on
03:08 - anything okay so here's what we want so
03:12 - what we want to do is we only want to be
03:14 - able to jump if we're standing on
03:17 - something right and how do we tell we're
03:18 - standing on something well we're
03:20 - standing on something if there's
03:21 - something below us so if we just look
03:25 - one pixel below where our Sprite
03:28 - is see if we if there's a platform there
03:31 - meaning see if we collide with a
03:33 - platform then we know we're standing on
03:35 - something and we're allowed to
03:38 - jump so that means in here we need to
03:42 - check to see if we're standing on
03:44 - something right I'm going to go ahead
03:45 - and put that here jump
03:48 - only if
03:50 - standing on a platform okay so we need
03:53 - to be able to check the platforms but
03:55 - the player Sprite doesn't know anything
03:57 - about the
03:58 - platforms player doesn't know they exist
04:02 - so what we can do is over in our game
04:05 - Loop when we spawn the
04:07 - player we can basically send the player
04:11 - it's called a reference we send it a
04:14 - link to the game and then it knows all
04:16 - about all the games variables including
04:19 - this platforms group right so when our
04:22 - player
04:23 - spawns it knows about the game and we
04:26 - can say self. game equals game and now
04:29 - the player has a essentially a copy of
04:31 - the game it's not really a copy it's a
04:32 - reference but um it knows about
04:35 - everything that's part of the game and
04:38 - that means that we can go right here and
04:41 - do that Collision so we want to look
04:43 - underneath us so we want to take the
04:46 - rectangle of the of the player Right add
04:50 - one to it so one one pixel lower we do
04:53 - our
04:57 - Collision just like we've done before
04:59 - for right we Collide our self with the
05:03 - self. game.
05:04 - platforms still
05:07 - false and then we don't really want to
05:09 - be inside the inside the platform so we
05:13 - move the rect right back up again and so
05:16 - this happens right away so it's you're
05:18 - never going to actually see this because
05:19 - there's no drawing or updating happening
05:21 - between these two commands so all we're
05:24 - doing is just shifting it down
05:26 - temporarily to see if there's anything
05:27 - below us if there is
05:30 - then we can jump okay so let's see how
05:34 - that
05:37 - looks let's go over here run our
05:40 - game and there we go okay so that's much
05:42 - better so you can see if I'm if I hit
05:45 - space again while I'm in the air nothing
05:47 - happens right until I land back on the
05:49 - platform then I can jump
05:51 - again right very cool can jump around
05:55 - it's already lots of fun I can jump
05:57 - around ah except now we see something
06:00 - strange right when I jump so I'm
06:02 - snapping to the top of this platform
06:06 - right if you think about how we did the
06:08 - platform collisions for falling um it'll
06:11 - be kind of obvious why it's doing that
06:13 - right we start jumping up and then as
06:15 - soon as we touch a platform we're
06:17 - instantly snapping to the top of it and
06:18 - setting our velocity to zero so that's
06:21 - not good right we don't want that to
06:24 - happen and for this game since I'm
06:26 - thinking about doing this as sort of a
06:29 - if you're famili with Doodle Jump kind
06:31 - of game um I do want to be able to jump
06:34 - up through the platforms I just don't
06:36 - want to snap to them like this so I want
06:38 - to be able to jump up and then land on
06:40 - it so I actually only want to land on
06:42 - things when I am going
06:46 - downwards not anytime so in our update
06:51 - right here we're just checking all the
06:53 - time to see if we hit a platform all
06:55 - right this is the part I should have
06:57 - labeled this last time uh check if
06:59 - player
07:01 - hits uh hits a
07:05 - platform only if falling right so only
07:09 - if falling so how do we tell we're
07:11 - falling well it means our velocity is
07:13 - downwards or greater than zero so if
07:17 - player
07:20 - do X the x of the player or sorry the Y
07:23 - of the player not the x is greater than
07:26 - zero okay then we can do all of this
07:31 - stuff but not if it's not okay so that's
07:34 - going to look more like this okay so I
07:36 - still jump like I did but if I'm
07:38 - underneath it I jump up and land on it
07:42 - okay so that's much more doodle
07:48 - jumpy and works the way we want it to
07:51 - for the game that we're going to be
07:54 - making now obviously there are lots of
07:56 - other ways we could do
07:57 - this um sometimes in game you don't want
08:00 - to uh jump to the top of it right or be
08:03 - able to jump through it you would want
08:05 - jumping up like this to stop you when
08:07 - you're head hit the platform um and if
08:10 - you come in from the side right now we
08:12 - have a thing where if we come in from
08:15 - the side we're going to land on the top
08:17 - um because we're only really looking at
08:19 - the top um now that's fine for this game
08:23 - um to do collisions in all four
08:25 - directions to a platform is a little
08:28 - more complicated in the code so I'm
08:30 - going to hold off before we add that
08:31 - until we've explored a little bit more
08:33 - of how to get this simple Doodle Jump
08:35 - Style game working then we can talk a
08:37 - little bit more about how um how we're
08:40 - going to make
08:42 - something more advanced work okay so try
08:45 - that out um you can go ahead and add
08:48 - some more platforms if you want
08:50 - although I think we have I'll take a few
08:52 - more minutes to to talk about a simpler
08:54 - way to add more platforms without adding
08:56 - them uh one at a time like we're doing
09:00 - uh like we're doing
09:02 - here so what I want to do is just set up
09:04 - a list of the platforms that I want uh
09:07 - on the screen when it starts kind of
09:10 - like the the start screen okay and I'm
09:12 - going to go over here and I'm going to
09:13 - add that to our
09:15 - settings platform or we'll call this
09:18 - starting platforms because we're going
09:20 - to do other things with the platforms
09:22 - later okay so let's just call it the
09:24 - platform list okay and this is just
09:26 - going to be a list of
09:29 - a bunch of platform coordinates right
09:33 - now I know the first two that I want to
09:35 - do I want to do this
09:37 - one right because I want to make the the
09:39 - one that's on the ground okay and then
09:43 - I'm going to do a comma and I'm going to
09:45 - do I'll just go ahead and do this second
09:48 - one right that's a good one to do and
09:53 - then we could add a few
09:55 - more now you can play around there's
09:57 - different ways you could do
10:00 - where you want to put them just remember
10:01 - it's it's the first number is the
10:04 - X right so the second number is the Y so
10:08 - like you could do something like height
10:09 - minus 350 and that would be 350 pixels
10:13 - from the
10:14 - bottom um the width of the
10:17 - platform and the and the thickness of
10:20 - the
10:21 - platform okay and I'll do a couple more
10:24 - just so I have a good assortment of uh
10:28 - platform on the screen you can play
10:32 - around with these numbers uh put them in
10:34 - different places um you know obviously
10:37 - if you wanted a smaller platform I'm
10:39 - doing them all at 100 we could do this
10:41 - one could be a nice skinny one right but
10:44 - then I have a list of one two three four
10:47 - five platforms that are going to show up
10:48 - on the screen uh at the start of the
10:50 - game okay so once I have that list
10:54 - that's just a list of you know sets of
10:56 - four numbers that I'm going to use to
10:58 - create each platform so over here
11:01 - instead of all of
11:03 - this we're going to do a loop and just
11:05 - Loop through we're going to Loop through
11:08 - this list and use the first entry in the
11:10 - list is this set of four second one
11:12 - third one right and it'll just make each
11:14 - one so I'm going to sa
11:17 - for just call it a plat for short that's
11:19 - another little abbreviation I like to
11:21 - use for Platforms in uh platform list
11:25 - okay so for each one of those I want to
11:27 - make a platform so let's just call it P
11:30 - platform right and then we know we have
11:32 - to put the four numbers now now there's
11:33 - two ways we can do this we could say uh
11:36 - plat zero right plat one plat two and
11:39 - plat three right and that would do the
11:42 - the zero the one the two and the three
11:46 - item in the list but there's a shortcut
11:48 - for that if you want to take a list and
11:51 - break it up into all of its pieces just
11:53 - like we're doing here that's also called
11:56 - exploding the list so in Python we just
11:58 - say star plat right the star stands for
12:02 - explode in this case so take the plat
12:04 - take that list and explode it into its
12:06 - four components and then we have a
12:09 - platform and we just
12:13 - add the platform the platform to the all
12:16 - Sprites list
12:18 - and to the platforms
12:22 - list right and that's a lot
12:24 - less uh that's a lot less verbose than
12:26 - doing it all one at a time and if you
12:29 - want to change them you can go over and
12:30 - change those coordinates let's see what
12:32 - that looks
12:33 - like all right there we go now I've got
12:35 - some different platforms that I can jump
12:38 - to um and bounce around the screen and
12:40 - you can play around with that you can do
12:43 - fun stuff like jumping off the side and
12:45 - landing on another one that's going to
12:46 - be a good strategy maybe um okay and so
12:50 - we'll stop there for now uh play around
12:54 - with how it works try changing some of
12:56 - those settings right that's why we
12:58 - that's why we put them in the
13:01 - settings uh file here and what I
13:04 - recommend you do though is just make
13:06 - sure you have for moving forward make
13:09 - sure you have not too many platforms but
13:12 - not too few um and a good spread of them
13:16 - so that you can get up to the top of the
13:17 - screen because next video we'll start
13:20 - talking about how are we going to scroll
13:24 - this scroll the screen when we get up
13:26 - near the top or move the camera if you
13:28 - like to look at it that way how are we
13:29 - going to keep going higher and get to
13:31 - more
13:32 - platforms all right thanks I'll see you
13:34 - next time
