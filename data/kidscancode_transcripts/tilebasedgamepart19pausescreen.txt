00:00 - all right welcome back to in game
00:01 - development with Piegan this is part 19
00:03 - of our zombie style top-down shooter
00:07 - table based game and in this video we're
00:10 - going to add a pause screen and maybe a
00:13 - couple other minor things so before we
00:17 - get to adding the pause menu there's a
00:20 - couple small things that I want to do
00:21 - and one of them is right now we have the
00:26 - zombies when they die oh by the way I
00:29 - did find a better pistol sound if you
00:32 - can hear that the bassam bees make that
00:35 - splat noise and they disappear but I
00:37 - want to leave you know some sort of
00:40 - indication that I've killed some zombies
00:43 - already and to do that I just made a
00:46 - little green
00:48 - splat image like this it just looks like
00:50 - a splatter and we're going to draw that
00:53 - on to the ground whenever we delete a
00:58 - zombie so so we're just going to load
01:01 - that image first that's the first thing
01:04 - we need to do so we're just going to
01:07 - call this the splat and we need to load
01:15 - from the image folder whatever this
01:18 - splat image is dot convert alpha and
01:23 - I've just added that to the settings
01:25 - over here
01:26 - it's splat green dot PNG and then I made
01:32 - that image large so that it would be
01:35 - we'd be able to use it at whatever scale
01:36 - we wanted so I'm going to scale it
01:41 - initially here to a good size
01:44 - I found that splat I found that 64 by 64
01:49 - wound up being a pretty good size all
01:54 - right so there's our splat image and
01:56 - we're we now have it loaded and now we
01:59 - want to draw it whenever we add zombies
02:03 - he'll three to zero and we delete it you
02:05 - know and play that splat sound while
02:06 - we're doing that in the zombies code
02:10 - right here in my class mom
02:13 - so when my health when the zombies hell
02:16 - 3 to 0 it you know draws itself on this
02:19 - I mean it deletes itself it plays a
02:22 - splat sound and we want to also just
02:26 - draw it and so the place we're gonna
02:28 - draw that is on the game's map image
02:35 - we're gonna just draw that we're going
02:39 - to draw the splat image at whatever
02:42 - position the zombie was that - a little
02:48 - bit
02:48 - right or half the size right cuz well I
02:50 - want to centered it where the zombie was
02:51 - okay so that's simple enough now when I
02:54 - kill a zombie
02:56 - I can see a nice little splat mark there
03:00 - on the ground and let's kill a few more
03:03 - any fewer back up a few
03:11 - okay and it looks nice you can see
03:14 - there's been some action here okay on to
03:19 - the pausing by the way as we go on I
03:22 - think you know this is usually the way I
03:25 - work on things too is every once in a
03:27 - while you get an idea for a small little
03:29 - little addition and you go and you take
03:32 - care of that before you go do the next
03:34 - big task it sometimes feels nice to add
03:38 - some of those little small things that
03:39 - might not be big enough for a whole
03:41 - video okay so in the new here we're
03:45 - gonna have a new variable called paused
03:49 - and this is whether the game is paused
03:51 - or not right and so that's going to be a
03:54 - flag that we can toggle by pressing a
03:57 - key so that means we're going to go down
03:59 - to our draw section or miss our events
04:04 - section and if we press the P key P for
04:10 - pause is what I'm gonna use then we just
04:14 - take the paused variable and we make it
04:17 - the opposite all right we invert it so
04:23 - now we have this variable that we can
04:24 - toggle between true and false but now
04:28 - what do we want to do when the screen or
04:31 - when the game is paused well there's a
04:34 - couple of things the first one is I want
04:36 - to make everything stop happening right
04:41 - I want to stop the game and the easiest
04:44 - way to do that and the simplest way to
04:46 - do that is of course much more
04:48 - complicated things you can do is here in
04:50 - the run loop right here update is what
04:55 - moves everything and makes it all go to
04:57 - different places so we're just gonna say
04:58 - if we're not paused then we're going to
05:03 - update so only if paused is false will
05:08 - we update all the sprites and do
05:13 - everything else that needs to happen
05:14 - here in the update section
05:17 - so take a look now we can run and when I
05:21 - hit P everything is frozen okay I can't
05:25 - move I can't do anything I hit P again
05:27 - everything starts going right so I can
05:29 - toggle between right so yeah pause
05:35 - though there's a bullet there okay so
05:38 - that's fine but it's also hard to tell
05:40 - that everything is paused so we want to
05:43 - have some kind of effect to notice
05:44 - notify us that the the game is paused
05:47 - the first thing we're going to do is we
05:49 - are going to add a function called draw
05:56 - text so I want to see the word paused on
05:58 - the screen now this draw text function
06:03 - I've just copied and pasted is this is
06:05 - very similar to the one we made for the
06:07 - shmoop game and that we used also in the
06:10 - platformer jumping game and this is just
06:14 - a function that what you pass to it is
06:17 - some text that you want to draw what
06:20 - font you want to use to do the drawing
06:23 - since week that way we can use different
06:25 - fonts for different things what size you
06:27 - want it to be what color you want it to
06:29 - be where you want it to be and an a line
06:34 - a line means what corner of the
06:37 - rectangle do you want to place at that x
06:39 - and y that way you can you know write
06:41 - justify or Center or however you want to
06:44 - place the text and you can see here
06:46 - depending on what value you pass it'll
06:49 - set a different a different coordinate
06:53 - of the rectangle to that position okay
06:57 - and it's just going to draw that text on
06:58 - to a location so you can pause it right
07:03 - here if you want to look through that
07:04 - code okay so we have this draw text
07:07 - function and we just want to draw it at
07:11 - a certain location and so the first
07:14 - thing I'm going to do is pick a font and
07:18 - what I did was I wanted to I wanted a
07:20 - nice thematic font that would work well
07:23 - for this game and I found
07:28 - I found this font called join this I'm
07:38 - just putting the font in the image
07:40 - folder along with the other art and it's
07:43 - it's called zombie dot TTS obviously you
07:49 - can use any TrueType font that you go
07:52 - and find yourself there's a lot of
07:54 - different great websites out there to
07:56 - have free open source or royalty-free
07:59 - fonts that you can use for for making
08:03 - games but that's the font we're going to
08:06 - use and in fact I think we'll call this
08:11 - the title font because there might be
08:13 - other fonts we want to use for other
08:16 - bits of text that we want to show and we
08:18 - can load those later okay
08:20 - so we're gonna use the title font and
08:23 - then in our draw section down here where
08:27 - we're drawing everything on the screen
08:29 - if we're paused we're gonna draw that
08:34 - text so right down here at the end here
08:37 - cuz I want on top of everything else if
08:40 - we're paused then we're gonna draw we're
08:44 - going to use our draw text function the
08:46 - words we want to say are paused excuse
08:51 - me the font I want to use is the title
08:54 - font the size we're gonna do 105 we're
09:00 - doing it in red and I want it centered
09:03 - so I'm gonna say width divided by 2 and
09:06 - height divided by 2 and then the the
09:11 - align is going to be Center okay so now
09:17 - when we run it we will see that when I
09:20 - hit P it shows up and says whether I'm
09:23 - paused or not and that way I can tell
09:25 - when the game is paused and that's nice
09:29 - but I think we could do a little bit
09:31 - better and the other thing I want to do
09:33 - while the game is paused is I want to
09:36 - dim the screen
09:39 - and so dimming the screen means we want
09:42 - to basically a couple ways you could
09:46 - look at it we want to lower the
09:48 - brightness of everything on the screen
09:49 - or we want to draw a semi-transparent
09:54 - gray kind of translucent image over top
09:59 - of the screen so it looks like it dims
10:01 - everything so what we want to do is we
10:04 - want to have a an image to use and so
10:08 - we're gonna go back up here to our load
10:10 - data here and what we're going to do is
10:15 - right here I'm going to make an image to
10:21 - dim the screen and it's just going to be
10:23 - a surface and it's size is just going to
10:26 - be the same size as the screen so we
10:28 - just say get get size and then I want to
10:33 - do convert alpha just like we do on
10:36 - every other image they definitely want
10:37 - this to have a transparency channel and
10:39 - then the dim screen I'm going to fill
10:41 - with black but with a alpha channel of
10:52 - 180 right so either that could be 0 or
10:57 - 255 to be maximum but I'm gonna put it
11:00 - somewhere in the middle because I want
11:01 - it to be dim and then what we can do is
11:04 - down in our draw section just like we're
11:06 - drawing the text we're also going to
11:10 - draw that image on top of everything so
11:13 - we're just gonna let that image the dim
11:17 - screen and we're just gonna put it at 0
11:22 - 0 so it covers the whole screen it's the
11:24 - size of the screen remember so if we
11:26 - draw it starting a knee up left hand
11:28 - corner
11:28 - it'll be the same size as a screen and
11:30 - so when we run it that's gonna look like
11:33 - that yeah isn't that nice so now as
11:38 - we're running around and seeing you know
11:41 - what's going on when we pause the game
11:44 - you know everything was dimmed a little
11:46 - bit and just to show you what difference
11:49 - that makes if we were to put let's say
11:52 - we were to
11:52 - at a much lower value here in the Alpha
11:56 - Channel
11:56 - this is gonna be brighter or dimmer well
12:00 - let's take a look it's not nearly as
12:03 - much right because if we've gone all the
12:05 - way to zero that would mean it would be
12:07 - fully transparent so we wouldn't see any
12:10 - change at all so basically that bigger
12:12 - didn't bigger you make this number you
12:14 - know the more closer to the closer to
12:18 - black it's going to be see there it's
12:20 - even dimmer so I kind of liked that a
12:24 - little more than middle range number of
12:27 - 180 for our pause screen there we go
12:37 - hopefully that was helpful to you in
12:40 - this game or any other game that you
12:42 - might be looking to put a pause menu in
12:44 - this is super super simple and
12:47 - straightforward way to do it and it
12:48 - looks really nice with that dim screen
12:51 - okay as always thanks for watching in
12:54 - the next video we are going to start
12:56 - adding some different weapon types I
13:00 - think the next one will be the shotgun
