00:00 - welcome back this is game development
00:02 - with tie game this is part 13 of our
00:04 - top-down tile based shooter and in this
00:08 - video we'll be adding obstacles to our
00:10 - tiled map so the next thing we want to
00:13 - add to our map is we want to add some
00:16 - obstacles or we want to define the
00:17 - obstacles that are the things we don't
00:19 - want the player to be able to walk
00:20 - through like this wall here for example
00:23 - or maybe the table or the couch I want
00:26 - to define those and make those walls to
00:28 - do that we're going to use a different
00:30 - kind of layer so you notice we these are
00:33 - all tile layers that we made to draw the
00:36 - different layers of our map and when
00:39 - we're on the tile layers these buttons
00:41 - over here are active and these ones are
00:44 - not well I'm going to create now an
00:48 - object layer so I click on new layer new
00:52 - object layer and I'm going to name this
00:55 - obstacles okay now when I'm on the when
01:01 - I'm on the object layer these buttons
01:05 - become active and what these let you do
01:08 - is draw objects onto your map so let's
01:12 - pick the rectangle here and let's just
01:15 - go out here and draw a rectangle so I
01:18 - just drew a rectangle just randomly drew
01:20 - a rectangle and that's going to be an
01:22 - object if I click again and let me draw
01:23 - another one but I don't want to do that
01:25 - so I'm gonna undo and then I'm going to
01:27 - go over here and I'm gonna click on the
01:28 - Select objects tool and that's gonna be
01:31 - the most useful and that lets you grab
01:33 - an object move it around change its size
01:36 - and so on right like if I wanted to
01:39 - occupy one square I could just make the
01:43 - obstacle of that size and if you notice
01:48 - in the View menu you can set it to snap
01:51 - to grid which will only allow your
01:53 - obstacles or your objects to be one full
01:57 - grid square so 64 by 64 or what I have
02:01 - on is snap to fine grid which lets me
02:04 - resize it to fractions of the tile size
02:09 - and that's an a setting that you can set
02:11 - but right now it's set to do it in
02:13 - quarters which is just fine for now
02:17 - so we could make an object like this for
02:20 - every square that we want to be an
02:21 - obstacle but that's going to be kind of
02:22 - inefficient it's gonna make a lot of
02:24 - them so what we could do is we could
02:26 - just make it like that right I could
02:29 - just resize it to fill this this wall
02:32 - it'll still be a rectangle so in our PI
02:34 - game collisions we'll still be able to
02:36 - do rectangle collisions I've just saved
02:40 - myself a little bit of time by making it
02:42 - one rectangle instead of a bunch of
02:45 - squares so now over here you can see the
02:49 - properties of our object it tells you
02:51 - the X and the y of where the object is
02:54 - located so you can see as I move this
02:56 - around right that it changes and if it
03:01 - were all the way up in the corner
03:02 - all right the x and y would be 0 0 and
03:06 - you can also see how wide and how tall
03:09 - it is so those are going to be useful to
03:12 - define the rectangle in our code but we
03:16 - also have these name and type fields and
03:19 - these are basically things you can use
03:21 - for any any data you want because we're
03:24 - gonna be able to read whatever is in
03:26 - these fields when we read this into our
03:30 - program so I'm gonna click on name here
03:32 - and I'm going to call this a wall so now
03:36 - you see the name appears above it that's
03:37 - why I'm using name instead of type if I
03:40 - put something if I left name empty and I
03:42 - put wall and type it's just as useful
03:45 - but I can't see the label here and it's
03:48 - kind of nice to know what the object is
03:50 - because I'm gonna have this wall object
03:54 - and I'm gonna copy and paste it and I'm
03:58 - gonna put one over here and what this
04:00 - one is gonna be it's just a little
04:03 - square that I'm going to name player and
04:07 - I'm gonna use this for my player spawn
04:09 - point this is where I want my player to
04:12 - appear is right here centered on this
04:15 - little square of the sidewalk so I have
04:19 - a wall object now and I have a player
04:20 - object now so make sure you save
04:24 - your map so we have this new layer added
04:28 - in and then we'll go over to our code
04:31 - and read these layers in and create the
04:36 - objects where they need to be okay
04:41 - so we're already reading in the TMX file
04:46 - the child map that we saved so reading
04:49 - that in and we're now gonna have access
04:51 - to that object layer so all we need to
04:54 - do is down here just like we were doing
04:56 - previously where we were going through
04:58 - our old textile map and looking for ones
05:03 - and M's and peas and we just want to
05:05 - look through the object layer of our
05:08 - tile map and look for those named
05:11 - objects the ones named wall and the ones
05:13 - named player so we're going to do and
05:17 - I'm going to leave this this commented
05:19 - out here in case you ever want to go
05:20 - back to it you can so we're going to do
05:23 - another loop here and we're going to go
05:24 - through we'll call it tile object in the
05:30 - TMX data objects so the TMX data that we
05:39 - loaded has a list called objects that's
05:43 - going to hold all the objects that we
05:45 - defined in our object layer and we're
05:47 - going to loop through each one and we're
05:51 - gonna find out what the properties are
05:54 - and the properties are a dictionary okay
05:59 - and what I mean by that is if we look
06:00 - back at the map real quick we're gonna
06:02 - get each object we're gonna get a
06:03 - dictionary and for the dictionary key X
06:06 - it's going to have this value the key
06:08 - width is going to have this value and so
06:10 - on so we'll be able to look for name
06:15 - we're gonna look for X Y width and
06:17 - height for the objects that we want to
06:20 - create but now before we do that we need
06:24 - to create walls right and our wall
06:26 - object that we defined earlier our wall
06:29 - sprite doesn't have a width and a height
06:32 - it's just the 64 by 64 square that we
06:37 - made well
06:38 - I could change this but again I'm gonna
06:40 - leave this and I'm just gonna duplicate
06:43 - it in case you want to ever use that
06:46 - sprite again I'm gonna leave it there
06:47 - for now okay we're not gonna use it
06:49 - we're gonna create I'm just gonna call
06:52 - this an obstacle okay and an obstacle
06:56 - sprite when we create it is not even
07:00 - gonna be visible I'm not gonna put it in
07:02 - the all sprites group and it's not going
07:03 - to be drawn it's not going to have it's
07:05 - not going to have an image right it's
07:08 - just going to be an object that we can
07:10 - collide with that's invisibly gonna sit
07:13 - on top of the wall so when we create it
07:16 - we're gonna pass an X a Y a width and a
07:19 - height and we're just going to make a
07:21 - rectangle using that X doesn't want to
07:31 - stay in there there we go the Y the
07:35 - width and the height and the rest can
07:41 - stay the same except we need to get rid
07:43 - of don't need to x tile size because
07:46 - it's going to give us the pixel x and y
07:48 - so this will be the sprite that we're
07:52 - gonna create it's just a sprite that has
07:53 - a rectangle so it can do the collisions
07:57 - all right so we're just going to spawn
07:59 - one of these obstacle sprites if the
08:02 - object has a property name equals wall
08:05 - and if it has a property name equals
08:08 - player well will spawn the player go
08:11 - back over here to main so all we have to
08:13 - do is look at those values so if tile
08:20 - object dot name equals player did I
08:27 - capitalize that I didn't capitalize it
08:28 - so if the tile a bit name is player then
08:31 - we're going to spawn the player right
08:36 - itself and then the X will be the tile
08:39 - object dot X and the y will be the tile
08:44 - object dot Y and I can remove that
08:49 - and now if we run it we're gonna spawn
08:53 - our player but we need to make sure we
08:55 - go over here and again we don't multiply
08:59 - by tile size anymore because we're gonna
09:02 - spawn the player at that location okay
09:06 - so there's my player spawning in the
09:09 - spot I want him to and then we can just
09:13 - do the same thing if the tile object
09:17 - name is wall then what we want to do is
09:22 - we want to add a player I mean I'm sorry
09:24 - an obstacle we want to add an obstacle
09:27 - and then each of these properties is
09:33 - just going to be a tile object dot the
09:38 - name of the property so tile tile object
09:42 - dot X dot Y I'll continue this on the
09:46 - next line since it's kind of long I'll
09:51 - get dot with anti object dot hi okay and
09:58 - that's going to spawn an obstacle where
10:01 - the wall was so let's run now okay so
10:07 - now as you can see I can't go through
10:11 - that wall
10:22 - so now on your map
10:24 - you just need to go through and anywhere
10:26 - you want there to be a wall you're gonna
10:29 - create another one of these objects
10:33 - named wall the quickest way to do that
10:35 - is just going to be to copy and paste
10:38 - and just make another one size like that
10:44 - now what's also nice is if i zoom back
10:47 - in we could make this let's say we
10:50 - wanted to make this bush an obstacle to
10:52 - so I could come out here and resize it
10:57 - like that but that's going to make the
11:00 - player clip against this corner here
11:03 - right and so what we can do is we can
11:06 - actually make an obstacle that's just
11:08 - that big for the bush and then the
11:12 - player look like he gets close to the
11:14 - bush but doesn't can't go through it
11:15 - okay let's take a look so now I can get
11:22 - up close to that bush but I can't go
11:24 - through it okay and now these other wall
11:30 - sections are solid but I can go through
11:34 - the door so we can go ahead and do that
11:42 - we can go through and add walls wherever
11:45 - there need to be walls and then we can
11:48 - also take and just like we did with the
11:51 - player we can define a spot here for a
11:57 - zombie to spawn all we need to do is
12:00 - just name this zombie and anywhere we
12:05 - find a zombie object will spawn a zombie
12:07 - there okay so skipping ahead this is
12:13 - what the map is gonna look like once you
12:15 - have filled in all the obstacles
12:19 - everywhere you want there to be a wall
12:23 - or something where the player can't walk
12:26 - but here's the thing when we run this
12:30 - you know we can try it out and it'll
12:33 - work the walls are all blocking and the
12:37 - table and everything like that but I
12:40 - need to be able to see sometimes when
12:42 - you're troubleshooting you need to be
12:43 - able to see what you're actually
12:45 - colliding with instead of these
12:48 - invisible objects and so what we're
12:51 - gonna do here is in the new section
12:54 - we're going to add a flag and remember a
12:58 - flag is a variable that can be true or
13:00 - false we're gonna call this draw debug
13:04 - okay and it's going to start out being
13:07 - false normally we don't want it on but
13:11 - in our events I'm gonna add a key here
13:19 - and so we're going to use the H key for
13:27 - this we're not using that for anything
13:28 - else let's use H so if I press the H key
13:33 - then draw a debug equals not draw a
13:41 - debug right so if it's true change it to
13:43 - false if it's false change it to true
13:44 - that way I can toggle back and forth and
13:48 - now in my draw section I can just add
13:52 - here when I go through all the sprites
13:53 - which is going to be the player and the
13:56 - zombies
13:59 - if draw debug is on then I'm going to
14:03 - draw a rectangle so draw a rectangle on
14:10 - the screen I'm going to use cyan and
14:13 - we're just going to use a self dot
14:18 - camera apply because we have to apply
14:20 - the offset to the sprites hit rect all
14:26 - right because I want to see the hit
14:27 - rectangle of the sprite and then I also
14:30 - need to say if draw debug is on then for
14:36 - all the walls I need to do the same
14:40 - thing right I need to look at each of
14:42 - the walls so let's duplicate this line
14:46 - and I'm going to shift that down to
14:49 - there and what we're gonna do is we're
14:52 - all the we're gonna say apply oops I
14:58 - just noticed this should be apply rect
15:03 - apply rect to the wall defect okay
15:10 - and oh let's just make these I just want
15:14 - these to be thin rectangles not filled
15:16 - in so I'm going to put comma one there
15:18 - for the width and now if we run this by
15:22 - hitting H I can see the outlines of all
15:25 - these things right I can just turn that
15:27 - on and off just so that as we move
15:31 - forward and are making sure thing
15:33 - work we can see where things are
15:37 - actually colliding and all that's left
15:43 - now is to just add one other check here
15:48 - that if we find an object called zombie
15:53 - in the map we're gonna spawn a mob I
16:05 - like that X dot Y and our mobs right
16:12 - here again get rid of the x tile size
16:17 - and that way we should now be spawning
16:22 - everything we need to spawn there's some
16:25 - zombies right there still colliding with
16:28 - the walls just like they're supposed to
16:34 - still not very smart
16:39 - oops and I just realized when we fire
16:44 - the bullet it's trying to draw the hit
16:45 - rectangle of the bullet the bullets
16:47 - don't have a hit rectangle we didn't add
16:49 - that to the bullet when we spawned them
16:51 - so let's just do that here and the hit
16:58 - rect of the bullet is just gonna be the
17:03 - same as the rectangle of the bullet
17:05 - right that way we can go over here and
17:09 - hit H and now when we're shooting we can
17:12 - see our bull it's hard to see the little
17:18 - rectangle around the bullet anyway but
17:20 - better than getting an error message all
17:25 - right that will do it for this video as
17:29 - always please like and subscribe and if
17:33 - you have drawn your own map with the
17:36 - Kenny game art tiles here I'd really
17:40 - like to see it please share it in the
17:42 - comments below so everybody can see what
17:44 - you've come up with
17:46 - I'm sure you guys can do even better
17:48 - than my little simple map here that
17:50 - isn't even finished and has all this
17:53 - empty space still waiting to get filled
17:55 - in alright and I will see you guys in
17:58 - the next video
18:06 - you
