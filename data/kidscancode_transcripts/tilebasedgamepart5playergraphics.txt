00:00 - welcome back to game development a game
00:02 - this is part 5 of our tile based game
00:04 - project and in this video we're gonna
00:07 - get started with the player graphics and
00:10 - start planning ahead for some of the
00:12 - gameplay features that we will be making
00:14 - in the next coming weeks in the last
00:20 - video we made our map scrollable and
00:24 - made it so that we can create a map
00:27 - that's much bigger than the screen area
00:29 - and move around on it and that allows us
00:32 - to do things like for example I made
00:35 - this little map that has a maze so we
00:40 - got a maze here that you can try and
00:43 - find your way through but one thing
00:46 - about this is you can sure see a whole
00:49 - lot of the maze at once so what we could
00:52 - do and I think I'm going to do is go
00:55 - over here to my settings and make my
00:57 - tile size 64 so the toes will be much
01:00 - larger and then things are going to be
01:05 - more like this right so we have much
01:07 - more of feeling of exploration right we
01:11 - can only see a limited part of the
01:13 - screen at a time and of course this is a
01:16 - maze so there's only one route through
01:21 - it so that's not really ideal so I also
01:25 - have this other map I'm just gonna go
01:28 - over here that's that I saved that's
01:31 - actually this map is taken from a level
01:37 - from the classic arcade game gauntlet
01:40 - and so it's a nice map you can run
01:43 - around in and has all sorts of different
01:46 - rooms and things but one thing that you
01:50 - might notice depending on how you've
01:52 - laid out your map
01:53 - is that it can be very hard to navigate
01:57 - through smaller openings like if you
02:01 - leave a one tile gap for example say
02:03 - there was a powerup in here that I
02:06 - wanted to pick up it's really hard to
02:07 - get down into that little hole because
02:09 - my sprite is the exact same
02:13 - there we go but it was difficult right
02:15 - as the sprite is the exact same size as
02:17 - a tile so there's no leeway there so we
02:22 - probably want our player sprite to be at
02:25 - least slightly smaller than the size of
02:29 - the tile and we could do that we could
02:32 - adjust the size of the square but first
02:37 - before we do that or instead of doing
02:40 - that I'm gonna start talking about how
02:41 - we're gonna put together the graphics of
02:44 - this game starting with the player
02:46 - sprite so the first thing that I want to
02:49 - do before we change the graphics around
02:52 - to start working on improving the
02:54 - movement and the controls is I want to
02:57 - go over here to our player sprite and
03:00 - change some of this code to start using
03:03 - vectors instead of individual variables
03:07 - like we're doing here we've talked about
03:09 - vectors before vectors are very useful
03:13 - for lots of things and you're gonna see
03:19 - as we go into this project some of the
03:22 - things that I have in mind are going to
03:23 - be a lot easier to do with vectors then
03:27 - they're going to be with individual
03:29 - variables and having to do the
03:32 - trigonometry that's involved with
03:34 - finding angles of things and and and all
03:38 - that sort of stuff and you'll see how
03:39 - that goes as we go on but so I'm going
03:42 - to load this by game vector class and
03:45 - I'm going to use that for a lot of my
03:47 - variables in my player and especially
03:51 - right here we're gonna have we're just
03:54 - going to have a velocity vector instead
03:58 - of VX and V Y and we're gonna have a
04:02 - position vector instead of this
04:05 - individual X&Y so this is going to be
04:07 - the X and the y times tile size and then
04:12 - we don't need those so I've replaced
04:15 - four variables with just two right if
04:19 - that means we got to go down here and
04:20 - we've got to clean up all of these
04:22 - things so I'm going to duplicate this
04:24 - line
04:26 - move that down to here and for the
04:35 - movement we're just going to change
04:37 - these to be the velocity X or the
04:44 - velocity dot Y is what we're going to
04:46 - set to the speeds and also these and
04:54 - which means oops which means we can go
05:00 - over here and in this triangle or me
05:04 - sorry in the diagonal fix we can change
05:07 - this to just multiplying the velocity
05:12 - times 0.707 1 now we're also going to
05:17 - have to fix the update here and we're
05:20 - just going to say that self dot pause we
05:24 - just add the velocity to that instead of
05:29 - that and then we don't need to do that
05:32 - and then we just move our rectangle is
05:35 - equal to each of our positions
05:40 - okay simplifies that a little bit and
05:43 - finally we got to do that in the
05:46 - colliding here so this is going to be
05:49 - velocity X velocity X velocity y Y and Y
06:00 - so we're gonna be using velocity in all
06:02 - these places and everywhere we had self
06:05 - dot X and self dot y we're gonna use the
06:09 - position instead they're there they're
06:15 - there and they're these are all going to
06:20 - be position okay and that I think is
06:26 - everything we need to change
06:31 - okay there we go so we're back to where
06:34 - we want we're before we're still moving
06:36 - around now we can start talking about
06:38 - what kind of graphics we want to use for
06:41 - this player sprite so I spent some time
06:47 - looking through open game art and trying
06:49 - out some different options that were
06:51 - there and because I want to stick to
06:57 - freely licensed you know non copyrighted
07:02 - imagery I went back to our old friend
07:07 - Kenny and I found this which is Kenny's
07:12 - top-down shooter pack it has lots of
07:16 - great tiles that we're going to be able
07:17 - to use to layout our game environment
07:21 - and a bunch of different sprites for
07:24 - good and bad guys to do all sorts of
07:26 - different things with so we're gonna
07:29 - make a this we're going to use this art
07:31 - so this is gonna be a top-down game of
07:35 - course most of the code we write will
07:37 - work just the same as if we were doing a
07:40 - kind of Zelda style side view which
07:44 - really is a top-down game you just draw
07:46 - the sprites with a slight side
07:49 - perspective but the movement and
07:51 - everything is going to work pretty much
07:53 - the same okay so this is what the art
07:57 - Pat look that looks like so we're gonna
07:59 - use one of these sprites for our player
08:01 - to start with and we'll get to the rest
08:03 - of it as we get a chance here's a little
08:06 - preview of some a mock-up of how the art
08:10 - goes together looks really nice you can
08:12 - do all sorts of different rooms and
08:14 - environments outdoor and indoor and I've
08:19 - got some cool-looking little zombies
08:21 - that can chase you around okay so so
08:25 - we're gonna use the little picture of
08:30 - one of the characters for our player
08:35 - sprite right and so that's easy enough
08:38 - to start with we just need to load that
08:40 - and use it in our sprite class
08:44 - instead of the rectangle so I'm gonna go
08:48 - over here to our load data and I'm going
08:51 - to load the player image oh and by the
09:00 - way we did add an image folder to put
09:04 - all this stuff in so we're gonna add
09:09 - that that's wherever our game folder is
09:11 - and it's called
09:13 - just called IMG so that's where our
09:15 - stuff is going to live so we're gonna
09:19 - load showing that image folder with its
09:26 - called man you know what I'm gonna do is
09:31 - we're gonna we're just going to create
09:33 - some variables for this stuff so we're
09:34 - going to have a lot of new settings for
09:40 - the player so let's go over here to our
09:43 - player settings and we're gonna say that
09:45 - layer image is going to be it's called
09:50 - man blue let me double check the name
09:57 - underscore guttin dot PNG so that's the
10:01 - picture we want to use so we load it in
10:08 - the loading section of our game and in
10:10 - our sprite we can just use that here for
10:14 - our image player image and we don't want
10:20 - to fill it with yellow and that is all
10:25 - we need to do to get the image in there
10:26 - alright so there's my character so
10:31 - that's easy enough we still have the
10:35 - wall collision we have the rectangle
10:37 - being drawn around the sprite as you can
10:42 - see and then all works fine except of
10:46 - course we don't always want to be facing
10:49 - to the right like this that doesn't
10:51 - really work I want I need to be able to
10:54 - turn in all the directions and that is
10:56 - where we're going to have to make it
10:58 - decision a big decision here on how the
11:00 - gameplay is going to work okay and the
11:07 - big decision that we're gonna have to
11:09 - make here is what kind of movement do we
11:15 - want to allow now we could let's say we
11:18 - were sticking to four-way movement
11:20 - up-down left-right
11:21 - no diagonals right then we need to have
11:23 - the sprite turn right like this and face
11:27 - in the direction that we need it to
11:29 - point and that means that you can only
11:34 - shoot in those directions which makes it
11:36 - kind of hard when something is you know
11:39 - in a diagonal direction to you which
11:42 - means do we have eight positions and we
11:45 - rotate you know in between those if
11:48 - you've ever played a game that allows
11:49 - you like this that allows you to do
11:52 - diagonal shooting you have to hold down
11:54 - the two arrow keys and you're moving in
11:56 - that direction while you're shooting in
11:57 - that direction
11:57 - it gets pretty it gets pretty tricky our
12:01 - other option is to allow free movement
12:04 - all right you can turn at any angle in
12:06 - the face in any direction and I like
12:09 - that a little bitter so that's what
12:10 - we're going to do I can see now that
12:14 - we've already gone over a little a
12:16 - little over 12 minutes so we're going to
12:20 - do that in the next video I don't want
12:21 - to make this this video too long so at
12:25 - this point you should have gotten
12:28 - prepared we have our vectors in place
12:31 - for all all of our location and velocity
12:34 - and you have the player image in place
12:38 - if you've decided to use some different
12:40 - art just pick something that will work
12:43 - for you know top-down movement and
12:46 - something that will look okay when you
12:48 - rotate it to face in all directions I
12:53 - recommend you stick with the the Kenny
12:55 - game art packets are really nice packed
12:57 - because it's got a you know complete set
12:59 - of art and the link to it will be below
13:02 - in the comments and you can go and get
13:06 - that and be ready for the next video
13:08 - where we start talking about rotating
13:10 - our players right and all of the things
13:14 - that are going to come along with that
13:15 - and a couple of things that we will run
13:17 - into will be a little tricky to solve so
13:20 - we've got that to look forward to so I
13:23 - will see you in the next video thanks
13:24 - for watching
13:32 - you
