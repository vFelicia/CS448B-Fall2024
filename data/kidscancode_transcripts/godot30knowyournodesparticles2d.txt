00:00 - welcome to know your nodes where we pick
00:02 - an individual node in Godot and talk
00:04 - about how it's used this time we're
00:06 - looking at Godot 3.0 is particles 2d
00:08 - node which you can use to make all sorts
00:10 - of particle based visual effects on the
00:13 - screen are a few examples that we'll be
00:14 - looking at later in the video if you're
00:17 - new to Godot hopefully this will help
00:18 - you get started with particles and if
00:21 - you're familiar with go 2.1 you're gonna
00:24 - see that things are working quite a bit
00:26 - differently in 3.0 alright let's get
00:29 - started so we're starting with this
00:31 - torch image it's just a sprite and we've
00:35 - added a particles 2d node to it and the
00:38 - first thing you'll notice is you get a
00:40 - warning and that warning is telling you
00:42 - that a material needs to be assigned and
00:46 - so we're going to do that go to process
00:49 - material and you have two choices here
00:51 - you can use a shader material which
00:54 - means you're going to write shader code
00:55 - to handle the to handle the particles or
00:59 - you can use a particles material and
01:01 - that's what we're actually going to use
01:02 - and now you can see actually we have
01:04 - some basic white square particles being
01:09 - generated and they're falling down from
01:11 - the spot so what do we want to do well
01:14 - one thing we want to do is move this so
01:16 - that we're gonna want it to look like
01:18 - it's coming from inside the torch not
01:21 - outside it so we're gonna Center that
01:23 - over that and in the visibility section
01:27 - we're gonna check show behind parent
01:29 - because I want the particles to look
01:30 - like they're coming from inside the
01:32 - torch not on top of it
01:33 - okay we're emitting we're gonna take the
01:36 - time and I'm gonna increase that to two
01:39 - seconds on the lifetime and I think we
01:44 - are done there so now we need to go into
01:46 - this particles material and this is
01:49 - where all of your crazy number of
01:52 - settings are for all the different
01:54 - things you can have your particles do
01:55 - and we're gonna change a few things here
01:59 - starting with gravity I want these
02:01 - things to be going upwards not downwards
02:03 - and so I could go in and I could change
02:06 - the gravity which right now is set to
02:10 - positive in the y-direction but I'm
02:12 - going to set that to zero
02:13 - so we're gonna do this a little bit
02:16 - differently than the gravity is gonna
02:19 - make these move so we're gonna turn that
02:21 - off now we want to look at the emission
02:27 - shape here the mission shape is where
02:29 - the particles initially spawn and by
02:32 - default it's set to point so they're all
02:34 - going to spawn at the same point but
02:36 - we're gonna spread that out and we're
02:37 - gonna use a box and in here we're gonna
02:42 - set what the extents of the box are
02:44 - going to be and so we want to spread
02:46 - them out a little bit in X remember this
02:49 - is extents so it's five in either
02:51 - direction so it'll be a total of ten in
02:53 - width and then the Y we're gonna do
02:56 - about 18 so now these guys are spawning
03:02 - and all sorts of little places inside
03:05 - this box okay but our initial velocity
03:10 - which is right here is very small so if
03:14 - we were to increase that a bit let's try
03:18 - 25 you're gonna see that they're all
03:21 - flying out to the right but sort of
03:25 - spread out and part of that is because
03:27 - spread is set to 45 degrees so let's
03:30 - make that zero and now they're gonna be
03:33 - going in a straight line from wherever
03:35 - they spawn but they're going to the
03:38 - right and initial velocity is just a
03:40 - scalar value we can't set a direction so
03:43 - the way you have to solve that is back
03:45 - on your particles 2d you want to rotate
03:47 - it so let's rotate that - 90 degrees now
03:52 - they're spawning and going upwards so
03:55 - let's increase that velocity to 50 fire
03:58 - should be fairly quick and then we're
04:01 - going to talk about scale this is the
04:03 - size that you want the particles to be
04:05 - so if we increase that to say 25 we get
04:08 - much bigger colored squares for our
04:10 - particles but you can also use a scale
04:13 - curve to change the scale of the
04:15 - particle over its lifetime so if we
04:18 - click new curve texture and then click
04:21 - on that new curve we've made we get a
04:24 - new panel opened up here at the bottom
04:25 - where we can alter the
04:26 - so let's say we wanted to start it
04:30 - around there and then scale down to say
04:34 - just under halfway so this goes between
04:38 - zero and one it's a multiplier to that
04:41 - scale property you have back to
04:44 - properties we can look at the angle this
04:50 - is what angle they'll be rotated out
04:52 - we're going to make that 45 so they're
04:53 - more like diamond shapes instead of
04:55 - squares and then we're going to talk
05:00 - about speeding these things up so
05:03 - there's they're starting out at a
05:05 - certain speed but we want them to sort
05:07 - of accelerate as they're going upwards
05:09 - and we can do that with the linear
05:12 - acceleration so that's going to
05:14 - accelerate in whatever direction we're
05:16 - going so if we make that about 25 you'll
05:20 - see now we are accelerating upward as we
05:25 - go and you can see them moving upward
05:29 - that's good
05:30 - and let's go back to the particles 2d
05:34 - properties right now we're only spawning
05:37 - eight of these that's not very many so
05:40 - we're gonna take that and make that a
05:42 - much bigger number and now we need to
05:48 - talk about color just like we can change
05:51 - the scale over the course of the
05:53 - lifetime we can also change the color go
05:56 - down to color here and we're gonna add a
05:58 - color ramp which is a new gradient
06:00 - texture you click on that and we want a
06:05 - new gradient the gradients start out
06:08 - from black to white but we don't want
06:12 - that we want the initial color to
06:15 - actually be a bright white like it's
06:18 - super hot right at the beginning and
06:21 - then we want to end up at the end
06:25 - somewhere in the red we're also going to
06:28 - drop the Alpha a bit so it like it's
06:31 - fading out and then in the middle we're
06:36 - gonna add some orange
06:40 - so it passes through from white to
06:42 - orange to red as it goes so already
06:50 - looking much more fire-like now another
06:52 - thing we can do is look at the angular
06:58 - velocity and that's gonna give it some
07:00 - rotation and we're going to make that
07:03 - about 350 so you see them all spinning
07:08 - now right so they have a angular
07:09 - velocity of 360 but that's not as good
07:14 - when they're all going the same so if we
07:16 - add in some randomness here we can put a
07:18 - 1 in here and that'll randomize them in
07:20 - different directions so they're all
07:22 - spinning independently and that's good
07:27 - enough pretty close to the sample I
07:29 - showed you at the beginning the only
07:31 - thing that I had done differently was if
07:33 - you go back to particles 2d there is a
07:36 - speed scale and if you double that it'll
07:40 - just do everything twice as fast and
07:44 - there we have it a little flame from our
07:47 - torch here's the original one that I
07:50 - made beforehand pretty close to the same
07:56 - you can see there's all sorts of little
07:58 - tweaking you can do to get everything
08:00 - just the way you want it
08:02 - that's part of the fun of messing around
08:05 - with particles is is you know endlessly
08:09 - twiddling all these little knobs and
08:10 - getting them to do different things for
08:11 - you but that was the main example I
08:14 - wanted to show you now let's look at
08:15 - some other examples of some different
08:18 - kinds of effects you can get from
08:19 - particles here's another example this is
08:22 - almost the same setup almost exactly the
08:26 - same particle material settings with the
08:30 - scale and the color ramp going to a low
08:35 - alpha so it looks like it's fading out
08:36 - the reason it looks so realistically
08:39 - like smoke is that we're using a texture
08:41 - this time it's over here on the
08:43 - particles 2d you can set a texture and
08:46 - we're using this white smoke puffs on
08:50 - there and you can see it looks pretty
08:52 - good looks like
08:53 - smoke coming out and we can even put it
08:56 - to see what it looks like in a scene
08:58 - there we attach it to the little house
09:01 - sprite and it looks like you've got
09:03 - smoke coming out of the chimney
09:07 - something that you normally do is
09:09 - something like this is if you look at
09:10 - the house
09:13 - we took the smoke and made it a child
09:17 - like this and then in the visibility
09:22 - section check the show behind parent
09:25 - that way it looks like it's coming out
09:26 - of the chimney instead of on top of it
09:31 - but that gives you a pretty good effect
09:36 - and there you see it in context of a
09:42 - scene pretty good now another thing you
09:46 - can do with something like this smoke is
09:49 - attach it to a moving object so here's a
09:53 - train sprite and we've attached the
09:55 - smoke the same smoke particles to the
10:00 - smokestack but the problem is when you
10:02 - move the train that smoke stays right
10:05 - there with the Train and that's not
10:07 - going to look natural when the Train
10:08 - moves so what you want to do is in the
10:12 - particle settings you go down here to
10:15 - drawing and there's a checkbox by
10:17 - default it's on called local coordinates
10:19 - and that means the particles stay
10:23 - attached to the local coordinates of
10:24 - their parent now if you uncheck that
10:27 - they become global coordinates and that
10:29 - means that when you move the sprite the
10:33 - ones that have already been emitted are
10:35 - not affected by that movement all right
10:38 - they just come out wherever they are and
10:41 - that means that by adjusting some of the
10:43 - settings with speed and things like that
10:45 - we can get this result and actually in a
10:52 - running scene with the train moving
10:54 - you'll see it looks pretty good
10:59 - leaving the trail behind it as it goes
11:02 - and you could add in some more stuff to
11:04 - make it look more like it's chuck
11:06 - jugging and there's little gaps in the
11:09 - in the flow and all that kind of stuff
11:12 - and this acceleration this is the radial
11:16 - acceleration but we're also doing some
11:18 - tangential acceleration in the you know
11:22 - perpendicular direction of movement so
11:24 - that it streams out behind and you can
11:26 - increase or decrease that based on what
11:28 - your speed of your sprite is I'm going
11:33 - to go through a couple other examples so
11:34 - here we have a chest which is just an
11:37 - area 2d you that has a collision shape
11:39 - on it so that we can detect clicks and
11:42 - you're gonna click on this to collect
11:45 - coins and I'll show you what it looks
11:47 - like and then we'll talk about how this
11:48 - is done so there's our chest when we
11:51 - click on it we get the little shower of
11:52 - coins that comes up from it each time we
11:56 - each time we do it and so what we're
11:59 - doing there is we have our coin emitter
12:04 - and it's set to one shot one shot means
12:09 - it's only gonna happen once when you
12:11 - turn it to emitting the amount of
12:14 - particles is 10 when those 10 particles
12:15 - have have done it doesn't happen again
12:18 - right if we uncheck one shot that would
12:21 - be a constant stream and the reason
12:24 - there's that gap there is because we're
12:25 - using explosiveness explosiveness is how
12:28 - many of those ten to emit at once right
12:32 - for example if I put one on there all 10
12:35 - are emitted at once the default value is
12:37 - zero which means you get the steady
12:40 - stream so we wanted to just have a
12:44 - little burst of them and we wanted it to
12:47 - be one shot and then if you notice the
12:54 - animation of the coins the animation of
12:57 - the coins is accomplished by the texture
12:59 - the coin texture looks like this so this
13:03 - is a series of animation frames of the
13:05 - rotating coin and we set that as our
13:07 - texture and then we set the each frames
13:11 - to eight because there are eight
13:13 - frames to this animation and then to
13:16 - make that work in the particle material
13:20 - there is an animation section where you
13:24 - can set the speed and tweak it and all
13:27 - sorts of ways to make it run the way you
13:28 - want for a little bit more involved
13:31 - example of this I have this animation of
13:34 - a slime droplet coming off the ceiling
13:37 - and so this is the final frame this is
13:40 - where we want it to stop so we don't
13:42 - want it to loop and so I've set up a
13:45 - little slime dripping from the ceiling
13:50 - particle emitter here and so what's
13:54 - going on here is we've got seven frames
13:56 - of animation and in the particles
14:00 - material we're setting the initial we're
14:05 - setting the speed here but we've
14:06 - unchecked a loop so that when it reaches
14:08 - the drop it stays there but we've also
14:12 - added an acceleration curve and so this
14:15 - curve stays flat for the first part of
14:18 - the lifetime so the drop at the top
14:22 - doesn't move while it's there then the
14:25 - speed ramps up from there so that it
14:28 - starts falling and that's what gives us
14:31 - the following effect and just a couple
14:37 - other examples to give you some ideas
14:39 - here's a little one where whenever we
14:41 - drop the bombs they explode upon hitting
14:44 - so these are rigidbody
14:45 - two DS that delete themselves when they
14:51 - contact an object but they send out a
14:54 - signal to the scene to the parent scene
14:57 - so that it will spawn a particle emitter
15:01 - now a couple of limitations that
15:03 - particle emitters have one of them is so
15:06 - for the explosion you probably want to
15:08 - be you probably want to have it on one
15:11 - shot so that the explosion goes and then
15:13 - it's done but the problem is that when
15:17 - an explosion is or sorry went in it
15:19 - emitter is set to one shot when it
15:21 - finishes so see if I start it if I set
15:24 - it to one shot and let's set it to emit
15:26 - right it finishes the emitting the
15:29 - explosions done the emitting the
15:32 - property is still true so there's no way
15:35 - for us to tell in our code that this
15:39 - particle emissions is actually finished
15:42 - so what we had to do was just create a
15:45 - little timer and delete the particle
15:49 - emitter after enough time has gone by
15:52 - now there's an open issue for this on
15:54 - github so hopefully that gets resolved
15:57 - one way or another either with a mission
16:00 - complete signal or the emission property
16:04 - getting set back to false so you can
16:06 - check for that and you know we'll see
16:08 - how that goes but in the meantime if
16:09 - you're doing something like this and you
16:11 - need to get rid of your particle emitter
16:14 - after it's finished use a timer and you
16:17 - free it when that timer finishes another
16:21 - example is your classic space warp
16:23 - particle emitter where you have the
16:25 - particles coming out from the center of
16:27 - the screen like you're going into
16:28 - hyperspace which can be a lot of fun to
16:31 - play around with and make all sorts of
16:34 - different color effects and glow effects
16:37 - and things like that to give you that
16:40 - impression number of particles can make
16:42 - a huge difference here the key here to
16:46 - getting this effect is taking our
16:49 - texture which kind of an a glow an oval
16:51 - glow shape and in the material setting
16:55 - the align Y property because if we don't
16:58 - set that then the texture is oriented
17:02 - the same way just up and down but by
17:05 - checking a line Y it will align the
17:08 - y-axis of the particle with or the
17:13 - texture I should say with the particles
17:14 - direction and that will give you that
17:17 - much better streaming effect particles
17:21 - can really add atmosphere for example if
17:23 - I turn on the rain here we get one
17:25 - effect or if I turn it off and turn on
17:29 - this other one which I called upside
17:31 - down where we have all these little
17:32 - floaty particles that must mean
17:35 - something's not right
17:36 - and you want to be careful so I hope
17:38 - that gives you ideas for things you can
17:40 - try
17:40 - make on your own when it comes to
17:42 - particles the fun really is in tinkering
17:44 - and trying different things whenever you
17:46 - find something really cool save it
17:48 - somewhere because you never know when
17:49 - you'll need that effect in a game I'll
17:52 - post a link to this project below so you
17:54 - can download and play with it yourself
17:55 - make sure you have Godot 3.0 beta 1 or
17:58 - later thanks for watching and I'll see
18:01 - you next time
18:09 - you
