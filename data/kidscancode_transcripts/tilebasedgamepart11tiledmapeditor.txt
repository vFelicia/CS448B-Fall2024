00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:02 - Peggy this is part 11 of our tile based
00:05 - top-down shooter game and in this video
00:07 - we're going to be talking about a map
00:09 - editor called tiled which is a really
00:12 - powerful way to build your game maps and
00:14 - levels so we have our game working
00:18 - pretty well now the zombies they they
00:23 - move towards the player but they're not
00:24 - particularly smart about it and you know
00:28 - they will go on top of each other like
00:30 - that if they get stuck in a corner
00:31 - they'll just you know be right on top of
00:36 - each other there's lots of stuff we
00:38 - could still do can shoot them through
00:41 - here which is nice but before we go into
00:47 - improving our mob behavior and in doing
00:53 - any more graphical improvements I want
00:57 - to talk about our map right and so our
01:00 - map file if you remember looks like this
01:02 - and this is really great for games where
01:07 - you have not a lot of variety or or
01:12 - detail in your map and and to get an
01:17 - idea of what I mean by that let's look
01:19 - at the the art pack we're using right
01:22 - this is the the Kenny game art pack that
01:25 - we took our player and our zombies from
01:28 - and it comes with all this great art for
01:31 - making walls and furniture and all that
01:36 - kind of stuff and if you look at the
01:39 - sprite sheet it looks like this right
01:41 - there's a lot of tiles here and so if
01:45 - you imagine trying to lay out a map made
01:49 - of these tiles in this kind of style you
01:54 - would have to assign a different letter
01:56 - or a different character to each one of
01:59 - these right and every where you put that
02:02 - you put here it would look like a big
02:04 - jumbled mess would be really hard to
02:05 - keep track of what goes where and what
02:08 - it looks like and on top of all that
02:12 - things like this
02:14 - like when you want to put the the couch
02:16 - here
02:17 - alright the couch is not square right so
02:21 - it has some transparent portions to it
02:22 - where you see the floor below it so you
02:25 - have to have a floor tile with a couch
02:28 - tile on top of it so you need to have
02:32 - layers in your map and it all starts to
02:35 - get kind of complicated well that's
02:38 - where we can turn to some tools to help
02:42 - us out and what a lot of game developers
02:46 - will do if they're if you're working on
02:48 - a really big project is they'll build
02:51 - their own map editor program to use to
02:57 - lay out all their maps and place tiles
02:59 - where they want and while that's a
03:01 - that's a fun project on its own we can
03:05 - turn to the Internet to solve our
03:07 - problem and so we're looking at a
03:11 - program called tiled okay it's at map
03:13 - editor org and this is an open source
03:18 - tile map tool that is really popular
03:22 - really widely used it's supported in
03:24 - lots of different game engines and it's
03:27 - very powerful but it's also pretty easy
03:30 - to get started with so you want to go to
03:33 - map editor org if you click on download
03:35 - here you'll see that they have downloads
03:39 - for whatever operating system you're on
03:42 - so go ahead and pause the video and go
03:44 - and download this program because we're
03:47 - going to talk about how we work with it
03:51 - okay when you open up tiled this is what
03:55 - you're going to see and so the first
03:58 - thing we want to do is we want to make a
03:59 - new map and so you can go up to file new
04:02 - or you can just click on the new map
04:06 - icon right here if we click on that we
04:08 - have some choices to make
04:10 - now tiled will do isometric and
04:14 - hexagonal shaped tiles which is
04:18 - something for another game series we're
04:22 - going to stick to orthogonal which means
04:24 - straight up and down our grid is
04:27 - a top-down view so we're gonna use an
04:29 - orthogonal grid you don't need to worry
04:32 - about the layer format and the render
04:34 - order you can leave those as they are
04:37 - but what we want to talk about is the
04:39 - tile and map size so the tile size you
04:42 - want to set to what you want the tile
04:45 - size in your game to be right and we've
04:47 - been using 64 by 64 tiles so we're gonna
04:51 - set that and then you need to set how
04:54 - big your map is right how many tiles
04:55 - across and how many tiles down well I'm
04:58 - gonna do 50 by 30 se which means my full
05:04 - map is gonna be 3,200 pixels wide and
05:08 - 1920 pixels tall right which is much
05:13 - bigger than our game screen but we
05:14 - already have the scrolling camera so
05:16 - we're gonna be in good shape so that's
05:18 - our map so if we hit okay now we're
05:21 - gonna have a nice blank map of a 64 by
05:24 - 64 tiles okay now we want to import our
05:31 - tile sheet into here so we have all the
05:33 - graphics now very important that before
05:36 - you do this you move your spreadsheet
05:40 - file to the place where you want to have
05:42 - it before you start working with it in
05:44 - tiled because if you move it after
05:47 - you've made the map and saved it it
05:49 - becomes kind of a pain to get everything
05:52 - to get the the locations of the files
05:54 - right so I'm putting it in my image
05:56 - folder where my other graphics are all
05:58 - right this is the same spreadsheet we
06:00 - were looking at before okay and so over
06:04 - here in this window is where the tile
06:07 - sets are and it's blank because there
06:09 - aren't any well just like with the new
06:11 - map there's a button down here at the
06:13 - bottom that says new tile set and if I
06:16 - click on that I'm gonna get some more
06:19 - options so we can give this tile set a
06:22 - name because you might have more than
06:24 - one you might be using more than one
06:26 - tile set you can give them different
06:27 - names I'm just gonna call this the
06:29 - Kinney top down
06:32 - can you top down fat because that's what
06:34 - it comes from and then we need to browse
06:37 - to the location so we're just gonna hit
06:39 - browse
06:40 - and go into our image folder where we
06:42 - put the tile sheet and we open that up
06:45 - and it will automatically have put 64 by
06:50 - 64 in here assuming that we're going to
06:52 - use tiles that are the same size as our
06:54 - map which is usually what you want to do
06:56 - but if for some reason it doesn't say 64
06:58 - by 64 here you're gonna fix those and
07:01 - then if you remember from looking at
07:03 - from actually looking at our map this
07:08 - this sprite sheet the tiles have this
07:12 - gap in between them right they're all
07:16 - spaced out and so that is what we set
07:21 - here in the spacing so turns out those
07:24 - are 10 pixels you can go look at the
07:26 - image and measure them but I already did
07:29 - and there are 10 pixels apart ok so then
07:32 - I'm gonna click OK and there we go it is
07:36 - now over here in this window loaded all
07:38 - those tiles and put them in a grid and
07:43 - see I can click on different ones now if
07:45 - you didn't get the spacing right you'll
07:47 - see it won't have chopped them up
07:49 - properly and the tiles won't be looking
07:53 - correct you only get half of the chair
07:55 - or something so you should see the right
07:57 - spacing of all these things and like the
08:00 - big tree takes up 4 tiles because it's
08:02 - large that kind of thing ok you can also
08:09 - over here on the right hand side there
08:11 - is a zoom drop-down so you can zoom in
08:14 - and look at the tiles up close or zoom
08:17 - out and look at them from far away
08:20 - whatever is more convenient for you and
08:23 - the same thing with your map here this
08:25 - bottom right hand corner here is showing
08:27 - you the zoom level of your map right and
08:30 - so you'll zoom in on your squares now
08:33 - let's start with this green grass tile
08:36 - in the upper left hand corner of the top
08:38 - map
08:38 - ok if I go out here on the map and click
08:41 - you'll see I can place every time I
08:45 - click and I can actually just click and
08:47 - drag as well and I can paint my map with
08:51 - those grass tiles
08:53 - that's a really slow way of filling it
08:56 - all in so we could also click on the
08:58 - paint bucket tool here if I click on the
09:00 - paint bucket tool I can come out here
09:02 - and click and now you'll see if i zoom
09:04 - out my full map is filled in with grass
09:08 - and that's a pretty good way to start
09:12 - although it's very boring and it all
09:16 - looks the same right because every one
09:18 - of these tiles you can see that if you
09:20 - look close you can see the repeating
09:22 - pattern of grass well turns out there
09:25 - are multiple graph styles here so one
09:29 - thing I can do is I could highlight all
09:32 - of these grass tiles so let me do I'm
09:34 - going to hit undo this button right here
09:37 - to undo all that painting that we did go
09:41 - back to the blank map now
09:43 - if I go back to and I highlight these
09:47 - four grass styles then you can see I can
09:50 - stamp them all at once so that's another
09:53 - way to get a large bunch of tiles out
09:56 - there at once okay but that's not what I
09:58 - want to do either you can also highlight
10:02 - multiple tiles like this right so I
10:04 - select the four grass styles and I'm
10:07 - going to click on the whole picture of
10:10 - the dice here that puts it in random
10:12 - mode so now every time I click it's
10:15 - going to pick one of those four randomly
10:18 - so every time I click it's filling in
10:19 - differently so as I paint or fill it
10:23 - will randomly choose from those alright
10:27 - so I can go to the paint bucket and fill
10:29 - and now I have random bits of grass
10:36 - tiles all over the place okay and so my
10:38 - map is full of green grass let me zoom
10:43 - out all the way so we can see it there's
10:46 - my map full of green grass now what
10:50 - happens if we want to place a tree let's
10:53 - just put one tree on so I'm going to
10:55 - zoom back in and since we're gonna start
10:58 - in the upper right hand corner I'm gonna
11:01 - zoom I'm I'm I scroll up to the upper
11:03 - right hand corner let's say we want to
11:05 - put a tree well the trees were over here
11:08 - and let's see let's grab one of these
11:11 - small trees okay so here's a tree I want
11:13 - to put a tree well if I put the tree
11:16 - this happens because you see the tree
11:20 - tile its corners are a transparent so
11:25 - we've now replaced the tile of grass
11:27 - with the tile of it that's the tree but
11:31 - that's not really what we want what we
11:33 - want is we want that tree tile to be on
11:35 - top of the grass and that's where layers
11:38 - come in okay this first layer where we
11:41 - painted all of the grass I'm gonna click
11:44 - on the name here and I'm going to call
11:45 - this the ground because one of the
11:49 - really powerful things that tiled lets
11:51 - you do is draw everything with multiple
11:53 - layers right so if I add a new layer
11:56 - here again the little new button looks
11:58 - just the same I'm going to add another
12:00 - tile layer we're going to talk about
12:02 - what these other layers are for later
12:04 - but we're gonna add another tile layer
12:05 - okay and that tile layer we're gonna
12:07 - call trees okay so now I can click on
12:13 - either one trees is above ground and the
12:17 - lists so ground will be on the bottom so
12:20 - now if I click on trees and I click and
12:23 - place a tree now that tree I'll zoom in
12:26 - so you can see it better those in a
12:29 - little bit more now you can see that
12:32 - these trees are being placed and they're
12:35 - not removing the ground because they're
12:38 - on a separate layer that's being drawn
12:40 - on top of the ground and you can turn on
12:44 - and off different layers so you can see
12:47 - them better you can change their order
12:49 - obviously if I move the ground up on top
12:52 - of the trees you won't be able to see
12:53 - the trees because the ground will be on
12:55 - top of them so we definitely want the
12:57 - ground to be at the bottom but there are
12:59 - my trees showing up so I'm gonna save
13:02 - this and what I'm gonna do is I'm
13:04 - actually going to make a new folder
13:06 - called maps that we're gonna store all
13:09 - of our game maps in and you can see this
13:12 - is going to save in the TMX format
13:14 - that's tiled the format the tiled save
13:18 - things saves things in
13:19 - all right so let's just call this tiled
13:23 - one this is not going to be our game map
13:25 - this is just a test so we're just gonna
13:27 - call it that okay so now it's saved and
13:30 - ready for us to start talking about how
13:32 - we load it into our game so in the next
13:36 - video we'll talk about how you go about
13:37 - loading this tiled map into your game
13:41 - and using it as your game map in the
13:44 - meantime practice with tiled experiment
13:48 - a little bit see what you can draw using
13:49 - this great Kenny art pack and in the
13:54 - meantime if you would need some
13:56 - inspiration or you want to use my map I
13:59 - have made this map which is a little map
14:02 - where I drew for for my first level it's
14:07 - gonna be a little house where maybe this
14:09 - is where you start and the zombies start
14:10 - invading I haven't decided yet
14:12 - but I've decorated it a little bit it's
14:16 - got four layers
14:17 - okay so I'll show you we have a ground
14:20 - layer it's just the the bottom of
14:24 - everything right then we have the walls
14:26 - and that is going to be the walls of the
14:30 - house and any other objects and then I
14:34 - added some items in to make things look
14:37 - interesting and then for the very top
14:40 - layer I have a decorations layer which
14:43 - is just some more little frills and
14:45 - things to add to make things look a
14:46 - little more interesting so this is
14:49 - something you can start with I'm not
14:53 - totally finished with it yet I'm still
14:55 - deciding what to put over here on this
14:57 - side I was thinking of maybe a police
15:00 - station or something like that
15:02 - so we have our little town that you're
15:04 - starting out in or that your player
15:07 - lives in so this is going to be a map
15:10 - that we can use but go ahead and feel
15:11 - free to draw your own the techniques
15:14 - we'll use will be based on this one but
15:17 - you can do the same kind of thing with
15:19 - your own map alright and I will see you
15:22 - in the next video as always please go
15:26 - ahead and hit that like button and if
15:29 - you haven't subscribed already subscribe
15:31 - to the channel so you will get the
15:32 - videos as
