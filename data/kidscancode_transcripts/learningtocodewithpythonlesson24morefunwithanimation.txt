00:00 - welcome back to learning to code with
00:02 - python today we're going to have some
00:04 - fun by extending the animation example
00:06 - we made last
00:10 - time in our last video we learned how to
00:13 - create a ball object and use that ball
00:16 - object definition to create multiple
00:19 - balls that will bounce around the
00:23 - screen my question at the end of the
00:25 - last video was what if we wanted to not
00:28 - have three balls but we wanted to have
00:29 - one 100 Balls bouncing around the
00:32 - screen well of course we could say new
00:35 - ball four new ball five new ball six and
00:37 - so on and also remember to do them in
00:40 - the animation Loop but that would be a
00:42 - lot of typing and a lot of repetition so
00:45 - there's definitely a better way the
00:47 - better way is to use a property of
00:49 - objects in Python objects can be treated
00:52 - just the same as any other kind of
00:53 - variable which means that just like with
00:57 - a string variable or a integer variable
01:01 - for example we could put them in a list
01:04 - so why don't we make a
01:06 - list and add all of our balls to that
01:08 - list so we could make a list called
01:14 - balls and that's going to start out
01:16 - being an empty list nothing in
01:19 - it and now instead of
01:21 - creating balls individually what we're
01:24 - going to do is make a
01:26 - loop let's count to 100 and each time
01:30 - through this Loop we want to make a new
01:33 - ball and add it to the
01:35 - list well the command to add something
01:38 - to a list is take the list and you say
01:42 - do append append means add to the end of
01:46 - the list so what do we want to append we
01:48 - want to append a ball with and we'll
01:51 - start out just making them all be
01:54 - red and size
01:58 - 50 okay so now instead of creating these
02:02 - balls individually we've now got at the
02:05 - end of this Loop we've got a list called
02:07 - balls that has 100 individual ball
02:11 - objects in
02:12 - it so now all we need to do in here is
02:16 - tell our program that we want to move
02:19 - all 100 of those ball objects so we can
02:22 - use a loop for that as
02:23 - well and we can say for each ball in the
02:27 - ball
02:28 - list ball.
02:31 - move so we're going through we're doing
02:35 - a loop through the list of
02:37 - balls one at a
02:39 - time and we're using the variable ball
02:42 - to stand for each ball and then we're
02:44 - saying take that ball and move it now
02:47 - let's see what
02:55 - happens now the first thing you might
02:57 - notice is that doesn't look like 100
02:59 - Balls
03:00 - and they're all very clumped together
03:02 - right they're not spread out can you
03:04 - figure out
03:07 - why the answer is that each ball when
03:10 - it's created we give it a random X speed
03:13 - and a random YP speed but our choices
03:16 - for what those speeds could be is very
03:19 - small it's only between one and seven so
03:22 - out of the 100 Balls a lot of them are
03:24 - going to have the same speeds so they're
03:26 - all right on top of each
03:28 - other so let's make it spread out a
03:30 - little bit more and have a little bit
03:32 - more
03:33 - action so one thing we could do is we
03:36 - could increase this this number right to
03:40 - spread out the ball some more how about
03:43 - we go
03:45 - between positive and negative numbers so
03:48 - sometimes they'll be going to the left
03:50 - sometimes they'll be going
03:53 - up so let's see how much difference that
03:58 - makes there we go now now we have them
04:00 - much more spread
04:03 - out there's still a little bit of
04:05 - clumping because there's still not that
04:06 - many differences
04:08 - in the speeds so another thing we could
04:12 - do is we could change the sizes they
04:14 - don't all have to be the same
04:16 - size instead of having 50 here for every
04:19 - ball being the same size we could change
04:22 - that to a random number so let's say we
04:23 - wanted to make this
04:25 - random between 50 and
04:28 - 100
04:30 - right I just replaced that the number
04:34 - 50 with this command to pick a random
04:36 - number so now I'll
04:38 - have objects that are all different
04:42 - sizes there we
04:45 - go so some of them are fast some of them
04:48 - are slow some are bigger than others and
04:51 - here's a little question for you do you
04:52 - know why this one isn't moving at
04:56 - all well in our random speeds
05:00 - the X speed is anything between minus 10
05:02 - and 10 well zero is in between there and
05:05 - the YP speed is also between Min - 10
05:07 - and 10 and zero is between there so it's
05:09 - possible to get a random speed of zero
05:12 - and
05:15 - zero now how about the
05:18 - color well if you remember when we did
05:21 - our random colors in the turtle
05:24 - exercises we can do a random color by
05:28 - having a list and I've already
05:30 - typed one here with a bunch of bunch of
05:33 - colors in it and instead of them all
05:36 - being red I want to pick a random.
05:39 - choice of
05:43 - colors right remember the random. choice
05:46 - command tells the computer to pick
05:48 - something out of a
05:51 - list I've got a lot more
05:56 - color and you can play around with that
05:59 - change things things around try making
06:00 - the balls all be
06:03 - bigger maybe you want enormous um shapes
06:07 - bouncing
06:08 - around right they don't have to be
06:14 - circles you can get some pretty cool
06:16 - effects you want to change this
06:19 - into re
06:21 - rectangle now instead of creating ovals
06:24 - are balls are all rectangle
06:28 - shapes
06:36 - the last thing I want to point out and
06:37 - some of you might have already gone and
06:40 - tried this out is this number right here
06:43 - how many balls we're animating around on
06:45 - the
06:46 - screen well eventually remember your
06:51 - animation is happening in this Loop and
06:53 - the computer is going through this Loop
06:55 - and it's going through each object in
06:58 - the list and moving it
07:00 - each object in the list and moving it
07:02 - and then updating the screen and then
07:03 - trying to do it again the bigger this
07:06 - list gets the longer it's going to take
07:10 - the computer to do this step and the
07:14 - longer it's going to take to do this
07:16 - whole Loop which means that at a certain
07:19 - point things will start to slow down now
07:23 - where the Slowdown happens depends on
07:25 - how fast your computer is but for
07:28 - example and I'm going to sh these down
07:29 - again just so we can see it go back to a
07:32 - small size for example if I increase the
07:35 - number up to 500 now there's five times
07:37 - as many objects on the
07:41 - screen and it's still pretty
07:46 - smooth but what happens if I made
07:48 - it a
07:51 - thousand and double it
07:55 - again do you see how it's starting to
07:57 - get kind of
07:58 - choppy
08:01 - the computer can't move that many
08:02 - objects fast enough for the animation to
08:05 - still be
08:08 - smooth so that's about it for this
08:11 - program go ahead and experiment with it
08:14 - try making changes see what kind of
08:16 - effects you can get to
08:19 - happen have fun with it and
08:21 - see what you can make and I'll see you
08:24 - in the next
08:28 - lesson
