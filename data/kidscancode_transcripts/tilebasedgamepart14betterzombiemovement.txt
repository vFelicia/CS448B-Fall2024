00:00 - all right this is part 14 of our
00:03 - tile-based top-down shooter game and in
00:08 - this video we're going to talk about
00:09 - improving the way our really not very
00:14 - intelligent zombies move around so for
00:18 - this video what I've done is I've added
00:20 - a bunch of more zombies here onto the
00:23 - map so that all these zombies will spawn
00:26 - over on the other side of the house by
00:27 - the trees so that when we run our
00:30 - program you can see the main problem we
00:34 - have with our zombies which is they all
00:37 - come running at me and as you can see
00:42 - eventually they're gonna clump up and
00:44 - just become one zombie I can't even tell
00:46 - how many are chasing me all right this
00:49 - is kind of a problem because I can't
00:53 - tell how many zombies I'm fighting but
00:57 - also it just doesn't look good right so
00:59 - we want to have a little bit of behavior
01:03 - on our zombies I don't really want to
01:04 - call it AI because whoever heard of a an
01:07 - intelligent zombie but I want them to
01:10 - have some sort of behavior where they
01:11 - don't just bump into each other and then
01:16 - we can talk about some other things we
01:17 - can have them do but I definitely no
01:18 - want them clumping up like that so what
01:23 - do we want to happen well right now if
01:27 - we go into our mobs here our mobs are
01:30 - went too far down our mobs are just
01:32 - pointing themselves at the player and
01:36 - accelerating in that direction alright
01:40 - so they're just heading straight for or
01:41 - the player and that's fine but that
01:44 - makes them clump up so to make them
01:47 - avoid each other we want them to move
01:51 - away from any mobs any other mobs that
01:54 - have gotten too close to them and to
01:56 - illustrate that let's look at a picture
01:57 - here so I drew a little diagram here so
02:02 - here I've got a couple of different mobs
02:03 - right and so looking at this mob here in
02:07 - the center this green arrow represents
02:11 - that it wants to do to head straight for
02:13 - the player but then it's going to have
02:15 - an avoid radius it's going to have a
02:17 - circle where it's going to look for any
02:19 - other mobs that are inside that circle
02:21 - and those are the ones that are close to
02:24 - it and those mobs are going to generate
02:27 - vectors pushing it away from them so
02:30 - these two red arrows are just pointing
02:32 - directly away from the other mobs and
02:37 - then this one over here this one doesn't
02:39 - affect it at all because it's outside
02:41 - the radius and the size of this radius
02:44 - will be something that we can adjust to
02:46 - get the behavior we want so all three of
02:49 - these are going to be unit vectors so
02:51 - they're just they have a length of one
02:52 - they're just giving us direction all
02:55 - right so we want we have this direction
02:57 - this direction and this direction if we
02:58 - add them up we get this dotted line
03:01 - vector and then we take that dotted line
03:04 - and we multiply it by the mob speed to
03:06 - get the right length and so this is the
03:09 - direction that the mob will accelerate
03:10 - in so it's not gonna head straight for
03:12 - the player it's gonna head sort of
03:13 - towards the player but off to the side
03:15 - and the same thing will happen to these
03:17 - others on these this zombie will be
03:19 - heading sort of in this direction
03:21 - because it'll be wanting to get away
03:23 - from this one and so forth so that'll
03:27 - keep the mobs from getting right on top
03:28 - of each other okay so we're gonna go
03:32 - over to our settings here we've got some
03:38 - mob settings I'm going to add an avoid
03:42 - radius and we're just going to call that
03:46 - we're gonna call that 50 pixels it's a
03:49 - nice round number to pick for now and
03:52 - remember we have that mob mob speed
03:54 - that's the length we're gonna make our
03:58 - acceleration vector so here in the
04:00 - update what we want to do is we want to
04:04 - take our acceleration and we're gonna
04:06 - make our acceleration just be a unit
04:09 - vector to start with right to get that
04:12 - green arrow that I showed you in the
04:14 - picture and then we're going to say
04:18 - avoid mobs so I'm going to define a
04:21 - little method here that's going to go
04:24 - and
04:24 - figure out all those other vectors and
04:28 - give us the sum and then we can say take
04:35 - our acceleration and scale it to
04:40 - whatever our mobs be is okay so now we
04:45 - can just define our of the void mobs
04:51 - function what this is going to do is
04:55 - it's just going to go through and loop
04:56 - through all the mobs right it's going to
05:02 - loop through all the mobs and we don't
05:04 - want to include ourself so we'll skip
05:07 - over the mob that is the zombie that
05:12 - we're currently looking at and then we
05:15 - want to see what the distance is between
05:16 - the two well that's just self dot pause
05:19 - - mob pause right that's going to give
05:23 - us the arrow pointing from this mob to
05:29 - the zombie we're concerned with so
05:30 - there's an arrow pointing from the mob
05:32 - towards it so that's the direction we
05:34 - want to move move in because we want to
05:36 - move away from the other mob now if the
05:44 - length of that vector is less than 50
05:49 - and greater than zero because if two
05:54 - mobs do happen to get on top of each
05:55 - other then their length is going to be
05:57 - zero so we want to take our acceleration
06:03 - and we just want to add that distance
06:08 - normalized which is make it a length of
06:12 - one right so now we that's what's going
06:16 - to get us each of those little red
06:18 - arrows from the diagram all right a
06:22 - let's call it up one more time here
06:27 - so we're looping through saying look at
06:30 - every mob look it's looks at this one
06:31 - too far away looks at this one that's
06:35 - our self we don't look at that
06:36 - looks at this one and says okay
06:38 - our position - the mob position gives us
06:41 - this vector which normalized will be a
06:44 - length of one and the same with this one
06:46 - right and then we're just we just keep
06:49 - adding them together to the acceleration
06:52 - we already have we add this one then we
06:54 - add this one and that's going to give us
06:55 - our final direction so we have the final
07:00 - direction and we scale that to length
07:03 - all right and then oh and I noticed I
07:06 - wrote 50 here I meant to say this should
07:09 - be avoid avoid radius right because we
07:11 - want to be able to adjust that if it
07:13 - turns out it's not working very well
07:15 - where we want the mobs to look further
07:17 - away or not so far away so let's take a
07:20 - look at it and see how it turns out okay
07:23 - so I'm gonna run over here to where all
07:26 - these mobs are and remember how it
07:28 - looked last time where they all clumped
07:30 - up together and wound on top of each
07:32 - other and look at that that looks so
07:34 - much better these zombies are clumping
07:38 - up but they are staying spread out it
07:41 - also helps them get around obstacles
07:43 - because they're gonna push each other
07:44 - around and it means that these zombies
07:48 - have become a bit more challenging
07:50 - because as they get close to you they're
07:53 - gonna start to surround you on all sides
07:55 - because they will fan out see that so
07:58 - you got to be really careful not to let
08:01 - them get you in a corner because you're
08:04 - not gonna be able to get out so that
08:07 - looks a lot better okay now another
08:13 - thing we can do to keep the mobs from
08:16 - looking so all the same is adjust their
08:22 - speeds of it give them make some of them
08:25 - a little faster and some of them a
08:26 - little slower right maybe some of the
08:28 - zombies are a little bit more decayed
08:29 - and don't move quite as fast and so we
08:33 - can instead of them all being this mob
08:36 - speed each zombie we spawn will either
08:41 - add or subtract a little bit from that
08:44 - so how about we instead make this a list
08:48 - and we say these are the speeds they
08:52 - could have right some of them will be
08:55 - 150 some of them will be oops some of
09:02 - them will be a hundred maybe 75 maybe
09:06 - 125 right I've just got a range of a few
09:10 - different speeds right and if you want
09:13 - to you can add you know make 150 in
09:17 - there twice you would get it more often
09:18 - that kind of thing
09:20 - so we can spread it out just so it's not
09:24 - totally random you know I could do a
09:27 - Rand range between you know 75 and 150
09:30 - and then one mob might have a speed of
09:33 - 87 and one mob has a speed of 93 and
09:35 - that kind of thing I just want a few
09:38 - different ranges so I'm gonna just have
09:40 - this little list so over here on my mob
09:44 - I can just say when this mob spawns its
09:48 - self dot speed is gonna be a random
09:51 - choice which means I need to go up here
09:55 - an import choice from random as well
09:59 - alright so speed is going to be choice
10:02 - mobs mob speeds right and then here we
10:10 - just scale it to our self dot speed okay
10:14 - so that way our zombies will have
10:16 - different speeds so let's take a look
10:19 - and see how that looks that's a slow one
10:29 - yeah so you see how some of them are
10:32 - trailing behind a little bit
10:38 - not bad that 75 might be a little too
10:45 - slow okay so you really got to be
10:54 - careful to get them they're gonna try
10:59 - and get on all sides of you and your
11:01 - poor pathetic little gun can only shoot
11:04 - in one direction still not too hard
11:09 - though and that's okay we're not trying
11:13 - to make the game we're not trying to get
11:15 - the final balancing done yet and make
11:17 - the game super hard we're just trying to
11:19 - get the basic functions working and then
11:21 - we will adjust as we go cuz you're never
11:24 - gonna get it perfect - right first time
11:25 - and then you're gonna add something and
11:27 - then it's not going to be right anyway
11:29 - so you want to get the mechanics working
11:31 - first before you worry about all the
11:34 - little balance details like how much
11:35 - damage does each bullet - and how fast
11:37 - does each zombie run right we're going
11:39 - to wind up adjusting those things anyway
11:41 - as we go okay so that'll do it for this
11:47 - video it was pretty plain 'less it's a
11:50 - pretty small amount of code we added
11:52 - here to give us a big improvement in how
11:55 - our zombies move around the map those of
11:59 - you who've been watching my in-depth
12:01 - videos on steering behaviors you
12:03 - probably see where some of this is
12:05 - headed we're gonna want to have these
12:08 - zombies just wander around randomly
12:12 - right now they chase the player from all
12:15 - the way across the map and so we'll want
12:18 - to make it so that the zombies can only
12:19 - chase the player if they're inside a
12:22 - certain range and and so will gradually
12:27 - start adding some more those behaviors
12:28 - to get these zombie zombies to look even
12:31 - better alright and as usual please click
