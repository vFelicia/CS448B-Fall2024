00:00 - welcome back to game development of pi
00:02 - game this is part 8 of our tile based
00:05 - game and in this video we will talk
00:07 - about how to handle our mob movement
00:10 - having it chased the player and collide
00:14 - with the walls properly ok let's look at
00:18 - where we are so far we have the player
00:22 - who can run around the screen and we
00:24 - have some zombie mobs that we can spawn
00:28 - that currently cannot move but they can
00:32 - follow the players location or they can
00:34 - watch the players location so I always
00:37 - turn so that they're always pointing at
00:40 - the player so now we want to make these
00:46 - mobs chase our player around so I'm
00:51 - going to add a couple more vectors here
00:54 - I'm going to add a velocity vector
00:56 - that's going to be how fast the mob is
00:59 - moving and I'm also going to add an
01:02 - acceleration vector and the reason I'm
01:03 - going to do that is so that the zombie
01:06 - doesn't turn on a dime you know
01:09 - instantly change direction if we move
01:11 - past the zombie then it's going to turn
01:14 - towards us but it's going to need to
01:17 - slowly change its direction so it will
01:20 - look more like it's running than if it
01:23 - then it's instantly you know changing
01:26 - direction and turning on a dime so we
01:29 - have these two variables to track that
01:33 - so we already know what direction the
01:37 - player is in because we've turned to
01:39 - point at that so our rotation variable
01:42 - is going to tell us what direction we
01:43 - want to accelerate and to move towards
01:45 - the player so our acceleration is just
01:51 - going to be something and what we can do
01:56 - is we can go over to our settings here
01:58 - and we're going to add a new variable
02:01 - here called the mob speed this is gonna
02:03 - be this is gonna control how fast our
02:05 - mobs are going to run and we're gonna
02:09 - make that be a little bit slower we
02:13 - don't want them to be as fast as I
02:16 - pastor than our player at least not yet
02:17 - I'm gonna set that to 150 okay so now we
02:27 - have our wrong file there so we have our
02:31 - vector our vector is just going to be
02:34 - mob speed all right we want to run in
02:37 - the forward direction rotated at
02:41 - whatever our rotation is okay and then
02:48 - that's going to accelerate the player in
02:52 - the right in the right direction okay
02:56 - alright and then I want to take these
02:59 - velocity and that's just going to be the
03:04 - acceleration times the games DT and then
03:11 - our position is going to be the velocity
03:17 - times the DT plus one half of one half
03:25 - of the acceleration times the DT squared
03:31 - and that comes from our equations of
03:34 - motion which if you haven't watched the
03:37 - previous video where I talked about the
03:41 - equations of motion I'll link to that
03:43 - below and now we know where our sprite
03:48 - should be so I'm just going to set the
03:50 - rectus enter equal to self dot pause
03:55 - okay so that's going to be enough for
03:57 - the moment now let's just make sure this
04:01 - works I'm going to get rid of these
04:02 - other mobs I only want to have one to
04:04 - deal with at the beginning okay so let's
04:09 - run this and let's see what happens
04:11 - oops and we have a little typo here
04:14 - that's supposed to be plus equals
04:18 - all right so now my mob is going to
04:20 - accelerate towards my player right so
04:23 - you see him accelerating towards the
04:24 - player but he's very floaty right he
04:29 - takes a long time to turn around and
04:31 - come back because he has no friction so
04:37 - he's accelerating towards me at a
04:39 - constant rate which makes him go faster
04:41 - and faster and faster and then he cannot
04:45 - stop so we need to slow him down a
04:49 - little bit or basically make him have
04:52 - some resistance against his movement add
04:54 - some friction and a simple way to do
04:58 - that is once we've figured out what our
05:01 - acceleration is our direction we're
05:05 - going to take the acceleration and we're
05:07 - going to add a little bit to it we're
05:14 - going to add a little bit of negative
05:19 - value to the acceleration based on how
05:21 - fast he's going so that's going to
05:23 - basically the faster he's going the
05:25 - higher this number will be so the less
05:27 - he'll accelerate so he's going to hit a
05:29 - maximum speed that he can't go faster
05:31 - than okay and there we go
05:34 - so you see him chasing after me but he
05:39 - has a maximum speed he doesn't keep
05:41 - accelerating sexy he's hit to maximum
05:43 - speed okay so now he can chase me around
05:49 - and I can run away but of course he has
05:55 - a big advantage over me because he is
06:00 - not stopped by the walls right so I need
06:04 - him to collide with the walls in the
06:07 - same way that the player does which
06:11 - means we need to do the same thing we
06:12 - did with the player where we took the
06:16 - movement and we broke it down into the X
06:19 - component and the y component and tried
06:23 - to collide with the walls in both now I
06:27 - could take this
06:29 - collide with walls and I could copy and
06:32 - paste it right and I could take this
06:34 - whole thing copy and paste this down
06:35 - into my mob class and have it work for
06:39 - that as well problem with that becomes
06:41 - what happens when I decide I want to do
06:44 - this a little differently I'm gonna have
06:46 - to change it in more than one place
06:48 - right copying and pasting is always a
06:49 - bad idea it means there's probably a
06:52 - better way to do it and the better way
06:54 - to do it would be to take this function
06:55 - and remove it from the player and make
07:00 - it a function that any sprite can use
07:02 - okay so we're gonna take that and we're
07:08 - going to paste this up at the top here
07:12 - okay
07:13 - so this is gonna be a new function we're
07:17 - going to indent that whoops nope we're
07:20 - good okay so this is a new function and
07:23 - what this function is gonna do is it's
07:25 - no longer a method in a class so it
07:28 - doesn't have a self anymore it's just
07:31 - gonna take a sprite and some group and
07:35 - in the direction okay and so I just need
07:39 - to take everywhere I have self by itself
07:45 - here self is going to change to sprite
07:50 - so if right Val right all this kind of
07:57 - stuff so I'm going to take I'm just
07:58 - hitting command D control D if you're on
08:01 - Windows to grab every time I see the
08:06 - word self and select it so that I can
08:09 - change that to sprite okay and then the
08:15 - other thing is the thing we collide with
08:17 - is not going to be game dough balls
08:20 - we're gonna say group here so we're just
08:22 - passing it to the sprite we want to
08:23 - collide with in the group we want to
08:25 - collide with okay now everything else
08:27 - will stay the same we don't to change
08:29 - anything else about that so now for the
08:33 - player to use that we need to go back
08:36 - over here and it's no longer self
08:38 - oops no longer self collide with walls
08:42 - right it is just collide with walls and
08:46 - what we have to do is tell it what
08:50 - sprite to use which is self and the
08:55 - walls and we can make sure that that is
09:00 - working by going over here and making
09:03 - sure that we still collide with the
09:05 - walls okay but now we can do this exact
09:10 - same thing with the mob and we can have
09:14 - the mob work the same way so all right
09:18 - we're going to take this and we're going
09:19 - to split this into two and move the
09:24 - center X and they Center Y separately
09:27 - just like we did with the player and
09:32 - that will let us use that function in
09:35 - the same way so Center X center Y self
09:37 - dot pause X pause dot y and then we say
09:45 - just collide with walls self X and then
09:56 - I'll duplicate that so I left off the
10:00 - quote there and we shift that down and
10:04 - we call that one y alright now if we go
10:10 - and run that we should see our mob OOP I
10:15 - remember what we left off the mob also
10:18 - now needs a hit rect remember we had to
10:24 - have the separate rectangle that did not
10:27 - change proportions as our sprite rotated
10:29 - so we need a hit rect for our mob and so
10:34 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put that
10:36 - in the settings too cuz that's going to
10:38 - be something we might want to adjust so
10:42 - the mob hit rect the mob hit correct is
10:45 - going to be
10:51 - there's a little smaller than the player
10:53 - we'll see how it works I just want to
10:55 - put something in there and let it work
10:59 - so go down here to our class mob and
11:02 - then when we when we start the mob right
11:08 - we need to use that hit rect
11:11 - so we're gonna say hit rect we want a
11:24 - copy of that we're going to have more
11:25 - than one gonna have lots of mobs so
11:28 - everyone is gonna be a have a hit rect
11:30 - if it's a copy of this one in the
11:32 - settings and we set our hit rec center
11:38 - equal to the rec center and then we just
11:45 - need to in our update we move our hit
11:50 - rect here not our regular right our hit
11:55 - rect gets adjusted by at the collide
11:57 - with walls function and then we just set
12:01 - our regular rect equal to wherever that
12:07 - hit rect wound up after colliding with
12:09 - the walls okay so now our mob should run
12:15 - into the walls and I can even probably
12:18 - get him stuck on the wall yeah so you
12:20 - can't go through there if I Cove fast
12:22 - enough he's gonna be stuck he can't go
12:25 - through the wall haha okay more progress
12:32 - he's got a lot done this time around but
12:35 - that will be it for this video we now
12:37 - have our mobs moving properly and
12:41 - running into the walls like they're
12:43 - supposed to and in the next video we can
12:45 - start talking about how we could have
12:48 - the mobs injured the player when they
12:51 - hit him and we could also talk about how
12:52 - we're going to defend ourselves so I'll
12:55 - see you next time in the meantime please
