00:00 - welcome back to Goodell 101 this is part
00:02 - 11 and we're going to be talking about
00:04 - how to create animated sprites so here
00:08 - is our players team and in our arts
00:12 - folder we have all the art for the idle
00:14 - the jumping and the running animations
00:17 - and we just want to use those to make
00:20 - this character look animated well that
00:23 - means we can't use the plain old sprite
00:26 - what we're going to use instead is the
00:28 - animated sprite and we could add that
00:32 - node but a shortcut here is we can
00:34 - right-click on this and say change type
00:36 - now I want to change it into an animated
00:39 - sprite okay so now all the textures have
00:43 - gone away and we have a warning here
00:47 - that's bright frames resource must be
00:50 - created our animated sprite needs to
00:52 - know what frames it's going to use so
00:55 - that's the first property right your
00:57 - frames click the down arrow and choose
01:00 - new and then click the right arrow to go
01:03 - into that frame and you're going to see
01:06 - a new panel open up here so over here
01:10 - you can define multiple animations over
01:15 - here in this section you're going to put
01:19 - the individual frames in the order you
01:21 - want them and over here you're going to
01:24 - put the speed how fast you want that
01:26 - animation to play and whether you want
01:29 - it to loop or not so let's start with
01:32 - idle the idle animation just uses these
01:37 - two frames I'm going to drag them into
01:40 - the animation frames window here and now
01:46 - if we go to our sprite we have a
01:51 - property you're called playing we turn
01:54 - that on and there you see it playing ok
01:58 - now I think that's a little sass so if
02:01 - we click back into the animation frames
02:03 - we can change the speed here to say 3
02:08 - there we go now let's talk about adding
02:12 - the running frame there's six frames to
02:14 - that animation so we're going to click
02:17 - on new animation call this running and
02:22 - then I'm going to select all of these
02:24 - and drag them into there we're going at
02:29 - one through six and back to our sprite
02:34 - right here this animation properties
02:37 - which one of those animations we want to
02:38 - use so if I switch it to running now
02:41 - we've got the running animation I think
02:44 - that one needs to be sped up just a
02:46 - little bit so I'll depend on what it
02:51 - looks like once we see it that you get
02:54 - the idea so now in our code what we're
02:58 - going to need to do is tell the animated
03:03 - sprite node which would be the
03:06 - animations to play it when we're running
03:08 - to use this one and when we're standing
03:10 - still to use that one and then we're
03:13 - also going to use our flip h property to
03:18 - change this direction it's running or
03:22 - standing it okay so here we are in our
03:27 - player script and I've added a reference
03:29 - to the sprite node this as the name and
03:33 - we're just going to add a new variable
03:36 - for which animation we're going to be
03:40 - using idle or running and then in our
03:45 - fixed process this is where we're going
03:47 - to choose which one to use let's set the
03:53 - animation so first of all if our X
03:55 - velocity is equal to zero then the
04:00 - animation we're going to use is the idle
04:03 - one otherwise bring is the run one
04:12 - that's pretty simple but now we need to
04:15 - detect the or we need to choose the flip
04:19 - H whether we want it to be facing to the
04:22 - right or facing to the left so if Delta
04:26 - X is greater than zero then we're
04:29 - running to the right so our sprite needs
04:34 - to be set to native set foot H to false
04:42 - that's the normal Direction is facing to
04:45 - the right and then if it's less than
04:49 - zero we'll do the same thing but look
04:54 - set flip H to true
04:59 - notice this way if when we stop moving
05:01 - the flip H won't change so we'll stay
05:04 - facing the direction we we're already
05:05 - going then we just need to tell our
05:08 - sprite to play whatever animation we're
05:14 - supposed to be playing and that's well
05:17 - fine except you're going to notice
05:18 - something a little bit weird run back
05:22 - and forth when I stop I am NOT going
05:25 - back to idle am I I'm sort of staying in
05:30 - the running state and the reason for
05:33 - that is we could to switch to idle if
05:36 - velocity X is zero but slot to the X is
05:40 - slowly getting smaller and smaller but
05:45 - it is a floating point number and it's
05:47 - never going to be exactly zero so what
05:51 - we need to do is we need to set
05:53 - basically a minimum speed threshold to
05:57 - stop moving so if the velocity X is less
06:03 - than say 10 you make our velocity X
06:08 - equal to zero and that way that last
06:11 - little invisible bit of coasting that's
06:13 - happening it's going to make us stop
06:25 - so there's also the jump animations
06:28 - where we have a image for when the
06:31 - player is falling downwards and one for
06:33 - when they're jumping upwards but I'm
06:36 - gonna hold off on that I'm going to
06:37 - leave that for you to experiment with
06:39 - see if you can figure out how a good way
06:42 - to add those into animations here
06:46 - remember you can set the hint here is
06:48 - you can set loop to off here and you can
06:52 - actually set in the properties you can
06:56 - set what frame you want to be on so if
06:58 - it's not playing you can say use frame
07:01 - zero use frame 1 and then that might
07:08 - help you figure out how to choose
07:09 - between the up and the jumping up in the
07:11 - falling images what I'm going to do is
07:16 - make the platform's look a little better
07:19 - so in our art folder we have a nice
07:23 - grass block here that we can use it's 64
07:26 - by 64 image so our platform if we drag
07:32 - that in it's going to be all stretched
07:36 - and ugly right because we've scaled it
07:39 - so let's bring that back to one so
07:43 - that's that's our grass block but I
07:47 - don't really want it to just be this big
07:49 - I want to be able to make it however
07:51 - wide I like and the way we're going to
07:55 - do that is by going into the texture and
07:57 - making sure you have repeat selected and
08:02 - you have met sweat then go back to your
08:09 - sprite and select region and now you'll
08:15 - see that the brightness sort of
08:19 - disappeared right that's because we need
08:21 - to tell it what the region rectangle is
08:24 - all right well we know the height is 64
08:26 - because that's how big our
08:29 - kyle is but we wanted to be wider let's
08:33 - say I want to do 10 tiles live let's
08:35 - just type 10 times 64 there you go now
08:40 - you have a 640 wide tile and it just
08:44 - repeats let's turn off the glue actually
08:46 - you just repeat to the tile over and
08:49 - over again that many times so it's super
08:52 - handy and then we just need to make sure
08:55 - our collision matches that collision
08:58 - shape matches the size the tool too
09:02 - small we're running 32 before will
09:07 - increase that and now our platforms are
09:13 - going to look much nicer to run around
09:18 - on
09:25 - and finally let's just make the
09:27 - background look about it a little bit
09:28 - better - that sounds great simple we've
09:30 - got a fixture here for that
09:32 - and on the main you're just going to add
09:34 - a sprite to hold it and we're going to
09:39 - put that first because you want it to be
09:44 - find everything else drop that in the
09:47 - texture and there we go this is a really
09:51 - big image so when you drag it around
09:55 - it's going to take up a lot of space so
09:57 - we can scale it as well all right if you
10:07 - want it a little bit smaller like the
10:10 - screen size put it like that and then
10:14 - you can do the same thing by the way
10:16 - with the backgrounds with the region and
10:18 - if you want it to repeat and have a if
10:21 - you have a scrolling background you just
10:23 - want to have a repeat over over again
10:24 - but that's something we will get to in a
10:27 - later video well there we go with a nice
10:30 - background find our platforms okay
10:38 - thanks for watching as always please
10:40 - like and subscribe and I will see you in
10:43 - the next video
10:51 - you
