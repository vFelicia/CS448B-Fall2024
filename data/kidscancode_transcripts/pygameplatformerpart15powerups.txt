00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:01 - pygame this is part 15 of our platformer
00:05 - game and in this video we will be adding
00:08 - power-ups okay so before we go too far
00:14 - into the power-ups there's one thing I
00:17 - wanted to do to talk about about the
00:20 - platform collisions now you may have
00:22 - noticed this and it's kind of should be
00:26 - obvious why it's happening but if you
00:27 - stand over here on the edge you can look
00:29 - like you are floating in space right
00:32 - because there we go so the hitbox of my
00:36 - player is just still barely touching the
00:41 - hitbox of the platform so the you know
00:45 - our code is seeing this as a collision
00:47 - and of course it happens over here too
00:49 - and you know that's a little weird we
00:52 - shouldn't be able to jump when we're
00:54 - standing in them in midair like that so
00:57 - fortunately there's an easy solution to
00:59 - this and since we're using the X the
01:02 - center here as our position for our
01:03 - player we can just say when that
01:05 - position if that position extends past
01:10 - the edge of the platform on either side
01:13 - then we won't collide we won't stop
01:16 - falling okay so we can go down to our
01:20 - platform collision code right and this
01:22 - little this if statement here is what
01:25 - puts us on the top of the platform stops
01:28 - us from falling so basically we'll only
01:30 - want to do that if our player is between
01:34 - the the left and right edge of the
01:37 - platform so we can say if the players
01:42 - pause X is less than the platform that
01:48 - we're hitting right and the player
01:54 - pause X is greater than the lowest rect
02:00 - left now you'll notice this line is
02:04 - getting pretty long right that's a
02:06 - really long line and long long lines are
02:10 - kind of a pain there's a couple
02:12 - things you can do to solve that I mean
02:14 - Python does let you do this if you put a
02:16 - backslash and you continue around then
02:20 - you can you can say this it sees this as
02:26 - one line right so it doesn't count as
02:29 - two separate lines we do want to indent
02:32 - the F now that's not super pretty but
02:35 - it's good enough for now so let's see
02:37 - what this looks like
02:40 - okay so I'm hitting this platform
02:43 - because my exposition is less than this
02:47 - spot and it's greater than this spot so
02:50 - let's go over to a platform where we can
02:52 - fall off now watch as I reach the edge
02:55 - there we go see how so that is not
02:59 - counting as a collision right I'm
03:02 - falling right off the side as soon as my
03:04 - Center gets that site but that doesn't
03:08 - quite look right because my foot should
03:10 - still be touching so we want to give
03:12 - that a little bit extra space so we're
03:16 - gonna say I'm just gonna add a little
03:18 - bit to the little extra ten pixels on
03:22 - either side and I just picked 10 out of
03:26 - thin air just to see what it looks like
03:29 - so let's get up to one where we can fall
03:31 - so now I can walk to there my foot still
03:35 - touching oh and it I fall okay so
03:40 - you can see that looks much better it
03:43 - looks much more natural especially when
03:45 - we walk off the edge that we fall when
03:49 - our feet aren't on the edge supporting
03:52 - us okay on to power ups now power ups
03:59 - are gonna be objects that are gonna that
04:01 - are gonna spawn on the screen and for
04:06 - these I want these power-ups to spawn
04:09 - attached to a platform so I don't want
04:12 - them floating in mid-air or or kind of
04:14 - half overlapping a platform I want them
04:16 - to be resting on platforms like their
04:18 - objects that are sitting there that
04:20 - we'll go find so so when we make the new
04:23 - sprite and I'm just gonna go ahead and
04:24 - I'm gonna copy some of this stuff so I
04:29 - don't have to retype it alright bad
04:35 - indenting there we go
04:39 - okay so so what we want to do is we're
04:44 - gonna call this I'm just gonna call this
04:46 - a pal for powerup okay now when we spawn
04:50 - a powerup we're just gonna pass it a
04:53 - platform that you know we're gonna so
04:56 - we're gonna pass it what platform it
04:58 - needs to be sitting on so that way it'll
05:00 - know where it needs to be and so we're
05:05 - gonna do in itself game will keep track
05:12 - of that platform we don't have a list of
05:16 - images I don't need that but we do need
05:21 - our image sorry so first of all we are
05:24 - gonna have multiple types of platforms
05:26 - now to start with I'm going to do we
05:32 - import yes we imported choice okay
05:37 - I'm gonna just have one platform or I
05:41 - mean I'm sorry one type of power up to
05:44 - start with and that's a boost one that
05:45 - shoots you upwards later we can have
05:49 - more and we can improve this randomness
05:52 - here and choose different random ones
05:53 - what
05:54 - we want to do but for now we're just
05:58 - gonna stick with one and the boost image
06:02 - is going to be over here in our
06:06 - spreadsheet it's this little jetpack so
06:13 - we're gonna use that set the color key
06:15 - to black get the rectangle in our
06:17 - location so our where we place the where
06:25 - we place the powerup sprite is just
06:27 - going to be at the center of the
06:31 - platform and then the bottom of the
06:35 - sprite will be at the top and a little
06:42 - bit up so I just want to look like it's
06:44 - sort of just barely floating right there
06:46 - above it now as far as the update for
06:53 - our sprite we're gonna just make sure we
06:58 - keep we just want to keep the bottom of
07:01 - the sprite at that point right so that
07:06 - way if the put when the platform moves
07:08 - so will the power and if now if we want
07:17 - to delete these these power-ups when the
07:21 - platform disappears right and the
07:22 - platform so the platform's go off the
07:24 - bottom and then they disappear right
07:25 - that means this self dot plat won't
07:29 - exist anymore so we get an error message
07:31 - so we want to make sure we delete the
07:33 - sprite whenever our the powerup sprite
07:37 - whenever the platform sprite gets
07:38 - deleted
07:39 - so we can do that by using the self dot
07:43 - game dot platform's group right that
07:45 - group has a list of all the platform's
07:48 - right and they get removed from that
07:49 - group when they go off the bottom and
07:53 - get deleted so in PI game with groups
07:57 - you can do you can do the halves command
08:00 - and this will return true or false so
08:04 - this this command will be true or false
08:05 - whether the platform
08:08 - in the platform group and if it doesn't
08:10 - so if this is false then we will delete
08:16 - the powerup sprite as well okay so
08:19 - that's our powerup sprite now we have to
08:23 - talk a little bit about groups some more
08:26 - so you recall if I go back over here to
08:30 - our new we have these we have these
08:33 - groups where we are placing the
08:37 - different sprites in right we add the
08:39 - player to the all sprites group when we
08:42 - spawn a platform we added to both groups
08:44 - that starts to get tedious having to do
08:47 - this right we had to do that here down
08:48 - here when we spawn some new platforms we
08:51 - also have to add it to both right well
08:54 - there's an easier way to handle groups
08:58 - and that way is if we go over here
09:02 - actually real quick let me make a we're
09:06 - gonna need a group for power-ups so that
09:07 - we can do the collision so I'm gonna say
09:13 - power-ups is a PG sprite group right now
09:18 - so the game has these three groups and
09:21 - we know we're gonna be wanting to add
09:23 - different sprites to them so we can do
09:24 - that instead of doing it as a separate
09:28 - command every time we spawn the sprite
09:30 - we can do it when the sprite is actually
09:34 - initiated so let's see here so we'll
09:38 - start with our power up here so if we
09:40 - make a list here right when right before
09:46 - and it's important we do this before the
09:48 - sprite class in it okay we name a list
09:54 - of groups so in this case we want game
09:56 - dot all sprites and game dot power-ups
10:00 - right those are the two groups that I
10:03 - want the powerup sprites to be in then I
10:07 - can just adhere to the init that it
10:12 - should do that now if I do that I can do
10:15 - the same thing with the platform's right
10:20 - soft out-groups equals so this is gonna
10:24 - be a game dot all sprites and game dot
10:27 - platforms this makes it a lot easier if
10:34 - later on as your as you're changing
10:38 - things and you add different groups for
10:41 - different kinds of effects or different
10:44 - different code that you want to add that
10:48 - needs more groups you can easily just
10:50 - add here in the sprite a list of which
10:55 - which groups it needs to be a part of
10:57 - okay so if we do that then over here we
11:02 - no longer need this line oops we no
11:08 - longer need that line we no longer need
11:11 - either of these lines and in fact we
11:15 - don't need when we spawn a platform we
11:18 - don't even need to assign it to a
11:19 - variable because it's going to get added
11:21 - to the group so I can do that there and
11:24 - I can do it here as well okay and now
11:34 - everything should still work the same
11:37 - right we're still spawning and the other
11:42 - group collisions and stuff is still
11:43 - working but we've simplified some of our
11:47 - sprite creation and we're ready to do
11:51 - the powerup spawning
11:55 - okay so let's add a couple more game
11:57 - settings over here we're going to add
12:09 - a couple of things here I'm going to add
12:11 - a boost power that we're gonna use for
12:14 - when we how how fast the boost shoots us
12:20 - upwards and we're also going to add a
12:26 - number for how frequently we want these
12:30 - power-ups to spawn so I'm gonna put
12:35 - about something less than ten right so
12:40 - this is how likely every time a platform
12:43 - spawns that it will have it how like it
12:45 - is to have a tower up on it all right
12:48 - so in the platform in it right here when
12:51 - the platform spawns we're just going to
12:54 - give it a chance to have a powerup on it
12:59 - and all we need to do for that is we
13:02 - could pick a random number between 1 and
13:05 - 100 or 0 to 99 technically and if it's
13:09 - less than the power of spawn percentage
13:11 - then we'll spawn a powerup we pass it a
13:15 - copy of self game and we pass it a copy
13:19 - of the platform itself ok and then we
13:28 - are going to need Rand range up here and
13:32 - let's see how that works up there we go
13:37 - so that one spawned and has a plot a
13:39 - powerup on it so now we can see that
13:45 - most of the platforms aren't having
13:47 - power ups on them but every once in a
13:49 - while we got a dry spell here hope
13:52 - there's another one
13:54 - and again once we start responding
13:58 - different kinds of power-ups we can
14:00 - change that percentage around very
14:02 - easily so all that's left is here in our
14:08 - update to just check for collisions with
14:12 - the platform's I mean with the power-ups
14:14 - so we can stick this in here this is
14:24 - going to be if player
14:27 - it's a powerup okay so much like we've
14:34 - done before we're gonna do a sprite
14:36 - collide between the player and the
14:42 - power-ups and we want the power-ups to
14:46 - disappear
14:50 - we might conceivably hit more than one
14:55 - so if the powerup type is Boost remember
15:01 - we might have other types of power-ups
15:03 - later then we are going to take our
15:07 - players Y velocity and we're gonna just
15:12 - shoot upwards at whatever the boost
15:16 - power was and we're also gonna set our
15:19 - jumping equal to false because we don't
15:25 - want to have the jump cut stop our stop
15:30 - our boost in the middle okay so let's
15:34 - see how that works now I'll go find a
15:38 - boost power up spawn for us
15:45 - there we go OOP OOP self dot player
15:50 - player velocity game doesn't have a
15:53 - velocity oh there's a couple alright
15:56 - there we go so now we're getting some
16:02 - all right we can get pretty high scores
16:07 - now up unless that happens what a bummer
16:11 - anyway you can see the power-ups are
16:13 - working and now we have a chance to
16:18 - boost if we had another one along the
16:20 - way it's gonna boost us again so we can
16:22 - chain them together my maybe we will
16:28 - update or increase that spawn percentage
16:32 - because they're not coming up very often
16:34 - I thought 7% would be plenty but that's
16:42 - good and so that'll about do it except I
16:47 - do want to add one more thing which is
16:49 - it would be nice to have a sound play
16:54 - when we hit the powerup so let's go and
16:57 - add a sound here so I am going to
17:07 - duplicate that line and made it make a
17:09 - boost sound and the sound I have for
17:12 - that I got this one so I'm just going to
17:26 - I'm gonna duplicate this line it would
17:30 - be a boost sound and this was the sound
17:35 - I have is boost 16 another one I just
17:39 - created you can use sound effects there
17:42 - again like we did in the previous one
17:45 - and then we're just gonna want to play
17:46 - this boost sound right here where we
17:49 - just added alright
17:56 - I'll give us some good feedback when we
17:59 - get boosted let's find one first when
18:07 - you're trying to find one to test it out
18:09 - the random number generator doesn't
18:13 - cooperate with you there we go
18:23 - perfect nice okay this video has gone a
18:30 - little bit long I apologize for that
18:33 - it seemed to go by fast as I was doing
18:35 - it but suddenly we were way over ten
18:37 - minutes so we will stop there for this
