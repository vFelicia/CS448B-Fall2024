00:00 - welcome to learning Godot in this series
00:02 - we're gonna walk through making your
00:03 - first Godot engine project you'll learn
00:05 - how the Godot engine editor works how to
00:07 - structure a project and how to build a
00:09 - 2-d game if you've never made a game or
00:12 - even coded before it might seem a little
00:13 - overwhelming
00:14 - but just follow along stick with it and
00:16 - it will all start to make sense the game
00:18 - we're gonna make is called dodge the
00:20 - creeps and it looks like this we press
00:23 - start and your goal is to avoid the
00:26 - enemies as long as you can try not to
00:29 - get hit and if you do you're dead if you
00:33 - haven't already downloaded it you can
00:35 - get the Godot engine from the website
00:36 - here just click on download and download
00:39 - the version for your operating system
00:41 - there's no install process just unzip
00:44 - the file and place the application in
00:46 - your Applications folder or wherever you
00:48 - keep your applications double-click it
00:51 - to launch we're going to start by making
00:53 - a new project and so I'm going to click
00:56 - on new project and I'm going to call
00:58 - this the Dodge tutorial and I'm going to
01:02 - create the folder in my folder where I'm
01:05 - putting on my Godot three projects and I
01:07 - hit create and that's going to create
01:10 - the project and automatically open it
01:14 - alright here we have our empty project
01:16 - now if you go to the tutorial the
01:20 - written tutorial on the Godot website
01:21 - there's a link to downloading the assets
01:24 - the art and sound that we're going to
01:27 - use for this game so you can go there
01:29 - and download this zip file I'll link to
01:32 - that in the notes below and you want to
01:34 - unzip that file in your new project
01:37 - folder that you just made alright so
01:40 - I've unzip that file and now I have two
01:41 - folders in my project file an art folder
01:45 - that has all of the assets we're going
01:49 - to use an a fonts folder that has a font
01:51 - we're going to use for the user
01:53 - interface our first stop is going to be
01:56 - in the project settings where we're
02:00 - gonna set the window size for our game
02:02 - so if we click on project settings
02:04 - there's a whole bunch of settings here
02:06 - and under display window is where you
02:10 - have a width and a height
02:13 - we're gonna set the width to 480 and
02:17 - we're gonna set the height to 720 and
02:21 - close that and we're gonna be ready to
02:23 - start making our scenes in this game
02:26 - we're gonna make three separate scenes
02:28 - one for the player one for the mob and
02:31 - one for the user-interface
02:33 - the heads up display and then those
02:36 - three scenes will be combined to make
02:38 - the game's main scene we're gonna start
02:41 - with our player node so over here in our
02:43 - empty scene we're gonna click + to add a
02:46 - node and the list of nodes is really
02:48 - long so rather than scrolling through
02:50 - and trying to find the one you're
02:52 - looking for the quickest way to find it
02:53 - is to click on search here and start
02:56 - typing in some of the letters that make
02:58 - up the name so for example if I type in
03:01 - a R and then - that's going to find area
03:04 - - D really quickly and area to D is what
03:07 - we want for our player because area to D
03:10 - lets you detect when other objects
03:12 - overlap or run into it and that's what
03:15 - we want for our player we want to detect
03:16 - when the mobs
03:17 - run into it so now I have an area to
03:19 - denote here for my player and I'm gonna
03:22 - double click on that and change its name
03:23 - to player that's what it stands for and
03:26 - then I'm going to click Save so you can
03:28 - either go over here and click Save scene
03:31 - or you can click the shortcut which is
03:34 - control S on Windows or Linux and
03:37 - command S on the Mac so if I hit that
03:41 - it's gonna ask me to save it we can just
03:44 - save this in the main folder of the
03:47 - project we don't need to create a whole
03:49 - bunch of folders we don't have a very
03:50 - complicated game here so we're gonna
03:52 - save this it'll be automatically named
03:54 - player dot scene because that's the name
03:56 - of the root node and we hit save now our
04:00 - character doesn't look like anything so
04:02 - we want to add the art from our art
04:04 - folder over here we've got some images
04:06 - to show our player as it walks around in
04:09 - different directions so we're going to
04:11 - add a child node to the player using an
04:15 - animated sprite this one right here we
04:20 - add that and when you first create an
04:22 - animated sprite it has this little
04:24 - warning symbol next to it which if you
04:25 - click on it
04:27 - you will see tells you a sprite frames
04:29 - resource has to be set in order for an
04:33 - animated sprite to work so that's what
04:35 - we're going to do next here in the
04:38 - inspector we can see the frames object
04:40 - and it's currently null so we need to
04:44 - click the down arrow here to create a
04:46 - new sprite frames resource and when we
04:50 - do that we've created a new empty one so
04:53 - we click on it here to edit it and that
04:55 - will open up this animations panel at
04:57 - the bottom of your editor window where
04:59 - you can create the various animations
05:01 - for your character on the left here is a
05:04 - list of animations we're going to take
05:06 - this default one and rename it to two
05:10 - right and then we're going to click the
05:12 - plus here to make a second one and name
05:16 - it up so we have two pieces of art for
05:20 - right-facing animation and up facing
05:23 - animation now we just need to drag the
05:24 - frames in there so for the right one we
05:27 - want to drag this one in and this one N
05:30 - and on the up one we want to drag this
05:34 - one and this one and now we can see our
05:39 - character has some images there we can
05:42 - click the sprite frames button here to
05:44 - close that panel and then we can drag
05:47 - our window and zoom in a little bit to
05:48 - see our character a little better
05:49 - because now we want to add a collision
05:52 - shape so we know where the collision
05:54 - bounds of this area are so we're going
05:59 - to click on player again and we're going
06:02 - to add another node this time we're
06:04 - going to add a collision shape to D
06:08 - create that and that also has a warning
06:12 - when you first create it because it was
06:13 - what it's telling you is you have to
06:15 - tell it what shape you want this
06:16 - collision shape to be so right here in
06:20 - the inspector we see under shape we can
06:23 - choose from a variety of different
06:25 - shapes but for the shape of our
06:28 - character the capsule shape is probably
06:31 - the best fit so we're gonna pick that
06:33 - and now we need to size this shape so
06:38 - that it fits around our character
06:40 - and what you want to be very careful
06:42 - about is do not grab these outer points
06:47 - on the rectangle that is not going to
06:49 - resize your collision shape it's going
06:52 - to stretch it and that will cause all
06:55 - sorts of collision problems you always
06:58 - want to use the sizing handles that are
07:01 - on the inside of the shape so this one
07:05 - here will change the width this one here
07:09 - will change the height all right so just
07:11 - sort of size it so that it matches
07:13 - pretty well the shape of the character
07:17 - that we have because a little shorter
07:20 - and there we go
07:23 - now something else you want to be
07:25 - careful about is you have this collision
07:26 - shape to D if you're not careful you can
07:29 - accidentally grab it and drag it away
07:32 - from your character and then the
07:35 - collisions are going to happen over here
07:36 - but your character is over here and that
07:37 - gets very confusing and difficult to
07:40 - keep track of you want these child
07:42 - sprites the animated sprite and the
07:44 - collision shape to always be attached to
07:45 - this player node and when it moves you
07:48 - want them to move with it and so to
07:50 - prevent accidentally clicking and
07:52 - dragging them off you can click this
07:54 - button right here next to the lock that
07:55 - says make sure this objects children are
07:58 - not selectable if I click that a little
08:01 - symbol there appears to let me know but
08:03 - now whenever I click here I can only
08:05 - select the player node and that moves
08:09 - all of them together instead of pulling
08:12 - them apart so that completes our players
08:14 - scene now we want to make it move
08:16 - so in the next video we'll talk about
08:18 - how we can add a script to this player
08:20 - and control it to move around the screen
