00:00 - okay welcome back to a game development
00:02 - with PI game this is part 12 of the
00:04 - tile-based top-down shooter game and in
00:07 - this video we're going to get back to
00:10 - writing code and we're going to learn
00:11 - how to load the maps that we've created
00:15 - with tiled into our game in our last
00:19 - video we learned how to use the tiled
00:20 - map editor to make a map for our game
00:24 - and I went ahead and made this little
00:27 - map where I have a little house and laid
00:31 - out all the decorations and things
00:33 - hopefully you were able to play around
00:35 - with it and make some make a map for
00:37 - yourself or if not then you can click on
00:39 - the link below and download this map and
00:42 - use it yourself so we want to load this
00:46 - map into our game and use it as our game
00:50 - map so what we're going to need to do is
00:54 - we're gonna need to install a new Python
00:58 - library so if I open up terminal you
01:01 - should be able to do this whether you're
01:04 - on Mac or PC same way you installed PI
01:06 - game so I'm gonna say pip install PI TM
01:10 - X and that's all it takes
01:14 - now this library called PI TM X is
01:17 - installed and it's a Python library that
01:20 - knows how to read tiled map files okay
01:25 - so if we look at what our map file was
01:29 - that we saved I saved it in our Maps
01:35 - folder called level 1 ok this is what a
01:39 - tiled map file looks like it's not
01:43 - really intended to be human readable but
01:46 - it does have all the information in
01:48 - there about what tile goes where and
01:49 - what they all look like you know where
01:51 - they're located how big the tiles are
01:54 - width and height are 64 that kind of
01:56 - thing has a lot of information in it
01:58 - well PI TM X will read this and
02:02 - understand what it all means and use it
02:04 - to create our map so we don't have to
02:08 - read that so what we're going to do is
02:10 - we're going to go over to our
02:14 - Tom Knapp program right where we wrote a
02:17 - map class that loaded our text mouth
02:20 - file well we're gonna make another one
02:22 - we're gonna make I'm gonna leave that
02:24 - there so that we have it just in case we
02:26 - ever want to go back to our text map
02:28 - okay and I'm gonna make a new class
02:30 - called a tiled map okay
02:33 - and what a tiled map does is it's going
02:35 - to load whatever file name we specify
02:40 - which is going to be a TMX file and the
02:44 - command to load that file is PI T MX dot
02:48 - load underscore PI game the reason they
02:51 - have this load underscore PI game
02:54 - command is that PI TM X is just for
02:57 - reading tiled maps so you may not be
03:00 - using PI game you could still use PI TM
03:03 - x to do things and then there's one
03:06 - option that we need to set called pixel
03:09 - alpha to make sure that we get the
03:11 - transparency that goes with our with our
03:15 - tiles in our table now and then I'm
03:18 - gonna set a couple of properties here
03:20 - that are gonna be useful to know the
03:21 - total width of the map is going to be
03:25 - the width x TM tile with okay this width
03:34 - variable is how many tiles across the
03:37 - map is which we set to 50 and then the
03:40 - tile width is how many pixels wide each
03:41 - tile is which is 64 so 50 times 64
03:45 - that's how big my total map is and the
03:48 - same thing with the height TM height and
03:52 - TM taught tile height and then I'm just
03:58 - gonna store I'm gonna make a variable
03:59 - called TM x data that's just gonna hold
04:02 - all of this stuff so that we can refer
04:03 - to it okay and that's gonna be the init
04:07 - that will load our map and then I'm also
04:12 - gonna make a function called render and
04:15 - that's going to just take a surface and
04:18 - it's going a PI game surface and it's
04:21 - going to draw all the tiles of our map
04:23 - onto it
04:26 - and so if you remember I closed it so if
04:29 - you remember from the level one every
04:34 - layer of the map is named here right we
04:37 - have the ground layer and if I scroll
04:38 - down a bit you'll see the walls layer
04:41 - the items layer all the things that were
04:43 - there in my tiled map and each one is a
04:47 - list of what tiles are where in that map
04:50 - and each tile has its own ID which is
04:53 - some unique number that tiled assigned
04:55 - to each map tile you know each one is
05:00 - given it is given its own unique number
05:02 - well we can go through and read that and
05:05 - the term for that is a GID global
05:09 - identifier and so if we put here self
05:14 - dot TMX data get tile tile image by GID
05:22 - that's the command that you use to get
05:26 - it to find the image that goes with a
05:27 - certain tile right so when we get to
05:29 - here and we want to do tile number 98
05:33 - then there's some image that Maps you
05:36 - know that represents taonaya 98 and we
05:38 - want to get that image that maps tiny
05:39 - tile 98 that's what this is that's what
05:42 - this command does but this is a really
05:44 - long get tiled image by GID is a really
05:50 - long command so I'm just a liasing that
05:52 - command to ti4 tile image that way we
05:56 - don't have to type that whole long
05:58 - command multiple times so we need to go
06:01 - through the layers in our map so for
06:04 - each layer in self dot TMX data visible
06:09 - layers
06:10 - alright so tiled is going to have
06:13 - certain number of layers that are set to
06:15 - visible right because over here on our
06:16 - map that's what these check boxes are if
06:19 - I were to uncheck you know say the
06:22 - ground for example it should be a bad
06:23 - idea but if I did the ground is now set
06:25 - to visible so if I save this my game
06:28 - when it loads this map won't display the
06:31 - ground all right so you can have some
06:34 - layers be set to not visible if you
06:36 - don't want to use them for some
06:38 - particular reason
06:39 - so we're gonna go through each of the
06:40 - visible layers in our map and if that
06:44 - layer is a tile layer tiled the tiled
06:52 - tile layer and what we mean by that is
06:58 - again in tiled you can have multiple
07:00 - kinds of layers right when I click on
07:03 - new layer there's actually three
07:05 - different kinds of layers that you can
07:06 - create we've only worked with the tile
07:09 - layer so far we're going to talk a
07:11 - little layer later about what we can use
07:13 - these other types of layers for but we
07:15 - only care about these tile layers which
07:17 - are these grids where you can put tile
07:20 - images so I want to go through each of
07:23 - the layers in the map and if it's a tile
07:26 - layer then I need to get at the X the Y
07:31 - and the ID of each tile in that layer
07:39 - okay so we get the X the Y and the GID
07:42 - and then we're gonna say the the actual
07:47 - tile is equal to TI all right which is
07:51 - that get tile image by GID
07:53 - command if it's a tile then we're going
08:00 - to draw it on the surface so if your
08:03 - stub lit the tile and then the location
08:07 - we're going to blit it is at x times
08:18 - whatever our tile height is and Y times
08:22 - oops
08:24 - x times tau with sorry Y times
08:32 - - okay so we've lit our tile at whatever
08:37 - location it's supposed to be at okay so
08:40 - that's our that's our loop to go through
08:43 - and here I'll go ahead and put this on
08:47 - the next line just so you can see
08:50 - everything okay
08:51 - so so now I've in this render command
08:57 - I've gone through the tile data and I've
09:01 - found for each layer I've looked at
09:03 - every single tile and drawn it on the
09:05 - screen and we're going through the
09:06 - layers in the order that they're listed
09:08 - in the file so the ground will be first
09:10 - it's going to draw all the ground tiles
09:12 - then it's going to go to the next layer
09:14 - up and draw all the tiles for them which
09:16 - was the walls and so on so that's render
09:20 - and I need one more function in here to
09:25 - make this work okay and this is going to
09:28 - be make map and this this command is
09:34 - what I'm gonna run when I load the file
09:36 - I'm going to load the file and say make
09:37 - map wood and what make map is gonna do
09:39 - is it's gonna create a surface and I'm
09:42 - just going to call it the temp surface
09:43 - right now it's going to create a surface
09:45 - to draw the map onto okay and it's
09:55 - however big the tile map is and then I'm
10:01 - just gonna say self dot render onto that
10:05 - temp surface and then I'm going to
10:08 - return that temp surface
10:13 - so now I have my teller so I have my
10:18 - child map class all set
10:20 - it can load the file and it can make the
10:24 - map by rendering all the tiles in the
10:28 - proper locations onto some surface that
10:31 - it's gonna give back okay so that's our
10:34 - tiled map class so now we can go over to
10:38 - our main here and we're gonna go down
10:42 - here where we load all of our data right
10:44 - and we've made a map folder now so I'm
10:48 - going to duplicate this line and I'm
10:52 - going to call this the I'm going to call
10:54 - this the map folder and that's going to
10:57 - just be named that's the folder named
10:59 - Maps right because that's where we're
11:02 - saving our TMX files and then now self
11:07 - dot map is got not going to be to make a
11:11 - map it's going to be to make a tiled map
11:14 - okay and this tiled map is going to load
11:18 - that TMX file from the map folder it's
11:25 - going to load that TMX file which is
11:27 - called level 1 TM X ok so now I've
11:33 - loaded my map and then I'm going to make
11:38 - a surface for it the map image is just
11:42 - going to be self dot map dot make map
11:48 - alright so I do make map which is what
11:51 - we just got through writing it's going
11:52 - to go through and do this which runs
11:54 - through and does all the rendering and
11:58 - then I'm also going to make sure I have
12:02 - the map wrecked
12:08 - so I'll be able to locate it on the
12:10 - screen for where to draw it so that's
12:13 - all I need now I have a big image file
12:16 - that just shows the entire map that I
12:19 - drew so now we can go down to the draw
12:22 - section of our game and change oh by the
12:26 - way yeah and so we can go down to the
12:29 - map the draw section of our game and
12:31 - here we go I'm going to I'm not going to
12:35 - bother filling the background because we
12:37 - don't need to I'm just going to on the
12:42 - screen blit the map so I'm going to blit
12:45 - the map image and then the location I
12:50 - want to draw it is going to need to be
12:53 - shifted by the camera just the same as
12:55 - the other things that we've done right
12:57 - but here's the thing we have this camera
13:00 - dot apply command and that takes a
13:02 - sprite and moves the sprite or shifts
13:06 - the sprites rectangle to where it needs
13:08 - to be well this map is not a sprite it's
13:11 - a it only has a rectangle so we need to
13:14 - go over to our camera and we need to add
13:18 - another function here and what this
13:22 - function is going to do is instead of
13:25 - taking a sprite I'm gonna call this
13:27 - apply rect
13:28 - instead of taking a sprite it's going to
13:31 - just take it a rectangle and given that
13:33 - rectangle it's going to return that
13:36 - rectangle moved by whatever the camera
13:41 - offset is okay so now we have two
13:45 - options for using our camera we can
13:47 - apply the offset to a sprite or we can
13:50 - apply the offset to a rectangle so now
13:54 - over here I can save self-taught camera
13:56 - apply rect to the map right okay so I
14:05 - apply my offset to the map rect that
14:09 - went that line is a bit wide because I
14:11 - made my font size a little bigger
14:13 - because then people are asking me to
14:15 - make my font size a little bigger so
14:16 - they could see so all we need to do to
14:18 - draw the map is
14:20 - this okay and then we also need to just
14:23 - make sure here in our new this is where
14:27 - we were creating all of the sprites for
14:30 - things so one issue we're gonna have is
14:33 - we need to comment out this loop right
14:36 - because we don't have a map to go
14:40 - through with all of the ones and M's and
14:42 - peas and so forth but that means we
14:43 - don't have the P location so we don't
14:45 - have the spawn point for the player
14:47 - so just temporarily I'm just gonna spawn
14:51 - the player I'm gonna just spawn the
15:00 - player up in the upper right hand corner
15:03 - let's just say five comma five just so
15:06 - that it will spawn the player somewhere
15:07 - because we're gonna we're going to
15:09 - change around the way that works but for
15:10 - right now we'll do that so that we can
15:13 - see if this is working okay so when I
15:18 - run it this is what I see so there's my
15:20 - player there is my map and if I walk
15:23 - around the map will scroll excellent and
15:30 - just like with everything else when I
15:32 - get down to the edge it stops scrolling
15:34 - I do go off the edge because there's no
15:36 - obstacle there so that's something we
15:39 - will add soon but I can run around on my
15:45 - map everywhere and it's all being drawn
15:47 - properly and that's great but what about
15:53 - the walls right obviously I don't have
15:56 - any obstacles anymore so I am free to
16:01 - run around anywhere I want
16:06 - well now that we have the map loading in
16:09 - the next video what we're going to do is
16:11 - we're going to talk about how we use the
16:13 - object layer to indicate on our map
16:16 - where we want obstacles and other things
16:20 - like the player spawn point and things
16:22 - like that in our game to be where we
16:26 - want them to be on the map and so we're
16:28 - going to do that in the next video so
16:30 - this video we will wrap up here
16:33 - hopefully you have your map loading and
16:36 - working again you can download this map
16:39 - from the link below in the description
16:42 - if you want to use this one otherwise
16:45 - feel free to go ahead and draw your own
16:47 - it's all going to work the same no
16:49 - matter how you decide to draw it and I
16:52 - will see you in the next video please go
16:55 - ahead and hit that like button and
16:57 - subscribe and the next video will be
17:00 - along very soon bye
17:10 - you
