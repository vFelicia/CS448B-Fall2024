00:00 - welcome back to part 10 of the circle
00:02 - jump series in this video we're going to
00:04 - fix some things that we discovered last
00:07 - week when we started doing some Android
00:08 - testing and we're also going to add a
00:10 - high score function all right let's get
00:12 - started
00:12 - so first of all I want to thank everyone
00:15 - who tested the apk out on their phones
00:19 - from last video we got a lot of good
00:22 - testing done and so the first thing
00:24 - we're gonna do this time is we are going
00:27 - to switch to the GL ES 2 renderer it's a
00:32 - lot more compatible on more phones and
00:35 - has less less issues with it we had a
00:40 - feeling that that was going to be the
00:41 - case and it turned out to be true but
00:44 - what that means is we're going to have
00:46 - to remove this world environment because
00:50 - the thing we were using it for which was
00:53 - the glow effect doesn't work in GL ES 2
00:56 - and so if we want the circles to glow
01:01 - we're gonna have to do that in a shader
01:04 - the other issue we found was that this
01:07 - animation for showing the message is
01:11 - really performing poorly so whenever you
01:16 - jump from one ring to another and you
01:19 - get up a level and that message pops up
01:22 - it's lagging the game like crazy and it
01:25 - just turns out that animating the labels
01:31 - dynamic font causes too much overhead so
01:36 - this is just not efficient so we are
01:38 - going to nuke that animation or sorry
01:41 - that track at least on the animation so
01:44 - it costs custom font size we're going to
01:46 - nuke that and now instead we're going to
01:48 - animate the scale so we're going to take
01:50 - the scale from 1 well create a key for
01:56 - that and at the end we will go to 2 and
02:01 - we'll key that now the problem the only
02:06 - problem with that is that it's going to
02:07 - grow kind of asymmetrically because it
02:10 - grows from the anchor point and we could
02:13 - would set the pivot offset here manually
02:17 - but since we are going to be having
02:21 - different sized screens and we have
02:22 - everything dynamic we'll set that in
02:24 - code so in the ready for our HUD we're
02:29 - going to set the pivot offsets a message
02:36 - rec pivot offset is going to equal and
02:39 - we want to just set it to the center
02:41 - whatever the center of the rectangle is
02:43 - so we just take the rec size up in size
02:47 - size and divide by 2 and that will put
02:51 - it in the right place where it needs to
02:53 - be when we run and now we should get a
02:59 - good centered go let's go ahead and jump
03:04 - a couple times so we see the level up
03:06 - message there we go so a big thanks to
03:10 - twiddle on YouTube before suggesting
03:13 - that solution which worked out really
03:15 - well so now on to the circle shader that
03:19 - we need to replicate that glow effect
03:23 - and while we're at it add a little bit
03:25 - more flair to it so we're gonna go to
03:28 - the material on the sprite and right now
03:33 - we're using this color shader you know
03:35 - that just lets us set B rings color and
03:40 - I'm going to make this unique because
03:46 - we're gonna make a new shader for the
03:47 - glow that I don't want to use on the
03:50 - jumper sprite so we're gonna need a
03:53 - couple more uniforms here first one is
03:58 - speed because we're gonna animate this
03:59 - and the nice thing about these uniforms
04:04 - is you can add a hint range for what you
04:06 - want the inspector setting to be able to
04:11 - vary between so we put that there effect
04:17 - for is not speeds not effect for our
04:18 - speed is a flip
04:20 - and that will let us over here range
04:24 - this from zero to 20 and we'll also do
04:26 - one called
04:28 - radius so that we can vary this based on
04:32 - the size of the circle for when our
04:38 - circles get smaller and then the last
04:43 - one for getting my types they're writing
04:46 - too much GD script and then the last one
04:48 - here we're going to do is width and is
04:50 - basically going to be the the size of
04:52 - the glow effect and that's going to go
04:56 - from zero to one as well
04:57 - now on to our fragment shader here where
05:00 - we're going to start with everything
05:04 - being centered so we want the center of
05:06 - our texture here which is a UV of 0.5
05:12 - 0.5 our time is going to be multiplied
05:21 - by our speed factor the radius of the
05:26 - effect is going to be it's going to need
05:30 - to be scaled I'm doing 0 0 5 times sine
05:35 - of time and then also the thickness of
05:42 - the effect is width also using cosine
05:49 - time and then the distance from the
05:53 - center load is the distance from the
06:01 - current location relative to the center
06:05 - that's how far away it is so now we
06:08 - still use our color that we're setting
06:11 - over in the shader parameters but now
06:14 - we're going to add on to the Alpha some
06:17 - additional value which is we need a
06:22 - smooth step the thickness divided by two
06:26 - point zero comma zero zero and then we
06:31 - want an the absolute value of
06:35 - disk fineness rad which is how far away
06:37 - and so now what that's going to do is
06:41 - right now nothing changed but if we go
06:43 - over here and set the radius you can see
06:46 - where the glow effect is gonna be so
06:48 - we'll set that to match the size of our
06:51 - circle and then the width is going to be
06:54 - how much the glow spreads out and now
07:00 - the one problem we have now that you'll
07:02 - notice is that we get this effect now
07:05 - the reason for that is because our
07:06 - shader is running on the sprite so it
07:08 - can only affect the pixels of the
07:11 - sprites texture so to solve that I've
07:15 - made a larger texture a larger image
07:19 - with some extra transparent pixels
07:21 - around the circle to give it some more
07:24 - room to draw the glow effect and so that
07:28 - looks like this gives us some more space
07:31 - and then the other one is so for now
07:34 - we're just going to stick to this giving
07:35 - it this glow effect but we also have
07:37 - this speed factor which lets us animate
07:40 - that glow if we want it to pulse and
07:43 - that's something we can possibly mess
07:47 - around with later maybe with certain
07:48 - types of circles haven't quite decided
07:51 - yet
07:53 - but if we leave that at zero we just get
07:55 - a static glow
07:56 - okay I've saved that shader if you want
07:59 - to grab it as circle glow got shader and
08:03 - the other thing we have to do now that
08:05 - the size of our texture changed so some
08:10 - of these are gonna be off I'm not going
08:11 - to go through them all the way but we're
08:13 - gonna start out with our default radius
08:14 - being a little bigger and we're going to
08:17 - adjust the orbit position and the
08:21 - drawing of the pie effect in the center
08:27 - just a little bit so that it matches the
08:30 - new size okay so now we're going to add
08:33 - one more feature so on the game over
08:36 - screen I've added two more labels for
08:40 - the score and the current high score so
08:43 - that when you lose see what your score
08:45 - was and what's current best
08:47 - score is and we're gonna display those
08:50 - there and then we're also going to need
08:52 - to save the high score so that between
08:54 - game sessions that persists so we're
08:58 - going to need to save some data so over
09:01 - in our screens when we call game over
09:03 - we're actually going to pass in the
09:07 - score and the high score and before we
09:13 - change to the game over screen we're
09:15 - going to set those values so the score
09:17 - box is going to be equal to the game
09:19 - over screen that scores container just
09:24 - to make it easier for us to read and
09:27 - type and then we're gonna set the I'm
09:31 - gonna say get node score we're gonna set
09:35 - the text of that to the word score with
09:41 - whatever score value we passed in and
09:45 - then the same thing with the best so now
09:51 - over in Maine when we call game over
09:54 - because the jumper died we need to pass
09:56 - in those variables so let's declare them
09:59 - we have a score and now we also have a
10:05 - high score which will default to zero as
10:10 - well and then when the jumper dies we
10:13 - pass in score and high score but also
10:19 - when the player died that's when we need
10:22 - to check if the score is greater than
10:24 - the high score then we just got a new
10:26 - high score right and we need to save
10:30 - that score which we'll talk about how to
10:32 - do in a second but that means that we
10:35 - also have to load that high score when
10:39 - we start a new session so in ready we're
10:44 - going to need to do that so let's define
10:47 - where we want to save our score and we
10:51 - would put that in the settings not Gd
10:53 - let's just declare
10:56 - the score file and that's going to be in
10:59 - user that's the location where you're
11:02 - supposed to save user data and we'll
11:06 - just call it high score save and so we
11:09 - save that in users now over in back to
11:12 - our main script we can define load in
11:15 - safe score so loading the score just
11:20 - means going and pulling that data out so
11:24 - we get a new file object and if if the
11:29 - file exists then we'll be able to read
11:34 - from it so we'll open it for reading and
11:43 - high score is just going to be get
11:46 - guitar and then we close the file and
11:53 - now saving the file is just the opposite
11:58 - we want to do pretty much the same thing
12:02 - which is we want to get a new file
12:05 - object so we can grab that and now we
12:09 - don't need to test if it exists but we
12:12 - do want to open it but this time we want
12:16 - to open it in write mode and then we're
12:22 - going to use F store var to stick it in
12:30 - there and then close so now if we try it
12:35 - out we'll see that if I died right away
12:40 - alright my score was 1 best is one but
12:44 - if I go and get a couple of points and
12:47 - then die now the best is 3 if I quit
12:52 - that should still be there again the
12:56 - best history could that'll do it for
12:59 - this time I think we're getting really
13:00 - close for making a lot of progress
