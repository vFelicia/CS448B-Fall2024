00:00 - welcome back this is part 7 of the intro
00:04 - to 3d series for Godot in this
00:07 - installment we're gonna learn how to
00:08 - make a first person character we're
00:11 - gonna start with our same CSG scene we
00:13 - built in the last part so that we have
00:16 - somewhere for our character to walk
00:17 - around in and now for a first person
00:20 - character we don't so much need a model
00:25 - for the character because the player is
00:27 - going to be looking out from the
00:28 - character's eyes so really we just need
00:30 - a camera that moves around based on the
00:33 - players input but it also needs to
00:36 - collide with walls and not fall through
00:37 - the floor and all that kind of stuff so
00:39 - we're gonna start with a kinematic body
00:41 - so let's go over here and add a
00:43 - kinematic body this is gonna be our I'm
00:47 - gonna call this an FPS character now
00:51 - we're gonna add two collision shapes to
00:53 - this and I'll explain why in a second
00:56 - but one of them is going to be called
00:58 - the body and one of them is going to be
01:00 - called the feet and then we need to add
01:05 - the camera now the thing is the way that
01:07 - the control scheme is gonna work is you
01:09 - look left and right when you pan the
01:11 - mouse left and right and you look up and
01:13 - down when you pan the mouse up and down
01:15 - but we don't want to rotate the
01:17 - kinematic character up and down when you
01:20 - look up and down because then you'd be
01:22 - falling on your back or falling on your
01:24 - face so we need the camera to rotate up
01:27 - and down independently of the body so
01:31 - we're going to add a spatial here and
01:33 - I'm going to call this the rotation
01:37 - pivot or actually let's just call this
01:41 - the pivot keep the name short and then
01:44 - we're gonna add the camera to that the
01:47 - camera will live in there so that way
01:49 - let's switch to the local mode here that
01:51 - way when the character so the FPS
01:55 - character is going to turn left and
01:57 - right and of course the camera goes with
01:58 - it but the camera pivot will be what
02:04 - rotates up and down so the camera will
02:07 - now be pointing up but the character is
02:09 - still pointing forward okay now
02:13 - now these collision shapes are going to
02:15 - represent our character's body and for
02:19 - that we're going to use a capsule shape
02:21 - which we need to rotate 90 degrees in X
02:25 - so it's pointing up and to give it a
02:29 - size that's appropriate we're gonna
02:31 - change the radius to 0.5 to make it a
02:35 - little narrower and we can leave the
02:37 - height at 1 that gives us about a 2
02:40 - meter high box which is pretty good now
02:45 - a capsule character is nice because if
02:49 - there are small bumps on the ground or
02:51 - things like that you will sort of roll
02:54 - right over them because of the rounded
02:56 - bottom but it also causes a problem when
02:59 - you're when you walk up to ledges or
03:01 - things like that if you stand on a Ledge
03:02 - you will just gravity will sort of slide
03:06 - you off of the edge which is not good so
03:09 - that's why we're gonna have a collision
03:11 - shape for the feet and that's gonna be a
03:13 - box we're gonna set the box size fairly
03:17 - small I'm going to use point four point
03:20 - one and point four and then we're going
03:24 - to move that down and we want that to be
03:26 - down near the bottom of the down near
03:29 - the bottom of the capsule shape but not
03:32 - all the way to the bottom because that
03:34 - way if we have a little bit of the
03:36 - rounded capsule shape sticking out below
03:38 - we'll still get that effect where when
03:41 - we go forward and we hit a small
03:44 - obstacle we kind of walk over it but if
03:48 - we're at the edge of the ledge we won't
03:50 - slide down it because the box will stop
03:52 - us ok so that's how we're gonna set up
03:55 - our collision shape and now the pivot we
03:59 - don't want to be looking out the center
04:00 - of our body so we probably want to move
04:03 - this up a bit I'm thinking probably
04:08 - about probably about there will a jet we
04:13 - can adjust it as we go but you're
04:14 - looking out of almost the top of the
04:17 - character so that's all we need to get
04:19 - started let's go ahead and add a script
04:22 - to make it move around
04:27 - okay we're gonna have a gravity this is
04:30 - gonna be 30 we're gonna have a max speed
04:35 - this is how fast we move and we're gonna
04:39 - have a mouse sensitivity this is how
04:42 - sensitive the mouse is when you move it
04:45 - side to side and it translates into
04:47 - rotating the character now in the case
04:51 - of the mouse when you move the mouse you
04:53 - get a value in pixels and we want to
04:56 - translate that into a value in radians
04:59 - that we can rotate the node by so I'm
05:03 - going to use point zero two and then
05:05 - again this is in radians per pixel and
05:09 - so for each pixel that we move the mouse
05:13 - we will rotate by 0.02 radians which is
05:19 - about a tenth of a degree
05:22 - all right we're also going to have a
05:24 - velocity this is for our movement and
05:29 - that I think should be all we need
05:31 - so now we need to get get our input all
05:35 - right so we want our input to be in the
05:38 - direction that we are facing with the
05:41 - camera so if we've turn to the right and
05:43 - we press forward we want to move that
05:44 - direction but we might already be moving
05:48 - we might already be moving in a certain
05:51 - direction then we turn and want to move
05:54 - in that direction and if we want to have
05:56 - friction or acceleration or have you
05:59 - know be able to have an effect where we
06:00 - have a slippery ground or something like
06:02 - that you can't necessarily change
06:03 - direction instantly so our direction of
06:07 - input might not be the same as our
06:10 - direction of movement so we're not going
06:12 - to change the velocity directly we're
06:14 - going to figure out what direction we're
06:15 - trying to move in so we're gonna call
06:18 - this the input direction and that's a
06:21 - vector and it's going to be based on the
06:24 - direction that the camera is facing so
06:27 - I'm going to grab a reference to the
06:29 - camera so let's make an unready of our
06:33 - camera equals two pivot
06:38 - camera and then that way we can just
06:40 - write camera now the code for this is
06:42 - gonna be the same as we used for the
06:44 - third person character where we check
06:47 - the four inputs and map the input dur to
06:52 - that transform so I'm just gonna paste
06:54 - that here so this is just directly from
07:00 - our third person character I just
07:02 - changed it to use the cameras global
07:04 - transform and we're adding that to the
07:09 - input direction and now you might be
07:12 - holding down more than one of these at
07:13 - once
07:14 - so we probably want to normalize this
07:21 - otherwise we would move faster when we
07:23 - try and go diagonally and I'm gonna
07:25 - return input dur so the result of Maya
07:30 - get input is I have what direction we
07:33 - want to move in okay now for our
07:36 - rotation we're gonna capture one handle
07:39 - input if we get an input event mouse
07:42 - motion and we want to check that the
07:51 - mouse mode equals captured right only
07:56 - when the mouse is captured do we care
07:58 - about this we want to rotate the whole
08:01 - body around Y based on the event
08:06 - relative x times the mouse sensitivity
08:12 - so that will rotate us side-to-side and
08:15 - then we want to rotate the pivot around
08:20 - X based on the event dot relative dot y
08:29 - times the mouse sensitivity now before
08:33 - we test the movement why don't we go
08:34 - ahead and test the rotation so if we go
08:37 - over to our room scene we can add an
08:40 - instance of our FPS character here and
08:44 - let's place them in this room over here
08:48 - so we're not
08:50 - make sure you're not inside the floor so
08:54 - let's test this out and see what the
08:57 - rotation looks like all right so I'm
09:00 - moving the mouse left and right I'm
09:01 - moving the mouse up and down that is all
09:05 - good the sensitivity is pretty good for
09:08 - me if you want to adjust it remember the
09:11 - smaller you make the number the less
09:14 - sensitive it'll be so the more you have
09:15 - to move the mouse to get it to turn okay
09:20 - oh and one problem we're gonna have is
09:22 - let's say I start looking up well I can
09:25 - keep looking up and now my head has
09:27 - completely turned upside down which is a
09:30 - little bit wrong so we need to clamp
09:34 - this up-and-down rotation to a
09:38 - reasonable limit
09:39 - okay so let's clamp the pivots rotation
09:42 - dot X which is what all right that's
09:45 - what we're changing on the pivot let's
09:47 - clamp that to a reasonable amount and
09:54 - I'm gonna use 1.2 that should be pretty
09:59 - good let's try that out and now if I
10:03 - look up now I'm stopping there at the
10:06 - ceiling if I look down I'm stopping at
10:09 - the floor and I can't look down any
10:11 - further so that's good now we can do our
10:17 - movement so in the physics process we
10:19 - want to increase our velocity Y by
10:24 - gravity we want to get the input so I'm
10:31 - gonna call this the desired velocity and
10:34 - that's gonna be get input whatever
10:37 - direction we get from the input times
10:39 - our max speed that's what we want to go
10:42 - and I'm not going to do the friction
10:45 - stuff yet so we'll leave this part out
10:47 - but we need to set our velocity X equal
10:51 - to the desired velocity dot X and our
10:54 - velocity Z to the desired velocity dot Z
10:59 - so that we get moving in the direction
11:01 - we want but we don't ruin the y
11:04 - that's already been set by gravity and
11:06 - now velocity equals move and slide
11:11 - velocity and then we want to say vector
11:16 - three dot up is our ground normal and
11:21 - then I want a true here for the stop on
11:26 - slope parameter because when we walk up
11:28 - our ramp we don't want it to just sort
11:31 - of slide back down the ramp all right
11:35 - let's try that now all right so now here
11:40 - I am
11:40 - walk forward back and left and right and
11:43 - go through there walk up the ramp all
11:48 - right I hit the crates everything looks
11:51 - pretty good
11:52 - I even made the openings for my doors
11:58 - just tall enough for us to fit through
12:00 - which is a happy coincidence I wasn't
12:02 - planning on that in the last video now
12:05 - for jumping we can use the same code we
12:07 - used in our other character we have our
12:09 - jump we have a jump property jump speed
12:16 - which we can set to how fast we want to
12:19 - go upwards let's say 12 and then we're
12:23 - gonna have a jump property which is
12:26 - whether you've pressed jump or not so
12:31 - jump is going to be false most of the
12:34 - time but if we actually want to use just
12:43 - pressed but if we press the jump key
12:49 - we're going to set jump equal to true
12:53 - and then down in our physics process
12:57 - after moving slide we can test if jump
13:01 - and is on floor velocity that Y is equal
13:08 - to the jump speed and that should really
13:11 - all we need to do to get jumping working
13:16 - good enough okay most first-person
13:19 - characters have some sort of object in
13:21 - their hand so I've downloaded from Kenny
13:24 - a shotgun model we're gonna add a mesh
13:30 - instance we want this to be part of the
13:32 - pivot as well because we want it
13:34 - pointing out through the camera and
13:36 - we're gonna use this shotgun mesh now
13:40 - the only issue with this shotgun pitch
13:42 - that you're gonna notice is it is
13:44 - ridiculously small and so we need to
13:48 - scale it up to match the scale of our
13:49 - character so on the mesh we're gonna
13:52 - scale by about 8 times and then we're
14:01 - going to flip it around and why by about
14:06 - 180 degrees and then we want to position
14:10 - it so that it's sticking out through our
14:11 - camera and that can be kind of hard to
14:13 - do and this is where it's easier if you
14:18 - take the view and split it into two
14:20 - viewports and then on the bottom
14:23 - viewport I'm gonna pick the camera and
14:25 - go preview mode so now I'm seeing what
14:27 - the camera sees and then in the top up
14:30 - here I can grab this shotgun and I can
14:35 - position it and see how it's gonna look
14:37 - when it's in the camera so I want it
14:43 - down into the right a little bit like
14:44 - it's sticking out ahead of me that's not
14:47 - too bad let's see how that looks when we
14:49 - run the scene so there's our shotgun
14:57 - pointing ahead of us and that's okay but
15:02 - you might want to come in here and tweak
15:03 - this and maybe rotate it so it's
15:06 - pointing a little bit at an angle so it
15:08 - looks more like it's coming you know
15:10 - from your from your side where your arm
15:14 - is not directly a straight ahead and
15:18 - obviously we don't have any arm or hand
15:21 - models here that we can attach to this
15:24 - yet but all of that we'll have to wait
15:27 - for a later day
15:29 - this will do it for this video hopefully
15:31 - this helped you in getting started and
15:33 - creating your own first person character
