00:00 - welcome back this is part 2 of the Godot
00:02 - top-down tank battle game in part 1 we
00:05 - made the player tank and added some
00:07 - controls to it and in this part we're
00:09 - going to talk about making the terrain
00:11 - that we will drive around on top of in
00:16 - the last video we created the player
00:18 - tank which can drive around using the
00:20 - WASD keys and has a turret that points
00:24 - towards the mouse pointer at all times
00:27 - this time what we're going to talk about
00:29 - is how to make the map the the level
00:32 - that the tank is going to drive around
00:33 - on in your assets folder there is a
00:36 - terrain tile set which looks like this
00:39 - that's made up of a bunch of 128 by 128
00:43 - tiles that are just laid out in a grid
00:46 - like this and we want to use these in a
00:50 - tile map node so that we can draw our
00:53 - level however we want to draw it using
00:55 - these individual tiles now if you know
01:00 - how tile maps work you have to create
01:02 - individual sprites out of each of these
01:04 - squares and you can optionally attach
01:07 - collisions to them which we don't need
01:09 - for the ground but you put those all
01:11 - together and then you convert that into
01:14 - a tile set which is a good resource
01:17 - object and then you use that in your
01:19 - tile map to draw everything now since
01:23 - these are all pretty much identical
01:25 - they're all squares and they're laid out
01:28 - in a regular grid rather than cut them
01:32 - up one by one and make these one by one
01:34 - which is going to be kind of tedious I
01:36 - thought that I would make a script that
01:38 - will just parse this image and convert
01:43 - it into a tile set directly so how do we
01:45 - do that well I'm going to make a new
01:46 - scene and I'm just gonna get a node as
01:50 - its root I'm just going to call this
01:53 - tile set maker and I'm going to save
01:57 - this in a terrain folder
02:02 - now to the scene I'm gonna add a sprite
02:08 - and in the texture I'm going to put the
02:12 - asset image now this I'm doing it this
02:18 - way because this scene I can reuse this
02:21 - in any texture I put in the sprite node
02:23 - he's gonna get sliced up by the script
02:25 - so I suspect later on we'll have some
02:29 - more images that we want to add or some
02:32 - more details we want to add to the map
02:33 - and we might need to use another tile
02:36 - set in here so we can reuse this script
02:39 - so we're gonna add a script to the tile
02:41 - set maker node and what this is gonna do
02:48 - is look at that texture slice it up into
02:52 - 128 528 chunks and stick them into a
02:55 - tile set object and then save that so
03:00 - what we need to do is we need to
03:01 - configure the tile size so that we know
03:04 - what size we need 2 slice this up into
03:08 - so 128 528 is the size of the drawings
03:12 - and the texture that we're going to use
03:17 - is the sprites texture and then we can
03:23 - just do everything in the ready so that
03:25 - when we run the scene it'll do it and
03:27 - we'll be done so first we need to get
03:30 - the size of the image so the texture
03:35 - width is going to be the get width and
03:41 - then we're going to divide by the tile
03:44 - size X so that means if I'm you know 10
03:48 - tiles wide it'll be the texture size of
03:52 - the texture divided by 128 should come
03:54 - out to 10 and then text height is the
03:56 - same get height over a tile size dot Y
04:08 - then we need to make a new tileset image
04:11 - or it's sorry a new tileset object we do
04:15 - that with the new constructor so now I
04:17 - have a new tileset called TS and now I
04:19 - just need to iterate through however
04:22 - many tiles there are so I count two text
04:26 - width and I run Y from zero to text
04:33 - height and then I'll have a loop to go
04:39 - through everything now the region we
04:41 - want to split up that we're sorry we
04:44 - want to slice out of that texture is the
04:46 - rectangle from x times tile size X comma
04:56 - Y times tile size dot Y and then the
05:01 - width is put this over here tile size
05:07 - dot X so I'll size dot Y so then we have
05:15 - our region that we are cutting out of
05:17 - the texture now when we put this into
05:21 - the tile set it needs to be assigned an
05:23 - ID an ID is just a unique number an
05:26 - integer assigned to each tile so we need
05:29 - to come up with a unique ID and I'm just
05:33 - going to do X plus y times 10 and
05:35 - that'll be that'll make sure every tiles
05:38 - ID is unique to its position so then on
05:42 - our tile set we create a tile with that
05:44 - ID and then we say tile set texture of
05:52 - that ID to the texture and then tile set
05:57 - region will use the rectangle okay and
06:06 - so now when this loop is done I will
06:08 - have every tile created so at the end we
06:13 - can use resource saver to save the image
06:17 - and we're going to save it
06:19 - in the terrains sorry terrain folder I'm
06:24 - gonna call it terrain tiles GREs we save
06:30 - that that object so this saves resource
06:34 - saver will save any kind of any resource
06:36 - type object which tileset is and you
06:40 - just give it the location and filename
06:42 - so that's it so now when we open up the
06:45 - terrain folder here so you can see if I
06:47 - run this script when I close it I now
06:52 - have a Chow resource here in my terrains
06:55 - folder so I'll close that we can use
06:58 - that again later if we ever need it to
07:00 - slice up another image and we're gonna
07:03 - make a new folder now to be our level
07:07 - the the map that we're going to start
07:10 - with now eventually we might make more
07:11 - but we're gonna start with just one so
07:13 - I'm gonna use a node 2d for the root and
07:17 - I'm just gonna call this map oh one just
07:23 - since it's gonna be the first one we'll
07:25 - see how it goes I still not a hundred
07:27 - percent finalized on how I'm gonna
07:29 - design these maps so I'm kind of playing
07:32 - it by ear right now I know I'm going to
07:33 - use a tile map node to be the terrain so
07:39 - in that time app node we need to put our
07:41 - resource that we made and there's all
07:43 - our tiles showing up alright soo mout so
07:47 - I'm here we need to change the cell size
07:50 - defaults to 64 and these tiles are 128
07:54 - and now we've got our tile set working
08:00 - and we can you know go out here and draw
08:03 - stuff and everything looks fine
08:06 - so we want to draw some kind of level
08:08 - don't worry about this size right this
08:11 - is the the game window is showing right
08:13 - here so the map can be much larger than
08:16 - the game window because we'll we'll
08:18 - attach a camera to the player so that
08:20 - they can scroll them up as they run
08:22 - around so feel free to draw your map out
08:24 - however you want I'm gonna put some
08:25 - roads some various roads going around
08:27 - different places and I'll skip over the
08:31 - boring drawing part
08:32 - okay so here's a quick map I drew up
08:34 - just made some roads going around got a
08:36 - highway running down in the middle I
08:39 - used a little bit of the sand tiles I'm
08:43 - a little bit of the grass because we
08:44 - have the nice transition tiles between
08:46 - them and you know that's fine for now I
08:49 - named this ground because one of the
08:51 - useful things you can do with time apps
08:53 - is you can layer them and have
08:55 - additional tile maps on top of this one
08:57 - that you know place your trees or rocks
09:00 - or buildings or whatever and we'll
09:03 - probably do that later so I'm going to
09:04 - call this one ground and so now we're
09:06 - gonna save this and we're going to put
09:08 - this in a go up a level and make a
09:12 - folder called Maps I'm gonna save our
09:14 - maps in there and that will give us
09:19 - enough to get started now to our map
09:23 - here we want to add our player so I'm
09:25 - gonna instance from the tanks folder my
09:29 - player in there and there's my player
09:31 - over here in the corner and if I were to
09:34 - run the scene my player would start out
09:36 - here and I can only see a little bit of
09:39 - the map so what we want to do is we want
09:42 - to take our player scene and add a
09:45 - camera to it so I'm going to add a cam
09:48 - 2d set the current to on and then I'm
09:55 - also gonna zoom out a little bit
09:56 - let's try 1.4 see how that goes and then
10:04 - if I run my map I should have there we
10:08 - go there's my tank I can zoom around and
10:12 - see my level now one of the things we
10:16 - want to do is we need to put some limits
10:18 - on this camera because when I reach the
10:21 - edge of the map I wanted to stop
10:23 - scrolling right I actually wanted to
10:25 - stop scrolling when it reached about or
10:28 - exactly there right now if I go down any
10:31 - further then that map won't scroll
10:35 - anymore and the camera limits are set if
10:38 - we go back over to our camera here there
10:41 - the limits are set left top right and
10:44 - bottom these are your
10:46 - maximum and minimum x and y values for
10:50 - the the camera and so if I scroll out to
10:54 - to show you so this this purple
10:56 - rectangle here shows the camera what the
10:59 - camera sees right so if I were to move
11:01 - it around which I don't want to move it
11:02 - around separately if I were to move the
11:05 - player around you would see the camera
11:07 - moved to now let's say I didn't want the
11:10 - camera to go past the zero zero point
11:12 - I'm just going to do this temporarily to
11:14 - show you so if I were on the camera set
11:16 - I wanted the left limit to be zero and I
11:19 - wanted the top limit to be zero then
11:22 - when I move my player around see how
11:25 - that rectangle stops scrolling when it
11:27 - hits those limits and so we want our
11:30 - camera to do that as well but we wanted
11:33 - to do it automatically based on the size
11:35 - of the map you drew depending on how big
11:38 - the map was that's how big we want it to
11:41 - be so I'm gonna make a script for this
11:44 - map I'm gonna name it just map GD
11:48 - instead of map a1 because all our
11:51 - different maps are actually gonna use
11:52 - the same script which is just going to
11:55 - tell them how to populate themselves how
11:58 - to set them out the camera limits etc so
12:01 - here's our script for that now this is
12:05 - going to happen in the ready function
12:08 - we're going to want to say set camera
12:11 - limits and then we're going to define
12:14 - what that what that function does here
12:21 - now I'll zoom in a little bit
12:23 - alright so to set the camera limits we
12:26 - need to find out how much of the map is
12:28 - being used so we can use do that by
12:32 - using the ground get used rect and that
12:37 - gets a rectangle telling you how much
12:39 - space your map is taking up right go
12:43 - back over here that'll be this rectangle
12:46 - right if I were to place another tile
12:48 - like for some reason I place the tile
12:50 - over here now that rectangle would be
12:52 - would extend over to there but I don't
12:55 - want that so that means
12:59 - we now know how big our map total is so
13:05 - we also want to know how big the cells
13:10 - of the map are so that we know how that
13:14 - combines all right so we get the cell
13:18 - size from the ground so now we know now
13:21 - we'll know from here that our map is say
13:24 - 200 tiles wide the cell size is 128 so
13:30 - the full width of the map is 200 times
13:33 - 128 and so that's how we can find out
13:37 - what to set our map limits to so on the
13:39 - player camera we want to set the limit
13:44 - left equal to map limits position x
13:53 - times the map cell size dot X and we
14:00 - just do that again for the other three
14:02 - sides okay and there I've duplicated
14:04 - that three more times and set the four
14:07 - limits so now if we run our script again
14:10 - we should see the camera see the camera
14:15 - does not scroll past the edges of the
14:17 - map no matter how close we get to them
14:21 - and we'll go down to the bottom just to
14:22 - show you that the bottom works - there's
14:27 - the bottom of the map and I can't go any
14:29 - further so setting your camera limits
14:34 - like that is super useful when you want
14:36 - to avoid having those ugly grey voids
14:39 - around the edges of your level as you
14:41 - move around all right I think that's
14:44 - gonna do it for this installment in the
14:46 - next video we will talk about adding
14:49 - some enemy tanks to this level that will
14:52 - drive around and give us something to
14:55 - avoid thanks for watching and I'll see
14:58 - you next time
15:06 - you
