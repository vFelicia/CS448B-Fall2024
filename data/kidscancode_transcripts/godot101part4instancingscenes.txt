00:00 - welcome to part four of good
00:03 - 101 in this video we will be talking
00:06 - about taking a scene that you have
00:07 - created and showing you how to instance
00:11 - it or create multiple instances of it as
00:14 - always if you haven't watched the
00:15 - previous videos please go back and do
00:17 - that before watching this one because we
00:19 - are building on the things we've made
00:21 - before all right let's get
00:24 - started okay here's our bouncing
00:26 - Sprite and it's all working well but now
00:30 - the question is what if we want to make
00:32 - a bunch of these what if I want to spawn
00:34 - multiple of these Sprites and have them
00:37 - all bouncing around the
00:39 - screen well you might think you could go
00:41 - over here and just duplicate this node
00:44 - right so if I right click on this and
00:46 - say
00:47 - duplicate oh now I'm going to get this
00:49 - error and I'll zoom in a bit so you can
00:51 - read
00:52 - it the problem is that a scene is a tree
00:57 - right and there can only be one node
01:00 - that's the root of the tree or the one
01:01 - at the top this this node can have
01:04 - children things that are underneath it
01:06 - that are attached to it but it can't
01:08 - have something at the same level as it
01:11 - and we don't want to make another Sprite
01:14 - that's a child of this Sprite because
01:16 - then they would be joined together right
01:19 - the the child of this Sprite would use
01:21 - its position and all that kind of stuff
01:22 - I want another unique Sprite that is
01:25 - equivalent to this one but I don't want
01:27 - to go and make a bunch more Sprite
01:30 - scenes and and duplicate my code and all
01:32 - that kind of
01:33 - stuff well one of the powerful things
01:36 - about scenes and remember a scene is
01:38 - just a collection of nodes our scene
01:40 - here just has this one node but you
01:43 - could have a scene that could have you
01:45 - know multiple nodes in it and those
01:48 - those nodes together with any scripts
01:50 - that are attached to them can be thought
01:53 - of and actually are an object and if
01:56 - you've done objectoriented programming
01:58 - before you know that that allows you
02:01 - to create multiple of the same object to
02:05 - use that object as a definition for
02:06 - creating more and more objects of the
02:08 - same
02:09 - type and that's what we're going to do
02:10 - with this Sprite scene I'm going to
02:13 - write some code to have gdau just spawn
02:15 - a bunch of these Sprite scenes okay so
02:18 - to do that we're going to start by
02:19 - making another new
02:21 - scene I just click on scene new
02:24 - scene and to this scene I'm going to add
02:27 - a node and I'm just going to add the
02:30 - simplest node possible just a
02:33 - node node that's all I care about I just
02:35 - want this this is just a generic node
02:37 - has almost no properties at all but it's
02:40 - just there to serve as the root of my
02:43 - scene and I'm going to click on the name
02:45 - here and I'm going to call this main
02:47 - this is going to be my main scene so if
02:51 - I save it I'm going to save it with the
02:54 - name
02:55 - Main and then I'm going to hit not the
02:58 - play scene button but I'm going to hit
03:00 - this button this is to play the whole
03:02 - project and when you click on this it's
03:04 - going to say you haven't de defined a
03:07 - main
03:08 - scene which scene is the one that starts
03:11 - when you start the project so I'm going
03:14 - to say I want to do that right now so
03:16 - I'm going to click select and I'm going
03:17 - to select the main
03:19 - scene for that so now when I hit Play
03:23 - and play the project my main scene will
03:25 - open of course there's nothing in here
03:28 - just yet
03:30 - so now let's add a script to this right
03:33 - so we're going to add a script we're
03:35 - going to call it main. GD that's fine
03:40 - okay as usual let's remove our comments
03:44 - and we're ready to start coding okay and
03:47 - in this script we can have just like in
03:49 - our Sprite script we could have things
03:52 - that we can have variables we can have
03:54 - uh things that happen when the scene
03:57 - comes into existence
04:00 - in the ready and we could have the
04:03 - underscore process function do things
04:05 - every frame any of that stuff what we
04:08 - want to do is we want to have we want to
04:11 - have a reference to that Sprite scene
04:15 - let's save this sprite. tscn okay now I
04:18 - could do this I'm going to show you what
04:20 - we're going to do let's call this we'll
04:22 - just call this Sprite we want to load
04:25 - this Sprite scene that's saved this one
04:27 - over here as the file we're going to use
04:30 - the preload
04:31 - function okay and what the preload
04:34 - function does is it lets you name some
04:37 - resource and this is the one we want and
04:41 - so I could rightclick on this and choose
04:43 - copy
04:44 - path and then if I go over here and hit
04:47 - paste this is the path to that Sprite
04:51 - scene
04:52 - file and all the resources that you have
04:55 - in your in your gido project are going
04:57 - to be listed like this starts out with
05:00 - Rees which stands for
05:01 - resource uh and just like a URL on the
05:04 - web colon SL slash and then the path to
05:07 - the object in a more complicated project
05:11 - we might have lots and lots of files so
05:13 - we're going to have we would organize
05:15 - them into folders and you would just
05:18 - right if you had a a scenes folder you
05:22 - know you would put it like that but this
05:24 - will be the
05:26 - the this will load our scene
05:30 - and put it in this
05:32 - variable now the problem too that
05:34 - happens is
05:36 - that what order things happen in is
05:39 - important and you want to make sure that
05:41 - if you do something in the ready
05:43 - function that it is actually that it's
05:46 - actually been loaded and is ready to go
05:49 - and so we're going to put on ready
05:52 - here and what on ready
05:54 - does that's going to ensure that this
05:58 - variable is ready and has been loaded
06:00 - off the dis when we're in the ready
06:03 - function and it's not going to give us
06:05 - an error because it hasn't gotten around
06:06 - to doing it yet so in our ready function
06:10 - we just want to spawn a bunch of these
06:12 - and so to spawn one of these Sprites we
06:15 - would just
06:19 - say instance okay that's going to take
06:22 - this Sprite scene and create an instance
06:25 - of it if I hit play oh we don't see
06:29 - anything why is that well that's because
06:32 - we have created this Sprite instance so
06:35 - we've made one
06:36 - of these but we need to add it
06:40 - to our tree so we're going to say add
06:45 - child and that because we're running
06:48 - this on Main that's going to add it as a
06:49 - child of the main
06:52 - node and when we hit play now we have
06:56 - one
06:58 - Sprite and if you want to look we can go
07:01 - over here to the debugger you can
07:03 - actually see if you look at the remote
07:05 - inspector the remote inspector lets you
07:08 - look at the scenes and the nodes that
07:10 - are currently live that are running
07:12 - right now so if we look under here we
07:15 - have there's our main node and
07:17 - underneath of it is a Sprite if I click
07:19 - on Sprite you can
07:21 - see look at that as the position is
07:24 - changing and the rotation is changing as
07:27 - it runs around
07:30 - screen so now if we want to spawn more
07:33 - of these we can just put this in a loop
07:35 - so if I just say for I in range let's
07:38 - just count to 10 and I'm going to put
07:41 - this in a loop so we're just going to
07:43 - count to 10 and
07:45 - add a bunch of sprite nodes to
07:49 - the scene and there you go it just
07:51 - spawned 10 of them and they're all going
07:54 - to do what they're supposed to do and we
07:57 - can look real quick here just to show
07:59 - show you what happens in the tree now if
08:02 - we look at our tree we can see we've got
08:05 - make this a little bigger we've got
08:08 - 10 Sprite
08:11 - children and gdau went ahead and auton
08:14 - named them because they all have to have
08:16 - unique
08:18 - names but they're all and we can click
08:20 - on them and inspect them and see what
08:22 - they're all
08:24 - doing and what's cool is we can actually
08:27 - do that with
08:30 - quite a lot of
08:32 - them right it'll work totally
08:36 - fine and that's it and as we get further
08:40 - into good development that's how you're
08:42 - going to see we're going to do things
08:44 - like bullets and mobs and things like
08:47 - that where you're just going to set up a
08:49 - scene that describes all the
08:51 - functionality of how any particular
08:54 - object in your game works and then in
08:58 - whatever scene you want them to appear
09:00 - you're just going to instance them as
09:03 - you need
09:04 - them do various things with them
09:06 - whatever you want to
09:08 - do that'll do it for this video in the
09:10 - next one we will start looking at some
09:12 - of the other node types and some of the
09:15 - things you can do with them so I'll see
09:17 - you next time thanks for
09:28 - watching
