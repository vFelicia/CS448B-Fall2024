00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:02 - pygame this is part 14 of the platformer
00:06 - game and we're going to be adding sound
00:09 - and music alright so we're ready to
00:14 - start talking about sounds so we're
00:15 - gonna need to load our sound files so
00:18 - we're gonna stick a section here in our
00:20 - load data method to load some sounds
00:23 - sound and the first thing we need to do
00:28 - is we're gonna define our sound or sound
00:33 - folder and I'm just gonna use s and D as
00:37 - abbreviation for sound because it's
00:39 - shorter to type and this is gonna be
00:42 - just like we did in our for our image
00:47 - folder right we're just gonna join our
00:50 - working directory with the folder called
00:52 - snd which I've created here in our
00:57 - working folder and that's where I'm
00:59 - putting all our sounds now right now the
01:02 - only sound I have in there is one for
01:05 - jumping so our jump sound we're gonna
01:08 - say PG mixer dot sound and we just point
01:13 - to that sound file which happens to be
01:16 - called jump 33 WAV now obviously there's
01:24 - lots of ways you could go about getting
01:26 - sounds you can find them online in all
01:28 - sorts of different places it's also fun
01:31 - to go and use this little tool here
01:33 - called BFX r @b FX arnett this is a
01:38 - great little retro style sound generator
01:43 - you can just click on the thing you want
01:46 - if you want to power up sound it'll
01:48 - generate some writing power up style
01:51 - sounds picking up a coin and there's
01:53 - that a jump category right so you can
01:56 - get jumpy counter stones and that's
01:59 - where I got my sound that I liked using
02:03 - I played around with this for a while
02:04 - target found one I liked you can spend
02:07 - as much time as you like tweaking all
02:09 - these little sliders and and getting the
02:10 - sound just the way you like it and when
02:13 - you have one
02:13 - sure you export WAV that'll save the
02:18 - file as a WAV file we do not want to
02:21 - click save to disk that'll save it in
02:22 - the BFX our format which pygame can't
02:24 - read so don't forget to export and so
02:29 - that's where i got my jump 33 okay so
02:32 - now it's just a case of taking this jump
02:34 - sound and choosing where to play it now
02:37 - we could just go down here to our event
02:41 - and here when we press the spacebar we
02:44 - could just say also play the jump sound
02:47 - so jump sound up play and that would
02:51 - probably work let's see what it sounds
02:52 - like
02:53 - okay now when i press the spacebar and
02:56 - jump i hear the sound that's pretty good
03:00 - but the problem is that's gonna happen
03:02 - every time i press the spacebar so if
03:04 - i'm trying to jump really fast see how
03:07 - i'm hearing the sound even when i'm in
03:10 - midair and i don't want that i only want
03:15 - the sound when i actually jump off the
03:17 - ground so we need to use our players
03:22 - play a jumping flag to tell whether we
03:25 - should play the sound or not so instead
03:27 - of playing this here i'm going to delete
03:30 - that and over in my player sprite i've
03:36 - already got these conditions set up so
03:38 - this is what makes the jumping happen so
03:42 - this makes sense as the place where we
03:44 - should also play the sound and we only
03:46 - want to play the sound if we're actually
03:48 - starting a jump right way meaning we're
03:50 - not already jumping so we could add it
03:52 - right here into this if clause so this
03:55 - is going to be self dot game jump sound
04:02 - play okay and now that shouldn't work a
04:07 - lot better i mean that should work a lot
04:11 - better for my jump sound playing only
04:14 - when i jump so we get the same effect
04:17 - still with that but now if i'm in midair
04:20 - and i press the spacebar i won't hear
04:22 - the jump again right I only hear the
04:24 - jump when I
04:26 - actually leave the ground okay so that's
04:33 - sound and we'll add some other sounds as
04:37 - we go as we had some more features we
04:39 - can add sounds for them but the other
04:41 - thing that I wanted to talk about in
04:43 - this video was music and while that
04:47 - technically is sound to music is a whole
04:50 - nother side of the coin and in music is
04:55 - really useful to add excitement to add
04:58 - interest to make your game more feel
05:00 - more interesting to play to pull the
05:03 - player into the game and so we want to
05:05 - have some background music playing while
05:06 - we're jumping around and just for fun
05:08 - since we're doing it will also do a
05:10 - different music track that we can use
05:13 - during our game over screen or our Start
05:16 - screen so that means we're gonna want to
05:19 - play some music and there are a couple
05:21 - of things you need to know when you're
05:24 - talking about doing music and especially
05:30 - when it comes to pie game there's one of
05:32 - the things you need to keep in mind is
05:34 - if you go over to the PI game
05:36 - documentation it very specifically here
05:40 - says mp3 support is limited on some
05:43 - systems it can crash the program and so
05:48 - you want to stay away from using mp3
05:50 - files for your audio or for your music I
05:56 - should say and so they suggest you use
05:59 - OGG OGG is a great format that
06:03 - compresses really nicely makes your
06:06 - music files nice and small and not take
06:09 - up too much space and there are online
06:13 - converters if you've got an mp3 that you
06:16 - can google for and you drop the mp3 on
06:18 - there and it gives you back the same
06:21 - file in OGG format you probably don't
06:24 - want to use wave just because WAV files
06:26 - are uncompressed so a music file is
06:29 - pretty big it's got a lot of sound in it
06:31 - and so a WAV file of a really large or a
06:35 - long piece of music is going to take up
06:37 - a huge amount of space
06:38 - and the trick is that the way music
06:42 - playback works in PI game is it doesn't
06:44 - open the whole file and load it into
06:46 - memory it streams it so it reads it's
06:50 - continually reading it and playing it as
06:52 - it goes and you can only as you see here
06:55 - play play one music stream at once
06:58 - now you can definitely have lots of
07:00 - different sound effects going on but as
07:02 - far as a music stream that's continually
07:04 - playing you can only have one going
07:05 - going at once so we are going to I've
07:11 - got some music that I already loaded
07:12 - that I actually found on open game art
07:14 - if you go on open game art and you
07:16 - browse the music section there is a huge
07:19 - amount of stuff on there that you can
07:21 - choose from all sorts of things for for
07:25 - horror games RPGs fantasy space techno
07:31 - you name it and so feel free to go go
07:34 - explore in there you can find all sorts
07:36 - of really cool stuff most of the artists
07:40 - will put in there on their page what you
07:45 - need to do to use it how you need to
07:46 - credit them or what they're asking you
07:50 - for in return for giving their music out
07:53 - for free so I have gone ahead and I've
07:57 - grabbed a couple of music tracks off of
08:01 - open game art and I'll link to them
08:03 - specifically in the comments below but
08:07 - let's go ahead and and add them and and
08:11 - so first of all I'm gonna go up here to
08:13 - the top and I'm gonna post the credits
08:18 - so I have one it's called happy tune and
08:20 - one that's called yippee and happy tune
08:23 - is what I'm gonna play for my for while
08:26 - we're playing the game and you fee is
08:28 - gonna be our menu screen music so
08:35 - because we can only play one or the
08:38 - plugin can only play one music stream at
08:40 - a time you can't load both of them ahead
08:42 - of time you can know you need to load it
08:44 - because it doesn't actually load it
08:45 - right it just opens it so you need to
08:47 - open that music file when you're ready
08:50 - to play it or in the part of your code
08:52 - where you're ready to play it so for the
08:56 - music while we're playing the game the
08:59 - new the Deaf new is where the is a
09:01 - perfect place to do this is where we're
09:03 - starting everything up and getting ready
09:04 - to run the game so I'm just gonna add
09:09 - here right before run PG mixer music
09:14 - load and we're gonna say this is also in
09:19 - our sound folder and it's happy tune dog
09:25 - okay so that loads the music so now the
09:28 - music is kind of queued up and ready to
09:29 - play so we want to when we run we're
09:36 - gonna start it so when the run loop
09:39 - starts we're gonna play the music so PG
09:43 - mixer music dot play now if you just do
09:48 - dot play it'll play the music it'll play
09:51 - the music file one time through and then
09:52 - end but there's also a loops option that
09:56 - you can do where you can say how many
09:57 - times you want that music to repeat
09:59 - we're gonna put minus one here which
10:01 - means just infinitely repeat so the
10:04 - music will just keep looping and you'll
10:07 - notice when you search for music on open
10:09 - game art especially a lot of them will
10:10 - be labeled as loops so that that way
10:13 - they can seamlessly just loop around and
10:15 - you don't hear any you don't hear an end
10:17 - of the song and it's starting over again
10:18 - you just get a repeat so that will start
10:22 - it playing when the game starts and then
10:25 - we want it to end when the game ends so
10:27 - when the game loop ends we're gonna say
10:31 - PG mixer dot music now we could say stop
10:35 - but instead I'm going to use fade out
10:38 - which fade out we'll let it instead of
10:41 - just suddenly stopping let it just
10:44 - gradually and gracefully fade out and
10:46 - you just put in here how many
10:47 - milliseconds you want to use to fade it
10:49 - so I'm just going to fade out over half
10:50 - a second which just sounds a little
10:51 - nicer than just cutting it off okay so
10:56 - let's run that and see what happens
11:02 - here we are now we have some nice happy
11:05 - music playing in the background while
11:07 - we're doing our jumping already feels a
11:13 - nice so pretty so and now when we die we
11:19 - should hear the music stop there it goes
11:22 - fades out a little bit and then we're on
11:24 - the GAMEOVER screen and now we can add
11:27 - some music to that so we'll go to our
11:31 - show Start screen and we're just going
11:36 - to do the same thing we did here alright
11:38 - so I'm just gonna actually grab this
11:40 - line and in my Start screen I'm gonna
11:44 - paste that and we're gonna use the
11:47 - yippee
11:49 - OGG file we're gonna play it again with
11:57 - loops equals -1 and then when the Start
12:06 - screen ends we're going to fade it out
12:13 - again alright so there we go now we've
12:20 - got a nice little menu screens now music
12:24 - press play and we start playing now on
12:33 - our game over screen we don't have any
12:35 - music but and we could you could do some
12:39 - you know sad music because your your
12:42 - game ended for now for me I'm just going
12:45 - to do the same music on my game over
12:51 - screen because I don't need I don't need
12:56 - a different song there but you could do
13:01 - that you could do that obviously you
13:02 - could found a different song you like
13:04 - maybe a sad you died kind of so sorry
13:08 - your game is over song add that to your
13:12 - game over screen and have that
13:16 - okay alright so that will do it for this
13:24 - video we've added sound effects or I
13:29 - should say one sound effect we've added
13:31 - a sound effect and we're ready to add
13:32 - more whenever we have some other things
13:34 - we want sounds for and we added some
13:37 - nice background music to our game and to
13:41 - our game over screens so I hope you
13:45 - enjoyed the video if you did please
13:47 - press like that would help a lot and if
13:51 - you're not subscribed please do so you
13:54 - can see the next lesson as soon as it
13:55 - comes out and I will see you next time
