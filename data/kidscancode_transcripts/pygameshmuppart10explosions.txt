00:00 - welcome back to a game development with
00:02 - pygame we're continuing our development
00:06 - in this episode we're going to add
00:09 - explosions to our game which is going to
00:11 - make it a lot more visually appealing so
00:19 - before we get the explosions working
00:21 - there's one other little thing I wanted
00:24 - to add you might have noticed that
00:26 - you've got to keep pounding the spacebar
00:27 - to fire so we're gonna add auto fire
00:32 - meaning our ship as long as we hold the
00:33 - spacebar down the ship will continuously
00:36 - fire so all we need to do to do that is
00:40 - add to our we're gonna add to our player
00:42 - a variable called shoot delay that's
00:45 - gonna just basically be how long it
00:47 - waits in between each time it shoots and
00:51 - that'll be in milliseconds so we'll say
00:53 - 250 and then we just need to keep track
00:56 - of what time we last shot so that we
01:02 - know we'll know whether it's time to
01:05 - shoot again okay and then what we can do
01:10 - is here just like we are checking the
01:15 - key state of the left and right and as
01:16 - long as left is down we move or as long
01:18 - as right is down we move we're just
01:21 - gonna say as long as we are holding down
01:27 - the spacebar then we're also going to go
01:33 - say self - shoot and then in shoot we
01:37 - just have to check that it's been long
01:40 - enough for us to shoot again
01:43 - so now get ticks we'll get what time it
01:48 - is now and if now - the last last time
01:55 - the last time we shot if now - last shot
01:59 - is greater than the shoot delay then
02:04 - we're gonna do this stuff otherwise we
02:06 - don't so what we want to do is say last
02:11 - shot equals now
02:13 - and then I want to indent all of this
02:15 - stuff and in case you weren't aware if
02:18 - you want to indent a chunk of code you
02:20 - can highlight it and then using the
02:23 - command on Apple or the control on
02:27 - Windows the square bracket keys so I'm
02:30 - holding down command and I'm pressing
02:32 - the square bracket keys and you see how
02:33 - I didn't it will you see how it will
02:36 - indent in either direction so I can
02:41 - indent it up to where I want it to be
02:43 - and then the last thing we can do is
02:46 - down here in our events we can get rid
02:49 - of this space bar event because now
02:52 - we're doing it up there in our player
02:58 - sprite so now I should be able to just
03:02 - hold down the key and I'm just shooting
03:05 - steadily I'm not pressing the key I'm
03:07 - just holding it down and there are 250
03:10 - milliseconds apart so I have a steady
03:13 - stream of bullets that'll make it a lot
03:14 - easier and do a lot less abuse to your
03:19 - spacebar now on to the explosions to do
03:25 - the explosions we're going to need some
03:26 - art so I've gone into the Kinney game
03:31 - art pack again in that spaceship pack
03:32 - and I've got some explosions called
03:35 - regular explosion and then see they're
03:37 - numbered 0 through 8 so these are going
03:39 - to be a sequence of images creating an
03:43 - animation so it starts off with this one
03:46 - and then it cycles through and looks
03:48 - like it sort of puffs out and then
03:51 - disappears so what we want to do is
03:53 - anytime a meteor gets destroyed we want
03:57 - to spawn a sprite at that location that
04:00 - starts with this image image number zero
04:02 - and then fairly rapidly just cycles
04:06 - through each of these images until it
04:08 - gets to the last one and then it goes
04:10 - away and we do that quicker it'll look
04:13 - like this explosion puffs out where it
04:17 - is a look a lot nicer than the meteor
04:18 - just plain-old disappearing
04:24 - so first let's load those graphics just
04:27 - like we did with all these other ones so
04:28 - we're gonna load we're gonna need to
04:30 - load a bunch of them and we're gonna
04:31 - keep them in a list and it's actually
04:35 - what I want to do is I want to load
04:37 - these images and I'm gonna resize them
04:39 - just like we did with the spaceship
04:41 - sprite to the right size for the
04:44 - explosion we want but I'm also going to
04:47 - do that a second time and resize it to a
04:49 - smaller image so that we also can make
04:52 - the explosions that will appear when the
04:54 - meteor explodes off of our shield so we
04:58 - also want to show that but I'm gonna
04:59 - make those smaller so they don't cover
05:01 - up our whole ship so we want to go
05:04 - through a list of those filenames load
05:08 - them in scale them to a large size and
05:12 - scale them to a small size and then make
05:15 - two lists the list of the large ones and
05:17 - a list of the small ones so that's going
05:20 - to take a few steps so the way we're
05:22 - going to do that is is we're gonna say
05:25 - the explosion animation is going to be a
05:27 - dictionary and if you are not familiar
05:30 - with dictionaries they're sort of like
05:33 - lists except that each item in the list
05:35 - hat can having basically a name instead
05:39 - of a number for how you refer to it and
05:41 - we'll we'll try this and we'll see if it
05:45 - makes sense if you have any questions
05:47 - about dictionaries you can ask them in
05:49 - the comments and I can point you at some
05:53 - more explanations so in the dictionary
05:57 - there's gonna be an item called large
05:58 - that's gonna be a list and then there's
06:02 - also going to be an item called small
06:05 - that's going to be a list both of those
06:08 - are going to be lists and that's we're
06:09 - gonna we're going to append each image
06:11 - and then we can exhale we want to use
06:13 - explosion animation large or explosion
06:15 - animation small now fortunately those
06:19 - files that we have are numbered 0
06:23 - through 8 so we can do a little loop and
06:26 - just count to get the different file
06:29 - names so we'll do that by
06:35 - counting to from zero to eight and then
06:39 - the file the file name is just going to
06:42 - be regular explosion zero zero something
06:52 - dot PNG okay and the way you one of the
06:57 - ways you can format strings like this is
07:00 - this little easel brackets are a
07:02 - placeholder and they will be filled in
07:04 - with whatever you put over here in the
07:08 - format function so I so first time
07:12 - through the loop I will be 0 so this
07:14 - will be explosion zero zero second time
07:17 - through the loop I will be one so this
07:19 - will be explosion zero one and so on
07:21 - so we're going to get the right file
07:24 - names so then we need to say that we
07:28 - need to load it by game image dot load
07:34 - from our path in the image folder file
07:40 - name and then we need to make sure we do
07:43 - dot convert and then I'm going to set
07:48 - the color key to black like we have on
07:53 - all the other ones and then now I'm
07:55 - going to resize them so the large one is
07:59 - going to be transformed scale scale the
08:07 - image and I want to scale it to 75 by 75
08:09 - now these are just numbers that I've
08:13 - worked out by trying it out and seeing
08:15 - what size I like once you see it working
08:18 - if you like a better you know a
08:20 - different size then you're welcome to
08:22 - change them and now to the animation
08:25 - large we want to append that that image
08:32 - that large image okay then we're also
08:35 - going to take and make an image small
08:37 - which is going to be we're again you see
08:42 - I'm scaling the original I'm not scaling
08:44 - that scaling it 275 and then scaling
08:47 - that one
08:48 - because then the image would start to
08:50 - look kind of fuzzy and blurry so we want
08:51 - to keep doing this do the scale each
08:53 - time on the original image that we
08:55 - brought in okay and I'm making this one
08:57 - 32 by 32 and then we're going to append
09:01 - that to the small list okay then we have
09:10 - all of our images loaded and we'll go
09:14 - ahead and run it make sure we have no
09:16 - typos oops we do have a typo and that is
09:22 - I wrote image 1 an image 2 here I don't
09:24 - know why I wrote that I said image large
09:27 - an image small right typed it and I just
09:31 - said the wrong thing out loud very
09:33 - common mistake to do when you're typing
09:34 - and talking at the same time okay didn't
09:38 - get any error messages so we are good
09:40 - now we've loaded all those images in and
09:43 - we're ready to make our explosion sprite
09:45 - so I'm gonna head up here to my top of
09:50 - my program where I defined my different
09:52 - sprites I had my player my mob and my
09:55 - bullet and now I'm going to after all of
09:58 - those add one more and this is going to
10:01 - be an explosion sprite okay and just
10:08 - like we did on the others we're going to
10:13 - initialize our sprite and we're going to
10:22 - set a couple of things now on the
10:25 - explosion we need a couple of properties
10:28 - to pass in we need to tell it where to
10:31 - where to appear so we're going to tell
10:33 - it the center of the we're going to use
10:36 - the center of the meteor that that we
10:40 - that we're blowing up and say make the
10:42 - explosion spawn right there so it'll
10:44 - appear at the same place and then I'm
10:46 - going to tell it what size explosion I
10:48 - want it to be large or small so it will
10:51 - spawn the right one okay so we'll set
10:54 - the size we'll keep we'll save that size
10:56 - to use whenever we need it and then
11:00 - we're going to
11:01 - create the image okay and the image is
11:04 - going to be the explosion animation
11:09 - we're going to use either the large or
11:14 - the small whichever one we wanted right
11:17 - so explosion animation large or
11:20 - explosion an animation small and then
11:22 - we're going to use number 0 out of that
11:23 - list so the first one in the list is the
11:26 - one we start with and then we're going
11:30 - to get the get the rectangle we're gonna
11:35 - set the rectangles center to the center
11:38 - we said to use and now to do the
11:42 - animation we just need to keep track of
11:44 - what frame were on so we're starting on
11:46 - frame 0 we're just gonna check when the
11:50 - last time we updated it was and then
11:58 - we're gonna set our frame rate which is
12:03 - how long do we wait in between each
12:04 - frame and we're gonna create this as a
12:06 - variable so that we can adjust that if
12:08 - we want to change how the how quickly
12:10 - the explosion happens so I'm gonna put
12:11 - 50 here and then if you want your
12:13 - explosion to take longer to go through
12:15 - you can make that bigger if you want to
12:16 - go even faster you can make it smaller
12:19 - okay so that spawned our explosion I
12:23 - created the sprite and now the update
12:26 - for this sprite is just going to change
12:31 - the image if enough time has gone by
12:35 - this is a very common thing you can see
12:37 - we just did this in the in the auto fire
12:40 - as well is to just find out using the
12:43 - the PI game clock if it's been enough
12:46 - time for us to go again
12:50 - so frame rate so if it's been at least
12:53 - that long then last update will get
13:00 - updated and we will when we're ready to
13:05 - start cycling through so we're going to
13:07 - say frame plus equals 1 so we add 1 to
13:11 - frame
13:13 - if we've gotten to the end so if the
13:18 - frame we've gotten to is the same as the
13:21 - length of the explosion animation
13:30 - whichever one we're using the size that
13:32 - we're using if it's the same length of
13:38 - the size of one we're using then we must
13:40 - have gotten to the end one so if we've
13:42 - gotten to the end one then we should
13:45 - kill it
13:46 - otherwise we need to spawn the new image
13:52 - and like when we started doing the
13:55 - rotation on the meteors we got to update
13:57 - the rectangle so that it stays centered
13:59 - in the same place and it doesn't look
14:01 - like the explosion is shifting as it as
14:04 - it moves which would look weird so we're
14:06 - gonna check we're gonna save where the
14:08 - center is make our new image right which
14:12 - is just going to be the next one in the
14:14 - sequence so explosion animation of
14:19 - whatever size we're using and use
14:22 - whatever frame were on get the new rect
14:25 - and set the Rex center to that Center
14:33 - that we wanted to keep okay so there is
14:37 - our explosion sprite complete now we
14:44 - want to just spawn one of those whenever
14:47 - a mob is hit by a bullet
14:51 - so that is down here in our game loop so
14:59 - right here whenever we spawned a new
15:01 - whenever we want our destroy a mob and
15:04 - take some damage then we want to play
15:07 - the explosion sound and we're going to
15:10 - spawn a new mob so we're gonna say just
15:13 - called expl for short that's an
15:16 - explosion and the two things we need to
15:19 - tell it are where to put the center so
15:22 - that's it whatever the thing we hit at
15:25 - use the center
15:27 - it's wrecked and which one do we want to
15:29 - use we want to use the large ones for
15:31 - the explosions and then I'm going to add
15:34 - that to the all sprites oops
15:37 - da-ad so that we can see it happen and
15:42 - let's see what that looks like
15:50 - oops we got a little typo in our yeah
15:57 - right here
15:59 - where did I type that I misspelled get
16:03 - rekt did any of you catch that as I did
16:06 - it there we go so now you see we have
16:11 - these nice little explosions popping up
16:13 - how exciting
16:19 - okay now let's do the same thing right
16:22 - there when the meteor hits the spaceship
16:25 - so that we can see a little small
16:27 - explosion pop up there so that's gonna
16:30 - be right here where we check to see if a
16:32 - mob hit the player we're gonna do the
16:35 - same thing so I'm going to just copy
16:37 - this and I'm going to place it here so
16:40 - we take away some some shield and we're
16:43 - gonna spawn a small explosion alright
16:49 - and now let's let a meteor hit us and
16:52 - boom we get some little sea faces on the
16:55 - side we get some nice little explosions
16:59 - on us as well alright this has been kind
17:05 - of a long video so we'll end it there if
17:08 - you want to play around with things and
17:11 - adjust them you can change right here
17:14 - how big you make the explosions just
17:17 - make sure you keep the width and height
17:18 - the same because these are square images
17:20 - so you want to keep them square whatever
17:23 - size you make them so they look
17:24 - stretched out and the other thing you
17:27 - could change is in the class explosion
17:31 - you can change the frame right here for
17:33 - how long you wait in between each frame
17:36 - of the explosion and you can see if we
17:38 - were to make that twice as long
17:40 - the explosions will be a lot slower I
17:43 - don't really like that I think it's a
17:44 - little slow but you get the idea alright
17:49 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
17:51 - next time
17:59 - you
