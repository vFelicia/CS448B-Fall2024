00:00 - welcome to part 11 of circle jump I've
00:03 - gotten a lot of questions about
00:04 - monetization and mobile games especially
00:07 - when it comes to free games like circle
00:10 - gems gonna be so you basically have two
00:12 - options and that purchases or ads since
00:16 - this is gonna be an ultra casual game
00:18 - there's not really a place for in-app
00:20 - purchases we don't have currency or
00:21 - anything like that
00:22 - so we're gonna look at how to implement
00:24 - ads in your game and I want to stress
00:26 - this if you want them I know ads can be
00:29 - unpopular but this is a decision for you
00:33 - as the game developer to make when it
00:34 - comes to your individual game we'll also
00:38 - look at how to disable ads if you need
00:40 - to do that alright let's get started so
00:42 - the first thing you're going to need to
00:44 - do is go over to Google AdMob and create
00:46 - an account so just click sign up and set
00:48 - up your account and when you're signed
00:50 - in you can make an app which I made an
00:52 - app for circle jump and in this app
00:57 - you're going to make two ad units a
01:00 - banner ad and an interstitial ad so make
01:04 - one of each of these when you click
01:05 - select you can just choose the format
01:08 - give it a name just call it banner and
01:10 - it's gonna set up a ad ID for each of
01:14 - those that's what we'll be using in our
01:17 - code to tell our program which ad to
01:20 - show now Godot doesn't have any ad
01:23 - functionality built in so there's no way
01:25 - for it to talk to the AdMob API to
01:27 - display the ads so we're going to need
01:29 - to use a plug-in and the plugin we're
01:31 - going to use is this one which I'll put
01:34 - a link for below and it contains the
01:38 - code we need and if you go down and look
01:40 - at the documentation you can see the API
01:43 - reference there are some new methods
01:45 - we'll get that will let us show and hide
01:47 - banners and so on now to use a module
01:49 - like this you're going to need a custom
01:51 - Android template the one you when you
01:54 - downloaded when you downloaded the
01:56 - export templates from the editor do not
02:00 - include this module so it won't work and
02:02 - if you want to compile your own custom
02:07 - export templates the instructions are
02:09 - here in the documentation
02:11 - it does require setting up a bill
02:14 - system in downloading some Android SDKs
02:17 - and Java and so on so it's not
02:20 - necessarily for the faint of heart
02:21 - but it is something good to know
02:23 - especially later when we get close to
02:25 - release where we can disable certain
02:29 - parts of Godot so that we can optimize
02:30 - the size of our apk but for now there is
02:36 - another github repo here which I'll also
02:40 - link below which has some precompiled
02:43 - templates including this plug-in so you
02:45 - just go here to this repo which I'll
02:49 - link below and you click on the releases
02:52 - tab and you'll see here's some Android
02:56 - templates compiled for Godot 3 one one
02:59 - which is what you should be using and
03:00 - that's the thing if you're using a
03:02 - different version you've got to have
03:04 - Android templates that match the same
03:06 - version so if you're using a custom
03:10 - compiled version of Godot you're going
03:12 - to have to custom compile your Android
03:13 - templates so I'm going to download this
03:15 - zip file and we'll be good to go it's
03:19 - back over in Godot now we need to
03:21 - configure things to use this now the
03:25 - first thing we're going to do is we're
03:26 - going to go into our project settings in
03:30 - the Android section and in the Android
03:32 - section is where you are going to
03:34 - specify any custom Android modules that
03:37 - you're using that you want the engine to
03:39 - load when the app starts and back over
03:43 - on the documentation for this module you
03:50 - can see if you scroll down here this is
03:53 - the module name so if you copy that the
03:57 - directions tell you to edit the engine
03:59 - config which or project Godot but you
04:02 - got to close the project and open it
04:03 - again so instead you can just paste that
04:05 - right into the modules list here and
04:09 - then you would put a comma and separate
04:11 - other ones if you have more than one
04:12 - module to load so that's that and now
04:16 - over in our export settings for Android
04:19 - we want to tell it to use those
04:23 - templates that we downloaded and not the
04:26 - default ones so
04:27 - you can set that right here and there
04:29 - two of them the debug and the release so
04:31 - if I click the folder here I can go to
04:33 - my downloads folder which is where I
04:37 - downloaded this and an open that zip and
04:40 - in there you can see there's a debug and
04:42 - a release apk so select both of those
04:45 - and you're ready to go there so now our
04:48 - game when it starts on Android will load
04:51 - that module and what it does is it loads
04:55 - that module as a singleton and we can
04:58 - access that singleton to show and hide
05:00 - ads and retrieve information and so on
05:02 - so we're gonna go to our singleton that
05:06 - we made the settings singleton and we're
05:09 - going to add our add code here and the
05:13 - first thing we want to do is initialize
05:16 - the module so we're gonna start with a
05:20 - variable to hold the reference to the
05:25 - AdMob module we're going to add a
05:29 - boolean called real ads this is whether
05:31 - we want to show test ads or real ads and
05:33 - while you're testing you want to keep
05:36 - this false and once you're ready to
05:38 - release and actually put it up on the
05:39 - app store you can change this to true
05:40 - and then banner top is a value to set
05:48 - when the when the banner up here do we
05:50 - want appear at the top of the screen at
05:51 - the bottom so I'm gonna put false for
05:53 - that and then we have two variables here
05:56 - for our ad our ad banner ID which is a
06:01 - string equal there and our ad
06:06 - interstitial ID these are two strings
06:11 - that you're gonna get from your AdMob
06:13 - configuration and then one more I'm
06:17 - going to add an enable ads flag so that
06:20 - we can turn that on and off so you can
06:25 - go over to your AdMob account and copy
06:29 - hit the copy button and paste your ad
06:32 - unit IDs in here I'm not going to do
06:34 - that in here because that's something
06:36 - that you should keep private so if
06:38 - you're saving your source code on
06:40 - github in a private repo you shouldn't
06:43 - put your ad banner IDs in here so I'm
06:45 - gonna put some temporary ones right now
06:47 - just for this purpose is recording this
06:50 - demo and then I'm gonna delete them so
06:52 - the pastry is in there and then we're
06:56 - going to make a ready function here so
07:01 - that when the singleton loads it can do
07:03 - something and the first thing it needs
07:05 - to do is make sure that that module is
07:08 - there because the modules not present we
07:10 - want to ignore it so we want to check if
07:13 - the engine has the singleton which is
07:18 - named AdMob and if it does then we can
07:22 - load it into our variable reference so
07:27 - engine get get singleton AdMob I
07:35 - misspelled AdMob up there good start so
07:39 - now we have a reference to it right we
07:44 - can call AdMob in it and we're gonna in
07:47 - initialize it with our real ads boolean
07:51 - and we'll also pass the instance ID of
07:56 - our currently running game then we're
08:01 - going to call AdMob dot load banner okay
08:09 - sorry in in AdMob code they're using
08:12 - camelcase so load banner and we'll use
08:15 - our ad banner ID and we will use our
08:20 - boolean whether we want the banner be at
08:22 - the top at the bottom and then we'll
08:25 - also call AdMob load interstitial to
08:30 - load the interstitial ID as well so
08:35 - that'll load both of them so now we need
08:37 - a way to show and hide the banner so
08:41 - we're going to define a show ad banner
08:45 - method which is going to if the AdMob
08:51 - singleton is present
08:53 - and enable ads is on then we're going to
08:57 - call AdMob dot show banner and hide the
09:04 - banner to do that we want to say if
09:10 - AdMob AdMob hide banner and then for the
09:19 - interstitial we need a so ad
09:22 - interstitial that we can call and that's
09:28 - gonna say if AdMob is present and enable
09:32 - ads then we're going to say AdMob dot
09:36 - show interstitial and then we need a way
09:40 - to know when the interstitial ad is
09:42 - closed so if we define a callback for
09:45 - that it's on enter additional closed
09:51 - then we can say if AdMob and enable ads
09:59 - ad MA I'm sorry will call a show ad
10:02 - banner so we can put the banner back up
10:06 - after they get the interstitial at the
10:08 - end of the game now in our main GD we
10:11 - just need to tell it where we want to
10:13 - show these ads so for example when we
10:16 - start a new game we're gonna want to
10:19 - call settings dot hide ad banner and
10:24 - then when we die we want to show on
10:27 - jumper died we want to show the
10:29 - interstitial so settings show ad
10:33 - interstitial and that should be all we
10:36 - need to do is let's give it a try
10:43 - so here I'm streaming my phone screen to
10:46 - my desktop here and you can see the ad
10:48 - is showing up at the bottom of the
10:50 - screen when we play it goes away and
10:53 - when we die we get an interstitial ad
10:57 - which when we close it we're back to the
11:00 - menu and the banner ad is there again so
11:03 - the other thing I want to be able to do
11:04 - is I want to be able to enable and
11:06 - disable ads in the app just like you can
11:09 - in a enable and disable sound so I'm
11:12 - gonna make this variable here for the
11:15 - enable ads I'm going to make this into a
11:18 - set kit and then that way we can control
11:26 - what happens when you turn it on and off
11:33 - and so what we want to happen when you
11:37 - set this is we'll set the the variable
11:40 - and then if enable if you set it to true
11:47 - then I want to show ad banner right you
11:51 - might have your in the menu screen it's
11:53 - disabled right now and if you set it to
11:56 - false then it was probably a minute was
12:00 - on right so if you set it to false we're
12:02 - going to hide ad banner and then if
12:09 - you've changed it to false then
12:10 - interstitial won't clot show and
12:12 - everything like that so we just need a
12:14 - button now in our settings to turn that
12:17 - on and off so let's open up our settings
12:22 - screen all right I want to put that
12:26 - button here but I only have two rows of
12:28 - buttons so let's open up our base screen
12:31 - and I'm just gonna duplicate duplicate
12:37 - this and put another button row in the
12:39 - middle right name of it doesn't matter
12:41 - it's on my settings screen then let's
12:45 - save that now am I saying screen I've
12:48 - got a second row here and I'm going to
12:51 - add a regular old button
12:55 - and then do some quick configuring here
13:06 - you
13:08 - okay so I just made a button here with
13:12 - the text disable ads and I set all of
13:15 - its custom styles to style box empty I
13:18 - don't care about any of the button
13:21 - styling and then I also added a custom
13:24 - font to it size of 48 so I could have
13:27 - the words there and then so when I click
13:29 - that ads will go away and the button
13:31 - text will change to enable ads so that
13:35 - means we need to register this button in
13:37 - our screens scene where we register all
13:43 - of our buttons and we process which ever
13:46 - one is clicked so now we can match based
13:50 - on the button name I don't think I gave
13:52 - it a button name so let's give that
13:53 - button a name we'll call that adds back
13:57 - here so if we press the adds button what
14:02 - should happen
14:03 - well settings enable ads should toggle
14:09 - and then if we set it to true then we
14:18 - want the button text to change to
14:24 - disable ads otherwise we want the button
14:28 - text to change to enable X so just a
14:37 - quick test of that if I click it changes
14:44 - changes okay and a quick test on the
14:48 - phone there's my screen there's my ad on
14:53 - the screen but go into my settings and I
14:56 - disable ads it disappears so I should be
15:00 - able to play lose and not see an
15:04 - interstitial if I go back over here and
15:08 - enable ads they come back
15:15 - so that gives you a way to enable and
15:19 - disable ads whenever you want and I'm
15:22 - gonna leave that on there because the
15:24 - goal of this game is learning and not
15:27 - actual revenue generation so I'll allow
15:29 - people to just turn off the ads when
15:31 - they download this app this tutorial is
