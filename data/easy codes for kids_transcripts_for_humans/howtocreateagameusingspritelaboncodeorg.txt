00:00 - so I love creating games in code.org
00:04 - let's go ahead and create a really
00:06 - colorful game where these little yellow
00:09 - Hedgehog is trying to catch the purple
00:13 - bunny and score a point now every time
00:16 - the yellow Hedgehog touches one of the
00:20 - gray mice that we've also created he
00:23 - goes back to the starting position in
00:25 - the bottom left
00:28 - so the little gray mice do not make the
00:31 - game easy they bounce the yellow
00:34 - Hedgehog back to starting position
00:36 - meanwhile the yellow Hedgehog tries to
00:40 - the purple bunny and if he does then the
00:42 - purple bunny goes into a random position
00:45 - on the screen and makes the game a
00:47 - little bit
00:48 - all right so the first thing we're going
00:49 - to do is go to code.org you do not need
00:52 - to log in
00:53 - and at the top right hand of your screen
00:55 - go ahead and click create and then click
00:58 - Sprite lab
01:03 - the left area of the screen
01:06 - is our
01:09 - spot that we see in real time the game
01:12 - that we are creating
01:14 - the middle of the screen the center is
01:18 - our toolbox of blocks
01:21 - and the right hand is where we drag our
01:24 - blocks of code
01:26 - to make our game
01:30 - the first thing that we're gonna do is
01:32 - go into our blocks in sort of the center
01:36 - of the screen click on our world
01:39 - and let's go ahead and select a colorful
01:43 - background so let's drag out that set
01:46 - background to
01:48 - and then go ahead and click on the blue
01:54 - sky with a rainbow background that's
01:57 - just sort of like a fun background that
01:59 - we're going to use now we're going to go
02:01 - ahead and make three different Sprites
02:05 - first hour
02:07 - gray Mouse
02:09 - and when we click on the location of the
02:12 - gray Mouse go ahead and click on the
02:16 - little yellow location Tab and then drag
02:19 - your mouse to the top right hand of your
02:22 - screen
02:27 - now we go back to Sprites go ahead and
02:30 - drag out make new Sprite
02:33 - and let's select the purple bunny this
02:36 - time and he is good to just sit right in
02:38 - the middle of our screen
02:40 - finally let's go ahead and drag out make
02:43 - new Sprite and let's choose our yellow
02:46 - Hedgehog
02:48 - it's sort of like down towards the
02:50 - bottom
02:51 - and let's drag him
02:54 - so grab those coordinates and drag him
02:56 - to the bottom left of the screen
03:00 - of the screen the next thing we want to
03:01 - do is make a loop spawn five mice
03:06 - so those mice are going to be born in
03:09 - the top right hand of the screen and
03:11 - then go all over the place
03:13 - to try and
03:15 - make our game a little bit more
03:17 - difficult so the yellow Hedgehog doesn't
03:19 - just have a clear trajectory to the
03:22 - purple buddy
03:32 - so let's go ahead and select loops
03:38 - and we'll grab our repeat
03:43 - and we'll put our repeat
03:49 - right underneath our set background
03:52 - and then this code is for our gray Mouse
03:57 - so I'll just drag those other two Sprite
04:01 - blocks down
04:04 - and now
04:05 - instead of repeat 10 times let's go
04:09 - ahead and repeat five times and that
04:11 - just simply means hey let's make a
04:14 - Sprite five times
04:28 - okay the next thing that we want to do
04:30 - is go to our behaviors
04:35 - and drag out
04:38 - Sprite begins
04:43 - and let's go ahead and set up that
04:45 - purple bunny select the gray Mouse
04:52 - and then
04:54 - let's go ahead and select what Behavior
04:57 - we need when these five mice are born we
05:01 - want them to go all over the place so
05:03 - let's drag out wandering
05:08 - so what we've done is
05:11 - let's make five mice and one day and
05:14 - that's just gonna Loop and then when
05:17 - they are born let's have them wander all
05:20 - over the screen
05:22 - okay now let's go ahead and I want to
05:24 - reorder this a little bit
05:27 - so I selected my purple bunny Sprite and
05:30 - I'm gonna put him right underneath and I
05:32 - rolled
05:34 - block
05:35 - and then I have now I have all my blocks
05:38 - for my green ice and now I just want to
05:41 - go ahead and put my block back for my
05:44 - hedgehog
05:46 - that just makes more sense to me
05:50 - okay let's go ahead and press run
05:53 - and we see our mice being sort of born
05:56 - at the top right hand of the screen
05:58 - there's five of them and they bounce all
06:01 - over the place
06:10 - next let's go to Sprites
06:18 - and set size
06:23 - and we'll set the Hedgehog size to 50 of
06:27 - what it is now and let's go ahead and
06:29 - run our game again
06:31 - so it's going to be a little bit harder
06:33 - a little bit more challenging because
06:35 - the Hedgehog isn't as big
06:40 - now let's go ahead and give the Hedgehog
06:42 - the ability to move up down left and
06:45 - right
06:54 - so let's go to events
06:58 - when up is pressed
07:04 - go to Sprites
07:07 - select move
07:11 - and it's moved North 10 pixels is fine
07:17 - and instead of the purple bunny let's
07:19 - select the yellow Hedgehog now let's
07:21 - give it a whirl
07:22 - okay so I press run and then press my up
07:26 - arrow and there goes my little hedgehog
07:28 - up
07:30 - you can only go in One Direction right
07:32 - now so let's go ahead and do
07:35 - South left and right
07:37 - so let's go to events one up is pressed
07:41 - and instead of up let's do down
07:46 - and let's go ahead and go Google
07:52 - move
07:58 - and instead of 10 pixels to the north
08:01 - let's pick South
08:03 - and we run it
08:08 - and there he can go up
08:10 - and then when I press down oops I forgot
08:13 - to move my to change this to the yellow
08:16 - Hedgehog so let's change that to the
08:17 - yellow Hedgehog
08:20 - start again
08:25 - so now my yellow Hedgehog can move up
08:29 - and down up and down North and South
08:33 - with the up arrows and down arrows
08:45 - now let's go ahead and click events
08:48 - when
08:51 - left
08:53 - is pressed
09:00 - go to Sprites
09:03 - move 10 pixels to the
09:09 - West
09:12 - and we can remember our directions by
09:15 - the little saying never eat soggy
09:17 - waffles
09:18 - never North eat is Right South is down
09:26 - and left is West never eat soggy waffles
09:30 - I'm sure you guys have heard I've heard
09:32 - that okay so events one more when
09:35 - right
09:38 - is pressed
09:40 - then we're gonna go east never eat soggy
09:43 - waffles
09:45 - okay so my hedgehog should move
09:48 - up down
09:50 - right and left now
09:53 - when
09:55 - my hedgehog
10:01 - touches the purple bunny
10:06 - or I'm sorry when my hedgehog touches
10:07 - the mice we want him to go back to his
10:10 - original position that we placed him at
10:17 - Okay so
10:19 - we just told the Hedgehog to jump to a
10:22 - random location
10:24 - when it touches a gray Mouse
10:35 - let's go ahead
10:45 - and
10:46 - say instead of the Hedgehog jumping to a
10:51 - random location
10:52 - let's drag out a little location block
10:56 - so we don't need that whole big block
11:01 - and when the Hedgehog touches the gray
11:05 - mouse let's just put it back to the
11:07 - bottom left of the screen I have 85 by
11:10 - 73.
11:12 - you can just put it wherever you want to
11:14 - the bottom of the screen okay let's test
11:15 - it out
11:18 - and it is working so he is trying to I'm
11:23 - trying to get to the purple bunny
11:25 - and the gray mice are not letting me
11:29 - so it just
11:31 - um
11:33 - it just makes the game a little bit more
11:35 - challenging and a little bit more fun
11:37 - okay
11:38 - so now let's go ahead and
11:43 - select
11:53 - when the Hedgehog
11:57 - gets to the purple bunny
12:00 - what happens
12:07 - let's make the Hedgehog or let's make
12:09 - the purple bunny
12:11 - jump to a random location
12:16 - so he is going to be moving all over the
12:18 - place after I touch him I successfully
12:21 - the Hedgehog successfully touches the
12:23 - purple bunny he's gonna jump all over
12:25 - the place he's going to go to a random
12:27 - position Now Let's Make a Score variable
12:29 - so I go to variables set I to
12:34 - and we're going to change that I
12:36 - it's not going to be I let's rename
12:41 - this variable to score
12:45 - and hit create
12:51 - set score to
12:53 - and it's going to be plus 1 every time
12:56 - my hedgehog touches the purple bunny
13:00 - so let's go to math and let's grab this
13:03 - block right at the top here
13:05 - 0 2 plus and then we're going to add
13:10 - that little middle zero out
13:16 - and grab our score variable so set score
13:19 - to plus and then make this one
13:24 - so when the Hedgehog touches the purple
13:26 - bunny he'll jump to a random location
13:28 - and we'll score will go up by one
13:33 - now let's go to text
13:36 - and let's add to the screen a title
13:41 - that says score
13:44 - colon
13:49 - so grab text
13:55 - and let's take out
13:58 - the title and we'll grab our join
14:05 - and in our join in the little quotation
14:09 - marks there go ahead and type score
14:12 - colon I'll put the colon in in a minute
14:15 - let's take out that zero
14:20 - so
14:21 - the title screen will say score and
14:24 - let's go ahead and run it and see what
14:26 - we have
14:31 - okay so I'm going to go ahead and
14:33 - attempt to touch
14:36 - okay there's my score
14:39 - and I actually want to move that score
14:42 - so it is always there not just when I
14:45 - touch the purple bunny
14:47 - and I need that score system to start
14:50 - working
14:51 - but I haven't set the initial score
14:55 - the starting score to zero so let's go
14:58 - to variables set score two and let's put
15:01 - this right at the beginning of my blocks
15:06 - so let's set score two right underneath
15:09 - the background
15:16 - because I want this to be right at the
15:19 - beginning of my blocks
15:24 - let's go to map let's grab this little
15:26 - zero
15:30 - set score to zero
15:33 - and hit reset and run
15:42 - so let me try to make my way up to their
15:44 - purple bunny this is a little bit more
15:47 - challenging than I thought it would be
15:48 - but good kids don't like games that
15:50 - aren't
15:53 - I go up
15:57 - and I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
16:00 - come on come on Hedgehog
16:03 - yay score to one
16:05 - now I need to add that colon so it's
16:09 - score you know dashes one
16:14 - so let's go ahead and stop
16:16 - I'll go down to to title screen
16:20 - where my join is
16:22 - and add a colon there
16:24 - and then
16:27 - and now let's go ahead and instead of
16:30 - when down is pressed let's choose all of
16:33 - those to be wow and run it
16:38 - do you see how much smoother my Hedgehog
16:40 - Moves
16:43 - so instead of when you're pressing down
16:46 - up left and right go ahead and change
16:48 - that to wow
16:58 - and let's add that little colon to the
17:00 - score
17:04 - and let's go ahead and play it and there
17:06 - is our game super easy super fun
17:09 - thank you so much
17:17 - oh honey
17:21 - come along

Cleaned transcript:

so I love creating games in code.org let's go ahead and create a really colorful game where these little yellow Hedgehog is trying to catch the purple bunny and score a point now every time the yellow Hedgehog touches one of the gray mice that we've also created he goes back to the starting position in the bottom left so the little gray mice do not make the game easy they bounce the yellow Hedgehog back to starting position meanwhile the yellow Hedgehog tries to the purple bunny and if he does then the purple bunny goes into a random position on the screen and makes the game a little bit all right so the first thing we're going to do is go to code.org you do not need to log in and at the top right hand of your screen go ahead and click create and then click Sprite lab the left area of the screen is our spot that we see in real time the game that we are creating the middle of the screen the center is our toolbox of blocks and the right hand is where we drag our blocks of code to make our game the first thing that we're gonna do is go into our blocks in sort of the center of the screen click on our world and let's go ahead and select a colorful background so let's drag out that set background to and then go ahead and click on the blue sky with a rainbow background that's just sort of like a fun background that we're going to use now we're going to go ahead and make three different Sprites first hour gray Mouse and when we click on the location of the gray Mouse go ahead and click on the little yellow location Tab and then drag your mouse to the top right hand of your screen now we go back to Sprites go ahead and drag out make new Sprite and let's select the purple bunny this time and he is good to just sit right in the middle of our screen finally let's go ahead and drag out make new Sprite and let's choose our yellow Hedgehog it's sort of like down towards the bottom and let's drag him so grab those coordinates and drag him to the bottom left of the screen of the screen the next thing we want to do is make a loop spawn five mice so those mice are going to be born in the top right hand of the screen and then go all over the place to try and make our game a little bit more difficult so the yellow Hedgehog doesn't just have a clear trajectory to the purple buddy so let's go ahead and select loops and we'll grab our repeat and we'll put our repeat right underneath our set background and then this code is for our gray Mouse so I'll just drag those other two Sprite blocks down and now instead of repeat 10 times let's go ahead and repeat five times and that just simply means hey let's make a Sprite five times okay the next thing that we want to do is go to our behaviors and drag out Sprite begins and let's go ahead and set up that purple bunny select the gray Mouse and then let's go ahead and select what Behavior we need when these five mice are born we want them to go all over the place so let's drag out wandering so what we've done is let's make five mice and one day and that's just gonna Loop and then when they are born let's have them wander all over the screen okay now let's go ahead and I want to reorder this a little bit so I selected my purple bunny Sprite and I'm gonna put him right underneath and I rolled block and then I have now I have all my blocks for my green ice and now I just want to go ahead and put my block back for my hedgehog that just makes more sense to me okay let's go ahead and press run and we see our mice being sort of born at the top right hand of the screen there's five of them and they bounce all over the place next let's go to Sprites and set size and we'll set the Hedgehog size to 50 of what it is now and let's go ahead and run our game again so it's going to be a little bit harder a little bit more challenging because the Hedgehog isn't as big now let's go ahead and give the Hedgehog the ability to move up down left and right so let's go to events when up is pressed go to Sprites select move and it's moved North 10 pixels is fine and instead of the purple bunny let's select the yellow Hedgehog now let's give it a whirl okay so I press run and then press my up arrow and there goes my little hedgehog up you can only go in One Direction right now so let's go ahead and do South left and right so let's go to events one up is pressed and instead of up let's do down and let's go ahead and go Google move and instead of 10 pixels to the north let's pick South and we run it and there he can go up and then when I press down oops I forgot to move my to change this to the yellow Hedgehog so let's change that to the yellow Hedgehog start again so now my yellow Hedgehog can move up and down up and down North and South with the up arrows and down arrows now let's go ahead and click events when left is pressed go to Sprites move 10 pixels to the West and we can remember our directions by the little saying never eat soggy waffles never North eat is Right South is down and left is West never eat soggy waffles I'm sure you guys have heard I've heard that okay so events one more when right is pressed then we're gonna go east never eat soggy waffles okay so my hedgehog should move up down right and left now when my hedgehog touches the purple bunny or I'm sorry when my hedgehog touches the mice we want him to go back to his original position that we placed him at Okay so we just told the Hedgehog to jump to a random location when it touches a gray Mouse let's go ahead and say instead of the Hedgehog jumping to a random location let's drag out a little location block so we don't need that whole big block and when the Hedgehog touches the gray mouse let's just put it back to the bottom left of the screen I have 85 by 73. you can just put it wherever you want to the bottom of the screen okay let's test it out and it is working so he is trying to I'm trying to get to the purple bunny and the gray mice are not letting me so it just um it just makes the game a little bit more challenging and a little bit more fun okay so now let's go ahead and select when the Hedgehog gets to the purple bunny what happens let's make the Hedgehog or let's make the purple bunny jump to a random location so he is going to be moving all over the place after I touch him I successfully the Hedgehog successfully touches the purple bunny he's gonna jump all over the place he's going to go to a random position Now Let's Make a Score variable so I go to variables set I to and we're going to change that I it's not going to be I let's rename this variable to score and hit create set score to and it's going to be plus 1 every time my hedgehog touches the purple bunny so let's go to math and let's grab this block right at the top here 0 2 plus and then we're going to add that little middle zero out and grab our score variable so set score to plus and then make this one so when the Hedgehog touches the purple bunny he'll jump to a random location and we'll score will go up by one now let's go to text and let's add to the screen a title that says score colon so grab text and let's take out the title and we'll grab our join and in our join in the little quotation marks there go ahead and type score colon I'll put the colon in in a minute let's take out that zero so the title screen will say score and let's go ahead and run it and see what we have okay so I'm going to go ahead and attempt to touch okay there's my score and I actually want to move that score so it is always there not just when I touch the purple bunny and I need that score system to start working but I haven't set the initial score the starting score to zero so let's go to variables set score two and let's put this right at the beginning of my blocks so let's set score two right underneath the background because I want this to be right at the beginning of my blocks let's go to map let's grab this little zero set score to zero and hit reset and run so let me try to make my way up to their purple bunny this is a little bit more challenging than I thought it would be but good kids don't like games that aren't I go up and I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it come on come on Hedgehog yay score to one now I need to add that colon so it's score you know dashes one so let's go ahead and stop I'll go down to to title screen where my join is and add a colon there and then and now let's go ahead and instead of when down is pressed let's choose all of those to be wow and run it do you see how much smoother my Hedgehog Moves so instead of when you're pressing down up left and right go ahead and change that to wow and let's add that little colon to the score and let's go ahead and play it and there is our game super easy super fun thank you so much oh honey come along
