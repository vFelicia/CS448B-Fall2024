00:00 - okay so the first thing that i did
00:03 - was i opened scratch and i'm creating a
00:06 - little vector drawing of this cute
00:07 - little turkey
00:09 - i drew out this turkey and
00:12 - then i made him in microsoft paint and
00:15 - then i uploaded him
00:17 - to scratch and i'm just gonna put him in
00:19 - the corner here
00:20 - and um use him as a little model
00:24 - for what we're creating okay
00:27 - so i've drawn this circle
00:30 - and it is a an orangish brownish
00:34 - fill with a black outline
00:38 - and size four i guess is the outline
00:41 - thickness
00:42 - and let's go ahead and draw this cute
00:44 - little turkey's
00:45 - feathers i'll go ahead and go in a
00:49 - little bit
00:50 - and i've drawn one line
00:54 - now i'm going to go ahead and put some
00:55 - points on this line
00:58 - so it's sort of towards the top there's
00:59 - an extra point
01:01 - i'm going to give him some little turkey
01:02 - feathers that are going to surround his
01:04 - big
01:04 - body so that's sort of how i want it so
01:08 - i go ahead and select it then copy and
01:10 - paste
01:12 - and whoops get rid of that guy
01:17 - [Music]
01:23 - delete okay so i'm gonna go ahead and
01:27 - flip him to where i want him
01:31 - and i'm gonna play around with this and
01:33 - then just go ahead and grab the end and
01:35 - rotate
01:36 - until i make his feather the two points
01:40 - meet at the top
01:42 - and so there's my nice little black
01:45 - outline of
01:46 - my turkey and i'm gonna group those
01:52 - together
01:54 - [Music]
01:56 - and i'm going to hit copy and paste and
01:59 - i'll make a smaller one to lay inside of
02:03 - the outside one and i'm going to color
02:05 - then color them differently
02:07 - so the first one i'm going to fill i'm
02:10 - going to go ahead and select it since
02:12 - it's grouped
02:14 - and i'm going to fill it with a brownish
02:16 - color
02:19 - so i use my color wheel and i just
02:22 - pick out a nice little brown color then
02:25 - i go ahead and select the one that is in
02:27 - the feather that is in back
02:29 - and i'll make that bright red and
02:32 - now just to add a little depth i am
02:35 - going
02:36 - to make a little bit of a darker shade
02:39 - of red
02:40 - and let me go ahead and magnify
02:44 - and then with my paintbrush just fill in
02:46 - a little corner
02:47 - of that feather
02:51 - just to make it look a little bit more
02:54 - fun
02:54 - i select it and i'm going to go ahead
02:57 - and put that a little bit towards that
02:59 - little piece a little bit towards the
03:00 - back
03:01 - so the outline is showing
03:05 - and then i went ahead and grouped the
03:07 - entire feather
03:08 - and put it toward the back so his little
03:11 - fat turkey body is way in front
03:14 - so now i'm going to go ahead and pull
03:16 - with that little darker red piece and
03:18 - make sure that i can see my outline
03:20 - okay so i have my turkey feather looking
03:24 - really super cute and i have two little
03:27 - colors on it
03:28 - red and a dark
03:31 - darker red to add a little bit of depth
03:33 - his body is a little big so i'm going to
03:35 - pull it in and i make sure that feather
03:38 - is in the back
03:40 - and i'm just sort of customizing it to
03:42 - where i like it
03:44 - and now i am going to go ahead and
03:46 - select the entire
03:48 - feather and i'm going to hit copy and
03:50 - paste
03:51 - and move it over to the other side and
03:54 - then flip horizontal
03:56 - make sure you're in your vector setting
03:58 - when you're doing this and then i'm
04:00 - going to go ahead and put that towards
04:01 - the back so it's looking pretty cute
04:02 - right now
04:04 - so now he's a big fat turkey body with
04:06 - two feathers
04:07 - so i go ahead and select another feather
04:11 - hit copy paste i'll move that one
04:14 - up a little bit put it to the back and
04:16 - sort of resize it just the way i want
04:18 - and for this guy i'm going to rotate him
04:21 - a little bit
04:21 - and then i'm going to choose different
04:23 - colors
04:25 - and i'm going to do a yellow with a
04:28 - a light yellow so there's a nice yellow
04:30 - shade and then for that little piece
04:34 - i am going to make a lighter yellow
04:36 - shade
04:37 - and then i am going to go ahead and just
04:40 - do copy paste
04:41 - for the rest of the feathers
04:56 - [Music]
05:07 - [Music]
05:13 - [Music]
05:27 - [Music]
05:46 - okay so now let's go ahead and draw the
05:48 - little turkey body
05:50 - so he's more of an oval shape
05:53 - and i'm gonna put on a lighter
05:56 - color brown for his body just to give
05:59 - him a little bit of
06:00 - depth and shade and i put that right in
06:04 - the back
06:07 - and i'm going to go ahead and sort of
06:10 - make these
06:11 - feathers towards his body a little bit
06:18 - bigger
06:21 - and then i'm going to draw some little
06:22 - feathers on his chest
06:24 - oh cute and they can be like a little
06:27 - bit funky
06:32 - and then i go ahead and select them copy
06:35 - paste
06:39 - and pull the second set down
06:54 - now let's make one eye
06:59 - and it's just completely big and black
07:02 - and let's do copy paste and make the
07:03 - second eye they're pretty close together
07:11 - and let me make him a little bit
07:14 - his body a little thinner his bottom
07:16 - feathers
07:17 - a little bit fatter
07:23 - and now i'm just going to select the
07:25 - line tool
07:27 - let's make that a little thicker
07:32 - make a line tool that is
07:35 - just straight down from the body and
07:39 - then i'm going to use my points tool and
07:41 - pull it out
07:43 - and there's his little wing fabulous
07:48 - and now i'll just do copy and paste flip
07:51 - horizontal
07:52 - and bring that back over to the other
07:56 - side
08:04 - and now let's do his little feet same
08:07 - thing make a line
08:09 - add a little point in the middle pull
08:11 - that up
08:14 - copy paste
08:18 - make sure i can flip it horizontal
08:22 - pull it over to the other side these are
08:24 - just like little claw feet
08:27 - nothing special copy paste
08:31 - flip vertical rotate it a little bit
08:35 - pull it up so they meet each other
08:38 - fantastic
08:45 - copy paste
08:49 - and after i copy paste then i'm going to
08:52 - go ahead and sort of like move that
08:53 - little
08:54 - those little lines until i get them just
08:57 - the way i want to
09:00 - and bring over
09:04 - the other guy oh cute make sure they
09:08 - meet up
09:19 - now i'd like to make a couple little
09:20 - circles for his eyes
09:22 - little white circles that make like
09:24 - little reflection points
09:27 - and just give him a little bit more life
09:30 - so i make one then i do copy and paste
09:32 - just to make sure that they are the
09:33 - exact same size
09:37 - now on my model on my original drawing i
09:41 - have
09:43 - two little circles
09:46 - in one eye and one circle and one little
09:48 - heart in the other eye
09:50 - but i don't think i'm gonna do that here
09:52 - okay let me um
09:53 - keep going on his wing here
09:58 - so i'm gonna go ahead and actually let's
10:01 - go ahead and finish those eyes
10:26 - let's go ahead and finish and fill his
10:29 - wing
10:29 - in with black so when we move his wing
10:33 - and animate it it looks as one piece
10:37 - and so we do that by adding a nice
10:40 - thick line to that elbow
10:44 - and then grouping all the pieces
10:47 - together
10:48 - so i hit my shift key on my keyboard
10:51 - i group the pieces and then i have a
10:55 - a nice one piece and then i can go to my
10:57 - fill bucket and fill with black fun
11:00 - and then i'll go ahead and do the same
11:01 - thing for the other wing
11:03 - and the feet
11:17 - okay so let's go ahead and make one of
11:20 - the most
11:20 - important features on our little guy
11:23 - which is
11:23 - his mouth
11:33 - so i want to use my line tool
11:36 - and i'm just going to make a straight
11:38 - line
11:39 - and then it's sort of like an upside
11:43 - down triangle
11:44 - and i'm going to add some points to make
11:46 - it not
11:47 - so sharp looking so my upside down
11:51 - triangle is going to have
11:52 - more rounded edges than sharp edges
11:56 - and when i have it all connected
12:02 - i am going to turn it like
12:06 - a a little orangish color just to make
12:09 - him super cute
12:15 - okay let's go ahead and draw his little
12:17 - gobbley wobbly thing
12:19 - over his nose that sort of hangs off of
12:22 - turkey's faces so i selected the square
12:25 - piece
12:26 - and then added my points with my using
12:30 - my little point tool
12:31 - and i'm just gonna shape it um
12:35 - like a it's sort of like a
12:39 - sideways v
12:43 - and i'm just going to keep adding little
12:44 - points until i get it to sort of hang
12:47 - off of his mouth
12:51 - now it's looking more like a little worm
12:54 - so i'm just adding points where i need
12:56 - to and
12:58 - then i'm going to go ahead and delete
12:59 - some points if i don't like them
13:02 - and i turn it red
13:07 - and i do like the outline there not like
13:09 - a really super
13:10 - thick outline and again i'm going to
13:13 - delete some points if i don't like them
13:16 - and i just do that by selecting on the
13:18 - point and then just hitting delete
13:40 - and i'm just going to move it it
13:42 - definitely looks like a little worm
13:45 - and it's sort of just hanging on the
13:47 - side of his nose looking super cute
14:28 - so
14:35 - now i'm going to go ahead and add some
14:37 - color
14:38 - using my square again and the same color
14:42 - from his little oval body
14:44 - so i add a square and then add points to
14:47 - it
14:47 - and now i'm just going to like shape it
14:50 - to the top
14:51 - sort of left corner of his head just to
14:54 - give
14:54 - my picture like a little depth i like
14:57 - doing shading it's the same type of
14:59 - shading that we did with his little
15:00 - feathers
15:01 - in the corner we just did like a darker
15:04 - red and a lighter yellow and so we're
15:08 - going to do like this little half moon
15:10 - shape that is going to go um
15:13 - on the top of the corner of his little
15:15 - head and i do two different colors
15:18 - a little bit lighter shades again to
15:21 - give him some nice depth
15:24 - and make him look more realistic a
15:26 - realistic
15:27 - cartoon turkey yes that's what we're
15:30 - going for
16:37 - now i'm going to add a little bit of
16:39 - that lighter shade underneath his
16:42 - chin underneath his big head basically
16:45 - on his little
16:45 - the top of his little oval body and i
16:48 - just do that
16:51 - all right so we have our cute little
16:53 - turkey he is just
16:54 - fabulous looking let's go ahead and add
16:57 - some
16:58 - code and our farm background in scratch
17:02 - so he um can make a gobbley sound that
17:05 - we
17:06 - upload from freesounds.org
17:09 - okay this is our end
17:13 - oh look how cute he is this is gobbly
17:16 - gobbley let's do
17:19 - oh my gosh so cute okay so let's go back
17:21 - and see how we're doing this
17:24 - okay so after we have our little turkey
17:27 - looking super cute the way we want him
17:29 - to
17:30 - we go into our backdrops and we upload
17:32 - the farm
17:33 - backdrop right here so it's perfect
17:36 - perfect colors
17:37 - fantastic love him so much now
17:41 - we go into our cute turkey
17:44 - and i've made
17:47 - a bunch of duplicates of him
17:51 - how many duplicates 29 duplicates each
17:54 - of them
17:55 - slightly different so in this
17:59 - these first duplicates i am just moving
18:01 - his eyes a teeny weeny little bit
18:04 - so i select his eyes and then with my
18:07 - um mouse i just drag them over or you
18:11 - can use the arrow keys on your
18:13 - keyboard then i am making duplicates
18:16 - with his
18:17 - mouth slightly open now let's check out
18:20 - the code that i'm using
18:22 - okay so very very very
18:26 - simple code and i will link this project
18:29 - in my description so when green flag is
18:32 - clicked
18:33 - i make sure that he's at x and
18:36 - y zero coordinates i set his size to a
18:39 - hundred percent
18:41 - i clear all my graphic effects i switch
18:44 - his costume to cute turkey too which is
18:46 - my very first costume right here cute
18:49 - turkey tube
18:51 - i don't know why i named it that and i
18:53 - show him
18:54 - then i wait point one second and i have
18:58 - a repeat going
18:59 - so costume number until 29 so you're
19:02 - gonna do however many costumes you have
19:05 - i have 29
19:07 - so it repeats until it hits that very
19:10 - last costume which is mine is 29 and
19:12 - then it goes to the next costume until
19:14 - it re
19:15 - until it hits that 29 and then in a
19:18 - separate just to make it super super
19:20 - easy
19:21 - when green flag is clicked i have my
19:23 - gobbly
19:24 - turkey until done which is i just got
19:28 - that from
19:30 - freesounds.org and i just went ahead
19:33 - and looked up turkey okay and let's go
19:36 - ahead and play it again
19:40 - i sort of matched it up to how long my
19:43 - gobbly
19:44 - is fabulous super easy
19:49 - happy thanksgiving

Cleaned transcript:

okay so the first thing that i did was i opened scratch and i'm creating a little vector drawing of this cute little turkey i drew out this turkey and then i made him in microsoft paint and then i uploaded him to scratch and i'm just gonna put him in the corner here and um use him as a little model for what we're creating okay so i've drawn this circle and it is a an orangish brownish fill with a black outline and size four i guess is the outline thickness and let's go ahead and draw this cute little turkey's feathers i'll go ahead and go in a little bit and i've drawn one line now i'm going to go ahead and put some points on this line so it's sort of towards the top there's an extra point i'm going to give him some little turkey feathers that are going to surround his big body so that's sort of how i want it so i go ahead and select it then copy and paste and whoops get rid of that guy delete okay so i'm gonna go ahead and flip him to where i want him and i'm gonna play around with this and then just go ahead and grab the end and rotate until i make his feather the two points meet at the top and so there's my nice little black outline of my turkey and i'm gonna group those together and i'm going to hit copy and paste and i'll make a smaller one to lay inside of the outside one and i'm going to color then color them differently so the first one i'm going to fill i'm going to go ahead and select it since it's grouped and i'm going to fill it with a brownish color so i use my color wheel and i just pick out a nice little brown color then i go ahead and select the one that is in the feather that is in back and i'll make that bright red and now just to add a little depth i am going to make a little bit of a darker shade of red and let me go ahead and magnify and then with my paintbrush just fill in a little corner of that feather just to make it look a little bit more fun i select it and i'm going to go ahead and put that a little bit towards that little piece a little bit towards the back so the outline is showing and then i went ahead and grouped the entire feather and put it toward the back so his little fat turkey body is way in front so now i'm going to go ahead and pull with that little darker red piece and make sure that i can see my outline okay so i have my turkey feather looking really super cute and i have two little colors on it red and a dark darker red to add a little bit of depth his body is a little big so i'm going to pull it in and i make sure that feather is in the back and i'm just sort of customizing it to where i like it and now i am going to go ahead and select the entire feather and i'm going to hit copy and paste and move it over to the other side and then flip horizontal make sure you're in your vector setting when you're doing this and then i'm going to go ahead and put that towards the back so it's looking pretty cute right now so now he's a big fat turkey body with two feathers so i go ahead and select another feather hit copy paste i'll move that one up a little bit put it to the back and sort of resize it just the way i want and for this guy i'm going to rotate him a little bit and then i'm going to choose different colors and i'm going to do a yellow with a a light yellow so there's a nice yellow shade and then for that little piece i am going to make a lighter yellow shade and then i am going to go ahead and just do copy paste for the rest of the feathers okay so now let's go ahead and draw the little turkey body so he's more of an oval shape and i'm gonna put on a lighter color brown for his body just to give him a little bit of depth and shade and i put that right in the back and i'm going to go ahead and sort of make these feathers towards his body a little bit bigger and then i'm going to draw some little feathers on his chest oh cute and they can be like a little bit funky and then i go ahead and select them copy paste and pull the second set down now let's make one eye and it's just completely big and black and let's do copy paste and make the second eye they're pretty close together and let me make him a little bit his body a little thinner his bottom feathers a little bit fatter and now i'm just going to select the line tool let's make that a little thicker make a line tool that is just straight down from the body and then i'm going to use my points tool and pull it out and there's his little wing fabulous and now i'll just do copy and paste flip horizontal and bring that back over to the other side and now let's do his little feet same thing make a line add a little point in the middle pull that up copy paste make sure i can flip it horizontal pull it over to the other side these are just like little claw feet nothing special copy paste flip vertical rotate it a little bit pull it up so they meet each other fantastic copy paste and after i copy paste then i'm going to go ahead and sort of like move that little those little lines until i get them just the way i want to and bring over the other guy oh cute make sure they meet up now i'd like to make a couple little circles for his eyes little white circles that make like little reflection points and just give him a little bit more life so i make one then i do copy and paste just to make sure that they are the exact same size now on my model on my original drawing i have two little circles in one eye and one circle and one little heart in the other eye but i don't think i'm gonna do that here okay let me um keep going on his wing here so i'm gonna go ahead and actually let's go ahead and finish those eyes let's go ahead and finish and fill his wing in with black so when we move his wing and animate it it looks as one piece and so we do that by adding a nice thick line to that elbow and then grouping all the pieces together so i hit my shift key on my keyboard i group the pieces and then i have a a nice one piece and then i can go to my fill bucket and fill with black fun and then i'll go ahead and do the same thing for the other wing and the feet okay so let's go ahead and make one of the most important features on our little guy which is his mouth so i want to use my line tool and i'm just going to make a straight line and then it's sort of like an upside down triangle and i'm going to add some points to make it not so sharp looking so my upside down triangle is going to have more rounded edges than sharp edges and when i have it all connected i am going to turn it like a a little orangish color just to make him super cute okay let's go ahead and draw his little gobbley wobbly thing over his nose that sort of hangs off of turkey's faces so i selected the square piece and then added my points with my using my little point tool and i'm just gonna shape it um like a it's sort of like a sideways v and i'm just going to keep adding little points until i get it to sort of hang off of his mouth now it's looking more like a little worm so i'm just adding points where i need to and then i'm going to go ahead and delete some points if i don't like them and i turn it red and i do like the outline there not like a really super thick outline and again i'm going to delete some points if i don't like them and i just do that by selecting on the point and then just hitting delete and i'm just going to move it it definitely looks like a little worm and it's sort of just hanging on the side of his nose looking super cute so now i'm going to go ahead and add some color using my square again and the same color from his little oval body so i add a square and then add points to it and now i'm just going to like shape it to the top sort of left corner of his head just to give my picture like a little depth i like doing shading it's the same type of shading that we did with his little feathers in the corner we just did like a darker red and a lighter yellow and so we're going to do like this little half moon shape that is going to go um on the top of the corner of his little head and i do two different colors a little bit lighter shades again to give him some nice depth and make him look more realistic a realistic cartoon turkey yes that's what we're going for now i'm going to add a little bit of that lighter shade underneath his chin underneath his big head basically on his little the top of his little oval body and i just do that all right so we have our cute little turkey he is just fabulous looking let's go ahead and add some code and our farm background in scratch so he um can make a gobbley sound that we upload from freesounds.org okay this is our end oh look how cute he is this is gobbly gobbley let's do oh my gosh so cute okay so let's go back and see how we're doing this okay so after we have our little turkey looking super cute the way we want him to we go into our backdrops and we upload the farm backdrop right here so it's perfect perfect colors fantastic love him so much now we go into our cute turkey and i've made a bunch of duplicates of him how many duplicates 29 duplicates each of them slightly different so in this these first duplicates i am just moving his eyes a teeny weeny little bit so i select his eyes and then with my um mouse i just drag them over or you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard then i am making duplicates with his mouth slightly open now let's check out the code that i'm using okay so very very very simple code and i will link this project in my description so when green flag is clicked i make sure that he's at x and y zero coordinates i set his size to a hundred percent i clear all my graphic effects i switch his costume to cute turkey too which is my very first costume right here cute turkey tube i don't know why i named it that and i show him then i
