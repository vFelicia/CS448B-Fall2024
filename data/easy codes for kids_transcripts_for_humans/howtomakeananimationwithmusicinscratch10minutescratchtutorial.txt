00:00 - [Music]
00:11 - okay so here we are on the scratch page
00:15 - so the first thing i'm going to do is go
00:17 - over here to create
00:21 - and create a new project
00:25 - for our dancing dino project
00:30 - dancing dinosaurs dancing dinosaurs
00:32 - dancing dinosaurs that's sort of a
00:33 - little tongue twister
00:35 - dancing dinosaurs dancing dancing
00:37 - dinosaurs
00:39 - dancing dinos okay so we want to
00:43 - get rid of this guy bye bye
00:46 - and we want to go down here and we want
00:50 - to click
00:50 - choose a sprite now we are going to pick
00:54 - a dinosaur sprite that has
00:57 - four different costumes so when we run
01:00 - through his costumes
01:01 - it's going to look as if he's moving and
01:03 - dancing
01:04 - yay okay so up here
01:08 - in our search we are going to click d
01:13 - d-i-n-o-s-a-u-r
01:14 - dinosaur and let's go ahead and choose
01:17 - this guy
01:18 - so when i hover over him i can see that
01:19 - he is moving
01:21 - fabulous so i put him right there now
01:24 - i'm going to put
01:25 - all the code in this guy and then i'm
01:27 - going to right click
01:29 - and duplicate two more of him so
01:32 - it looks as if there are three dinos
01:35 - dancing
01:36 - so the first thing i am going to do
01:38 - though is i'm going to put a little code
01:39 - in him
01:47 - so i am going to go over here to
01:51 - code and go to events
01:55 - and then i'm going to drag over one
01:57 - green flag is clicked
01:59 - then i'm going to go to control
02:02 - and i'm going to drag over forever
02:06 - then i'm going to go to looks
02:11 - and i'm going to do switch
02:14 - costume to a
02:18 - i just like to go a b c d now if i do a
02:22 - b c d all in a row it will move so fast
02:26 - that my audience won't see him moving
02:28 - and dancing
02:29 - so i have to put some weights in there
02:31 - so i go to control
02:35 - and wait now if i do one second
02:40 - if i do one second let me
02:43 - go in here a little bit
02:47 - if i do one second the dinosaur
02:51 - um switching the different movements is
02:53 - going to be way too slow
02:55 - and it's going to look really bumpy so
02:58 - instead of wait one second i'm going to
03:00 - put weight
03:00 - 0.3 seconds okay and then i'm going to
03:04 - go up here and i'm going to hit i'm
03:05 - going to right click right here
03:07 - and i'm going to do duplicate and then
03:10 - i'm going to put
03:11 - that block again right
03:14 - below my first block but instead of
03:18 - switch costume to dinosaur a i'm going
03:21 - to switch it to b
03:23 - okay so you see what i did there and
03:25 - he's already moving for me
03:27 - he's already shaking his tail feather
03:29 - right
03:30 - okay so i want to go ahead and right
03:34 - here hover
03:35 - and then right click with my mouse or my
03:37 - keypad
03:38 - and hit duplicate
03:41 - and then drag that underneath
03:46 - and looky there now he's kicking his
03:48 - little leg fabulous
03:52 - i'm gonna click out
03:56 - and i'm gonna hover over dinosaur
04:00 - b and choose that dinosaur c
04:04 - and we have one more costume to choose
04:07 - from and i can tell
04:08 - that because one two three four
04:11 - different looks
04:15 - so i hover over c right click
04:18 - hit duplicate put it right there
04:23 - and instead of c i choose d so i have
04:26 - a b c d and look at him go
04:30 - oh look how cute he looks when he's
04:32 - dancing fabulous
04:35 - okay now um i am going to come over here
04:40 - and right click and hit duplicate
04:44 - so now i have two of them and they're
04:45 - sort of on top of each other so i'm
04:47 - going to move
04:48 - the next one right there now i'm going
04:51 - to go right here
04:53 - right click duplicate
04:56 - and there's my third one so i'm going to
04:59 - put them over here
05:02 - okay so now all of them
05:09 - have the capability
05:13 - of looking like this dancing guy
05:17 - i just have to put some code behind them
05:20 - so i go to dinosaur two
05:27 - okay now all of them
05:30 - are able to dance
05:33 - and kick their legs and open their
05:35 - mouths because they all have the same
05:37 - code
05:39 - so they can all be dancing to the same
05:41 - little song
05:43 - now the next thing i want to do is i
05:45 - want to put in a nice backdrop
05:48 - so i go over here to backdrop in my
05:50 - bottom right hand corner
05:52 - of my screen i click choose a backdrop
05:58 - and in my search bar
06:01 - i'm going to put dance and it brings up
06:04 - this
06:05 - spotlight background so i'm going to go
06:07 - ahead and click on that
06:09 - and this is sort of like a runway and
06:11 - here are some chairs and here's some
06:13 - speakers
06:14 - there's the spotlight and different
06:17 - lights that it's you know sort of like
06:21 - we're pretending can go
06:23 - into this stage so i'm gonna bring the
06:26 - dinosaurs
06:27 - i'm gonna spread them out a little bit
06:28 - one dinosaur is gonna be like on a
06:30 - little platform here
06:32 - and then they're all going to be dancing
06:36 - fabulous fabulous now
06:39 - everything looks really good but we're
06:41 - missing one important piece of this
06:44 - and that is our sounds
06:47 - so i'm going to have a sound run through
06:49 - the entire
06:51 - piece
06:55 - okay so the very last piece of code that
06:59 - we need to put
07:00 - into our dinos dancing is
07:03 - the sound so um
07:06 - this um dino dancing already
07:11 - this project already came with the pop
07:13 - sound
07:14 - which is just this
07:19 - let's put that up so you can hear it
07:21 - okay
07:22 - so it's just like a little pop sound so
07:24 - we're going to get rid of that because
07:25 - we want a nice
07:26 - dance beat for them to dance to so in
07:29 - the bottom left hand corner of our
07:31 - screen
07:32 - go ahead and click choose a sound
07:46 - and in the search bar let's go ahead and
07:47 - type dance
07:51 - and let's fool around with these a
07:53 - little bit so let's listen
07:59 - i like that one
08:01 - [Music]
08:09 - that one's a little funky let's see what
08:11 - this one is
08:23 - let's go ahead and choose dance around
08:30 - okay so here it is in
08:33 - our in our sounds so let's go back into
08:37 - our code
08:38 - and it doesn't matter which of the
08:39 - dinosaurs codes that we choose
08:43 - what we want to do is we want to say hey
08:45 - when
08:46 - these guys when the green flag is
08:48 - clicked start playing the song
08:51 - the dinosaurs will start moving
08:54 - when the green flag is clicked and
08:56 - forever they're going to be switching
08:57 - through their costumes
08:59 - and making it look as if they're dancing
09:01 - so the same concept we need
09:03 - for our music so when green flag is
09:07 - clicked
09:11 - go to sound and
09:15 - let's do play sound until done
09:18 - which is fine but the dinos
09:22 - are going to be dancing forever so
09:25 - maybe we need a forever in there to
09:28 - match
09:29 - so i go to my orange control i'll grab
09:33 - my
09:33 - um forever i'm going to go ahead and put
09:37 - my
09:39 - forever here so
09:42 - we have our sound actually matching
09:46 - our costume changing
09:50 - so forever our dinosaurs are going to be
09:53 - switching through their costumes
09:54 - and quote-unquote dancing and forever
09:58 - our song is going to be playing so let's
10:00 - go ahead
10:02 - and full screen
10:07 - and play
10:19 - [Music]
10:30 - you
