00:00 - okay so let's go ahead and make a really
00:03 - super simple
00:04 - voting scratch program so when i click
00:07 - on this little guy
00:09 - he barks and the dogs get a one little
00:12 - vote up here
00:13 - and if i click on this little guy
00:17 - the cat gets a vote and it just go
00:20 - it goes up by one and then when i hover
00:24 - on them
00:24 - they move just to make things a little
00:28 - bit more interactive for our
00:30 - users and then we have like this very
00:32 - simple backdrop and it says please vote
00:35 - whom do you prefer cats or dogs please
00:37 - click on me to vote
00:39 - awesome and so the first thing that i
00:43 - want to do is
00:44 - x out of my sprite cat down here bye-bye
00:48 - and i'm going to go ahead and i am going
00:51 - to
00:52 - make a sprite
00:55 - so i'm going to go over here and i am
00:58 - going to
01:00 - choose sprite and then in my sprite
01:03 - search bar i'm going to go ahead and
01:05 - type dog
01:06 - and i'm going to grab this little puppy
01:09 - dog because he is adorable
01:11 - okay there he is now i'm gonna go into
01:14 - costumes
01:15 - so right now he has a couple of
01:17 - different uh costumes he has
01:20 - doggie right doggy sit
01:23 - side and sort of the back of him so i'm
01:26 - going to get rid of these two
01:27 - one two so what i want to do
01:31 - is when somebody is hovering on him i
01:34 - want him to
01:35 - be in one position and then when they
01:38 - take their
01:39 - mouse off he's in the next position
01:42 - so he's on or he's off okay
01:45 - so i leave these two costumes for him
01:48 - puppy right and puppy sit
01:50 - so he will have two when i'm hovering on
01:54 - him he'll be standing and then when i
01:56 - take my
01:57 - mouse off of him he'll be sitting okay
02:00 - now let's go ahead and go into sprite
02:04 - and create a cat sprite
02:07 - so i'm going to go ahead and click
02:08 - choose a sprite
02:11 - and in my search bar i'm going to hit
02:14 - c-a-t cat so i think
02:18 - i don't want to use sprite cat i'll just
02:21 - use cat two
02:24 - and there he is i'm gonna put him right
02:25 - here next to you know what i'm gonna put
02:27 - him underneath puppy and i'm gonna move
02:29 - puppy up here
02:30 - and put kitty down here okay now i'm
02:33 - gonna go into
02:34 - i have my cat selected i'm gonna go into
02:37 - costumes
02:38 - and i am gonna go ahead and
02:43 - right click and duplicate my kitten
02:46 - okay so i am going to select my kitten
02:51 - and um
02:55 - i want to do something with the kitten
02:58 - so when people hover on the kitten
03:02 - maybe he'll turn in the diff in a
03:04 - different direction
03:06 - i guess i could have just flipped him
03:07 - but i'm just gonna rotate him a little
03:09 - bit
03:10 - okay so when they um when they're not
03:15 - or when they're selecting him and
03:17 - they're hovering on him he's going to
03:19 - look
03:19 - to the right hand side of the screen and
03:22 - when they're
03:24 - not hovering on him he's going to look
03:27 - to the left-hand side of the screen
03:28 - so we have sort of an on off for each
03:31 - the dog
03:32 - and the cat okay and you'll understand
03:35 - more as we go along
03:37 - all right let's do some coding so i have
03:39 - my puppy selected
03:41 - and the first thing that i want to do is
03:46 - i want to go to
03:50 - um when this sprite is clicked
03:55 - because it's going to be a voting game
03:58 - and so that is in my yellow events
04:01 - and it is going to be right underneath
04:05 - it's the third choice here when this
04:07 - sprite is clicked
04:09 - and i'll pull that over
04:14 - all right what happens when this sprite
04:15 - is clicked well we need a variable
04:18 - and let's go ahead into our orange
04:20 - variables right here
04:23 - and we're going to go ahead into make a
04:26 - variable and all we're going to do
04:28 - is our variable is going to be called
04:30 - dog
04:31 - vote so type in dog vote in your
04:33 - variable name and hit ok
04:35 - and all it's going to do is it is going
04:38 - to
04:38 - every time we click on a dog our dog
04:41 - vote is gonna go up by one
04:44 - and maybe we'll hear like a little
04:45 - barking sound
04:47 - and so we know that people prefer this
04:50 - little doggie over this little kitty
04:52 - okay so people are voting for the dog
04:54 - and not the cat or
04:56 - someone will vote for the cat and not
04:57 - the dog okay
04:59 - no problem so what we're going to do to
05:02 - make the variable actually mean
05:03 - something
05:04 - is we are going to use this change
05:07 - dog vote by one so every time
05:10 - somebody clicks this little doggy it's
05:13 - going to make a vote right here
05:15 - all right first i want it to play like a
05:17 - little sound though because that's
05:18 - always fun having sounds so
05:22 - let's go ahead and play sound until done
05:26 - oh that's a cute sound that's adorable
05:29 - okay now let's go ahead and so everybody
05:32 - every time somebody
05:33 - clicks on the dog you'll hear that
05:35 - little bark now let's go into our
05:37 - controls and we're going to make a
05:38 - forever loop
05:42 - so i'm going to do forever we're going
05:45 - to switch costume
05:51 - and puppy
05:54 - sit he's puppy sit right now
06:00 - and then wait until go into our control
06:08 - wait until and let's do a touching
06:12 - so when we're touching with our mouse
06:15 - pointer
06:18 - when we're touching him with our mouse
06:19 - pointer what what's going to happen
06:21 - we're going to switch his costume
06:25 - to
06:31 - puppy right
06:35 - and wait until it's not touching it and
06:38 - it's going to go back to it
06:39 - to puppy sit
06:42 - so we need another little piece of code
06:46 - here that says
06:47 - not
06:54 - so wait until
07:00 - slide this wait until not
07:06 - and we'll grab this touching again
07:08 - touching
07:10 - then he's going to go back to puppy sit
07:13 - so if we
07:14 - are touching puppy sit
07:18 - then he is gonna go to sort of um stand
07:21 - up and go to the right
07:23 - and when we're not touching him he's
07:24 - gonna sit
07:26 - so when we're not touching him he sits
07:29 - when we're touching him
07:30 - he goes up and to the right that's just
07:33 - what this little
07:34 - forever loop does okay so the forever
07:38 - loop what it does
07:39 - is when we're not touching him the puppy
07:42 - is sitting
07:42 - voila when we do touch him
07:45 - the puppy stands up and he's angled to
07:48 - the right a little bit of the screen
07:50 - so not touching sitting touching
07:53 - standing up
07:54 - not touching touching not touching
07:56 - touching awesome
07:57 - okay and then people are going to be
08:00 - voting too so if i click on him
08:03 - he barks and there's one more vote for
08:05 - the doggies
08:07 - but i i can hover on him and i can point
08:10 - to him
08:10 - that won't give him a doggy vote and
08:12 - that won't make him bark
08:14 - i have to click on him to hear that bark
08:17 - and to get the vote
08:18 - okay so now we want to do the exact same
08:21 - thing for the kitten
08:23 - okay and so a quick way to do this
08:38 - is
08:41 - so what i did was i sort of pulled this
08:43 - into my backpack
08:46 - and here it is in my backpack and then
08:48 - it which is at the bottom of my screen
08:50 - and then i was able to drag it into my
08:51 - cat
08:53 - okay so now i see code for my dog
08:57 - my puppy and my cat
09:00 - okay so but now the cat doesn't make any
09:03 - sense because it has puppy code
09:05 - so let's go ahead and make this make
09:09 - sense
09:11 - why is there a duplicate i'll just bloop
09:14 - get rid of the duplicate
09:16 - okay so just one all right now
09:20 - let's go ahead and make that variable so
09:23 - i go into variables make a variable
09:27 - and i'm going to write cat vote in the
09:29 - new variable name
09:31 - and hit ok and form i'm going to go
09:35 - ahead and change
09:36 - this to my
09:39 - so that means i'm going to go ahead and
09:41 - instead of it being a dog vote i'll
09:43 - change it to cat vote
09:44 - and that just means change cat vote by
09:47 - one
09:48 - all right so every time i click this the
09:50 - kitty
09:51 - will get a little vote right here now i
09:54 - don't want to play
09:57 - my dog sound oh fortunately there's a
10:00 - meow sound
10:02 - okay now i don't want the switch costume
10:05 - to puppy sit
10:06 - i want it to cat two and then
10:12 - cat three all right now let's check out
10:13 - what we have
10:15 - so if i hover he's cat two
10:19 - and if i take him away he should be cat
10:21 - three
10:23 - let me make sure my costumes are labeled
10:25 - correctly
