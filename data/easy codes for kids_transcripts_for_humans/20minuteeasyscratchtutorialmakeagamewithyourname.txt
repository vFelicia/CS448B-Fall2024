00:05 - so the first thing that we want to do is
00:08 - get rid of this little sprite cat right
00:11 - here we do not want him we don't need
00:13 - him so let's go ahead and click on this
00:17 - x over our sprite cat bye-bye okay the
00:24 - next thing that we want to do is we want
00:27 - to choose the sprites of our first names
00:30 - so I have a long first name it's
00:33 - Stephanie so I'm just gonna do stuff but
00:37 - you do whatever first name you'd like so
00:41 - if that's your whole name or if it's a
00:43 - nickname whatever you'd like go ahead
00:45 - and let's grab those sprites so what I
00:49 - do here is I go to my sprite window
00:52 - which is right down here in my bottom
00:54 - right-hand corner and I click on choose
00:58 - a sprite now we have all kinds of
01:06 - different categories of sprites the
01:09 - category that I'm most interested right
01:12 - now for this assignment is called
01:13 - litterers so I click on this letters tab
01:18 - right here so I hit s there is my little
01:23 - s sprite right there
01:30 - awesome so I just click on it and there
01:37 - it is next to my s and I can see it up
01:41 - here in my preview menu and my preview
01:44 - window so I'm going to go ahead and move
01:45 - it over a little bit just so they have
01:47 - their own space and now I go ahead and
01:52 - here I click choose sprite again and I
01:56 - go to letters and my next letter is an e
02:03 - and I like them sort of staggered like
02:06 - that and then I click on choose sprite
02:10 - again and I go to letters and I choose P
02:19 - and I move that over and then I go to
02:25 - choose sprite and I choose H and that'll
02:31 - do it stuff I'm gonna go ahead and pick
02:34 - on the first letter of my first name and
02:37 - that's where I'm going to add some
02:39 - coding so I am going to say when I click
02:45 - on this piece of code it's gonna go
02:49 - ahead and perform the code that I am
02:52 - telling it to perform so let me drag out
02:57 - say hello so when I click on this my s
03:04 - says hello so when I click on this my s
03:10 - says hello okay so I don't want to have
03:15 - to click on my piece of code I just want
03:18 - to click on something to initiate or to
03:21 - start all of my code at once so I'm
03:25 - gonna do a kick off event so I'm gonna
03:27 - go down here into my yellow events and I
03:32 - am going to drag over the very first
03:34 - event that says when green flag is
03:37 - clicked so I can click here and when
03:41 - green flag is clicked my little s says
03:43 - hello
03:43 - [Music]
03:45 - awesome okay now let's go back into the
03:48 - looks because this has a lot of cool
03:51 - things in it okay so instead of it just
03:56 - saying hello on the letter s for two
03:58 - seconds let's go ahead and do change
04:02 - size by ten and we'll put that right
04:05 - underneath hello I'm the letter S so
04:09 - let's see what happens
04:10 - shall we click on this hello on the
04:14 - letter S and it grew bigger by ten now
04:18 - it's a little bit of a slight movement
04:21 - so it just grew bigger just a little
04:24 - tiny bit so we couldn't see it that much
04:26 - so every time I click that green flag
04:29 - the S grows a little bit bigger but what
04:33 - if I want to play this over and over
04:35 - again I don't want that s to get huge
04:37 - huge huge huge so why don't I have it
04:40 - get bigger and wait for a second and
04:44 - then get smaller again what do you think
04:46 - pretty cool okay I think it's pretty
04:48 - useful too to understand how that works
04:51 - so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
04:54 - over here into our orange control
04:56 - underneath events so our orange control
04:59 - here and it says wait it's the very
05:02 - first code let's go ahead and stick that
05:05 - under change size by 10 and it's wait
05:08 - one second okay so let's go ahead and
05:11 - make that wait two seconds and let's
05:16 - change the size by 100 now if I wanted
05:21 - to
05:22 - it took shoot to 100 like make it huge
05:25 - and then wait and then go small again
05:29 - and go to like it's normal size what do
05:32 - you think I would need to do to make
05:36 - that size change back so for every
05:39 - action there is a reaction
05:42 - and maybe an equal reaction so maybe I
05:45 - should do a negative 100 so I'll go into
05:49 - my looks and I will go to change size by
05:56 - if there's a negative equal reaction it
05:59 - would be negative 100 okay and now we
06:05 - can check it really super easily all we
06:07 - have to do is just click the green flag
06:10 - so it says hello then it grows weights
06:14 - two seconds and goes back awesome okay
06:18 - so now that's all for letter s oh let's
06:24 - do one more thing on that s let's add a
06:27 - sound effect so let's go over here to
06:30 - our pink sounds and let's do the pop
06:34 - sound hello I'm the letter S grow big
06:39 - grow small awesome okay so we have a
06:43 - quite a little bit of code under s let's
06:47 - do something for T so I want to go ahead
06:49 - and click on that T let's do the same
06:54 - thing when the green flag is clicked
06:56 - it's gonna kick off a series of events
06:59 - and what series of events do we want it
07:01 - to do turn 15 degrees then how about
07:08 - instead of 15 degrees we turn 90 degrees
07:11 - and then we wait so go into our orange
07:18 - put our weight down here and let's wait
07:21 - for two seconds okay then let's turn
07:26 - back again okay so we could either do
07:30 - this 90 degrees not negative 90 degrees
07:33 - so it's an equal turning back or let's
07:37 - see what other motions we have let's
07:41 - turn it together right
07:43 - then let's turn it the other way 90
07:45 - degrees again okay Armel just experiment
07:48 - so let's see what this looks like
07:50 - so I'll click my green flag okay so my
07:57 - ass does all of its little goodies and
08:00 - let's look at T it turns it rotates and
08:04 - then it wrote to init weights and then
08:06 - it rotates back hmm
08:08 - it's okay it's a start but I don't it's
08:12 - real small and it just goes bloop bloop
08:16 - okay so I don't necessarily think that
08:19 - that's a lot of bang for our buck let's
08:23 - go into looks
08:27 - let's do change color so let's do after
08:42 - it rotate change color effect by 25 okay
08:48 - that's pretty cool so it turns from this
08:51 - aqua color to this negative or to this
08:54 - dark blue color so let's see this all
08:57 - together
09:02 - okay let's click it again and see what
09:04 - color it goes to now because it's gonna
09:06 - keep changing colors I bet oh no it's
09:10 - the color effect did not change that
09:12 - okay let's try instead of color let's
09:14 - try fishtail
09:23 - no fisheye let's try whirl
09:32 - okay the effect is pretty like slight
09:35 - and subtle so let's do world by 50 okay
09:42 - now I can see the T is definitely a
09:45 - little bit more crooked instead of whirl
09:48 - lets do ghost see what happens
09:53 - oh it's fit it's faded quite a bit here
09:58 - let's go back to color
10:03 - let's turn more purple now let's see if
10:08 - it stays purple okay it's sort of a dark
10:12 - purple when we do it okay I like that
10:14 - let's add a sound to that sound effects
10:19 - now I don't want to use the pop sound so
10:22 - let's go ahead and click on our sound
10:25 - tab and let's go in to choose a sound
10:35 - let's try our trumpet so I just click on
10:41 - it it's okay let's do alert hmm that's
10:55 - cool okay let's try that one okay so
11:00 - that's alert so we go into code
11:04 - yeah and play sound alert so let's see
11:09 - here let's do this let's put it towards
11:12 - the end so we don't have two sounds on
11:19 - top of each other let's see if it works
11:24 - okay so we had the pop on s as soon as
11:29 - we clicked and that alert sound doesn't
11:33 - go until maybe like three seconds later
11:36 - so that's good okay cool give them some
11:41 - room here
11:48 - okay now let's go to letter e let's
11:52 - click on letter E and let's do our
11:58 - kickoff event of this green flag and
12:01 - let's still look and let's do let's do a
12:13 - set color so let's do instead of a 50
12:21 - because we have the 50 for the T let's
12:23 - do 10 and see what this looks like so
12:30 - this turned like a lighter blue so I
12:32 - like that now let's make it let's do set
12:44 - size by a hundred and fifty percent then
12:50 - let's wait so we'll go to our control
12:53 - and let's get wait and let's wait two
12:57 - seconds and then let's do an equal
13:00 - reaction the other way so let's go to
13:02 - looks set size and we'll do negative 150
13:12 - and then let's try it out
13:21 - it shrunk way way way way way down so it
13:25 - didn't go back to its original size so
13:28 - let's go back to its original size which
13:30 - is just a hundred percent so let's try
13:34 - it out
13:36 - okay that's better so we went to set set
13:41 - size to 150 percent we wait two seconds
13:46 - and then we say okay set it back to its
13:48 - original size which is a hundred percent
13:50 - okay so I like that that's much better
13:52 - you know let's give this guy its own
13:55 - sound
13:58 - let's give eat its own sound so let's go
14:04 - into sounds and let's do choose a sound
14:15 - and let's go to the category wacky which
14:21 - is it on the end here
14:22 - and oh let's try to da that's kind of
14:37 - cute okay so let's go into our code yeah
14:40 - and we have the e here and let's set
14:47 - sound to da
14:51 - okay so let's click on the green flag
14:53 - hello I'm the letter
14:56 - [Music]
14:57 - okay now alert sound and the tada sound
15:01 - are playing at the same time so I don't
15:04 - like that so let's do instead of let's
15:07 - hit another wait in here let's wait two
15:15 - seconds and let's try it out okay
15:23 - [Music]
15:27 - so we have the S growing bigger making a
15:31 - sound the T changing a color the e
15:34 - changing a color and making a sound and
15:36 - growing bigger and going back to its
15:39 - original size what should we do for the
15:40 - letter P okay maybe we do something
15:45 - simple like let's move ten steps well
15:51 - let's do our kick off of that when green
15:54 - flag is clicked move ten steps and then
16:01 - let's wait and we'll wait two seconds
16:06 - and then let's move ten steps again in
16:12 - the other direction so we'll do negative
16:16 - ten and let's do let's try it out okay
16:34 - let's try it out
16:35 - oh I see it it's okay let's try it it's
16:47 - B and then negative 50 let's try it okay
16:57 - I like that
16:59 - and then finally let's do our each so we
17:05 - go to events and we go ahead and click
17:08 - that when green flag is clicked now
17:12 - let's see let's go to our can let's go
17:15 - to our motion and let's go to
17:24 - point in direction let's see what
17:26 - happens when we point in direction
17:34 - [Music]
17:36 - nothing much happened huh let's have the
17:41 - letter H instead of pointing her in a
17:46 - direction let's still say goodbye now
18:05 - it's sort of too busy it doesn't say
18:08 - goodbye right at the end of the sequence
18:10 - of everything happening so let's do a
18:13 - wait here
18:17 - and let's do a wait for 10 seconds
18:26 - [Music]
18:33 - hmmm that's okay but it's a little long
18:37 - let's do okay not bad not bad at all
18:59 - okay but let's see the pH are too
19:03 - similar for me there there's a pink
19:06 - color
19:06 - so in this age let's go into costumes
19:11 - and we see that letter each there I
19:14 - wonder if I can change that to be a
19:16 - little bit different costume so instead
19:21 - of the fill being this aqua color why
19:25 - don't we change it to be a nice sort of
19:28 - reddish color what do you think okay so
19:33 - let's see if we can do that oh that
19:38 - looks good
19:39 - okay let's go back into our code and
19:43 - let's hit our go again hello I'm the
19:46 - letter F here and then each says goodbye
19:55 - okay that is all for lesson 2 I can't
20:00 - wait to see what you've done
20:01 - check out our little quiz on lesson 2
20:05 - and come back for lesson 3 because we're
20:08 - going to take all these things that we
20:10 - have just learned and learned even more
20:12 - I can't wait

Cleaned transcript:

so the first thing that we want to do is get rid of this little sprite cat right here we do not want him we don't need him so let's go ahead and click on this x over our sprite cat byebye okay the next thing that we want to do is we want to choose the sprites of our first names so I have a long first name it's Stephanie so I'm just gonna do stuff but you do whatever first name you'd like so if that's your whole name or if it's a nickname whatever you'd like go ahead and let's grab those sprites so what I do here is I go to my sprite window which is right down here in my bottom righthand corner and I click on choose a sprite now we have all kinds of different categories of sprites the category that I'm most interested right now for this assignment is called litterers so I click on this letters tab right here so I hit s there is my little s sprite right there awesome so I just click on it and there it is next to my s and I can see it up here in my preview menu and my preview window so I'm going to go ahead and move it over a little bit just so they have their own space and now I go ahead and here I click choose sprite again and I go to letters and my next letter is an e and I like them sort of staggered like that and then I click on choose sprite again and I go to letters and I choose P and I move that over and then I go to choose sprite and I choose H and that'll do it stuff I'm gonna go ahead and pick on the first letter of my first name and that's where I'm going to add some coding so I am going to say when I click on this piece of code it's gonna go ahead and perform the code that I am telling it to perform so let me drag out say hello so when I click on this my s says hello so when I click on this my s says hello okay so I don't want to have to click on my piece of code I just want to click on something to initiate or to start all of my code at once so I'm gonna do a kick off event so I'm gonna go down here into my yellow events and I am going to drag over the very first event that says when green flag is clicked so I can click here and when green flag is clicked my little s says hello awesome okay now let's go back into the looks because this has a lot of cool things in it okay so instead of it just saying hello on the letter s for two seconds let's go ahead and do change size by ten and we'll put that right underneath hello I'm the letter S so let's see what happens shall we click on this hello on the letter S and it grew bigger by ten now it's a little bit of a slight movement so it just grew bigger just a little tiny bit so we couldn't see it that much so every time I click that green flag the S grows a little bit bigger but what if I want to play this over and over again I don't want that s to get huge huge huge huge so why don't I have it get bigger and wait for a second and then get smaller again what do you think pretty cool okay I think it's pretty useful too to understand how that works so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go over here into our orange control underneath events so our orange control here and it says wait it's the very first code let's go ahead and stick that under change size by 10 and it's wait one second okay so let's go ahead and make that wait two seconds and let's change the size by 100 now if I wanted to it took shoot to 100 like make it huge and then wait and then go small again and go to like it's normal size what do you think I would need to do to make that size change back so for every action there is a reaction and maybe an equal reaction so maybe I should do a negative 100 so I'll go into my looks and I will go to change size by if there's a negative equal reaction it would be negative 100 okay and now we can check it really super easily all we have to do is just click the green flag so it says hello then it grows weights two seconds and goes back awesome okay so now that's all for letter s oh let's do one more thing on that s let's add a sound effect so let's go over here to our pink sounds and let's do the pop sound hello I'm the letter S grow big grow small awesome okay so we have a quite a little bit of code under s let's do something for T so I want to go ahead and click on that T let's do the same thing when the green flag is clicked it's gonna kick off a series of events and what series of events do we want it to do turn 15 degrees then how about instead of 15 degrees we turn 90 degrees and then we wait so go into our orange put our weight down here and let's wait for two seconds okay then let's turn back again okay so we could either do this 90 degrees not negative 90 degrees so it's an equal turning back or let's see what other motions we have let's turn it together right then let's turn it the other way 90 degrees again okay Armel just experiment so let's see what this looks like so I'll click my green flag okay so my ass does all of its little goodies and let's look at T it turns it rotates and then it wrote to init weights and then it rotates back hmm it's okay it's a start but I don't it's real small and it just goes bloop bloop okay so I don't necessarily think that that's a lot of bang for our buck let's go into looks let's do change color so let's do after it rotate change color effect by 25 okay that's pretty cool so it turns from this aqua color to this negative or to this dark blue color so let's see this all together okay let's click it again and see what color it goes to now because it's gonna keep changing colors I bet oh no it's the color effect did not change that okay let's try instead of color let's try fishtail no fisheye let's try whirl okay the effect is pretty like slight and subtle so let's do world by 50 okay now I can see the T is definitely a little bit more crooked instead of whirl lets do ghost see what happens oh it's fit it's faded quite a bit here let's go back to color let's turn more purple now let's see if it stays purple okay it's sort of a dark purple when we do it okay I like that let's add a sound to that sound effects now I don't want to use the pop sound so let's go ahead and click on our sound tab and let's go in to choose a sound let's try our trumpet so I just click on it it's okay let's do alert hmm that's cool okay let's try that one okay so that's alert so we go into code yeah and play sound alert so let's see here let's do this let's put it towards the end so we don't have two sounds on top of each other let's see if it works okay so we had the pop on s as soon as we clicked and that alert sound doesn't go until maybe like three seconds later so that's good okay cool give them some room here okay now let's go to letter e let's click on letter E and let's do our kickoff event of this green flag and let's still look and let's do let's do a set color so let's do instead of a 50 because we have the 50 for the T let's do 10 and see what this looks like so this turned like a lighter blue so I like that now let's make it let's do set size by a hundred and fifty percent then let's wait so we'll go to our control and let's get wait and let's wait two seconds and then let's do an equal reaction the other way so let's go to looks set size and we'll do negative 150 and then let's try it out it shrunk way way way way way down so it didn't go back to its original size so let's go back to its original size which is just a hundred percent so let's try it out okay that's better so we went to set set size to 150 percent we wait two seconds and then we say okay set it back to its original size which is a hundred percent okay so I like that that's much better you know let's give this guy its own sound let's give eat its own sound so let's go into sounds and let's do choose a sound and let's go to the category wacky which is it on the end here and oh let's try to da that's kind of cute okay so let's go into our code yeah and we have the e here and let's set sound to da okay so let's click on the green flag hello I'm the letter okay now alert sound and the tada sound are playing at the same time so I don't like that so let's do instead of let's hit another wait in here let's wait two seconds and let's try it out okay so we have the S growing bigger making a sound the T changing a color the e changing a color and making a sound and growing bigger and going back to its original size what should we do for the letter P okay maybe we do something simple like let's move ten steps well let's do our kick off of that when green flag is clicked move ten steps and then let's wait and we'll wait two seconds and then let's move ten steps again in the other direction so we'll do negative ten and let's do let's try it out okay let's try it out oh I see it it's okay let's try it it's B and then negative 50 let's try it okay I like that and then finally let's do our each so we go to events and we go ahead and click that when green flag is clicked now let's see let's go to our can let's go to our motion and let's go to point in direction let's see what happens when we point in direction nothing much happened huh let's have the letter H instead of pointing her in a direction let's still say goodbye now it's sort of too busy it doesn't say goodbye right at the end of the sequence of everything happening so let's do a wait here and let's do a wait for 10 seconds hmmm that's okay but it's a little long let's do okay not bad not bad at all okay but let's see the pH are too similar for me there there's a pink color so in this age let's go into costumes and we see that letter each there I wonder if I can change that to be a little bit different costume so instead of the fill being this aqua color why don't we change it to be a nice sort of reddish color what do you think okay so let's see if we can do that oh that looks good okay let's go back into our code and let's hit our go again hello I'm the letter F here and then each says goodbye okay that is all for lesson 2 I can't wait to see what you've done check out our little quiz on lesson 2 and come back for lesson 3 because we're going to take all these things that we have just learned and learned even more I can't wait
