00:01 - hi let's make a roblox type game in
00:04 - scratch
00:04 - this tutorial is not for beginners the
00:07 - objective of this game is
00:08 - easy to make money and play the lotto
00:12 - the lotto is super easy
00:16 - just click the click me button and guess
00:19 - a number from
00:20 - 1 to 10. if you lose a red screen
00:24 - appears and your make money account goes
00:26 - down by one point
00:27 - if you win a green screen appears and
00:30 - you gain a point
00:32 - but to play the lotto you must first
00:35 - make
00:35 - money now in this tutorial you can
00:39 - learn about the three different jobs
00:42 - and about how we play the lotto
00:45 - step one let's create three different
00:48 - jobs with three different sprites
00:50 - there's the pizza shop guy or gal
00:53 - he chases brown bread avoiding green
00:56 - bread
00:57 - and his job is the easiest so he only
01:00 - earns one
01:00 - point for every single piece of bread he
01:04 - catches all right the candy store guy
01:07 - or gal he chases little colored hearts
01:10 - and avoids the dark hearts super simple
01:14 - there he is in that fun little
01:15 - background he goes up down all around
01:18 - and he gets two points for everything
01:20 - that he catches
01:21 - the flower shop guy this is the hardest
01:23 - level watch out for the bad guy there is
01:26 - a bad guy
01:27 - in this uh job and he is coming after
01:31 - you with his ray gun
01:32 - and um the flower shop guy actually
01:35 - tries to catch the little beetle
01:37 - and he wins three points when he does
01:38 - all right step two let's go ahead and
01:41 - upload three different colored strips of
01:43 - running sprites
01:44 - and then in step three we're going to
01:47 - make
01:48 - each sprite into its own costume so
01:50 - let's go ahead and unpack that
01:52 - so there are my six um
01:55 - little flower shop guys and they are
01:59 - all in a state of running so i uploaded
02:02 - the entire
02:03 - strip of them and now i'm just gonna go
02:06 - ahead and put each of them
02:08 - in their own different costume
02:11 - and then i'm going to go ahead and label
02:13 - them
02:15 - run right one through six
02:19 - so i'm just duplicating
02:22 - and copying pasting here so they're all
02:25 - in their own
02:26 - little costume so there's
02:29 - run right one two three four five and
02:33 - six
02:34 - and then we're going to add some code so
02:36 - it looks as if
02:38 - they are running
02:45 - okay now let's go ahead and duplicate
02:47 - them and
02:48 - turn them flip them horizontal and turn
02:51 - them to the left
02:52 - and then label them run left one through
02:55 - six
02:57 - easy easy easy and with these stripes or
03:00 - these uh sprites we are going to be able
03:04 - to run
03:04 - not only right and left but also up and
03:16 - down
03:18 - go ahead and place the all the rights
03:20 - together and all the lefts together all
03:21 - right step
03:22 - four let's code the sprites to run let's
03:25 - stay with
03:26 - our red flower guy so we're gonna code
03:28 - them to run
03:29 - up down left and right and it's actually
03:33 - really simple we're going to use blocks
03:36 - so first let's go ahead and code run
03:39 - left
03:42 - alright so choose make a block and let's
03:44 - call it run left
03:50 - now let's go ahead and choose switch
03:52 - costume to
03:53 - run left one
03:57 - then change x by negative 10 because
04:00 - we're running
04:00 - to the left side of our screen then
04:03 - we're gonna do
04:04 - uh weight point zero one seconds
04:07 - then let's go ahead and add next costume
04:10 - now let's click that run block oops
04:12 - can you see my mistake
04:15 - instead of run left i have run right so
04:17 - let's go ahead and switch that and now
04:19 - he looks right
04:20 - yay or left
04:23 - there he goes
04:27 - now let's go ahead and add a key here
04:30 - our left key so when we type it on the
04:34 - keyboard
04:34 - he actually runs to the left so i
04:37 - dragged out my when green flag is
04:38 - clicked then a forever loop
04:40 - then an if then and
04:43 - key when left arrow is pressed
04:48 - drag in our run left block
04:55 - and let's add a couple more things
04:58 - set point direction in can you guess it
05:02 - negative 90. so he points to the left
05:07 - and let's set his rotation style
05:10 - for don't rotate so he doesn't flip over
05:14 - and let's try it out okay looks pretty
05:17 - good
05:21 - all right now let's run right so my
05:24 - block
05:24 - let's name it run right and click ok
05:35 - now let's go ahead and repeat here so
05:37 - switch costume to
05:38 - run right one
05:44 - and
05:48 - change x by 10.
05:53 - let's grab a weight 0.01 seconds
05:59 - and then let's add a next costume
06:10 - okay if we click that run right block
06:14 - he'll go ahead and he'll move and he'll
06:15 - run to the right perfect
06:18 - now let's add in our forever loop
06:22 - the same blocks and let's just duplicate
06:26 - that left arrow
06:27 - and then change some of the parameters
06:31 - so if when the key right arrow is
06:35 - pressed
06:36 - let's get rid of these guys so we don't
06:39 - need that run block
06:42 - run left we don't need that let's go
06:44 - ahead and grab
06:45 - our run right block
06:48 - and then instead of point in direction
06:53 - instead of point in direction negative
06:55 - 90
06:56 - we plane in direction 90
07:00 - and then let's leave that don't rotate
07:04 - and make sure that that block is right
07:07 - underneath it forever
07:08 - okay so there is our running left
07:13 - and our running right perfect
07:17 - easy all right now let's run up and run
07:20 - down
07:28 - so go ahead and click make a block hit
07:31 - okay
07:33 - and run up and hit okay again
07:37 - now you know the drill switch costume
07:44 - and this is going to be left
07:49 - so run left
07:53 - they're all left except the right
07:56 - so left up and down are all
07:59 - left costumes all right change y
08:03 - by 10 because we're running up which is
08:06 - in positive
08:07 - territory wait .01 seconds again
08:10 - and then go ahead and grab that switch
08:13 - costume
08:15 - perfect now let's test it out
08:19 - we can just go ahead and click let's go
08:22 - ahead and duplicate
08:23 - that left arrow and
08:26 - choose the up arrow key get rid of
08:30 - those blocks underneath choose the run
08:33 - up block perfect
08:36 - point in direction can you guess the
08:39 - direction we're going to point in
08:44 - 180 and let's set a rotation style of
08:48 - all around now i think that there are
08:51 - different parameters that we can use i'm
08:52 - wondering if any of you
08:54 - know how to run up and not use those
08:57 - so just let me know in the comments okay
09:00 - so our run up is working
09:02 - left right
09:06 - up can't go any further up awesome
09:13 - i like how he drags his leg okay let's
09:15 - go ahead and make down
09:17 - so make a block call it run down hit
09:22 - okay
09:31 - let's go ahead and switch costume two
09:36 - left
09:40 - and then change by
09:46 - negative 10 good
09:52 - and then let's add our weight 0.01
09:55 - seconds
09:59 - and then let's add our next costume
10:13 - okay let's go ahead and duplicate that
10:14 - up
10:16 - let's make it a down take out that run
10:19 - up block
10:20 - put in our run or our um run down block
10:26 - and then point direction can you guess
10:29 - what this is going to be
10:30 - zero yay if you guessed zero great job
10:35 - and leave that rotation style okay let's
10:37 - see if he can run down
10:38 - yay he's running down he's running up
10:41 - left right
10:43 - up down
10:46 - left up
10:50 - awesome all right step five let's go
10:52 - ahead and create the make money variable
10:54 - without money we can't do anything this
10:58 - is super easy
10:59 - just go into variables
11:04 - click make a variable
11:07 - and for the new variable name go ahead
11:09 - and type make
11:10 - money and then you can add a dollar sign
11:13 - or two
11:14 - and hit okay all right step six let's
11:18 - upload the bad guy that lives in the
11:20 - flower shop this is the only store with
11:21 - a bad guy
11:22 - he has a deadly ray gun so i drew this
11:26 - little character with a top hat and a
11:28 - funny little gun
11:30 - and there are six of him
11:33 - seven of him and seven
11:36 - and each in a different position and
11:40 - so the same thing with the flower shop
11:43 - guy we're gonna do with the bad guy
11:45 - which is give him um his own costume
11:49 - and so the first picture of him he's
11:52 - just sort of holding his ray gun
11:54 - and the last picture of him there's just
11:57 - a puff of smoke
11:58 - so in like the fifth and sixth the puffs
12:01 - of smoke get bigger
12:02 - so it gives the illusion um
12:06 - that he is shooting this crazy
12:09 - i don't know this crazy gas gun or
12:11 - something
12:12 - so i'm just duplicating and then i copy
12:15 - and paste
12:16 - and each picture is a little bit
12:18 - different
12:19 - so when we go ahead and code him it's
12:21 - going to give the
12:24 - illusion of an animation of him actually
12:26 - moving
12:28 - and his gun going off now i can take
12:31 - that white off just by using my fill
12:36 - transparent
12:38 - and i put him right in the middle of the
12:50 - screen
12:55 - almost done
13:02 - okay perfect now make sure that you
13:04 - label all of them bad guy
13:06 - right one through seven and then let's
13:10 - go ahead and make
13:12 - you guessed it we're gonna duplicate
13:14 - these and make him
13:15 - run to the left as well all right let's
13:18 - say we're done with that
13:19 - now let's step seven code the bad guy
13:23 - so we're in the bad guy and when green
13:26 - flag is clicked
13:30 - let's go x to
13:36 - 221
13:39 - and y to negative 129.
13:43 - so we're going to be moving the bad guy
13:44 - from right to left
13:46 - across the screen and then he's gonna
13:48 - jump into a random position
13:50 - now let's add a glide one
13:54 - second to x same numbers two two one and
13:58 - negative one two nine
14:05 - now let's pull in that forever loop
14:12 - and let's go ahead and add a weight
14:15 - point one second
14:16 - we're going to make him a little faster
14:18 - than the
14:20 - red guy
14:24 - and you can adjust this however you'd
14:26 - like and make it your own game
14:28 - and then we go ahead and put in next
14:29 - costume so he looks as if he is
14:32 - really running and shooting his ray gun
14:44 - now we're going to do change y by you
14:47 - guessed it negative 5
14:48 - and you can do negative 10 you can do
14:50 - negative 7 if you want him to move
14:52 - faster
14:53 - this way he really looks um at negative
14:55 - 5. you can really see
14:56 - each pose that we've drawn all right
14:59 - let's add a
15:01 - if then statement if
15:06 - x position is less than
15:11 - 170 negative 170
15:16 - then
15:20 - go to random position awesome
15:24 - so when you get to the end of the screen
15:25 - then jump
15:33 - set x
15:37 - to 180 and let's try it out
15:41 - there he goes
15:53 - step eight let's go ahead and upload the
15:55 - beetle in the flower shop
15:56 - remember this is the objective of the
15:59 - flower shop guy
16:00 - is to catch the beetle and get three
16:02 - points stay away from the bad guy if the
16:04 - bad guy touches them
16:05 - it's minus three points so i went into
16:08 - my upload a sprite
16:10 - i'm gonna go ahead in the search bar and
16:12 - type beetle
16:13 - there's the beetle let's go ahead and
16:15 - first thing let's make him a little
16:16 - smaller
16:18 - he's a little too easy to catch that
16:20 - size so
16:22 - i go ahead and i
16:25 - draw a box around his entire body and
16:28 - just
16:29 - drag him to a smaller size okay perfect
16:32 - let's add some code when green flag is
16:35 - clicked
16:39 - show him
16:43 - and then in a forever loop
16:48 - weight point
16:53 - did i do 0.2 seconds yes 0.2 seconds
16:56 - and then hit the next costume we're
16:58 - going to make a couple more costumes for
17:00 - him
17:01 - and then wait 0.2 seconds again
17:12 - and then go to random position so he
17:14 - should be jumping all over the place
17:16 - right now let's make him look a little
17:19 - bit more like a real bug
17:21 - by um having him jump and move in a
17:23 - different
17:25 - spot so he actually does look like he's
17:28 - jumping
17:28 - so he's not always just facing to the
17:30 - right hand side so let's go ahead and
17:33 - duplicate
17:34 - this beetle so there's four different
17:36 - beetles
17:37 - and each of them should be facing a
17:39 - different way and you can use the flip
17:40 - horizontal foot vertical
17:42 - i just wanted to rotate because rotating
17:44 - is fun
18:17 - okay let's try it out hit the green flag
18:20 - okay now he looks more beatily because
18:23 - he's actually
18:24 - just sort of like jumping all over and
18:25 - moving and it
18:27 - sort of looks cute okay let's go back to
18:30 - the red
18:31 - flower guy code and i added when green
18:35 - flag is clicked
18:36 - for everloop let's go ahead and start
18:38 - adding um some things to make this into
18:41 - like a real game
18:42 - so inside the forever loop let's do if
18:45 - then statement so
18:46 - if i am touching the bad guy
18:51 - what happens then say
18:58 - ouch
19:04 - and let's do something with our money
19:07 - let's go ahead and change
19:09 - make money by negative three
19:13 - because it's a penalty we don't want to
19:15 - get hit by the
19:17 - naughty bad guy
19:20 - with his ray gun okay wait 0.1 second
19:24 - then let's go ahead and add an if then
19:27 - and let's do the same thing for the
19:28 - beetle except let's say
19:31 - got you and let's add three points
19:34 - and then we'll wait point one again so
19:36 - it's the exact same
19:38 - code for each the beetle and the bad guy
19:41 - and it's going to be the same thing in
19:42 - all of the different jobs
19:44 - we're going to say something we're going
19:46 - to have a negative and positive
19:49 - and we're going to have a little bit of
19:50 - a wait time so this is actually i'm
19:52 - trying to catch the beetle right now
19:53 - it's actually pretty hard
19:56 - okay i've seen my first mistake i don't
19:58 - like that when i
20:00 - hit the um beetle it just keeps saying
20:03 - got you
20:04 - so let's go ahead and change that
20:08 - so instead of it just saying it let's do
20:11 - a say for two seconds
20:24 - all right so let's get rid of the
20:27 - regular stay
20:28 - and we'll just have a say for two
20:29 - seconds
20:32 - so got you for two seconds and plus
20:35 - three
20:35 - and then wait point zero one second and
20:38 - let's go ahead and do the same thing for
20:41 - the um bad guy if the bad guy touches me
20:43 - i'm gonna say ouch for two seconds
20:46 - i'm gonna get a minus three on in my
20:48 - money
20:52 - and then we're gonna do a little weight
20:53 - on there too
21:04 - okay this is actually really hard to
21:06 - catch him got you yay
21:14 - he's too fast okay step nine let's go
21:17 - ahead and add a really fun moving
21:19 - background for our flower shop just to
21:21 - make things a little bit more
21:22 - interesting when we work at the flower
21:23 - shop
21:24 - so i um downloaded these
21:27 - two or this one um green
21:30 - block minecraft type back drop and
21:34 - i want to go ahead and upload it into a
21:36 - sprite
21:37 - so it's not a backdrop it's in a sprite
21:41 - so sprite sprite sprite there is my
21:44 - little green
21:46 - it's gonna be a backdrop but it's in a
21:48 - sprite um i duplicated it so i have two
21:50 - and they're gonna layer over each other
21:52 - and constantly move
21:54 - it's gonna be super cool let's make it's
21:56 - gonna make the
21:57 - flower shop an interesting place to work
21:59 - all right so let's go ahead and add a
22:01 - broadcast message
22:02 - the broadcast message is going to be
22:04 - flowers we're going to have one for
22:05 - every single job
22:07 - so if i receive flowers then i'm going
22:09 - to go backwards
22:12 - 10 layers because these are going to be
22:13 - more these aren't sprites these are
22:15 - going to be more of a backdrop
22:16 - so when i receive my new message i'm
22:18 - going to go backwards and then
22:20 - i'm let's go ahead and add a new
22:22 - variable x position 1.
22:24 - so i'm just going to call that xpos1
22:27 - and ypos1
22:31 - so two new variables x position one and
22:35 - y position one easy that's how we're
22:38 - going to tell this guy to start moving
22:45 - okay now let's go ahead and set
22:49 - you guessed it x position one two
22:59 - zero and y possession position one to
23:03 - zero
23:05 - and then let's go ahead and go to x
23:08 - and y and instead of typing anything
23:11 - in let's go ahead and put our variables
23:14 - in there
23:15 - go to x position one y position one
23:20 - perfect and then let's do a forever loop
23:34 - and change x position one
23:38 - by
23:41 - negative ten
23:52 - and next
23:55 - go to x equals
24:00 - x position y equals y position
24:03 - so i've just made it move a little tiny
24:05 - bit
24:11 - then let's add an if then
24:21 - and we'll add a less than operator
24:24 - if x position one is less than
24:29 - negative 480 which is the width of our
24:31 - little screen
24:38 - then what happens so if it's less than
24:40 - our screen
24:42 - then we set x position to our screen
24:45 - 480.
24:48 - it'll make sense in a minute
24:54 - okay so i'm going to take out that
24:56 - broadcast message right now just to try
24:58 - it and i'll put in a green flag
25:00 - so do you see in the upper left hand
25:02 - corner our variables they're going
25:04 - x position is going up to 480 and then
25:07 - down to negative 480 and that's right
25:08 - that's what we want
25:12 - we have to layer it with something and
25:14 - that's where we need that second sprite
25:16 - that second green backdrop sprite
25:18 - so let's go into the first sprite
25:21 - because the second sprite has no code
25:23 - let's go into that first sprite and
25:25 - let's go ahead and drag that code into
25:27 - the second
25:28 - now we're going to change the variables
25:30 - here we're going to make two new
25:32 - variables in that second
25:34 - backdrop x position 2 and y
25:37 - position 2. so let's get rid of that
25:39 - green flag clicked
25:41 - let's go to variables make a variable x
25:44 - position 2
25:45 - and y position 2. so we have four new
25:48 - variables
25:50 - now go ahead and set that x
25:53 - to x position 2 and y position two to
25:56 - zero
25:57 - now let's take out
26:05 - let's go ahead and pull this apart so i
26:07 - can take things out a little better oops
26:13 - let's take out go to x y
26:16 - and let's do
26:19 - go to x position two
26:24 - and y position two
26:42 - okay now change x position two two
26:47 - by negative ten
26:50 - and let's take out those position ones
26:53 - and put in x position two y position two
27:07 - all right if x position 2 is less than
27:10 - negative 480
27:14 - and let's go ahead and leave that as x
27:17 - position one
27:19 - now let's try it out
27:25 - so we need green flag clicked
27:29 - let's go back into that one add green
27:30 - flag clicked
27:32 - and um go ahead and click our green flag
27:34 - perfect it's running
27:36 - all right step 10 let's add a broadcast
27:38 - message
27:43 - all right so we are in our bad guy code
27:48 - and i want to go ahead and say when when
27:51 - he hears the message flowers that's when
27:53 - he's gonna
27:54 - go ahead and do his thing so when i
27:56 - receive new message
27:58 - flowers hit okay
28:03 - that's when his code is going to start
28:05 - running
28:06 - and we're going to make this for anybody
28:08 - that works in the flower shop
28:13 - so when i receive the message flowers
28:18 - i'm going to show myself as the bad guy
28:20 - because that's where i work
28:21 - in the flower shop
28:29 - all right let's go to the beetle
28:40 - and when i receive flowers then my code
28:43 - starts now let's go to
28:45 - our red sprite guy in the flower shop
28:49 - our flower guy
28:51 - and let's take off those when green flag
28:54 - is clicked
28:54 - and when i receive flowers put those on
28:57 - top of our
28:59 - move tools our move code
29:20 - okay so we're in
29:25 - the bad guy sprite now let's go ahead
29:29 - and start making buttons to jump to the
29:33 - three different jobs that you can have
29:36 - okay so you can work at the pizza shop
29:38 - the flower shop or the candy store
29:40 - let's do the pizza shop first so we're
29:41 - gonna make a little button
29:43 - so i've downloaded a little pizza
29:46 - shop sign and i uploaded it as
29:50 - a sprite now let's go ahead and make it
29:54 - look a little bit like a button
29:55 - and we're going to stick it on the home
29:56 - page so
29:58 - our players can click it and say hey i
30:00 - want to work at the pizza shop
30:02 - so i'm going to make it just the right
30:04 - size put it over to the left-hand part
30:06 - of the screen and then in
30:08 - text red text write pizza shop
30:12 - above it and then go ahead and
30:16 - make a box around it in red
30:19 - again so it looks like a button and then
30:21 - we're just going to code it
30:23 - there's the box so that when our players
30:27 - press it they go to a pizza store
30:29 - and they see our little pizza guy and
30:31 - they can play
30:33 - our little pizza bread catch game and
30:34 - win money
30:36 - to play the lotto okay so we're in the
30:39 - pizza shop
30:41 - guy sprite or we're in the pizza shop
30:44 - button sprite
30:45 - when message received we'll go ahead
30:48 - oh when message received flowers we're
30:50 - going to hide that button
30:52 - so hiding different sprites is important
30:55 - in this game because we only want the
30:56 - sprites to show up
30:58 - in their specific jobs so
31:01 - when green flag is clicked we want to
31:05 - show the pizza shop button because it's
31:07 - going to be on the home page
31:09 - and the home page is going to be when we
31:11 - click the green flag
31:13 - and let's add a couple more little
31:16 - simple codes here when this sprite is
31:19 - clicked
31:20 - now let's go ahead step 12 and make a
31:22 - pizza shop background so when that
31:24 - sprite's clicked it goes to this
31:25 - background
31:28 - so when the sprite is clicked let's do a
31:31 - new message
31:32 - that says pizza or pizza store or pizza
31:35 - shop whatever you want
31:39 - and let's upload a picture of the inside
31:42 - of a like a minecraft or a roblox game
31:45 - of a pizza shop
31:49 - so this one that i got is sort of red
31:51 - and black and it has
31:53 - um i don't know if you can see it but it
31:56 - has different
31:57 - a menu on the wall and it has sort of
32:00 - like a kitchen
32:00 - and some benches and it i like it
32:03 - because it's red
32:05 - now go ahead and fill up your entire
32:08 - backdrop with your picture
32:10 - you can have any picture you like you
32:11 - can even just have like a red background
32:13 - here it doesn't have to be a shop
32:14 - background
32:16 - i just like these little images i think
32:17 - it's more fun
32:19 - okay so i make sure that it fills the
32:21 - entire backdrop
32:23 - now i go back to my pizza store sprite
32:27 - and remember this is going to be a
32:29 - button that clicks
32:30 - us and what we're going to say that
32:32 - clicks us into the game
32:33 - into the pizza shop so when so we're
32:37 - going to say when this sprite is clicked
32:38 - go ahead and go to that backdrop now
32:40 - number 13 let's go ahead and make a home
32:43 - button
32:45 - so let's go into the sprites and upload
32:49 - and in the search bar let's type home
32:52 - and there's a little home button right
32:53 - there and
32:56 - let's drag that to the top right of the
32:57 - screen
32:59 - and it's a little big let's make it a
33:01 - little smaller
33:10 - a little bigger and
33:14 - it is always going to be seen because um
33:17 - we're going to allow our players to
33:19 - always go back home
33:21 - so let's go into the code and when this
33:25 - sprite is clicked
33:29 - same thing with the pizza store switch
33:32 - backdrop to
33:33 - home so it's just a blank white screen
33:36 - and there's our pizza shop button
33:39 - awesome so those two things are on our
33:41 - home page
33:43 - when the green flag is clicked we're
33:45 - going to show
33:47 - our home button good
33:55 - okay let's test it out all right let's
33:58 - go back to the
34:00 - flower shop guide
34:03 - and let's add when green flag is clicked
34:06 - we're going to hide
34:07 - our flower shop guide because we don't
34:08 - want to see him until we're actually
34:10 - in working in our flower shop okay so
34:13 - let's go to the bad guy
34:16 - and when green flag is clicked
34:20 - let's hide the bad guy because we don't
34:22 - want to see him until we click
34:24 - into our flower shop
34:27 - oh there's the beetle still in the pizza
34:29 - shop so let's hide him so let's go into
34:31 - the beatles code
34:32 - and when green flag is clicked hide
34:42 - all right so let's test it out go to
34:44 - home go to pizza shop
34:45 - okay back to home
34:49 - okay step 14
34:52 - let's make the flower shop button so
34:54 - same steps
34:56 - as the pizza store but
34:59 - so upload and this i just
35:02 - have a nice little picture of flowers
35:05 - and
35:05 - in purple or pink some type of cute
35:08 - flower color
35:09 - go ahead and add the text flower shop on
35:11 - top of it and then add a box around it
35:13 - so it looks like a little button and
35:16 - then sort of make it the same size
35:18 - now let's make that flower shot button
35:20 - go to the moving
35:21 - background that we clicked or that we
35:24 - created i'm sorry
35:26 - okay so
35:30 - we are in the moving background the
35:32 - first
35:33 - sprite of the moving background when i
35:35 - receive flowers let's go ahead and
35:37 - change that broadcast message to when i
35:39 - receive flowers
35:41 - we show this background good
35:50 - when the backdrop switches to
35:53 - lottery we're gonna hide it so basically
35:57 - we're going to hide it
35:58 - until hide these until they're um we
36:01 - have the flower shop so when backdrop
36:04 - switches to home hide
36:05 - when backdrop switches to pizza shop
36:07 - hide when backdrop switches to
36:09 - candyland hide we don't want to see any
36:12 - of these
36:13 - except in when somebody clicks the
36:15 - flowers when somebody broadcasts flower
36:17 - or goes into the flower shop
36:22 - so i'm just hiding hiding hiding hiding
36:24 - this
36:26 - okay so i go into my second green
36:28 - backdrop
36:29 - which is a skype and i'm just going to
36:32 - go ahead and drag all these little hide
36:34 - codes
36:35 - into the second one as well
36:44 - that's going to be a big part of this
36:45 - game is just hiding the sprites until
36:48 - you go to their store
36:52 - and you can do it a number of different
36:54 - ways
36:57 - you don't have to just do what i'm
36:58 - saying
37:02 - okay i'm going to go ahead and lay these
37:03 - out so i can see them neatly
37:14 - okay let's go ahead and let's now make
37:17 - the
37:17 - candy store button
37:22 - so same thing i got a picture of the
37:24 - outside of a candy store
37:26 - called sweeties candy warehouse it is a
37:29 - real place and it's awesome i've been
37:31 - there
37:32 - in cleveland it is fantastic it has tons
37:35 - and tons of different types of candy
37:36 - that
37:37 - i've never seen before and i've seen a
37:39 - lot of candies
37:40 - okay so i want to shrink this down to be
37:42 - sort of sort of kind of the same size
37:45 - as the other stores now i'm going to go
37:47 - into the fire shop
37:49 - or the fire fire the pizza shop
37:52 - and i'm just gonna go ahead and drag and
37:54 - drop some of this code
37:55 - into my candy store button
37:59 - now let's go ahead and make the candy
38:00 - store backdrop
38:04 - so when we actually click that little
38:06 - candy store button
38:08 - where do we go well i grabbed this fun
38:11 - little
38:11 - um minecraft type roblox type
38:15 - background it's just tons of different
38:17 - colors it reminds me of candy
38:20 - so i went ahead and made that as a
38:22 - backdrop
38:23 - called candyland and i'm going to go
38:26 - ahead and just resize it and fill it all
38:28 - the way up so it takes up the entire
38:30 - screen of candy candyland
38:43 - okay now let's go back to the candy
38:46 - store button that we just created
38:48 - and say when we receive when this spread
38:52 - is clicked broadcast candyland which is
38:54 - a new broadcast
38:55 - and then go to the backdrop of candyland
38:58 - now let's go into the bad guy and let's
39:01 - hide him
39:03 - from candyland and basically anything
39:05 - else that he
39:06 - that is not the flower shop so he
39:09 - shouldn't be seen in the lottery the
39:11 - pizza store
39:11 - the candy land all he should be seen is
39:14 - in the flower
39:15 - all right so step 18 let's make the
39:17 - candy store
39:19 - code um so let's go into
39:23 - or let's make the candy store guy so i
39:26 - the easiest thing to do is just
39:27 - duplicate
39:28 - the flower store guy and then change his
39:31 - colors
39:32 - so there's our flower shop guy in red
39:34 - now we're going to change him to
39:37 - wearing all purple and having a yellow
39:39 - hair and beard
39:41 - and sometimes i have to redraw the beard
39:43 - and the hair a little bit because i get
39:45 - too
39:45 - happy with the colors okay looking good
39:48 - all right where is this okay i want to
39:50 - color recolor all of these
39:53 - so i pick a nice purple
39:57 - and then i use my eyedropper i can pick
39:59 - that yellow and just recolor his beard
40:02 - and his hair
40:04 - then use the eyedropper and grab that
40:06 - same purple and recolor
40:08 - and recolor his beard and his hair no
40:10 - problem
40:14 - and i like to do this because i like to
40:15 - color
40:18 - and again sometimes i have to redraw the
40:20 - outline a little bit
40:23 - but it does not take long and then that
40:25 - way i have everybody looking the same
40:27 - that's why i like to use the same
40:29 - sprites
40:32 - and i like to use the same code
40:36 - all right step 19 code the candy store
40:39 - guy
40:41 - so he's gonna have the exact same code
40:43 - as the flower shop guy
40:45 - so let's make sure he's running right
40:47 - right right
40:49 - now he's running left left left left
40:52 - left left
40:55 - awesome now let's go into his code
41:01 - and make sure that his costumes are all
41:04 - correct
41:05 - so they say purple right and purple left
41:12 - just check all of his codes now when we
41:15 - receive the broadcast message candyland
41:17 - not flowers
41:18 - because we're now in the candy store and
41:21 - make sure that his run codes are correct
41:23 - now when again switch the bat the
41:25 - broadcast message on this
41:27 - and then when he's touching we haven't
41:30 - made
41:31 - anything for him to um use
41:34 - as his earning money in his store
41:38 - so i'm just going to leave some of these
41:41 - just as placeholders
41:45 - but we're going to end up changing them
41:46 - so it's changed by two and negative two
41:49 - we can change that now and let's just
41:52 - get rid of those says
41:56 - all right so our purple guy our purple
41:57 - sprite um
41:59 - is working really nicely for having
42:02 - spent just like a couple minutes on him
42:04 - and that's why it's awesome to duplicate
42:07 - all right so duplicate that
42:09 - when i receive so instead of flowers
42:11 - when i receive pizza store i hide
42:15 - because he does not belong in the pizza
42:17 - store
42:19 - okay there he is
42:23 - there he is running up left
42:27 - down terrific all right
42:30 - step 20. let's go ahead and code um some
42:33 - candy hearts
42:34 - to make this more into a job for him
42:38 - so let's go ahead and go to choose a
42:42 - sprite
42:44 - and in the search bar let's type
42:49 - candy and there's our heart candy
42:52 - and then let's go ahead and go into the
42:54 - costume because i need to change this
42:56 - costume
42:58 - so instead of it just saying
43:01 - code it and and being in these light
43:04 - colors
43:05 - i want to change them to my own colors
43:07 - that i like better and i'm going to get
43:08 - rid of that coated
43:10 - so i made the heart smaller so it's
43:12 - easier so it's harder to grab
43:14 - we don't want the job to be too easy
43:18 - and let's just go ahead and delete the
43:20 - rest of these other hearts
43:22 - they're too big now um let's go ahead
43:25 - and duplicate
43:26 - this candy heart and give it a different
43:29 - color just to make the game a little bit
43:31 - more of our own
43:32 - that color is fine i like to keep these
43:35 - colors nice and light
43:39 - and let's get like maybe a little purple
43:43 - and then duplicate the purple heart
43:48 - maybe a little pink
43:53 - okay um now let's go ahead and add some
43:57 - code to our hearts
44:01 - so when green flag is clicked we're
44:03 - going to hide
44:04 - because we're only going to show the
44:06 - hearts when we receive
44:08 - the candyland message or we're in the
44:10 - candy shop
44:12 - okay so when we receive candyland
44:16 - message we show our hearts
44:20 - candy hearts let's duplicate
44:24 - when we receive the flower message we
44:26 - hide
44:27 - and i'll just go through those other
44:29 - hides now when we receive candyland
44:33 - let's do a forever loop and wait 0.2
44:35 - seconds
44:41 - then we'll switch costumes so he's
44:42 - always turning different costume colors
44:45 - now let's make him move a little bit and
44:48 - let's wait point another point
44:50 - two seconds
44:55 - and then we'll make him move jump to
44:56 - random position
44:58 - okey dokey and that's just like the
45:01 - bread
45:02 - so let's click um candy store the sprite
45:06 - takes us to this cool background
45:09 - the heart is working awesome all right
45:12 - let's go
45:12 - back
45:17 - into our candy store guy and let's do a
45:20 - couple of things here
45:21 - let's start him off in a position to the
45:24 - bottom left
45:25 - so whatever coordinates you have on the
45:27 - bottom left let's go ahead and start the
45:28 - game there
45:30 - so i'm going to put under when i receive
45:32 - candyland show and then go to
45:34 - x at those coordinates
45:39 - 180 and minus 100. now
45:43 - let's go ahead and change this in our
45:45 - when i receive candyland
45:46 - in my forever loop if i'm touching
45:51 - the heart candy then make money goes up
45:54 - by two
46:01 - okay now let's go ahead and duplicate
46:03 - that um pink heart
46:04 - those those little cute hearts and let's
46:07 - go into the costume this is gonna be the
46:09 - let's turn this into the bad guy
46:10 - of the candyland store all right so
46:12 - let's get rid of the all but one
46:15 - costume of the heart
46:18 - and we're gonna call this a bad heart
46:21 - it's a bad candy let's turn it a rotten
46:25 - color candy
46:26 - dark and maybe like a dark red
46:29 - okay so this heart has some this bad
46:32 - heart has some code already with it
46:35 - so let's speed it up instead of point
46:37 - two let's make it point one
46:40 - go to candy store now it's flipping all
46:42 - over the place okay good there it is
46:46 - all over okay now let's go back into the
46:48 - candy store guy
46:50 - code and when we touch that bad heart
46:52 - let's do minus two
46:56 - now let's play a little bit see if i can
46:58 - make this score
47:00 - go up and down
47:08 - seems to be working good good good
47:12 - okay now let's do um a little bit of a
47:15 - say
47:16 - on each of these so
47:19 - when we touch the bad candy heart let's
47:21 - say oh no for two seconds
47:25 - and we touch the good candy heart let's
47:27 - say
47:30 - yummy for two seconds okay let's try it
47:33 - out yummy
47:34 - yummy oh no
47:38 - all right step 21 let's make the pizza
47:40 - shop guy so the
47:41 - we're doing the exact same thing with
47:43 - the
47:44 - pizza shop guy that we did with the
47:46 - candy store so let's just duplicate that
47:47 - candy store guy
47:49 - go ahead and rename him pizza shop guy
47:51 - now
47:52 - go ahead and color him differently
47:56 - i did brown hair and a yellow suit
48:02 - and i make all my rights and then i make
48:05 - all my lefts
48:06 - and i make sure that they're grouped
48:07 - together
48:09 - it's just easier to code them that way
48:16 - okay and i'm just using my eyedropper
48:18 - tool so i get the colors
48:20 - exactly the same from costume to costume
48:23 - just so he looks as good as he can
48:32 - good and i love the coloring process
48:36 - it's super easy super fun and then that
48:38 - way they all look
48:39 - exactly the same
48:59 - almost done
49:04 - okay and we only have a couple more
49:06 - things to do in this game before it's
49:08 - done
49:09 - okay let's keep coloring and there's the
49:12 - brown
49:13 - and brown and one more guy to go brown
49:16 - yellow whoops yellow okay
49:20 - awesome all right let's code the pizza
49:23 - shop guy so we just have to make a
49:24 - couple of changes
49:26 - and then his code will be good
49:30 - so when we receive pizza shop
49:33 - we're going to show
49:36 - good and if you haven't made the pizza
49:38 - shop broadcast message just go ahead and
49:40 - make it
49:41 - and then we show when we have the
49:44 - backdrop to pizza shop
49:46 - and we hide it when it's green flag
49:48 - click and we hide it when it flowers and
49:50 - we hide it when it's candyland and we
49:52 - hide him when
49:54 - we're in the home backdrop so there's
49:57 - all kinds of hiding to do
49:59 - with these candy store
50:02 - all right make sure his costumes are
50:04 - correct
50:06 - which they all should be because the
50:08 - candy store was cracked so the flower
50:10 - so that this guy copied it so he should
50:12 - be correct all right go ahead and change
50:14 - that broadcast message to pizza store
50:17 - and broadcast message to pizza store now
50:19 - what we're gonna do is
50:21 - instead of touching candy heart or heart
50:23 - candy we're gonna get rid of that
50:25 - because we're gonna be doing some bread
50:27 - so these can just be placeholders for a
50:29 - minute we're gonna change this by one
50:32 - and negative one because the pizza shop
50:35 - should be the easiest
50:36 - because the bread isn't super small
50:46 - all right so let's go ahead and make the
50:47 - pizza shop breads and then we'll finish
50:49 - the rest of the coat on the pizza shop
50:51 - guy
50:53 - so go into choose a sprite
50:57 - and then in the search bar type in bread
51:02 - and there's a little loaf of bread
51:06 - fabulous
51:08 - and that's just the right size you can
51:10 - adjust the size if you want okay when we
51:12 - receive the pizza shop
51:13 - broadcast message then what do we do
51:17 - then we do our forever loop
51:25 - then we do wait 0.2 seconds
51:34 - and next costume although i'm not sure
51:35 - i'm gonna do another costume for bread
51:38 - i might just leave that one costume but
51:41 - maybe you can do a different costume and
51:42 - flip it around
51:43 - okay and wait point two seconds and then
51:45 - go to random position
51:51 - all right let's go to home go to pizza
51:53 - shop and there's the bread and it's
51:54 - flipping all over the place
51:56 - yay or it's jumping all over the place i
51:58 - should say
51:59 - and there's our pizza shop guy and he
52:01 - can go up and down and right and left
52:04 - fabulous it's working all right let's
52:07 - hit stop
52:11 - now let's go into our black
52:15 - heart for a minute something's showing
52:18 - oh okay
52:18 - let's actually let's drag some of these
52:21 - um
52:23 - show and hides into our bread
52:28 - because we're gonna need the same things
52:30 - in our bread we only want the bread
52:32 - to be seen inside the pizza shop that
52:34 - makes sense
52:35 - right
52:42 - let me rearrange this code nicer and
52:44 - let's go ahead and
52:46 - do some duplicates of this so
52:49 - when i receive pizza shop i show
52:53 - my bread
53:01 - duplicate
53:05 - when i receive candy store
53:12 - i don't want my bread to show in the
53:14 - candy store
53:17 - okay it doesn't look like it's there
53:18 - good
53:23 - all right let's go back into the candy
53:25 - store the pizza shop guy
53:27 - so let's go ahead and adjust this so if
53:31 - i
53:32 - receive my pizza shop broadcast message
53:35 - forever
53:36 - i'm in a loop if i touch the bread
53:41 - then my money goes up by one
53:44 - and i wait 0.1 seconds
53:53 - okay and i'm also going to go to say
53:59 - yes
54:07 - and i'll duplicate that red
54:10 - and go into costume and this is i'm
54:12 - going to make a green bread because this
54:14 - is the yucky bread you don't want to
54:15 - touch this bread
54:16 - so let's make that green all over
54:27 - and let's wait point one second and
54:30 - point one second
54:31 - in our green bread and let's
54:34 - get rid of that next costume and let's
54:38 - just
54:38 - so it's just gonna wait point one second
54:39 - then it's just gonna go to random
54:40 - position all over
54:42 - and we're gonna say yes when we catch
54:44 - the brown bread
54:52 - and then when we touch the green bread
54:55 - or the bad bread whatever we want to
54:57 - call it
55:01 - let's call it bad bread
55:15 - then it's gonna be minus one all right
55:16 - step 24 let's make the play the lotto
55:19 - button
55:20 - so this is our fourth button that we're
55:21 - making
55:23 - so let's go into paint
55:26 - in our backdrop and let's just make a
55:30 - plain white background that says lottery
55:33 - now let's go into choose a sprite and
55:36 - let's
55:36 - i typed in the the um description
55:40 - button and i got this little green
55:41 - button and i just added the text play
55:43 - the lotto
55:44 - now for the code let's go into
55:48 - when
55:51 - we receive lotto
55:56 - show actually when we receive home
55:59 - show and then when this sprite is
56:01 - clicked
56:06 - switch back drop to lottery perfect
56:15 - and then let's go ahead and add when
56:17 - green flag is clicked
56:24 - show because we always want the lotto
56:26 - button to show it's sort of like the
56:27 - home button
56:28 - step 25 make the click me button to
56:32 - lay the lotto yay okay this is that big
56:35 - rectangle that i made
56:36 - that you might have seen earlier so we
56:39 - want sort of a light
56:41 - yellow and a light green rectangle one
56:43 - inside the other
56:45 - so there's rectangle one
56:49 - there's rectangle two and i'll just put
56:50 - that to the background
56:52 - and then let's go ahead and type click
56:56 - me
56:58 - let's make it a little bit bigger and
57:01 - then let's go ahead and type
57:03 - one dollar scratch off ticket
57:08 - one in ten chances
57:12 - winning
57:17 - you don't have to do one in ten you can
57:19 - do one in 20 you can do one in 100
57:21 - you can do one in five all right let's
57:24 - create some new variables so new
57:25 - variable name
57:26 - winning number
57:30 - and this is inside that click me sprite
57:32 - that we just made
57:34 - and new variable name your
57:37 - number guess
57:41 - and we don't have to leave those out
57:42 - there we can for now okay so broadcast
57:44 - new message
57:48 - number
57:52 - and let's make another broadcast message
57:55 - new
57:58 - message one message i won
58:02 - and then let's duplicate that and this
58:04 - can be a message lost
58:05 - or message i lost message i lost
58:12 - okay so number i want i lost three
58:14 - different new broadcast messages
58:16 - all right let's create a new backdrop
58:17 - that says one
58:20 - and let's just make this green do you
58:21 - remember this from the beginning of the
58:23 - video a big green backdrop
58:27 - and we're going to add some text just to
58:29 - let the people know that they won the
58:30 - lotto they guessed the correct number
58:32 - from one to ten
58:34 - all right so at the bottom let's put
58:36 - some text in black
58:37 - we're almost done congratulations
58:44 - you won click me
58:48 - to play again
58:55 - awesome okay and let's duplicate that
58:58 - background
58:59 - that backdrop and let's make it red
59:02 - except let's not go ahead and say
59:04 - congratulations because this is what
59:06 - they get when they lost
59:07 - so instead of congratulations we're
59:09 - gonna put sorry
59:14 - you lost click me to play again
59:17 - because they can certainly play again
59:20 - and move that over a little bit now in
59:22 - the click me
59:23 - um code we have our new broadcast
59:26 - messages we have some hides
59:28 - and we have a show
59:32 - so when this sprite is clicked if
59:36 - make money is
59:39 - less than zero
59:44 - or is less than one and it can be equal
59:46 - to zero or less than zero two
59:48 - there's a lot of different ways you can
59:49 - do this say
59:55 - you must make money to play the lotto
60:12 - elves choose
60:14 - a number from one to ten
60:18 - between one and ten that's better
60:21 - between i like that better
60:24 - so when this sprite is clicked if your
60:26 - money is less than one you can't play
60:29 - else you're telling the person to choose
60:32 - a number between one and ten
60:34 - then you're gonna say
60:42 - join i bet you know what we're going to
60:44 - do
60:46 - answer
60:50 - bye this is your guess
60:53 - you can leave a little blank too so it's
60:54 - not out crowded is
60:56 - your guess so if i type two it will say
60:59 - my answer is your guess for two seconds
61:03 - it's just a little makes it more
61:04 - interactive so that people know that
61:06 - something's happening
61:08 - okay then we set
61:17 - your number guess two
61:20 - you guessed it the answer
61:29 - and something's gonna happen if it's
61:30 - right or wrong
61:34 - it's so simple then broadcast number
61:38 - the message or new message
61:41 - number we already did that one so
61:45 - broadcast number
61:46 - we're not going to do too much with the
61:47 - broadcast number right here but you
61:48 - could do like a high score
61:51 - set winning number
61:55 - so it's good to have that in there two
62:01 - pick random one to ten so that's where
62:03 - the code is picking a number for us
62:10 - and then pick an if-then-else statement
62:23 - if winning number
62:28 - equals
62:32 - your number guess then
62:36 - change
62:39 - make money by one
62:42 - yay and if not change winning number by
62:46 - negative one
62:49 - and also let's go ahead and add in there
62:53 - our broadcast message i won
62:56 - and then a broadcast message i lost
63:00 - super simple
63:04 - now what happens when you win and lose
63:07 - so if the broadcast message says i lost
63:11 - then i want to switch backdrops to the
63:13 - lost backdrop which is that red one
63:17 - and then if the winning if the um
63:20 - message
63:20 - says i won
63:26 - then i want to switch the backdrop to
63:28 - one which is the green backdrop
63:33 - i just have one one nothing and one two
63:36 - i didn't switch the names okay so let's
63:39 - try it out
63:41 - click me pick a number between one and
63:44 - ten
63:44 - and i chose it and i lost all right
63:48 - awesome almost done step 26 let's make
63:51 - some background music i suggest
63:53 - different background music
63:54 - for every store so all you do go to
63:58 - freesounds.org
63:59 - download some music
64:02 - then go into your store
64:06 - so i'm in my flower shop and i go to
64:10 - sounds upload a sound
64:23 - and it's importing and let's i always
64:26 - rename it
64:27 - because it comes out with this crazy
64:29 - sound so flower shop
64:31 - background music or background
64:36 - and then we just have to code it
64:44 - okay that sounds good you guys can't
64:46 - hear it but it sounds good on my end
64:49 - now when i receive the message flowers
64:56 - forever
65:02 - play my song
65:05 - okay so let's test it out go to my
65:06 - flower store got you
65:12 - good and there's my lotto button there's
65:13 - my make money there's my home button
65:15 - awesome and my score is changing
65:18 - terrific
65:20 - got you got you
65:24 - all right step 27 this is our last step
65:27 - less than a minute to go
65:29 - let's make some directions on our
65:30 - homepage
65:32 - so go to our home page and write
65:36 - where would you like to
65:39 - work question mark pizza shop easiest
65:42 - one dollar
65:44 - per bread candy store harder
65:47 - two dollars per candy heart flower store
65:51 - hardest three dollars per bug
65:55 - you're done congratulations all right
65:58 - let's go ahead and
65:59 - show that text just on the home page and
66:03 - hide it everywhere else
66:06 - and you know how to do this because
66:08 - you've done this with all the different
66:09 - sprites
66:12 - it's just a game

Cleaned transcript:

hi let's make a roblox type game in scratch this tutorial is not for beginners the objective of this game is easy to make money and play the lotto the lotto is super easy just click the click me button and guess a number from 1 to 10. if you lose a red screen appears and your make money account goes down by one point if you win a green screen appears and you gain a point but to play the lotto you must first make money now in this tutorial you can learn about the three different jobs and about how we play the lotto step one let's create three different jobs with three different sprites there's the pizza shop guy or gal he chases brown bread avoiding green bread and his job is the easiest so he only earns one point for every single piece of bread he catches all right the candy store guy or gal he chases little colored hearts and avoids the dark hearts super simple there he is in that fun little background he goes up down all around and he gets two points for everything that he catches the flower shop guy this is the hardest level watch out for the bad guy there is a bad guy in this uh job and he is coming after you with his ray gun and um the flower shop guy actually tries to catch the little beetle and he wins three points when he does all right step two let's go ahead and upload three different colored strips of running sprites and then in step three we're going to make each sprite into its own costume so let's go ahead and unpack that so there are my six um little flower shop guys and they are all in a state of running so i uploaded the entire strip of them and now i'm just gonna go ahead and put each of them in their own different costume and then i'm going to go ahead and label them run right one through six so i'm just duplicating and copying pasting here so they're all in their own little costume so there's run right one two three four five and six and then we're going to add some code so it looks as if they are running okay now let's go ahead and duplicate them and turn them flip them horizontal and turn them to the left and then label them run left one through six easy easy easy and with these stripes or these uh sprites we are going to be able to run not only right and left but also up and down go ahead and place the all the rights together and all the lefts together all right step four let's code the sprites to run let's stay with our red flower guy so we're gonna code them to run up down left and right and it's actually really simple we're going to use blocks so first let's go ahead and code run left alright so choose make a block and let's call it run left now let's go ahead and choose switch costume to run left one then change x by negative 10 because we're running to the left side of our screen then we're gonna do uh weight point zero one seconds then let's go ahead and add next costume now let's click that run block oops can you see my mistake instead of run left i have run right so let's go ahead and switch that and now he looks right yay or left there he goes now let's go ahead and add a key here our left key so when we type it on the keyboard he actually runs to the left so i dragged out my when green flag is clicked then a forever loop then an if then and key when left arrow is pressed drag in our run left block and let's add a couple more things set point direction in can you guess it negative 90. so he points to the left and let's set his rotation style for don't rotate so he doesn't flip over and let's try it out okay looks pretty good all right now let's run right so my block let's name it run right and click ok now let's go ahead and repeat here so switch costume to run right one and change x by 10. let's grab a weight 0.01 seconds and then let's add a next costume okay if we click that run right block he'll go ahead and he'll move and he'll run to the right perfect now let's add in our forever loop the same blocks and let's just duplicate that left arrow and then change some of the parameters so if when the key right arrow is pressed let's get rid of these guys so we don't need that run block run left we don't need that let's go ahead and grab our run right block and then instead of point in direction instead of point in direction negative 90 we plane in direction 90 and then let's leave that don't rotate and make sure that that block is right underneath it forever okay so there is our running left and our running right perfect easy all right now let's run up and run down so go ahead and click make a block hit okay and run up and hit okay again now you know the drill switch costume and this is going to be left so run left they're all left except the right so left up and down are all left costumes all right change y by 10 because we're running up which is in positive territory wait .01 seconds again and then go ahead and grab that switch costume perfect now let's test it out we can just go ahead and click let's go ahead and duplicate that left arrow and choose the up arrow key get rid of those blocks underneath choose the run up block perfect point in direction can you guess the direction we're going to point in 180 and let's set a rotation style of all around now i think that there are different parameters that we can use i'm wondering if any of you know how to run up and not use those so just let me know in the comments okay so our run up is working left right up can't go any further up awesome i like how he drags his leg okay let's go ahead and make down so make a block call it run down hit okay let's go ahead and switch costume two left and then change by negative 10 good and then let's add our weight 0.01 seconds and then let's add our next costume okay let's go ahead and duplicate that up let's make it a down take out that run up block put in our run or our um run down block and then point direction can you guess what this is going to be zero yay if you guessed zero great job and leave that rotation style okay let's see if he can run down yay he's running down he's running up left right up down left up awesome all right step five let's go ahead and create the make money variable without money we can't do anything this is super easy just go into variables click make a variable and for the new variable name go ahead and type make money and then you can add a dollar sign or two and hit okay all right step six let's upload the bad guy that lives in the flower shop this is the only store with a bad guy he has a deadly ray gun so i drew this little character with a top hat and a funny little gun and there are six of him seven of him and seven and each in a different position and so the same thing with the flower shop guy we're gonna do with the bad guy which is give him um his own costume and so the first picture of him he's just sort of holding his ray gun and the last picture of him there's just a puff of smoke so in like the fifth and sixth the puffs of smoke get bigger so it gives the illusion um that he is shooting this crazy i don't know this crazy gas gun or something so i'm just duplicating and then i copy and paste and each picture is a little bit different so when we go ahead and code him it's going to give the illusion of an animation of him actually moving and his gun going off now i can take that white off just by using my fill transparent and i put him right in the middle of the screen almost done okay perfect now make sure that you label all of them bad guy right one through seven and then let's go ahead and make you guessed it we're gonna duplicate these and make him run to the left as well all right let's say we're done with that now let's step seven code the bad guy so we're in the bad guy and when green flag is clicked let's go x to 221 and y to negative 129. so we're going to be moving the bad guy from right to left across the screen and then he's gonna jump into a random position now let's add a glide one second to x same numbers two two one and negative one two nine now let's pull in that forever loop and let's go ahead and add a weight point one second we're going to make him a little faster than the red guy and you can adjust this however you'd like and make it your own game and then we go ahead and put in next costume so he looks as if he is really running and shooting his ray gun now we're going to do change y by you guessed it negative 5 and you can do negative 10 you can do negative 7 if you want him to move faster this way he really looks um at negative 5. you can really see each pose that we've drawn all right let's add a if then statement if x position is less than 170 negative 170 then go to random position awesome so when you get to the end of the screen then jump set x to 180 and let's try it out there he goes step eight let's go ahead and upload the beetle in the flower shop remember this is the objective of the flower shop guy is to catch the beetle and get three points stay away from the bad guy if the bad guy touches them it's minus three points so i went into my upload a sprite i'm gonna go ahead in the search bar and type beetle there's the beetle let's go ahead and first thing let's make him a little smaller he's a little too easy to catch that size so i go ahead and i draw a box around his entire body and just drag him to a smaller size okay perfect let's add some code when green flag is clicked show him and then in a forever loop weight point did i do 0.2 seconds yes 0.2 seconds and then hit the next costume we're going to make a couple more costumes for him and then wait 0.2 seconds again and then go to random position so he should be jumping all over the place right now let's make him look a little bit more like a real bug by um having him jump and move in a different spot so he actually does look like he's jumping so he's not always just facing to the right hand side so let's go ahead and duplicate this beetle so there's four different beetles and each of them should be facing a different way and you can use the flip horizontal foot vertical i just wanted to rotate because rotating is fun okay let's try it out hit the green flag okay now he looks more beatily because he's actually just sort of like jumping all over and moving and it sort of looks cute okay let's go back to the red flower guy code and i added when green flag is clicked for everloop let's go ahead and start adding um some things to make this into like a real game so inside the forever loop let's do if then statement so if i am touching the bad guy what happens then say ouch and let's do something with our money let's go ahead and change make money by negative three because it's a penalty we don't want to get hit by the naughty bad guy with his ray gun okay wait 0.1 second then let's go ahead and add an if then and let's do the same thing for the beetle except let's say got you and let's add three points and then we'll wait point one again so it's the exact same code for each the beetle and the bad guy and it's going to be the same thing in all of the different jobs we're going to say something we're going to have a negative and positive and we're going to have a little bit of a wait time so this is actually i'm trying to catch the beetle right now it's actually pretty hard okay i've seen my first mistake i don't like that when i hit the um beetle it just keeps saying got you so let's go ahead and change that so instead of it just saying it let's do a say for two seconds all right so let's get rid of the regular stay and we'll just have a say for two seconds so got you for two seconds and plus three and then wait point zero one second and let's go ahead and do the same thing for the um bad guy if the bad guy touches me i'm gonna say ouch for two seconds i'm gonna get a minus three on in my money and then we're gonna do a little weight on there too okay this is actually really hard to catch him got you yay he's too fast okay step nine let's go ahead and add a really fun moving background for our flower shop just to make things a little bit more interesting when we work at the flower shop so i um downloaded these two or this one um green block minecraft type back drop and i want to go ahead and upload it into a sprite so it's not a backdrop it's in a sprite so sprite sprite sprite there is my little green it's gonna be a backdrop but it's in a sprite um i duplicated it so i have two and they're gonna layer over each other and constantly move it's gonna be super cool let's make it's gonna make the flower shop an interesting place to work all right so let's go ahead and add a broadcast message the broadcast message is going to be flowers we're going to have one for every single job so if i receive flowers then i'm going to go backwards 10 layers because these are going to be more these aren't sprites these are going to be more of a backdrop so when i receive my new message i'm going to go backwards and then i'm let's go ahead and add a new variable x position 1. so i'm just going to call that xpos1 and ypos1 so two new variables x position one and y position one easy that's how we're going to tell this guy to start moving okay now let's go ahead and set you guessed it x position one two zero and y possession position one to zero and then let's go ahead and go to x and y and instead of typing anything in let's go ahead and put our variables in there go to x position one y position one perfect and then let's do a forever loop and change x position one by negative ten and next go to x equals x position y equals y position so i've just made it move a little tiny bit then let's add an if then and we'll add a less than operator if x position one is less than negative 480 which is the width of our little screen then what happens so if it's less than our screen then we set x position to our screen 480. it'll make sense in a minute okay so i'm going to take out that broadcast message right now just to try it and i'll put in a green flag so do you see in the upper left hand corner our variables they're going x position is going up to 480 and then down to negative 480 and that's right that's what we want we have to layer it with something and that's where we need that second sprite that second green backdrop sprite so let's go into the first sprite because the second sprite has no code let's go into that first sprite and let's go ahead and drag that code into the second now we're going to change the variables here we're going to make two new variables in that second backdrop x position 2 and y position 2. so let's get rid of that green flag clicked let's go to variables make a variable x position 2 and y position 2. so we have four new variables now go ahead and set that x to x position 2 and y position two to zero now let's take out let's go ahead and pull this apart so i can take things out a little better oops let's take out go to x y and let's do go to x position two and y position two okay now change x position two two by negative ten and let's take out those position ones and put in x position two y position two all right if x position 2 is less than negative 480 and let's go ahead and leave that as x position one now let's try it out so we need green flag clicked let's go back into that one add green flag clicked and um go ahead and click our green flag perfect it's running all right step 10 let's add a broadcast message all right so we are in our bad guy code and i want to go ahead and say when when he hears the message flowers that's when he's gonna go ahead and do his thing so when i receive new message flowers hit okay that's when his code is going to start running and we're going to make this for anybody that works in the flower shop so when i receive the message flowers i'm going to show myself as the bad guy because that's where i work in the flower shop all right let's go to the beetle and when i receive flowers then my code starts now let's go to our red sprite guy in the flower shop our flower guy and let's take off those when green flag is clicked and when i receive flowers put those on top of our move tools our move code okay so we're in the bad guy sprite now let's go ahead and start making buttons to jump to the three different jobs that you can have okay so you can work at the pizza shop the flower shop or the candy store let's do the pizza shop first so we're gonna make a little button so i've downloaded a little pizza shop sign and i uploaded it as a sprite now let's go ahead and make it look a little bit like a button and we're going to stick it on the home page so our players can click it and say hey i want to work at the pizza shop so i'm going to make it just the right size put it over to the lefthand part of the screen and then in text red text write pizza shop above it and then go ahead and make a box around it in red again so it looks like a button and then we're just going to code it there's the box so that when our players press it they go to a pizza store and they see our little pizza guy and they can play our little pizza bread catch game and win money to play the lotto okay so we're in the pizza shop guy sprite or we're in the pizza shop button sprite when message received we'll go ahead oh when message received flowers we're going to hide that button so hiding different sprites is important in this game because we only want the sprites to show up in their specific jobs so when green flag is clicked we want to show the pizza shop button because it's going to be on the home page and the home page is going to be when we click the green flag and let's add a couple more little simple codes here when this sprite is clicked now let's go ahead step 12 and make a pizza shop background so when that sprite's clicked it goes to this background so when the sprite is clicked let's do a new message that says pizza or pizza store or pizza shop whatever you want and let's upload a picture of the inside of a like a minecraft or a roblox game of a pizza shop so this one that i got is sort of red and black and it has um i don't know if you can see it but it has different a menu on the wall and it has sort of like a kitchen and some benches and it i like it because it's red now go ahead and fill up your entire backdrop with your picture you can have any picture you like you can even just have like a red background here it doesn't have to be a shop background i just like these little images i think it's more fun okay so i make sure that it fills the entire backdrop now i go back to my pizza store sprite and remember this is going to be a button that clicks us and what we're going to say that clicks us into the game into the pizza shop so when so we're going to say when this sprite is clicked go ahead and go to that backdrop now number 13 let's go ahead and make a home button so let's go into the sprites and upload and in the search bar let's type home and there's a little home button right there and let's drag that to the top right of the screen and it's a little big let's make it a little smaller a little bigger and it is always going to be seen because um we're going to allow our players to always go back home so let's go into the code and when this sprite is clicked same thing with the pizza store switch backdrop to home so it's just a blank white screen and there's our pizza shop button awesome so those two things are on our home page when the green flag is clicked we're going to show our home button good okay let's test it out all right let's go back to the flower shop guide and let's add when green flag is clicked we're going to hide our flower shop guide because we don't want to see him until we're actually in working in our flower shop okay so let's go to the bad guy and when green flag is clicked let's hide the bad guy because we don't want to see him until we click into our flower shop oh there's the beetle still in the pizza shop so let's hide him so let's go into the beatles code and when green flag is clicked hide all right so let's test it out go to home go to pizza shop okay back to home okay step 14 let's make the flower shop button so same steps as the pizza store but so upload and this i just have a nice little picture of flowers and in purple or pink some type of cute flower color go ahead and add the text flower shop on top of it and then add a box around it so it looks like a little button and then sort of make it the same size now let's make that flower shot button go to the moving background that we clicked or that we created i'm sorry okay so we are in the moving background the first sprite of the moving background when i receive flowers let's go ahead and change that broadcast message to when i receive flowers we show this background good when the backdrop switches to lottery we're gonna hide it so basically we're going to hide it until hide these until they're um we have the flower shop so when backdrop switches to home hide when backdrop switches to pizza shop hide when backdrop switches to candyland hide we don't want to see any of these except in when somebody clicks the flowers when somebody broadcasts flower or goes into the flower shop so i'm just hiding hiding hiding hiding this okay so i go into my second green backdrop which is a skype and i'm just going to go ahead and drag all these little hide codes into the second one as well that's going to be a big part of this game is just hiding the sprites until you go to their store and you can do it a number of different ways you don't have to just do what i'm saying okay i'm going to go ahead and lay these out so i can see them neatly okay let's go ahead and let's now make the candy store button so same thing i got a picture of the outside of a candy store called sweeties candy warehouse it is a real place and it's awesome i've been there in cleveland it is fantastic it has tons and tons of different types of candy that i've never seen before and i've seen a lot of candies okay so i want to shrink this down to be sort of sort of kind of the same size as the other stores now i'm going to go into the fire shop or the fire fire the pizza shop and i'm just gonna go ahead and drag and drop some of this code into my candy store button now let's go ahead and make the candy store backdrop so when we actually click that little candy store button where do we go well i grabbed this fun little um minecraft type roblox type background it's just tons of different colors it reminds me of candy so i went ahead and made that as a backdrop called candyland and i'm going to go ahead and just resize it and fill it all the way up so it takes up the entire screen of candy candyland okay now let's go back to the candy store button that we just created and say when we receive when this spread is clicked broadcast candyland which is a new broadcast and then go to the backdrop of candyland now let's go into the bad guy and let's hide him from candyland and basically anything else that he that is not the flower shop so he shouldn't be seen in the lottery the pizza store the candy land all he should be seen is in the flower all right so step 18 let's make the candy store code um so let's go into or let's make the candy store guy so i the easiest thing to do is just duplicate the flower store guy and then change his colors so there's our flower shop guy in red now we're going to change him to wearing all purple and having a yellow hair and beard and sometimes i have to redraw the beard and the hair a little bit because i get too happy with the colors okay looking good all right where is this okay i want to color recolor all of these so i pick a nice purple and then i use my eyedropper i can pick that yellow and just recolor his beard and his hair then use the eyedropper and grab that same purple and recolor and recolor his beard and his hair no problem and i like to do this because i like to color and again sometimes i have to redraw the outline a little bit but it does not take long and then that way i have everybody looking the same that's why i like to use the same sprites and i like to use the same code all right step 19 code the candy store guy so he's gonna have the exact same code as the flower shop guy so let's make sure he's running right right right now he's running left left left left left left awesome now let's go into his code and make sure that his costumes are all correct so they say purple right and purple left just check all of his codes now when we receive the broadcast message candyland not flowers because we're now in the candy store and make sure that his run codes are correct now when again switch the bat the broadcast message on this and then when he's touching we haven't made anything for him to um use as his earning money in his store so i'm just going to leave some of these just as placeholders but we're going to end up changing them so it's changed by two and negative two we can change that now and let's just get rid of those says all right so our purple guy our purple sprite um is working really nicely for having spent just like a couple minutes on him and that's why it's awesome to duplicate all right so duplicate that when i receive so instead of flowers when i receive pizza store i hide because he does not belong in the pizza store okay there he is there he is running up left down terrific all right step 20. let's go ahead and code um some candy hearts to make this more into a job for him so let's go ahead and go to choose a sprite and in the search bar let's type candy and there's our heart candy and then let's go ahead and go into the costume because i need to change this costume so instead of it just saying code it and and being in these light colors i want to change them to my own colors that i like better and i'm going to get rid of that coated so i made the heart smaller so it's easier so it's harder to grab we don't want the job to be too easy and let's just go ahead and delete the rest of these other hearts they're too big now um let's go ahead and duplicate this candy heart and give it a different color just to make the game a little bit more of our own that color is fine i like to keep these colors nice and light and let's get like maybe a little purple and then duplicate the purple heart maybe a little pink okay um now let's go ahead and add some code to our hearts so when green flag is clicked we're going to hide because we're only going to show the hearts when we receive the candyland message or we're in the candy shop okay so when we receive candyland message we show our hearts candy hearts let's duplicate when we receive the flower message we hide and i'll just go through those other hides now when we receive candyland let's do a forever loop and wait 0.2 seconds then we'll switch costumes so he's always turning different costume colors now let's make him move a little bit and let's wait point another point two seconds and then we'll make him move jump to random position okey dokey and that's just like the bread so let's click um candy store the sprite takes us to this cool background the heart is working awesome all right let's go back into our candy store guy and let's do a couple of things here let's start him off in a position to the bottom left so whatever coordinates you have on the bottom left let's go ahead and start the game there so i'm going to put under when i receive candyland show and then go to x at those coordinates 180 and minus 100. now let's go ahead and change this in our when i receive candyland in my forever loop if i'm touching the heart candy then make money goes up by two okay now let's go ahead and duplicate that um pink heart those those little cute hearts and let's go into the costume this is gonna be the let's turn this into the bad guy of the candyland store all right so let's get rid of the all but one costume of the heart and we're gonna call this a bad heart it's a bad candy let's turn it a rotten color candy dark and maybe like a dark red okay so this heart has some this bad heart has some code already with it so let's speed it up instead of point two let's make it point one go to candy store now it's flipping all over the place okay good there it is all over okay now let's go back into the candy store guy code and when we touch that bad heart let's do minus two now let's play a little bit see if i can make this score go up and down seems to be working good good good okay now let's do um a little bit of a say on each of these so when we touch the bad candy heart let's say oh no for two seconds and we touch the good candy heart let's say yummy for two seconds okay let's try it out yummy yummy oh no all right step 21 let's make the pizza shop guy so the we're doing the exact same thing with the pizza shop guy that we did with the candy store so let's just duplicate that candy store guy go ahead and rename him pizza shop guy now go ahead and color him differently i did brown hair and a yellow suit and i make all my rights and then i make all my lefts and i make sure that they're grouped together it's just easier to code them that way okay and i'm just using my eyedropper tool so i get the colors exactly the same from costume to costume just so he looks as good as he can good and i love the coloring process it's super easy super fun and then that way they all look exactly the same almost done okay and we only have a couple more things to do in this game before it's done okay let's keep coloring and there's the brown and brown and one more guy to go brown yellow whoops yellow okay awesome all right let's code the pizza shop guy so we just have to make a couple of changes and then his code will be good so when we receive pizza shop we're going to show good and if you haven't made the pizza shop broadcast message just go ahead and make it and then we show when we have the backdrop to pizza shop and we hide it when it's green flag click and we hide it when it flowers and we hide it when it's candyland and we hide him when we're in the home backdrop so there's all kinds of hiding to do with these candy store all right make sure his costumes are correct which they all should be because the candy store was cracked so the flower so that this guy copied it so he should be correct all right go ahead and change that broadcast message to pizza store and broadcast message to pizza store now what we're gonna do is instead of touching candy heart or heart candy we're gonna get rid of that because we're gonna be doing some bread so these can just be placeholders for a minute we're gonna change this by one and negative one because the pizza shop should be the easiest because the bread isn't super small all right so let's go ahead and make the pizza shop breads and then we'll finish the rest of the coat on the pizza shop guy so go into choose a sprite and then in the search bar type in bread and there's a little loaf of bread fabulous and that's just the right size you can adjust the size if you want okay when we receive the pizza shop broadcast message then what do we do then we do our forever loop then we do wait 0.2 seconds and next costume although i'm not sure i'm gonna do another costume for bread i might just leave that one costume but maybe you can do a different costume and flip it around okay and wait point two seconds and then go to random position all right let's go to home go to pizza shop and there's the bread and it's flipping all over the place yay or it's jumping all over the place i should say and there's our pizza shop guy and he can go up and down and right and left fabulous it's working all right let's hit stop now let's go into our black heart for a minute something's showing oh okay let's actually let's drag some of these um show and hides into our bread because we're gonna need the same things in our bread we only want the bread to be seen inside the pizza shop that makes sense right let me rearrange this code nicer and let's go ahead and do some duplicates of this so when i receive pizza shop i show my bread duplicate when i receive candy store i don't want my bread to show in the candy store okay it doesn't look like it's there good all right let's go back into the candy store the pizza shop guy so let's go ahead and adjust this so if i receive my pizza shop broadcast message forever i'm in a loop if i touch the bread then my money goes up by one and i wait 0.1 seconds okay and i'm also going to go to say yes and i'll duplicate that red and go into costume and this is i'm going to make a green bread because this is the yucky bread you don't want to touch this bread so let's make that green all over and let's wait point one second and point one second in our green bread and let's get rid of that next costume and let's just so it's just gonna wait point one second then it's just gonna go to random position all over and we're gonna say yes when we catch the brown bread and then when we touch the green bread or the bad bread whatever we want to call it let's call it bad bread then it's gonna be minus one all right step 24 let's make the play the lotto button so this is our fourth button that we're making so let's go into paint in our backdrop and let's just make a plain white background that says lottery now let's go into choose a sprite and let's i typed in the the um description button and i got this little green button and i just added the text play the lotto now for the code let's go into when we receive lotto show actually when we receive home show and then when this sprite is clicked switch back drop to lottery perfect and then let's go ahead and add when green flag is clicked show because we always want the lotto button to show it's sort of like the home button step 25 make the click me button to lay the lotto yay okay this is that big rectangle that i made that you might have seen earlier so we want sort of a light yellow and a light green rectangle one inside the other so there's rectangle one there's rectangle two and i'll just put that to the background and then let's go ahead and type click me let's make it a little bit bigger and then let's go ahead and type one dollar scratch off ticket one in ten chances winning you don't have to do one in ten you can do one in 20 you can do one in 100 you can do one in five all right let's create some new variables so new variable name winning number and this is inside that click me sprite that we just made and new variable name your number guess and we don't have to leave those out there we can for now okay so broadcast new message number and let's make another broadcast message new message one message i won and then let's duplicate that and this can be a message lost or message i lost message i lost okay so number i want i lost three different new broadcast messages all right let's create a new backdrop that says one and let's just make this green do you remember this from the beginning of the video a big green backdrop and we're going to add some text just to let the people know that they won the lotto they guessed the correct number from one to ten all right so at the bottom let's put some text in black we're almost done congratulations you won click me to play again awesome okay and let's duplicate that background that backdrop and let's make it red except let's not go ahead and say congratulations because this is what they get when they lost so instead of congratulations we're gonna put sorry you lost click me to play again because they can certainly play again and move that over a little bit now in the click me um code we have our new broadcast messages we have some hides and we have a show so when this sprite is clicked if make money is less than zero or is less than one and it can be equal to zero or less than zero two there's a lot of different ways you can do this say you must make money to play the lotto elves choose a number from one to ten between one and ten that's better between i like that better so when this sprite is clicked if your money is less than one you can't play else you're telling the person to choose a number between one and ten then you're gonna say join i bet you know what we're going to do answer bye this is your guess you can leave a little blank too so it's not out crowded is your guess so if i type two it will say my answer is your guess for two seconds it's just a little makes it more interactive so that people know that something's happening okay then we set your number guess two you guessed it the answer and something's gonna happen if it's right or wrong it's so simple then broadcast number the message or new message number we already did that one so broadcast number we're not going to do too much with the broadcast number right here but you could do like a high score set winning number so it's good to have that in there two pick random one to ten so that's where the code is picking a number for us and then pick an ifthenelse statement if winning number equals your number guess then change make money by one yay and if not change winning number by negative one and also let's go ahead and add in there our broadcast message i won and then a broadcast message i lost super simple now what happens when you win and lose so if the broadcast message says i lost then i want to switch backdrops to the lost backdrop which is that red one and then if the winning if the um message says i won then i want to switch the backdrop to one which is the green backdrop i just have one one nothing and one two i didn't switch the names okay so let's try it out click me pick a number between one and ten and i chose it and i lost all right awesome almost done step 26 let's make some background music i suggest different background music for every store so all you do go to freesounds.org download some music then go into your store so i'm in my flower shop and i go to sounds upload a sound and it's importing and let's i always rename it because it comes out with this crazy sound so flower shop background music or background and then we just have to code it okay that sounds good you guys can't hear it but it sounds good on my end now when i receive the message flowers forever play my song okay so let's test it out go to my flower store got you good and there's my lotto button there's my make money there's my home button awesome and my score is changing terrific got you got you all right step 27 this is our last step less than a minute to go let's make some directions on our homepage so go to our home page and write where would you like to work question mark pizza shop easiest one dollar per bread candy store harder two dollars per candy heart flower store hardest three dollars per bug you're done congratulations all right let's go ahead and show that text just on the home page and hide it everywhere else and you know how to do this because you've done this with all the different sprites it's just a game
