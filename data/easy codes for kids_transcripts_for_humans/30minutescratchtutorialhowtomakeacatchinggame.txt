00:00 - hello welcome back my name is stephanie
00:02 - with easy codes for kids
00:04 - this is a scratch tutorial not for
00:07 - beginners
00:08 - and this is going to be super fun if you
00:10 - are just starting out
00:12 - go ahead and check out some of my other
00:14 - links that might be
00:15 - a little bit easier for you if you have
00:18 - never done scratch before
00:19 - if you are a scratcher and you're
00:22 - interested in learning
00:23 - this really super fun catching game well
00:26 - join me move ahead let's go let's do
00:29 - this
00:30 - okay this is the game we are playing
00:32 - today so you avoid
00:34 - the black baseballs and you try
00:38 - and catch the different colored ones
00:40 - under 10 seconds
00:42 - and get to 15 and you win pretty easy
00:46 - and you just use the arrow keys right
00:48 - and left on your keyboard
00:50 - to go ahead and scoop up those colorful
00:52 - baseballs
00:53 - so let's play again see if i can win i
00:56 - didn't win my score's only
00:57 - two in 10 seconds i need to get it to
01:00 - 15.
01:03 - oops so if i catch a black baseball it
01:05 - subtracts five from my score
01:08 - the colorful baseballs are all just one
01:10 - point whoops
01:12 - i'm not gonna win never say never oh no
01:16 - never oh no i am really not gonna win
01:23 - um negative six i think i did better
01:26 - when i was like not really trying let's
01:28 - play again
01:29 - okay this wow i am really terrible whoa
01:34 - and i built this game come on now come
01:36 - on stuff oh no
01:37 - oh boy that hurts oh come on steph come
01:41 - on
01:42 - oh i'm gonna win i'm gonna win yay and
01:45 - so it pops up you won
01:47 - when you get the score 15 under 10
01:49 - seconds
01:50 - okay so 15 um points under 10 seconds
01:55 - that is the objective of our baseball
01:57 - game and it is
01:58 - actually pretty hard because the black
02:00 - baseballs
02:01 - are negative five and the colorful
02:04 - baseballs
02:05 - are only one and they are moving pretty
02:07 - quickly downward
02:08 - okay awesome
02:16 - okay so the first thing that we are
02:17 - going to do is we are going to
02:20 - get rid of scratch cat bye-bye so just
02:23 - go down here
02:24 - and click on this x bye
02:27 - and we are gonna pick a catcher sprite
02:30 - so down in the bottom right hand corner
02:33 - of my screen
02:34 - i hover upon choose a sprite
02:40 - and it's going to give me all these
02:42 - awesome characters to choose from
02:45 - so i'm going to go down here and get
02:48 - this gal right here
02:50 - so she has lots of different movements
02:52 - which
02:53 - um we are not gonna use we're just gonna
02:56 - have her sit there and catch
02:58 - and we're gonna want to move her left
03:00 - and right to catch the baseballs as
03:02 - they're floating down
03:12 - i just want her to go right and left so
03:16 - we want to say okay events when green
03:19 - flag is clicked let me move in a little
03:23 - bit
03:25 - when green flag is clicked we are going
03:29 - to go
03:30 - and do a little motion here and our
03:33 - little
03:33 - motion is going to be go to x
03:38 - so go to x and let's do let's just start
03:42 - her off at a position
03:43 - so let's do negative 30
03:47 - by negative 129 so we're just starting
03:50 - her right there
03:51 - at those x and y coordinates no problem
03:55 - and then let's make a forever loop that
03:57 - makes her
03:58 - run back and forth in this little
04:01 - catching position
04:02 - and catch the balls as they're coming
04:03 - down at us so
04:05 - forever
04:08 - if we are going to say left arrow is
04:12 - pressed
04:12 - change by knit change x by negative 10
04:16 - and if right arrow is pressed change by
04:19 - positive 10. so she's just gonna that
04:21 - means on the x coordinate she's going to
04:23 - go back and forth back and forth back
04:24 - and forth
04:25 - to try and catch these balls that are
04:26 - hurling down at her okay
04:28 - so now we need to tell her the keys
04:32 - so we're going to go into sensing and
04:35 - we're going to go ahead and put in
04:38 - if this key is pressed then do this so
04:41 - if
04:44 - left arrow is pressed then
04:48 - go into our emotion
04:53 - change x by
04:57 - -10 make sense
05:01 - now let's make another if
05:08 - if
05:15 - right arrow is pressed
05:24 - change x by 10 okay so
05:28 - that let's go ahead and try this out so
05:31 - play
05:32 - she's starting right down here where we
05:34 - told her on these x and y coordinates
05:36 - now let's press our left arrow okay
05:40 - awesome she changes by negative 10.
05:42 - let's press our right arrow
05:43 - she changes by positive 10. press press
05:45 - press press press
05:46 - press press press press press press
05:50 - press
05:59 - okay the next thing that we're going to
06:01 - do is let's create a
06:03 - baseball and let's have this uh be our
06:06 - negative baseball so our baseball if you
06:08 - click it if she catches it um our points
06:11 - are gonna go
06:12 - down and we haven't made points or timer
06:14 - yet but let's go ahead and make this
06:16 - black baseball sprite
06:18 - so i'm gonna go down here into my right
06:21 - uh bottom screen and i'm going to hit
06:23 - choose a sprite
06:27 - okay here is my baseball let me go ahead
06:30 - and grab that
06:36 - and here it is right here awesome
06:40 - now i the first thing i want to do is i
06:42 - don't want it to be a white baseball
06:44 - so i'm going to go into costumes
06:49 - and in fill i'm going to go ahead and
06:52 - drag this all the way over
06:54 - drag okay
07:00 - and i'm going to hit my fill bucket and
07:02 - i'm going to do click
07:03 - click okay so now this guy is black
07:07 - awesome now i'm going to go into code
07:10 - let's give him some life
07:13 - the first thing that i want to do is say
07:16 - oh go into my events
07:19 - when green flag is clicked i want to
07:23 - forever
07:24 - change his position so that's the very
07:26 - first thing that we're going to grab
07:28 - so i go into control
07:32 - make a forever loop because this game is
07:34 - just going to go on and on forever and
07:36 - ever
07:37 - all right so the first thing that i
07:39 - wanted him to do is i want him to start
07:40 - coming down
07:42 - so this is x moving side to side that's
07:44 - what our our catcher does move side to
07:46 - side and x
07:48 - and our baseball moves down in a y
07:50 - coordinate
07:51 - x y
07:55 - x y
07:58 - fabulous okay so let's go into our
08:02 - motion
08:06 - and let's look for y change y
08:12 - change y by change y by
08:15 - let's start off with negative nine so
08:19 - pretty quickly this ball is going to
08:21 - move down
08:22 - it's gonna go down very quickly actually
08:24 - negative nine is going to make it hurled
08:26 - down from space
08:28 - awesome but we can't just leave it at
08:30 - that we have to do an
08:31 - if statement saying
08:34 - go to a random position so the ball is
08:37 - always changing
08:38 - okay so let's do
08:42 - if statement because we want the ball
08:45 - to fly down at us randomly
08:49 - so we never know where it's going to
08:50 - land
08:52 - if
08:56 - y position y position y position if y
09:00 - position so if we need actually we need
09:03 - to get an operator here
09:08 - all right let's get greater than okay
09:12 - so if y position
09:18 - so this means if y position is greater
09:21 - than
09:22 - or less than if y position is less than
09:26 - negative 170
09:29 - then we're going to go to random
09:31 - position
09:35 - put this right here okay so that's how
09:37 - fast it's going to fly down
09:39 - if y position is less than negative 170
09:43 - then we want it to go to random position
09:47 - and then go to positive
09:50 - 180 okay so
09:53 - let's go ahead and hit random position
09:55 - because we want this ball to fly down
09:58 - any old way that it wants to go so we're
10:00 - always surprised by it because that's
10:02 - the fun of the game
10:04 - and then we want it to set it to
10:08 - 180. all right so let's see you'll see
10:10 - you'll see all right
10:12 - 180. okay awesome let's go ahead and try
10:14 - this out okay
10:18 - so see how it's coming down quickly
10:20 - that's that negative
10:22 - 9 and see how it is
10:25 - only coming down on the y-axis awesome
10:28 - because this is y and this is x and this
10:30 - is y and this is x
10:32 - and then it's going to random position
10:34 - it's looping because it's in a forever
10:36 - loop
10:37 - and then it's setting to 180 so it is
10:40 - resetting itself all the time
10:44 - and then running to a negative
10:47 - or running to a random position now we
10:50 - want to go ahead and
10:51 - set up a point system so that when our
10:54 - catcher
10:56 - touches it something happens and i think
10:59 - that something
10:59 - should be negative points right because
11:01 - we don't want to catch this
11:03 - baseball and i think that we
11:06 - should also make a sound
11:09 - and that's it just we just need to add
11:12 - those two things
11:13 - sound and negative points okay awesome
11:19 - okay so we have our baseball that is
11:22 - coming down
11:23 - and our gal that is going our catcher
11:27 - that is going right
11:28 - and left so let's go ahead and actually
11:31 - add something
11:31 - fun and make this actually into a game
11:36 - so we're going to do an if then
11:37 - statement
11:39 - if the black baseball touches the
11:43 - catcher
11:44 - then we're going to play a sound and
11:46 - then we're going to change the score so
11:48 - we're going to make a variable called
11:50 - score
11:51 - and then the baseball is going to go to
11:53 - a random position
11:55 - okay easy easy easy easy okay so let's
11:58 - the first thing that we want to do is
12:00 - go to variable
12:03 - and then we want to go to make a
12:06 - variable
12:08 - and the variable name is just going to
12:10 - be score
12:12 - and hit ok
12:15 - and all right so we created
12:18 - a variable a variable called score and
12:21 - it's right here
12:22 - it's already showing showing up in our
12:24 - game
12:25 - now let's go ahead and create another
12:28 - if-then statement
12:30 - so let's go into our controls
12:33 - and let's go into if then
12:36 - and drag it underneath our first if-then
12:40 - statement
12:41 - now we need a sensing
12:46 - block and the sensing block is going to
12:49 - say
12:51 - if something is touching the catcher
12:53 - then this
12:55 - so let's grab this guy right here
12:59 - put him right here if something is
13:03 - touching
13:04 - the catcher then what is going to happen
13:08 - well a couple of things we want a sound
13:10 - to play
13:11 - we want the score to change
13:14 - and then we want we want the black
13:16 - baseball to go to a random position
13:19 - so our game is fun okay so first things
13:23 - first let's go to a sound
13:27 - and instead of
13:30 - pop let's go to into our sounds and see
13:32 - what else we can find so
13:34 - come up here and hit this x we don't
13:37 - want the pop sound
13:38 - we want something more fun so go down
13:41 - here in your bottom left and hit choose
13:43 - a sound and i already have a sound in
13:49 - mind
13:51 - it's called bass beat box
13:55 - and listen to it
13:55 - [Music]
14:01 - so it sort of is like a
14:04 - like not such a great sound and you
14:06 - don't want a good sound because
14:09 - it's not a good thing when you catch the
14:10 - black baseball
14:12 - not a good thing it's going to be a
14:13 - negative point system
14:15 - with the black baseball this is going to
14:17 - be a penalty
14:18 - okay so if
14:22 - our ball is touching the catcher then
14:28 - we want to play the bass beat box until
14:32 - done
14:33 - and then we want to change the score
14:36 - so go into variables and look for
14:39 - change and it's going to be
14:45 - change my variable by 1.
14:48 - so my variable score is going to be
14:51 - negative 5. so you're penalized when you
14:54 - catch this black baseball
14:56 - okay then the next thing we want the
14:59 - baseball to do
15:00 - is to go ahead and go to a random
15:02 - position so let's go ahead into the blue
15:04 - motion
15:06 - and gather our random position
15:10 - we want the game to continue to play and
15:12 - we'll set y
15:13 - by 180.
15:17 - so set y to
15:24 - 180. so it goes back
15:27 - to a good position and the game keeps
15:29 - playing
15:31 - so let's go ahead and see what happens
15:33 - when we hit play
15:36 - [Music]
15:39 - but and the change the score changed
15:41 - negative 10
15:42 - oops i missed that one negative 15
15:45 - negative 20.
15:46 - how fast i am with my counting by fives
15:51 - i'm fabulous
15:54 - [Music]
16:05 - okay so the next thing that we want to
16:07 - do is let's go ahead and create some
16:10 - colorful baseballs we'll just create
16:13 - one and then we'll go ahead and
16:14 - duplicate them so we don't have to do
16:17 - the same work over and over again
16:19 - so down here in our sprite window at the
16:22 - bottom right
16:23 - go ahead and click choose a sprite
16:31 - okay now let's go ahead and choose
16:34 - baseball
16:37 - and there's another baseball right there
16:39 - awesome
16:41 - okay so i'm going to run through this
16:42 - code again and
16:45 - it's basically the same code
16:48 - as the black baseball except we want the
16:51 - points to go
16:52 - up and we want a different sound okay
16:55 - so i'm gonna go ahead and try and
16:59 - zoom in a little bit okay so the first
17:01 - thing that we want to do is click our
17:02 - events
17:04 - and we're going to go ahead and grab
17:05 - when flag is
17:07 - clicked let's grab a forever loop which
17:10 - will
17:11 - um loop around everything because we
17:14 - want this game to go on and on forever
17:17 - ever and ever and ever okay the first
17:19 - thing that we want to do is we want to
17:20 - decide how fast
17:22 - do we want this baseball to float
17:23 - downward so
17:25 - let's go ahead and make it pretty quick
17:28 - so let's go ahead and do y change y
17:32 - by negative eight
17:36 - so right here change x
17:39 - by whoops we don't want change x by
17:42 - change y
17:43 - because we want it to fall downward by
17:46 - negative eight and that's going to make
17:47 - it go pretty fast
17:49 - now we're going to put an iffense
17:50 - statement to make it keep moving
17:52 - correctly
17:54 - so let's go into whoops control
17:58 - and we're going to do if then underneath
18:01 - that change negative 8
18:02 - if y position is less than negative 170
18:07 - then go to random position and set y to
18:10 - 180.
18:11 - so that just means when it scrolls down
18:13 - we want it to scroll back
18:14 - up again and go down and up and down and
18:17 - up in a random sequence
18:18 - so it actually is a fun game oh
18:22 - okay so we need an operator
18:27 - and we're going to do less than
18:31 - i was calling this greater than it's
18:32 - less than
18:34 - and we're going to do
18:37 - y position which i think is
18:42 - not sensing it
18:45 - is in our motion it's down here i saw it
18:48 - get over here y position woohoo
18:52 - [Music]
18:54 - negative
18:56 - it's negative 170 what should we do
19:00 - we're going to go to random position and
19:02 - then set y to 180.
19:06 - so we'll go into our motion again this
19:09 - is like my favorite
19:10 - block ever go to random position
19:13 - and then set y by 180.
19:25 - so this is just telling the
19:28 - white baseball how to move now
19:31 - if the catcher catches the white
19:33 - baseball what is going to happen
19:36 - so we need another if statement let's go
19:38 - into our controls
19:41 - and we're going to grab this if then
19:44 - statement and put it right underneath
19:45 - our first if-then statement
19:49 - okay so if we need something sensing now
19:53 - if touching the catcher then what
19:54 - happens
19:56 - so sensing
20:03 - so not mouse pointer
20:06 - but if touching catcher
20:10 - then we want a sound we want to change
20:12 - the score
20:13 - then we want it to go to random position
20:16 - and
20:17 - keep falling downward again okay so
20:21 - let's go to sounds now we have that
20:24 - funky sound for the black baseball
20:27 - but we don't want that sound nor do we
20:29 - want this pop sound
20:32 - i want a chomp sound so i
20:35 - get rid of that first pop sound then i
20:38 - go down
20:38 - bottom left hand corner and click on
20:41 - choose a sound
20:42 - okay and
20:46 - chomp oh that's a cool one
20:53 - all right let's go ahead and click on
20:54 - that one
20:56 - now go back into our code
21:01 - and go ahead and put
21:05 - play chomp until done
21:09 - and then change score
21:16 - so we're going to go ahead and go into
21:17 - variables
21:19 - and change my variable
21:25 - so instead of my variable let's go ahead
21:28 - and change it
21:28 - and actually we can leave it by one
21:32 - so change score by one that means every
21:34 - time this little gal catches a white
21:36 - baseball or
21:38 - any of the baseballs that we're going to
21:39 - make that are different colors
21:41 - the score is going to go up by one now
21:44 - i'd like to also throw in here
21:46 - a motion that makes the baseballs more
21:49 - fun to watch
21:50 - so let's go ahead and do a turning
21:52 - motion
21:54 - and then we'll go ahead and reset it so
21:55 - it comes back up
21:58 - and goes to a random position so let's
22:00 - first let's turn
22:08 - okay so turn by 90 degrees we'll turn to
22:11 - the left
22:12 - and then we're going to set y to 180
22:14 - again
22:16 - so it goes up
22:19 - and then it'll come down and it will
22:22 - come down in a weird random position and
22:24 - we'll have no idea and it'll actually be
22:25 - a fun game
22:27 - okay awesome so let's try it out
22:32 - [Music]
22:37 - [Music]
22:39 - all right so it's moving a little slowly
22:41 - that's okay
22:44 - i have to figure that out why it's
22:45 - moving too slowly
22:47 - but i think the score is working let's
22:49 - see
22:52 - all right so it's making that chomp
22:55 - sound
22:56 - and it's um setting our score changing
22:59 - our score
23:00 - by one in a positive direction and
23:04 - um is it turning it's not turning though
23:07 - i'll have to figure out why it's not
23:08 - turning
23:11 - i'm going to go ahead and take this turn
23:13 - out then
23:16 - and i think i know what the problem is
23:19 - i'm going to go ahead and change set
23:24 - y
23:27 - right there back to 180 and all i did
23:30 - was take that rotation out
23:32 - because i'm going to go ahead and put
23:33 - that tack that on at the end
23:36 - okay awesome
23:42 - okay so let's go ahead and
23:45 - make two backdrops as our next step
23:49 - two backdrops so i go into the bottom
23:52 - right hand
23:53 - of my screen into my backdrops area
23:58 - and i'm gonna go ahead and click choose
24:00 - a backdrop
24:03 - and for my first backdrop i'm just going
24:05 - to go ahead and choose blue sky
24:08 - and there's my lovely blue sky now i'm
24:11 - going to go to my costumes tab because i
24:13 - want to add some directions
24:16 - i'm gonna click my blue sky um i wanna
24:19 - add some directions to my blue sky
24:23 - okay so i want to say
24:27 - how to basically play my game
24:30 - and so i'm going to go ahead and hit my
24:32 - text
24:34 - button there and i am going to choose my
24:38 - color my text color is black
24:41 - and i'm going to sort of start over a
24:43 - little bit towards the middle
24:45 - and i'm going to write high catchers
24:50 - exclamation point you
24:55 - have only
25:03 - 10 seconds
25:06 - to catch 15
25:09 - baseballs
25:12 - okay the next thing that we're gonna
25:14 - write is
25:15 - warning don't catch the black baseballs
25:18 - now so this is gonna be a nice little um
25:22 - piece of directions for everybody
25:24 - playing our game
25:26 - so high catchers you have only 10
25:29 - seconds to catch
25:30 - 15 baseballs warning don't catch the
25:33 - black
25:40 - baseballs
25:43 - in my black background i'm going to add
25:46 - game over
25:47 - press green flag to play again
26:23 - you
26:59 - okay this is a preview of the next
27:03 - thing that we are doing which is
27:05 - creating a sprite
27:07 - called u1 so
27:11 - sprite name u1
27:17 - so this is just a little bit of a
27:18 - preview of u1 because this is a very
27:21 - important part of our game
27:23 - so we are going to basically with the
27:26 - yuan sprite
27:29 - when the green flag is clicked we're
27:31 - going to hide
27:33 - everything and we're going to switch the
27:34 - backdrop of blue sky
27:36 - then we're going to set the score to
27:38 - zero and set the timer to zero
27:40 - then in a forever loop we are going to
27:43 - change the timer
27:45 - and it's going to go
27:48 - it's just going to give us 10 seconds
27:51 - when it hits 10 seconds
27:53 - our backdrop is going to switch to black
27:57 - and then we have a little piece of our
27:59 - score over here as well
28:00 - so when green flag is clicked if the
28:03 - score
28:04 - is less than 14 or greater than 14 it's
28:07 - going to show
28:09 - this u1 sprite and then
28:12 - it's going to stop everything else okay
28:15 - awesome
28:16 - now let's go ahead and create that piece
28:17 - by piece
28:20 - okay so let's go down here we're going
28:22 - to go ahead and create that very
28:23 - important you want sprite
28:26 - so go down here into choose a sprite
28:29 - into choose a sprite and let's just go
28:32 - ahead and click on paint
28:35 - and so we're going to go ahead and use
28:38 - our
28:38 - text in black
28:43 - to say you won
28:47 - exclamation point
28:56 - we'll put it right in the middle see
28:57 - that little cross here we're going to
28:59 - sort of drag it right in the middle
29:00 - there
29:01 - okay now let's go into the code
29:05 - and the first thing that we want to do
29:06 - is go to events when green flag is
29:09 - clicked
29:10 - we are going to hide
29:16 - a backdrop
29:20 - hide don't come out until we tell you
29:23 - when to come out
29:24 - and then we're going to switch backdrop
29:26 - to
29:30 - not black but blue
29:33 - sky okay then we're going to set our
29:37 - score to zero
29:46 - okay and we have to set our timer to
29:49 - zero
29:50 - so we don't have a timer yet so let's go
29:52 - ahead and make a variable
29:54 - called timer
29:57 - and hit ok
30:03 - and so we want to go here
30:06 - instead of instead of set my variable
30:08 - set timer
30:09 - and we're going to tell the timer what
30:12 - to do in just a second
30:14 - all right the next thing that we want to
30:15 - do is grab a forever loop
30:20 - now we want to start a weight game
30:24 - and our weight is going to tell us
30:27 - what to do as far as timing is concerned
30:30 - so
30:30 - wait one second then we're going to
30:32 - change the timer
30:34 - so back into our variables change timer
30:38 - i think you know where we're going with
30:39 - this
30:40 - change timer by one so this one second
30:44 - will make our chimer change by one okay
30:48 - all right now we want to add another
30:50 - wait one second
30:53 - after our change timer by one
30:59 - and then we are going to add a forever
31:04 - and then we're going to add an if then
31:08 - statement about the timer all right so
31:11 - let's go into our apparatus
31:15 - and let's pick this equal
31:19 - can you see where we're going see where
31:21 - we're driving yet okay
31:23 - so let's do if our timer
31:27 - equals 10 and guess what times up
31:32 - we're going to switch to our backdrop
31:33 - that we just made
31:38 - which is black because the game is over
31:42 - and it says game over on our black
31:43 - backdrop then we're going to stop
31:45 - everything
31:46 - we're going to go to variables oh i'm
31:48 - sorry we're going to go to control
31:49 - [Music]
31:51 - and we're going to stop all of our
31:54 - events
31:56 - okay so we have hide
32:00 - when the green flag is clicked so
32:02 - everything is hidden except
32:04 - the blue sky we set our timer or excuse
32:07 - me we set our score to zero
32:08 - and then we set our timer to zero in
32:11 - this forever loop
32:12 - we have wait a second then change timer
32:15 - by one then wait a second
32:18 - now it's gonna so that's going to give
32:19 - our contestants our game players
32:23 - um a timer countdown
32:27 - and the timer is gonna go from zero
32:31 - to one two three four five six seven
32:33 - eight nine and when it reaches ten
32:35 - it's going to switch the backdrop to
32:37 - black which says game over
32:39 - and then it's gonna say stop all okay
32:42 - now we want to do one more thing and
32:45 - that is we are going to add
32:47 - our score so let's go into events
32:53 - and when green flag is clicked let's do
32:56 - a forever loop here
32:58 - forever and ever and ever
33:03 - forever forever is a long time
33:06 - let's do an if then
33:12 - we need an operator in
33:15 - a greater than so we're gonna do
33:19 - if the score is greater than 14 you won
33:22 - i just let the cat out of the bag
33:24 - i know it's so suspenseful to see what
33:27 - i'm gonna do next
33:28 - if score is greater than 14
33:32 - then show this little sprite you won
33:39 - right and then stop all
33:45 - and give the people a chance to play
33:48 - again
33:50 - if they dare so let's play
33:59 - oh i accidentally put a bow tie in there
34:02 - what the heck
34:03 - all right four score seems to be working
34:06 - and i'm just
34:07 - terrible i am just not winning at all
34:10 - okay
34:11 - come on come on win win win win win i
34:14 - only have oh i am not gonna win
34:15 - definitely not gonna win
34:17 - game over yay
34:21 - oh why am i cheering i lost but game
34:24 - over worked yay
34:39 - okay the next thing that i want to do is
34:41 - i want to make
34:42 - more baseballs so our game actually
34:45 - becomes pretty competitive
34:47 - so i go here to baseball two and i right
34:51 - click
34:52 - and i hit duplicate and
34:55 - the first thing that i want to do with
34:57 - baseball number three is i'm going to
34:59 - turn it red
35:01 - so i'm going to go to my fill bucket
35:05 - and go ahead and click on
35:12 - turn my color red deep red
35:16 - and click to make it red awesome now
35:20 - i don't want the exact same code in my
35:23 - black
35:24 - baseball as in or in my white baseball
35:26 - as in my red baseball
35:27 - so let's go over into the code of the
35:30 - red baseball
35:31 - and this has been duplicated it's the
35:32 - exact same thing that is in the white
35:35 - baseball
35:35 - so let's go ahead and change that up a
35:37 - little bit so
35:38 - instead of change y
35:42 - you zoom in a little bit
35:46 - instead of change y by negative eight
35:48 - let's make it go a little slower
35:50 - so change y by negative four
35:54 - and if it's catching if it's touching
35:56 - the catcher it will play the chomp sound
35:59 - change the score by one and we'll set
36:02 - y to it will go back to 180.
36:05 - okay perfect that looks pretty good
36:08 - all right let's go ahead and right-click
36:11 - and duplicate this guy
36:14 - first thing we want to do is change his
36:16 - color let's go into the fill bucket
36:22 - and let's move a little bit over more
36:24 - into the orange awesome
36:29 - oops i changed one of his little
36:31 - stitches that's okay let's go into the
36:33 - code
36:34 - and instead of change y by negative 4
36:37 - let's do change y by negative 5.
36:40 - let's duplicate him let's make this guy
36:44 - yellow
36:46 - so go into costumes
36:49 - fill bucket moving on over
36:54 - awesome
36:58 - perfect oh you can see the little orange
37:00 - stitch
37:03 - okay and let's do a pink baseball
37:08 - so you know the drill right click
37:11 - duplicate
37:15 - oh wait let's go back into code here
37:20 - instead of change by negative five let's
37:22 - do change by negative three
37:25 - okay right click duplicate
37:31 - instead of change by negative three
37:33 - let's do change by negative
37:35 - nine so that'll go super fast costumes
37:38 - and let's make this guy yellow
37:40 - or instead of yellow let's make this guy
37:42 - pink
37:48 - it's like more like a fuchsia awesome
37:52 - okay so we have
37:57 - one two three four five good baseballs
38:02 - one bad baseball let's go ahead and
38:05 - click on our bad baseball
38:07 - and right click and duplicate our bad
38:09 - baseball
38:11 - awesome so we have two bad baseballs
38:14 - that are coming down towards our catcher
38:15 - and one two three four
38:16 - five good ones so five ones five good
38:20 - baseballs that will give us points
38:22 - and two bad baseballs that will subtract
38:24 - points
38:26 - and let's check our code on this bad
38:28 - baseball here
38:32 - yep and his score is going to be
38:34 - negative five
38:35 - awesome so let's stop and play our game
38:57 - come on you can do this you're gonna win
38:59 - just get more
39:00 - then you do you're gonna do it you're
39:03 - won
39:04 - yay good job
39:07 - thank you you're welcome

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome back my name is stephanie with easy codes for kids this is a scratch tutorial not for beginners and this is going to be super fun if you are just starting out go ahead and check out some of my other links that might be a little bit easier for you if you have never done scratch before if you are a scratcher and you're interested in learning this really super fun catching game well join me move ahead let's go let's do this okay this is the game we are playing today so you avoid the black baseballs and you try and catch the different colored ones under 10 seconds and get to 15 and you win pretty easy and you just use the arrow keys right and left on your keyboard to go ahead and scoop up those colorful baseballs so let's play again see if i can win i didn't win my score's only two in 10 seconds i need to get it to 15. oops so if i catch a black baseball it subtracts five from my score the colorful baseballs are all just one point whoops i'm not gonna win never say never oh no never oh no i am really not gonna win um negative six i think i did better when i was like not really trying let's play again okay this wow i am really terrible whoa and i built this game come on now come on stuff oh no oh boy that hurts oh come on steph come on oh i'm gonna win i'm gonna win yay and so it pops up you won when you get the score 15 under 10 seconds okay so 15 um points under 10 seconds that is the objective of our baseball game and it is actually pretty hard because the black baseballs are negative five and the colorful baseballs are only one and they are moving pretty quickly downward okay awesome okay so the first thing that we are going to do is we are going to get rid of scratch cat byebye so just go down here and click on this x bye and we are gonna pick a catcher sprite so down in the bottom right hand corner of my screen i hover upon choose a sprite and it's going to give me all these awesome characters to choose from so i'm going to go down here and get this gal right here so she has lots of different movements which um we are not gonna use we're just gonna have her sit there and catch and we're gonna want to move her left and right to catch the baseballs as they're floating down i just want her to go right and left so we want to say okay events when green flag is clicked let me move in a little bit when green flag is clicked we are going to go and do a little motion here and our little motion is going to be go to x so go to x and let's do let's just start her off at a position so let's do negative 30 by negative 129 so we're just starting her right there at those x and y coordinates no problem and then let's make a forever loop that makes her run back and forth in this little catching position and catch the balls as they're coming down at us so forever if we are going to say left arrow is pressed change by knit change x by negative 10 and if right arrow is pressed change by positive 10. so she's just gonna that means on the x coordinate she's going to go back and forth back and forth back and forth to try and catch these balls that are hurling down at her okay so now we need to tell her the keys so we're going to go into sensing and we're going to go ahead and put in if this key is pressed then do this so if left arrow is pressed then go into our emotion change x by 10 make sense now let's make another if if right arrow is pressed change x by 10 okay so that let's go ahead and try this out so play she's starting right down here where we told her on these x and y coordinates now let's press our left arrow okay awesome she changes by negative 10. let's press our right arrow she changes by positive 10. press press press press press press press press press press press press okay the next thing that we're going to do is let's create a baseball and let's have this uh be our negative baseball so our baseball if you click it if she catches it um our points are gonna go down and we haven't made points or timer yet but let's go ahead and make this black baseball sprite so i'm gonna go down here into my right uh bottom screen and i'm going to hit choose a sprite okay here is my baseball let me go ahead and grab that and here it is right here awesome now i the first thing i want to do is i don't want it to be a white baseball so i'm going to go into costumes and in fill i'm going to go ahead and drag this all the way over drag okay and i'm going to hit my fill bucket and i'm going to do click click okay so now this guy is black awesome now i'm going to go into code let's give him some life the first thing that i want to do is say oh go into my events when green flag is clicked i want to forever change his position so that's the very first thing that we're going to grab so i go into control make a forever loop because this game is just going to go on and on forever and ever all right so the first thing that i wanted him to do is i want him to start coming down so this is x moving side to side that's what our our catcher does move side to side and x and our baseball moves down in a y coordinate x y x y fabulous okay so let's go into our motion and let's look for y change y change y by change y by let's start off with negative nine so pretty quickly this ball is going to move down it's gonna go down very quickly actually negative nine is going to make it hurled down from space awesome but we can't just leave it at that we have to do an if statement saying go to a random position so the ball is always changing okay so let's do if statement because we want the ball to fly down at us randomly so we never know where it's going to land if y position y position y position if y position so if we need actually we need to get an operator here all right let's get greater than okay so if y position so this means if y position is greater than or less than if y position is less than negative 170 then we're going to go to random position put this right here okay so that's how fast it's going to fly down if y position is less than negative 170 then we want it to go to random position and then go to positive 180 okay so let's go ahead and hit random position because we want this ball to fly down any old way that it wants to go so we're always surprised by it because that's the fun of the game and then we want it to set it to 180. all right so let's see you'll see you'll see all right 180. okay awesome let's go ahead and try this out okay so see how it's coming down quickly that's that negative 9 and see how it is only coming down on the yaxis awesome because this is y and this is x and this is y and this is x and then it's going to random position it's looping because it's in a forever loop and then it's setting to 180 so it is resetting itself all the time and then running to a negative or running to a random position now we want to go ahead and set up a point system so that when our catcher touches it something happens and i think that something should be negative points right because we don't want to catch this baseball and i think that we should also make a sound and that's it just we just need to add those two things sound and negative points okay awesome okay so we have our baseball that is coming down and our gal that is going our catcher that is going right and left so let's go ahead and actually add something fun and make this actually into a game so we're going to do an if then statement if the black baseball touches the catcher then we're going to play a sound and then we're going to change the score so we're going to make a variable called score and then the baseball is going to go to a random position okay easy easy easy easy okay so let's the first thing that we want to do is go to variable and then we want to go to make a variable and the variable name is just going to be score and hit ok and all right so we created a variable a variable called score and it's right here it's already showing showing up in our game now let's go ahead and create another ifthen statement so let's go into our controls and let's go into if then and drag it underneath our first ifthen statement now we need a sensing block and the sensing block is going to say if something is touching the catcher then this so let's grab this guy right here put him right here if something is touching the catcher then what is going to happen well a couple of things we want a sound to play we want the score to change and then we want we want the black baseball to go to a random position so our game is fun okay so first things first let's go to a sound and instead of pop let's go to into our sounds and see what else we can find so come up here and hit this x we don't want the pop sound we want something more fun so go down here in your bottom left and hit choose a sound and i already have a sound in mind it's called bass beat box and listen to it so it sort of is like a like not such a great sound and you don't want a good sound because it's not a good thing when you catch the black baseball not a good thing it's going to be a negative point system with the black baseball this is going to be a penalty okay so if our ball is touching the catcher then we want to play the bass beat box until done and then we want to change the score so go into variables and look for change and it's going to be change my variable by 1. so my variable score is going to be negative 5. so you're penalized when you catch this black baseball okay then the next thing we want the baseball to do is to go ahead and go to a random position so let's go ahead into the blue motion and gather our random position we want the game to continue to play and we'll set y by 180. so set y to 180. so it goes back to a good position and the game keeps playing so let's go ahead and see what happens when we hit play but and the change the score changed negative 10 oops i missed that one negative 15 negative 20. how fast i am with my counting by fives i'm fabulous okay so the next thing that we want to do is let's go ahead and create some colorful baseballs we'll just create one and then we'll go ahead and duplicate them so we don't have to do the same work over and over again so down here in our sprite window at the bottom right go ahead and click choose a sprite okay now let's go ahead and choose baseball and there's another baseball right there awesome okay so i'm going to run through this code again and it's basically the same code as the black baseball except we want the points to go up and we want a different sound okay so i'm gonna go ahead and try and zoom in a little bit okay so the first thing that we want to do is click our events and we're going to go ahead and grab when flag is clicked let's grab a forever loop which will um loop around everything because we want this game to go on and on forever ever and ever and ever okay the first thing that we want to do is we want to decide how fast do we want this baseball to float downward so let's go ahead and make it pretty quick so let's go ahead and do y change y by negative eight so right here change x by whoops we don't want change x by change y because we want it to fall downward by negative eight and that's going to make it go pretty fast now we're going to put an iffense statement to make it keep moving correctly so let's go into whoops control and we're going to do if then underneath that change negative 8 if y position is less than negative 170 then go to random position and set y to 180. so that just means when it scrolls down we want it to scroll back up again and go down and up and down and up in a random sequence so it actually is a fun game oh okay so we need an operator and we're going to do less than i was calling this greater than it's less than and we're going to do y position which i think is not sensing it is in our motion it's down here i saw it get over here y position woohoo negative it's negative 170 what should we do we're going to go to random position and then set y to 180. so we'll go into our motion again this is like my favorite block ever go to random position and then set y by 180. so this is just telling the white baseball how to move now if the catcher catches the white baseball what is going to happen so we need another if statement let's go into our controls and we're going to grab this if then statement and put it right underneath our first ifthen statement okay so if we need something sensing now if touching the catcher then what happens so sensing so not mouse pointer but if touching catcher then we want a sound we want to change the score then we want it to go to random position and keep falling downward again okay so let's go to sounds now we have that funky sound for the black baseball but we don't want that sound nor do we want this pop sound i want a chomp sound so i get rid of that first pop sound then i go down bottom left hand corner and click on choose a sound okay and chomp oh that's a cool one all right let's go ahead and click on that one now go back into our code and go ahead and put play chomp until done and then change score so we're going to go ahead and go into variables and change my variable so instead of my variable let's go ahead and change it and actually we can leave it by one so change score by one that means every time this little gal catches a white baseball or any of the baseballs that we're going to make that are different colors the score is going to go up by one now i'd like to also throw in here a motion that makes the baseballs more fun to watch so let's go ahead and do a turning motion and then we'll go ahead and reset it so it comes back up and goes to a random position so let's first let's turn okay so turn by 90 degrees we'll turn to the left and then we're going to set y to 180 again so it goes up and then it'll come down and it will come down in a weird random position and we'll have no idea and it'll actually be a fun game okay awesome so let's try it out all right so it's moving a little slowly that's okay i have to figure that out why it's moving too slowly but i think the score is working let's see all right so it's making that chomp sound and it's um setting our score changing our score by one in a positive direction and um is it turning it's not turning though i'll have to figure out why it's not turning i'm going to go ahead and take this turn out then and i think i know what the problem is i'm going to go ahead and change set y right there back to 180 and all i did was take that rotation out because i'm going to go ahead and put that tack that on at the end okay awesome okay so let's go ahead and make two backdrops as our next step two backdrops so i go into the bottom right hand of my screen into my backdrops area and i'm gonna go ahead and click choose a backdrop and for my first backdrop i'm just going to go ahead and choose blue sky and there's my lovely blue sky now i'm going to go to my costumes tab because i want to add some directions i'm gonna click my blue sky um i wanna add some directions to my blue sky okay so i want to say how to basically play my game and so i'm going to go ahead and hit my text button there and i am going to choose my color my text color is black and i'm going to sort of start over a little bit towards the middle and i'm going to write high catchers exclamation point you have only 10 seconds to catch 15 baseballs okay the next thing that we're gonna write is warning don't catch the black baseballs now so this is gonna be a nice little um piece of directions for everybody playing our game so high catchers you have only 10 seconds to catch 15 baseballs warning don't catch the black baseballs in my black background i'm going to add game over press green flag to play again you okay this is a preview of the next thing that we are doing which is creating a sprite called u1 so sprite name u1 so this is just a little bit of a preview of u1 because this is a very important part of our game so we are going to basically with the yuan sprite when the green flag is clicked we're going to hide everything and we're going to switch the backdrop of blue sky then we're going to set the score to zero and set the timer to zero then in a forever loop we are going to change the timer and it's going to go it's just going to give us 10 seconds when it hits 10 seconds our backdrop is going to switch to black and then we have a little piece of our score over here as well so when green flag is clicked if the score is less than 14 or greater than 14 it's going to show this u1 sprite and then it's going to stop everything else okay awesome now let's go ahead and create that piece by piece okay so let's go down here we're going to go ahead and create that very important you want sprite so go down here into choose a sprite into choose a sprite and let's just go ahead and click on paint and so we're going to go ahead and use our text in black to say you won exclamation point we'll put it right in the middle see that little cross here we're going to sort of drag it right in the middle there okay now let's go into the code and the first thing that we want to do is go to events when green flag is clicked we are going to hide a backdrop hide don't come out until we tell you when to come out and then we're going to switch backdrop to not black but blue sky okay then we're going to set our score to zero okay and we have to set our timer to zero so we don't have a timer yet so let's go ahead and make a variable called timer and hit ok and so we want to go here instead of instead of set my variable set timer and we're going to tell the timer what to do in just a second all right the next thing that we want to do is grab a forever loop now we want to start a weight game and our weight is going to tell us what to do as far as timing is concerned so wait one second then we're going to change the timer so back into our variables change timer i think you know where we're going with this change timer by one so this one second will make our chimer change by one okay all right now we want to add another wait one second after our change timer by one and then we are going to add a forever and then we're going to add an if then statement about the timer all right so let's go into our apparatus and let's pick this equal can you see where we're going see where we're driving yet okay so let's do if our timer equals 10 and guess what times up we're going to switch to our backdrop that we just made which is black because the game is over and it says game over on our black backdrop then we're going to stop everything we're going to go to variables oh i'm sorry we're going to go to control and we're going to stop all of our events okay so we have hide when the green flag is clicked so everything is hidden except the blue sky we set our timer or excuse me we set our score to zero and then we set our timer to zero in this forever loop we have wait a second then change timer by one then wait a second now it's gonna so that's going to give our contestants our game players um a timer countdown and the timer is gonna go from zero to one two three four five six seven eight nine and when it reaches ten it's going to switch the backdrop to black which says game over and then it's gonna say stop all okay now we want to do one more thing and that is we are going to add our score so let's go into events and when green flag is clicked let's do a forever loop here forever and ever and ever forever forever is a long time let's do an if then we need an operator in a greater than so we're gonna do if the score is greater than 14 you won i just let the cat out of the bag i know it's so suspenseful to see what i'm gonna do next if score is greater than 14 then show this little sprite you won right and then stop all and give the people a chance to play again if they dare so let's play oh i accidentally put a bow tie in there what the heck all right four score seems to be working and i'm just terrible i am just not winning at all okay come on come on win win win win win i only have oh i am not gonna win definitely not gonna win game over yay oh why am i cheering i lost but game over worked yay okay the next thing that i want to do is i want to make more baseballs so our game actually becomes pretty competitive so i go here to baseball two and i right click and i hit duplicate and the first thing that i want to do with baseball number three is i'm going to turn it red so i'm going to go to my fill bucket and go ahead and click on turn my color red deep red and click to make it red awesome now i don't want the exact same code in my black baseball as in or in my white baseball as in my red baseball so let's go over into the code of the red baseball and this has been duplicated it's the exact same thing that is in the white baseball so let's go ahead and change that up a little bit so instead of change y you zoom in a little bit instead of change y by negative eight let's make it go a little slower so change y by negative four and if it's catching if it's touching the catcher it will play the chomp sound change the score by one and we'll set y to it will go back to 180. okay perfect that looks pretty good all right let's go ahead and rightclick and duplicate this guy first thing we want to do is change his color let's go into the fill bucket and let's move a little bit over more into the orange awesome oops i changed one of his little stitches that's okay let's go into the code and instead of change y by negative 4 let's do change y by negative 5. let's duplicate him let's make this guy yellow so go into costumes fill bucket moving on over awesome perfect oh you can see the little orange stitch okay and let's do a pink baseball so you know the drill right click duplicate oh wait let's go back into code here instead of change by negative five let's do change by negative three okay right click duplicate instead of change by negative three let's do change by negative nine so that'll go super fast costumes and let's make this guy yellow or instead of yellow let's make this guy pink it's like more like a fuchsia awesome okay so we have one two three four five good baseballs one bad baseball let's go ahead and click on our bad baseball and right click and duplicate our bad baseball awesome so we have two bad baseballs that are coming down towards our catcher and one two three four five good ones so five ones five good baseballs that will give us points and two bad baseballs that will subtract points and let's check our code on this bad baseball here yep and his score is going to be negative five awesome so let's stop and play our game come on you can do this you're gonna win just get more then you do you're gonna do it you're won yay good job thank you you're welcome
