00:01 - it's almost
00:03 - christmas let's draw a super cute grinch
00:06 - in scratch
00:07 - [Music]
00:09 - okay so i am in my vector setting in
00:12 - scratch and i've picked
00:15 - this fun little drawing that i did in
00:18 - a paint editor and i put it right in the
00:20 - corner so it can be
00:22 - our little example that we are using
00:26 - and i'm picking this nice lime
00:30 - it's sort of like an ugly lime color for
00:33 - the grinch because he is sort of a
00:35 - villainous character at least at the
00:36 - beginning of the grinch movies
00:39 - so the first thing that i'm going to do
00:41 - is i am just going to draw a bunch of
00:43 - shapes without an outline so i'm going
00:46 - to draw a circle and then a sideways
00:49 - oval
00:50 - and then a little rectangle then for his
00:53 - belly another
00:54 - oval and for his
00:58 - legs i'm going to draw a series of just
01:00 - nice little rectangles
01:05 - and i'm going to go ahead and fool
01:07 - around with the
01:09 - shapes a little bit move them the way i
01:10 - like them again there's no
01:12 - outline color it's just this lime green
01:14 - color
01:20 - now let's get a closer look of him and
01:24 - let's see what we can add first so the
01:27 - first thing that i'm going to tackle is
01:29 - the bottom of his belly i'm going to
01:31 - pull up
01:32 - and then using my points i'm going to
01:35 - sort of make
01:36 - shoulders and the side of his stomach
01:38 - come in a little bit
01:40 - now i'm going to do the shape for his
01:43 - arms which is just a little rectangle
01:47 - i have a couple of rectangles that i'm
01:49 - just going to put together
01:52 - so he's sort of looking like he's in
01:55 - a stance where he has his hands on his
01:58 - little fat belly and there's just a
02:01 - little block for his
02:03 - um hand and i'm continuing to just use
02:07 - my points
02:08 - [Music]
02:10 - to um sort of slim him down
02:13 - so he's gonna have like a big torso a
02:16 - big belly area and then really thin
02:18 - little limbs
02:20 - okay so i make a little um mouth for him
02:23 - and it's the thickness um it's black and
02:26 - thickness too
02:27 - then i'm gonna go ahead and add a little
02:28 - circle where i want his chin
02:31 - and i'm adding little pieces for his
02:35 - mouth where his little evil grin
02:37 - is going to be
02:40 - so i add a straight line and then i add
02:44 - so i add a straight line and then i add
02:46 - extra points
02:47 - then i copy and paste them and put them
02:50 - to the other side
02:51 - i flip them horizontal too flip this
02:54 - little line horizontal so i get its
02:56 - exact match now you don't have to be
02:58 - matchy-matchy
02:59 - now with the now with the head
03:03 - i'm gonna add more points and i'm gonna
03:05 - bring it up a little bit
03:08 - my outline i'm gonna start outlining
03:10 - everything in black
03:12 - thickness two
03:18 - [Music]
03:24 - now i group the head pieces together
03:28 - and i'm going to try and hide them a
03:30 - little bit by ungrouping and then moving
03:32 - forward and backward
03:36 - i'm going to bring his the bottom piece
03:39 - of his face
03:40 - up a little bit
03:43 - and i'm not going to be super concerned
03:45 - about what the top of his head is gonna
03:46 - look like
03:47 - because i'm gonna delete it so i delete
03:49 - that circle
03:50 - that was just a placer that was just a
03:53 - place mark for me to understand
03:55 - where his little hat was gonna go so now
03:57 - i add
03:58 - a little crinkle in his face
04:10 - [Music]
04:12 - and that just makes um a more definition
04:18 - and i'm going to add a little bit more
04:20 - to his smile his smile can be crooked
04:23 - he is sort of again like this evil
04:25 - character so he can have more of an evil
04:27 - smile right now
04:29 - this is before of course he turns super
04:31 - good and saves christmas
04:34 - so let's go ahead and start drawing his
04:36 - eyes i just drew a circle
04:38 - and then i'm going to make several
04:40 - points at the top of my circle
04:42 - and at the bottom of my circle and when
04:44 - i get it to be sort of like
04:46 - um more squarish on the bottom
04:49 - i'm going to fool around i'm going to
04:51 - have a top-down gradient
04:53 - color and then i'm gonna have the colors
04:56 - the two colors be sort of a brownish on
04:58 - top
04:59 - and a whitish on bottom
05:04 - and i just fool around with the colors
05:06 - until i get them just the way i like
05:08 - them
05:10 - and i only have to do one eye
05:13 - because i'm going to copy and paste it
05:15 - to the other side
05:16 - so now i'm going to go ahead and just
05:18 - get little white circles
05:20 - and those will be like my reflection
05:22 - points in my eyes
05:24 - and i do two of them now i'm going to go
05:27 - ahead and make
05:28 - a size 2
05:31 - little crease in his eye
05:35 - and i'm pretty much done with his eye
05:38 - now i'm going to go ahead
05:39 - and get all my pieces i think there are
05:41 - four pieces
05:42 - i group them copy paste and then flip
05:45 - them horizontal to the other side
05:48 - now he's looking really happy so let's
05:50 - go ahead and put some
05:52 - little naughty eyebrows on him just
05:54 - using our line tool
05:55 - and one little point in the middle so i
05:58 - get a good one then i copy paste flip
06:00 - horizontal
06:02 - and put it to the other side now i'm
06:03 - working with his chin
06:05 - i put it to the back and then using my
06:08 - points tool
06:09 - i'm just gonna go ahead and fool around
06:12 - with his face a little bit more
06:15 - and i made the bottom of his chin
06:18 - stick out a little bit in a point
06:22 - and then i went ahead and made his
06:24 - outline a
06:26 - three on his face i'm gonna keep his
06:28 - smile at two
06:31 - and i bring his little nose down and i'm
06:34 - going to bring
06:34 - a little mouth piece down and then
06:39 - put his nose in front there there we go
06:42 - and i bring his little creases for his
06:45 - face down
06:46 - and i can use the arrow keys on my
06:48 - keyboard just to
06:50 - move the little pieces that i like very
06:53 - very slowly
06:55 - and get them just the way i want them
06:58 - so now he's looking a little bit more
07:00 - knotty
07:04 - okay let's go ahead and try and do his
07:07 - hat
07:08 - so i'm in my brush tool size five black
07:12 - and i'm making hit little curlicues all
07:15 - over
07:16 - the bottom of his head and then the top
07:18 - of his head
07:21 - and i made some little accent marks in
07:23 - there i might keep those i might not
07:26 - and then now with my line tool i did use
07:28 - my brush and i didn't like it so go
07:30 - ahead and use your line tool to make his
07:32 - hat
07:33 - and i just made like a nice curl at the
07:35 - top
07:37 - and then i'm going to make a
07:40 - size 4 or size 5 outline
07:43 - for this line for his hat
07:47 - and i have one like almost upside down v
07:51 - and then one piece that is just almost
07:55 - straight up and then connected to that
08:00 - last point on his hat
08:03 - so it's sort of a slouchy santa hat and
08:06 - it's like sort of
08:06 - cocked to the side now i like to go
08:09 - ahead and just use my brush tool and
08:11 - fill everything in
08:12 - in white for the fluff part but you can
08:15 - use
08:15 - the circle tool and just add extra
08:19 - points and fill it in that way too
08:21 - but i like to paint
08:24 - and you don't have to be very um real
08:27 - super careful with this
08:29 - because you can always pull your outline
08:32 - in front
08:32 - because you made it a separate piece
08:35 - [Music]
08:36 - and so i'm just coloring coloring white
08:40 - get all his little pieces down
08:42 - [Music]
08:51 - and now i'm going to go ahead and
08:54 - [Music]
08:55 - group his hat and i make a bottom so i
08:58 - get
08:58 - those nice three pieces and then i can
09:00 - turn it red
09:02 - and now i'm going to go ahead and move
09:04 - it so it's a little bit less to the side
09:07 - and pull it down
09:09 - so you can see the fluff part instead of
09:12 - that straight line
09:14 - now i'm going to go ahead and move my
09:16 - outline of my fluff part
09:17 - to the front and it can be uneven it's
09:22 - supposed to be like slouchy looking and
09:23 - sort of uneven
09:29 - [Music]
09:34 - and i make a little slouchy mark in the
09:37 - corner of the top of his hat
09:42 - so it looks as if it is really angled
09:44 - downwards like you'd have a natural
09:46 - wrinkle there
09:51 - and now i'm going to draw the fluff part
09:54 - um of his hat the end of his hat the tip
09:57 - of it
09:58 - and again i'm just going to go ahead and
10:00 - use my paint tool
10:01 - to just paint it white and i don't have
10:04 - to worry about being perfect
10:08 - because i can go ahead and grab i made a
10:11 - little white reflection point in his hat
10:13 - as well and now i'm going to go ahead
10:14 - and make a little accent point in his
10:15 - white fluff
10:17 - but i can go ahead and grab any of those
10:19 - outlines i want and pull them to the
10:21 - front
10:23 - perfect oh he's looking very evil isn't
10:26 - he
10:26 - let's go ahead and outline his body now
10:30 - i think i'm outlining it in two or three
10:33 - just black
10:41 - i'm going to go ahead and put that arm
10:43 - piece to the back
10:45 - so his belly sticks out and i'm going to
10:48 - adjust the arm he has real skinny little
10:50 - arms or at least
10:51 - in my head he has very skinny little
10:52 - limbs
10:54 - and a bigger belly
10:59 - so i'm going to make him a little fun
11:01 - here
11:03 - i put his points over and
11:06 - just connect that little arm piece
11:12 - and i can go ahead and delete any of the
11:14 - blocks that i made at first
11:16 - because those were just placers those
11:18 - were just
11:20 - fun little reference points that we had
11:24 - oh his arm is looking more like an arm i
11:26 - might even give it like a little bit
11:27 - more shoulder here
11:29 - he's supposed to have sort of weak
11:31 - shoulders so that's why they sort of
11:33 - droop down
11:34 - instead of sticking out okay now i'm
11:37 - going to go ahead and use that marker
11:39 - that block that i have
11:41 - and i'm just going to use my points
11:44 - and draw out
11:49 - like a little point for his fingers i'm
11:51 - not worried about fingers i'm not going
11:53 - to define fingers
11:54 - i just have one little point and i make
11:56 - his wrist
11:59 - thin and it's to the back
12:02 - because he has his hand on his hip there
12:05 - okay now i'm going to go ahead and grab
12:07 - that leg block
12:08 - and i will make it give it some extra
12:11 - points
12:16 - and make it thin
12:20 - and i'm looking anytime i'm not real
12:23 - sure where
12:24 - i'm going i just look at the original
12:26 - drawing that i did
12:29 - [Music]
12:31 - and then that gives me sort of an angle
12:33 - now his feet i want to sort of be like a
12:34 - funny shape
12:35 - so he has like an arch in the middle of
12:38 - his foot he has like no distinguishable
12:40 - toes or anything
12:42 - and his heel comes down and there's like
12:44 - an arch
12:45 - and when i like it it's a simple simple
12:47 - leg there's his little knee
12:49 - when i like it i just copy paste flip
12:51 - horizontal
12:52 - and then i'm going to put it back a
12:55 - little bit further so
12:56 - it doesn't exactly match and the arm
12:59 - doesn't exactly match the other arm
13:01 - so they're back a little bit more
13:03 - they're higher on one side than the
13:05 - other
13:06 - just it just makes it a little bit more
13:07 - realistic let's go ahead and work on his
13:10 - body
13:11 - i want him to be plump around the middle
13:13 - but not too plump
13:15 - [Music]
13:16 - so i just add extra points to his torso
13:19 - now i give him like a little belly
13:21 - button
13:22 - thing little belly button line it does
13:24 - not have to be perfect
13:26 - now let's go ahead and use our line tool
13:29 - and i'm going to get a series of
13:31 - v's upside down v's
13:35 - and i'm gonna make his little like fun
13:37 - little scruff
13:39 - that i i'm gonna do it in an outline
13:41 - thickness of two and then i'm gonna go
13:43 - ahead and color it a darker olive
13:46 - so if when i get these points that i
13:48 - like i'm just going to copy and paste
13:50 - them
13:52 - because why do extra work when you have
13:54 - copy and paste that's the beautiful
13:55 - thing about computers
13:59 - okay so i'm going to turn that i'm going
14:01 - to get these points
14:03 - i'm going to use shift key copy paste
14:09 - after i've grouped them and then i flip
14:11 - horizontal
14:12 - and then i'll just make some lines to
14:14 - meet up in the middle
14:16 - where i'm missing some okay now i'm
14:19 - going to use my select tool and i'm
14:20 - going to select all of them
14:22 - and then group them
14:26 - and i can try and use my fill a little
14:28 - bit it'll fill it a little bit
14:30 - and then all i have to do is add a
14:32 - circle in the middle
14:34 - and just fool around with extra points
14:36 - in the circle
14:40 - and give it no outline so you see the
14:43 - points outline
14:49 - and i select everything and turn it like
14:52 - a
14:53 - booger shade like a dark yucky greenish
14:58 - same type of shade of his skin except
15:00 - darker
15:01 - because he remember he is an evil
15:03 - character until he turns good
15:05 - we're not supposed to like be in love
15:07 - with him he's supposed to be
15:08 - sort of like this scary monstery type of
15:12 - person creature so now i'm just fooling
15:15 - around with my
15:18 - with my points
15:28 - and i get everything the way i like it
15:31 - and then i hit group
15:35 - and i pull it over voila we're done

Cleaned transcript:

it's almost christmas let's draw a super cute grinch in scratch okay so i am in my vector setting in scratch and i've picked this fun little drawing that i did in a paint editor and i put it right in the corner so it can be our little example that we are using and i'm picking this nice lime it's sort of like an ugly lime color for the grinch because he is sort of a villainous character at least at the beginning of the grinch movies so the first thing that i'm going to do is i am just going to draw a bunch of shapes without an outline so i'm going to draw a circle and then a sideways oval and then a little rectangle then for his belly another oval and for his legs i'm going to draw a series of just nice little rectangles and i'm going to go ahead and fool around with the shapes a little bit move them the way i like them again there's no outline color it's just this lime green color now let's get a closer look of him and let's see what we can add first so the first thing that i'm going to tackle is the bottom of his belly i'm going to pull up and then using my points i'm going to sort of make shoulders and the side of his stomach come in a little bit now i'm going to do the shape for his arms which is just a little rectangle i have a couple of rectangles that i'm just going to put together so he's sort of looking like he's in a stance where he has his hands on his little fat belly and there's just a little block for his um hand and i'm continuing to just use my points to um sort of slim him down so he's gonna have like a big torso a big belly area and then really thin little limbs okay so i make a little um mouth for him and it's the thickness um it's black and thickness too then i'm gonna go ahead and add a little circle where i want his chin and i'm adding little pieces for his mouth where his little evil grin is going to be so i add a straight line and then i add so i add a straight line and then i add extra points then i copy and paste them and put them to the other side i flip them horizontal too flip this little line horizontal so i get its exact match now you don't have to be matchymatchy now with the now with the head i'm gonna add more points and i'm gonna bring it up a little bit my outline i'm gonna start outlining everything in black thickness two now i group the head pieces together and i'm going to try and hide them a little bit by ungrouping and then moving forward and backward i'm going to bring his the bottom piece of his face up a little bit and i'm not going to be super concerned about what the top of his head is gonna look like because i'm gonna delete it so i delete that circle that was just a placer that was just a place mark for me to understand where his little hat was gonna go so now i add a little crinkle in his face and that just makes um a more definition and i'm going to add a little bit more to his smile his smile can be crooked he is sort of again like this evil character so he can have more of an evil smile right now this is before of course he turns super good and saves christmas so let's go ahead and start drawing his eyes i just drew a circle and then i'm going to make several points at the top of my circle and at the bottom of my circle and when i get it to be sort of like um more squarish on the bottom i'm going to fool around i'm going to have a topdown gradient color and then i'm gonna have the colors the two colors be sort of a brownish on top and a whitish on bottom and i just fool around with the colors until i get them just the way i like them and i only have to do one eye because i'm going to copy and paste it to the other side so now i'm going to go ahead and just get little white circles and those will be like my reflection points in my eyes and i do two of them now i'm going to go ahead and make a size 2 little crease in his eye and i'm pretty much done with his eye now i'm going to go ahead and get all my pieces i think there are four pieces i group them copy paste and then flip them horizontal to the other side now he's looking really happy so let's go ahead and put some little naughty eyebrows on him just using our line tool and one little point in the middle so i get a good one then i copy paste flip horizontal and put it to the other side now i'm working with his chin i put it to the back and then using my points tool i'm just gonna go ahead and fool around with his face a little bit more and i made the bottom of his chin stick out a little bit in a point and then i went ahead and made his outline a three on his face i'm gonna keep his smile at two and i bring his little nose down and i'm going to bring a little mouth piece down and then put his nose in front there there we go and i bring his little creases for his face down and i can use the arrow keys on my keyboard just to move the little pieces that i like very very slowly and get them just the way i want them so now he's looking a little bit more knotty okay let's go ahead and try and do his hat so i'm in my brush tool size five black and i'm making hit little curlicues all over the bottom of his head and then the top of his head and i made some little accent marks in there i might keep those i might not and then now with my line tool i did use my brush and i didn't like it so go ahead and use your line tool to make his hat and i just made like a nice curl at the top and then i'm going to make a size 4 or size 5 outline for this line for his hat and i have one like almost upside down v and then one piece that is just almost straight up and then connected to that last point on his hat so it's sort of a slouchy santa hat and it's like sort of cocked to the side now i like to go ahead and just use my brush tool and fill everything in in white for the fluff part but you can use the circle tool and just add extra points and fill it in that way too but i like to paint and you don't have to be very um real super careful with this because you can always pull your outline in front because you made it a separate piece and so i'm just coloring coloring white get all his little pieces down and now i'm going to go ahead and group his hat and i make a bottom so i get those nice three pieces and then i can turn it red and now i'm going to go ahead and move it so it's a little bit less to the side and pull it down so you can see the fluff part instead of that straight line now i'm going to go ahead and move my outline of my fluff part to the front and it can be uneven it's supposed to be like slouchy looking and sort of uneven and i make a little slouchy mark in the corner of the top of his hat so it looks as if it is really angled downwards like you'd have a natural wrinkle there and now i'm going to draw the fluff part um of his hat the end of his hat the tip of it and again i'm just going to go ahead and use my paint tool to just paint it white and i don't have to worry about being perfect because i can go ahead and grab i made a little white reflection point in his hat as well and now i'm going to go ahead and make a little accent point in his white fluff but i can go ahead and grab any of those outlines i want and pull them to the front perfect oh he's looking very evil isn't he let's go ahead and outline his body now i think i'm outlining it in two or three just black i'm going to go ahead and put that arm piece to the back so his belly sticks out and i'm going to adjust the arm he has real skinny little arms or at least in my head he has very skinny little limbs and a bigger belly so i'm going to make him a little fun here i put his points over and just connect that little arm piece and i can go ahead and delete any of the blocks that i made at first because those were just placers those were just fun little reference points that we had oh his arm is looking more like an arm i might even give it like a little bit more shoulder here he's supposed to have sort of weak shoulders so that's why they sort of droop down instead of sticking out okay now i'm going to go ahead and use that marker that block that i have and i'm just going to use my points and draw out like a little point for his fingers i'm not worried about fingers i'm not going to define fingers i just have one little point and i make his wrist thin and it's to the back because he has his hand on his hip there okay now i'm going to go ahead and grab that leg block and i will make it give it some extra points and make it thin and i'm looking anytime i'm not real sure where i'm going i just look at the original drawing that i did and then that gives me sort of an angle now his feet i want to sort of be like a funny shape so he has like an arch in the middle of his foot he has like no distinguishable toes or anything and his heel comes down and there's like an arch and when i like it it's a simple simple leg there's his little knee when i like it i just copy paste flip horizontal and then i'm going to put it back a little bit further so it doesn't exactly match and the arm doesn't exactly match the other arm so they're back a little bit more they're higher on one side than the other just it just makes it a little bit more realistic let's go ahead and work on his body i want him to be plump around the middle but not too plump so i just add extra points to his torso now i give him like a little belly button thing little belly button line it does not have to be perfect now let's go ahead and use our line tool and i'm going to get a series of v's upside down v's and i'm gonna make his little like fun little scruff that i i'm gonna do it in an outline thickness of two and then i'm gonna go ahead and color it a darker olive so if when i get these points that i like i'm just going to copy and paste them because why do extra work when you have copy and paste that's the beautiful thing about computers okay so i'm going to turn that i'm going to get these points i'm going to use shift key copy paste after i've grouped them and then i flip horizontal and then i'll just make some lines to meet up in the middle where i'm missing some okay now i'm going to use my select tool and i'm going to select all of them and then group them and i can try and use my fill a little bit it'll fill it a little bit and then all i have to do is add a circle in the middle and just fool around with extra points in the circle and give it no outline so you see the points outline and i select everything and turn it like a booger shade like a dark yucky greenish same type of shade of his skin except darker because he remember he is an evil character until he turns good we're not supposed to like be in love with him he's supposed to be sort of like this scary monstery type of person creature so now i'm just fooling around with my with my points and i get everything the way i like it and then i hit group and i pull it over voila we're done
