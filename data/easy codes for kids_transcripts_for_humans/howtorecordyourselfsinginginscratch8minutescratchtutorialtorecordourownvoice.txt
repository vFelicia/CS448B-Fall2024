00:00 - hello scratchers welcome back to easy
00:02 - codes for kids
00:03 - okay this is lesson number two where
00:07 - bananas
00:08 - meet apple and bananas
00:12 - is is gonna say something to apple using
00:16 - our voices so we're going to record our
00:18 - own voices and we're going to say
00:20 - hey it's bananas
00:24 - it's so great to be a bunch of bananas
00:26 - or maybe you could tell a joke
00:28 - or sing a song or maybe you could
00:32 - i don't know maybe think of your own
00:35 - script for this
00:36 - okay this is coding isn't it fun isn't
00:39 - it easy
00:40 - we got this come on let's go all right
00:43 - so the very first thing that we want to
00:44 - do is we want to
00:46 - x out our sprite cat so that's this
00:50 - little guy right here so
00:51 - bye-bye okay
00:54 - the next thing that we want to do is we
00:56 - want to go down here in the right hand
00:59 - corner
00:59 - of our screen and this is where we
01:02 - choose a sprite
01:04 - so if i just hover on this little kitty
01:06 - icon right here it
01:08 - changes to the color green and then it
01:10 - says choose a sprite so i'm going to go
01:12 - ahead and click on it
01:14 - and i want to choose my bananas and i
01:16 - want to choose my apple
01:18 - okay so first i click on bananas
01:22 - and there's my sprite bananas right
01:24 - there then i do the same
01:27 - steps so i hover upon choose a sprite
01:31 - i click it and then i choose
01:35 - my apple so there is my bananas

01:42 - gonna
01:43 - move if i want to they're they're sort
01:45 - of like bunched together
01:46 - so i'm gonna go ahead and click on my
01:49 - bananas
01:51 - and i am just gonna hold him
01:54 - hold my mouse down and drag him over a
01:58 - little bit
01:59 - so they each have a nice distance
02:01 - between them
02:03 - okay so i just went ahead and selected
02:06 - and then i can move this anywhere i want
02:09 - but i just want it so they're sort of
02:12 - next to each other but not right on top
02:13 - of each other
02:14 - okay so the next thing that i want to do
02:17 - is
02:18 - for my bananas this is where my code
02:21 - window is right
02:22 - here in the middle and i am going to
02:25 - go ahead and choose my yellow events
02:27 - code
02:28 - and when green flag is clicked
02:32 - that will be my kickoff and that will
02:34 - start all the fun
02:36 - so when green flag is clicked
02:40 - i'm going to pick my pink sound
02:43 - and i am going to come over here
02:47 - and put play sound bite until done
02:51 - but i don't want to play the
02:54 - byte sound i'm going to go ahead and
02:56 - click on this little
02:57 - downward arrow and instead of bite i'm
03:01 - going to go ahead and click

04:05 - bananas okay
04:08 - [Music]
04:10 - all right now let's go ahead
04:14 - and go back into my code so i go into my
04:18 - code
04:18 - tab and now i want to go ahead and
04:22 - instead of play sound
04:23 - bite until done i want to select play
04:27 - go bananas until done
04:30 - now let's go ahead and test this out
04:32 - shall we
04:37 - go bananas go go bananas okay
04:41 - cool um so that is
04:44 - my banana saying go bananas go go
04:46 - bananas let's go ahead and do something
04:48 - similar for our apple
04:50 - so let's click on our apple sprite i can
04:53 - click here or i can click
04:54 - there and then i want to go in here i'm
04:58 - in my code
04:59 - and the first thing that i need to do is
05:01 - tell
05:02 - is to create a kickoff event so i am
05:05 - going to go ahead and pull over my when
05:07 - green flag is clicked
05:09 - the next thing that i want to do is
05:12 - i want to go ahead and create a cool
05:14 - sound for my
05:16 - apple so i go into sound and i'm going
05:24 - to go ahead and pull
05:26 - drag under when green flag is clicked
05:29 - place sound chomp until done now i don't
05:33 - you know where i'm going with this
05:35 - i don't want the chomp sound right i
05:37 - want my
05:38 - own voice so i'm gonna do record
05:44 - and then i'm not recording anything
05:46 - until i hit my red record button
05:49 - so i can tell everybody around me shh
05:51 - i'm gonna record

06:39 - instead of the sound being recording one
06:41 - let's put apples
06:44 - here okay good now let's go back to our
06:47 - code

06:57 - okay the only thing that i'm thinking is
07:00 - and you probably have already caught

07:11 - gonna talk at the same time
07:13 - and i don't want that so what i want to
07:16 - do
07:16 - is let's put a little weight in there
07:20 - so i go into my orange control
07:27 - and i'm going to say
07:33 - when green flag is clicked
07:35 - [Music]
07:36 - wait four seconds and then play my
07:40 - apples recording what do you think do
