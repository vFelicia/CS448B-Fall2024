00:04 - hello
00:05 - it's nice to meet you my name is matt
00:07 - and i am an embedded software engineer
00:10 - which basically means i write software
00:13 - for small devices
00:14 - or devices that are not full-on
00:15 - computers i recently had the idea of
00:18 - creating a simple supposed course for
00:20 - beginners so for people who have never
00:21 - seen
00:22 - code before and want to know how
00:24 - computers work by writing some c plus
00:26 - plus code
00:27 - so this course will entail a lot of the
00:29 - fundamentals that you need
00:30 - in order to program not just in simple
00:32 - explores but in in any other language
00:34 - out there so things like how memory is
00:37 - laid out how you can access memory
00:39 - in your computer and how the program
00:42 - deals with that memory
00:44 - and etc so i'd like to begin by talking
00:46 - a little bit about myself
00:48 - in the first place so i studied computer
00:50 - science
00:51 - at university i graduated with a
00:53 - master's degree in it
00:54 - in 2018. since then
00:57 - i have been writing sible's postcode to
01:00 - develop
01:00 - programs for desktops and more recently
01:02 - i have been writing software for cars
01:05 - in the embedded in the embedded world
01:08 - well prior to that i
01:09 - had used a few different languages as
01:12 - well such as python
01:13 - phd back in the day when i first got
01:15 - started uh
01:17 - and and so on so what i want to
01:20 - sort of show you guys in this course is
01:23 - is the fundamentals the absolute
01:24 - fundamentals that you need
01:26 - in order to pick up any programming
01:27 - language out there and
01:29 - for you guys to understand fundamentally
01:31 - how how a
01:33 - computer program works okay so now that
01:36 - we've got the introduction out of the
01:37 - way
01:37 - let's start talking about the main topic
01:40 - of this video which is setting up your
01:41 - environment so you have all the tools
01:43 - necessary
01:45 - to complete this course yeah so the
01:47 - first thing i'm going to ask you guys
01:48 - to download is something called an ide
01:51 - now ide
01:52 - stands for integrated development
01:54 - environment and it's basically a program
01:56 - that contains all the tools that you
01:58 - need
01:58 - to write code and generate your program
02:01 - out of your code
02:02 - yeah so if you're in windows i would
02:05 - highly recommend
02:06 - using visual studio 2019 because it
02:09 - comes with all the c plus plus compilers
02:10 - that we need it comes with a really good
02:12 - editor
02:13 - and code completion tools as well now
02:16 - visual studio 2019
02:18 - is free the community edition is
02:20 - completely free so you can just go to
02:21 - the website and download it if you're on
02:22 - windows
02:24 - so make sure you do that and you install
02:25 - it
02:27 - now if you're not on windows if you're
02:29 - on if you're on linux
02:30 - or on a mac os machine i could recommend
02:34 - an ide called c lion which is something
02:37 - i use
02:37 - on a daily basis for work on on my linux
02:40 - machine
02:41 - and it is in the same way like visual
02:43 - studios it includes all the tools that
02:45 - you need
02:46 - for writing your code and debugging it
02:47 - and generating programs out of it
02:50 - but unfortunately it's not free for
02:53 - general use
02:54 - it is free for students so if you have a
02:56 - student email with your university or
02:58 - school
02:58 - you can get a free license out of it but
03:00 - if you're not a student like myself
03:02 - i think i'm paying currently something
03:04 - like eight pounds a month
03:06 - which is about nine ten dollars
03:09 - i believe a month for the license but it
03:12 - is worth having
03:13 - if you have no other option so make sure
03:15 - you install this as well if
03:17 - you if you can there is a first a day
03:18 - trial here so you can you can try it out
03:21 - before
03:21 - buying a license if you want okay now
03:24 - the main thing that these ides will
03:26 - include
03:26 - is generally they will include a c plus
03:29 - plus compiler
03:30 - so a c plus plus compiler is a program
03:33 - uh
03:34 - that reads your source code so something
03:36 - that you've got here on the on the right
03:37 - on the left side
03:39 - so this is c plus with source code and
03:41 - that compiler is gonna then
03:43 - generate uh instructions for your cpu
03:46 - for your machine to read because
03:48 - unlike what many people think uh c plus
03:51 - plus code
03:51 - or just programming in general isn't
03:53 - something that the uh
03:55 - the cpu can can understand there's a
03:57 - step in the middle which is actually
03:58 - generating
03:59 - the instructions and that's what the
04:00 - compiler will do you will generate
04:02 - here what's on the right and this this
04:04 - on the right here is what your
04:06 - computer actually understands and can
04:08 - execute yeah so this is what a compiler
04:10 - does
04:11 - and you should get that for free with
04:13 - visual studio
04:14 - however i think c line if you don't have
04:16 - a compiler installed
04:17 - on your on your machine already you have
04:19 - to install it manually okay
04:22 - by the way i do have an article about
04:25 - how to
04:26 - install um something called cmake on my
04:30 - website i'm going to be linking it on
04:31 - the description
04:32 - and there is a subsection here about how
04:34 - you can install a compiler on your
04:36 - machine if you're on linux
04:37 - if you're interested so make sure you
04:38 - check the link out okay
04:40 - now the final tool that you're going to
04:42 - need is cmake
04:44 - and cmake is a build system generator
04:48 - and what that basically means is that
04:50 - you can tell the computer you can tell
04:52 - your your ides
04:53 - in fact how your project is structured
04:56 - so you will tell the ids where your
04:57 - source files are located what programs
04:59 - you're generating out of them and what
05:01 - libraries you're using
05:02 - and etc okay i do have an article on my
05:05 - website again this is i'm going to link
05:06 - it on the description
05:07 - it explains in a simple manner
05:10 - um everything about cmake so everything
05:13 - that you need to know for now
05:14 - uh about cmake okay so now um
05:17 - if you went for the c lion option so
05:19 - you've installed c line on your on your
05:20 - linux machine
05:21 - or mac os or even on windows because it
05:23 - has support for windows as well
05:25 - that comes automatically free for you
05:28 - you don't have to install
05:29 - anything else okay that it comes with
05:31 - cmake however if you went for the visual
05:33 - studio is
05:34 - installation and you selected the basic
05:37 - cpu suppose desktop
05:39 - development option on the installation
05:41 - page
05:42 - then there is something extra you need
05:43 - to do and that's something extra is
05:45 - actually installing
05:46 - cmx support for visual studio which is
05:48 - not too hard all you got to do is
05:50 - go on your taskbar look for visual
05:53 - studio installer
05:55 - as you can see here this this this
05:57 - program here you should have it
05:59 - installed already if you installed
06:00 - visual studio 2019 and this is basically
06:02 - where you manage
06:03 - all the add-ons for visual studio yeah
06:06 - so to do that you can click on modify
06:09 - on the visual studio option there and
06:11 - you're going to go on individual
06:12 - components and to install the cmake
06:15 - support you're going to look for c plus
06:17 - c make support i believe
06:19 - or something like that there you go c
06:20 - plus plus c make tools for windows
06:23 - you're going to check this box here and
06:25 - there will be a button called
06:26 - install you're going to click on that
06:27 - and just wait for the installation to be
06:29 - done
06:29 - and you're good to go okay in my case
06:32 - i've already got that installed so
06:33 - obviously it's not here and that's it
06:37 - for this video
06:39 - now if you've followed everything that
06:40 - i've mentioned here you should have all
06:42 - the tools that you need to follow the
06:43 - course
06:44 - okay and i'm going to leave it here in
06:46 - the next video i plan to be teaching you
06:48 - guys how to write
06:49 - the simplest c plus plus program with
06:52 - the simplest c
06:53 - make and get you your ide to compile
06:56 - that
06:56 - and and run the program for you okay so
06:59 - if you've got any
07:00 - any comments if you've got any feedback
07:02 - please feel free to comment on the video
07:05 - i will make sure that i reply to every
07:07 - every single one of the
07:08 - the questions i get at least the star of
07:11 - this course
07:11 - um thanks for watching and bye
