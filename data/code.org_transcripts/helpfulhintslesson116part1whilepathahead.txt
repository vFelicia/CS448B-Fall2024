00:00 - this puzzle might look a lot harder than
00:02 - what you're used to but if you say it
00:04 - out loud it's really not that difficult
00:08 - it is a rectangle so at first it looks
00:11 - like we might need to do something
00:12 - different for the long sides than for
00:15 - the short sides
00:16 - but if you look closely you'll see that
00:19 - we have a wild path ahead block here
00:23 - that means that while there's a path
00:25 - ahead we can move forward checking for
00:28 - flowers and getting nectar what do we do
00:30 - when we get to the end of the path
00:33 - how many times do we need to repeat that
00:36 - i know you can figure it out good luck
