00:07 - Animated movies create the impression
that characters are moving smoothly, but
00:11 - if you slow them down enough, you'll
realize there are lots of individual images.
00:16 - Each image is just a little bit
different from the one before.
00:20 - Speed them back up, and your eyes are tricked into thinking you're watching real life motion.
00:25 - A very simple example of this
effect is a flip book.
00:29 - The key to animation, whether on paper, or the computer, is that part of the drawing is changing over time.
00:36 - An easy way to achieve a change is to use the random
00:39 - number command to generate a new random location, size, or color for the shape we're drawing.
00:46 - Here is a simple program
that draws a single rectangle with a
00:50 - random 'X' position and a random 'Y' position.
00:53 - If we run and reset this program over and over again, we can see that it draws the rectangle in a new position each time.
01:01 - But that's like a flip book with only one page!
01:04 - To create real animations, we need to be able to string these pages of the flip book together.
01:10 - In Game Lab, we'll do this using
the 'draw function'.
01:14 - The 'draw function' is special in Game Lab.
01:17 - The commands inside of the 'draw function' are run line by line from top to bottom,
01:21 - but once the
computer reaches the end of the commands
01:24 - inside the draw function, it jumps back
to the beginning and repeats the
01:27 - commands over and over again as long as your program is running.
01:32 - Because the code in the draw function repeats in a loop,
we'll just refer to this as the 'draw loop'
01:39 - Let's move our rectangle inside the 'draw
loop' and see what happens.
01:44 - WHOA, so many rectangles!
01:47 - We can see that a rectangle isn't just being drawn once anymore!
01:51 - Game lab is automatically calling the commands inside of the draw loop many times a second.
01:56 - In this program, that
means that a new random 'X' and 'Y' location is
02:00 - generated and then a rectangle is drawn
over and over and over.
02:06 - You can place as many commands as you like inside of the draw function.
02:10 - For example, let's choose a
02:11 - new fill color before drawing each rectangle by placing a fill command inside the 'draw loop'.
02:16 - Instead of always choosing the
same color, we'll randomize by replacing
02:20 - the red value with the random number
command.
02:23 - So in every frame of the flip book, the computer is picking a new shade of red and setting that as the fill color.
02:29 - Then it picks a new 'X' and 'Y'
value and draws a rectangle with those values.
02:35 - In a typical animated movie or
flip book, you don't continue to see all
02:38 - of the drawings that came earlier in the
animation.
02:41 - Instead you have the illusion of a single shape or character moving over time.
02:46 - You'll discover how to make that happen with the 'draw loop' soon.
