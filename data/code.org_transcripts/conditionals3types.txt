00:07 - this is a conditional block
00:10 - the code inside a conditional block runs
00:13 - if a condition is true
00:16 - in puzzles with conditionals we might
00:18 - want to check a condition like if path
00:20 - ahead
00:22 - this code will only move forward if
00:24 - there is a path ahead
00:26 - you can use conditionals in lots of
00:28 - different ways like this
00:31 - or this
00:34 - what if you want something else to
00:35 - happen if a condition is false
00:39 - you can use an if-else block for that
00:42 - this code will move forward
00:44 - if there is a path ahead
00:46 - otherwise it will turn left
00:48 - your code will either move forward or
00:51 - turn left but never both
00:53 - this is helpful if you want your code to
00:55 - make decisions based on certain
00:57 - conditions
00:58 - here are some more ways you can use
01:00 - conditionals in if-else blocks
01:04 - if you want to add more conditions to
01:06 - your block you can do that with a block
01:08 - that looks like this
01:10 - this block will check two conditions
01:12 - with this code if the score is equal to
01:15 - 5 the actor will say you have 5 points
01:18 - otherwise if the score is equal to 10
01:21 - the actor will say you have 10 points
01:24 - otherwise the actor will say get more
01:26 - points
01:27 - remember only one set of instructions
01:30 - will run
01:31 - if you're ready let's give it a try
01:40 - you
