00:00 - inside the blocks we've been using are
00:02 - javascript commands
00:04 - javascript is the most popular software
00:06 - language for professional developers
00:07 - today
00:09 - blocks are a great way to get started
00:11 - learning to code and in fact top
00:13 - universities like harvard and berkeley
00:14 - start teaching this way
00:16 - but once we've learned the basics
00:18 - engineers write code by typing because
00:20 - it allows us to go faster
00:22 - we can type hundreds of commands without
00:25 - having to find them in the toolbox or
00:26 - drag them out
00:28 - because you're learning typing may be
00:30 - slower at first but we wanted you to
00:31 - give it a try
00:33 - in the upper right corner on your
00:35 - workspace you can click the show text
00:37 - button on any puzzle to switch from
00:39 - blocks to typing code as text
00:42 - in the next lesson we'll start you out
00:44 - in typing mode
00:45 - here you can still drag the block from
00:47 - the toolbox or you can type the command
00:49 - name
00:50 - as you start to type you'll see names of
00:52 - possible commands show below where
00:54 - you're typing
00:55 - instead of typing the whole command name
00:58 - you can select one of these to move
01:00 - faster
01:01 - in my job i use this autocomplete
01:03 - feature all the time when writing code
01:06 - when you're typing code the computer
01:08 - needs you to be very precise you need to
01:10 - spell and capitalize the command name
01:12 - exactly correctly including the
01:14 - parentheses and the semicolon
01:17 - even with a small typing mistake bb8
01:19 - cannot understand the code and won't be
01:22 - able to move
01:23 - when you make an error on the line the
01:25 - editor highlights it for you so that you
01:27 - can try changing your text to fix it
01:30 - if you get stuck you can always start
01:32 - over with the start over button and you
01:33 - can switch back to block mode at any
01:35 - time by clicking in the top right corner
01:38 - okay let's give typing a try
01:41 - and if you make mistakes don't get
01:43 - frustrated it takes everyone a few tries
01:45 - to get it right
