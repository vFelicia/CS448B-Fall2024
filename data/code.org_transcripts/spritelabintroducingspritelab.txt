00:07 - My name is Lesley Torres and I am a
computer science student.
00:12 - What I like about computer science is that
00:14 - it helps me develop my creativity
00:16 - and it also teaches me problem-solving skills.
00:22 - This is Sprite Lab,
00:24 - a place where you can build imaginative and fun
00:27 - apps and other useful programs.
00:30 - This is a sprite!
00:33 - A sprite is something you can interact
with
00:35 - like a character in the game or an object in the scene.
00:39 - With Sprite Lab you can change different aspects of a sprite
00:43 - like it's costume, location and color.
00:48 - You can also change how is sprite behaves on the screen.
00:51 - Sprites can also interact with
you or each other.
00:55 - You can create a dance party,
00:58 - a virtual pet,
01:00 - or an entire world of creatures that do
01:02 - whatever you tell them to.
01:05 - Now you can spend some time exploring Sprite Lab
01:08 - and see where your imagination leads you!
