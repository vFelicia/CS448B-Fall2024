00:07 - now you're going to start creating your
00:09 - own video game
00:10 - as with most video games you won't have
00:13 - to start from scratch you'll be building
00:15 - your game on top of some existing code
00:17 - called an engine which will take care of
00:19 - a lot of the heavy lifting for you
00:22 - most modern video games are also built
00:24 - on engines which allow the programmers
00:26 - to build better games faster
00:29 - you'll be writing the logic that
00:30 - controls how all of the characters in
00:33 - your game look
00:34 - move and interact with each other
00:37 - and the game engine will take care of
00:39 - displaying your creation on screen
00:42 - animating your characters
00:44 - and keeping track of your score
00:46 - in the first stage you're going to
00:48 - modify the variables in the game by
00:50 - substituting your own title
00:53 - background and images for your sprites
00:56 - just click edit to edit the variable
01:00 - then save and close to save your
01:01 - modification
01:03 - and finally hit run to see your new game
01:06 - in action
01:08 - if something doesn't look like what you
01:10 - expected try troubleshooting your game
01:13 - troubleshooting also known as debugging
01:15 - is when a programmer systematically
01:17 - examines the code to determine the
01:19 - source of the unexpected results
01:22 - you can troubleshoot your game by
01:24 - opening the function of the variable
01:25 - that didn't do what you wanted it to do
01:28 - check did you modify the variable
01:30 - correctly
01:32 - have fun changing the variables of your
01:33 - big game
