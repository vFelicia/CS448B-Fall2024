00:08 - the songwriting lesson and the
00:10 - songwriting with parameters lesson are
00:12 - very closely tied together if you're
00:14 - teaching songwriting with parameters you
00:16 - can teach songwriting first to refresh
00:18 - everybody's memory and then it should
00:20 - all flow the way you're about to see in
00:22 - the video if you're only teaching
00:24 - songwriting go ahead and skip the second
00:26 - part but it's very possible that someone
00:28 - will ask about differences and choruses
00:30 - and then you can go ahead and teach them
00:32 - the parameters part as well okay so how
00:38 - many of you have ever looked up lyrics
00:40 - to any song alright so you're probably
00:44 - used to having them written down
00:46 - something like this so has anybody ever
00:50 - heard this song before ideally this
00:53 - would be a song that you guys kind of
00:55 - know but it sounds like the majority of
00:57 - you guys don't know this song so I'm
00:59 - gonna teach you the chorus okay so the
01:02 - chorus have have any of you heard of the
01:04 - chorus of a song when you're looking up
01:06 - lyrics you have the chorus of a song
01:07 - right so the chorus goes I'm Annette I'm
01:12 - Anna I'm Anna I'm Anna I'm a nut can you
01:15 - guys do that with me okay that was very
01:23 - good so now we're gonna take it from
01:26 - here here we go
02:19 - okay very good all right
02:23 - so we went through the lyrics why when
02:27 - it said chorus here why didn't you sing
02:29 - that is why I'm cracked you see chorus
02:47 - okay so what you're saying is that we
02:52 - are singing all this because it's
02:53 - written down but when we say chorus
02:56 - we're really referring back to the thing
02:59 - we already defined earlier right we gave
03:03 - this thing a name and that name was and
03:06 - so now anytime we wanted to use this
03:09 - chunk instead of writing it all over and
03:12 - over and over again
03:13 - all we had to do is put the word very
03:18 - good so you could take verse one and
03:30 - define it over here take verse two and
03:33 - define it over here and verse three over
03:36 - here and then you'd write your program
03:38 - by saying verse one chorus verse two
03:42 - chorus verse three chorus very good
03:47 - alright does everybody get how you
03:49 - define a course and use it later
03:54 - okay so now you guys are saying well
03:58 - what if something's kind of different
04:00 - right what if something a little
04:02 - different in the chorus and we want to
04:04 - call with one thing and then with
04:06 - another thing we could just make two
04:07 - different courses all there really is in
04:10 - Old MacDonald is choruses you just sing
04:13 - the same course over and over but you
04:16 - have to change the words so if you were
04:18 - gonna sing all MacDonald's with all your
04:20 - favorite animals you'd have to have 12
04:22 - different courses right that wouldn't
04:24 - save you any writing in fact it might be
04:26 - more writing than you need so what we're
04:29 - doing is we're we're introducing
04:32 - something called a parameter can us a
04:35 - parameter parameter so you probably have
04:40 - noticed the word parameter on our word
04:42 - wall but this is what it actually means
04:47 - it's an extra little bit of information
04:49 - that you want to pass through so that
04:52 - you know what to sing in the chorus
04:54 - because it can change in the chorus so
04:59 - here we're gonna have animal so on his
05:03 - farm he had an animal but are we
05:07 - actually gonna sing animal we need to
05:12 - know which animal we're gonna substitute
05:15 - for the word animal and then whatever's
05:18 - first because animal is first whatever's
05:22 - first is going to become animal and
05:25 - whatever second is gonna become sound
05:30 - very good so let's try this let's try
05:34 - singing the song exactly the way it's
05:36 - written chorus pig oink chorus cow mooo
05:40 - chorus chicken Bock is that is that
05:43 - really what they meant for me to say no
05:47 - so what I want you to do now that you
05:49 - understand the definition when it's
05:53 - called
05:54 - with its parameters I want you to see if
05:59 - your brain automatically knows what
06:01 - you're actually supposed to sing okay
06:03 - here's your test are you ready
06:07 - Old MacDonald job guys
06:50 - so what were some things you notice
06:52 - after you were done going all the way
06:54 - through it called chorus so you went all
06:57 - the way through chorus and then what did
06:59 - you do you went to the next line down in
07:04 - the program right and then you did it
07:06 - again and then you went to the next line
07:08 - down in the program and you did it again
07:10 - and then you got back and there was
07:12 - nothing left in the program so you
07:14 - stopped so that's exactly what a
07:18 - computer does when you have a function
07:21 - and there's a function that you've
07:23 - defined somewhere else and you said hey
07:26 - whenever I say this word I really want
07:29 - you to go do all this stuff so I'm only
07:33 - going to type this cuz I got better
07:36 - things to do but you are gonna run all
07:39 - of this oh and because it changes a lot
07:43 - I'm just gonna let you know what I want
07:45 - these special words to become so all I
07:48 - have to do is this and you're gonna do
07:51 - all the work for me
07:53 - that's functions with parameters okay
08:02 - but we don't have to because a computer
08:05 - inside just a computer's programming it
08:08 - understands it's already been told that
08:12 - these are the way we tell you things
08:15 - later so we don't have to do that as
08:17 - part of this one program because the
08:20 - master program that makes the computer
08:22 - run at all has already told it that's a
08:24 - really good question
