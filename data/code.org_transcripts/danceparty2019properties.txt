00:08 - My name is Maria, I'm a junior at the
University of Washington,
00:13 - and I'm an Amazon future engineer.
00:16 - I love computer science because it incorporates problem-solving
00:20 - and critical thinking, and after putting hours of work into something,
00:24 - you can get something really cool and rewarding out of it.
00:32 - So far, you've had a chance to play with some different types of dancers,
00:37 - and you've programmed them to do different types of dance moves.
00:41 - But how do these moves really work?
00:44 - Every dance move is made up of a series of images called frames.
00:48 - Each frame is slightly different from the one before it.
00:52 - When your program runs, your computer shows one frame after another.
00:56 - They're shown so fast, that it looks like the dancer is moving.
01:00 - This is the secret behind all animation.
01:03 - Not only can you change a dancers moves, you can also change
01:07 - a dancer's properties. Properties describe things like the dancer's position on the screen,
01:13 - the dancer's size, and the dancer's color.
01:20 - To change the properties of a dancer, you'll use a Set block.
01:24 - Let's use a Set block to make our dancers look smaller.
01:28 - First, drag the set block into your
program. Then select a dancer you'd like
01:34 - to change, and type in the size they will appear on-screen.
01:50 - Full-size is 100.
01:56 - If you choose a lower number, that will make the dancers smaller.
02:02 - The smaller the dancer is, the
further away it looks.
02:10 - Using the Set block, you can also change a dancer's
dimensions, rotation, position, and color.
02:21 - By playing around with these properties
you can make all kinds of changes,
02:24 - and link them to different parts of the song.
02:28 - Remember, you can only set the properties of a dancer that already exists.
02:34 - Make sure that your Set block, comes after the Make A New Dancer block.
02:38 - Feel free to experiment, be creative, and have fun.
