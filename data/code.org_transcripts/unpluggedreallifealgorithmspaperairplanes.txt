00:00 - Unplugged Activity | Real Life Algorithms:
Paper Airplanes
00:07 - This lesson is called Real Life Algorithms.
00:10 - Algorithms describe things
that people do everyday. Cookie recipes and
00:15 - directions for building a birdhouse are both
everyday algorithms. Today we're gonna make,
00:20 - create, and test an algorithm for a paper
airplane. But first, we need to break this
00:27 - big project into easy to follow small steps.
For making a paper airplane, we need to decide
00:32 - what steps to take and in what order to take
them. You'll create your algorithm by first
00:37 - cutting apart the pictures. Next, you'll select
the 6 pictures that show the steps needed
00:42 - to make a paper airplane and arrange those
pictures in the correct order. After you have
00:47 - everything in order, you will trade algorithms
with another student team to test out the
00:52 - algorithm to see if the algorithm works. A
well designed algorithm is super important
00:57 - to making the best paper airplane.
01:06 - When we want to make chocolate, there are many big
01:10 - steps to that process. And each of those big
steps has its own set of smaller steps. And
01:15 - there are different recipes, or algorithms,
depending on how we want the chocolate to
01:19 - taste. Each step is important, even the small
ones. So without one step, the rest of them
01:23 - cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that
others can understand is really important.
01:30 - That's why each step has to be written down,
so no matter who does it, the result is the same.
