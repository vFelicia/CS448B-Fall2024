00:05 - debugging is finding and fixing problems
00:08 - there are lots of ways to debug problems
00:11 - one of the easiest is to move step by
00:13 - step until you find where something goes
00:15 - wrong
00:17 - here i'm trying to do a back handspring
00:20 - on the beam but i keep falling off
00:24 - i walked through each part step by step
00:26 - and realized where my mistake was
00:29 - i wasn't putting my hands on the beam
00:31 - correctly
00:32 - so i tried another back handspring on
00:34 - the beam with my new hand position and i
00:36 - got it
00:37 - i was really glad i debugged my back
00:39 - handspring
00:42 - to learn about debugging we start out
00:44 - with a set of blocks already on the
00:46 - stage
00:47 - you'll notice that these blocks won't
00:49 - get you to the goal
00:50 - so we need to debug this solution and
00:52 - fix it
00:56 - what went wrong you'll notice that you
00:58 - needed to keep going west one more block
01:01 - so let's fix this by adding another west
01:03 - block
01:05 - and hitting run to see if you got it
01:07 - right
01:13 - yay you got it
