00:07 - let's get back into the video game that
00:09 - you started working on earlier
00:11 - this time we're going to add animation
00:13 - to your game by writing functions to
00:15 - animate the target and danger sprites
00:19 - functions are a key part of animation in
00:21 - computer programs
00:23 - a function that draws a static picture
00:25 - of your danger for example
00:27 - can place the sprite at a different
00:29 - location based on the input
00:31 - when that input changes slightly based
00:33 - on time or user interaction the sprite
00:36 - will appear to move
00:38 - this is similar to the way that flipbook
00:41 - animations work in which each page draws
00:44 - a static image that has changed by a
00:46 - small amount
00:48 - when the pages are displayed quickly the
00:50 - images appear to change smoothly
00:53 - to make the target and danger sprites
00:55 - move across the screen you will modify
00:57 - the update target and update danger
01:00 - functions
01:01 - these functions will take in the current
01:04 - x-coordinate of each sprite
01:06 - and return a new x-coordinate that is
01:08 - either greater than the previous
01:10 - x-coordinate if it wants to move from
01:12 - left to right
01:13 - or less than the previous x-coordinate
01:16 - if it wants to move from right to left
01:19 - at the end of this stage your target in
01:22 - danger should move across the screen but
01:24 - never return
01:25 - that's a problem for another day
