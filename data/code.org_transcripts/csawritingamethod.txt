00:10 - hi i'm jevon and i'm a computer science
00:13 - student at university of washington what
00:15 - first drew me to computer science is
00:17 - just the sheer amount of
00:21 - innovation that the field has
00:23 - there's just a lot going on at any given
00:26 - time and depending on what you choose to
00:28 - do you can make groundbreaking
00:30 - discoveries in
00:32 - many many fields
00:33 - so that really just like keeps me
00:35 - motivated to keep on learning and just
00:37 - do as much as i can
00:40 - so i got a brand new robot but it only
00:43 - knows how to move forward and turn left
00:46 - i want to teach my robot how to move in
00:48 - a square
00:49 - the robot should do this whenever i give
00:51 - it the command square
00:53 - we write methods to represent commands
00:55 - that we can give objects in our programs
00:58 - to write a new method in a class we
01:00 - first have to write the method signature
01:03 - a method signature consists of a name
01:06 - and a parameter list
01:08 - let's write a square method in our robot
01:10 - class
01:11 - we want the method to be accessible by
01:12 - the whole program so we'll start with
01:15 - the keyword public
01:16 - the next part of the method signature
01:18 - specifies what the method should return
01:21 - in this case the square method should
01:23 - perform an action and not return a value
01:26 - so let's add the keyword void
01:29 - this indicates that the method has no
01:30 - return value
01:32 - next we'll state the name of the method
01:35 - then we need to decide if this method
01:37 - will have any parameters
01:39 - the square method does not need any
01:41 - parameters so we'll just write empty
01:43 - parentheses
01:44 - we'll open a set of curly braces to
01:46 - indicate the block of code that should
01:48 - run when this method is called
01:50 - inside of the curly braces we'll write
01:52 - our code to move in a square
01:54 - so we'll move forward and then turn left
01:57 - until we've moved into a square
02:00 - let's create a robot object called
02:02 - myrobot
02:03 - we can use our new square method to have
02:05 - my robot
02:08 - move in a square
02:10 - as many times as we'd like
02:13 - [Music]
02:15 - you can write your own methods to give a
02:17 - name to a command you can use these
02:19 - methods as many times as you need and it
02:22 - saves you the hassle of having to
02:23 - rewrite code every time
