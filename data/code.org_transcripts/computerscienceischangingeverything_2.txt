00:02 - Computer Science is Changing Everything
00:09 - I think the 19th century was about the Industrial
00:12 - Revolution, about electricity, about disrupting
the agricultural society and making it more
00:18 - advanced. The 20th century was about physics
and engineering to do more things easier in
00:24 - our everyday life from refrigerators to washing
machines. And the 21st century is definitely
00:32 - the digital age. It's the Internet.
00:41 - Even if you want to become a race car driver or play
00:45 - baseball or build a house, all of these things
have been turned upside down by software.
00:53 - AGRICULTURE
00:55 - The lettucebot is a robot that can 
sense its environment. Every single
01:01 - hour this lettucebot is seeing 1.5 million
plants, and it's taking individual action
01:07 - on those plants. We enable lettuce growers
to have higher yields in their field by helping
01:12 - make it cheaper, by helping produce food in
a more sustainable way, and that wasn't previously
01:18 - possible without computer science and technology.
01:22 - FASHION
01:23 - I have a really fun job where we built Polyvore,
01:26 - which kind of combine all my favorite things, so programming, as well
01:30 - as fashion, art, design, and shopping! Half
the products you use these days are software
01:38 - products that you play with on your phone
and so if you want to build something cool
01:42 - you need to know programming. There's so many
things you can do with computer science so
01:46 - if you just work backwards from the cool thing
you want to build and you figure out what
01:50 - that is, a lot of times computer programming
is part of that. So you should learn this skill.
01:57 - MEDICINE
01:59 - It's really exciting right
now, the technology that we're developing
02:03 - right now is going to be used by your doctor
in the next decade. When you come into the
02:09 - office and you're sick, the doctor is going
to ask you to spit in this cup. I will put
02:16 - it into this magic machine which is a sequencer
and in an hour I can tell you what you have
02:22 - or what's wrong with you. So if we're looking
for a new virus, for example, we'll download
02:27 - a database of all the viruses that are known.
We'll search for our sequence of interest
02:34 - against a whole database of all viruses. So
you still need somebody to analyze the data;
02:40 - the computer is not smart enough yet.
02:43 - ENERGY
02:45 - Our software helps people save energy
02:47 - and thereby reduce their carbon emissions.
Today, we've saved over 8 terawatt hours,
02:52 - which is the equivalent of about 1.1 million
cars on the road. When you're forecasting
02:58 - the wind there are so many different parameters
that go into it, it would be impossible for
03:02 - a human to sit down and do all those calculations.
We need a computer model in order to forecast it.
03:10 - PUBLIC SAFETY
03:13 - Most people don't
think about technology and public safety as
03:16 - going together, but our software is actually
changing the way that law enforcement is capturing,
03:21 - transfering and managing the digital evidence on daily basis. Turns out that when offices
03:26 - are wearing our cameras they see a drastic
reduction in use of force as well as a drastic
03:32 - reduction in the amount of complaints being
leveraged against their agency, ultimately
03:36 - resulting in safer communities.
03:38 - ART AND ENTERTAINMENT
03:40 - The merging of art and technology
03:41 - is getting more and more significant now.
Because computers and software are such an
03:46 - integral part of our lives day to day, people
are realizing that it can be quite creative
03:51 - to take this medium of computers and create
incredible works of art. In Finding Nemo,
03:58 - when Crush and Squirt and all their friends
are flying through the East Australian Current,
04:03 - you're seeing images of water flowing by,
you're seeing the colors on the back of the
04:08 - turtle, you're seeing the sides of the fish,
all of those things are generated through
04:13 - math and computer programs that we write that
we then give to the artist and they take that
04:18 - to create that final image and to tweak it
and make it look beautiful and look fun. The
04:24 - crux of it is really about invention. It's
about looking at the world and being dissatisfied
04:29 - with things and questioning everything. I
always felt like if I didn't learn how to
04:33 - program it would be like not learning how
to read. The future would just be closed to
04:38 - me. If you're in the coding profession, there's
so many things that you can do and you can
04:44 - pretty much pick and choose the course you
want to be in. Think that you can start something
04:50 - in your college dorm room and you can have
a set of people who haven't built a big company
04:55 - before come together and build something that
a billion people use as part of their daily
05:00 - lives is just crazy to think about. It's really
humbling and amazing. Really it's about the
05:05 - chance to reinvent things and see it out
there in the world and see people using it
05:09 - and having fun or having a better life because
of something that wasn't there before that
05:13 - you put in the world.
05:14 - Learn computer science,
it's changing everything.
