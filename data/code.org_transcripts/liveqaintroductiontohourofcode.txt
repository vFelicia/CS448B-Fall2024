00:00 - hello and welcome to the first ever hour
00:03 - of code code org google hangout on air
00:06 - this is a new technology that we're
00:09 - trying out as a way of reaching all of
00:12 - the great organizers who are helping
00:13 - tribute to making our coded big
00:15 - successes here we have 50 viewers so far
00:18 - so if you're one of them that's great
00:19 - we're going to start in about 30 seconds
00:22 - all the way for a few more people to
00:23 - join in I just want to say there's this
00:25 - question and answer application on the
00:27 - side of the screen and while we're going
00:29 - on while we're we're giving the first
00:32 - few minutes worth of introductions and
00:34 - background feel free to contribute
00:36 - questions of anything you're interested
00:38 - in learning about if someone's already
00:40 - asked a question and you want to sort of
00:41 - second it this little plus button you
00:43 - can click we will be answering the
00:45 - questions in the order of whichever ones
00:47 - get the most pluses I'm working our way
00:49 - down so thank you for all of you guys
00:52 - are checking in unfortunate is not a
00:54 - great way to chat here so let's try to
00:56 - keep the questions to actual questions
00:58 - for conducting the hour of code and
01:00 - although I do appreciate all the
01:03 - enthusiasm and passion we're seeing from
01:05 - from from any of you so with that I'm
01:09 - actually going to start by turning it
01:10 - over to the executive director of the
01:12 - code org organization and also founder
01:14 - of this whole ablation in movement how
01:17 - deep are Toby hi hi everybody I had no
01:25 - idea when we launched the first code org
01:27 - video featuring Mark Zuckerberg and Bill
01:29 - Gates and Jack Dorsey what a amazing
01:31 - reception there would be you know 20
01:33 - million views later and thirteen
01:36 - thousand schools asking us for help
01:37 - later at this project has grown too much
01:40 - much bigger than I would have expected
01:41 - and what's been especially amazing is
01:46 - with the hour of code movement you know
01:48 - it was literally an idea that got
01:50 - hatched about three months ago and and
01:53 - four weeks after announcing it it's now
01:55 - already on track to be the largest
01:56 - education event in history with you know
02:00 - with 1.9 million kids already signed up
02:02 - to do it and that the current rate of
02:04 - growth were were well on track to each 3
02:06 - million kids by the time CS Education
02:08 - Week comes around so we're really
02:10 - excited about it and you
02:13 - the biggest message I want to say is at
02:16 - the point of the hour of code campaign
02:17 - isn't necessarily to grow computer
02:20 - scientists or to get people ready to
02:21 - jump into computer science as a major or
02:23 - deaf jobs or whatnot it's just to get
02:26 - people introduced just to understand
02:27 - what is this thing about and to help
02:29 - them realize that anybody can do it
02:31 - everybody can do it and especially that
02:34 - it's not just for white men that girls
02:37 - can do it that Latinas can do it
02:40 - afternoon Americans could do it you know
02:42 - basically want to create a sense of
02:43 - community and together and that's that
02:45 - everybody in the world is trying this
02:47 - thing the skill that is not taught in
02:48 - our schools so more important than
02:51 - anything else is to basically emphasize
02:53 - the inclusiveness when when going to
02:55 - this process and this sort of through
03:00 - the actual hour of code and then that
03:03 - interest one thing in games isn't going
03:05 - to say at the end of this talk and I'll
03:06 - say at the beginning is you know if
03:08 - you're hosting an hour of code and
03:09 - you're excited about it please recruit
03:11 - one other organizer teacher or host to
03:13 - do the same thing if the it's a 10,000
03:16 - people who have already signed up to
03:17 - host it each recruit one other person
03:19 - will reach 5 million kids which is even
03:22 - more impressive than where we already I
03:23 - have that all said James gonna come back
03:26 - to walk through some more details ok
03:28 - thank you honey later my name is James
03:31 - Bergstrom the chief evangelist here at
03:33 - code.org and I've been helping organize
03:34 - a lot of the information materials
03:37 - around the hour of code exercise itself
03:39 - and so we're going to you today is we're
03:41 - going to go through some of the steps
03:42 - needed to actually set up and run the
03:45 - hour of code itself at your school my
03:47 - comms only be a few minutes and then
03:48 - we'll turn it over to the questions so
03:50 - let me go over here and do a screen
03:52 - capture I want to start the single
03:54 - biggest question we get from everyone is
03:56 - people asking how do I see the actual
04:00 - tutorials what are the tutorials and so
04:02 - let me quickly jump over and show that's
04:04 - going to look like so if I do a screen
04:05 - share here and I go to this web page so
04:14 - okay so
04:16 - it is right yes so this URL because CS
04:23 - Edwin org slash learn to this URL is the
04:29 - public beta preview of all of these
04:32 - tutorials that we're going to be
04:34 - offering during the out for the hour of
04:37 - code during sales education week and
04:39 - they're grouped into different
04:41 - categories not all the tutorials in here
04:43 - a final many of the two tools here are
04:45 - in still a beta state that are not
04:46 - completely finished and in fact there
04:48 - are some tutorials on here that might
04:49 - not be on here it will need funded alive
04:51 - and there might be some tutorials not on
04:53 - here that will be on there when we find
04:55 - a go live but this is a good starting
04:56 - point and you can see that we've got it
04:58 - organized by category we've got
04:59 - tutorials for beginners we have
05:01 - tutorials for teachers and schools with
05:04 - no computers at all these are so called
05:05 - unplugged tutorials that you can do with
05:08 - no computer all we have some slightly
05:10 - more advanced tutorials does it actually
05:12 - teach JavaScript an actual programming
05:15 - language that looks like what people
05:16 - often think code is with with text
05:18 - tutorials for any device including
05:21 - things like iPhones iPads Android phones
05:24 - and so forth and find tutorials that
05:27 - create actual apps for devices like
05:30 - phones and finally other various
05:32 - learning options each of these
05:34 - categories has several different
05:36 - tutorials inside of it so for example
05:38 - this patrol here if you're wondering if
05:40 - your teacher wondering I don't want to
05:42 - do my own research I just want a single
05:45 - tutorial which one should I do this is
05:48 - one you should do is the one that we
05:49 - built ourselves here at code.org it is a
05:52 - if they polished a relatively easy to
05:56 - use graphical way of learning people
05:58 - sites and also take you into in a second
06:00 - show what it looks like but there are
06:01 - others there's this one there is scratch
06:04 - which is created a builder holiday card
06:06 - tutorial Khan Academy's created very
06:09 - similar induction of JavaScript and so
06:11 -  song so the number of ones you
06:13 - can go through here and try it out what
06:15 - i'm gonna do i'm going to quickly show
06:16 - you what this looks like and then we
06:18 - will come back to mother house so if you
06:20 - could go it will take you in jersey
06:23 - shore GTL the video and it takes you
06:26 - into the to talk self and in this
06:28 - tutorial for example
06:29 - students will be moving these blocks and
06:32 - graphical blocks around to create a
06:34 - program to solve a series of simple
06:37 - trouble and we start off very simple
06:41 - they get more complicated and along the
06:43 - way students learning the actual
06:45 - concepts of computer science so even
06:47 - though it makes you later playing a game
06:48 - by the time they're done going through
06:50 - these 28 puzzles as part of the hour of
06:52 - code they will have learned some basic
06:54 - principles of computer science they'll
06:55 - have learned about four loops if
06:58 - statements the notion that a program is
07:00 - simply a series of commands like a
07:01 - recipe the computer doesn't order they
07:04 - learned how literal computers can be and
07:06 - has sometimes you know your first
07:08 - program doesn't always work and use
07:09 - often debug it go through several times
07:11 - and that is a very simple tutorial which
07:14 - will satisfy the hour of code so the
07:17 - back to the ER and so that that is a way
07:25 - for you to try out the opcode and see
07:27 - what the tutorials look like in terms of
07:29 - mechanics what we're expecting at this
07:31 - point is each of you who've signed up or
07:32 - thinking of signing up represent or work
07:36 - with this group of students either in a
07:37 - school setting or perhaps an app to
07:39 - school organization and we're going to
07:41 - be doing is you're going to be by
07:42 - signing up to do the hour of code you're
07:44 - saying you're going to bring those
07:45 - students at some point during CS
07:47 - Education Week december nine to fifteen
07:49 - you will set aside roughly an hour with
07:51 - your students to sit down and do one of
07:53 - the tutorials either the one I just
07:54 - showed you or one of the other tutorial
07:56 - options that's available and and if at
07:59 - this point if you're honest if you're
08:01 - attending this Web cast we're listening
08:03 - to this you already have all the tools
08:04 - you need in order to do the RF code even
08:06 - if your school and he has one computer
08:08 - or even know computers you can do the
08:10 - Arctic oh the ideal situation that would
08:12 - be if your students can each have a
08:15 - device of some sort in front of them
08:16 - that they can use the RF code either by
08:19 - themselves or paired up two or three
08:21 - students per device doesn't have to be
08:23 - PC for example of got here a tablet this
08:26 - is a heaven of an iPad what we also have
08:28 - other device is working and so for
08:31 - example here we have that same tutorial
08:33 - screen and if you actually hit go here
08:36 - you'll see it will launch the same
08:39 - puzzle we just looking at descriptively
08:43 - here you can see I'm actually doing the
08:45 - exact same program that I was just
08:48 - that's just running one program and you
08:52 - can see the anger break getting the
08:53 - pagan to the next level so that's that's
08:55 - the same in couture running on a tablet
08:58 - device it also went six part phones and
09:00 - and we're working on making sure we have
09:02 - compatibility with a whole bunch of
09:03 - different browser devices on PCs tablets
09:05 - Android surface and so forth so if you
09:10 - have access to devices you have what you
09:11 - need your goal is to sit down with your
09:13 - classroom go to the tutorials chosen
09:16 - every student will have a very very
09:18 - simple sana process they essentially uh
09:21 - actually when you sit down to the hour
09:24 - of code you go right into the tutorial
09:25 - and end the tutorial it a couple
09:27 - questions that are optional and then
09:29 - we'll be tracking how many students
09:30 - begin your hour of code using through
09:33 - those pages and that's how we'll know
09:34 - how many students ultimately participate
09:35 - in the hour of code and I think that's
09:39 - all I really want to talk about today so
09:41 - I guess I have a couple of does a couple
09:44 - of housekeeping option things we've got
09:46 - a lot of questions from teachers about
09:48 - that a lot of question from teachers
09:50 - about the prizes we're offering so for
09:51 - example we've announced that every
09:53 - teacher who does the hour of code will
09:55 - receive a free dropbox account you don't
09:58 - those dropbox account will be given out
10:00 - after the hour of code is over so to
10:03 - qualify you to be signed up if they've
10:06 - gone to the cs Edwin org site you have
10:10 - to registered to do the hour of code and
10:12 - after the arm comes over all the
10:13 - teachers who've registered who actually
10:15 - did the hour of code when we receive the
10:17 - instructions from us on how to get your
10:18 - dropbox account another thing is we
10:22 - often get asked by teachers is how do
10:24 - they start how do they start doing the
10:26 - our code with their with their students
10:28 - an answer is that the cs edward website
10:30 - will have a video on the homepage
10:33 - starting december ninth and that video
10:35 - is the best place to start the hour of
10:37 - code with your students so if you get
10:39 - into a classroom you sit down the
10:42 - students go to the page you can show
10:43 - them that video that will be on the
10:46 - homepage of side work that will be a
10:48 - short inspiring video explaining uh
10:51 - inspiring them to do the RF code and
10:53 - then each of them will then go in and
10:54 - begin the extra tutorial the tutorials
10:56 - of design
10:56 - self-teaching if you have some computer
10:59 - background yourself that's great but
11:01 - even if you have absolutely no prior
11:03 - experience with technical savvy it's
11:04 - okay once you get your students into the
11:06 - hour of code tutorials these tools will
11:08 - take over do themselves and if students
11:10 - get stuck and you're unable to answer
11:12 - the questions I'm sure some the other
11:13 - students people to help them out because
11:15 - they're meant to be so easy if you're in
11:18 - a school or class and slightly more
11:20 - technically advanced you're welcome to
11:21 - try some the more advanced tutorials and
11:23 - if your students finish the beginning
11:25 - tutorial very quickly they're welcome to
11:27 - go back and try some more advanced
11:28 - tutorials on their own if you have extra
11:30 - time left over so that uh so they've out
11:32 - sit around around waiting and with that
11:35 - let's go to the questions let's see what
11:39 - have here so the first question we have
11:42 - seven here first what we have is I would
11:44 - love to hand out stickers or swag to our
11:46 - students for participating I'm happy to
11:48 - buy from outside vendor but can we get
11:50 - our raw image to me plate absolutely so
11:52 - on the show you over here on the cs ed
11:56 - week meet me just a second r you guys
11:58 - jump over to screen share ok on the cs
12:07 - edited org website itself the very
12:10 - bottom we have a link to encode the
12:11 - resource kit and to go to the resource
12:14 - kit those are all the materials that
12:15 - might be helpful to you in putting other
12:17 - materials for the hour of code and so
12:19 - for example if you go to the logos
12:20 - section if you are some logos you can
12:22 - use if you go to for example banners we
12:25 - have some matters that you can use
12:27 - images here your local use and your
12:29 - materials we're doesn't have links here
12:30 - for example to poster so you can print
12:32 - out and adapt the back to the question
12:36 - which are answer the question in terms
12:40 - of stickers drag are we okay putting the
12:42 - coded org logo up with people to
12:43 - download yes okay so the one that if you
12:46 - go to logos page right here the one logo
12:48 - that's not on here if you want to give
12:50 - out the actual code org logo the co de
12:53 - in a box will make it available as well
12:55 - those those those make a great sticker
12:58 - for kids who are excited by computer
12:59 - science and want to to show that so
13:01 - we'll make that available steadily ball
13:02 - and but we do ask you not modify that
13:06 - logo or combine it with other material
13:09 - you have to use it logo by
13:10 - self as a standalone entity um that's
13:13 - one thing we ask yeah how do you feel
13:16 - with everything on a poster they create
13:17 - themselves the critical participative
13:20 - school songs it's not referring to yeah
13:23 - yeah so if you if you want to create
13:24 - your own directory if you want to create
13:27 - your own hour of code poster with your
13:31 - and you want to put the codes at our
13:32 - logo on there that's fine we just ask
13:35 - that you not use it for something it's
13:36 - not our of code or I see said we've
13:38 - related okay so next question we have on
13:41 - here is do I need to ask my students to
13:44 - register when they do the hour of code
13:45 - when students need to enter their email
13:47 - addresses no students do not engage
13:50 - their email addresses teachers can go to
13:54 - the when your students begin the hour of
13:56 - code there's no registration process
13:58 - needed up front students can go right
13:59 - into the tutorial at the end of the
14:02 - tutorial there is a optional set of
14:05 - questions the last questions like their
14:08 - gender age no guys gonna step in here AB
14:13 - so our tutorial doesn't require entering
14:18 - your email address nor do most of the
14:20 - sort of most popular ones and we've
14:22 - asked from anybody who's submitting
14:23 - tutorials to not require sign up there
14:25 - are some people who are requiring sign
14:27 - up on their tutorials and we're putting
14:29 - those at the bottom of the list because
14:30 - for two reasons for the children's
14:33 - privacy but also just to remove an extra
14:35 - step required before you start doing it
14:37 - at the end of the hour of code when you
14:39 - when you know finish and it gives you
14:42 - through the congrats message there's two
14:44 - optional things a student can do they
14:46 - can optionally enter their email address
14:47 - to get a certificate of completion and
14:50 - me an email and they can optionally say
14:52 - are they a boy or a girl or really to to
14:55 - donate their one hour to the boys team
14:57 - with the girls team because we want to
14:59 - basis create a small competition of to
15:02 - effectively show that girls can do this
15:03 - too and we highly suspect both hit 50 50
15:06 - participation by boys and girls and
15:09 - we're actually not saving that
15:11 - information on a per-user basis it's
15:12 - just a vote because it's not really a
15:14 - skating of the person's gender now we
15:18 - are also curating a whole bunch of
15:21 - follow-on tutorials for people who want
15:23 - to go
15:23 - beyond an hour which is basically if
15:25 - you're interested and you thought this
15:26 - was great and you want to learn more
15:27 - there's a whole bunch of option for
15:30 - learning more and those are longer than
15:32 - one hour tutorials every single one of
15:34 - those has some form of signup involved
15:37 - it was have nothing to do with the hour
15:39 - of code and those are basically for the
15:40 - student who wants to learn on their own
15:41 - they can do it on some of those required
15:43 - email address some of those 25 pounds
15:45 - emailed us some require your teachers
15:47 - email address and it depends on which
15:49 - one you choose and those are all
15:51 - basically not required as part of the
15:53 - hour of code ok ok ok ok ok you can take
15:58 - Eric aceticus that's next question we
16:00 - have is from Dora Spencer she's asking
16:04 - um right so she's asking she sees she
16:06 - sees where the students could get a
16:07 - certificate but the emails required to
16:09 - get the certificate I'm gonna live to
16:11 - school students died email I could use
16:13 - my email that would swamp me is there a
16:15 - certificate we can post you can download
16:16 - and use and I see no reason we can't
16:20 - post a generic certificate form when we
16:22 - can go to that you're also open create
16:24 - your own certificate form if you want to
16:25 - use that so purpose the certificate we
16:27 - email out will be a this be an image
16:30 - that has their name and some other
16:31 - information on there um ok yes Walter to
16:36 - note of that and post it in that
16:37 - resources Katie saw the reason we
16:39 - required during the way that is to
16:41 - personalize it with our names they
16:43 - receive it at home if they're doing it
16:44 - at school yeah yeah we also felt and the
16:47 - other thing that is it when we do mail
16:48 - it out to the students there is gonna be
16:49 - some information on there for parents in
16:51 - case parents want to learn more where
16:54 - the student did and get more involved in
16:57 - cells for example helping encourage
16:58 - their students been working for your
16:59 - science ok next question will we make
17:02 - the video on CS Edwin org available for
17:04 - download on a site other than youtube is
17:06 - blocked so many schools so we've
17:08 - actually made a lot of efforts not so
17:10 - although videos on our website we've
17:12 - made effort not to let through youtube I
17:14 - rather to link through education a
17:16 - special version of YouTube specifically
17:19 - for educational institutions which in
17:21 - theory is not blocked so we're making an
17:24 - effort to make sure that our videos are
17:25 - not blocked the promotional video as
17:28 - well as all the videos that we have on
17:30 - there now our level for download in fact
17:32 - there are if you go to the resources kit
17:33 - videos you can actually download those
17:35 - videos as files with you
17:37 - and then download your laptop and show
17:40 - so if you don't have a working internet
17:41 - connection you can download those videos
17:43 - ahead of time and show them your
17:45 - classroom hope that answers that
17:47 - question next question another question
17:51 - was can we use a coded org logo in our
17:54 - event posters arrested yes you can we'll
17:56 - make that a local available off of our
17:57 - website to download as long as the event
17:59 - posters are specifically for cle for our
18:02 - foot events the other question is there
18:04 - a special logo for the hour of code now
18:06 - we need a conscious decision not to
18:08 - create a logo for the hour of code
18:09 - itself because we don't you didn't want
18:12 - hour of code to be seen as a special
18:15 - branded uh entity the hour of code more
18:22 - concept to theme for this year's CS
18:24 - education week and so there is no hour
18:27 - of code logo we're purposely using the
18:28 - words hour of code every time we talk
18:29 - about it and that's why there's no no
18:32 - logo for that ok next question we are an
18:37 - NGO protein-coding in Hong Kong and
18:39 - we're very happy to learn the hour of
18:41 - code other cooperation opportunities
18:44 - with code org I'm so coded org we're
18:46 - essentially a clearinghouse or artwork
18:49 - submission of coded org is to ensure
18:51 - that every student has the opportunity
18:53 - to learn computer science so we promote
18:56 - organizations and we promote
18:58 - opportunities for students to learn
18:59 - computer science that said we can't
19:01 - partner with and get direct involved in
19:03 - all the various amazing activities that
19:06 - so many of you are responsible for
19:08 - around the world so the best we can do
19:10 - is we can link to and and and and
19:12 - provide references to education
19:15 - opportunities or those are online
19:16 - courses or tutorials hour of code and
19:19 - occasionally we will call out and
19:20 - highlight on are very social media
19:22 - channels notable articles or then so we
19:25 - think are relevant to computer science
19:26 - education but we're not really in a
19:28 - position to directly partner with a lot
19:31 - of these local events we really see this
19:33 - as an opportunity to view to be doing
19:35 - amazing things around the world in
19:36 - pursuit of computer science and when we
19:38 - see things that we think are optimized
19:40 - to promote will mention about our
19:41 - channels but if but for this particular
19:44 - example if you want to have a kid cody
19:46 - competition or if you want to run a code
19:48 - day campaign hong kong go for it do it
19:51 - and and and and we think it's fantastic
19:53 - and we don't think we need our help to
19:55 - pull that off ok let's see you next
19:58 - wishin my class period is only 40
20:00 - minutes can still do the RF code of
20:02 - course you can the RF code is more
20:03 - concept it's not literally a 60-minute
20:05 - only activity and in fact we believe
20:08 - many students can probably get through
20:09 - our tutorial behave in just half an hour
20:11 - and if the students don't finish it's
20:13 - okay they can still exit early and get
20:15 - credit for completing the hour of code
20:17 - or they can come back to try to finish
20:18 - it there on their own time okay
20:22 - someone's desk is now what's the link
20:24 - again for showing the angry bird so yes
20:27 - so the the link is CS adweek org slash
20:33 - learn to sew again that is discourtesy
20:37 - sorry org but once an hour we will do
20:42 - dude will do is live together so we'll
20:43 - go to the second word says what's an
20:46 - hour of code the first thing Thursday
20:48 - yeah so going to select org okay so
20:55 - here's the CSO Drita org web page and
20:57 - write down here in the very center once
21:00 - an hour of code right here where it says
21:03 - will provide a variety of tutorials if
21:06 - you click on that actually even easier
21:08 - ones devices check out tutorials in beta
21:10 - click on that link check out tutorials
21:12 - and data and that takes you right to the
21:14 - tutorials in beta and the very very
21:17 - first one here the one is right and
21:18 - center where since tutorials for
21:20 - beginners write your first program at
21:21 - code.org hit the Go button and this
21:24 - takes you to the angry bird to face two
21:27 - toilets now and you can use these
21:30 - buttons the top here to skip ahead for
21:32 - example if you're feeling ambitious i
21:33 - want to see a little 19 you can screw
21:35 - head to level 19 and that's just you get
21:38 - you show them better how did not just
21:41 - dismiss the videos which shorts to the
21:42 - notes for the videos yeah that's the one
21:45 - and one thing um den Devon yeah so one
21:51 - thing I accept endows of you through
21:53 - some reason you you don't have actors in
21:55 - your classroom you can actually click
21:57 - over and and go through these notes and
21:59 - actually get the same information in a
22:02 - non video format so if you're one of
22:03 - those teachers ask you
22:04 - our institutions of blocks videos for
22:07 - whatever reason you can always look at
22:09 - the notes here against a information one
22:12 - thing i should note is uh the videos
22:13 - will be conducted by some notable tech
22:16 - celebrities which is a lot of fun so
22:18 - those videos actually be more than just
22:20 - information they'll be kind of fun to
22:23 - watch to buy some folks you'll recognize
22:24 - and in fact in fact when you go to tools
22:28 - now you'll you'll see some days includes
22:30 - a couple Mark Zuckerberg teaching about
22:32 - loops Bill Gates teaching about the if
22:35 - statements and other so that's almost
22:37 - exactly a lot of fun okay next question
22:41 - what languages are the hour of code
22:43 - available in we are making a big effort
22:45 - to have the hour of code localized into
22:48 - as many languages as we can in fact
22:50 - right now there's a huge volunteer
22:52 - effort underway to localize the hour of
22:54 - code into like 100 plus different
22:56 - languages in fact if i want to show you
22:57 - I can reup these languages we already
22:59 - have German Indonesian Portuguese
23:02 - Portuguese Brazilian Romanian done we
23:06 - will have by the time it launches
23:09 - russian italian norwegian French Greek
23:14 - Dutch at least and Chinese if James is
23:19 - fencing tronic tofu for us and a few
23:21 - students if any on this phone call to
23:23 - help us localize where can they go just
23:25 - the children of the the process where
23:28 - they go to the bottom that footage of
23:30 - the footer okay so deposited with it
23:32 - right okay so so at the very bottom yes
23:37 - it's very bottom of the tutorial page
23:39 - you can see help us translate to your
23:40 - language click that button and you can
23:42 - sign up here uh and it will actually
23:45 - listen information on how to translate
23:48 - actually here right it can also go to
23:50 - code.org / translate just just really
23:52 - reference / their work / translate and
23:57 - this is another is all the materials on
24:00 - how two triangles you can go here find
24:01 - information we'd love to have your help
24:03 - translating the RF code go back okay
24:08 - next question we have I can't do the
24:13 - hour of code during see said week
24:14 - because I final exams and so what I do
24:16 - before and after abs
24:17 - we would love you to the our code during
24:20 - seaside week because you can't that's
24:22 - fine too doing the hour of code after or
24:26 - even Freddie the week before although
24:27 - the week before we're not quite sure
24:29 - exactly when all the absolute final
24:30 - materials will be posted but certainly
24:32 - you can do the article after she said we
24:33 - gots fine a fact we're thinking of the
24:35 - hour of code Beyonce said we may be be
24:37 - this perpetually ongoing process for
24:40 - anyone anytime can go in and do the RF
24:41 - code long after at the seaside week is
24:43 - over okay next question we've had some
24:47 - trouble getting learn code org to run
24:50 - properly on IE internet explorer did i
24:52 - hear you say you're working on a program
24:53 - running different browsers chrome works
24:55 - great but we don't have chrome on a
24:57 - student laptops we're making a huge
24:58 - effort to ensure compatibility across as
25:00 - mini laptop and is made browsers as
25:02 - possible I'm happy so the IE now works
25:04 - on I 98 ni 11 has yesterdays of yes as
25:07 - of yesterday we got over to 99 and I ate
25:11 - was so working i ate and it's a it's you
25:15 - know the older the browser we get the
25:17 - less supportive hat for some of the
25:19 - techniques we're using now first four
25:22 - hour of code we're trying to ensure to
25:24 - run is in mini spa scrub but one thing i
25:26 - should stand this is we are going to do
25:28 - browser to text if it's fine coming
25:30 - we're going to do browser detection for
25:33 - people's computers and if they're
25:34 - running on internet explorer will show
25:36 - the tutorials that work on in attics for
25:38 - for your browser service if students
25:40 - aren't stuck trying something it doesn't
25:42 - work on that particular browser the
25:44 - scratch tutorials in particular which
25:45 - it's a great one will work on pretty
25:47 - much any browser that has flash
25:49 - installed which all the older browsers
25:50 - thing when you see here see two thousand
25:53 -  houston fishing um let's take a
25:55 - look a so so almost everyone is a
25:57 - beginner doing suggestion for which
25:59 - tutorials fit each grade or ages yes the
26:02 - tutorials will have a rough age
26:04 - breakdown to go to the tutorial page you
26:06 - will see some suggestions for different
26:08 - age ranges that said the code org to
26:11 - tour we've created we worked hard to
26:13 - make sure that really works from
26:14 - literally ages eight to an 88 so even if
26:16 - you have third graders second graders
26:19 - we've tested it on 44 year old and she
26:22 - was able to through quite a few levels
26:23 - herself so whether you're you know
26:25 - element in early let me to school all
26:27 - the way up to high school we've had high
26:28 - school students doing the beat that
26:29 - tutorial and fun of it and we
26:31 - you've even had you know uh folks in a
26:33 - welder 20s 30s 40s doing it as well
26:36 - current learn pitch suggests ages but
26:40 - those aren't exactly accurate yet pretty
26:43 - the way the delineation is going to be
26:45 - really beginners or intermediate that's
26:47 - actually more important than age because
26:50 - this advance its 10 year olds who
26:52 - already know scratch will find the
26:55 - beginner stuff boring frighten these
26:56 - high school students who've never done
26:57 - it before who will need to start at the
26:59 - elementary level that many classrooms
27:01 - will have a couple students who happen
27:02 - to party Venus was a program rather than
27:04 - them make a big deal about how easy this
27:06 - is and potentially demotivate some of
27:08 - their peers it's probably better for
27:10 - those two suits tribal more advanced
27:12 - tutorials while the true beginners in
27:13 - classroom do the e for our foot
27:18 - experience okay next how can i get a
27:22 - speaker from co.org to come to my school
27:24 - so unfortunately we would love we would
27:26 - love to send the speaker if we put it
27:28 - over to every school in this country
27:29 - sadly that's not something we can we can
27:31 - do what we can do however is encourage
27:35 - you to seek out tech technical mentors
27:38 - in your community you know across the
27:40 - country now for every community has some
27:43 - sort of local business that is involved
27:45 - in programming or science related
27:48 - activities and in our experienced
27:50 - engineers and and other professionals
27:53 - from those organizations are only too
27:55 - happy to come to schools and talk about
27:56 - the ports of computer science education
27:57 - we are hoping to pull the seuda that the
28:00 - last minute we have a database about
28:01 - twenty five five thousand engineers who
28:04 - want to help with computer science
28:05 - education and we're hoping in the next
28:08 - four weeks to basically line them up by
28:10 - location to give you a list of possible
28:13 - engineers near you could come to your
28:14 - school to help with the power code or to
28:16 - pick it off for it or if you're talking
28:18 - about what they do it their workplace
28:19 - icons like that what i will say is we
28:21 - are having as you may have seen from our
28:22 - website we are having a series of tech
28:24 - luminaries you know i'm kicking off the
28:28 - hour of code virtually using same
28:30 - technology we're using right now with
28:31 - number of different schools so for
28:33 - example we're going to have presumable
28:35 - gates has agreed to do a chat with up to
28:39 - 10 different classrooms alive and those
28:40 - 10 classrooms we will be picking those
28:42 - randomly those class
28:44 - hands to be interacting directly with
28:46 - bill however those chats will also be
28:50 - broadcast live via YouTube and other
28:52 - means after the fact so so any of you
28:57 - who want to have your classroom watch
29:01 - someone like for example said ok I off
29:05 - the our code you'll have that chance to
29:07 - show that they need to your classroom
29:09 - and that can be quite inspiring so you
29:10 - can't get a live speaker you can offer
29:12 - you a pre inspiring speaker virtually ok
29:16 - next question what is intended outcome
29:19 - for students after the hour of code uh
29:21 - you want to start with the end in mind
29:23 - of the students at cast a vision is
29:24 - consistent great question obviously the
29:27 - hour of code was just a one hour long
29:29 - thing and that was it it would be
29:31 - nothing more than a marketing stunt and
29:33 - and that's not that's not our intent so
29:36 - so part of what we're tending as a Java
29:38 - code is a way to demystify country
29:40 - science to spark that interesting and
29:42 - help students realize if your designs is
29:44 - not as intimidating as perhaps they
29:46 - thought it was and hopefully encourage
29:48 - them to go on and pursue a much longer
29:50 - and deeper interest in computer science
29:52 - so we ourselves have have created a 20
29:55 - hour long online tutorial with the hour
29:57 - of code that that one hour long tutorial
29:59 - there were promoting is part of our code
30:00 - turns out that section just the first
30:02 - hour of a 20 hour long series of
30:05 - tutorials and we're encouraging teachers
30:06 - and students to to to those other on
30:08 - their own free time or actual
30:10 - encouraging students are the teachers to
30:12 - incorporate that 20 hour long creek elem
30:14 - into their own classrooms as part of say
30:16 - in math or science a track with in there
30:20 - within the classroom ok one thing that
30:22 - says kids in K through 12 grades almost
30:25 - none of them are actively thinking about
30:27 - jobs or developing a tech based business
30:30 - you know their parents are certainly
30:32 - thinking about that but you're yes the
30:34 - average eighth grader that's nowhere
30:35 - near on the horizon and there's really
30:38 - two messages that resonate well with
30:40 - kids in terms of why study this stuff
30:43 - one reason is that simply no matter what
30:45 - you want to do if you want to become a
30:46 - doctor or politician or accountant or a
30:48 - nurse this is something that's relevant
30:50 - to learn for the 21st century and the
30:53 - second message is building a cool
30:55 - smartphone app that you can share with
30:57 - you
30:58 - which way more kids are interested in
31:00 - that they're getting a job basically one
31:03 - great big changes so yep okay hold
31:07 - answer the question next question here
31:10 - what about caper based games if there's
31:11 - no computerized absolutely so when I
31:13 - mentioned that series of unplugged
31:15 - tutorials these are all paper based
31:17 - activities that you can do with little
31:19 - paper and pencil and no jaraxxus is a
31:22 - little bit of private operation involved
31:24 - as a teacher you need to conduct some
31:26 - materials ahead of time and otherwise
31:27 - prepare for it but you certainly don't
31:30 - need a computer to do those activities
31:31 - in fact you can do the outside or you
31:33 - list on the website yeah I guess you can
31:35 - go there now and try them out now and
31:37 - start preparing for those right now the
31:40 - next question someone's calling out that
31:42 - scratch requires flash what what devices
31:44 - like ipad or flash lyst computers i
31:46 - actually don't think scratch will run on
31:48 - the ipad awesome instead scratch
31:50 - requires flash which has strengths and
31:53 - weaknesses the benefit of that is that
31:55 - it will work on the older computers that
31:57 - don't support html5 but all have flash
32:00 - so if you're on internet explorer 8 or
32:02 - on a node Mac pre OS 10 or even three OS
32:06 - 10.4 you won't be able to run the newer
32:09 - tutorials such as the photo tutorial or
32:11 - you will be able to run scratch whereas
32:14 - on the iPad you can either download an
32:16 - app which somebody else asked a question
32:18 - for or you can run the code org tutorial
32:21 - or the snap tutorial there's basically
32:23 - three providers code.org snap and tinker
32:26 - that are in the drag-and-drop category
32:28 - that will work on an iPad without a
32:29 - download and it's a whole bunch of these
32:31 - but if you download will work my iPad
32:33 - but if you're an older browser you
32:34 - should be scratch and to help make this
32:38 - easy for you since you know I know this
32:41 - all in my head that it's not as obvious
32:42 - if you visit the tutorial page with the
32:45 - computer you want to use it should sort
32:47 - the most relevant category to the top so
32:50 - if you're on an Internet Explorer
32:51 - browser it will show you these are
32:52 - tutorials that work within explore if
32:54 - you're on a mobile browser it should
32:56 - show your tutorials that work on your
32:58 - device and if you're on a regular sort
33:00 - of chrome or firefox modern browser on
33:03 - the desktop it'll show things that work
33:05 - there as the top kara soul okay
33:09 - okay thank you uh getting in the
33:12 - questions here locally i am speaking on
33:16 - the importance of teaching PP of science
33:18 - that children can hour of code help
33:19 - schools with an already prepared talk or
33:21 - slides so parents who aren't tech savvy
33:24 - to educate parents infinity yes he has
33:26 - actually available in this is that
33:27 - report sex yes you did resources right
33:29 - yeses yeah i should i'll share right now
33:32 - so so it's a great question and in fact
33:34 - this is not just for parents trying to
33:36 - educate their schools for teachers who
33:38 - won for example when one day we're
33:39 - encouraging you to do is host an
33:41 - assembly in your school where you can
33:44 - use and selling school to kick off our
33:47 - of code and encourage your students so
33:49 - if you go to resource kit go to
33:52 - presentations there are some
33:54 - presentations in here that you can
33:56 - download for example here we see if we
33:58 - pitch deck you can download and you can
34:02 - actually right now um and me may try to
34:07 - put some other ones up there as well
34:08 - this is this is really long that's
34:10 - harder to find on your own yeah well we
34:13 - should add to her okay there's a much
34:14 - better presentation we'll add it up
34:16 - there basically if you go to see i said
34:17 - we'd org under resource kit in the
34:19 - footer and presentations after get off
34:23 - this call will put another better
34:24 - presentation yeah we do it was to school
34:26 - stone yeah yeah so it's designed for
34:28 - trying to teachers or educators it's
34:31 - it's it's stopped yeah yeah doctors
34:34 - teachers yeah bet if we put on that CS
34:36 - teachers and it says these powerpoints
34:40 - yeah yeah just put that's hidden over
34:44 - there but we'll put it into the other
34:45 - resource good as well yeah ok ok and go
34:49 - back to our visitation ah ok to us next
35:00 - year what programming software will
35:03 - elementary schools use do you have an
35:05 - activity to recommend so we obviously we
35:08 - can recommend the tutorial that we've
35:11 - built a coded or tutorial as designed
35:13 - fella middle schools scratchers three
35:15 - the read recommends at scratch the code
35:18 - ahora one and tinker that all three of
35:20 - those are designed for elementary school
35:22 - students stinkers
35:23 - the schools well their hour of code
35:26 - initiative yes free for schools I'm not
35:29 - sure if the longer the longer thing I
35:31 - think it may have a free version our big
35:33 - version for beyond one hour certainly
35:35 - scratch is very popular Alice's popular
35:39 - kodu is popular and the new code or
35:41 - tutorials I believe it could be very
35:43 - popular yeah and we're going to have in
35:45 - addition to be one our list of tutorials
35:47 - will have a separate list which is for
35:49 - beyond one hour format in the same way
35:51 - it's not quite up yet all of the tabs
35:53 - from the absolute concedes it's not if
35:56 - you click the beyond one hour tab you
35:58 - don't see anything yet but those will be
36:00 - live certainly by the time our code to
36:03 - help you find them I guess so just to
36:05 - show any so much because excuse every
36:07 - org learn to beyond is not live yet but
36:11 - beyond one hour by time we go live with
36:14 - suicide week beyond an hour we'll have
36:16 - tutorials you can do to take you beyond
36:18 - the hour of code and to continue your CS
36:20 - education those will similarly have
36:23 - sections for beginners which pervasive
36:26 - design for elementary schools yeah and
36:28 - so another question here we started
36:31 - translating the tutorials well these
36:33 - wonderful tutorial apps to campaign ends
36:35 - absolutely so all the tutorials from
36:37 - hour of code will be continued to be
36:39 - available after CSF because over and in
36:41 - fact we're going to like I said we're
36:42 - we're thinking that after see I said
36:43 - with itself will just encourage that our
36:46 - code to live on and students can come
36:47 - try anytime they want on as far as
36:51 - editing improvement two translations
36:52 - later than that most of your life yeah
36:54 - okay that'll be continually evolving
36:56 - thing as well yeah okay disco dork focus
37:00 - on us only or is it a worldwide
37:02 - commitment to the clothes cause of
37:04 - coding knowledge at this one go for em
37:06 - we have two views on this everything
37:09 - that we developed it as marketing
37:11 - material or curriculum material we think
37:14 - of something that is of an international
37:16 - value and we want to be as much as we
37:18 - can to transit our tutorials translate
37:20 - our videos transito websites to other
37:23 - languages to enable everybody worldwide
37:25 - to benefit from oh the things that we're
37:27 - doing there are us only are the
37:29 - political advocacy work on after change
37:32 - laws in the states or the
37:35 - effort of professional development to
37:38 - effectively bring teachers up to speak
37:40 - to teach classes at those two are very
37:43 - local efforts they're both local and
37:46 - nature and expensive at to do worldwide
37:49 - so for those things we will do them in
37:51 - the US only but make the materials for
37:53 - them available for other organizations
37:55 - to be able to use worldwide so marketing
37:58 - curriculum worldwide advocacy and
38:01 - teacher professional development at us
38:04 - only and we already know that from the
38:07 - work we've already done even from the
38:08 - initial video and certainly the hour of
38:09 - code we know we're having worldwide
38:11 - impact even if it's not quite as deep as
38:14 - the impact would expect out in the
38:15 - United States thank you okay next
38:19 - question is doing to download an app the
38:21 - iPad you know if let me show this an
38:22 - ipad right here and you can go to the
38:26 - browser it's going safari the browser
38:29 - and the browser goes right to between
38:34 - the browser here going through the
38:35 - tutorials and you can see the satori
38:38 - here and this is actually running in the
38:40 - browser so no special app is needed that
38:42 - said if for some reason you don't have
38:45 - internet access because this does
38:47 - require internet access you don't have
38:48 - internet access but you want to even
38:50 - iPad there are applications you can
38:52 - download for the ipad such as tinker
38:54 - take your time as an ethical double or
38:57 - white spot and those are also listed the
39:00 - holistic controls yeah and again we will
39:03 - highlight those for you can go in ahead
39:04 - of time when you do have internet access
39:06 - download yacked your iPad or other
39:08 - tablet device and then offline use those
39:10 - tutorials but do but no specialist off
39:13 - is not needed next question you're very
39:15 - slow internet can we download tutorials
39:17 - in advance it going to depend the
39:19 - tutorial we've built the answer is no
39:21 - any available via the browser /
39:23 - continues effective internet connection
39:25 - but there are some software and app
39:27 - version whose can be downloaded in
39:29 - advance and I'll again you're all you
39:31 - can always use the paper and pencil
39:32 - exercises which required element access
39:34 - if there's a section in the tutorials
39:36 - list that is called apps that teach
39:39 - coding and those are things that you can
39:40 - download an advanced some of them are
39:42 - apps for the ipads and there are apps
39:43 - for android some of them are for pcs and
39:46 - desktops
39:49 - okay let's see we have here what program
39:55 - do we recommend two views or students
39:57 - would like to have them loaded ahead of
39:58 - time that is a scratch in game press
40:01 - they're going to be listed in the order
40:03 - that we recommend although we're
40:05 - basically reaching out to teachers to
40:07 - help us improve the recommendations to
40:09 - make sure we're sorting the different
40:10 - submission through the suit in proper
40:12 - order yeah but something recommended
40:15 - some of the recommended tutorials will
40:17 - be discreet a bill through web browser
40:18 - and don't require our pre-loading other
40:20 - is presently mythic scratch scratch I
40:22 - give them the modern version scratch
40:23 - scratch used to be a PC program you
40:25 - download scratch now i believe is dis
40:27 - equip site so and so the latest version
40:30 - scratch is simply hosted in a web
40:31 - browser assuming you have the web for
40:34 - beginners i'd recommend the code or
40:35 - tutorial or scratch and for people who
40:38 - already know some programming i'd
40:39 - recommend code Academy or contact me
40:43 - okay once again I wonder what is the
40:46 - tutorial website again it is CS ed week
40:50 - or CS org right now if you look under
40:54 - work work what's the hour of code it's
40:56 - at the bottom of the link yeah when that
40:57 - one code begins they'll be a big big red
40:59 - button saying start now yeah yeah that's
41:01 - a good point so totally cleared you go
41:03 - to CS Edwin org right now there's a
41:06 - special version of website designed for
41:08 - this kind of early ramp-up period during
41:12 - which time we're right we're
41:13 - pre-registering people once we get to
41:15 - December ninth we will and NCS ed begins
41:18 - we will be switching over to a different
41:21 - version of the website that will look
41:23 - similar but it will you know the giant
41:26 - big button of the homepage will be start
41:28 - the hour of code so it will make it much
41:30 - much easier to start the hour of code
41:31 - and do the tutorials once we get to
41:33 - December night that we switch over to
41:35 - the call to live CSF website versus the
41:38 - one we have now which is about carrying
41:39 - and pre-registering on so forth ok
41:44 - crushing is doing one do we want do we
41:47 - want you to use the tutorials from CS
41:49 - edu org or code Academy good calm you've
41:53 - been using code of canada calm so we
41:56 - don't care what tutorials you use we're
41:58 - looking for is for students to get
42:00 - expose the computer science it's
42:01 - already using code Academy and you
42:03 - haven't fed Academy that's fantastic
42:04 - that's great you're already way ahead of
42:06 - the game because it means you're already
42:07 - teaching your students computer science
42:09 - and that's wonderful the hour of code is
42:10 - really aimed at alternative um but we
42:13 - really aimed at those students and
42:14 - schools that don't currently have any
42:16 - computer science education and are and
42:19 - and therefore we're using this as an
42:20 - opportunity to kick-start and expose
42:22 - students for the first time to computer
42:24 - science and so the tutorials we're
42:26 - promoting are really leveraged at that
42:28 - very very first time experience and also
42:30 - for younger students if you've got
42:31 - students who are already been talked but
42:33 - academy that's fantastic I'm certainly
42:36 - not going to say you know don't do
42:38 - something to stop stop doing some oil
42:40 - anything else that's great can we do our
42:43 - own flash actionscript tutorials if you
42:46 - have the software again if you are
42:48 - comfortable yeah absolutely yes you're
42:49 - comfortable teaching your students how
42:51 - to developed I did kind of learn
42:53 - programming by using flash fabulous
42:55 - that's fantastic ah are all these
42:59 - tutorials going to be up after the week
43:02 - yes they will the tutorials available
43:04 - beyonce's education we get in the end
43:07 - here ah thank you notes thank you notes
43:11 - here's a question well any of the hour
43:13 - of code tutorials contain information on
43:15 - how to write actual code not just drag
43:17 - and drop the answer is yes for example
43:20 - code Academy has a series of tutorials
43:22 - on learning how to write JavaScript and
43:25 - business mothers then those those
43:26 - multiple carousels that first engineer
43:30 - ones at the next one right out there is
43:33 - going to be how to learn javascript yeah
43:34 - I'll show that again like I don't fit
43:36 - before but just to verify it so here are
43:40 - Zika carousel tutorials third one down
43:43 - two toes and shelter each one these
43:44 - tutorials right here is designed to
43:46 - teach actual coding so there's code
43:48 - combat there is you know code HS Khan
43:51 - Academy code Avengers code Academy and
43:54 - so forth pinochle okay that's question
44:00 - uh can we have students complete our own
44:04 - tutorials or do you have to use our
44:06 - resources of course any any computer
44:09 - science instruction counts for hour of
44:10 - code however the one thing I will say is
44:12 - if you're having students do your own
44:14 - tutorial
44:15 - and you're not starting the tutorial
44:17 - from our own website their participation
44:20 - won't count toward our overall numbers
44:22 - if students kind of globally doing the
44:25 - hour of code so we will have I don't
44:27 - know exactly how yet you will have a
44:29 - mechanism so the suit for teachers who
44:31 - are doing other offline tutorial susan
44:32 - paper pencil or the teachers who are
44:35 - doing their educators who are doing
44:36 - their own tutorials will have a
44:38 - mechanism for you to put a report your
44:40 - participation after the fact and that
44:43 - way we can both get those numbers into
44:45 - our system so they count toward the
44:46 - overall number of students worldwide who
44:49 - did the hour of code as well as will
44:52 - know that you did the hour of code so
44:53 - you're eligible for the dropbox account
44:55 - into the other prizes which you wouldn't
44:56 - otherwise be eligible for if it didn't
44:58 - know you did the hour of code so there
45:00 - will be mechanism to report your put
45:01 - your participation after the fact will
45:06 - the answer to these questions be in a
45:08 - written format after the check no we
45:10 - don't have any plans of doing a
45:13 - transcript although if any of you
45:15 - volunteers want to do that and you send
45:17 - it to it we'll post it yeah yeah but it
45:19 - does a good point so this this live
45:21 - webcast will be posted on YouTube is a
45:23 - video you can watch out for the fact
45:25 - anyone wants to go to the YouTube watch
45:27 - the video transcribe it and and send us
45:30 - that transcript will post it it's yeah
45:34 - youtube.com slash code or no period
45:38 - right okay that's our channel on YouTube
45:40 - okay uh can I repeat the programs for
45:44 - elementary school it'll be on the
45:47 - tutorial fit the tutorials page make it
45:49 - very clear which ones are great for
45:51 - elementary schools I was previewing the
45:55 - sites and they require a login or
45:57 - account to use a don't see tutorial page
45:59 - and a way to have a distorted view
46:01 - material without having to enroll it was
46:04 - different than we part of the event so
46:07 - that's your act so some of some of the
46:09 - tutorials do require a log on or account
46:13 - to use those soils will be pushed down
46:16 - to the bottom of the page come c s
46:20 - education week i'm not sure inaudible
46:21 - class today most the tutorials do not
46:23 - require any sort of log on in order to
46:26 - try using them
46:27 - and so you should be able to go to the
46:29 - tutorials page right now and try the
46:31 - tutorials as a teacher to preview them
46:33 - without having to do any sort of login
46:35 - and if you're having problems that you
46:37 - can post on our forums or email us help
46:40 - at code.org get further questions ok so
46:45 - this is even great by the way stuff I
46:47 - think it's all of you for so many great
46:48 - questions um here's a great question
46:51 - very important question I registered my
46:53 - whole school do my teachers need to
46:55 - register also in order to get their
46:57 - Dropbox prize absolutely if you have
47:00 - registered your whole school individual
47:02 - teachers still need to sign up on their
47:03 - own with their own personal email
47:05 - addresses in order to be eligible for
47:07 - dropbox anything that's a great question
47:09 - and again and again after the hour of
47:12 - code after suicide because over that's
47:14 - when teachers will be getting their drop
47:15 - out together we've heard a few teachers
47:17 - who are frustrated they designed of and
47:19 - have not yet gotten the dropbox account
47:20 - and that will happen after the output is
47:22 - over see there's a question about what
47:28 - we're going to do for kindergarten ok so
47:30 - what are we going to tell them from
47:32 - kindergarten there's a number of tablet
47:34 - apps or iPhone apps the one I recommend
47:36 - the highest is called light box which
47:38 - from age four and up they can do it if
47:41 - you don't have a smartphone the code or
47:44 - tutorials can be played by by
47:46 - kindergarteners they won't be very far
47:47 - any but it's still you know think if
47:50 - they can use a mouse or tablet like
47:53 - butter the code or two times we delta
47:55 - epsilonv my four-year-old daughter is
47:57 - going on so I okay we're gonna offer an
48:00 - open badges event we bought before we
48:05 - currently have no plans to offer an open
48:07 - badge although it has been brought up
48:08 - before maybe for the 20-hour tutorial it
48:11 - would be suitable for that but i will so
48:15 - to hear a girl scout troop and you want
48:17 - to do the hour of code in your Girl
48:19 - Scout troop by all means you can create
48:21 - your own fun patch for the hour of code
48:23 - and make that available to your tier
48:25 - true let's see any questions here uh
48:32 - right the question is if I do the angry
48:34 - birds tutorial with 20 or 30 students or
48:36 - every student and his or her own pace or
48:39 - they better done in groups of two three
48:41 - or four
48:41 - our research actually shows that pair
48:44 - programming or programming with more
48:45 - than like the two or three students at a
48:47 - time in a small group takes a little bit
48:49 - longer it's a little slower but it's
48:51 - ultimately more effective and knowledge
48:53 - retention so if you actually would
48:56 - encourage there for students vrf code in
48:59 - pairs to students per computer if you if
49:01 - you can and that way and then and then
49:03 - that pair students can work there
49:04 - together and help each other to go
49:06 - through that's actually really fun way
49:07 - to do it it's also more social which is
49:09 - important for people with end of
49:10 - programming is just for good point
49:12 - although I yourself because I guess we
49:13 - should say our official different you
49:14 - heard it here first our official
49:16 - recommendation is that you do the
49:18 - tutorials in pairs of two and that
49:20 - because it's more social increased
49:22 - knowledge retention they're easier that
49:25 - are able to help each other get past
49:26 - obstacles they hit them and so forth you
49:31 - can also do it by the way if you're a
49:32 - younger classroom likes a kindergarten
49:34 - another way to do this is with the
49:35 - entire class together in front of a
49:37 - large projector or smart board where the
49:40 - teacher can be more easily facilitate
49:42 - and students shout out answers and have
49:44 - it be a very social activity also some
49:47 - of the unplugged activities the paper
49:48 - prints activities are also suitable for
49:50 - younger children a little bit more of
49:52 - scaffolding for the teacher what does
49:57 - the plan need to look like is it okay
49:58 - for it to just be a list of teachers and
50:00 - times or do you need a detailed account
50:02 - of activities this is a quota so teacher
50:04 - know you explain the background here so
50:06 - we have offered special prizes for
50:09 - schools that are offering the hour of
50:11 - code the entire school in fact is this
50:13 - repeated here we're making available a
50:15 - complete computer lab pursecase on every
50:19 - state inscription 50 states and every
50:21 - state we're going to pick one school
50:22 - that will receive a complete lab of
50:25 - three computers which is which is
50:26 - fantastic in order to qualify that
50:28 - though you have to do the hour of code
50:29 - for your whole school and you have to
50:31 - submit a plan showing how you're going
50:35 - to be the article for your your whole
50:36 - school that plan does not have to do to
50:39 - tenten's question elicit teachers and x
50:42 - is sufficient to qualify for logical
50:45 - plan for clinical this up ok I mean
50:50 - we're going to screen share here and
50:51 - show you where to find a sample plan to
50:54 - see
50:54 - said we've got org 10 / should just go
50:59 - to see a seventh ugh you said join us
51:01 - and then look down it tells you the base
51:05 - prizes and you want to see the details
51:08 - about the prizes it tells you need a
51:10 - logistics plan here's a sample plan so
51:13 - this is what a sample plan looks like
51:14 - which is for each sort of section of the
51:17 - day which key feature is offering this
51:19 - out of code to which students and how
51:21 - many students so times and teacher named
51:24 - the number of students is all we need
51:25 - you don't need to specify in advance
51:27 - activities because we know that you're
51:29 - trying to sort them out yourself great
51:32 - so that that's example of what a plan
51:35 - look like in order to qualify for the
51:37 - think of all that i should say you know
51:40 - this point is a number of schools of
51:42 - have submitted as you're completely that
51:44 - they are doing ed full school but some
51:47 - states you have better odds and others
51:48 - so i would encourage you let me quickly
51:50 - share with that be furious Dakota North
51:52 - Dakota especially you're in great shape
51:54 - I'll show you if you go to go back to
51:57 - the cs Edwin org page my favorite page
52:00 - in the entire site is is right here we
52:03 - have a running tally of who signed up so
52:07 - far as you can see right now we're up to
52:09 - 1.9 million students by eleven thousand
52:12 - six i'm going to organizers but you can
52:14 - actually see under whole schools here
52:16 - these are all of the schools who have
52:20 - said that their entire schools
52:21 - participating and so for example you
52:24 - know last week there was something well
52:26 - but for some schools in Arizona Arkansas
52:28 - uh California tough odds in California
52:32 - um Colorado Delaware only four schools
52:36 - in Delaware ah Florida's doing quite
52:39 - well Guam it was eligible but you could
52:43 - do this oh so you can you can go through
52:44 - here and really intestate one school and
52:46 - each state is gonna win a class that a
52:48 - lot laptops exactly so if you're in a
52:51 - small stood submit a plan right exactly
52:54 - okay um see is it okay if I make an
52:58 - Edmodo badge for students doing hour of
53:00 - code using the hour of code logo yep
53:02 - great that'd be fantastic if you do to
53:04 - that send email to
53:07 - help it put the rug and let us know
53:09 - about it oh just just post it on our
53:11 - Facebook page surfer if you use these
53:13 - computer science education week logo
53:15 - yeah rather than the code daughter logo
53:17 - because the hour of code really is about
53:19 - computer science education week but the
53:21 - Lord is organizing it this year and then
53:23 - pulling all the pieces together but 11
53:26 - that's a very little is really about
53:28 - this this internationally celebrated you
53:30 - know in the United States
53:31 - congressionally recognized week called
53:33 - computer science education week yeah and
53:36 - that logo is actually more important to
53:38 - use but let's done this for that point
53:40 - cuz this is a really important I think a
53:41 - lot of people like the cook we're a very
53:43 - visible organizational now because we're
53:45 - helping organize a lot of the things but
53:47 - we really don't want this to become
53:49 - about code or we're just an organization
53:51 - trying to be computer science to every
53:53 - student in this country and around the
53:55 - world and it's not about us as novel
53:57 - co.org it's about amazing work you do
53:59 - animation with educators in this country
54:01 - and around the world are doing and
54:02 - ultimately about the students who choose
54:03 - to study computer science and so if
54:05 - you're going to you're going to promote
54:06 - anything promote CS education week which
54:08 - is a about you know pure science um if
54:12 - you want promote code this code is cool
54:13 - that's great but but we really don't
54:15 - want code it's not about us at code.org
54:16 - there's so many amazing organizations
54:18 - and educators and companies and
54:20 - tutorials in the world it's really not
54:22 - about us so with that said by all means
54:26 - going to create a badge to do so that's
54:27 - its great idea okay um is a good
54:31 - question if you're an experienced IT
54:32 - person how do you get plugged in to help
54:34 - it's a few things you can do one thing
54:36 - you can do if you haven't done already
54:37 - is good with our website co.org and
54:40 - there's a is a place where you can sign
54:43 - up on there as a silent addition as an
54:45 - engineer and then walk through is that
54:47 - fine so really cookies here we want to
54:49 - do so go to ok code.org and this is this
54:54 - is this is us in our capacities five
54:56 - clearinghouse you can go to this right
54:59 - here sign this petition and then once
55:02 - you've done that or enter that you're an
55:03 - engineer oh yeah once once you sign up
55:08 - as a soft engineer that puts you kind of
55:10 - an hour an hour list of potential
55:12 - volunteers we're not doing much with

55:16 - that more available to educators in
55:18 - schools but more friendly um do
55:20 - wait for us I have two local if you're
55:23 - an experienced IT person you know get
55:25 - into your community and make sure that
55:27 - your local schools of your code they're
55:29 - having trouble trouble often a volunteer
55:32 - and going to help them you have a kid
55:34 - get in your kids classroom and work with
55:35 - their teacher to make sure they're
55:36 - teaching science in a school get
55:38 - involved in your school board to try

55:42 - understands importance to the science in
55:44 - your community those are all important
55:47 - yeah we're five minutes left so let
55:50 - start to wrap things down is to see some
55:52 - of the other top questions here let's
55:56 - see me crunch I'm looking for a doubt
56:00 - looking for questions have not yet been
56:01 - answered some questions here are
56:03 - repeated and you've already answered
56:07 - there's a question says I've registered
56:09 - my school and I'm submitting was just
56:11 - it's fine do I need to do anything else
56:13 - the answer's no you don't need to do
56:15 - anything else will contact you asked
56:17 - after the fact we will pick the winners
56:18 - in each States and will email the 111
56:22 - registered educator and everyone won the
56:24 - person who registered their whole school
56:26 - as an email will contact that email to
56:29 - say you want relations and then we'll

56:39 - they'll be some come back and forth um
56:42 - what's on here
56:53 - the 100
57:05 - it did when are you going to exit push
57:07 - yourself the question says I'm in an
57:08 - online high school and the students have
57:09 - different hardware software we have a
57:11 - suggestion that is geared for high
57:11 - school students and can be done online
57:13 - as long as the computers are relatively
57:17 - modern meaning ie9 in an explorer 9 or
57:20 - above or Chrome or Firefox the browser's
57:22 - then either codecademy ver Khan Academy
57:25 - would work and if these students have
57:26 - zero experience than the code letter
57:28 - tutorials would work now the four
57:30 - primary suggestions I said are generally
57:32 - good go to one's the code Orioles
57:34 - scratch Khan Academy and build Academy
57:38 - and the read the way to choose between
57:40 - them is partly if you have an older
57:42 - browser go with scratch they have a new
57:44 - browser go with the other ones and then
57:46 - decide if they're experienced
57:47 - programmers go with the JavaScript ones
57:50 - chrome Academy black heaven let's grab
57:53 - your foot that work ok ok I think we're
57:56 - also ensures not to mention listening to
57:59 - get is critical to get through this
58:01 - second a lot of questions here for

58:19 - so the maneuver opportunity ask more
58:21 - questions and I guess it's our big call
58:24 - to action is make sure you got your hour
58:26 - of code ready to go that you've reserved
58:28 - a computer lab or otherwise built set up
58:30 - your plan for how you're going to get in
58:31 - front of your students and beauty our
58:33 - code recruit others if you're in a
58:36 - school get other teachers including if
