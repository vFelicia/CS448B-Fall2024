00:10 - sometimes we need to print information
00:13 - to the console
00:14 - this information could tell the user
00:16 - something like saying hello
00:19 - printing information about objects can
00:21 - also help us find errors and debug them
00:25 - in java we print to the console using
00:27 - system.out.print
00:30 - whatever is inside the parentheses is
00:33 - printed to the console
00:34 - for example if we wanted to print hello
00:37 - we can write hello and side quotation
00:39 - marks as the argument
00:42 - when we run our code we see hello
00:44 - displayed in the console
00:47 - we can also print the information that
00:49 - is returned from a method
00:51 - let's say we have a class called dog
00:54 - that has a method called get treat this
00:58 - method returns whether or not a dog
01:00 - object has a treat
01:02 - if we want to print whether or not a dog
01:04 - object called fido has a treat
01:07 - we call fido.gettreat
01:09 - insidethesystem.out.print
01:12 - when we run our code we see whether or
01:15 - not fido has a treat displayed in the
01:17 - console
01:19 - the value true by itself doesn't tell us
01:21 - much about what this means or represents
01:24 - we need to label this value using
01:26 - something called concatenation
01:29 - concatenation is joining two strings
01:31 - together
01:33 - we concatenate using the plus sign
01:35 - so if we want to first write the words
01:38 - fido has a treat and then display the
01:40 - status we can use the plus sign to
01:43 - concatenate these together
01:45 - now when we run our code we see the text
01:48 - final has treat and then the value
01:52 - let's make two objects
01:54 - one for fido
01:56 - and one for a new dog called max
01:59 - if we have multiple dog objects
02:02 - we can print the information for each
02:04 - one to the console
02:07 - but this displays everything as one line
02:09 - of text
02:11 - this is because system.out.print
02:14 - leaves the cursor at the end of the line
02:16 - that it printed
02:17 - we can use the system.out.println
02:21 - to print a line of text and then move
02:23 - the cursor to the next line
02:27 - now we see the information for each dog
02:29 - object printed on separate lines
02:33 - printing to the console is useful for
02:34 - debugging code and giving information to
02:37 - the user
02:38 - we can track the state of our objects as
02:40 - they execute tasks to easily identify
02:43 - possible errors
