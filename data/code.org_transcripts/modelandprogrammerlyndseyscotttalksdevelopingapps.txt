00:01 - I have two apps currently in the App
00:02 - Store there's educate it's an app for
00:05 - sponsoring Uganda news and there's Al
00:07 - also iort an app for models and actors
00:11 - and other uh artists to show off their
00:14 - portfolios how does it work uh well it
00:17 - allows the user to have a customized
00:19 - portfolio you can customize the table
00:21 - you can customize the book and you can
00:24 - edit the images in your portfolio so
00:26 - that you can have multiple portfolios
00:28 - and and show multiple portfolios for
00:30 - different castings how do you make money
00:32 - there is some advertising and there's
00:34 - also um an an inapp upgrade for $4.99
00:37 - you know what I want to know is how do
00:40 - you reconcile M the obvious difference
00:43 - between the two things that you do with
00:45 - your life on the one hand as a model
00:47 - you're an object right and on the other
00:51 - you're clearly somebody who's got some
00:52 - brain power who puts it to use
00:54 - developing apps as a model I've never
00:56 - felt like an object there's an artistic
00:58 - aspect to what I do uh you you put on
01:01 - these different outfits you become these
01:02 - different characters and you try to
01:04 - convey these different emotions and
01:05 - there's a creativity involved in that
01:07 - that's similar to the creativity that's
01:09 - involved when I'm making my apps
01:11 - matchmaker is your next project as I sit
01:13 - here across from you I think the last
01:15 - thing on Earth you need is a Matchmaker
01:18 - tell us out I don't know where your
01:20 - sources are but I I I like them a lot if
01:24 - they think that I'm I don't need this
01:25 - product uh it's hard being in New York
01:29 - and
01:30 - going out and meeting people who are
01:31 - like you it's very difficult so with the
01:35 - Matchmaker hang on a second a model like
01:38 - you re truly honestly you're having a
01:41 - hard time meeting somebody who's like
01:43 - yourself now I'm sure you're not looking
01:44 - for a male model who happens to be a
01:46 - computer geek in his spare time but mean
01:49 - really you're developing this app
01:51 - Matchmaker out of a sense of partly out
01:53 - of a sense of personal frustration when
01:55 - it's not easy in general but it's not
01:57 - just for love it's also for friendship
01:58 - and also for business so say you're at a
02:01 - bar or a business mixer or even just
02:02 - walking down the street you set your
02:04 - match criteria your profile information
02:07 - and your search radius and it will
02:09 - notify you when there are matches who
02:11 - are compatible with you in your IM
02:12 - mediate area how's that different from
02:14 - Tinder um for one it's more targeted and
02:17 - it'll notify you when there's someone in
02:19 - your vicinity so it it checks your
02:22 - personality and it checks the other
02:24 - people's personality in your area and
02:27 - it'll notify you specifically when this
02:29 - person
02:30 - is someone that you should be talking to
02:32 - so basically it's a way to promote real
02:35 - life social networking and prevent
02:37 - misconnections from happening it seemed
02:39 - like it would take an extraordinary
02:41 - amount of coding to create this app what
02:43 - went into it um I I'm very focused when
02:47 - I could so it took me only two months
02:49 - for this first version to do this
02:51 - particular app it relied heavily on some
02:53 - of iOS 7's new capabilities uh and so I
02:57 - had to research what io7 was capable of
03:00 - and incorporate that into my app I
03:02 - needed to put together a proximity
03:03 - algorithm I needed to put together a
03:05 - compatibility algorithm and I needed to
03:08 - um have a backend server to help support
03:11 - all this did you do all the coding
03:13 - yourself yes why is it that you think
03:16 - there aren't enough women coding we
03:17 - watch Rush masani and her girls who code
03:20 - initiative code academy is trying to
03:23 - attract women why don't more women want
03:25 - to Cod I think in general in our country
03:27 - we have a major issue of making computer
03:30 - science accessible in the first place
03:32 - it's only taught in one out of every 10
03:34 - high schools right now and computer
03:37 - programming is actually it really is a
03:39 - lot of fun and I challenge anyone who
03:41 - doesn't think that it's fun to try
03:43 - code.org hour of code and they have a
03:45 - drag and drop interface which will allow
03:48 - you to basically make your own program
03:51 - it's super important right now computer
03:53 - science jobs are growing twice as fast
03:55 - as the average job in our country and
03:58 - the fact that we have so few
04:00 - women and people of color involved it's
04:02 - a huge detriment to our society
