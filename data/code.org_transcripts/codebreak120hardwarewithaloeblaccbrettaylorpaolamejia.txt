01:28 - [Music]
02:05 - hello and welcome to code break my name
02:07 - is hadi i'm the founder of code.org in
02:09 - the hour of code
02:11 - and we're joined by lots of students on
02:13 - zoom on facebook live and on youtube
02:16 - live
02:17 - together we're hoping to build the
02:18 - world's largest live interactive
02:19 - classroom
02:20 - this is for many of us the last week of
02:22 - school for some people school is already
02:24 - over that's sophie this is your last day
02:26 - of school right yeah um so this will
02:29 - also be our last day of code break and
02:31 - i'm here with my daughter and sidekick
02:33 - sophia who's a budding computer
02:35 - scientist
02:36 - uh i also want to start before we
02:38 - mention the episode to mention that
02:40 - today uh is
02:41 - being a day that's called by uh
02:44 - universities and researchers around the
02:45 - world as shut down stem day which is a
02:48 - movement organized by black organizers
02:50 - and researchers to call on workers and
02:52 - representatives in science technology
02:54 - and math fields to work towards
02:56 - anti-racism
02:58 - uh we're very fortunate at code.org to
03:00 - have the platform to speak with you all
03:01 - about it until as we hold our last code
03:04 - break episode as a way to reach our
03:05 - younger students and recognize the
03:07 - anti-black racism that exists in the
03:09 - world and in stem fields and we need to
03:11 - do the work as a larger stem community
03:13 - to fight for black lives and for more
03:15 - diversity in the field of computer
03:17 - science
03:19 - to start today's episode i want to
03:21 - introduce two of our special guests
03:23 - one is paula
03:26 - paola are you there with us
03:28 - i'm here hi honey thank you so much for
03:29 - having me
03:31 - hi it's great to see you paulo as a
03:33 - senior software engineer at microsoft
03:35 - she's going to be joining us for the
03:36 - later part of the episode but you'll see
03:38 - her on screen uh and our first special
03:40 - guest is singer and songwriter aloe
03:43 - blacc
03:46 - i'm doing great how are you
03:47 - it's great to see you alon uh where are
03:50 - you calling us from i am in from los
03:53 - angeles today
03:55 - all right
03:57 - are you still stuck at home or is la
03:59 - able yeah we are still in quarantine
04:03 - we only go out for essentials
04:05 - here in seattle we have some restaurants
04:08 - opening at limited capacity you know
04:10 - it's uh hopefully people
04:13 - more and more around the world will get
04:14 - a chance to to get out a little bit at
04:16 - least over the summer but the pandemic
04:18 - really has not stopped and this is a
04:20 - disease that's going to be coming back i
04:21 - believe in the fall and winter so uh
04:23 - it's been a rough time for all of us
04:25 - do you have any message to share with
04:27 - students who are at home uh whether the
04:29 - ones who've been studying and still in
04:30 - school or thinking about their plans for
04:32 - the summer
04:33 - yeah i think this is a great summer to
04:35 - find
04:36 - what you might
04:38 - be passionate about so explore a lot of
04:40 - different things and since we're here
04:42 - and and you're here at code break maybe
04:45 - this is your passion
04:46 - try to build something amazing come up
04:48 - with some great ideas
04:51 - that's wonderful
04:53 - so we're going to start today's episode
04:55 - with the computer science joke of the
04:56 - day with sophia so sophia you want to
04:58 - share your your joke okay what is an
05:00 - astronaut's favorite key on the computer
05:03 - board on the computer keyboard
05:08 - so
05:11 - astronaut's favorite
05:13 - key on the computer keyboard
05:17 - i would say
05:20 - return because he can't wait to get back
05:22 - home
05:23 - that's a good
05:25 - the answer is the space bar oh my
05:28 - goodness of course of course the space
05:30 - bar yeah
05:32 - i should have thought of that
05:33 - at code.org we write our own jokes and
05:35 - sophia actually wrote a new joke uh when
05:37 - we were practicing today's episode so
05:39 - she has a second joke that today we're
05:42 - learning about hardware so you want to
05:44 - say your hardware-related joke it's a
05:45 - little
05:47 - tricky but what does the cpu call its
05:50 - mother the is a part of the computer
05:57 - so what does the central processing unit
05:59 - call its mother
06:02 - oh my goodness
06:04 - i'm gonna go for
06:07 - board
06:09 - i feel pretty close it's the motherboard
06:12 - [Laughter]
06:14 - motherboard
06:16 - the motherboard is actually the
06:18 - board of silicon that the cpu is
06:20 - installed on so it's actually a physical
06:22 - part of the computer
06:23 - all right well uh we now met our special
06:26 - guests let's start by saying hello to
06:28 - our uh the rest of our audience so can
06:30 - we show all the audience on screen and
06:32 - allo if you don't see them all you can
06:33 - hit the gallery button and zoom which
06:35 - will be in your upper right hand corner
06:39 - so you can see everybody if we could
06:40 - unmute everybody to say hello
06:50 - [Music]
06:56 - and there's a lot more students as well
06:58 - if you want to see the audience on
07:00 - screen and i'm actually going to share
07:01 - my screen so you can see where people
07:03 - are calling us from
07:06 - so if you see my screen share
07:10 - we have can you all see the map i have
07:12 - here
07:16 - all right so we have audience members as
07:18 - they were joining in basically scanning
07:20 - a qr code and telling us where they're
07:21 - calling from uh aloe i don't know if you
07:24 - expected to see people calling from
07:26 - hawaii some of these are i think fake
07:28 - locations whoever put in greenland i'm
07:30 - guessing is not actually calling from
07:32 - the middle of greenland but we have
07:33 - students from south america from africa
07:36 - from australia india uh and these are
07:38 - live so for many of them they're calling
07:40 - from the their late night or very early
07:42 - morning
07:43 - that's pretty amazing it's a lot of
07:45 - people
07:46 - yeah it's a lot of students from all
07:47 - over trying to learn to code with us
07:49 - together so we're so excited to have you
07:51 - on for our very last code break
07:53 - as we go through this episode if you
07:55 - have questions uh
07:58 - please submit them at code.org questions
08:00 - we're not sure with three special guests
08:02 - this time we're not sure how many uh
08:04 - questions we'll be able to field but
08:06 - also since this is our last code break
08:08 - we're also going to spend some time
08:09 - thanking all the parents and so if you
08:11 - want to give a shout out to your mom or
08:12 - dad you can also go to code.org
08:14 - questions and and put a shout out over
08:16 - there for your mom and dad
08:19 - for today's episode we're going to be
08:20 - talking about hardware and we have three
08:23 - different parts to talk about first
08:25 - we're going to talk about input and
08:26 - output next we're going to talk about
08:28 - the parts inside of a computer and
08:30 - lastly we're going to do some
08:31 - programming using circuits
08:36 - so
08:37 - before we go on to go into some today's
08:39 - lessons i want to welcome some of the
08:40 - students to demo their creations from
08:43 - last week last week we challenged
08:45 - students to make your own sprite live
08:48 - game or app lab drawing using functions
08:50 - and also in the previous week we asked
08:52 - you to use
08:54 - ai and machine learning to train a
08:55 - computer to recognize information so
08:58 - allo we're going to welcome some
08:59 - students who are going to demo what they
09:01 - built for us and if you could uh check
09:03 - them out and and hear from them can we
09:05 - unmute nick
09:13 - hi can you hear me
09:14 - yep we can hear you
09:16 - where are you calling from
09:18 - uh calgary canada
09:21 - calgary
09:22 - and what grade are you in
09:24 - i'm in grade 8.
09:25 - so i'm going to show what you created
09:28 - and so we can
09:29 - present it to aloe as well
09:32 - so nick basically worked on ai to
09:35 - basically do use computer vision and
09:36 - what you see here on the left hand side
09:39 - oops
09:40 - let me share it differently give me a
09:42 - second add
09:51 - [Music]
09:53 - what you see on the uh
09:55 - on the left hand side here is a computer
09:57 - vision recognizer he made that
09:59 - recognizes rock paper and scissors so as
10:02 - his hand shows paper the computer
10:04 - recognizes paper when his hand shows
10:06 - scissors
10:08 - and rock on the bottom it shows what the
10:10 - computer is seeing
10:11 - or this middle one shows him showing
10:13 - different facial expressions happy
10:16 - sad and angry and in the bottom you see
10:19 - what the computer is recognizing so he's
10:22 - trained the computer vision algorithm to
10:23 - to basically recognize his emotions
10:26 - and nick can you tell us what this is
10:27 - here on the right hand side the video
10:29 - you sent us
10:31 - uh so this one is um i made it recognize
10:35 - audio clips so the two i chose
10:38 - were for to recognize clapping and
10:40 - snapping
10:42 - all right cool so i'm gonna play the
10:43 - video and you're gonna
10:45 - clap and snap and the computer will tell
10:46 - those apart yep
10:49 - clap
10:52 - snap
10:56 - let me try that again that one really
10:58 - quickly clap
11:02 - snap
11:04 - right so the computer down below is
11:05 - listening to the sounds you make and
11:06 - recognizing and that's pretty cool
11:08 - thanks for learning how to use ai nick
11:12 - and the next student we wanted to uh
11:14 - welcome is
11:15 - sarvika
11:17 - sarvika are you there
11:22 - can we unmute sarvika for a second
11:29 - uh i think she dropped so i'm gonna demo
11:30 - starvika's project briefly and if she
11:33 - gets back i will say hello to her
11:35 - starvika is joining us from india so she
11:37 - might be dropping because it's super
11:39 - late at night for her uh but here we
11:42 - have the game that she created that was
11:44 - built in game lab
11:45 - and it was modeled after the game we
11:47 - created with a rabbit that is feeding
11:48 - carrots to make carrots do but you can
11:51 - control this
11:52 - little
11:53 - scientist
11:54 - and have them drop tools to fix
11:56 - computers
11:58 - and then there's like a bad robot and if
12:00 - the tool gets eaten by the robot you
12:01 - lose
12:02 - so it's kind of a hard game oh no uh am
12:06 - i audible i'm cervical oh hi cervica
12:09 - we're playing
12:10 - i dropped out
12:12 - no worries where are you calling us from
12:14 - i'm from india noida
12:16 - all right and what grade are you in
12:19 - i'm in grade eight
12:20 - great eights well i just played your
12:22 - game and i i wasn't very good at it so i
12:25 - got a game over but thank you so much
12:27 - by the way the code that sarvika wrote
12:29 - there's a lot of lines of code here you
12:31 - can see on the right hand side to make
12:33 - this game in game lab we had made it
12:35 - last week in sprite lab which is much
12:37 - much easier so our whole team at
12:39 - code.org was pretty impressed for for
12:42 - building all of this inside game lab so
12:44 - congratulations for building something
12:46 - uh
12:48 - advanced
12:50 - uh aloe are you there with us too still
12:59 - there you go how you doing
13:01 - right there you are all right so uh
13:04 - thank you again sophia if you could play
13:05 - an applause sound for both starvika and
13:07 - for nick and for all of our students who
13:09 - made
13:10 - special creations last week
13:12 - let's get into today's lesson
13:14 - our word of the day today is hardware
13:19 - and today what we're going to talk about
13:21 - is basically what is hardware and how
13:23 - does it work
13:24 - hardware is basically the physical stuff
13:26 - that is inside of a computer not just
13:28 - inside it but even outside it it's
13:30 - basically the physical parts that work
13:32 - together to make a computer so you may
13:34 - have heard of some of these parts like
13:35 - the cpu which means the central
13:37 - processing unit or the memory which is
13:39 - also called as ram and so on
13:42 - but before we go into hardware i want to
13:45 - talk about what are examples of what a
13:47 - computer even is uh and i want to chat
13:51 - with some of the students to to learn
13:52 - more about it so uh can we unmute uh
13:56 - josiah in north carolina actually i'm
13:58 - gonna mute you myself
14:02 - hottie
14:03 - hi there
14:04 - is nc does that mean you're calling from
14:05 - north carolina uh yes
14:09 - right so can i ask you what are examples
14:11 - of computers besides a laptop what other
14:14 - things do you ever work with that are
14:15 - computers
14:17 - uh you mean like huh
14:21 - i work with apple tv
14:24 - apple tv is a computer
14:26 - aloe can you think of examples of things
14:27 - that are computers besides just laptops
14:30 - yes sometimes i walk around with a
14:32 - computer in my pocket that's my phone
14:35 - that's right your cell phone
14:37 - how about you sofia
14:39 - um
14:41 - an ipad an ipad is a computer if you
14:43 - have a smart watch that's a computer
14:46 - but also if you have a navigation system
14:48 - in your mom or dad's car
14:50 - that's a computer the satellites that go
14:52 - around the world in space like on anuj's
14:55 - background screen
14:57 - those are computers
14:58 - if you have smart screens on your
15:00 - microwave or on your uh
15:02 - or you know on your fridge that's a
15:05 - computer
15:06 - and if you've ever seen if you've ever
15:07 - seen a calculator
15:09 - that's actually a computer every
15:11 - calculator is a computer uh in our very
15:14 - first episode of code break hill harper
15:16 - walked us into his shower that had a
15:18 - touch screen and that was a computer
15:20 - most modern medical equipment uses
15:22 - computers
15:24 - today the smallest computers could be so
15:26 - small that they're microscopic you
15:28 - literally can't even see it with your
15:30 - eyes and their computers
15:31 - so the question i want to ask is what
15:34 - makes a computer a computer what defines
15:37 - that something is a computer versus
15:38 - something else every computer has four
15:42 - things and what these four things have
15:43 - to do generally with are processing
15:46 - information
15:47 - it first takes an input
15:49 - then it stores that information
15:52 - it processes the information and then
15:54 - converts it into output of some sort
15:57 - inputs means sort of the physical
15:58 - world's telling something to the
16:00 - computer then it processes and works
16:02 - that input into some other form of
16:04 - information and then outputs that
16:06 - now that could mean like doing math or
16:09 - changing something by words but there's
16:11 - lots of different ways to give
16:13 - input to a computer you might click a
16:15 - key on the keyboard so can we think of
16:18 - different ways you can give input to a
16:19 - computer at kayleen i'm going to call on
16:22 - you kayleen can you hear me
16:25 - yeah i can hear you all right so can you
16:27 - think of other ways you can give input
16:29 - to a computer
16:30 - besides touching on a keyboard
16:34 - well there are touch screen computers
16:36 - like you can touch on the screen but um
16:40 - those touch screen computers are more
16:42 - expensive than the keyboard ones and
16:45 - they're more easier to use some other
16:48 - computers you can flip them to tablets
16:50 - and things like that exactly so the
16:52 - touch screen that feels your touch
16:54 - that's an input device can anybody share
16:57 - another type of input into a computer
17:01 - all right uh alexander
17:06 - oops
17:09 - yes
17:10 - yep where are you calling from
17:12 - oshkosh wisconsin all right so what's
17:14 - another example of a computer input
17:19 - pretty much with like um like coding
17:23 - with like websites because when you like
17:25 - let's say like you want to like
17:28 - pick like an item from like a computer
17:30 - you have to
17:32 - like um
17:34 - you have to like search up the item
17:37 - and
17:38 - they'll show you
17:40 - to show you on some like items that are
17:43 - so when you're using the website it
17:45 - wants you to give information and you
17:46 - could use your keyboard to type that
17:48 - information but is there some other
17:50 - thing you can use like when if you want
17:52 - to give it if you want to choose
17:53 - something from a drop down menu what do
17:55 - you use to choose to make that selection
17:59 - what are you moving around
18:01 - you the mouse
18:02 - the mouse exactly the mouse so uh thank
18:06 - you so much alexander so
18:07 - input devices for computer all the
18:10 - things that take something from the
18:11 - physical world the world of touch the
18:13 - world of sound the world of light so the
18:16 - camera on a phone that's taking input
18:19 - the microphone on a phone or computer
18:22 - that's taking input you speak to it or
18:23 - it hears noise and that receives that
18:26 - information whether it's touch
18:28 - sound
18:29 - site
18:30 - even things like the gps locator on your
18:33 - phone it's locating where you are in the
18:35 - world these are all inputs and then the
18:37 - computer uses that information to output
18:39 - something
18:41 - aloe can you give us an example of what
18:43 - are some ways a computer can output
18:44 - information
18:46 - yeah um well i make music so i love the
18:49 - speakers on a computer that's my
18:51 - favorite part of output on a computer
18:53 - sometimes but i also make music videos
18:56 - so
18:57 - um the screen is an output and it's
19:01 - offering the information
19:03 - uh through that output
19:05 - yep so the sights and sounds you get
19:06 - from a computer or from your phone are
19:08 - output but there's again many types of
19:10 - output like on sophia's phone here
19:12 - there's a flashlight that makes light or
19:15 - if you have a computer that's
19:16 - controlling physical
19:17 - equipment the output can control that
19:20 - like if your car has a smart braking
19:22 - system
19:23 - the output of the computers the brakes
19:25 - on the car or if you have a robot uh the
19:28 - movement of that robot is controlled by
19:30 - the output of a computer or if a
19:32 - computer is inside maybe a microwave uh
19:34 - it turns on or off the microwave that's
19:36 - the output every computer does these
19:39 - four things of taking in input
19:42 - storing and processing it and then
19:44 - outputting and that input can be light
19:46 - or sight or touch and the output can be
19:49 - sound or sights and so on now i want to
19:52 - do something unique we're going to act
19:53 - out the different parts of the computer
19:55 - today with all the students on camera
19:58 - so in the background we're going to have
19:59 - this screen share that shows all of you
20:01 - on screen
20:02 - and what we're going to do is we're
20:03 - going to have
20:04 - five different computers on screen at so
20:08 - basically
20:09 - each of you in one of these vertical
20:10 - columns that you see is going to be a
20:12 - computer consisting of four people so
20:18 - we see five computers each one is a
20:20 - vertical row uh and so that's computer
20:23 - number one is started with me and sophia
20:27 - computer number two is with naomi
20:29 - and so on and so forth
20:33 - and the top row is going to be input
20:36 - the second row is going to be storage
20:40 - the third row
20:41 - is going to be processing and the fourth
20:44 - row is going to be output so
20:48 - look look at where you will look at
20:49 - where you are in the computer on the
20:51 - screen and you'll see which computer
20:54 - number uh column you fall under and
20:56 - you'll see what part of the pr um
20:59 - the computing stage
21:01 - you are in the on the roads
21:03 - right
21:04 - so alexander who's raising his hand he's
21:06 - part of the processing for computer
21:08 - number three yep
21:10 - or aloe is
21:11 - part of computer number three storage
21:14 - so all right so now all of our computers
21:16 - are going to do something so if you're
21:18 - in the input row
21:20 - i want you to grab a piece of paper
21:22 - and also if you're in the in a pen and
21:24 - if you're in the output row also grab a
21:27 - piece of paper and a pen so if you grab
21:29 - a piece of paper because we're part of
21:30 - input for computer number one
21:33 - so
21:34 - we're using paper because the original
21:37 - computers and this the first computers
21:38 - used paper as their only way of input
21:41 - and output before there were microphones
21:43 - and cameras and even keyboards on a
21:46 - computer the earliest computers you fed
21:48 - them information on a card with little
21:50 - holes in it and then they printed out
21:52 - information after they very true and
21:54 - that's those were the machine the
21:55 - machine computers that the word computer
21:59 - is basically referring to a human being
22:01 - who would compute information so if you
22:04 - were the person to do the work you were
22:06 - called the computer
22:09 - yep
22:09 - exactly so what i want everybody in the
22:12 - input row i want you to use your pen to
22:15 - pick a number between one through five
22:17 - and draw that many dots on your paper
22:20 - make them big dots so that we can see
22:22 - them when you hold them up to the camera
22:24 - sophia can you draw one of these
22:26 - so any number
22:28 - a number between one to five don't make
22:30 - it too big of a number because
22:33 - because that's too many dots and make
22:35 - them thick dots so that when you hold
22:37 - them up to the camera we can see them
22:40 - [Music]
22:43 - all right
22:44 - sophia can you show your number good job
22:46 - zion
22:48 - thank you nikki
22:51 - great job naomi
22:54 - all right
22:56 - so all right come on thank you right
22:58 - we've got all these numbers on screen so
23:00 - everybody who's in storage
23:02 - i want you to use your fingers to show
23:04 - how many dots you see from the input
23:05 - above you
23:07 - so look at the number above you and hold
23:09 - up that number of dots and hold them up
23:11 - using your fingers and make sure we see
23:13 - them
23:13 - now if you're holding up your hand to
23:15 - show the dots
23:16 - make sure you keep your hand up don't
23:18 - bring it down
23:19 - your job is to remember what was there
23:22 - so even when the dots disappear keep
23:24 - your hand up all right
23:26 - all right so now can the dots go away
23:30 - all the pieces of paper i want you to
23:32 - write down a new number of dots
23:35 - pick a different number you can maybe
23:37 - add a
23:38 - and again pick a number between one to
23:40 - five the hands-on screen don't don't
23:42 - bring your hands down because you're
23:43 - still remembering the previous number
23:47 - so let's see a new number on screen
23:51 - okay sophia has one dot
24:02 - all right
24:03 - nikki can you hold yours down just a bit
24:05 - so we can see
24:07 - there you go
24:08 - all right so can whoever is doing the
24:11 - drawings on the screen stop doing that
24:12 - right so now uh for everybody who's in
24:15 - processing the third row of the computer
24:18 - take a look at the number you see in
24:20 - storage
24:21 - which is the one the row the second row
24:24 - and then look at the new inputs and add
24:26 - them together so you see one number
24:28 - that's being stored in memory which is
24:30 - the first time we hold up the dots then
24:33 - a new number which is the new input and
24:35 - add these two together and show that
24:37 - with your fingers on the screen
24:40 - so you see for example sophia is holding
24:43 - one dot and right above her kayleen is
24:46 - showing
24:46 - three fingers
24:48 - so one plus three is four
24:52 - and naomi is showing two dots
24:55 - and
24:56 - power lies
24:58 - that's your one dot right so now
25:00 - everybody who's basically doing
25:02 - processing is showing a new number
25:04 - alexander can you hold your number up
25:06 - higher so we can see it
25:09 - okay you're gonna alexander i'm holding
25:12 - up three because that's the memory that
25:13 - was in storage
25:15 - and nicki's holding up two because
25:17 - that's the new number
25:19 - so you have to add those together two
25:21 - plus three there you go
25:24 - thanks alex
25:26 - all right so we all have numbers showing
25:28 - so now the dots can stop showing their
25:30 - inputs and what i want but for the
25:32 - processing folks don't change your
25:33 - numbers now if you're an output
25:36 - now write down the number you see in
25:37 - processing right above you
25:39 - so
25:40 - and people in processing make sure your
25:41 - numbers are very obvious if folks can
25:43 - write down
25:44 - and write it down as a number not as
25:46 - dots so if you see the number four you
25:48 - write down the number four
25:55 - and
25:57 - all right so anjali is writing down six
26:03 - great job kate
26:05 - all right and kate wrote down the number
26:08 - five
26:16 - all right
26:17 - well thank you so much guys so uh i
26:19 - think somebody just dropped off the
26:21 - camera which kind of changes this a
26:23 - little bit for us
26:24 - so what we just did is we showed the
26:26 - different parts of a computer basically
26:27 - involve inputting information which in
26:29 - our case the input was a piece of paper
26:32 - remembering that information which said
26:33 - even if the paper changed you remember
26:35 - what's going on
26:36 - processing that information
26:38 - in our case we just did very simple
26:40 - addition
26:41 - and then getting the results and
26:42 - outputting them and the output we did
26:44 - was with paper now we did this with pen
26:46 - and paper but the inputs and outputs of
26:48 - a computer can be completely different
26:50 - the input could be a sound you get from
26:52 - the microphone and then you record that
26:54 - sound inside the computer in the memory
26:56 - and the processing of that sound could
26:58 - be like a you know changing the volume
27:00 - or remixing it and then outputting the
27:03 - sound comes out for the speakers
27:05 - everything a computer does and what
27:07 - defines what a computer is is those four
27:09 - things of input
27:11 - storing information
27:13 - processing that information and
27:14 - outputting it and every computer whether
27:17 - it's a tablet a gaming desktop a phone
27:20 - the car gps system all of those do those
27:23 - same four things we have an entire video
27:26 - series about how computers work that
27:28 - goes into a lot more detail and we're
27:29 - going to share that at the end of this
27:31 - episode for folks to watch it's about 50
27:33 - minutes of videos and it features bill
27:35 - gates himself who created one of the
27:37 - most popular computer operating systems
27:39 - ever to explain to you that
27:41 - these parts of a computer and how they
27:43 - work
27:45 - so uh before we say goodbye to aloe i
27:48 - want to uh do a lightning round with you
27:49 - aloe so aloe you're our sixth and final
27:52 - special guest to play our lightning
27:54 - round game uh sophia is going to put 60
27:57 - seconds on the clock and she's going to
27:59 - keep score you're going to be getting a
28:01 - bunch of quick questions and your goal
28:03 - is to see how many questions you can
28:04 - answer in 60 seconds okay our high score
28:07 - was set by macklemore who got 14 answers
28:10 - uh in in 60 seconds oh my goodness yeah
28:14 - it's kind of hard it's pretty high
28:15 - stress but i'm sure you'll do okay
28:17 - sophie you ready yes aloe you ready yes
28:20 - all right go
28:22 - what are your feelings about pineapple
28:24 - on pizza
28:26 - i love it
28:27 - something you can't every no matter how
28:29 - many people love it
28:31 - jalapenos
28:32 - your favorite smell
28:35 - jasmine
28:36 - your favorite article of clothing
28:38 - hat
28:40 - strangest thing in your refrigerator
28:46 - hummus
28:48 - something you wish you could have
28:49 - learned as a kid
28:52 - coding
28:53 - what's your best advice you've ever
28:55 - gotten
28:58 - study the greats
29:00 - as a kid what did you want to be when
29:01 - you grew up
29:03 - a neuroscientist
29:06 - what is the superhero power you wish you
29:08 - had
29:10 - automatically create food
29:13 - first thing you do in the morning
29:16 - check my email
29:18 - what were your hobbies when you were a
29:20 - kid
29:22 - riding bikes
29:23 - um
29:24 - okay you got 10 which is really good all
29:27 - right great
29:29 - that's great and by the way aloe meant
29:31 - you mentioned that you wanted to learn
29:32 - coding but aloe's actually one of the
29:34 - reasons we've highlighted aloe not only
29:36 - in this episode but on on many code
29:38 - videos as well is because
29:40 - when the internet first came out allah
29:42 - was one of the first musicians to create
29:44 - his own website and to use that to
29:46 - promote his music and it's an important
29:47 - lesson that even if you want to become a
29:49 - rock star or an athlete whatever field
29:52 - you want to go into understanding how
29:53 - technology works is super important as
29:56 - well
29:58 - thank you
30:00 - um so alan i know we're out of time and
30:03 - we're running late for your schedules
30:04 - can we switch to gallery view and have
30:06 - everybody say goodbye to aloe as we add
30:08 - yvonne with our episode
30:09 - [Applause]
30:13 - bye everybody thank you
30:15 - all right it's been a pleasure
30:16 - thank you so happy learning
30:18 - bye bye
30:20 - before we welcome our next special guest
30:22 - i want to take a quick break for a
30:24 - short trivia question so it's trip video
30:26 - time
30:28 - so the question is what does the acronym
30:30 - bios
30:32 - stand for bios and if you're not on the
30:36 - zoom call the options are
30:38 - booting info on startup
30:40 - the next option is
30:41 - basic input output system
30:44 - the third option is bytes in operating
30:46 - system
30:48 - and the fourth option is begin input
30:50 - output scan
30:53 - right so almost half of our audience has
30:55 - already voted on these so what does the
30:57 - acronym bios stand for all right it
31:00 - sounds like most people got this right
31:01 - if we could share the results on screen
31:04 - almost all of you got it correct
31:06 - so the basic input output system uh what
31:09 - that is or the bios of a computer it's
31:12 - like the operating system but it's at a
31:14 - much more detailed sort of lower level
31:17 - thing basically the bios is the little
31:20 - bit of code that runs
31:22 - the immediate moment when you turn on a
31:24 - computer when you immediately turn on
31:25 - the phone it's the thing that tests to
31:28 - make sure that all the inputs and
31:30 - outputs work that there is a keyboard
31:31 - that the memory actually exists that the
31:34 - wires are actually working and so on and
31:36 - once this step is complete it then
31:39 - actually loads the real operating system
31:41 - which could be windows or android or ios
31:44 - and then passes control of the computer
31:46 - to the operating system which then takes
31:48 - over and manages everything that happens
31:51 - so i want to welcome our second special
31:53 - guest at today brett are you here with
31:55 - us i'm here
31:57 - hi brett it's great to see you where are
31:59 - you calling us from uh calling from
32:01 - lafayette california which is uh right
32:03 - next to oakland california if any of you
32:05 - know where that is
32:07 - uh well i know where that is but uh i
32:09 - wanted to ask sort is is where you at
32:11 - are people out and about yet are you
32:13 - still in quarantine mode are you staying
32:15 - at home or can you get together we're
32:16 - still sheltering in place um though some
32:19 - businesses are opening up so um it's a
32:21 - little bit more normal than it was
32:23 - though uh still you know the kids are i
32:26 - have three kids uh 10 uh eight and five
32:29 - and um a lot of their summer activities
32:32 - are still at home
32:34 - yeah it's rough to be spending summer at
32:36 - home
32:37 - uh brett by the way for those of you who
32:39 - didn't read our introductions is
32:40 - currently the president of salesforce he
32:42 - used to be the chief technology officer
32:44 - of facebook and he's also the co-creator
32:47 - and inventor of google maps
32:49 - which i know i use pretty much every day
32:51 - at least when i'm not sheltering in
32:53 - place or quarantining
32:55 - brett can you share us a little bit
32:56 - about your involvement with google maps
32:58 - how old were you when you were working
32:59 - on google maps uh and can you tell us a
33:02 - little bit about the the project that
33:03 - got that going yeah sure i was i was 25
33:06 - years old when we launched google maps
33:08 - and
33:09 - actually 24 years old
33:11 - turned 25 a couple months after
33:13 - so
33:14 - really it was at my first job right out
33:17 - of university i'm at google and
33:20 - for me when i think about it i think
33:22 - that most of the really cool
33:24 - products that you use um that are
33:27 - created by code are done by teams
33:29 - and it was interesting when i i feel
33:32 - really proud that i helped make google
33:33 - maps because so many people around the
33:35 - world use it now hundreds of millions of
33:37 - people use it but it was really a whole
33:39 - team that did it we had one engineer on
33:41 - the team named jens who was really good
33:43 - at drawing um so he was responsible for
33:46 - all the way the maps looked um which you
33:48 - know at the time was uh i think was one
33:50 - of the most beautiful maps and it really
33:52 - helped people want to use google maps
33:54 - over some of the other mapping
33:56 - technologies at the time my friend jim
33:59 - he was best at algorithms
34:01 - and so he designed the algorithm that
34:03 - helped make driving directions work so
34:06 - when you say you know i want to go from
34:08 - san francisco to new york you can
34:10 - imagine how many different ways you
34:12 - could do that how many different roads
34:13 - you could drive on he came up with a way
34:15 - to find the best route to take into
34:17 - account how fast the highways were the
34:20 - different speed limits really really
34:22 - complicated math and he was the best at
34:24 - that
34:25 - and i spent a lot of time on the user
34:26 - interface which is really
34:28 - i think a fun topic you're talking about
34:30 - inputs and outputs
34:32 - i um wrote all the code that um so when
34:35 - you took your mouse and you dragged the
34:37 - map i made it move in the right way um
34:39 - and that was really my specialty
34:41 - and on the other side of that the team
34:42 - of about five of us made google maps and
34:46 - now there's a much bigger team working
34:47 - on it but it was one of those fun coding
34:49 - projects of my life
34:52 - it's pretty awesome if only five people
34:53 - made the first version and pretty much
34:55 - everything we use in technology that we
34:58 - sort of society upholds sort of
35:00 - individuals as the inventors but they're
35:02 - always made by teams of people behind
35:03 - them doing different parts
35:05 - and since today we're learning about the
35:07 - different parts of a computer such as
35:08 - input and output one thing that made
35:10 - google maps special before all the other
35:12 - compared to all the maps that came
35:14 - before it is
35:15 - in the past anytime you wanted to move
35:17 - the map the entire map would need to
35:19 - load start to bottom and you couldn't
35:22 - even move your mouse left and right to
35:23 - drag the mouse drag the map
35:26 - we are now accustomed the idea on a
35:27 - touch screen you touch and you move it
35:29 - and you give it the input and then the
35:31 - output which is the monitor shows
35:33 - basically the map scrolling and google
35:35 - maps was really the first version that
35:37 - did that uh and when it happened and
35:39 - people saw that for the first time was a
35:41 - pretty magical experience that now you
35:42 - take for granted yeah i mean what's so
35:45 - fun about talking about input and output
35:47 - is it sounds so simple but honestly it's
35:49 - the most important part of the way we
35:51 - work with computers
35:53 - you know back when hottie and i started
35:56 - coding the way you
35:58 - talk to a computer was just through a
36:00 - text interface so you typed on a
36:02 - keyboard and you saw text come back on
36:04 - the screen
36:06 - and then
36:07 - it became a graphical user interface so
36:09 - you could see pictures on the screen and
36:11 - you could use a mouse along with a
36:13 - keyboard to both input things into
36:15 - computer and see the output
36:17 - and that was really as you said hottie
36:19 - with google maps we realized you know
36:21 - the modern mapping systems weren't
36:23 - taking advantage of all these new ways
36:25 - that you could input and output data
36:27 - from the computer and when we thought of
36:29 - a creative new way of doing it it really
36:31 - changed mapping forever but actually the
36:34 - most interesting part of google maps
36:35 - wasn't even created by us i think was
36:37 - created by steve jobs who is the um
36:39 - obviously the founder of apple um who
36:42 - makes iphones like this one right here
36:45 - you know when they introduced this they
36:46 - introduced a new way to input into a
36:48 - computer which was your finger and i
36:50 - think i can say that the moment i took
36:52 - my finger and dragged a google map i
36:54 - thought wow this is the coolest thing
36:56 - i've ever seen in my life and so you
36:58 - know i think when you think about all
37:00 - the cool things you're going to make
37:01 - with code a lot of the new experiences
37:04 - we make are because of new ways of input
37:06 - and new ways of output and i'm really
37:09 - excited about virtual reality i'm really
37:11 - excited about
37:13 - you know new forms of user interfaces
37:16 - being created all around the world right
37:17 - now and i think the way you all will
37:19 - code for computers 10 years from now is
37:21 - going to be really different than the
37:22 - computers of today and that's pretty
37:24 - exciting
37:25 - so we're going to learn a little bit
37:28 - about the graphical user interface
37:29 - inside coding which has also changed a
37:31 - lot and i know that your kids use
37:33 - code.org we're going to switch to uh
37:35 - codingoncode.org to
37:37 - complete a game that sophie and i are
37:38 - gonna be coding uh to basically learn
37:41 - about the parts inside of a computer so
37:43 - i'm gonna share my screen and what you
37:45 - see here is code.org sprite lab
37:47 - and we've started this game with these
37:49 - really cool graphics that we're very
37:52 - very proud of and this kind of fancy
37:54 - looking computer that we're gonna put
37:56 - together and if i run the game
37:58 - i can put the different parts inside the
38:00 - computer so this here is the cpu on its
38:03 - motherboard
38:05 - and this here is a memory
38:07 - and brett can you
38:08 - find any input devices that i can attach
38:11 - to this computer yeah why don't we start
38:13 - with maybe the keyboard
38:15 - the keyboard is one of the inputs
38:18 - all right
38:19 - any other input devices i think a mouse
38:21 - is a good input device that's another
38:23 - input device
38:25 - and
38:26 - as output we have this little black
38:28 - thing which is our monitor
38:30 - doesn't really look like a monitor but
38:31 - the screen on your laptop is black until
38:33 - you turn it on uh and that's basically
38:36 - the output that shows what's on your
38:37 - screen
38:38 - uh
38:39 - and then this last part is the power
38:40 - cord but we can't drag it because this
38:42 - part doesn't work yet and i want to turn
38:45 - the computer on by clicking on it but
38:46 - that doesn't work because it doesn't
38:47 - have any power
38:49 - so that's the part that sophia and i are
38:50 - going to be coding right now
38:52 - so i'm going to stop this for a second
38:54 - and before we get into the coding i
38:56 - wanted to point out that this little
38:58 - thing here was not even draggable
39:01 - all the other sprites on the screen were
39:03 - draggable and the way that happened is
39:05 - something that happened in the starter
39:06 - code here when you see reset game
39:09 - this is basically a function we wrote
39:11 - last week we learned about abstraction
39:12 - and how functions can have lots of code
39:15 - inside them so if i click the edit
39:17 - button here you can see all of the code
39:20 - that goes into starting the game
39:22 - uh you don't need to know what all this
39:24 - code does it basically sets things up
39:26 - but sophia if you go to the very very
39:28 - bottom it makes all the sprites on the
39:30 - screen draggable so the keyboard is
39:32 - draggable and the mouse is draggable and
39:34 - so on but the power unit is not
39:36 - draggable so go into behaviors
39:40 - and then say sprite begins
39:43 - and
39:44 - add that in there and now you can make
39:46 - rabbit draggable but not the reaction
39:49 - but not the rabbit yeah let's make the
39:50 - power unit draggable
39:52 - and then go into behaviors
39:54 - and say
39:55 - being draggable
39:56 - so now your power unit is draggable
40:00 - oops
40:03 - it's glitchy is it glitching for you
40:06 - right now hit close
40:10 - all right and now hit start so we can
40:14 - yes hit run so we can see if the power
40:16 - unit is draggable
40:19 - right draggable but it's not clicking
40:21 - into place like those other things did
40:23 - so let's write the code to make it click
40:26 - right so if you look on the screen it
40:27 - shows what happens right now when the
40:29 - memory chip touches the computer
40:33 - i'm going to refresh the screen share
40:34 - because
40:35 - it's glitching a little bit for people
40:37 - so i'm going to start this over give me
40:39 - just one second
40:40 - i'm going to stop the show can i share a
40:42 - story about building a computer
40:44 - sure go ahead yeah so when i was a kid
40:47 - um i couldn't afford a computer
40:51 - from a computer store
40:53 - but it was cheaper if i bought all the
40:54 - parts of a computer and i built it
40:56 - myself so if i bought the memory and i
40:58 - bought the cpu and i bought the case
41:02 - and the first time i did it i had this
41:03 - exact same top problem hottie which is i
41:06 - finished doing it and i screwed it in
41:08 - with a screwdriver and i turned it on
41:10 - and it didn't work and i had to take the
41:11 - entire thing apart and i had forgotten
41:13 - to connect the power supply to the cpu
41:17 - and the computer wouldn't turn on and so
41:19 - one it's one engineering principle that
41:21 - i think is really important is always
41:23 - test the entire way
41:26 - you know when you're writing code don't
41:27 - wait to the end to
41:29 - see if your code's working always run it
41:31 - and see what happens
41:32 - i learned that the hard way when i was
41:34 - building my first computer a true story
41:36 - that's wonderful yeah and that's why we
41:38 - tested at the mouse that the power unit
41:40 - was draggable
41:42 - before we jumped into doing anything
41:43 - else
41:44 - and i hope this works right now so i'm
41:46 - going to run this code again and we can
41:48 - drag the power unit but it doesn't click
41:50 - into place but at least the code that we
41:52 - wrote does something so now if you look
41:55 - at this code here this shows what
41:56 - happens how we make it lock into place
41:58 - we want to do something like this which
42:00 - is how the memory locks into place so
42:02 - we're going to recreate something like
42:03 - that so start with creating an event
42:05 - block
42:06 - and so you see when the rabbit touches
42:08 - the carrot
42:10 - but we don't have a rabbit or a cat but
42:11 - we can say when the power unit
42:14 - touches the computer we want to make it
42:16 - click into place
42:20 - yeah someone's drawing so what happens
42:23 - when the power unit touches the computer
42:25 - first thing we want to do is make it
42:26 - stop being draggable
42:36 - and then
42:37 - being draggable
42:39 - yep
42:40 - but right now you said make the rabbit
42:41 - stop being grabbable
42:46 - [Music]
42:49 - and then the other thing we want to do
42:50 - is we want to have it jump and lock into
42:53 - place see how it says jump this memory
42:55 - unit jumps to a location so go into
42:58 - actions
43:00 - and have
43:02 - the sprite
43:04 - jump
43:05 - and instead of a random location we want
43:07 - to pick our own location
43:08 - so go into locations
43:10 - and see that little thing with a pin in
43:12 - it
43:13 - it's right in the middle
43:16 - click that and choose a location kind of
43:18 - halfway between the power
43:21 - yeah a little bit yeah that's that's a
43:23 - good location
43:25 - over there yep that's good
43:27 - so now let's hit run and see if that
43:29 - works
43:34 - it's glitching
43:36 - oh did it lock in a bad place
43:38 - i'm gonna
43:44 - oh it's because you have the rabbit
43:45 - jumping
43:47 - we need to make this be the power unit
43:48 - so this is exactly as brad said we need
43:51 - to test every step of the way
43:53 - i'm glad we tested to see what the
43:54 - problem was there so if we hit run now
43:58 - click run again
44:00 - and you can move it and it jumps into
44:02 - place perfect but we want to make a
44:04 - sound when it jumps into place as well
44:07 - so
44:08 - can you go into the world and choose
44:10 - play sound
44:15 - all right
44:16 - and now we can choose a sound
44:19 - all right let's gonna choose a digital
44:21 - sound so we have let's pick some of
44:23 - these choices play the ring one
44:27 - and then start up
44:30 - play the whistle
44:32 - and the win
44:34 - all right
44:34 - we're going to choose one of these
44:35 - sounds brett do you have a favorite and
44:38 - let's also pull the entire i like the
44:40 - win that made me laugh
44:42 - all right let's house the whole audience
44:44 - and we'll play the sounds and so we can
44:46 - choose uh so
44:48 - ring startup
44:52 - whistle
44:55 - and win
44:58 - all right
45:00 - and let's share the audience poll
45:01 - results
45:04 - i think everybody else agreed with you
45:05 - brett uh so we're gonna go with the win
45:10 - right uh
45:11 - and then the last thing we want to do is
45:13 - we can actually uh if you look what is
45:15 - happening here when we're adding these
45:17 - commands if you look above there's a
45:19 - command here that says change parts by
45:21 - one what that's doing is incrementing a
45:24 - variable which is something we learned a
45:26 - few weeks ago and if the reason is doing
45:28 - that it's counting how many parts we put
45:30 - inside the computer because at the end
45:33 - we're going to test and see if parts
45:35 - reaches 6 we'll let the computer turn on
45:38 - so basically we need to increase this
45:40 - variable as well so we're going to need
45:42 - to choose one of the variable codes to
45:44 - change
45:47 - change parts by one um
45:49 - and i think that's good you hit the run
45:51 - button
45:53 - now this should all work
45:55 - put the other parts in
46:00 - the inputs
46:02 - the outputs we got the storage of
46:04 - processing and then put the power
46:07 - and now you can turn on the computer yay
46:10 - yay it all
46:12 - works
46:14 - yeah we can i wanted to leave that for
46:15 - the audience to do later so there's lots
46:17 - of things you can add to this
46:19 - first of all you can change the look and
46:21 - feel of the power unit once it's
46:22 - connected we have a little costume you
46:24 - can change
46:26 - light up and show power uh but we're
46:28 - going to share this app with you
46:30 - so you can
46:31 - actually sophie you can do that right
46:32 - now while i'm talking about it so you
46:34 - can add the costume if you want um so
46:37 - this app that we just made is very
46:39 - simple but we're going to let you extend
46:40 - it so you can add other computer parts
46:42 - you can have other sort of parts like
46:45 - more memory and so on you can add other
46:47 - inputs and outputs
46:49 - and if you want to do something advanced
46:50 - you can actually go go further and make
46:52 - an actual smartphone version of this so
46:54 - you put the parts inside of a smartphone
46:56 - together and we'll send that to you as
46:58 - part of your challenges
47:01 - the other cool thing and brad i don't
47:02 - know if you've seen this is we can share
47:04 - this out to everybody so this app that
47:06 - we made
47:07 - we're going to share and if you see that
47:09 - little qr code if you have a phone with
47:11 - you which bret i saw that you had you
47:13 - can scan that qr code on that on your
47:15 - phone right now
47:17 - and you'll get a little notification so
47:18 - you need to turn on your phone's camera
47:20 - and then if you just hold it up to that
47:23 - qr code it'll show a little notification
47:25 - and then you can
47:26 - get the app that we just put together
47:29 - that's awesome
47:31 - yeah and then you can play it on your
47:32 - own computer you can play it on your own
47:34 - and it works just like we just did so
47:36 - you can
47:37 - have fun making a computer and this time
47:39 - don't forget to connect the power supply
47:41 - and it'll start working
47:49 - so
47:50 - before we say goodbye to brett just one
47:52 - thing i want to say today we're joined
47:53 - by some teachers along uh who are
47:56 - basically computer science principals
47:58 - teachers who are graduating this year uh
48:00 - cs principles is the most popular
48:02 - computer science course in america's
48:05 - high schools right now and these
48:06 - teachers have students who are
48:07 - graduating and as you know they've all
48:08 - been basically studying at home for the
48:10 - latter part of the year many of them had
48:12 - to take an ap exam uh as part of that
48:15 - and we wanted to give a special shout
48:16 - out to the students who worked so hard
48:18 - to accomplish their goals in the midst
48:20 - of a global pandemic
48:22 - before we say hi to these folks i want
48:24 - to do an audience poll to ask how many
48:26 - of the students joining us right now are
48:28 - graduating this year
48:30 - and this means whether you're a senior
48:32 - in high school or whether you're you
48:34 - know in elementary school in fifth grade
48:37 - and leaving your school and going to a
48:38 - new school
48:39 - how many of you are graduates or from
48:42 - eighth grade to yeah or ending middle
48:45 - school to go into high school
48:48 - so wow i did not expect to see so many
48:50 - graduating students this year it's
48:52 - pretty awesome to see how many of our
48:53 - students are it's amazing
48:54 - congratulations everyone
48:56 - so we haven't shared the poll results if
48:59 - we could share those yeah about a
49:00 - quarter of all the students on code
49:02 - break are graduating so what a special
49:04 - moment today we congratulate all of you
49:07 - for your graduation and i wanted to
49:08 - invite a teacher uh to join us
49:11 - so is shanti there
49:15 - i'm here
49:17 - hi shanti where are you calling us from
49:19 - i'm calling from ohio cleveland ohio
49:23 - cleveland ohio it's so great to meet you
49:25 - and thank you for all of your hard work
49:26 - helping your students make it through
49:28 - this year uh i know you were hoping to
49:30 - have some of your graduating students
49:32 - join us as
49:33 - panelists but i think it was hard to put
49:34 - together can you read out the names of
49:36 - your students
49:37 - you have some students are actually here
49:39 - though as well um they're they're on as
49:42 - well
49:43 - um
49:44 - so uh mary hudson she's here
49:48 - she just waved uh ashanti hamilton she's
49:51 - under shayla sharp
49:54 - and
49:54 - um so those two are here with us along
49:56 - with some other uh cs students
49:59 - but our other cs graduates are jefferson
50:01 - agitate
50:03 - janaya wheeler rihanna blanchett anaya
50:06 - clark
50:07 - jonathan clay the saint chesney marquita
50:09 - edwards mylena edwards camario malone
50:12 - jalen debose nyla house davion mosley
50:16 - dalita powell samaj stewart tamaya
50:19 - williams and davon
50:22 - thank you so much uh we're gonna unmute
50:25 - everybody uh and to clap for all these
50:27 - students and brett if you don't see all
50:28 - those students you can click this button
50:30 - to to see
50:31 - all the faces
50:33 - [Applause]
50:34 - and shantae you're calling from
50:36 - cleveland ohio is that right
50:38 - yes but um we i teach at shaw high
50:40 - school in east cleveland ohio
50:43 - awesome
50:44 - all right so let's unmute everybody in
50:46 - the audience
50:51 - [Applause]
50:59 - thank you and brett uh you know we give
51:01 - a round of applause for shanti students
51:03 - but if you want to share some words to
51:05 - congratulate not just shanti students
51:07 - but the many hundreds of students who
51:10 - are joining us on code breaker
51:11 - graduating and who aren't getting their
51:13 - own graduation ceremony if you want to
51:14 - share some final words with them well i
51:16 - also say congratulations uh it's such an
51:18 - achievement
51:20 - to graduate and in particular right now
51:22 - in this completely unprecedented time
51:24 - it's so hard to be uh sheltered in place
51:27 - in our homes and and to not get the
51:30 - celebration of some of these graduations
51:32 - but i just want to say
51:33 - so many of the great
51:35 - technologies we've used are created by
51:37 - young people and by students so take all
51:39 - the skills you've learned and take all
51:41 - the creativity you have and the
51:43 - beginners mind you have about um what
51:45 - you want to create and create the future
51:47 - i'm looking forward to seeing all the
51:49 - the cool things you all build with the
51:51 - skills you learned this year
51:53 - thank you so much well thank you so much
51:56 - brett and we're going to say goodbye to
51:57 - brett if you could play an applause
51:59 - sound sofia
52:01 - avaya and it was great to see you and
52:02 - thank you for joining us thank you for
52:04 - having me and uh it was really nice to
52:06 - meet you all
52:08 - right bye-bye
52:09 - and i'd like to now welcome back our
52:12 - third and final guest senior software
52:13 - engineering manager at microsoft powell
52:16 - mejia
52:17 - welcome paola hi heidi thank you so much
52:20 - for having me hi there uh and sofia you
52:23 - can uh head out sophie's gonna say
52:25 - goodbye to us
52:27 - and we're gonna be joined by my
52:29 - son darius hi hey there is how are you
52:34 - darius is 13. paolo where are you
52:36 - calling us from i am calling from
52:38 - seattle washington just like you
52:40 - and you've worked on many tools that
52:42 - many students are familiar with like
52:44 - microsoft office 365
52:46 - or bing and microsoft teams
52:49 - can you share with us a little bit about
52:50 - your back story and what it took to
52:52 - become a software engineer at microsoft
52:54 - yeah yeah absolutely so my journey with
52:56 - microsoft actually started back when i
52:58 - was in college in my senior year i did
53:01 - an internship in the summer of 2006 and
53:04 - then i joined full-time at microsoft in
53:07 - 2007 and over the span of all these
53:09 - years i have worked in office you know
53:12 - which is the family of products like
53:14 - ward and excel and
53:16 - powerpoint
53:17 - um and then i was there for some time i
53:20 - transitioned to bing.com and i was there
53:22 - for about seven years
53:24 - and my last role has been in microsoft
53:27 - teams so i have been there for about
53:28 - three years and that one has been by far
53:31 - you know one of the most exciting
53:32 - products i've worked on
53:34 - i'm not sure you know maybe some of you
53:36 - guys have had the chance to join some
53:38 - online classes or do some video calling
53:41 - using microsoft teams um we're building
53:44 - a collaborative platform you know to
53:46 - facilitate education and collaboration
53:48 - in the workspace
53:50 - but overall it has been a fantastic ride
53:52 - at microsoft i have been there for about
53:54 - 13 years and it's been full of great
53:56 - opportunities to learn
53:58 - new technologies and also to work with a
54:00 - lot of really talented people
54:04 - and you did a lot of internships when
54:06 - you were trying to get get effective
54:09 - into your career can you talk a little
54:10 - bit about that yeah so when i was
54:12 - actually in college i i was trying to
54:15 - apply for an internship at microsoft um
54:18 - i think it took about three attempts to
54:20 - get to the final internship offer
54:24 - during my years
54:26 - in school i was primarily focused on
54:29 - extracurricular projects you know while
54:31 - i was building a strong resume
54:33 - and i was getting more expertise in the
54:36 - technical field one of the things that i
54:39 - did when i was back in school was
54:42 - the imagine cup competition i actually
54:44 - made it to the finals on national stage
54:46 - in mexico and that's where i was born
54:49 - and raised and and where i went to
54:51 - school so um gaining all of that
54:53 - experience since i was uh in school
54:55 - really helped me
54:57 - towards my journey being a software
54:58 - engineer in the tech field and was your
55:01 - internship at microsoft yes yeah i did
55:03 - that internship at microsoft so just two
55:05 - weeks ago we actually met with scott
55:08 - forstall who uh he did his first
55:10 - internship at microsoft as well and he
55:11 - moved on to work at apple and was one of
55:13 - the
55:14 - inventors of the iphone said you can
55:17 - start with an internship at a tech
55:19 - company and move on to create great
55:20 - things so i can't wait to see what you
55:22 - do
55:23 - further on in your career
55:25 - thank you so we want to move on to the
55:26 - last part of our episode which is to
55:28 - learn about circuits because today we're
55:30 - learning about hardware we started
55:32 - learning about input and output in the
55:33 - different
55:34 - aspects of what a computer does and then
55:36 - the parts inside the computer now we
55:38 - want to actually write code to control a
55:40 - circuit this is really different than
55:42 - anything we've done
55:44 - and i'm going to actually share my
55:45 - screen soon to show you but what we're
55:47 - going to do is we're going to write code
55:49 - to code this circuit which is an
55:52 - adafruit circuit playground
55:55 - it uses a architecture called arduino
55:57 - which is a very popular way of basically
56:00 - controlling really small circuits you
56:02 - can purchase one of these it costs about
56:04 - twenty dollars and we're going to send a
56:05 - link to you at the end if you want to
56:07 - and if you look at this thing it has
56:09 - lots of inputs and outputs on it
56:12 - so for example right here there's little
56:14 - buttons you can click
56:16 - uh and around it there are lights
56:19 - but there's lots of other inputs and
56:20 - outputs for example it has an
56:22 - accelerometer that detects if i'm
56:24 - turning it or moving it
56:26 - it even has a temperature sensor inside
56:28 - it and a microphone to hear sound uh do
56:31 - you have uh thoughts on any of those in
56:32 - terms of what those can be useful for
56:35 - yeah so um i mean you can think of
56:37 - circuit boards being present pretty much
56:39 - everywhere in our lives right like if
56:40 - you think about the temperature um like
56:43 - a thermostat for example the ones that
56:44 - we have at home you know it's it's
56:46 - another way of taking information from
56:49 - um an external source and process that
56:52 - and then have an output to tell you
56:54 - something
56:56 - exactly so now we're gonna i'm gonna
56:59 - screen share and this is a slightly
57:00 - different type of screen share for me uh
57:04 - and i'm gonna
57:05 - show us how we do the code to control
57:08 - this circuit
57:09 - so i'm gonna screen share portion of my
57:12 - screen can you all see
57:13 - uh
57:14 - yeah i can see it it's okay and there's
57:17 - two versions of my video now so i'm
57:18 - gonna stop one of them to simplify this
57:20 - so what we see here on the left hand
57:23 - side is
57:24 - app lab which you're comfortable with
57:26 - and here's an app that we're making and
57:27 - all the code for it
57:29 - but i did something here i clicked this
57:31 - gear
57:32 - and i chose to enable the maker toolkit
57:34 - which added a whole new category of
57:37 - commands here see here where it says
57:38 - circuit these are all the blocks that
57:41 - manage
57:42 - things that can happen with this circuit
57:44 - board
57:46 - now over here is the code that controls
57:48 - what our app does and it uses some of
57:50 - these blocks and what we're going to do
57:52 - is we're going to create an app that
57:53 - lets you doodle and draw but using the
57:55 - board as the controller not the mouse
57:57 - a few weeks ago we had the founder of
57:59 - instagram show us how to make an image
58:01 - doodler where you move the mouse around
58:03 - and you draw on the screen and you could
58:05 - choose different colors or you could
58:06 - change the thickness of your drawing but
58:08 - the input device for the drawing was a
58:10 - mouse
58:12 - i want to use this little thing as our
58:14 - input device and the input is going to
58:16 - be by moving it around we're going to
58:19 - draw on the screen
58:20 - and we've already started this code up
58:22 - here it basically has a function here
58:24 - saying onboard event when the
58:26 - accelerometer makes an event
58:29 - and the accelerometer is going to give
58:30 - us a pitch and a roll the pitch is when
58:33 - we move it forward and backwards and the
58:36 - role is when we turn right or left
58:39 - and those those are basically the inputs
58:41 - and outputs of this device and uh you
58:44 - can see here the code that basically
58:45 - text gets the pitch from the
58:47 - accelerometer and it gets the roll from
58:50 - the accelerometer so darius here is
58:52 - going to add some very simple code that
58:54 - allows the pitch and roll of this thing
58:56 - to control the drawing on the screen
58:58 - so we want to use the turtle drawing
59:00 - commands so go into
59:02 - turtle and then say move forward
59:08 - but instead of moving forward 25 pixels
59:10 - move forward pitch pixels so if my pitch
59:13 - is positive and i'm leaning forward
59:15 - it'll move forward that many and if it's
59:17 - negative and moving backwards it'll go
59:19 - backwards
59:20 - and then also now turn right
59:25 - and turn right
59:26 - how what should you turn by how many
59:28 - degrees
59:29 - the roll which is how much we're going
59:30 - left and right so enter the roll there
59:33 - oops you misspelled it
59:36 - all right and just like the examples you
59:38 - were saying about the computers right
59:40 - like when you take an input from
59:41 - something else like the mouse and in
59:43 - this case it's gonna be the movements
59:45 - that you do
59:47 - back and forth and left and right right
59:49 - exactly the inputs are what we get from
59:51 - the accelerometer and the outputs are
59:53 - the move forward and turn right which
59:55 - controls what shows up on the screen so
59:57 - there is can you hit run and i'm going
59:58 - to see if this works
60:01 - all right so i'm leaning forward and it
60:03 - moves forward
60:04 - and then i
60:05 - lean back and it moves backwards
60:08 - and then if i turn right
60:10 - it goes in this crazy circle
60:12 - if and you can change the colors as i'm
60:14 - drawing too if you want oh cool
60:17 - wow
60:18 - and this
60:20 - all right this is going
60:21 - a little bit out of control
60:23 - it's kind of hard to draw with this
60:24 - because it's moving kind of too fast so
60:27 - can you reset it
60:29 - yeah
60:30 - all right so that was going too fast so
60:32 - what could we do to actually make it not
60:34 - move so fast so i can control this more
60:35 - more carefully oh we could do like move
60:38 - forward my pitch divided by
60:40 - like eight all right so you're gonna do
60:42 - some so we'll still go in the direction
60:45 - of the pitch and roll but you're
60:46 - dividing it by
60:47 - some numbers that so it doesn't go quite
60:49 - as aggressively we'll see maybe it's
60:51 - still too fast all right i'm gonna try
60:52 - it again and you can change the colors
60:54 - all right i'm going to lean forward and
60:56 - it's moving forward
60:59 - then i'm going to turn right
61:03 - and i'm going to oh you made it thicker
61:04 - i'm going to turn left
61:07 - that doesn't do anything right now oh
61:10 - so as i'm moving
61:12 - forward i can even move backwards by
61:14 - leaning backwards
61:16 - all right this is kind of fun but one
61:18 - problem with this is basically it's
61:20 - continuously drawing and if i want to
61:21 - stop the drawing i can't lift up the pen
61:24 - and white ink
61:25 - yeah white well white ink you can lift
61:27 - up my face
61:29 - it's an eraser so can you hit reset for
61:31 - a second
61:33 - so there's these buttons on this this
61:35 - left and right button i want to make
61:37 - those macy lift up the pen and put down
61:39 - the pen so we can draw something more
61:40 - complicated and so we can do that using
61:43 - events which we learned about
61:45 - last week so you can even put us into
61:47 - show blocks
61:50 - now if you go into the circuit block
61:52 - area
61:53 - there's an onboard event
61:56 - if you drag that out it enables events
61:59 - so it says onboard if in the event of a
62:01 - button left
62:03 - being down so that's basically
62:06 - that's the left button so when that's
62:08 - down what should we do
62:10 - pen up pen up so i'm going to turtle and
62:14 - say pen up
62:16 - pen up
62:19 - and let's do the opposite for the button
62:21 - right so what can we do there paulo you
62:22 - want to help us as well we can
62:25 - we can say on event
62:26 - [Music]
62:28 - band
62:30 - button r
62:32 - yeah
62:33 - yeah
62:34 - and then from the turtle
62:37 - we could do pen down
62:39 - and you know this circuit also can make
62:41 - sounds so i want to make it so when we
62:43 - press these buttons we actually hear
62:44 - some sounds coming out of this board
62:47 - yeah on the defense
62:49 - so can you go back to the circuit blocks
62:52 - and can you paula help us see if you can
62:54 - see anything that
62:55 - sounds buzzer note i think here let's do
62:58 - buzzer notes yeah
63:00 - um
63:01 - e4 i think a4 means like the abcde notes
63:05 - on a keyboard yeah okay and that 100 is
63:07 - the duration so we can change that to
63:09 - make it longer
63:11 - or like something else if it's 100
63:13 - duration that's gotta be milliseconds
63:19 - can we pick a different sound for the
63:21 - other one
63:22 - here let's do c4
63:24 - yeah
63:25 - four
63:27 - one thousand no we're not ten
63:31 - all right now let's run that and see
63:33 - what happens
63:34 - okay
63:35 - so now
63:37 - if i lean forward it should draw and if
63:39 - i hit the right button the pin is down
63:42 - the left button lifts the pen so now i'm
63:44 - moving around
63:46 - i can turn right and turn left
63:49 - and then right button puts the pen down
63:52 - and
63:53 - makes that little sound and the left
63:55 - button lifts it can you all hear the
63:56 - sound it's making yeah i can hear it
64:01 - right this is not easy to control it's
64:04 - like flying an airplane
64:06 - yeah you can try um i actually want to
64:09 - ask the audience to suggest something
64:11 - for us to draw here oh go ahead you can
64:13 - try um let's do an audience poll for
64:15 - what we can try to draw now with this
64:18 - cool little tool we've got uh
64:20 - there's oops this is on the screen
64:23 - so there's
64:24 - i want to make this easy for me so
64:26 - choose a plus sign please the plus sign
64:29 - is the easiest thing to draw plus sign
64:32 - can can everybody vote for a plus sign
64:34 - because
64:35 - the cat is very popular
64:38 - i think the plus sign is what i want
64:40 - people to vote for
64:42 - yeah i could draw the character
64:45 - it'll it might look like a government
64:47 - all right let's share let's share the
64:48 - poll results
64:50 - okay so
64:52 - it sounds like nobody wants to have me
64:54 - draw a plus sign we'll have to try
64:55 - drawing a cat
64:57 - uh
64:59 - all right so
65:01 - this is not going to be easy at all but
65:03 - i
65:04 - i'm going to try drawing a cat
65:07 - i'm gonna lift up the pen
65:10 - or i'll turn it down and very so you can
65:12 - control the colors if you want so this
65:14 - will be the cat
65:16 - face
65:18 - i'm gonna do the outline of the cat face
65:23 - oh my gosh this is so hard ah
65:27 - this is like an ear
65:30 - it looks like an ear
65:33 - oh no great
65:38 - this is actually better than i thought
65:39 - it would be because i'd practice it a
65:40 - little earlier
65:43 - all right i'm going backwards now it's
65:46 - going in reversal it connects oh
65:51 - not as good as we're going to get on the
65:52 - cat face it's a really nice cat can you
65:54 - help me with the eyes make the eyes a
65:56 - different color
66:00 - all right where should i make the eyes
66:01 - that's one eye no
66:05 - this cat has giant eyes
66:09 - [Music]
66:12 - all right
66:13 - i think this is as good as we're gonna
66:14 - get with the cat you can try making the
66:16 - whiskers if you want
66:17 - so what we oops you hit reset well what
66:20 - we learned there is how to write code
66:23 - that controls inputs and outputs
66:25 - you know when you use commands like move
66:28 - forward or turn right that's putting
66:30 - drawings on the screen and that's
66:32 - controlling the circuits inside your
66:34 - computer that actually put stuff on the
66:36 - screen but whether you're handling a
66:38 - computer or a chip like this the inputs
66:41 - and outputs start as being really simple
66:43 - like little buttons and an event that
66:46 - detects a mouse move is just like an
66:47 - attempt an event that detects a button
66:50 - being down
66:51 - or a command that says move forward or
66:53 - turn right is just like a command that
66:55 - says play the buzzer note in every one
66:58 - of these cases the code you're writing
67:00 - is controlling the inputs and outputs on
67:02 - the screen and when a computer works it
67:04 - receives information through the inputs
67:07 - it runs code to basically manage
67:11 - processing that information and it runs
67:13 - code to basically store that information
67:16 - process it and then uses output whether
67:18 - to show something on the screen to play
67:20 - a sound etc
67:23 - thank you so much for
67:25 - being patient with my terrible airplane
67:27 - drawing skills uh so we shared that app
67:30 - with you but there's a lot more you can
67:31 - do with it
67:32 - and if you want to give us your email
67:34 - address just can you hear me some of
67:36 - those things
67:37 - we want we'll send you instructions for
67:40 - how you can actually make your own using
67:42 - the same board uh so if we don't already
67:45 - have your email address you can go to
67:47 - code.org
67:48 - break code.org break and if you sign up
67:52 - here
67:53 - we'll be able to send you today's
67:56 - challenges for you to try out
67:57 - and there's a bunch of things you can
67:59 - get in these challenges first of all
68:01 - we'll send you the short video series i
68:03 - mentioned about how computers work and
68:05 - that's going to basically be this 40
68:07 - minute long video series that talks
68:09 - about the different parts of a computer
68:11 - and how they actually work at detail and
68:13 - it features bill gates the founder of
68:14 - microsoft explaining the insides of a
68:16 - computer then we'll send you that sprite
68:19 - lab game that sophia and i worked on
68:20 - together and you can add to that project
68:22 - by adding speakers or a camera or more
68:25 - memory and make a more complicated uh
68:28 - computer inside that game and then
68:30 - lastly if you're able to purchase a
68:32 - circuit playground they cost 20 bucks
68:34 - we'll send you a link for one of those
68:36 - then you can use app lab to do much more
68:38 - complicated stuff than the little
68:40 - drawing thing that darius and i just did
68:42 - uh you know you can we'll obviously send
68:44 - you the app that we just made so you can
68:46 - improve on it and play with it the way i
68:47 - just did but we'll also send you ideas
68:49 - for other projects you could do
68:52 - so since this is our very last episode
68:54 - of quote break
68:55 - i wanted to spend some time to give a
68:57 - special thanks to all the parents and
68:59 - teachers who've been joining us and
69:00 - who've made it possible for their
69:01 - children to tune in to code break and
69:04 - participate in their activities
69:06 - first of all if you want to give your
69:08 - own shout out to a parent
69:10 - to your mom and dad please use our
69:12 - question form as i sent earlier about
69:14 - code.org questions and i want to do a
69:16 - quick audience poll how many of the
69:18 - students for joining us today are
69:19 - watching with their parents
69:22 - many of you i know are just watching
69:23 - code break alone
69:26 - but a whole bunch of you are doing here
69:28 - with you with your parents next to you
69:30 - [Music]
69:32 - and we want to do something special to
69:34 - recognize all the parents
69:39 - all right if you could share the poll
69:40 - results
69:41 - so it looks like one third of our
69:43 - audience is actually joining us with the
69:45 - parents
69:46 - paola uh before we go thanking our
69:49 - parents can you share a little bit about
69:50 - your own parents and how they helped you
69:52 - as you were getting into computer
69:53 - science yeah absolutely um so i was born
69:57 - and raised in mexico and i grew up in a
70:00 - city called veracruz which you know
70:01 - where the opportunities to learn
70:03 - computer science were very limited so
70:05 - both of my parents are chemical
70:06 - engineers my mom was actually the first
70:08 - female engineer in the family and they
70:11 - really wanted to support me in a journey
70:14 - where i had all the tools to face a
70:17 - world that's constantly changing so
70:19 - without their support i wouldn't have
70:21 - been able to make it to where i am today
70:24 - um you know but between my parents and
70:26 - also my teachers um they taught me that
70:29 - you know there may be a lot of no's
70:31 - along the way but it only takes one yes
70:33 - to get the the next opportunity and to
70:36 - get on the right track so to the moms
70:38 - and dads joining us today thank you
70:40 - thank you for being there thank you for
70:42 - making a difference i want to thank my
70:44 - parents specifically they have been so
70:46 - inspiring to me and honestly without
70:49 - them i don't think i would have been
70:51 - able to accomplish everything i have
70:53 - that's wonderful one thing that studies
70:55 - have shown is that
70:56 - encouragement from a parent is one of
70:58 - the most important things
71:00 - to keep to basically ensure persistence
71:03 - of young kids in computer science
71:05 - especially among girls or students of
71:06 - color who are typically underrepresented
71:08 - in the field encouragement from their
71:10 - parent is one of the most important ways
71:11 - to get them to stick with it
71:13 - i'd like to invite our producer akira
71:15 - who missed last week's episode to also
71:17 - join me and to read out some of the
71:18 - shout outs to parents from all the
71:19 - students
71:20 - tuning in at home so akira can you join
71:23 - us on screen for a second
71:25 - yes thanks hattie so we have a couple of
71:28 - shout outs to parents um we have one
71:30 - from aniola from the past manitoba in
71:32 - canada and they say i want to thank my
71:34 - mom and dad as they are both essential
71:36 - workers my mom works at a hospital and
71:38 - my dad is a teacher so i think there's
71:40 - accommodation all around on that one
71:43 - dominic says i'd like to give a shout
71:45 - out to my grandma for letting me do code
71:47 - break so i'm really glad that we have
71:49 - grandma's encouragement and finally we
71:51 - have adees and caleb from maddie reading
71:53 - massachusetts and i believe both of them
71:54 - have joined us as former panelists on
71:57 - code break and they said our parents
71:59 - mocta and sent yahoo we want to thank
72:02 - them for working so hard to support us
72:03 - and take care of us not only during this
72:05 - quarantine but for our whole lives
72:07 - they're our main inspiration to learn
72:10 - thank you so much uh and if you could uh
72:12 - just briefly if darris could play an
72:14 - applause sound
72:15 - uh hold on this is coming in right here
72:21 - and i want to basically make a special
72:23 - thanks if we could basically go to
72:24 - gallery mode and basically give a round
72:26 - of applause uh if we could unmute all
72:29 - the students
72:41 - a round of applause to thank all of our
72:44 - students and all of our panelists our
72:47 - parents
72:48 - to to to congratulate the graduating
72:50 - seniors as well as their teachers and
72:52 - lastly a special thanks to our special
72:54 - guests this week alo
72:56 - uh brett and paula
72:58 - i lastly want to say you know this is
73:00 - our very last code break so we're done
73:01 - and we're going to say goodbye to you
73:03 - but if you want to continue learning you
73:05 - can go to code.org
73:08 - at home
73:09 - all the tools and games and things we've
73:10 - learned about are there and there's a
73:12 - whole bunch of other activities we'll be
73:14 - emailing this to you as well
73:16 - and lastly if you want to help support
73:17 - code.org if you want to buy a hat like
73:19 - my cool hat
73:21 - or a t-shirt like the one sophia was
73:22 - wearing you can go to code.org shop or
73:25 - you can just google for code.org on
73:27 - amazon
73:29 - and then lastly all of our work is only
73:31 - made possible thanks to generous
73:32 - charitable donations so if any of the
73:34 - parents want to support code.org if you
73:36 - go to code.org help that's the best way
73:39 - for you to basically help the work that
73:40 - we're doing there's many millions of
73:42 - students who learn computer science and
73:44 - coding on code.org we've had we just
73:46 - passed 50 million students on code.org
73:48 - we want to reach 50 million more
73:50 - students and we only need your help to
73:52 - do that
73:53 - thank you so much everybody who's been
73:55 - with us throughout the last three months
73:57 - of the quarantine uh this is our very
73:59 - last code break so we're just gonna say
74:00 - one big wave goodbye
74:02 - please enjoy your summer breaks and when
74:04 - you're bored and you want some some
74:06 - creativity make sure to take a code
74:08 - break
74:09 - goodbye everybody
74:11 - guys goodbye
74:46 - so
74:50 - [Music]
75:13 - you
