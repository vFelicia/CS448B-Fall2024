00:00 - Unplugged Activity | Relay Programming
00:07 - Hi, I'm Anna! Today we're going to do relay programming.
00:12 - It's all about programming under pressure
and debugging the mistakes that sometimes
00:16 - happen when you work really quickly or in
teams. We'll use graph paper programming to
00:22 - simulate coding, and use relay races to simulate
having a deadline. In relay programming, teams
00:32 - will be racing to finish a graph paper program.
You have to check your teammate's work, or
00:37 - debug it, fix it if there's a mistake, add
your arrow, and run back and tag your teammate.
00:45 - Programmers use debugging a lot to find and
fix problems in their algorithms or code.
00:56 - There are lots of ways to debug problems.
One of the easiest is to move step by step
01:01 - until you find where something goes wrong,
then fix it. Here, I'm trying to do a back
01:08 - handspring, but I keep falling off. I walk
through each part, step by step, and realize
01:15 - where my mistake was. My coach showed me I
wasn't putting my hands on the beam correctly.
01:23 - So I tried another back handspring on the
beam with my new hand position, and I stuck
01:29 - it! I was really glad I debugged my back handspring.
We figured it out!
01:36 - Debugging is finding and fixing problems.
01:42 - Nice, Anna! Good job!
