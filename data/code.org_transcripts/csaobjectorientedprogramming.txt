00:10 - hi i'm gemma bissoni and i'm the ceo of
00:12 - discover labs discover labs is my main
00:15 - professional
00:17 - thing right now and it has been for the
00:18 - last five years and really where that
00:20 - came from was go for the things you're
00:21 - passionate about there are ways that you
00:23 - can be successful i know that i wanted
00:25 - to work in education and accessibility
00:27 - and i also knew that i wanted to work in
00:28 - video games and i didn't want to have to
00:30 - pick between those so
00:31 - you make them happen
00:34 - java is one of the most popular
00:35 - programming languages used today
00:37 - it was first released in 1995 and
00:40 - designed to allow software engineers to
00:41 - write programs that they could easily
00:43 - run anywhere
00:44 - we use apps and programs that were
00:46 - written in java every day like the
00:48 - android operating system and spotify
00:51 - even games like minecraft are written in
00:52 - java
00:53 - scientists also use java programs like
00:56 - the nasa whirlwind system that uses
00:58 - satellites to create a 3d interactive
01:00 - virtual globe
01:01 - java is an object-oriented programming
01:03 - language
01:04 - object-oriented programming is an
01:06 - approach to creating and using models of
01:08 - physical or imagined objects
01:11 - we create models of objects by writing
01:13 - classes a class is a programmer defined
01:15 - blueprint from which objects are created
01:20 - to write a class we first create a new
01:22 - java file
01:23 - we name this file the same name we will
01:25 - use for our class
01:27 - in this case our file will be called
01:29 - myfirstclass.java
01:31 - the name of the file and class should
01:34 - start with an uppercase letter
01:36 - if the name consists of multiple words
01:38 - we use camelcase
01:40 - camelcase is a naming convention in
01:42 - which the first letter of the first word
01:44 - is either uppercase or lowercase and the
01:46 - first letter of each additional word is
01:48 - uppercase
01:49 - in the file we start writing the keyword
01:51 - public
01:52 - then we write the keyword class
01:55 - next we write the name of the class
01:58 - this must be the same name as the file
02:00 - java is case sensitive so the uppercase
02:03 - and lowercase letters must match
02:06 - finally we use curly braces to indicate
02:08 - a block of code
02:09 - each opening curly brace
02:11 - should have a matching closing curly
02:13 - brace
02:14 - we make this class public so it can be
02:16 - accessed throughout the program
02:18 - usually we want our classes to be public
02:21 - this
02:22 - makes up our class header
02:24 - a class header consists of the class
02:26 - keyword and the name of the class
02:29 - congratulations you've just written your
02:31 - first class
02:32 - soon you'll be making classes that can
02:33 - do all kinds of amazing things
