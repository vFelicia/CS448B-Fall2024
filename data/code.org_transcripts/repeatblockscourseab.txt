00:05 - This is a repeat block. The code inside a
repeat block will repeat, or "loop" as many
00:13 - times as you'd like.
00:15 - In puzzles with loops, code that looks like this, works
00:19 - exactly the same as code like this.
00:21 - When you see the same blocks repeated over
00:24 - and over many times in a row, like this,
00:27 - that's a clue that you could make your
00:30 - code shorter by moving the repeated
section into a repeat block.
00:34 - Now let's give it a try!
