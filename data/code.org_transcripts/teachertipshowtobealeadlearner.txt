00:04 - so when i started teaching computer
00:06 - science and i've been a math teacher for
00:08 - almost 10 years so i was very
00:09 - comfortable um in the classroom i was
00:11 - comfortable with students and i was
00:12 - comfortable with my content
00:14 - computer science not so much i took
00:17 - computer science in college but that had
00:19 - been a few years
00:20 - um
00:21 - and learning something and teaching
00:23 - something were two different things
00:25 - um but as i transitioned to the computer
00:27 - science classroom i learned that um just
00:29 - being honest with my students that i am
00:32 - not an expert
00:33 - and that we could all learn it together
00:35 - and it was okay to have questions that
00:37 - that curiosity is something we should
00:39 - embrace and if i didn't know the answer
00:41 - we would find it together whereas a
00:43 - traditional classroom you state the
00:45 - learning targets beginning you do the
00:47 - work it's backwards of a cs classroom
00:50 - and although that's really scary it does
00:52 - take the pressure off because you're
00:54 - allowed to be confused and you can show
00:56 - that as modeling to students like look
00:58 - i'm confused as to how this works
01:00 - so in addition to students having a
01:02 - growth mindset i hope that you as a
01:04 - teacher also have that growth mindset
01:07 - for yourself
01:08 - when you make a mistake
01:11 - don't be afraid to show it and say oh i
01:13 - made a mistake because when your
01:15 - students see that as an example that
01:18 - mistakes are embraced and that you learn
01:20 - from them then they will be encouraged
01:22 - too
01:23 - and you know you need to have grace on
01:25 - yourself as a teacher especially if you
01:28 - don't really have that much experience
01:29 - in computer science
01:31 - and i hope that with this curriculum
01:35 - you guys will be able to do amazing
01:37 - things and you are going to learn with
01:39 - those students i remember my first year
01:42 - when i was teaching computer science for
01:43 - the first time i didn't know
01:46 - anything more than my students did i'd
01:48 - never actually taken a course on
01:49 - computer programming i'd never actually
01:51 - written any code aside from some random
01:53 - puzzles online or something like that
01:56 - and so i was really going along with
01:57 - those students the first year and
01:59 - learning with them
02:00 - and that was something that i just
02:02 - leaned into and it's something i think
02:03 - it's important that you embrace and
02:05 - accept it's not something that you
02:07 - should hide
02:08 - from your students you should let them
02:10 - know that this is a problem-solving
02:12 - experience that you are going through
02:13 - together
02:15 - and you want to go through that together
02:16 - fearlessly
02:18 - being able to lean in with those
02:20 - students and solve problems with them to
02:22 - sit next to them and try to figure out
02:24 - what's going on with their code it can
02:25 - be something really fun and you need to
02:27 - let it be fun and embrace
02:30 - that experience together
02:39 - you
