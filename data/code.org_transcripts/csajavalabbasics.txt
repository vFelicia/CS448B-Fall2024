00:05 - hi my name is jamila and i write
00:08 - curriculum for code.org
00:11 - software engineers use integrated
00:13 - development environments to write their
00:14 - code an integrated development
00:17 - environment is a software application
00:20 - for writing compiling
00:22 - testing and debugging program code
00:26 - we will use java lab as our ide
00:29 - let's take a look at some of its
00:30 - features
00:33 - in the panel on the left we can find
00:35 - instructions and additional tabs that we
00:37 - will visit throughout the year
00:40 - we can also resize
00:42 - and collapse
00:44 - this panel
00:46 - the settings button
00:48 - lets us switch to dark mode
00:51 - or to light mode
00:54 - when we first access java lab the
00:57 - default name of our file is myclass.java
01:02 - we can rename this file by clicking the
01:04 - arrow and choosing rename
01:07 - let's rename our file to myconsole.java
01:14 - if we need to add a new file to our
01:16 - program we can click the new file button
01:20 - then enter the name of the file we want
01:23 - to create
01:25 - if we have multiple files in our program
01:28 - we can click this folder icon to view
01:30 - them all
01:32 - if we need to delete a file we can click
01:34 - the arrow and choose delete
01:38 - the editor is where we can write our
01:40 - code
01:43 - to run our program we just click the run
01:45 - button
01:47 - at the bottom we have our console
01:50 - the console shows us information about
01:52 - our program and any error messages
01:56 - later we'll learn how to print
01:58 - information to the console and use the
02:00 - console to get input from a user
02:03 - we can also clear the console
02:07 - the version history is useful for when
02:10 - we need to go back to a previous version
02:12 - of our program or to start over
02:19 - the finish button marks the level
02:21 - complete and moves us to the next level
02:27 - since java lab can be accessed from any
02:29 - web browser you can write programs
02:31 - anywhere
02:33 - all you need is an internet connection
02:35 - and your creativity
