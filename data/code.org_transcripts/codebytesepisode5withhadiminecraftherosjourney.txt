00:11 - hi everybody and welcome to our final
00:13 - day of computer science education week
00:16 - hi
00:17 - hi this is darius my son and i'm hadi
00:19 - partovi the
00:21 - founder of code.org and the creator of
00:22 - the hour of code
00:24 - this week is computer science education
00:25 - week and all around the world
00:27 - tens of millions of students are getting
00:29 - introduced to coding and computer
00:30 - science
00:32 - and you know the hour of code is
00:33 - something we started about
00:35 - seven years ago in 2013. we were much
00:37 - younger then
00:39 - and you know just in those seven years
00:41 - we've had over 1 billion times
00:44 - has the hour of code been done just this
00:46 - week alone roughly
00:47 - i think about 100 million hours of code
00:49 - have been done just in this past week
00:51 - it's pretty incredible to see an idea
00:53 - that you start in your own
00:55 - bedroom turn into a global phenomenon
00:58 - but here we are
00:59 - and we're excited to close out this week
01:02 - with a lesson
01:03 - on minecraft but before we get into that
01:07 - uh i wanted to first get a sense of
01:09 - where our participants are from
01:11 - so if we could first show up the map
01:14 - that shows where everybody's calling in
01:15 - from that would be great
01:17 - that's amazing all right let's let's
01:21 - stop the screen share and before we get
01:22 - into this lesson one of the questions
01:24 - people have asked is why do we call this
01:27 - code bytes
01:28 - uh does anybody know what a byte is do
01:31 - you know what a byte is
01:32 - yes let's a byte has to do with how
01:35 - computers store
01:36 - numbers do you want to talk about it a
01:38 - little bit don't
01:39 - don't give the answer to how many but
01:41 - what how do computers store numbers
01:44 - well they have numbers stored in bits
01:47 - well
01:47 - actually they have to use binary and
01:49 - what are the bits
01:51 - well bits are like the smallest bits of
01:54 - information and
01:56 - there's a certain number of bits in a
01:57 - byte but
01:59 - i'm not allowed to say that yeah so bits
02:02 - are ones and zeros
02:04 - and so the binary number system lets
02:05 - computers store any form of information
02:07 - using ones and zeroes
02:09 - and a byte is a group of bits and can we
02:11 - put up a poll to see if the audience
02:13 - knows how many bits there are in a byte
02:20 - and if you're answering if you're
02:22 - watching on youtube uh
02:24 - you you won't see this poll as the
02:25 - students are answering
02:27 - so the question is how many bits are
02:28 - there in a byte four bits
02:30 - eight bits 32 bits or 64 bits
02:36 - all right let's end the poll and share
02:38 - the results so
02:39 - about one third of you got the answer
02:41 - right one
02:42 - byte means eight bits of information
02:45 - eight different ones and zeros
02:47 - and with eight bits of information eight
02:49 - ones and zeros you can
02:51 - store any number from zero to 255 using
02:54 - the binary number system
02:55 - there's a whole lot more you can learn
02:57 - about how bits and bytes
02:59 - store information not just numbers but
03:01 - colors shapes
03:02 - images sound and video on computers
03:05 - what's interesting also about the binary
03:07 - number system is it predates computers
03:10 - binary numbers and ones and zeros being
03:12 - used
03:13 - is from really long ago let me show you
03:16 - an example
03:17 - this guy that i'm sharing my screen his
03:19 - name is gottfried leibniz
03:22 - he wrote the math paper that basically
03:24 - described the binary system in 1679.
03:27 - uh yeah why does that one have like yeah
03:30 - i don't know why he has really weird
03:32 - eyes there i don't think those are his
03:33 - real eyes but either way
03:35 - this guy in 1679 so that's about you
03:38 - know
03:39 - 350 years ago he but he didn't invent
03:42 - binary numbers
03:43 - it turns out that binary numbers were
03:45 - being used in egypt
03:47 - 4 000 years ago and in fact the
03:50 - egyptians used hieroglyphics to describe
03:52 - the binary number system so
03:54 - long time before computers were invented
03:56 - people were talking about how to use
03:57 - ones and zeros to represent information
04:00 - anyway that's our fun trivia for the day
04:02 - what we're gonna do today
04:03 - uh for the next about 20 minutes is
04:06 - we're going to dive deep
04:07 - into minecraft coding using the code.org
04:11 - hour of code tutorials
04:12 - and what i'm going to do is show
04:14 - something that i suspect many of you
04:15 - have never seen before
04:17 - we've done you know the minecraft
04:18 - tutorial on code.org is one of the most
04:20 - popular
04:21 - uh activities we've ever created almost
04:24 - 100 million people have tried this 100
04:26 - million students mainly
04:28 - and you know we've made four different
04:30 - uh activities
04:32 - but this one here the minecraft designer
04:34 - this is the one that darius
04:36 - is going to learn to use and and i don't
04:37 - think you've ever tried this before so
04:39 - this is going to be kind of fun for you
04:41 - no i haven't yep so we're going to get
04:43 - started into this
04:45 - and we're going to try a few different
04:47 - levels in this and then we're going to
04:48 - build
04:49 - our own game so so here's the first
04:53 - level we're going to look at
04:54 - and what we want to do is get the sheep
04:57 - to move
04:58 - and usually you're used to code where
05:00 - you get to get you know
05:01 - one character to move forward turn left
05:04 - turn right
05:04 - move forward repeat right now we're
05:07 - going to write the code for
05:08 - all of the sheep sorry all the chickens
05:12 - in with one set of code so if you look
05:15 - here
05:16 - it says chicken when spawned
05:19 - and we've talked about events before the
05:21 - event that happens is when the chicken
05:23 - gets spawned what should they do
05:26 - and the code we put here all the
05:28 - chickens will do
05:29 - so can you write the code that says when
05:31 - spawned move forward
05:35 - and now hit run yay
05:38 - so all the chicken move forward okay hit
05:40 - reset
05:42 - now drag a forever do block
05:45 - and so what this is gonna do is when the
05:47 - chicken and then put that inside there
05:49 - when they're spawned the chicken will
05:51 - all move forward forever
05:53 - all right they got the end of the screen
05:56 - all right
05:56 - now the problem is now we want the
05:58 - chicken to
06:00 - chickens to go in all sorts of different
06:01 - directions so
06:03 - if we want them to move all around let's
06:05 - put up a pole
06:06 - what direction should the should the
06:08 - sheep turn after they move forward
06:10 - you could put up the pole please
06:14 - so the question is should the sheep turn
06:16 - left should they turn
06:17 - right should they turn up should they
06:20 - turn down or should they go in a random
06:21 - direction
06:22 - oh that was too easy of a question we
06:25 - can end this poll because almost
06:26 - everybody got it right
06:27 - if we want the sheep to just wander
06:29 - around they should turn
06:31 - a random direction after every step
06:34 - forward
06:35 - well maybe you should put it before so
06:38 - that they all start out going in random
06:40 - directions
06:41 - sure you can put a that's a good idea
06:43 - good
06:44 - good job all right so now you can hit
06:46 - run
06:47 - and now they are moving in random
06:50 - directions
06:51 - and you can stop this you can also have
06:53 - them uh
06:54 - wait you can have them wait after they
06:56 - move
06:58 - and they'll wait a random amount and you
06:59 - can have them play a sound even if you
07:01 - wanted
07:02 - so now they're just behaving totally
07:05 - randomly
07:06 - and look we just wrote four lines of
07:08 - code those same four lines apply to
07:11 - all the chickens all the chickens are
07:14 - doing the same thing
07:15 - and yet you know with four lines of code
07:18 - that are the same
07:20 - they do different behaviors now let's go
07:22 - to the next level
07:24 - what we want to do here is make the
07:25 - sheep drop wool
07:27 - when you control them and now notice
07:30 - that if you hit
07:31 - run you can use the arrow keys to move
07:34 - up
07:35 - and down and left and right
07:38 - and you can go all the way to the sheep
07:40 - and you can hit the space bar
07:43 - try to get something from him and this
07:46 - isn't really a hard coding level
07:48 - this just says get the sheep to drop the
07:50 - wool when you get to it
07:52 - so and it's not when you touch the sheep
07:54 - or when you reach the sheep it's when
07:56 - you
07:56 - use the sheep using the sheep means
07:58 - hitting the space bar when you're at it
08:00 - so what do you want to do when you get
08:01 - there probably do it
08:04 - drop wool button correct and you want to
08:07 - have a sheet play a sound also
08:10 - sheep bear
08:13 - do you want to play a different sound
08:15 - okay let me see
08:17 - [Music]
08:22 - i wouldn't explode that sounds like a
08:24 - sheep sound that's a sheep sound
08:26 - all right yeah so notice the code for
08:28 - moving the player
08:29 - isn't here we're just writing the code
08:31 - for the sheep
08:32 - the code for the player is you know when
08:34 - you hit the up button move up when down
08:36 - move down and so on
08:38 - but that's already built in and now we
08:40 - can use the cursor keys do you want to
08:41 - use the keys to move him to the sheep
08:44 - okay and i hit the space bar
08:47 - [Music]
08:48 - and the sheep didn't actually explode
08:50 - you sheared him but it played
08:52 - explode sound that was a really easy
08:54 - level
08:55 - now we're going to get to something
08:57 - slightly more complicated
09:00 - so now check this out we want to get to
09:02 - the sheep
09:03 - but we're blocked by a wall and we need
09:06 - to get this guy
09:07 - which is a creeper to explode the wall
09:11 - and it already has code if you look here
09:13 - that says when you touch the creeper
09:15 - this is the creepers code
09:16 - we're modding the creeper we're modding
09:18 - our own minecraft to say what the
09:20 - creeper is going to do and it says
09:21 - when you touch it it will flash flash
09:24 - wait
09:24 - and then it's going to explode but we
09:27 - want it to explode
09:28 - over here so we need the creeper to get
09:32 - to the wall
09:33 - how do we get the creeper to the wall
09:34 - can we put up the next pole please
09:37 - so to get the creeper to the wall we can
09:40 - use a move command it can move forward
09:42 - it can move backwards but look at this
09:45 - block we have here move a step
09:47 - towards and we can have it go towards
09:49 - whatever we want
09:51 - we can have it come towards the player
09:54 - and then we can
09:55 - basically have it guided by moving the
09:57 - player to the wall
09:59 - all right end the poll please so
10:02 - there's a tie and the actual answer is
10:05 - you could do it both ways
10:06 - you could have the creeper move to the
10:08 - player and then we bring the player to
10:10 - the wall
10:10 - or we can have it go to the sheep so
10:12 - darius what do you want to do you can
10:13 - choose
10:14 - i think you should move towards the
10:16 - player because that's more realistic
10:18 - that should be a forever you know so
10:20 - when the creeper as soon as it's spawned
10:22 - it's gonna forever move
10:24 - towards the player i don't got him
10:28 - and then when when it's touched it's
10:29 - gonna basically explode
10:31 - so good luck because you're going to
10:32 - have trouble staying alive the play is
10:34 - sound
10:36 - yeah when it's touched you're going to
10:36 - play his sound and you want to play an
10:38 - explode sound also yes
10:39 - oh thoroughly set to creeper
10:43 - all right you ready okay
10:47 - good luck controlling this because he's
10:49 - gonna try to destroy you
10:50 - [Music]
10:56 - oh no come this way all right no
11:00 - so that's kind of hard do you want to
11:01 - try it the other way
11:03 - yeah that might actually be easier
11:06 - so have a move towards the sheep not the
11:09 - zombie
11:12 - whoops
11:14 - [Music]
11:15 - so now he's just gonna go towards the
11:16 - sheep he's not gonna attack you
11:19 - and now you can touch him and then run
11:22 - away run away run away
11:25 - go farther right now you can get to the
11:29 - sheet
11:30 - we're getting all the doughnuts yeah
11:35 - isn't that pretty cool so i'm gonna stop
11:37 - our share for a second what's kind of
11:38 - different about what we've been
11:39 - doing right now is we're not coding the
11:42 - player
11:43 - the code for the player anybody who's
11:45 - used at
11:46 - even basic coding knows is relatively
11:48 - simple the player code is
11:50 - when the up key is pressed move up when
11:52 - the down key is pressed
11:53 - move down when the left key is pressed
11:56 - move left when the right key is pressed
11:57 - move right
11:58 - and when the space key is pressed it's
12:01 - whatever we want it to do
12:02 - because we write the code for that so
12:05 - what we're doing is writing the code for
12:08 - all the other
12:09 - creatures in minecraft and we can write
12:11 - all sorts of rules for them
12:13 - and uh we're gonna do one more level and
12:15 - then we're gonna make our
12:16 - own thing that we can do whatever we
12:18 - want
12:20 - so get ready isn't this cool you haven't
12:23 - seen this before right yeah
12:25 - i knew you'd like it all right so in
12:27 - this level
12:28 - we still are told what we need to do if
12:30 - you see the player is in the middle of
12:31 - this house
12:32 - and he wants to get out but there's
12:33 - creepers outside blocking all the doors
12:36 - but there's this guy over here i don't
12:38 - know if can you tell what that is it's
12:39 - an iron golem
12:40 - it's an iron golem i don't know what
12:42 - that was but thank you
12:44 - uh so what we need is to get this guy to
12:46 - destroy
12:47 - all the zombies so how do we get him to
12:49 - attack the zombies
12:51 - well first you'll need to go towards the
12:54 - zombies forever
12:56 - so when he is spawned he's gonna forever
12:58 - take a step towards the zombies
13:00 - all right and then what should he do
13:04 - one touch does that mean one touched by
13:06 - a zombie or one touched by a block
13:08 - it means when he's touched by anything
13:10 - it's
13:11 - basically if he touches anything yeah
13:13 - you could play you can attack
13:15 - when he's one used
13:19 - when used means when you when when we
13:22 - press the space bar and that's fine if
13:24 - you say if he gets attacked back he can
13:25 - attack
13:26 - he can attack anything that happens to
13:28 - him sure
13:30 - i'll play sound that would break i don't
13:33 - got one
13:35 - you can change the different sounds if
13:37 - you want
13:39 - iron golem hit
13:40 - [Music]
13:43 - and you wanna do you wanna have a flash
13:45 - when he's touched or something
13:50 - wow we could have him explode when he's
13:51 - touched yeah you can also have him drop
13:53 - dirt you can do anything you want
13:56 - whenever he gets attacked he'll drop a
13:59 - diamond
14:00 - all right i know ayanna
14:03 - oh yeah cause he's an iron column all
14:06 - right
14:10 - it doesn't look like he's getting
14:11 - attacked it looks like he's attacking
14:14 - them
14:15 - oh he killed one of them but yeah
14:18 - so he's he's going through and killing
14:20 - the other
14:21 - creepers there's zombies sorry killing
14:24 - the zombies
14:25 - sorry i don't know the names of these
14:28 - things
14:30 - so basically what he's doing is forever
14:32 - going towards the zombies
14:34 - and when he touches one of them he's
14:36 - attacking and these zombies i guess are
14:38 - not very aggressive so they weren't
14:40 - attacking him back so all of your code
14:42 - here wasn't running
14:44 - all right so we've now done all of these
14:47 - levels
14:48 - and by the way if anybody wants to try
14:49 - these you go to code.org minecraft
14:52 - and choose minecraft designer and what i
14:54 - want to do is now do the
14:56 - most complex of these which is the last
14:59 - level
15:00 - where we get a giant area
15:04 - we got a huge playing field you know
15:06 - that we can control
15:08 - and we get to make our own game
15:11 - and i want to have the audience decide
15:13 - what game we create
15:14 - so put up a poll we have three choices
15:17 - and again if you're watching this on
15:18 - youtube you aren't on the zoom call
15:21 - but we can save the cheap sheep from the
15:23 - chickens
15:25 - we can play zombies versus creepers
15:28 - we can play tag uret alright
15:31 - it sounds like everybody has a
15:33 - preference uh i had prepared us to play
15:35 - save the sheep from the chickens i was
15:37 - all ready for the chickens to attack the
15:39 - sheep and our job is to
15:42 - just say them but okay let's do zombies
15:44 - versus creepers
15:45 - so we get to decide so hold on let me
15:48 - move some of this stuff around
15:49 - there's there's all this code here but
15:51 - we don't need
15:52 - sheeps and cows on this level i mean we
15:55 - can put some on there
15:56 - but the main code we need is the zombies
16:00 - and the creepers because we're going to
16:02 - have zombies versus creepers
16:05 - so do you want them attacking each other
16:07 - do you want one of them running away
16:08 - from each other i think it's better
16:10 - if like one of them is just moving
16:12 - randomly and then the other one is
16:13 - really bad
16:15 - okay the creeper will just be moving
16:16 - randomly because creepers
16:18 - look kind of random yeah
16:21 - all right so have the creepers when
16:24 - they're spawned
16:25 - do the thing we did with sheep so
16:27 - forever they can
16:29 - turn random wait around
16:34 - wait a bit where is that color you have
16:37 - to scroll down
16:38 - okay wait random they can wait random
16:41 - and then they can move forward
16:44 - all right now one one thing we do when
16:48 - coding is debugging regularly so what
16:49 - happens if we run can we test this
16:52 - or is there any three percent off
16:54 - there's no creepers
16:56 - all right how do we get creepers on
16:58 - there there aren't any
17:00 - trust me okay so hit reset
17:04 - can you figure out how to put creepers
17:07 - the question is when should you put
17:09 - creepers
17:11 - when you run yeah when you hit the run
17:14 - button
17:15 - so when we hit the run button we get
17:17 - yeah we can put whatever we want on the
17:19 - board
17:20 - so you know we could put sheep up there
17:22 - if you put that in the forever do loop
17:24 - there'll be
17:24 - there'll be lots of them no let's not do
17:27 - it let's just put some creepers
17:28 - and you're gonna put them left
17:31 - put put one in the left side and let me
17:34 - show you something you could do
17:35 - you can choose another creeper
17:39 - and put that on the up but click on that
17:42 - block and if you hit ctrl c
17:44 - or command c and then ctrl v or command
17:47 - v you can make a copy of that block like
17:49 - i just did
17:50 - so you can do many of these one in the
17:51 - middle command c command v
17:54 - you can put one on the right hand side
17:56 - of the board
17:58 - that's cool command c command v you can
18:01 - put one
18:02 - on the bottom of the of the of the down
18:05 - you can put on the download on the down
18:07 - of the board
18:08 - yeah thanks for correcting my english so
18:11 - now if you hit run
18:13 - you'll see lots of creepers everywhere
18:16 - and they're going to be moving in random
18:17 - directions
18:19 - they don't do anything yet yeah
18:23 - but you can make them say make move
18:26 - sounds if you want or creeper sounds if
18:28 - you want
18:31 - all right the creepers are just
18:32 - aimlessly walking around
18:34 - what do you want the zombies to do you
18:36 - haven't spawned any zombies but
18:38 - do you want to spawn them first okay
18:41 - when they're spawned
18:42 - they will attack the creepers because
18:44 - that's the point of this code
18:50 - they'll move towards the creepers
18:54 - and then when they get touched what
18:56 - should they do i guess when when they
18:57 - reach a creeper they should attack it
18:59 - right
19:05 - and that's basically when when they
19:07 - touch anything or when they get touched
19:08 - they're to attack
19:09 - when used um is there a zombie hurt
19:13 - sound
19:15 - yeah you can look
19:19 - so when used means when you come to them
19:22 - zombie growl zombie
19:24 - hurts zombie moan so you can have it
19:26 - that when you use them which means
19:28 - playing the space bar so the zombies are
19:32 - gonna play sounds the entire time
19:35 - no that's not right
19:42 - there's gonna be continuous growling if
19:44 - you do it that way
19:45 - but that's okay um it may be better to
19:47 - have them growl when they're attacking
19:50 - maybe if i have a weight short time
19:54 - so they aren't too fast yeah they make
19:56 - it make it very make it very short then
19:58 - so they can
19:59 - you want to make this a little bit
20:00 - aggressive okay
20:02 - um all right what attack
20:06 - they should also play a zombie her sound
20:12 - so we're running out of time so don't
20:14 - don't worry too much about the sounds
20:15 - what should the should
20:16 - or actually should the creepers make a
20:18 - sound when they get attacked
20:20 - it should probably blow up if they get
20:21 - attacked yes so what should happen
20:25 - so when a creeper gets attacked
20:29 - you can have it i'll just have it
20:30 - disappear
20:33 - well then how is he gonna fight the
20:34 - zombies
20:36 - well okay
20:41 - by the way when they're attacked they
20:42 - automatically die gradually too you
20:44 - don't need to do anything to make them
20:45 - disappear if you want you could just
20:46 - have them play a sound and
20:48 - and that code happens automatically i
20:50 - don't think you need to make them
20:51 - disappear
20:53 - you can just have them flash then
20:56 - explode i guess
20:57 - no don't if the creepers explode it's
20:59 - gonna okay you could do it we'll do
21:00 - whatever you want i don't care
21:03 - all right you want to try this or have
21:05 - you forgotten anything
21:07 - um what's the one night when davina
21:12 - no you've oh you just spawned a zombie
21:14 - you have to spawn the zombies
21:16 - well that moved forward your code is a
21:19 - little bit of a mess but
21:20 - now spawn the zombies
21:25 - maybe we should only do two zombies
21:26 - because they're gonna be the ones that
21:28 - attack
21:31 - now your zombies might uh
21:34 - explode when the creepers explode also
21:37 - but all right let's try this and see
21:39 - what happens i don't know how this is
21:40 - gonna work
21:43 - so where are the zombies oh yeah you're
21:45 - right that's very loud
21:48 - what's happening
21:54 - there's zombies somewhere there's a
21:56 - zombie it's fighting a creeper
21:59 - wait how did the fire start and see when
22:01 - they exploded
22:02 - the zombies have both been exploded by
22:04 - the creeper because they kept attacking
22:06 - yay creepers won the creeper is one so
22:09 - do you want to change it so
22:10 - if the creepers don't explode the
22:12 - zombies can do more so let me show you
22:14 - some stuff you could do if you take
22:15 - out the creepers exploding and i know
22:18 - creepers explode don't they
22:19 - that's like the rules of minecraft but
22:21 - we're modding it so we can do whatever
22:22 - we want
22:23 - and so we're going to when the zombies
22:27 - uh i'm gonna take out their sound also
22:30 - so they
22:31 - i'm gonna make them fast so they're
22:32 - gonna move fast towards the creeper
22:37 - i'm gonna take out some of this stuff to
22:39 - make it easier
22:41 - so i made it so there's no exploding
22:45 - and i also want to say it's that when a
22:48 - zombie is attacked or actually when a
22:50 - zombie is
22:51 - used when you come to the zombie you can
22:54 - disappear it
22:55 - so you can fight against the zombies
22:56 - because the creepers don't have any
22:58 - defense so when you attack a zombie
23:01 - it'll just disappear but it'll spawn a
23:04 - new one
23:05 - okay so now we'll get a new zombie
23:08 - that'll show up in the middle of the
23:09 - screen so now your job
23:12 - check it out this creepers forever just
23:15 - moving a random direction they're not
23:16 - doing anything
23:17 - and i'm going to make it so that when
23:19 - they're attacked they'll they'll play
23:20 - like a creeper sound
23:22 - uh they'll hit
23:25 - but otherwise the creepers are moving
23:26 - around helpless but there's two zombies
23:29 - attacking six creepers and you need to
23:32 - save the creepers from the zombies you
23:34 - ready
23:34 - set okay go where are the zombies
23:44 - oh i don't know oh that one's not very
23:48 - smart
23:51 - oh
23:57 - no zombies did the zombie wins
24:05 - all right you got the zombies and now
24:07 - it's nice there's new zombies
24:08 - you're not going to brew nathan
24:21 - all right so this game will keep going
24:22 - because you can never run out of zombies
24:24 - every time you get one a new one spawns
24:27 - so it's a game that goes forever
24:28 - and you know one thing we could have
24:30 - done is that when you get a zombie you
24:32 - can add to your score
24:33 - and you can say every time you get a
24:34 - zombie you get 10 points
24:36 - but what was cool is we just made our
24:39 - own game there's no minecraft rules
24:41 - where the
24:42 - where the creepers don't do stuff and
24:44 - the zombies are the ones attacking them
24:46 - thanks to this minecraft designer we
24:48 - basically decided what the creepers are
24:49 - gonna do
24:50 - what the zombies are gonna do you could
24:51 - have done this to make something a lot
24:53 - more complex you could have the sheep
24:54 - running around
24:56 - you know chasing chickens you could have
24:57 - the chickens attacking the cows
25:00 - you could have zombies that move uh so
25:03 - if any of you out there enjoyed watching
25:05 - that go to code.org
25:07 - minecraft and look at the minecraft
25:10 - designer
25:11 - and try it yourself and see what kind of
25:12 - game you could do and again
25:14 - thank you so much for joining us at this
25:16 - is the last day of computer science
25:18 - education week
25:19 - if you joined late later today we're
25:21 - going to have a different version of the
25:23 - code.org minecraft exploration
25:25 - uh that is going to be run by by one of
