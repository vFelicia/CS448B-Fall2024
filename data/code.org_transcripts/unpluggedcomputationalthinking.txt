00:04 - This lesson is computational thinking.
00:08 - Sometimes learning a new game can be tough,
right?
00:12 - At first it might seem really confusing and
sometimes, there's no one there to teach you
00:16 - the rules, so you have to figure it out on
your own.
00:19 - The good news is that you can get better at
figuring things out on your own when you know
00:23 - a few thinking tricks.
00:25 - These tricks are unique ways for looking at
and solving problems.
00:30 - In this lesson, you'll learn about four tricks
and practice them with your friends to figure
00:35 - out the rules to a game.
00:36 - When you break down a big problem into smaller
pieces, you're using your brain to decompose
00:44 - the big problem.
00:46 - Once we've decomposed the big problem into
several smaller problems, we can go on to
00:52 - our next trick, which is called pattern match.
00:56 - That's when we look for similarities between
things.
00:59 - Once I find the things that are the same,
I can figure out what things are different.
01:06 - When I remove those differences, that's called
abstraction.
01:10 - After I have figured out the steps to solving
a problem, I can put those steps in a specific
01:16 - order called an algorithm so that anyone can
use my directions to solve that problem.
01:21 - We're going to use these four steps to figure
out how to play the game with no rules.
01:26 - By the end of the game, you'll be able to
play something that looks like this!
