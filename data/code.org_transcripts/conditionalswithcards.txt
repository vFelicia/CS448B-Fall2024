00:00 - this activity can be a little bit
00:02 - confusing so i'm going to
00:04 - make a little animation to help you
00:06 - through
00:07 - here's how this game is played
00:09 - there are two teams team one and team
00:11 - two each team will draw a card during
00:14 - the round and see according to the
00:17 - conditionals how many points that either
00:18 - they get or they will be awarding to the
00:20 - other team
00:22 - first it's team one's turn for round one
00:25 - they draw a three of spades
00:28 - if you come up to the conditionals
00:29 - you'll see where it says if card is
00:32 - lower
00:33 - than five
00:34 - and this card is lower than five so
00:36 - we're going to go into that if statement
00:40 - and now there are two more statements
00:41 - inside there
00:43 - so we need to look at the top one if
00:45 - card is black
00:47 - it is black which means we go into that
00:49 - if statement and we award your team
00:52 - which is team one the same number of
00:54 - points on the card that gives them three
00:57 - points
00:58 - once we have found a condition that
01:00 - satisfies our situation we get to ignore
01:03 - everything else so we don't worry about
01:06 - any other rules
01:08 - now it's team two's turn
01:10 - they draw a seven of hearts
01:12 - so we go up to the grid and we look and
01:15 - we see if card is lower than five well
01:18 - this card is not lower than five which
01:20 - means we ignore this entire section
01:24 - that means that we need to go into this
01:26 - else statement at the bottom
01:29 - now inside the else statement is another
01:31 - conditional and it says if cart is
01:33 - hearts
01:34 - and it is that means we go in and we
01:36 - award your team which is team two one
01:40 - point so at the end of the round team
01:43 - one has three points and team two has
01:45 - one
01:47 - for round two
01:49 - team one draws a four of hearts we come
01:52 - back to the conditionals if card is less
01:55 - than five and it is which means we go
01:57 - into the if statement
02:00 - if card is black it's not so we're going
02:03 - to ignore that if statement it does not
02:05 - matter to us because our card is not
02:07 - black
02:08 - so we go to the else statement inside
02:11 - that if statement and it says award
02:14 - other team one point which means for
02:17 - this round
02:18 - team one doesn't get anything and they
02:20 - have already contributed one point to
02:23 - team two
02:25 - now team two
02:26 - draws their card and they get a four of
02:29 - clubs
02:30 - so the card is lower than five and just
02:33 - like team one's first pick it is also
02:36 - black which means they award their team
02:38 - team two the same number of points on
02:41 - the card which is four
02:43 - now they already had two points we're
02:46 - going to add the four giving them six
02:48 - points for round two
02:51 - now
02:52 - we draw for round three team one draws a
02:56 - nine of clubs
02:58 - nine is not lower than five so we ignore
03:00 - that entire section up top
03:03 - come down to the else and it says if
03:04 - card is hearts award your team one point
03:08 - it's not hearts which means there is no
03:10 - condition satisfying this card which
03:13 - means there are no points awarded for
03:16 - this round that leaves team one with a
03:20 - score of three at the end of the game
03:23 - it's now team two's turn they draw a
03:26 - five of diamonds
03:28 - now if the card is lower than five well
03:31 - five is not lower than five so we ignore
03:34 - that entire top statement and we come
03:37 - down to the bottom else
03:39 - it says if card is hearts
03:41 - and this is not hearts it's red but it's
03:44 - not hard so we ignore that statement as
03:46 - well which also means there are no
03:49 - statements that match our card which
03:51 - means there are no more points awarded
03:54 - this round
03:55 - that leaves us with the six points we
03:58 - already had
03:59 - and team two wins the game six to three
