00:00 - Hello! My name is Charita Carter. I
am a senior creative producer here at
00:04 - Walt Disney Imagineering. I am
responsible for leading teams that
00:08 - actually produce the attractions that
our guests get to experience, so we are
00:13 - always looking for ways that we can
improve and make a better experience for
00:17 - our guests, and technology is at the
heart of that. Now that you've learned
00:21 - the basics of programming, we're going to
go back in time to build your own game,
00:25 - Starring R2D2 and C3PO. To make a game we, need to learn about something that game
00:32 - programmers use every day. They're called events. Events tell your program to
00:37 - listen, or wait for when something
happens, and then when it does, it
00:42 - performs an action. Some examples of
events are listening for a mouse click,
00:46 - an arrow button, or a tap on the screen.
Here, we're going to make R2D2
00:52 - move up to deliver a message to a rebel
pilot, and then move down to the other
00:56 - rebel pilot. We'll use events to make him
move when the player uses the up/down
01:02 - arrow keys, or the up/down buttons. We use the when up event block, and attach the go up block
01:08 - to it. When the player presses
the up arrow key, the code attached to
01:13 - the when up block is run. And we'll do the
same thing to make R2D2 move down.
01:19 - Instead of writing all the code to
control our droid in advance, we can let
01:24 - R2D2 react to button press events that
move him around the screen, step by step.
01:30 - Your game is getting more interactive!
