00:00 - during make lessons students get the
00:02 - opportunity to write code based on
00:04 - concepts from the explore investigate
00:07 - and practice lessons
00:09 - they're given an app with a completed
00:11 - user interface but usually have little
00:13 - to no starter code
00:15 - they'll need to use all of the skills
00:16 - they've developed in the previous
00:18 - lessons to write the code that will
00:20 - bring the app to life
00:23 - to prepare or make lessons try to create
00:25 - the app yourself and anticipate
00:27 - different approaches different students
00:28 - might take
00:30 - also review the activity guide provided
00:33 - for the make lesson it's a handy tool
00:35 - for helping all of your students or for
00:37 - helping anyone needing additional
00:39 - detailed directions
00:41 - for the make lessons specifically your
00:44 - role is to facilitate a classroom
00:45 - culture around collaboration by
00:47 - encouraging students to utilize one
00:49 - another as thought partners when they're
00:51 - creating their apps in class all right
00:53 - it's looking like most you have your
00:54 - activity guides filled out so we are
00:56 - about to start programming but i want to
00:58 - encourage some collaboration here
01:00 - especially if you're getting stuck
01:02 - the people sitting to your left and
01:03 - right are your best resource and it is
01:05 - totally okay to think out loud or try to
01:07 - help each other think through the
01:08 - challenges you're having
01:10 - all right let's start programming
01:13 - occasionally you may make the decision
01:15 - to bring the whole class together to
01:16 - talk through key misconceptions as a
01:19 - group or even think out loud about how
01:21 - to approach programming this app
01:24 - students who finish early have the
01:26 - opportunity to add functionality to
01:27 - their app beyond what was initially
01:29 - presented
01:30 - or help their teammates in class ask why
01:33 - don't i get you to help some of the
01:34 - people here at this table and you to
01:35 - help some of the people at that table
01:37 - don't write the code for them but help
01:39 - them think through some of the
01:39 - challenges you all ran into okay you
01:41 - knew that yeah awesome thank you
01:44 - it is likely that how you run the make
01:45 - lessons will vary throughout the year
01:48 - you may consider providing more whole
01:49 - room support earlier in the year and
01:51 - then as the year progresses students
01:53 - will feel more comfortable and you can
01:55 - move towards more independent completion
01:58 - of the make tasks
02:00 - oh yeah
02:02 - yeah that's looking really good nice job
02:04 - all right here's what i want you to do
02:06 - on the back there are some extension
02:08 - ideas so you can work on those and if
02:10 - you get through those i'm sure you have
02:11 - even more ideas for how to make this app
02:13 - even cooler let's work on that cool
02:15 - great
02:16 - make tests are designed to take roughly
02:18 - one class period if some students are
02:21 - still uncomfortable with a concept
02:22 - they'll be seeing it again in later eipm
02:25 - sequences oh right these lessons focus
02:28 - on developing students ability to take
02:29 - on the blank screen and design a program
02:32 - from scratch
02:33 - they'll have a chance to summatively and
02:35 - creatively demonstrate knowledge in the
02:38 - end of unit project
02:45 - [Music]
02:52 - you
