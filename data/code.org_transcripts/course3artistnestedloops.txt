00:00 - when you put a loop inside of another
00:02 - loop we call that a nested loop for
00:05 - example here we're given the code all
00:07 - ready to draw one triangle with sides of
00:10 - length 100 pixels
00:12 - using the repeat times block set to 3
00:16 - once for each side of a triangle
00:19 - but we want to draw six triangles
00:22 - in order to do that we're going to take
00:24 - that loop and place it inside another
00:26 - repeat times block
00:30 - pretty cool
