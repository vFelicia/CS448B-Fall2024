00:01 - I think ethics becomes more important 
as something becomes more impactful,
00:05 - and as AI becomes more impactful, the more 
that we have to think about the ethics of AI.
00:18 - Artificial intelligence is ultimately built 
by human beings. Human beings can have very
00:24 - diverse motives for why they make something. 
Unfortunately, there's a huge difference between
00:31 - those that are involved in creating these systems, 
and those that are impacted by these systems.
00:37 - So what we really want to think about long 
term, is where is the society we want to get to,
00:41 - and how is technology going to help enable that?
00:45 - If we think about that in the long term, 
we have a better chance of getting there,
00:50 - than if we just try to develop the 
technology and then see what happens.
00:56 - I have always been extremely inspired by 
the opportunity that robotics presents,
01:01 - to enable us to do work that 
was too dangerous for humans,
01:04 - not possible for humans, or is 
done more effectively by a machine.
01:11 - There have been millions of jobs that have really 
transformed because of the introduction of robots
01:16 - or AI, and that will continue to be the case. 
As a result of that, when we design algorithms
01:23 - that are meant to replace people, we need 
to be attentive of how we do that and how
01:29 - we design those systems, so that it respects 
those people and treats them with dignity.
01:35 - When we think about artificial intelligence, we 
always put people first - we always think about
01:40 - who is that worker who's trying to get a 
job done? How can our technology help them?
01:46 - What do we do in the long term? How do we 
retrain them for another job or another career?
01:52 - As human beings, with all of our creativity 
and passion, we're going to continue to learn
01:56 - how to cooperate with artificial intelligence, 
and have new jobs, have new job descriptions.
02:03 - It is really important that technologists have 
this mantra of ensuring that their innovation
02:09 - is ethical, and is beneficial to everyone 
in society. Machine learning requires a lot
02:16 - of true information to be provided to it, 
in order to ultimately deliver a utility.
02:23 - This information might be very sensitive to us. It 
might be health related, it might be financial. It
02:28 - might be very very personal. We need to put checks 
and controls in place like with any technology
02:37 - that it's utilized to benefit us, and that 
it is done with accordance to the law.
02:43 - There's a lot to gain from involving yourself, 
and really understanding the details of how this
02:50 - technology works. Given that it's so impactful, 
given that it is something that will influence
02:57 - your life and the life of everyone that you 
love. AI is really at this kind of early stage,
03:03 - that has this huge potential to do good. If you're 
young right now and you learn this stuff now,
03:09 - you could really end up being at the crest of 
a wave of something that's really important.
