00:14 - hi
00:15 - i'm kathleen kennedy and i'm the
00:16 - producer of star wars the force awakens
00:19 - today you'll be working with one of our
00:21 - stars bb-8
00:24 - bb-8 is a spherical droid
00:26 - everything he does and every movement he
00:28 - makes is controlled by computer software
00:33 - computer science impacts every industry
00:35 - from marketing to healthcare to film
00:38 - in fact hundreds of computer engineers
00:41 - work together to make a film like the
00:43 - force awakens
00:46 - hi i'm rachel rose i'm a senior r d
00:48 - engineer at ilm and i lead the animation
00:51 - and creature development team
00:53 - in the force awakens i'm responsible for
00:55 - helping the artists develop rigs which
00:58 - are the parts of the character that move
01:01 - that allow the character to look very
01:03 - believable in a galaxy far far away
01:06 - in the next hour we're gonna build our
01:08 - own star wars game that will teach you
01:10 - the basic concepts of programming
01:12 - usually programming is all text but
01:14 - we're going to use blocks here so that
01:15 - we can drag and drop to write the
01:17 - programs
01:18 - under the hood you're still creating
01:20 - code
01:21 - after you try the basics with blocks
01:23 - we'll switch you to javascript one of
01:24 - the most popular programming languages
01:26 - on the web
01:28 - to start off we're going to work with
01:30 - rey to program bb8 to walk to collect
01:32 - all of the scrap parts
01:34 - your screen is split into three parts on
01:36 - the left is the star wars game space
01:38 - where code will run the instructions for
01:41 - each level are written below the game
01:42 - space
01:44 - this middle area is the toolbox and each
01:46 - of these blocks is a command that bb-8
01:48 - can understand
01:49 - the white space on the right is called
01:51 - the workspace and this is where we're
01:52 - going to build our program
01:54 - if i drag the move left block to our
01:56 - workspace and press run what happens
01:59 - bb8 moves left one block on the grid
02:02 - and what if i want bb8 to do something
02:04 - after the move left block i can add
02:06 - another block to our program i'm going
02:08 - to choose the move up block and i'll
02:10 - drag it underneath my move left block
02:12 - until the highlight appears and then
02:14 - i'll drop it and the two blocks will
02:15 - snap together
02:17 - when i press run again bb-8 will perform
02:20 - the commands that are stacked from top
02:21 - to bottom on our workspace
02:24 - if you ever want to delete a block just
02:26 - remove it from the stack and drag it
02:27 - back into the toolbox
02:29 - after you've hit run you can always hit
02:31 - the reset button to get bb-8 back to the
02:33 - start
02:34 - now let's get rolling
