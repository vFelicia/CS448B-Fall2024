00:04 - Guiding students through the problem solving 
process is me reminding them of the process
00:11 - over and over, especially in new situations.
Often times students say, "I don't know where to start"
00:16 - or "I don't know what this means". 
Having that problem-solving process
00:21 - reiterated throughout helps them to 
at least say, "Okay, what *do* i know?"
00:27 - and "What is this asking me?" and it helps them 
flesh that out a little bit more.
00:32 - When I go over the problem-solving process with my students, I let them know that sometimes you can go forward in the process,
00:38 - sometimes you can go in reverse in the 
process, and sometimes you can skip different steps.
00:45 - as long as you're using the problem solving 
process to help you figure out what the issue is.
00:51 - I might not know something, and i'm going to 
reach out to my network to find out the answer.
00:56 - The problem solving process is teaching 
students how to do that, and we automatically
01:02 - assume that students are going to know how to help 
themselves, and it's a learned skill. It's not taught into school.
01:09 - So the ability to teach those problem solving processes is teaching kids how to learn, and how to advocate for themselves,
01:18 - and they're not getting that in any other course.
