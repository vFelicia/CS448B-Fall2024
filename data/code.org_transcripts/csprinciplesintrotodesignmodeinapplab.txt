00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - my name is Kaye Brock and I'm a software
00:08 - engineering intern here at code.org and
00:11 - I'm currently studying computer science
00:13 - at the University of waterl anything
00:16 - that we build with technology is to
00:18 - solve a problem for people and so if
00:22 - people don't want to use what you build
00:24 - because it doesn't look good or it's not
00:27 - designed to be able to be easily used
00:30 - then why bother because they're just not
00:31 - going to use it so for me design is
00:34 - always an integral part of every project
00:36 - that I work
00:38 - on the user interface of an app is what
00:41 - we call all the components of an app
00:43 - that a human can interact with laying
00:45 - out and designing what the screen looks
00:47 - like deciding what kinds of things a
00:49 - user can do like click a button enter
00:51 - text swipe to a different screen all of
00:54 - these are aspects of user interface
00:56 - design we've seen you can add elements
00:59 - to your app like buttons text labels and
01:02 - images with JavaScript code but we've
01:04 - also seen that the process of adding
01:06 - elements to the screen positioning
01:08 - styling them is a bit labor intensive
01:11 - and difficult to see without running the
01:13 - program it also fills up your app with
01:15 - code that's not really related to its
01:16 - core functionality fortunately applab
01:20 - has a feature called design mode a
01:22 - design tool that's lets you quickly and
01:24 - easily design your user interface you
01:27 - should know that apps made in applab are
01:29 - actually web Pages whose visual elements
01:31 - are made with HTML and CSS that are
01:34 - controlled by JavaScript HTML stands for
01:37 - hypertext markup language and tells the
01:40 - browser about the main visual components
01:43 - of the web page CSS stands for cascading
01:47 - stylesheets and can control the styling
01:49 - of these elements like their color
01:52 - position and size the HTML and CSS are
01:55 - stored for you behind the scenes by
01:57 - applab so you can focus on the
01:59 - JavaScript code which is really the
02:01 - brains of the app whether you're using
02:04 - commands like button set position or
02:06 - dragging and dropping a button in design
02:08 - mode they're both inserting HTML and CSS
02:11 - into your app under the hood using
02:13 - design mode helps remove a lot of
02:15 - clutter from your coding workspace
02:17 - allowing you to focus your coding
02:19 - efforts on function rather than design
02:21 - let's see more about how design mode
02:24 - works in applab you'll see a switch
02:27 - right above the app that switches the
02:28 - toolbox from code toolbox to the design
02:32 - toolbox we call this switching into
02:34 - design mode in design mode you can drag
02:37 - and drop user interface components onto
02:40 - the screen and position them wherever
02:41 - you like you can also easily resize an
02:44 - element on the screen by clicking and
02:46 - dragging the little handle on the bottom
02:48 - right
02:49 - corner on the right side of the screen
02:52 - you'll see the design workspace where
02:54 - you can see all the properties you can
02:55 - set for the selected element like the
02:58 - text of the button position I and size
03:00 - values color for the background and text
03:03 - the font size and a few others different
03:06 - elements have different properties you
03:07 - can
03:09 - set once you've got an element on the
03:12 - screen you'll need to make sure you can
03:13 - connect it with your code by setting the
03:15 - elements ID when you set an ID in design
03:18 - mode if you flip to code mode and drag
03:21 - an on event block you'll see a pull down
03:23 - list of all the element IDs you created
03:26 - if you made IDs that are descriptive and
03:28 - meaningful it means means it is easy to
03:30 - choose the ID of the element you want
03:32 - and add code to the event handling
03:36 - function there's also a convenient way
03:38 - from design mode to insert an event
03:40 - handler in your code in the design
03:43 - workspace if you click on the events tab
03:45 - you'll see one or more suggestions for
03:47 - typical events for this kind of element
03:50 - you will see a link that says insert and
03:51 - show code if you click it it'll pend an
03:54 - onevent command to your code and set the
03:57 - idea of the element an event type for
03:59 - you
04:00 - whether you're adding an image element
04:02 - to your app or background images for
04:04 - buttons you can enter the URL of the
04:06 - image you want to use if the image is
04:09 - very large you might need to set the
04:11 - width and height numbers so the resize
04:13 - handle fits in the
04:16 - window instead of entering a URL of an
04:19 - image you can also click the choose link
04:21 - next to the text box which lets you
04:23 - upload your own image and sound files
04:25 - from your computer to your app when you
04:28 - upload a file it goes in to a list of
04:30 - assets you've uploaded so
04:33 - far once it's uploaded you can choose
04:36 - that file lastly you should know the
04:39 - screen itself is an element of your app
04:41 - you can set the background color or
04:43 - background image for the screen the
04:45 - screen also has an ID and can respond to
04:47 - events like any other element for
04:50 - example you might want to know when your
04:52 - user clicked on the
04:54 - screen you can also have multiple
04:56 - screens in your app to add a screen you
04:59 - can drag out a screen element or use the
05:01 - pull down menu just above the design
05:09 - area once you add a screen give it a
05:12 - meaningful ID you can use the pull down
05:14 - menu to switch between screens in design
05:17 - mode but how do you write code to
05:19 - control which screen to show you'll see
05:21 - a command in the UI controls code
05:24 - toolbox called set screen set screen
05:27 - will change the app to show the screen
05:29 - specified by the idid you give it when
05:32 - you drag the set screen command out into
05:34 - the workspace its ID field will show a
05:36 - pull down menu of all the screens you've
05:38 - added to your app now you can change the
05:40 - screen in response to some
05:43 - event using design mode and applab is
05:46 - your great way to quickly and easily
05:47 - making nice looking apps you can add
05:50 - elements to your app upload files like
05:52 - images and sounds even add multiple
05:56 - [Music]
05:58 - screens
06:01 - [Music]
