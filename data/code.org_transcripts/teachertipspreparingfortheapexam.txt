00:04 - i really push my ap computer science
00:06 - class to students who have no computer
00:08 - science background and really wouldn't
00:10 - be your standard ap student because it's
00:14 - brand new information it's not like
00:16 - language arts where there's years and
00:18 - years of leading up and you're good at
00:20 - language arts so you're good at math
00:22 - that really doesn't exist in most
00:23 - schools because ap computer science
00:25 - stands alone so that gives students the
00:28 - confidence of hey you have nothing to
00:30 - lose there's no shame if you know you
00:32 - don't do well because you're learning a
00:33 - whole new topic it's a new experience
00:35 - for you
00:37 - it's really essential to have students
00:38 - practice using scratch paper as they go
00:40 - through their exam
00:42 - they're going to be running through some
00:43 - code that could be anywhere from 10 to
00:45 - 20 lines long to something that in
00:46 - theory could be infinite lines long if
00:48 - they have loops in there and the way
00:50 - they've structured the question
00:52 - students
00:53 - try to remember everything all at once
00:56 - and getting them in the habit of relying
00:57 - on the paper to be something to help
00:59 - them remember things what variables have
01:01 - been assigned to what different booleans
01:04 - might be set to and having them make
01:05 - notes of that write it down draw their
01:07 - boxes for the variables and say what
01:09 - values are stored in them
01:11 - getting to the create performance task
01:12 - and the multiple choice exam
01:15 - and for me
01:16 - who
01:17 - has been an ap reader which is scoring
01:19 - the exams
01:20 - i got the opportunity to score the
01:23 - create task before and looking at how
01:27 - the rubric is interpreted by the college
01:29 - board which is exactly as it's laid out
01:33 - going through that with your students
01:34 - and giving them practice from the
01:36 - hackathon all the way up to the task
01:38 - making sure that your students can
01:40 - answer those questions or hit those
01:42 - bullet points that are important for
01:45 - gaining those points on the rubric then
01:47 - they'll be prepared to take the exam and
01:49 - you'll be
01:50 - you'll feel
01:51 - that you have done
01:53 - your students great service by preparing
01:56 - them for the exam the great performance
01:58 - task can feel really overwhelming and
02:01 - it's this looming project for students
02:04 - that makes them feel a little bit
02:05 - nervous
02:06 - and
02:07 - each
02:08 - eipm sequence is giving them one more
02:11 - tool to complete the create performance
02:13 - task so students are understanding
02:16 - functions they're understanding all of
02:18 - these different puzzle pieces leading up
02:21 - and so that's why it's okay if some feel
02:23 - a little bit rushed you may not finish
02:25 - make lessons because they're pretty
02:27 - meaty they can feel a little
02:29 - overwhelming but it's important for
02:30 - students to understand the pace they
02:32 - need to work at and understand that hey
02:35 - i i know how functions work now i can
02:38 - use that for this bigger project i have
02:40 - some experience i got to test it out i
02:42 - got to see where the problems are
02:44 - that way when the performance test comes
02:47 - they are prepared and they understand
02:49 - there's a lot of debugging this is a
02:50 - really long process so trusting the
02:54 - model that it's going to give students
02:56 - at least a bite of all the different
02:58 - things they need to know in order to
03:00 - complete this big performance test
