00:02 - app lab is a tool for quickly
00:03 - prototyping and building your own apps
00:05 - if you've never coded before you're best
00:07 - off starting with cs principles unit 3.
00:09 - it's a course that'll teach you how to
00:11 - code starting at the very beginning if
00:13 - you have tried coding before i'm going
00:14 - to show you how you can use app lab to
00:16 - build your own apps really quickly
00:19 - on the left you have your app in the
00:20 - middle you've got your toolbox and this
00:22 - has all of the different controls you
00:24 - need to build your app and on the right
00:25 - you have your workspace in the toolbox
00:27 - we have eight different sets of commands
00:29 - the first section are ui controls you
00:31 - can use the ui controls to
00:33 - put buttons on the screen to see what
00:35 - text somebody typed into something or to
00:37 - set text on the screen anything that
00:39 - involves showing and displaying
00:41 - any object on the screen is going to be
00:43 - under ui controls and if you ever don't
00:45 - know what something is you can just
00:46 - hover over it and what you'll see is you
00:48 - get a
00:49 - quick little instruction about it
00:51 - but click see examples for more
00:53 - here you'll get sample code things you
00:55 - can try out
00:56 - just to give you a sense of what
00:58 - somebody else might do with this
00:59 - function and you can just copy and paste
01:00 - this code right into your own code in
01:03 - the data section you can save data to a
01:05 - database and get data from a database in
01:07 - control you'll find functions to allow
01:09 - you to
01:10 - use if statements or loop or control the
01:13 - flow of your program the variables will
01:15 - allow you to set variables or read
01:17 - variables
01:18 - it includes strings and
01:20 - lists which will allow you to create
01:22 - lists
01:23 - under canvas you'll find controls to let
01:25 - you put a canvas on the screen and draw
01:26 - different things into it like circles
01:28 - triangles lines
01:30 - turtle is going to let you put a turtle
01:32 - on the screen
01:33 - and the turtle's not actually turtle we
01:35 - just call it turtle it's just a dot
01:37 - and you can use it to draw lines turn
01:40 - draw a different thing
01:42 - if you've ever used artist in our cs
01:44 - fundamentals courses you'll find that
01:46 - the turtle works a lot like the artist
01:48 - math is all of your basic math functions
01:50 - and in the functions tab you can build
01:52 - your very own functions in app lab
01:54 - here's how you add lines of code you can
01:56 - drag blocks out from the toolbox and
01:58 - snap them together and then click run or
02:01 - if you'd prefer you can type the command
02:03 - yourself either way you write your code
02:05 - you can always flip between block mode
02:07 - and text mode in fact you can work in
02:09 - text mode and drag blocks out to insert
02:11 - the text
02:13 - if you want to practice typing code
02:14 - that's awesome if you make an error use
02:16 - the blocks as a way to check the exact
02:18 - right way to enter something
02:20 - if you want to get rid of a line of code
02:22 - just drag it off the screen or just
02:24 - delete the text
02:26 - if you want to copy and paste code you
02:27 - can drag a lasso around the blocks you
02:29 - want to copy and then use the keyboard
02:31 - shortcuts ctrl c to copy and ctrl v to
02:34 - paste
02:36 - when i'm writing code i actually like to
02:37 - start with design mode first design mode
02:39 - lets me set up exactly where i want the
02:41 - buttons and pictures on my screen to be
02:43 - before i go starting writing all the
02:44 - code and to teach us about design mode
02:47 - kaylie is going to show us around
02:49 - in app lab you'll see a switch right
02:51 - above the app that switches the toolbox
02:54 - from code toolbox to the design toolbox
02:57 - we call this switching into design mode
03:00 - in design mode you can drag and drop
03:02 - user interface components onto the
03:04 - screen and position them wherever you
03:06 - like
03:07 - you can also easily resize an element on
03:10 - the screen by clicking and dragging the
03:11 - little handle on the bottom right corner
03:15 - on the right side of the screen you'll
03:16 - see the design workspace
03:18 - where you can see all the properties you
03:20 - can set for the selected element
03:22 - like the text of the button position and
03:24 - size values color for the background and
03:26 - text the font size and a few others
03:30 - different elements have different
03:31 - properties you can set
03:34 - once you've got an element on the screen
03:36 - you'll need to make sure you can connect
03:38 - it with your code by setting the
03:39 - element's id
03:41 - when you set an id in design mode if you
03:43 - flip to code mode and drag an on event
03:46 - block you'll see a pull down list of all
03:48 - the element ids you created
03:51 - if you made ids that are descriptive and
03:52 - meaningful it means it is easy to choose
03:55 - the id of the element you want and add
03:57 - code to the event handling function
04:01 - there's also a convenient way from
04:03 - design mode to insert an event handler
04:05 - in your code
04:06 - in the design workspace if you click on
04:08 - the events tab you'll see one or more
04:10 - suggestions for typical events for this
04:12 - kind of element
04:14 - you will see a link that says insert and
04:16 - show code if you click it it'll append
04:18 - an on event command to your code and set
04:21 - the id of the element and event type for
04:23 - you
04:24 - whether you're adding an image element
04:26 - to your app or background images for
04:28 - buttons you can enter the url of the
04:31 - image you want to use
04:32 - if the image is very large you might
04:34 - need to set the width and height numbers
04:36 - so the resize handle fits
04:39 - in the window
04:41 - instead of entering a url of an image
04:43 - you can also click the choose link next
04:45 - to the text box which lets you upload
04:48 - your own image and sound files from your
04:50 - computer to your app
04:52 - when you upload a file it goes into a
04:54 - list of assets you've uploaded so far
04:58 - once it's uploaded you can choose that
05:00 - file
05:02 - lastly you should know the screen itself
05:04 - is an element of your app you can set
05:06 - the background color or background image
05:08 - for the screen
05:09 - the screen also has an id and can
05:11 - respond to events like any other element
05:14 - for example you might want to know when
05:16 - your user clicked on the screen
05:19 - you can also have multiple screens in
05:21 - your app
05:22 - to add a screen you can drag out a
05:24 - screen element or use the pull down menu
05:26 - just above the design area
05:34 - once you add a screen give it a
05:36 - meaningful id you can use the pull down
05:39 - menu to switch between screens in design
05:41 - mode
05:42 - but how do you write code to control
05:44 - which screen to show
05:45 - you'll see a command in the ui controls
05:48 - code toolbox called set screen
05:50 - set screen will change the app to show
05:52 - the screen specified by the
05:54 - id you give it
05:56 - when you drag the set screen command out
05:58 - into the workspace its id field will
06:00 - show a pull down menu of all the screens
06:02 - you've added to your app
06:04 - now you can change the screen in
06:05 - response to some event
06:07 - so now that you've gone and designed
06:08 - your program and written some code for
06:10 - it i just want to show you a few other
06:11 - features that you can use in app lab one
06:13 - of the features that i always use is the
06:15 - debugger
06:16 - after i've written some code
06:18 - it always helps to be able to figure out
06:19 - why something's not working quite the
06:21 - way you thought it was going to work the
06:22 - debugger in app lab is right at the
06:24 - bottom of the screen
06:25 - you can minimize it when you're not
06:26 - using it or pull it up whenever you're
06:28 - trying to figure out what's going on
06:29 - with your program
06:31 - you can set breakpoints on any point
06:33 - just by clicking on it and you get this
06:34 - little blue highlight that means that
06:36 - the code is going to stop there when i
06:37 - hit run so here i'm going to hit run and
06:40 - when i click on the pig
06:41 - i can see that my breakpoint is now
06:43 - highlighted and down in my debugger i
06:45 - can see that i can hit continue to keep
06:46 - running i can hit step over to step over
06:49 - this line and go on to the next line
06:50 - step out or step in there's also a debug
06:53 - console and in the debug console you can
06:55 - type any command
06:56 - and you can also type any variable name
06:58 - to see the value of that variable at
07:00 - this point in time so right now if i
07:01 - type score i can see that the score in
07:03 - my program right now is 10.
07:06 - that's a great way to tell what's going
07:08 - on and figure out how your program is
07:09 - working
07:11 - another good thing to use for debugging
07:13 - is your version history if you do mess
07:15 - up and you want to go figure out what
07:16 - you did before you can always click on
07:17 - your version history to go back to a
07:20 - previously saved point in your program
07:23 - and when you're done share your program
07:24 - with your friends click the share
07:26 - program to get a unique url that you can
07:28 - send to your phone or to any of your
07:30 - friends and when they use your app using
07:32 - that url all of the data will be shared
07:34 - in one database so let's say you write a
07:37 - survey app to go ask how many of your
07:38 - friends like dogs and cats every single
07:40 - person's vote will be all tallied into
07:42 - one place and you'll be able to see all
07:44 - of their votes in your app and we'd love
07:46 - to see what you made too if you want to
07:47 - share it on twitter or social media and
07:49 - tagco.org we'd love to check out what
07:51 - you're making with app lab thanks
