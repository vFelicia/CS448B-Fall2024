07:39 - the world has some big problems
07:42 - but i'm little what can i do
07:44 - even when problems seem big we can
07:46 - tackle them one step at a time our
07:48 - generation can help make a more
07:50 - prosperous equitable and sustainable
07:52 - world i'm learning to code i'm designing
07:55 - apps that solve local problems
07:57 - i'm programming robots
07:59 - on learning computer science to make
08:01 - change happen
08:02 - because with technology we can build
08:05 - robots to clean the world's oceans we
08:07 - can program drones to detect forest
08:09 - fires quickly we
08:11 - young women with digital skills and
08:13 - tools we can program our mobile apps to
08:15 - streamline farming in poor rural areas
08:18 - we can use gene sequencing to diagnose
08:20 - diseases and create personalized
08:22 - medicine to cure them i'm little but
08:24 - don't look at my size look at my
08:26 - potential i can make change happen i can
08:29 - make change happen i can make change
08:31 - happen i can make change happen
08:43 - welcome everyone to the
08:46 - 2021 computer science education
08:48 - conference cs edcon give yourselves a
08:50 - round of applause
08:56 - feel free to tweet your questions or
08:59 - just comments pictures to atco.org
09:03 - hashtag csedcon
09:05 - my name is pat yarm praddit
09:09 - and
09:11 - you know a lot of things have changed
09:13 - during the last year and a half
09:17 - this particular picture is actually
09:20 - about 10 years old and obviously
09:23 - pre-covered pre-mask wearing so
09:25 - you know i went to the code.org website
09:27 - and i decided to update it
09:33 - uh you know just kidding that's that's
09:35 - not me that's that's the winter soldier
09:37 - but
09:39 - this is me
09:42 - and and yes
09:43 - i've been working out
09:46 - but all jokes aside
09:48 - we have
09:49 - 270 participants here
09:52 - again give yourselves a round of
09:55 - applause just for making it out
09:58 - go ahead and raise your hand if this is
10:01 - the first in-person conference you've
10:03 - had since covey began
10:06 - wow
10:07 - so it's a wonderful uh
10:09 - time to be here it's a wonderful time in
10:11 - computer science education
10:13 - like i said we have 270 participants
10:16 - from 47 states and 10 countries
10:21 - and given the fact that all of us have
10:22 - been
10:23 - zoomed out over the last year and a half
10:26 - i want you to know that this conference
10:28 - is designed around engagement
10:30 - from the regional networking session
10:32 - we're going to have after this plenary
10:33 - session
10:35 - to the reception later on this evening
10:37 - to the happy hour tomorrow and the
10:40 - strategy sessions on friday we've
10:42 - designed this conference to promote
10:44 - valuable interactions
10:46 - so cs edcon was designed to
10:49 - foster unique interactions
10:53 - to focus and energize the computer
10:56 - science
10:57 - education community
11:00 - and to develop to help you develop new
11:03 - tools and strategies to advance equity
11:07 - in your states your regions and your
11:09 - countries
11:10 - so again thank you for attending cs
11:13 - edcon
11:14 - without further ado i'd like to
11:16 - introduce
11:18 - mrs allison yoshimoto tauri
11:21 - she's going to welcome us to los angeles
11:23 - but first
11:24 - a quick bio about miss mrs yoshimoto
11:28 - towery
11:29 - allison is the chief academic officer of
11:31 - los angeles unified school district
11:36 - she oversees birth to adult education
11:40 - most important to allison is leading
11:42 - from an equity lens and rethinking how
11:44 - business as usual
11:46 - is done to meet the needs of those
11:48 - students and communities historically
11:50 - underserved by public education
11:52 - certainly a mission that we can
11:54 - commiserate with in computer science
11:56 - education
11:57 - mrs allison yoshimoto towery thank you
12:00 - thanks so much
12:04 - so welcome to los angeles everybody
12:11 - so for those of you joining virtually i
12:14 - want you to know there are over 200 and
12:16 - almost 300 people here that are dressed
12:18 - from head to toe in professional clothes
12:23 - quite amazing
12:24 - so it's a blessing to be with you today
12:26 - in person i did want to welcome you to
12:28 - sunny los angeles i know many of you got
12:30 - on planes and are traveling for the
12:31 - first time it's wonderful to be here
12:33 - together
12:35 - i wanted to take you on a little journey
12:36 - but first i wanted to say i'm a mother
12:38 - of two boys we have about a half a
12:40 - million los angeles students sitting in
12:42 - classroom right at this very moment
12:45 - as we're breathing here in this room
12:47 - and
12:48 - they're waiting for the opportunity
12:51 - to for us to do exactly what we're here
12:53 - to talk about
12:55 - my father was an auto mechanic in east
12:57 - los angeles
12:58 - and went to l unified schools and when
13:01 - he started as an auto mechanic it only
13:03 - required a wrench
13:05 - but by the time he finished in his
13:06 - lifetime he needed to understand how to
13:08 - use a computer
13:10 - to fix a car
13:13 - so i'm going to start by from the back
13:14 - from the end and talk forward
13:17 - and in the next few minutes want to
13:19 - build a picture for ourselves
13:21 - if we know already that computing is the
13:24 - number one source of income for our
13:25 - students in the united states
13:28 - and if we know already
13:31 - that girls who take an ap computer
13:33 - science class are 10 times more likely
13:37 - to major in computer science
13:40 - and if we know already that our black
13:42 - and latino students who take ap computer
13:44 - science are seven times more likely
13:47 - to major in computer science
13:50 - and if we know already that students
13:52 - love art and music
13:54 - and computer science and they find more
13:56 - joy
13:57 - in those things in school
14:01 - then we want to make sure that all of
14:03 - our students have those opportunities
14:06 - don't we
14:08 - i want to hear that really loud don't we
14:12 - yes we absolutely do so our challenge
14:15 - today
14:16 - and over the course of this conference
14:18 - is to really think about joy equity
14:21 - and how do we provide that engagement
14:24 - equity and that joy equity
14:27 - that our students deserve
14:28 - every day just like a paper and a piece
14:31 - and a pencil
14:32 - access to computer science to coding is
14:34 - what's going to give them access
14:37 - not necessarily
14:39 - all in computer science industry but
14:41 - that creative innovative thought and
14:44 - that design thinking that students get
14:46 - when they're creating
14:48 - coding when they're
14:49 - it's like riding a bike with the wind
14:51 - flowing through your hair
14:53 - where you know you can steer yourself
14:56 - they get that same feeling
14:58 - when they're learning computer science
14:59 - and how to code
15:01 - that's going to create the new best
15:03 - transportation in this country in this
15:05 - world
15:06 - it's going to create the new fashionista
15:08 - because it's that creative thought
15:10 - right it's going to create the new
15:13 - best way to
15:15 - fix somebody who needs heart surgery
15:18 - because we're
15:19 - we're
15:20 - investing in our young people and the
15:22 - way to think about problems in the world
15:24 - and to create solutions
15:27 - so with that i just want to say thank
15:29 - you for investing thank you for putting
15:31 - everything
15:32 - and being all in with us
15:34 - because this is not just about public
15:36 - education
15:38 - it's about how the private sector offers
15:40 - internships to our students
15:42 - it's about how philanthropy makes up the
15:44 - difference
15:45 - between what students some students get
15:47 - at home and what others don't
15:49 - it's about how our nonprofit world like
15:51 - our amazing partnership with code.org
15:53 - give it up for them
15:59 - leans into public education to support
16:02 - our students
16:03 - and our teachers and our next educators
16:06 - because the way we learned computer
16:08 - science 15 years ago
16:11 - is not the way our students are going to
16:13 - need to be learning at 15 years from now
16:16 - so even today as our students are
16:18 - sitting in class
16:19 - we need to be thinking differently as
16:22 - the grown-ups in the room so thank you
16:24 - all welcome to la and thank you for
16:26 - blessing us with your presence today and
16:28 - enjoy your conference
16:30 - thank you again allison thank you
16:31 - [Applause]
16:35 - so let's go over some logistics
16:38 - starting with uh a bitly link that you
16:41 - all actually have access to on your
16:43 - lanyards i don't have a lanyard on me
16:45 - right now but right behind it is a qr
16:47 - code if you use that qr code you can
16:50 - actually connect to our daily digest
16:53 - that daily digest also includes
16:57 - there it is bitly csikon21 that's the
17:00 - bitly link but you can just use a qr
17:02 - code as well
17:04 - in that daily digest you will find
17:08 - a question parking lot and yes so if you
17:10 - have questions you can type those
17:12 - questions into that question parking lot
17:14 - we'll answer them during the plenaries
17:16 - or the breaks
17:18 - we're going to be tweeting at hashtag cs
17:20 - edcon
17:22 - if you need to use the bathroom it's
17:24 - just over to your left over there that's
17:26 - pretty important
17:29 - we've been released from zoom meetings
17:31 - for the next what two two and a half
17:33 - days so let's take the time to engage
17:36 - with one another personally and like i
17:38 - said we've designed this conference
17:39 - around personal interaction
17:42 - additionally cell phone wise please
17:44 - quiet your cell phones during sessions
17:47 - and if you need to connect to the wi-fi
17:49 - in this area the conference area
17:51 - weston meeting and the password is
17:54 - lowercase cs edcon 2021.
17:58 - now the conference team has worked
17:59 - really hard to make this conference a
18:02 - safe in-person experience
18:04 - and everyone who is here has completed a
18:06 - covid vaccination attestation form thank
18:08 - you for that the local policy here
18:10 - requires us to wear mass at all times
18:12 - indoors unless eating and outside it's
18:15 - recommended but voluntary and so we'll
18:17 - be outside later on for the reception
18:21 - you have these table tents on all of
18:24 - your tables
18:26 - including in this room as well as in the
18:28 - session rooms
18:30 - please uh use that qr code to access our
18:35 - uh contact tracing form so that in the
18:38 - in the case where there might be some
18:40 - medical situation we can uh trace
18:43 - contacts
18:45 - additionally you've all been given the
18:46 - opportunity to wear different colored
18:48 - lanyards depending on your
18:50 - um
18:51 - your
18:52 - just to describe your personal space so
18:55 - starting with the pink one
18:57 - to the yellow one and then the blue one
18:59 - the blue one this uh this okay with hugs
19:02 - and handshakes actually it's been
19:04 - surprising a lot of people are actually
19:05 - okay with hugs and handshakes so much
19:07 - that we actually ran out of those
19:10 - purplish lanyards we had to find another
19:12 - batch so if you had to pick a yellow one
19:15 - and you're actually okay with hugs and
19:17 - handshakes you can go ahead and switch
19:19 - that later on we found another batch
19:23 - lastly
19:25 - we have rapid uh
19:27 - antigen testing in the san diego room
19:30 - uh thursday tomorrow from 3 to 5 pm
19:34 - and then friday
19:36 - at uh from
19:38 - 10 to 12 30.
19:42 - lastly
19:43 - uh the entire schedule is available
19:46 - online at cs edcon dot com schedule
19:49 - there you can create an account add your
19:51 - picture
19:53 - figure out what sessions you want to
19:54 - attend
19:56 - additionally
19:57 - because these sessions are so amazing
19:59 - if you can't attend a session during a
20:02 - particular breakout session slot
20:04 - the slide decks will be uploaded
20:06 - probably about 30 minutes to an hour
20:08 - before that session begins
20:13 - so
20:13 - without further ado i want to introduce
20:15 - our next speakers jake baskin the
20:17 - executive director of the computer
20:19 - science teachers association
20:21 - carol fletcher the principal
20:22 - investigator investigator of the esup
20:24 - alliance and dr katie hendrickson the
20:27 - president of the code.org advocacy
20:29 - coalition let's give them a round of
20:31 - applause
20:38 - good afternoon everyone i am dr katie
20:42 - hendrickson and i am so thrilled to be
20:44 - here with you all to launch the 2021
20:47 - state of computer science education
20:49 - report
20:50 - this is the fifth annual report which
20:53 - combines
20:54 - information about policies that have
20:56 - been adopted to support computer science
20:58 - education
20:59 - with implementation data on computer
21:01 - science access and opportunity
21:06 - code.org the csta and esep are the
21:08 - co-authors of the report but the real
21:11 - work comes from everybody here in this
21:13 - room and everybody watching on the live
21:15 - stream
21:16 - we thank our corporate partners our
21:18 - non-profit partners coalition members
21:21 - advocating for computer science
21:24 - the policy makers who are making
21:26 - computer science foundational
21:28 - and all of the teachers and school
21:30 - leaders who are doing this work on the
21:31 - ground
21:34 - so you'll have a copy of this report
21:36 - i'll take you through some of these
21:37 - highlights
21:38 - for the first time
21:40 - finally
21:41 - half of all high schools in the united
21:43 - states offer computer science
21:50 - this is tremendous this is such a
21:52 - milestone
21:53 - that's up from about 35 percent just a
21:55 - few years ago
21:58 - but on the other hand this means that
22:00 - half of all schools still lack access
22:05 - and there are gaps in who has access
22:07 - i live in a rural community in
22:09 - southeastern ohio one of the poorest
22:11 - counties in the state
22:13 - and students there
22:15 - are likely to attend
22:17 - an under-resourced school
22:19 - students who attend urban schools rural
22:21 - schools or schools that serve high
22:23 - populations of economically
22:25 - disadvantaged students are less likely
22:28 - to offer computer science
22:31 - we need to start to accelerate the
22:33 - closing of these gaps
22:36 - and how do we do that
22:38 - well one answer is policy
22:40 - we know from this report that policy
22:43 - does matter it makes a difference
22:46 - states that adopt more computer science
22:48 - education policies see a greater
22:50 - percentage of high schools offering
22:52 - computer science this is where we can
22:54 - really make a difference to ensure that
22:56 - every student has access
23:00 - so i'd be remiss if i didn't mention
23:02 - what these nine policies are they're
23:04 - detailed in the report so you can dig in
23:06 - but we've seen incredible growth over
23:08 - the past year
23:10 - 50 policies
23:12 - have been adopted by 31 states this year
23:17 - 21 of those states continued their
23:19 - funding for computer science teacher
23:21 - professional development
23:23 - 65 million dollars this year were
23:25 - allocated by state legislatures
23:27 - prioritizing this
23:29 - that's more than any year previous
23:33 - and this year we also saw our first
23:35 - comprehensive policy adoption where now
23:38 - students in every single state can apply
23:40 - a computer science course towards their
23:42 - high school graduation requirements
23:44 - every single student
23:46 - three states went even further and now
23:49 - require all students to take a computer
23:52 - science course in high school before
23:53 - graduation
23:55 - this has been such a big year for
23:57 - computer science education policy
24:00 - now i'm going to turn over to jake
24:02 - jay can you tell us about what this
24:04 - means for
24:05 - implementation and enrollment in schools
24:08 - absolutely thanks katie
24:10 - and this katie said
24:11 - while we cross that halfway threshold we
24:13 - still know that almost half of all
24:15 - schools still don't offer a single
24:17 - computer science course
24:19 - and we also now know thanks to more
24:21 - detailed data from states that even in
24:23 - places that do offer a course it doesn't
24:26 - necessarily mean that students are
24:27 - taking it
24:28 - or that that opportunity is distributed
24:30 - equally
24:33 - for the first time i'm really thrilled
24:34 - to share that we can report that 4.7
24:38 - of all high school students enrolled in
24:40 - a foundational computer science course
24:42 - last year
24:43 - that's for all foundational computer
24:45 - science courses not just ap
24:48 - so i want you to take a second and think
24:49 - about what that percentage is for a math
24:51 - class or an english class in your state
24:56 - although this number represents
24:57 - tremendous growth for computer science
25:00 - there's still so many students who are
25:02 - missing out
25:03 - and there are persistently predictable
25:06 - disparities in who's taking these
25:08 - classes
25:11 - we now know that by introducing computer
25:13 - science and elementary grades
25:15 - in environments where all students are
25:17 - learning together
25:18 - we're thrilled to see gender parity and
25:20 - participation in computer science
25:23 - however as we move into middle and high
25:25 - school we see that gender gap widen
25:28 - where there's a a larger gap in
25:30 - participation between males male
25:32 - students and their female and non-binary
25:34 - peers
25:37 - and as we look at english learners
25:39 - students with disabilities or
25:41 - economically disadvantaged students
25:43 - those gaps persist
25:45 - relative to the overall population of
25:47 - those students in the student body
25:50 - to me these data make it incredibly
25:53 - clear that it's not just about access to
25:55 - computer science
25:57 - it's about what's happening every single
25:59 - day inside of classrooms
26:01 - to ensure that students are walking into
26:03 - equitable and inclusive environments
26:06 - and we need to invest deeply in how we
26:08 - support teachers and develop them
26:10 - throughout their careers to ensure that
26:12 - every student is walking into a
26:14 - welcoming and sustaining computer
26:16 - science environment
26:18 - in fact that's why we specifically call
26:20 - out in the standards for cs teachers
26:22 - that teachers be
26:24 - active advocates for equity and
26:26 - inclusion in their classroom
26:28 - and here at csta we're thrilled to
26:30 - support teachers as they work to create
26:33 - an intentional equity focused vision to
26:36 - improve access engagement and
26:38 - achievement for all of their students in
26:40 - cs
26:42 - and while i'm up here and have the stage
26:44 - i just want to take a second to say an
26:46 - enormous thank you to all of the
26:48 - computer science teachers here in the
26:50 - room and who are watching on the live
26:52 - stream for all of the work that you've
26:53 - been doing
27:00 - it's been probably the most challenging
27:03 - two years imaginable for computer
27:05 - science teachers and teachers everywhere
27:07 - and the wins in this report are thanks
27:09 - to the work that you're doing every day
27:10 - in your classroom so thank you
27:13 - and we also know that teachers operate
27:16 - in larger systems
27:17 - so i'd like to turn it over to carol to
27:19 - share a little bit more about what the
27:20 - report tells us about those environments
27:22 - thank you
27:25 - so um
27:26 - we know that uh
27:29 - csta has done an exceptional job of
27:33 - really providing the supports that
27:35 - teachers need to teach equitably and
27:38 - inclusively in their classrooms but we
27:40 - also know that if we want to scale and
27:42 - sustain
27:44 - the the
27:46 - improvements we've seen in access and
27:47 - participation and evidenced in this
27:49 - report
27:50 - we've also got to address the systems
27:54 - that are producing these equities
27:56 - and in the esep alliance we look at we
28:00 - use a framework called the cape
28:01 - framework
28:02 - to really analyze the entire ecosystem
28:05 - of cs education so we're looking at what
28:08 - is the capacity for equitable cs
28:10 - education where does access and equity
28:14 - intersect what is our uh equitable
28:16 - participation look like and then finally
28:19 - are we giving equitable experiences to
28:22 - students
28:23 - in order to do that work at that systems
28:26 - level however
28:27 - we've got to have disaggregated data
28:31 - at the state level as well
28:34 - because we can't measure what we can't
28:37 - see
28:38 - and so i'm really excited to celebrate
28:41 - some improvements we've seen this year
28:44 - in the report
28:45 - we see that we have more than doubled
28:48 - the number of states that are that are
28:50 - sharing disaggregated data around things
28:53 - like students with disabilities
28:56 - students who are economically
28:57 - disadvantaged
28:58 - race gender english language learners
29:01 - this is a fantastic improvement
29:04 - but as you can see with 30 to 35 states
29:06 - we still don't have every state able to
29:09 - share and interrogate this kind of data
29:12 - and so we need to do more so that we can
29:15 - identify our priorities
29:17 - and then set goals and establish
29:19 - interventions for improvement based on
29:21 - that data
29:23 - i want to give you a couple of examples
29:24 - of states that are using policy policies
29:27 - like what katie mentioned in order to do
29:30 - this
29:31 - one example is the state of washington
29:34 - uh washington was able to implement a
29:37 - policy
29:38 - that said they would have to collect
29:41 - this kind of disaggregated data and
29:43 - generate an annual report i was just
29:46 - reading the annual report the other
29:47 - night on their website their first
29:49 - report out
29:50 - so they've used data policy to drive
29:53 - equity
29:54 - another example of this is in the state
29:56 - of indiana just this year
29:59 - where their legislature said every k-12
30:01 - school has to offer computer science and
30:05 - our state has to collect data based on
30:09 - all of these disaggregated factors so
30:12 - that we can see where those gaps are and
30:14 - then make investments to address those
30:17 - gaps
30:18 - great news here is that when we have
30:21 - this kind of disaggregated data at a
30:23 - state level
30:25 - then we can bring it together up at a
30:27 - national level in the report and here's
30:29 - an example
30:30 - when we look across the nation what we
30:33 - see
30:34 - when we look at who's in our high
30:36 - schools
30:37 - and then who's in our cs classes
30:40 - one of our greatest disparities is with
30:43 - our hispanic and latinx students
30:45 - that means we've got work to do
30:49 - so what we're doing in the ecf alliance
30:51 - to support that work we are launching a
30:53 - three-year common metrics project
30:56 - to help states all across the country
30:58 - understand how to build these common
31:01 - metrics for measuring capacity access
31:04 - participation and experience
31:06 - and to contribute to the broader
31:09 - national conversation around how we help
31:12 - everyone
31:13 - across the country address these
31:16 - inequities
31:18 - i'm going to turn it over to katie now
31:20 - to finish up thank you
31:23 - all right well thank you carol it's
31:24 - great to hear about this work that esep
31:26 - is doing to support state teams and data
31:28 - systems it really does matter for this
31:30 - report
31:31 - and for knowing where our gaps are
31:34 - so i know you're all wondering where you
31:35 - can find out more you have the book in
31:37 - front of you but there are so many more
31:39 - resources online so the blue table tents
31:42 - have a qr code you'll also see the qr
31:45 - code on the standees throughout the
31:47 - reception area and it's also of course
31:49 - on the slide behind me
31:51 - and on the back cover of your book you
31:54 - can go to the website to find
31:56 - state-specific handity
31:57 - handouts an accessible pdf
32:00 - and a tableau interactive data
32:03 - visualization where you can see every
32:05 - single school in the country that offers
32:08 - computer science or doesn't you can
32:10 - filter that by state by region by
32:13 - legislative district however you want to
32:15 - be able to see who has access and
32:17 - opportunity
32:18 - so thank you all so much
32:21 - [Applause]
32:29 - i'd now like to introduce code.org's
32:32 - founder and ceo hadi partovi who's going
32:36 - to talk to us about the next decade of
32:38 - computer science education hadi partovi
32:47 - thank you pat it is so great to be here
32:49 - and to see so many faces in person
32:52 - i actually just wanted to start by
32:54 - thanking both my staff at code.org and
32:56 - also the hotel staff
32:58 - for helping organize the first in-person
33:00 - gathering of the cs community since the
33:02 - pandemic closed the amount of work that
33:04 - has gone into making sure things are
33:06 - safe between the rapid testing and and
33:08 - everything thank you all so please give
33:10 - a round of applause to everybody helping
33:17 - uh pat asked me to start my presentation
33:19 - uh with a brief personal a brief version
33:22 - of a personal story that i shared
33:24 - at the cs.com two years ago our first cs
33:27 - edcon
33:28 - i want to apologize for those of you who
33:29 - attended then that this may be a little
33:31 - bit repetitive but i'm going to make it
33:33 - shorter and i hope for the folks who are
33:35 - i'm
33:36 - seeing for the first time that is a
33:37 - meaningful message but i wanted to talk
33:40 - a little bit before i talk about the
33:41 - future of cs about my why
33:43 - uh you know about my personal motivation
33:46 - for what caused me to start code.org
33:47 - because when you know why you're doing
33:49 - something you put more into it
33:53 - my mother was a computer scientist in
33:55 - iran
33:56 - and my father was a physicist a
33:58 - professor and he started a university to
34:00 - teach technology which has now become
34:02 - the mit of the middle east
34:04 - so between a mother who's a computer
34:05 - scientist and a father who's a professor
34:08 - you could say i had
34:09 - computer science education literally in
34:11 - my blood
34:12 - but that's only part of my why
34:15 - i grew up in tehran iran it's a
34:17 - beautiful country with jungles and
34:20 - beaches and mountains and ski resorts
34:23 - and shopping malls
34:24 - and the main capital tehran is quite
34:26 - different than the stereotypes you see
34:28 - in traditional western media
34:31 - when i was six years old my life turned
34:33 - upside down
34:34 - the country broke out into an islamic
34:36 - revolution
34:37 - and all sorts of change happened in my
34:39 - life
34:40 - i was part of a large family all of whom
34:43 - fled the country
34:44 - my father decided that we would stay
34:46 - behind because he wanted to make sure
34:48 - his university stayed stable during a
34:50 - time of upheaval
34:51 - and life got really really different
34:55 - you know i spent most of my early
34:56 - childhood in constant fear living in a
34:59 - police state you know there were i had
35:00 - friends in our family friends or even
35:03 - family members who'd gotten disappeared
35:05 - and whisked away and for who knows what
35:08 - and i learned that it was safest to just
35:09 - not talk to anybody
35:11 - to act like i was you know to pretend
35:14 - like i was a muslim because that's what
35:15 - you had to do there was forced prayer in
35:17 - school and basically i learned that the
35:20 - safest thing was to not be seen
35:22 - and that was how i would survive
35:24 - and then as the police state if that
35:26 - wasn't enough a war broke out with the
35:28 - neighboring country of iraq which
35:30 - invaded and then
35:32 - my my home was right next to the
35:34 - television station of the country so we
35:36 - had bombings every other night so most
35:39 - of my evenings in my childhood were
35:41 - spent in a basement with a kerosene lamp
35:44 - holding my ears just hoping that our
35:46 - home would get spared
35:48 - and my father would wake up in the
35:49 - morning to go up to the rooftop to
35:51 - assess the damage
35:52 - and so this was basically the repeated
35:54 - scenes of what i saw growing up and then
35:56 - things got bad enough eventually that my
35:58 - parents decided uh we weren't gonna stay
36:00 - there and so then we we decided to move
36:03 - to the united states which itself if
36:06 - anybody here is an immigrant knows is
36:07 - not an easy process but it's extra
36:10 - difficult if you're iranian during the
36:12 - 1980s so we when we applied for
36:15 - admission to the united states we were
36:17 - rejected the first time we were rejected
36:19 - the second time we were rejected the
36:22 - third time but then finally we got in on
36:24 - as tourists uh
36:26 - but then i needed to my parents wanted
36:28 - us to stay permanently as students
36:30 - that wasn't possible so i was actually
36:32 - deported and told i need to go back to
36:34 - my home country we got very lucky that a
36:38 - a generous lawyer helped us basically
36:40 - apply a fourth time
36:42 - and uh the fourth time we finally got to
36:44 - stay uh in the country
36:46 - but staying in america as a as a new
36:49 - immigrant family had its own challenges
36:50 - my family was poor
36:52 - uh that we you know we didn't have our
36:54 - own house uh we had to share a bedroom
36:57 - all four of us with mom and dad my
37:00 - brother and i sharing
37:01 - two twin beds that were stuck next to
37:03 - each other uh
37:05 - i i didn't get to buy my own clothes i
37:08 - only wore very loose-fitting
37:09 - hand-me-downs the first car i managed to
37:11 - get with my brother together we scrapped
37:13 - together 500
37:15 - to buy our own car but this was still
37:17 - wonderful because we weren't living in
37:19 - fear and we weren't in a time of war
37:22 - what wasn't so great is the
37:23 - discrimination
37:25 - iranians faced at that time my first
37:27 - nickname in school was sheikh
37:30 - my second nickname was jihad
37:33 - literally calling me a terrorist
37:35 - and i learned again to laugh along at
37:37 - jokes made at my expense and to try not
37:39 - to be different than anybody else
37:41 - but after all this my life has turned
37:43 - out to be amazing i went to the best
37:45 - school and because of my parents
37:47 - investment in education
37:49 - i i attended on financial aid
37:52 - and i worked throughout my summers and
37:53 - and school years to pay tuition i
37:56 - majored in computer science i got my
37:57 - first job in technology and since then
38:00 - doors have been open for me and things
38:02 - have just gotten better and better and
38:04 - better and i'm now living
38:06 - thanks to the amazingness of the
38:09 - opportunity systems in this country and
38:11 - the education i had i'm now a nice
38:13 - embodiment of the american dream
38:15 - but i should say still as an iranian in
38:17 - this country it is not always
38:19 - uh roses you know iranian americans even
38:23 - though my skin is white life in the us
38:25 - doesn't come with all the privileges of
38:26 - being white
38:28 - you know iranian americans and middle
38:29 - easterners in general have sought for
38:31 - decades to be classified by the united
38:33 - states as people of color to recognize
38:35 - the discrimination that we face
38:37 - some people get to be judged the moment
38:39 - somebody sees your face other people are
38:41 - judged when your name shows up on a
38:43 - resume or an email
38:45 - and for me this is still personal
38:47 - within the last year i was called arab
38:49 - trash by somebody
38:51 - and also just in the last seven months
38:53 - the association of computing machinery
38:55 - in our own field of computer science
38:57 - gave its highest award the turing award
39:00 - to a professor who explicitly said that
39:03 - he won't help iranian students
39:06 - now why do i say all this i'm not first
39:09 - of all comfortable saying all this
39:11 - because i'm not asking for pity my story
39:13 - is not a sob story my story is a story
39:15 - of opportunity in the american dream and
39:18 - i wake up every day feeling like i'm the
39:19 - luckiest person in the world
39:21 - but what is relevant is anybody who
39:23 - faces struggles or discrimination of any
39:26 - sort
39:27 - learns about the difficulties that
39:28 - others face and learns empathy for
39:30 - discrimination and learns about how how
39:33 - important it is to give people a pathway
39:36 - and a pathway to opportunity
39:38 - and so when i think about my own story i
39:40 - also think about the story of other
39:42 - students
39:43 - students like spencer applegate growing
39:45 - up in rural kentucky in one of the
39:48 - poorest neighborhoods where almost a
39:50 - third of his fellow students are
39:51 - homeless
39:52 - and he in just a hundred lines of code
39:55 - wrote the the rewrote the game tetris on
39:58 - code.org as an as part of his cs
40:01 - principles class but he's too poor to
40:03 - have the phone that he could play the
40:05 - game on where i think of
40:07 - uh araceli casillas growing up in south
40:10 - seattle as a child of immigrants as the
40:13 - first member of her family to go to
40:14 - university when i see these people's
40:16 - story i see my own story
40:19 - and i share that because each of us has
40:21 - our own story of what brings us into
40:23 - this movement into this idea of helping
40:26 - others survive and helping others thrive
40:29 - my story isn't what we put on the on the
40:31 - main page of code.org because each of us
40:34 - with all of our differences have
40:36 - different reasons why we believe in
40:38 - opportunity for our children but that
40:40 - belief is what brings us together
40:43 - our shared belief that opportunity
40:45 - shouldn't depend on the color of your
40:47 - skin on your gender on your family
40:50 - income on the zip code or the country
40:52 - you grow up in on your religion on your
40:54 - nationality this is what brings us
40:57 - together and this is an idea that unites
40:59 - people across states across countries
41:03 - across political divides it is why our
41:06 - movement has been so strong it is why
41:08 - our movement has had the support of
41:10 - every presidential administration in
41:12 - this country as well as presidential
41:14 - administrations from all uh all
41:16 - political sides across different
41:18 - countries
41:20 - and so the idea that every student in
41:22 - every school should have the opportunity
41:24 - to learn computer science is not just an
41:26 - idea about opportunity it's an idea
41:28 - about unity and about bringing people
41:30 - together
41:33 - now i want to reflect a little bit
41:34 - briefly about the amazing process that
41:36 - we
41:37 - the amazing progress that we had in the
41:39 - last decade because
41:41 - this is 2021 but we kind of skipped 2020
41:44 - and we didn't get a chance to ring in
41:45 - the new decade so this is really our
41:47 - chance to do this
41:49 - i first want to show again the the the
41:51 - picture that katie presented
41:53 - it is amazing that we're now finally at
41:55 - the point that the majority of schools
41:57 - in the united states teach computer
41:59 - science when we started code.org it was
42:01 - around 10 of schools we're now at past
42:05 - the halfway mark of getting to 100 of
42:08 - schools that is amazing work
42:10 - and i want to make sure everybody not
42:12 - only celebrates this work for because
42:14 - it's all your work so quick let's do a
42:16 - round of applause
42:22 - this is the work of all the folks here
42:24 - from the united states working on this
42:25 - and i'd love for you to share the news
42:27 - so if you have your phones
42:29 - please scan this qr code it's a link
42:31 - directly to a tweet
42:33 - about this news
42:34 - if you have your phones just scan the qr
42:36 - code and hit the retweet button we would
42:39 - love to share the news that the majority
42:41 - of u.s schools are now teaching computer
42:43 - science
42:44 - and by the way i'm so happy that
42:46 - everybody now knows how to scan qr codes
42:48 - it's like the new
42:49 - skill that we all learned in the last
42:51 - year and a half
42:55 - there's some other things i just want to
42:57 - share about the progress we've made
42:58 - including the progress we've made just
43:00 - in the last two years
43:03 - two years ago on this stage we announced
43:05 - that there were one million computer
43:07 - science teachers on code.org
43:10 - just two years later there's over 2
43:12 - million computer science teachers on
43:13 - code.org it's doubled in two years time
43:16 - which is phenomenal and it shows the
43:18 - power of technology spreading education
43:21 - and it also shows that even during a
43:23 - pandemic this movement is strong
43:26 - two years ago we also shared that
43:29 - there's 50 million student projects that
43:31 - have been created on code.org
43:34 - if if doubling the number of teachers
43:36 - wasn't enough we're now at 170 million
43:39 - projects created on code.org
43:47 - and again your work is what has made
43:49 - this possible
43:50 - now if you think about the bigger
43:52 - picture beyond code.org we're part of a
43:55 - global movement in education that is now
43:57 - one of the largest and fastest efforts
43:59 - to add a new subject to the global
44:01 - curriculum
44:02 - in the united states all 50 states have
44:05 - passed policies and plans to make
44:07 - computer science a more systemic part of
44:10 - education
44:12 - there's been over 350 million dollars in
44:14 - federal and state funding for this work
44:17 - and over a hundred thousand new computer
44:19 - science teachers have gone through
44:20 - professional learning workshops thanks
44:22 - to all of our partners and the many
44:24 - other organizations working on this
44:25 - problem
44:26 - and globally
44:28 - over 70 countries have now announced
44:30 - plans of some sort for teaching computer
44:32 - science many of them complete national
44:35 - rollouts or requirements for every
44:36 - student to learn
44:38 - and as i mentioned over 2 million
44:39 - teachers alone on code.org alone have
44:41 - begun teaching and the hour of code this
44:44 - simple idea that just started with
44:46 - having every teacher just try one hour
44:48 - of computer science in their classroom
44:50 - has passed over 1.3 billion engagements
44:53 - all of this has been incredible work and
44:56 - so many of the folks in this room are
44:57 - the ones that are responsible for making
44:59 - it happen so thank you for that
45:01 - but we are still so far behind where we
45:04 - could be behind the vision of every
45:06 - student in every school learning
45:08 - computer science
45:09 - when jake shared the numbers in terms of
45:12 - enrollment of students in the united
45:13 - states it's so great to see that we
45:16 - finally have enrollment numbers for the
45:17 - entire country
45:19 - but we are so far from where we could be
45:21 - and we also know that disparities exist
45:24 - disparities in access based on where you
45:26 - live and or your
45:28 - or your income level disparities
45:30 - enrollment especially among young women
45:33 - in ap computer science there's so much
45:35 - we need to do
45:37 - now as we think forward to the ringing
45:38 - in of a new decade
45:40 - computer science is at a major
45:42 - inflection point this is a major
45:44 - inflection point caused by 2020 and the
45:47 - pandemic and the digital divide
45:50 - the last 10 years
45:52 - we had so much success in our movement
45:54 - the next 10 years we are poised for so
45:56 - much more because of the ways the
45:58 - pandemic has changed the importance and
46:00 - need for computer science i want to
46:03 - mention three different ways the
46:04 - pandemic is going to accelerate the work
46:07 - of computer science education in the
46:09 - next three years
46:11 - the first is the proliferation of
46:12 - devices in the united states we are at
46:15 - now at the point where 90 of students
46:18 - have one-on-one devices given to them
46:20 - from the school this is a change that
46:22 - happened because of the pandemic when
46:24 - when everything shifted to distance
46:26 - learning and now we have an opportunity
46:28 - to use those devices for more than
46:30 - zooming into classrooms but for learning
46:33 - how to create technology and this isn't
46:35 - a us-only trend uh i was just speaking
46:38 - to to
46:40 - the the
46:41 - i think it's claudia from el salvador
46:43 - who's saying that they're rolling out
46:44 - computers to every single student in el
46:46 - salvador not every country has the same
46:49 - capability but across all the countries
46:52 - there's been an increase in devices
46:54 - the second pandemic change that is
46:56 - helping our movement is that every
46:58 - teacher
46:59 - has had a crash course in technology
47:02 - whether it's learning zoom or slido or
47:05 - kahoot or whatever it is every teacher
47:08 - had to up their technology game
47:10 - every school had to learn to adapt
47:13 - and after decades of thinking that
47:15 - schools and education can't adapt
47:17 - everybody has learned that when there's
47:19 - a need we can adapt our school systems
47:22 - and so that gives us an opportunity to
47:24 - rethink what education should look like
47:26 - in the future
47:28 - there's a third and still ongoing change
47:30 - from the pandemic which is the economic
47:33 - hurt caused by the closures of every
47:35 - business for almost a year
47:38 - everywhere around the world economies
47:40 - are hurting and we're still seeing that
47:42 - today with the issues with our supply
47:44 - chain it's going to take some time for
47:46 - things to come back
47:47 - so the need for opportunity people's
47:49 - need for having a livelihood for seeing
47:52 - a pathway up is greater now than ever
47:54 - before
47:55 - and during in that situation meanwhile
47:58 - what has changed is the nature of work
48:00 - the number of companies that are willing
48:02 - to hire people with technical skills
48:04 - anywhere in any community in any state
48:07 - and in many cases in any country
48:10 - these are all logos of companies that
48:12 - have said they will hire technologists
48:14 - remotely so you don't need to move to
48:16 - silicon valley if you're growing up in
48:18 - rural kentucky you can get a tech job in
48:21 - rural kentucky
48:23 - in fact if you look at the states that
48:25 - have the most job openings in computing
48:28 - california is the largest state with 70
48:31 - 000 open computing jobs
48:33 - the second largest is remote which means
48:36 - you can work from anywhere you don't
48:38 - need to move to california to work in
48:40 - tech you could work from wherever it is
48:42 - and this is something that is not only a
48:44 - u.s
48:46 - change or trend this is going to be a
48:47 - global trend which means anywhere in the
48:50 - world
48:51 - the the way towards opportunity is more
48:54 - going to be about education work will
48:55 - come to where the talent is
48:58 - and so as we think about ushering a new
49:00 - decade
49:01 - we can establish that computer science
49:03 - is more important now than ever before
49:06 - and this has to be our mindset we need
49:08 - to reignite interest in computer science
49:11 - and we need to help educators think
49:12 - about establishing a new normal with
49:15 - computer science as a basic part of it
49:18 - in the united states we've worked so
49:20 - hard to get ap computer science to grow
49:22 - we need to imagine that in the in the
49:24 - 2020s computer science is going to
49:27 - become an equal of the other top ap
49:29 - subjects right alongside english
49:31 - literature u.s history biology or
49:34 - calculus computer science should be at
49:36 - least equal if not ahead of some of
49:38 - those aps in popularity it's still far
49:41 - from there today because it's not even
49:43 - available in most schools but we are
49:45 - definitely going to catch up with that
49:47 - within the next 10 years
49:49 - the other thing we need to establish is
49:51 - that computer science isn't just about
49:52 - tech jobs it's a foundational part of
49:55 - basic education it's as foundational as
49:58 - reading and writing and arithmetic
50:00 - just like you use what you learn in
50:02 - english class when you go into history
50:04 - class and just like you use the math you
50:07 - learn when you go into physics class
50:10 - we're going to need to establish that
50:11 - computer science isn't just its own
50:14 - standalone course it will need to be
50:16 - integrated into other courses as well
50:19 - and in fact for this year's hour of code
50:21 - our theme is that computer science is
50:23 - everywhere to help show teachers to make
50:26 - connections between computer science and
50:28 - other fields like biology like art like
50:32 - history and so on
50:33 - and code.org is going to be announcing
50:35 - its own curriculum efforts in this space
50:37 - soon we're going to make a multi-year
50:39 - effort and commitment to support
50:41 - teachers who want to bring computer
50:43 - science not just in computer science
50:46 - class but into the other classes and
50:48 - subjects as well and in fact every
50:50 - computer science teacher is going to
50:52 - have an opportunity to help their school
50:54 - integrate computer science into physics
50:57 - into chemistry into social studies into
51:00 - art into literature to help make those
51:02 - connections
51:05 - we also need to establish the computer
51:07 - science is more important is more than
51:10 - just coding you know my hat says code on
51:13 - it so a lot of people assume that
51:14 - computer science and code are the same
51:16 - thing
51:17 - but computer science is about so much
51:19 - more and in fact the non-coding aspects
51:22 - of computer science in this decade are
51:24 - likely to become more important than
51:26 - coding when you think about data science
51:28 - ai machine learning and cyber security
51:31 - those three things together might be
51:33 - more important than coding by the end of
51:36 - the 2020s
51:38 - cyber security requires its own special
51:40 - call out i was recently at the white
51:42 - house to talk with all the top tech
51:44 - leaders the top banking leaders
51:46 - insurance leaders and education leaders
51:48 - in the country about the importance of
51:50 - cyber security to our national defense
51:52 - and this isn't just a us issue it's a
51:54 - global issue
51:56 - we are in a cyber world war right now
51:58 - people don't talk about it because it's
52:00 - invisible but our country and every
52:03 - country is in a state of war when it
52:04 - comes to cyber security and every cs
52:07 - teacher plays a role in our national
52:09 - cyber defense in helping citizens know
52:12 - how to stay stay safe online and how to
52:14 - protect their home computers because as
52:16 - we are all connected a student's
52:19 - computer at home is on the same network
52:21 - as their mom or dad's computer who's
52:23 - then logging in remotely into a
52:25 - workplace and one person making a
52:27 - mistake can cause entire systems to go
52:30 - down
52:32 - my last comment i want to make is that
52:34 - computer science is increasingly about
52:36 - solving global problems
52:38 - and this is one of the most important
52:39 - messages we need to establish
52:42 - when i was studying computer science it
52:44 - was about
52:45 - using coding to solve or to calculate
52:48 - the fibonacci sequence of numbers or
52:50 - using recursion to calculate factorials
52:53 - and many of you who learned computer
52:55 - science over the last 10 or 20 years may
52:57 - have heard
52:58 - learned it that way when mark zuckerberg
53:00 - was starting computer science it was
53:02 - about sharing information on the
53:03 - internet
53:04 - we need to establish that computer
53:06 - science is about curing diseases
53:08 - cleaning oceans addressing global
53:10 - poverty addressing gender equality and
53:13 - addressing climate
53:15 - this we need to change our computer
53:16 - science courses to be about solving
53:19 - global problems and to recognize this
53:21 - movement as a global movement
53:23 - the next generation is inheriting all
53:25 - sorts of issues and problems from the
53:28 - older generation and most of those
53:29 - problems are going to be ones that
53:31 - they're going to be able to solve using
53:33 - technology but only if we democratize
53:36 - access to the learning and the skills
53:38 - for them to do that
53:41 - one last question i want to bring up is
53:43 - this question of should computer science
53:44 - even be a graduation requirement this is
53:47 - a question we are going to face over the
53:49 - next decade it's a question that's
53:51 - already being asked in the united states
53:53 - in multiple states
53:55 - there are three states so far
53:57 - arkansas south carolina and nevada that
53:59 - require every student must learn
54:01 - computer science and in fact because of
54:04 - doing that they are addressing gender
54:06 - disparity and racial disparity and
54:08 - income disparity in who enrolls because
54:10 - every student enrolls when it's a
54:12 - graduation requirement there's many
54:14 - other states already thinking about this
54:17 - and code.org hasn't yet decided to put
54:19 - its weight behind a graduation
54:21 - requirement as a recommendation but we
54:23 - are certainly aware that this is a
54:26 - movement and a push that's already
54:27 - happening and i'm confident that over
54:29 - the next 10 years
54:31 - we're going to shift from sort of wait
54:33 - and see approach and and looking at the
54:35 - research
54:36 - 10 years from now we're going to be in
54:38 - the mode that computer science is
54:39 - something that every school not only
54:40 - should teach but that every student
54:42 - should be studying as a requirement for
54:44 - graduating i'm sure that the conditions
54:47 - are going to change in that direction so
54:49 - you need to start thinking every one of
54:51 - us who's working on this problem should
54:52 - think about
54:53 - what does it take to make computer
54:55 - science a graduation requirement what
54:57 - are the conditions that need to be
54:58 - present in terms of the schools the
55:01 - teaching capacity the universities the
55:03 - funding etc to get us to get a state or
55:06 - even a country to be ready for that
55:08 - change
55:09 - if we think 10 years out we should be
55:12 - able to get every u.s student studying
55:14 - computer science by 2030 by making a
55:17 - requirement for graduation
55:19 - and if you think globally within 20
55:22 - years we should be able to get to every
55:23 - single student in the world by making it
55:26 - a requirement for graduation this is the
55:28 - ultimate holy grail in cs education is
55:30 - making it required for students it's not
55:33 - something we've talked about
55:34 - very much but it is going to be
55:36 - something that over the next decade
55:38 - becomes part of this movement
55:41 - now this movement is a community effort
55:43 - and i'm so thankful for all the
55:44 - organizations that are here with us it's
55:47 - an educator-led movement that started
55:49 - with teachers teachers like juan lonzano
55:52 - in my own neighborhood of south seattle
55:54 - who brought computer science to their
55:55 - own school and from their school spread
55:58 - it to their entire district who helped
56:00 - make
56:01 - policy change happen in all 50 states
56:04 - and we're now at the point that all 70
56:06 - that sorry that 70 different countries
56:08 - have announced plans it is amazing for
56:11 - all of us here to be part of a global
56:12 - movement
56:14 - and when i think about this global
56:15 - movement i want to return things to my
56:17 - own personal story and my why
56:20 - when i came to the united states as an
56:22 - immigrant my family didn't have very
56:24 - much i was learning a new language i was
56:26 - learning a new culture i didn't even
56:28 - have the the right fashion sense to
56:30 - dress correctly for the my first day of
56:32 - school
56:33 - but what i did have is a fantastic
56:35 - ability to code and a pathway in
56:38 - education that helped me succeed way
56:41 - ahead of my peers and way ahead of my
56:43 - dreams
56:45 - and so my story is a story of
56:46 - opportunity but my story is also the
56:48 - same as the story of araceli casillas or
56:51 - spencer applegate or of katie clemens in
56:54 - missouri who in her apcs principles
56:57 - class built an app to help diagnose her
56:59 - friend's mental her classmate's mental
57:02 - health or of these students in
57:04 - johannesburg south africa who are
57:06 - participating in africa code week or
57:08 - this young girl in in rural popayan in
57:11 - colombia and this work is thanks to
57:14 - teachers everywhere like flo von in
57:17 - oakland who are globally bringing more
57:19 - and more students into computer science
57:22 - their story is all a story of
57:24 - opportunity
57:25 - at a time when our world is full of
57:27 - despair
57:28 - this movement brings people hope and
57:30 - opportunity and at a time when the world
57:33 - is increasingly divided this movement
57:36 - brings people unity it is a story of
57:38 - unity
57:39 - and so i want to close by thanking all
57:41 - of you and the over 2 million educators
57:44 - and partners together you're helping
57:46 - changing the face of computer science
57:49 - thank you
57:56 - so we have
57:58 - we have some time for
58:00 - uh a couple questions and we have these
58:02 - two microphones right here so if you'd
58:05 - like to come up and ask a question of
58:06 - hottie this is the opportunity to ask
58:09 - i'll ask a question of hadi ari
58:12 - uh what is the
58:14 - the greatest challenge we face
58:16 - coming out of kovid in terms of uh
58:19 - raising more awareness around computer
58:21 - science
58:23 - that's a great question
58:25 - i think our greatest challenge is the
58:26 - same challenge we've faced
58:28 - for the whole time this movement has
58:30 - been growing which is
58:32 - the challenge of perceptions
58:34 - about whether or not computer science is
58:36 - part of basic education
58:38 - most adults think of education as the
58:41 - school they went through and so when
58:43 - they think about computer science they
58:44 - don't think of adding it at the same
58:47 - level as math or english they think of
58:49 - adding it like as an after school
58:50 - activity or a maker lab or something for
58:53 - the special kids getting adults to think
58:55 - that this is as foundational as reading
58:59 - or writing or math or science and it
59:00 - belongs as a pillar of education that is
59:03 - by far the hardest challenge to change
59:05 - hearts and minds but we are lucky
59:07 - because of the pandemic that there is a
59:08 - new
59:09 - opportunity to rethink things people are
59:11 - more willing to rethink education just
59:14 - like you see people are willing to
59:16 - rethink the workplace that we have an
59:18 - opportunity because of the pandemic to
59:20 - actually break through in terms of this
59:22 - this perception
59:25 - great
59:26 - thank you hottie
59:28 - any other questions come on up come on
59:31 - up to the microphones and you can
59:33 - ask a question of our ceo here
59:38 - and please introduce yourself
59:41 - hey hottie my name is mark barnes i'm a
59:43 - computer science specialist with the
59:44 - state of arkansas
59:46 - i work with
59:47 - the arkansas school for the deaf and the
59:49 - arkansas school for the blind and
59:51 - visually impaired
59:52 - what kind of work is code.org doing
59:54 - right now
59:56 - to help students particularly students
59:58 - with blindness and visual impairment
60:01 - who may not be able to use like a
60:02 - block-based coding environment or some
60:04 - of the other tools that are currently a
60:06 - big part of computer science education
60:09 - that's a really good question
60:11 - you know students with learning
60:12 - disabilities of any sorts are
60:14 - are a different group that is
60:15 - underrepresented in computer science and
60:17 - there's work that needs to be done
60:19 - when it comes to deaf students code.org
60:21 - has done a lot
60:22 - such as putting captions in all of our
60:24 - videos and a number of other activities
60:27 - like that when it comes to
60:28 - vision impaired students code.org's own
60:31 - courses aren't directly supportive
60:33 - enough but we've partnered with a group
60:35 - called access i think access cs out of
60:37 - university of washington working with a
60:39 - tool called quorum to make a a version
60:42 - of our cs principles course designed for
60:44 - visually impaired students
60:46 - and this is a topic that is near and
60:48 - dear to my heart so we haven't we
60:50 - haven't yet announced plans for doing
60:52 - things to to support
60:54 - visually impaired students but as we
60:56 - think of new ides and new ways to teach
60:58 - computer programming you know not only
61:01 - the block based coding is vision based
61:03 - if you look at the actual output of the
61:05 - programs it's usually drawing art or
61:08 - making apps or making websites and one
61:10 - of my personal interests is to see can
61:12 - we shift to you know using python or
61:15 - java to make music or to make chat bots
61:18 - you know voice chat like alexa these are
61:21 - also technological systems that you
61:23 - don't need your eyes to be able to
61:25 - interface with the computer to listen to
61:26 - music or to use voice-based uh computing
61:29 - and i think but those are going to be
61:31 - opportunities we tap into in the next
61:32 - decade
61:34 - thank you
61:38 - good afternoon
61:39 - definitely i'm height deficient sorry
61:42 - um good afternoon my name is fran
61:44 - bromley norwood i am the k-12 computer
61:47 - science administrator for the clark
61:48 - county school district
61:50 - in nevada um and i my question for you
61:54 - is is that when you have the opportunity
61:55 - to go to the white house primarily to
61:57 - talk about cyber security
61:59 - as we're aware unfortunately the
62:01 - internet infrastructure
62:04 - globally specifically in our country in
62:07 - order to make sure that they're getting
62:08 - those opportunities
62:10 - that are the plugged version versus the
62:12 - unplugged version of what code.org
62:14 - offers whereas conversation discussed i
62:17 - know that there have been a lot of input
62:19 - and communication regarding making that
62:21 - happen i was just wondering whether or
62:23 - not you've had an opportunity to
62:25 - demonstrate that code.org would like to
62:27 - support that
62:28 - in order to make sure that students
62:31 - you know countrywide are able to access
62:34 - the amazing programming that's available
62:37 - for them
62:38 - so that those numbers get higher in
62:39 - terms of exposure to computer science
62:42 - well we have advocated for increased
62:44 - connectivity in schools
62:46 - throughout our existence we're lucky in
62:48 - the united states that there's
62:50 - billions of dollars a year being
62:51 - provided by the federal government for
62:53 - school internet connectivity although
62:54 - we're still not at 100 of schools the
62:57 - the picture of connectivity in schools
62:59 - in the us today is far better than eight
63:02 - years ago when code.org started
63:04 - and globally even it is improving but
63:07 - far far behind
63:09 - but i am hopeful that internet
63:11 - connectivity in schools as well as
63:13 - device availability for students those
63:15 - are things that are growing even with or
63:17 - without code.org
63:20 - my main goal is to make sure as we
63:22 - connect up schools and as we give
63:23 - devices to students let's also provide
63:26 - the education for them to not only learn
63:28 - how to use technology but how to create
63:30 - it or how to understand its societal
63:32 - impacts
63:33 - and i believe that's actually the harder
63:35 - challenge because there's lots and lots
63:37 - of people worrying about connecting
63:39 - schools and not enough worrying about
63:41 - computer science education but thank you
63:43 - so much
63:44 - thank you
63:46 - and pat i think we're all set yeah we
63:49 - have uh two more questions hottie okay
63:51 - um
63:54 - hi heidi i'm ann leflich i'm a professor
63:56 - at indiana university and i'm a code um
63:59 - csf facilitator for next tech and also
64:02 - co-pi for the esup grants um my question
64:05 - really comes in as we're talking about
64:06 - elementary and you're talking about all
64:08 - the different areas um
64:10 - where computer science is incorporating
64:12 - ethics and incorporating ai and data
64:14 - science and cyber security what do you
64:16 - see happening to your elementary
64:18 - curriculum and how is that going to be
64:20 - adapted to either include those things
64:21 - or do you see that as
64:23 - something that is going to be included
64:24 - up in the higher grades
64:26 - that's a great question so the code.org
64:28 - cs fundamentals elementary curriculum
64:30 - already includes
64:32 - aspects of digital literacy digital
64:35 - citizenship cyber security we recently
64:37 - added our ai for oceans module into that
64:40 - just to make sure those students learn
64:42 - about machine learning as part of cs
64:43 - fundamentals but the real effort that we
64:46 - need to do is the one that i mentioned
64:48 - earlier which is basically
64:50 - creating
64:52 - learning units for integrating computer
64:53 - science into math into english into art
64:57 - and into the other subjects taught in
64:58 - elementary schools
65:00 - because when you think about computer
65:01 - science in elementary schools
65:03 - code.org has and and scratch both have
65:06 - spread very broadly as kind of a special
65:08 - in education but they're not
65:10 - systemically included in most schools
65:13 - and one of the best ways to be
65:14 - systemically included in elementary
65:16 - education is to also be included as part
65:18 - of math and english and the other
65:20 - subjects that are
65:22 - effectively baked into elementary
65:24 - education and so as we think about
65:26 - shifting from sort of a teacher-led
65:28 - effort to teach coding in k-5 to making
65:31 - it more of a district-led effort part of
65:33 - our work is going to be about creating
65:35 - the curriculum lessons for integration
65:37 - into math integration into english
65:39 - integration into social studies etc and
65:42 - and that's the future of where our
65:44 - elementary curriculum is going
65:48 - thank you crystal franklin c.s for clea
65:50 - out of cleveland state university and of
65:51 - course esep
65:53 - uh you mentioned there are uh three
65:55 - states that currently require cs4
65:57 - graduation
65:58 - do you foresee any danger and i'm going
66:01 - to use danger
66:02 - in the way you think
66:03 - of mandating that where there's resource
66:06 - poor districts and the option to opt out
66:09 - may create actually the reverse effect
66:11 - that's a great question and in fact
66:13 - you're
66:14 - to
66:15 - the the question she asked is is there
66:17 - any danger to mandating computer science
66:19 - for graduation
66:21 - there absolutely is and that is why i
66:23 - said code.org is still in a wait-and-see
66:25 - mode of trying to understand
66:27 - how things go in the states that have
66:29 - done this and getting a better sense of
66:31 - what the conditions on the ground need
66:32 - to be to make it possible uh the dangers
66:35 - of mandating computer science for
66:37 - graduation without thinking about it the
66:39 - the most obvious danger is kids not
66:41 - graduating
66:42 - beca you know the other danger is at
66:45 - schools that don't have the capacity to
66:47 - teach computer science
66:49 - you know what do they do
66:51 - do they not graduate students or what
66:53 - are they cut or so on so
66:56 - but thinking about mandating it for
66:57 - students forces you to address all the
67:00 - other access and representation and
67:02 - funding issues and there's many states
67:04 - who are then looking at that and saying
67:06 - what what can they do about it there's a
67:08 - state
67:09 - that i where i've been
67:10 - talking to some of the leadership of a
67:12 - state where they're talking about first
67:13 - of all reducing some of the other
67:15 - graduation requirements so it doesn't
67:17 - raise the bar on students and about
67:19 - providing funding to every school to
67:21 - teach computer science and also offering
67:23 - an online sort of
67:25 - option for a school that doesn't have a
67:27 - cs teacher at least students can learn
67:29 - it online
67:31 - and certainly anthony owen who's here
67:33 - from arkansas
67:34 - can share if you talk to with him later
67:36 - what are the steps arkansas took
67:38 - getting to cs as a graduation
67:40 - requirement requires all the other work
67:42 - first to get to uh you know if the the
67:46 - the slide that cal showed about the cape
67:47 - framework it requires the capacity and
67:50 - the access and and the then finally this
67:54 - brings in the the participation and the
67:56 - experience for students
67:57 - thank you for the questions very
67:59 - important to keep it in mind
68:04 - howdy thank you so much for uh
68:07 - giving us a vision for the future of
68:09 - computer science
68:15 - just a couple notes per those questions
68:17 - you can visit code.org accessibility if
68:20 - you want to learn about our
68:22 - accessibility uh work
68:25 - including
68:26 - with
68:27 - deaf students and students who are
68:29 - visually impaired
68:30 - and as per the last question that
68:31 - crystal asked about states
68:33 - we actually have a session about that
68:35 - how to make computer science and
68:36 - graduation requirement the right way
68:38 - actually featuring arkansas the national
68:40 - governors association as well as south
68:42 - carolina if you're interested in that
68:44 - visit that session tomorrow right now
68:47 - we have regional networking
68:50 - and so in about 10 minutes
68:53 - you're going to be in these different
68:55 - rooms depending on whether you are in
68:57 - the midwest northeast south or west now
68:59 - you might be wondering well actually
69:01 - what what what is my state is it is it
69:03 - midwest or is it is it south well if you
69:06 - visit csedcon.com
69:09 - schedule
69:10 - you'll find a listing of the states
69:13 - per those different regions so those are
69:15 - those rooms those rooms you'll actually
69:17 - find right outside
69:20 - this door to the california ballroom
69:22 - and down the stairs
69:24 - and then around the corner those that's
69:25 - where all the regional networking rooms
69:27 - are as well as all of our sessions
69:30 - go ahead you are dismissed
69:39 - you
