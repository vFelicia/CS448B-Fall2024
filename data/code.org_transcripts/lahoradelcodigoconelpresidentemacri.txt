00:27 - You can learn more about technology because as the years pass,
00:33 - the whole city, the whole country is going to be automated.
00:37 - In school we do many activities, programs on Arduino boards,
00:40 - we use different programs like PSeInt, Python, Scratch, Sublime,
00:45 - all of the ones like that are for programming.
00:47 - Very happy, proud, to be here in the Casa Rosada presenting a new video from Code.org
00:52 - to encourage that young people, in addition to using technology, learn to create it.
00:57 - Microsoft the the primary supporter of this organization
01:00 - and what we are looking for above all is for students to learn computer science
01:05 - and that the curriculum is changed in all of the countries in Latin America.
01:09 - Argentina is the first country in South America, and in all of the Americas,
01:14 - that is going to change the curriculum to teach computer science, programming, and robotics
01:24 - to all students in all grades.
01:27 - It is a very important change.
01:30 - We had an experience with the president.
01:32 - We taught him how to use Code, which is a page where you can create games, applications, or web pages
01:39 - like we are using in school.
01:40 - And it was quite educational.
01:41 - We showed him the different functions or options that we had to program different things,
01:48 - what corresponds with each function,
01:51 - and it was quite educational.
01:52 - We got a lot out of it. The experience helped me a lot.
01:56 - When I finish school, I would like to have a telephone company
