00:03 - okay everyone
00:05 - hotties gonna go ahead and join and then
00:08 - I'm going to introduce some and we're
00:09 - going to give them a big round of
00:10 - applause oh did you
00:23 - you
01:06 - you
01:08 - ok everyone welcome to the tech chat
01:11 - with hottie part Obi it's our last day
01:15 - of computer science education week so
01:17 - really excited to have him here and all
01:19 - of you to answer his your questions so
01:22 - why don't we go ahead and give them a
01:23 - big round of applause sure I just wanted
01:56 - to say it's a welcome thank you for that
01:59 - round of applause and it's just been an
02:00 - amazing week you know around the entire
02:03 - country and around the entire world
02:05 - classrooms we're doing the hour of code
02:07 - and it's it's amazing to see how this
02:09 - movement that just started literally two
02:11 - years ago has gotten to the point of
02:14 - complete worldwide spread you know in
02:16 - the United States one out of every three
02:18 - schools is participating in the hour of
02:20 - code but beyond the United States
02:22 - there's entire countries who are doing
02:24 - it in Italy and in Russia every single
02:27 - school is doing the hour of code and
02:28 - then in places like Nigeria or Syria
02:31 - Iraq Afghanistan places where there's
02:34 - Wars going on
02:35 - people are doing the hour of code
02:37 - there's Islands you know in the Indian
02:39 - Ocean there's a small island called
02:40 - Cocos Island where every single
02:42 - inhabitant every person on the island is
02:45 - doing the hour of code it's unbelievable
02:46 - to have started something two and a half
02:48 - years ago that has picked up so much in
02:50 - terms of worldwide spread and it
02:52 - everybody believes that learning the
02:55 - basics of computer science is something
02:56 - all of our students need some access to
02:58 - it's so fun to be doing this thank you
03:00 - so much for joining me
03:05 - okay so thanks howdy we're going to go
03:08 - to our first school Emerson Elementary
03:11 - and Texas versus great questions the
03:25 - question is how much has coating changed
03:27 - today versus a few years ago you know if
03:30 - you'll be two years ago three years ago
03:32 - it hasn't changed very much but if you
03:34 - go back ten or twenty years it's changed
03:36 - a whole lot those of you who are doing
03:38 - the drag-and-drop sort of dragging the
03:41 - commands whether it's on tablets or on
03:43 - computers where you're not actually
03:44 - typing the drag-and-drop method of
03:47 - coding has only been around a little bit
03:49 - more than ten years and that makes it so
03:52 - much easier to learn you know before
03:54 - that anybody who have to code needed to
03:56 - jump strut straight in in two times and
03:59 - it's not that the typing is hard but
04:01 - it's it's much easier to make mistakes
04:04 - because if you spell something just a
04:05 - little bit wrong the computer doesn't
04:08 - recognize it whereas when you're
04:09 - dragging and dropping it's easier and
04:10 - before you had to you had a chance to
04:13 - type you know 30 40 years ago computers
04:16 - didn't even have keyboards the only
04:18 - thing they had was little readers that
04:21 - you had put a piece of cardboard into
04:23 - this is before I was born but you know
04:25 - there would be little pieces of cards
04:26 - and people would actually punch holes in
04:28 - them and put that little piece of card
04:30 - and the computer would find the holes
04:33 - and those holes would represent ones or
04:35 - zeros and that would tell the computer
04:37 - what the program was that was way way
04:39 - harder had but and it's got become
04:42 - easier every year it's going to become a
04:43 - little bit easier so twenty years from
04:45 - now it will be much much easier than it
04:46 - is today
04:50 - great our next school is Clayton
04:53 - Elementary from Canada classic what made
04:57 - you want to create the hour of code um
05:01 - so I didn't you know want to create the
05:05 - hour of code it's more like how did the
05:07 - idea come about you know I started code
05:10 - org because I it myself that's such a
05:14 - great I think
05:15 - her in the tech industry and I felt like
05:17 - it was so lucky that I got a chance to
05:19 - be even doing this you know when I
05:20 - started coding I lived in the country of
05:23 - earu
05:23 - and I grew up there during a war which
05:26 - was really not a great place to be
05:28 - raising a child but my dad gave me a
05:31 - computer one day and it didn't have any
05:33 - games on it and he said here's a book
05:35 - and if you can learn how to read the
05:36 - book you can figure out how to code and
05:38 - make your own games and apps and because
05:40 - I did by the time our family came to
05:42 - America even though we didn't have very
05:44 - yeah I was really good at coding and
05:47 - that helped me get some of the best jobs
05:49 - and I'm suited to be the American dream
05:51 - and I started code.org because I
05:54 - realized most schools it's not thirty
05:56 - since I started learning computer
05:58 - programming and still most schools in
05:59 - this country or really in any country
06:02 - including Canada don't give students the
06:05 - most basic exposure that I got when I
06:07 - was little and the opportunity that I'm
06:09 - living is one that most kids will never
06:10 - unlock in their lives if they don't get
06:13 - the same access in school
06:18 - great our next question is from Galileo
06:22 - STEM Academy and Idaho what types of
06:32 - problems or challenges did you come
06:34 - across when you created our code don't
06:43 - know I think it's tried again what types
06:50 - of problems or challenges did you come
06:52 - across when you created our oh good um
06:55 - when we created our of code by far the
06:59 - hardest problem was how little time we
07:01 - had you know the idea for the hour of
07:03 - code basically gelled together after
07:07 - many months of we know we're trying to
07:09 - figure out what could we do that
07:10 - everybody could participate in because
07:12 - you know 15,000 schools had reached out
07:14 - to code org at that point saying we want
07:16 - your help bringing computer
07:18 - all these Paulson's and celebrities and
07:21 - we'll just walk but to help us and we
07:24 - weren't sure what we could do that could
07:25 - engage all schools and all the people
07:27 - and then the idea for an a code came
07:29 - together at June 2013 in lieu so we had
07:34 - five and a half months to put together
07:36 - at that point I think there was me three
07:38 - or four of us at a code of
07:41 - we is if it wasn't Justin's we needed to
07:44 - do
07:50 - our schools you know read all these
07:55 - schools aren't able to get the present
07:57 - state they're all about but the hardest
08:04 - problem was a few people we had and
08:07 - hiring those people quickly enough and
08:09 - getting them on board and managing an
08:10 - incredibly tight time schedule but one
08:13 - thing we learned actually there's two
08:15 - things we learned one was that by
08:17 - setting an incredibly high goal you know
08:20 - we we shot for the you know we figured
08:22 - let's shoot for the moon and reach the
08:23 - Stars which is the opposite of how most
08:25 - people we set the goal of reaching 10
08:27 - million students in one week and that
08:29 - was such a big goal that it got a lot of
08:31 - people behind us and the other thing we
08:33 - learned is that you know because
08:35 - computer science education and learning
08:37 - to code is something that everybody
08:38 - supports even the most ridiculous
08:41 - request we we made of people you know
08:44 - people came through for us so you know
08:45 - even that first hour of code Google
08:47 - promoted it on their home page and we
08:50 - only had to ask once and that happened
08:52 - or you know the way the hour of code has
08:53 - been put into every single Apple store
08:55 - people have asked me how did you get
08:57 - them to do that it was actually the
09:00 - opposite they asked us if they could do
09:02 - that it was their idea which is really
09:04 - unheard of because you know most people
09:05 - don't get that much sort of free
09:07 - promotion and partnership from Apple and
09:10 - really we realized it's such a movement
09:12 - that everybody wants to help and that
09:13 - made it much more successful
09:18 - great our next question comes from
09:21 - Minnesota from North elementary school
09:27 - how is the concept of code.org created
09:33 - so the original concept of code.org was
09:36 - very different than where we are today
09:38 - when I started at the time it was
09:42 - basically just a hobby and all I wanted
09:43 - to do is make one video that explains
09:46 - that computer programming in computer
09:48 - science and coding are important and
09:49 - that you know our schools should be
09:51 - teaching it and our students should be
09:53 - learning it and this was kind of I
09:55 - wasn't working at the time and this was
09:57 - just sort of a side project for me and I
10:00 - recruited some of the best people that I
10:02 - knew or that I had contacts to in the
10:04 - tech industry to help so people like
10:07 - Bill Gates the the founder of Microsoft
10:09 - and the wealthiest man in the world or
10:11 - Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook
10:12 - or Jack Dorsey the founder of Twitter or
10:16 - you know bunch of these people I knew
10:18 - from working with them and then there
10:19 - were a handful of celebrities that I
10:21 - managed to call their agents and said
10:23 - you know I'm doing this thing with these
10:24 - other people can they be part of it and
10:26 - my only goal in life was just to make
10:29 - this video it took a few you know about
10:31 - six months we'll put the video down out
10:33 - on a website and then that was it um
10:35 - there really wasn't a plan for what we
10:36 - do next
10:37 - um but as the video game came together I
10:41 - realized I can't just put this video on
10:43 - my own personal YouTube page and you
10:45 - know it's got all these important people
10:46 - on it it kind of needs a website that's
10:48 - oh I need to have a website that the
10:50 - video goes on so you know I managed to
10:52 - get the name code.org and then put the
10:55 - video on the website and then having
10:57 - this video with all these important
10:59 - people on this website with such a great
11:00 - name created such a stir that a million
11:03 - sorry 10 million people looked at it in
11:05 - a week and 15,000 schools reached out
11:08 - and said you know can you help us bring
11:10 - this to her to our school and at that
11:12 - point literally it was just me in a
11:14 - video and this like really bare-bones
11:16 - websites but when we had you know the
11:18 - attention of 10 million people and
11:19 - 15,000 schools wanting computer science
11:22 - that's really what inspired me and it's
11:24 - it's really actually all the educators
11:26 - who wanted to bring computer science to
11:29 - their students into their classrooms
11:30 - that was the inspiration
11:31 - for making what is today the current
11:33 - code org and your since then I've been
11:36 - basically building a team hiring people
11:38 - building all the pieces of what code.org
11:41 - does whether it's the tutorials the hour
11:42 - of code everything great and that's how
11:47 - I ended up here
11:49 - Laura was actually I think maybe you
11:52 - know she was one of the first three
11:54 - people I met back then and convinced to
11:56 - join us hey our next question comes from
11:59 - Woodfin elementary school in North
12:01 - Carolina so I was 10 years old so I
12:16 - think I was in 4th grade at that time
12:18 - which is you know most people were early
12:22 - but I think had you know as we've shown
12:24 - with the hour of code it's not early
12:25 - that's like the right time for people to
12:27 - learn and back when I started the
12:29 - programming language I used was called
12:31 - basic on a computer called a Commodore
12:34 - 64 and back then computers were kind of
12:36 - bigger it was like this really big thing
12:38 - that didn't didn't have a mouse they
12:41 - didn't have color screens your
12:44 - programming wasn't nearly as much fun
12:47 - because you couldn't make really cool
12:48 - things but still the ability to tell a
12:51 - computer what to do and have it do it
12:52 - for you was really exciting
12:54 - AB and here there's a particular magic
12:57 - that you sense when you tell a computer
12:59 - to do one thing and then you tell it can
13:01 - you do that a thousand times and it does
13:03 - it a thousand times instant then you
13:06 - certainly realizing the computer can do
13:09 - something for you
13:09 - millions of times just by adding a few
13:12 - more zeros on the number it gives you
13:14 - just a real sense of power that you know
13:16 - there's nowhere else in the world there
13:18 - were no other way that you can say you
13:19 - know I want a million of something and
13:21 - you get it with instantaneous reaction
13:23 - and I think that was one of the lies
13:25 - about the power of these platforms great
13:30 - and our next question comes from tills
13:32 - elementary school in Arkansas um we've
13:41 - seen a significant interest in computer
13:43 - science since you gave me algorithm
13:46 - if the trend continues where you see
13:48 - Khoda continues so the question is where
13:52 - will I see coding in ten years you know
13:55 - my goal and the goal of code.org is that
13:57 - every school should teach computer
13:59 - science and you know the
14:03 - people should be learning this field you
14:06 - know we don't do an hour of math at once
14:08 - a year or an hour of science once a year
14:11 - you have like math all the time and
14:14 - science hopefully all the time or
14:16 - English reading writing these are things
14:18 - that are just part of school but
14:20 - computer science and coding aren't part
14:22 - of school and it's not like somebody's
14:24 - decided that they're not allowed to be
14:26 - part of schools just that they're kind
14:27 - of new most of what you learned in
14:29 - school is the same exact thing
14:31 - everybody's been learning for 150 years
14:34 - you know Matt hasn't changed in a
14:37 - thousand years the basics of
14:39 - multiplication and addition or
14:40 - subtraction or division those things
14:42 - have existed for as long as humanities
14:44 - existed it's not like somebody invented
14:47 - that or came up with it it's just
14:49 - counting and the English language also
14:51 - hasn't changed too much it's changing in
14:53 - thousand the last thousand years in the
14:55 - last hundred years it hasn't changed
14:56 - very much and so people have been
14:58 - teaching the same things as ever but
15:00 - computer programming computers have only
15:02 - been around you know less than a hundred
15:04 - years about 60 years and computer
15:06 - programming at the level at which a you
15:09 - know 10 year old can do it has only been
15:10 - possible for about 30 years and one one
15:13 - one thing that means is most of your
15:15 - teachers most of your parents have never
15:17 - done it themselves and most teachers
15:20 - parents adults are actually a little bit
15:22 - scared of it they think I'm not smart
15:23 - enough to do it and because it's new and
15:26 - different and I never learned it so if I
15:28 - never learned it you know maybe I can't
15:30 - do it myself
15:31 - so the the real challenge to getting
15:33 - this taught in schools is to the adults
15:36 - the parents all recognize that even if
15:38 - it's too scary for them or too new for
15:40 - them or foreign for them that it's not
15:42 - scary or foreign for today's children
15:44 - where we want to be in 10 years is that
15:47 - every school should teach computer
15:48 - science just like they teach math or
15:50 - English or science or biology it should
15:53 - be part of the full school system not
15:55 - just this thing you do one hour a year
15:57 - you know the one hour is just you know
16:00 - it's a great way to have fun and it's a
16:02 - great way to realize how much more than
16:04 - one hour there is to learn and it will
16:07 - go beyond one hour and do a much more
16:08 - learning whether it's using our
16:10 - tutorials or somebody else's
16:13 - great and we have a question from our
16:17 - Twitter feed this is from a student and
16:19 - Denver Colorado and they want to know
16:21 - what's something you'd want to make
16:24 - yourself with code that's a great
16:28 - question ad so there's two things I want
16:30 - to make myself with code and they're
16:32 - both pretty recent one is for my staff
16:37 - for the code or team I was hoping to
16:38 - make a Christmas card using our artist
16:42 - you know we have this little thing
16:44 - whether it's the Anna and Elsa version
16:45 - or the the default artist version where
16:48 - you give commands to draw squares or
16:50 - circles or Pentagon's or stars and I
16:54 - wanted to have that draw a Christmas
16:56 - tree and the particular challenge I
16:57 - wanted to give myself is to make it dry
16:59 - fractal Christmas tree where you know
17:01 - each branch itself is a little Christmas
17:03 - tree and each branch of the branch is a
17:05 - little Christmas tree M which is a
17:07 - little bit harder to do so I'm gonna
17:08 - need to maybe take some time over the
17:10 - Christmas break to do that's the other
17:13 - thing I want to make you know we've
17:15 - recently made this thing called app lab
17:17 - which makes it really easy to make apps
17:18 - and at the code.org offices we have a
17:21 - ping-pong table right now in front of me
17:24 - but there's a wall next to the ping-pong
17:26 - table where everybody has written their
17:27 - scores of hoobie tomb and it's literally
17:30 - written on the wall and we're running
17:31 - out of space on the wall so I was hoping
17:33 - to make an app so we can track the
17:35 - ping-pong scores on set inside the code
17:37 - or team to see who's has the most wins
17:39 - and and who's at the top of the ranks
17:45 - awesome
17:46 - well thanks howdy for joining us today
17:49 - in all these classrooms and we just
17:51 - wanna give you a big round of applause I
18:18 - wanted to say something in closing
18:20 - before I leave which is whether it's the
18:22 - students or the teachers please don't
18:24 - stop with one hour after all of you
18:26 - teachers over there I'm sure you can you
18:28 - can look em co.org we have tons of
18:30 - follow-on curriculum that you can take
18:32 - and if you haven't it those of you who
18:34 - are in elementary school in particular
18:35 - we have these great training workshops
18:38 - that are one-day workshops for teachers
18:39 - to basically learn going curriculum for
18:43 - your students and for the students whose
18:45 - teachers don't decide to do this first
18:48 - of all ask them to do it and tell them
18:49 - you want to do more coding but if you
18:52 - don't get to do it in the classroom I
18:53 - hope you can convince your mom or dad to
18:55 - go do it at home on a computer at home
18:56 - so thank you so much and please spread
19:00 - the word right I think sorry
