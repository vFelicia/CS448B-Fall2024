00:01 - welcome to code.org's second panel on
00:04 - engaging black students and teachers in
00:06 - computer science education
00:08 - my name is dr sabine thomas and i'm
00:10 - based here in tacoma washington i'm
00:12 - joined by my colleague leolin bowen who
00:15 - is based in austin texas we are leading
00:18 - and co-producing a panel conversation
00:20 - series on engaging black students and
00:22 - teachers in cs computer science
00:26 - leoland and i are both members of the
00:28 - education team here at code.org
00:30 - we know that black students make up 15
00:33 - of the overall students demographic
00:36 - 13
00:37 - of the demographic in school
00:39 - teaching
00:40 - advanced basement or ap computer science
00:42 - but only account for six percent
00:46 - of the students who take the apcs exam
00:50 - this is part of what we are here today
00:52 - to really unfold
00:54 - in the comment section below as this
00:57 - youtube rolls there is going to be
00:59 - information about engaging with us as
01:01 - you listen in today there's also going
01:04 - to be information about providing us
01:05 - some feedback at the end of this
01:07 - broadcast so that we can continue to
01:09 - share additional insight about this very
01:11 - important topic
01:13 - i'd like to start with our land
01:16 - acknowledgement as a way to honor our
01:18 - indigenous and native american presence
01:21 - as well as land rights in our everyday
01:23 - life
01:24 - and two to recognize the history of
01:26 - colonialism and a need for change in
01:29 - settlers colonial society we'll look
01:31 - closer to home here the coastal salish
01:34 - tribes from seattle as well as the pial
01:36 - tribe in tacoma
01:38 - and from the caribbean roots the tainos
01:40 - and kiskaya
01:41 - leolin my wonderful colleague will now
01:44 - introduce you to ice team moderator
01:47 - sheena glass welcome leoland
01:50 - thank you sabine before i introduce
01:52 - shayna i would also like to take a
01:54 - moment to recognize the indigenous and
01:56 - native presence here in austin texas
01:59 - we are in the land of the tribes of the
02:01 - humanos
02:02 - tokawa
02:04 - the pachen apache
02:06 - kuala
02:08 - in the comanche
02:10 - now i would like to introduce you to our
02:11 - moderator ms shayna glass
02:14 - shayna is currently the program director
02:16 - of technology applications and stem at
02:19 - aldine independent school district she
02:22 - has been in education for the last 16
02:24 - years educating students and teachers
02:26 - alike
02:27 - shayna holds a master's degree from sam
02:30 - houston state university in the field of
02:32 - curriculum and instruction with an
02:34 - emphasis in instructional technology
02:36 - she's a graduate from morgan state
02:38 - university receiving a ba in fine arts
02:41 - she is currently the president of the
02:43 - csta greater houston chapter as well as
02:46 - the code.org program manager for our
02:49 - regional partner at rice university
02:51 - school of mathematics
02:57 - go ahead and run it yourself i know i
03:00 - got it
03:02 - i want to take the time to thank both
03:04 - leoland and sabine for this opportunity
03:06 - not only for myself but for our students
03:08 - and teachers here in alden independent
03:10 - school district it is a pleasure to
03:12 - moderate this panel today you're going
03:14 - to hear from two students as well as two
03:17 - teachers here in computer science
03:19 - in my district martinez is a senior at
03:22 - blanson cte high school
03:24 - and is joined by luniqua who is a 9th
03:27 - grade student at davis 9th high school
03:30 - they will be joined by mr banks who's
03:32 - from blanson cte high school as well and
03:35 - miss hammons who's the computer science
03:37 - teacher at aldine ninth uh high school
03:41 - all here in houston texas
03:44 - perfect great shayna so we know that
03:46 - alden isd comprising comprises 15
03:49 - schools has over 95 representation of
03:52 - underrepresented groups in computer
03:54 - science so code.org defines
03:56 - underrepresented groups as black and
03:58 - african american hispanic latino latina
04:01 - latinx native american alaskan and
04:04 - native hawaiian and pacific islanders
04:07 - we also know that over 75 of the student
04:10 - population receives free reduced lunch
04:12 - based on socioeconomic status reported
04:14 - to school districts
04:16 - aldene isd is exactly the school
04:18 - district where we want to increase
04:19 - computer science representation
04:22 - so as you facilitated the panel
04:23 - conversation what are two surprising
04:25 - factors that were shared that you didn't
04:27 - expect to hear from the students and the
04:29 - teachers
04:30 - well one of the very first things that
04:33 - enlightened me
04:34 - was how
04:36 - even
04:37 - with the time this distance between our
04:39 - teachers and students of when they were
04:41 - exposed to computer science they both
04:43 - were brought in in very similar manners
04:45 - so time doesn't escape
04:47 - the way that they are
04:49 - gaining their first exposure to to the
04:51 - area the other thing that surprised me
04:53 - was the student representation of
04:55 - african americans in our high school
04:56 - classrooms in computer science
05:00 - hearing martinez describe in detail how
05:03 - the numbers of african american students
05:06 - in these classrooms drastically decrease
05:09 - year every year was a bit of a surprise
05:15 - thank you shayna
05:16 - and leoland
05:19 - everyone as you listen to our panel
05:22 - conversation today
05:24 - we'd like to ask you to give your
05:26 - undivided attention to our guest
05:28 - and to lend an ear to the conversation
05:31 - um around the term minority it was very
05:33 - interesting for me shayna and i see
05:35 - leolain shaking ahead
05:37 - as to how everyone conceived and
05:39 - perceive the term minority um lioland in
05:42 - your introduction you explicitly stated
05:44 - um how we are defining underrepresented
05:47 - groups here at code.org really in terms
05:49 - of you instead excuse me of using the
05:52 - term
05:53 - racial minority as we know that people
05:55 - of color today comprise the global
05:58 - majority
05:59 - um we also want to highlight that the
06:01 - students experience from aldene
06:04 - independent school district
06:06 - may or may not reflect the realities of
06:09 - all black students and teachers as our
06:11 - culture is incredibly rich
06:14 - non-monolithic and incredibly
06:17 - geographically um
06:18 - diverse so we are so delighted shayna
06:23 - to
06:24 - have you facilitate and moderate this
06:26 - panel today um
06:28 - we thank you and our students as well as
06:32 - well as the teachers
06:33 - and we now want to make sure that we
06:34 - have the opportunity to share a welcome
06:37 - address from our chief programs officer
06:40 - jackie smalls
06:41 - very quickly a bit about
06:44 - awesome
06:45 - cpo jackie smalls she has a rich
06:48 - background in stem education
06:51 - having served as the head of programs at
06:54 - black girls code and previously running
06:56 - professional learning programs for
06:58 - discovery education impacting tons of
07:01 - students and teachers
07:03 - she served as an environmental scientist
07:05 - in the u.s army
07:07 - yes she's a vet
07:09 - a school teacher
07:10 - and one of the standard writers on the
07:13 - next generation science standards she
07:16 - resides in southern maryland only
07:17 - minutes from the district of columbia in
07:19 - virginia
07:20 - and jackie proudly leads our education
07:23 - programs team
07:25 - we hope you enjoyed today's panel
07:27 - discussion as much as we did thank you
07:34 - on behalf of code.org i would like to
07:36 - extend a warm welcome to our viewers to
07:38 - code.org second panel in the series of
07:41 - engaging black students and teachers in
07:44 - computer science
07:45 - a heartfelt thank you to our panelists
07:47 - students martinius luniqua and teachers
07:51 - mr banks miss hammond
07:53 - and miss glass who are joining us from
07:56 - alden independent school district in
07:58 - houston texas we honor and respect your
08:01 - individual and collective experience
08:04 - with today's conversations centered
08:06 - around the experiences of black students
08:09 - and teachers in computer science we hope
08:12 - that teachers students and our
08:13 - stakeholders across the country will be
08:16 - inspired by their stories
08:18 - thank you and prepare yourself for an
08:20 - authentic and engaging discussion
08:27 - [Music]
08:49 - i want to welcome you all here for the
08:51 - conversation with us today on
08:54 - a real comfortable conversation on
08:57 - your journey into computer science
09:00 - so i'm going to start off with the first
09:02 - question
09:03 - and that question is
09:05 - what was your first experience or
09:07 - exposure to computer science
09:10 - and i think i want to ask miss hammond
09:13 - first
09:16 - hello everyone thank you for having me
09:19 - um
09:20 - my first experience or exposure to
09:24 - computer science was actually in college
09:27 - when i chose a major
09:29 - one of the required courses was fortran
09:35 - it was actually um not a great
09:38 - experience for me the class started out
09:41 - pretty good
09:42 - but
09:43 - um
09:45 - a week before the final project was due
09:50 - my
09:52 - project crashed and i could not figure
09:56 - out i worked day and night
09:59 - hours upon hours
10:02 - lots of tears trying to get my
10:04 - my crane to open and it never did
10:08 - um and my professor had absolutely no
10:12 - sympathy
10:14 - but that's okay
10:15 - um
10:16 - you know i take that experience i took
10:19 - that experience as an opportunity for me
10:22 - to rethink what it was i wanted to do
10:25 - for the rest of my life
10:27 - and i decided that chemical engineering
10:29 - was not for me
10:33 - mechanical engineering was not for me so
10:35 - i changed my major to chemistry
10:38 - so i do owe that professor
10:41 - a great deal of gratitude in that
10:45 - experience with fortran
10:47 - was an eye-opener for me
10:50 - um
10:51 - but when the chance came
10:54 - for alden isd to host computer science i
10:59 - remembered that course
11:01 - and i decided
11:02 - what better an opportunity for me to
11:05 - prove to myself that yes
11:08 - i can do it
11:09 - um
11:10 - so i'm thankful thank you miss glass for
11:13 - extending to me the opportunity
11:17 - absolutely absolutely let's go to a
11:20 - student martinez what was your first
11:24 - experience
11:25 - um or exposure to computer science
11:29 - i believe my first experience with
11:31 - computer science would be somewhere in
11:33 - the summer of the seventh grade year so
11:36 - sometime in middle school
11:38 - uh
11:39 - a lot of it was just me experimenting i
11:42 - found joy in just sitting there and
11:43 - creating things so i ended up teaching
11:46 - myself a little bit about multiple
11:49 - uh game development softwares because
11:51 - that's what i kind of lean more towards
11:53 - the game development side of computer
11:55 - science and i kind of just taught myself
11:58 - a little bit about everything over
12:00 - summer until i was able to finally get
12:01 - into a school like blanson where i can
12:04 - kind of prioritize
12:05 - learn in different coding languages such
12:07 - as java python and really reinforcing my
12:10 - foundation
12:13 - excellent excellent
12:14 - let's come back to a teacher mr banks
12:17 - what was your first exposure or
12:19 - experience with computer science
12:23 - my first my first exposure to computer
12:25 - science were in college
12:27 - uh i did not
12:29 - decide to major in computer science
12:31 - until the last minute
12:32 - uh when i went to my freshman
12:34 - orientation i was late
12:37 - and when i got there there were a lot of
12:38 - different lines going in different
12:40 - directions
12:41 - i picked the shortest line at the time
12:44 - which was computer science not knowing
12:46 - it was the longest line because the line
12:48 - went out the door around the corner into
12:50 - another building uh yeah that's how i
12:53 - got into computer science uh but once i
12:56 - we started talking about computer
12:57 - science and talked about a lot of math
12:59 - and at the time i really didn't like
13:00 - math i was okay in it but i wasn't
13:02 - really
13:03 - good at it because
13:05 - it was math at the time right
13:08 - but uh we used
13:09 - punch cards back then we had to program
13:12 - a program we had to write our programs
13:14 - and then put our program on a punch card
13:17 - so once you get your programs on a punch
13:19 - card you have to take your punch card or
13:21 - your stack of punch cards to another
13:23 - machine to run your program
13:25 - and one day i tripped and my cards went
13:28 - all over the place
13:30 - and had to start all over again because
13:33 - the punch cards were not numbered yeah
13:35 - yeah it was interesting
13:37 - the punch cards were not numbered so i
13:39 - had to go back and reprogram my whole
13:41 - program get all my stack of punch cards
13:44 - again and put it in the machine to get
13:46 - it to work that's how i got introduced
13:49 - into
13:50 - computer science
13:53 - wow
13:55 - wow
13:56 - well we think you did you need to get by
13:57 - for 30 years
14:00 - wow
14:02 - luniqua
14:04 - lunique what can you share with us your
14:05 - first experience or exposure to computer
14:07 - science
14:09 - um
14:10 - my first experience
14:13 - was in seventh grade it was just like a
14:16 - very very short introduction
14:19 - um
14:20 - it was like math class and since we were
14:23 - basically done with everything for the
14:25 - year my teacher just was just like oh
14:28 - we're gonna start coding but it only
14:30 - lasted for a day so
14:33 - yeah
14:35 - my real like real full experience is
14:38 - this year though
14:39 - so
14:42 - excellent excellent so i'm gonna i'm
14:45 - gonna start with the students again this
14:48 - round
14:49 - i know both of you have different
14:51 - experiences um and opportunities in
14:54 - computer science but what i really want
14:56 - to know is
14:58 - what keeps you motivated to keep
15:00 - programming like what
15:02 - what keeps you wanting to come to class
15:04 - especially now
15:06 - what keeps you
15:08 - coming back
15:11 - let's start with
15:13 - laniqua nico answer that for me what
15:15 - what motivates you to keep coming to
15:17 - your teacher's class
15:19 - um
15:20 - i think the main thing that motivates me
15:22 - is
15:24 - the fact that i i really enjoy coding
15:27 - i i don't know it's just really fun and
15:31 - i
15:32 - most of the time i feel relaxed when i'm
15:34 - coding so
15:36 - it and
15:38 - that feelings you know you just keep
15:40 - wanting to do it again and again so
15:45 - what helps you stay challenged in that
15:47 - class
15:49 - um
15:50 - the new lessons that we get every week
15:53 - is is progressively getting harder
15:55 - so
15:56 - i'm having more
15:58 - challenges that
16:00 - i i need my teacher to help me with
16:03 - but overall yeah
16:06 - um
16:07 - it's getting more challenging as we go
16:09 - but relatively it's not that bad
16:13 - thank you uh
16:15 - thank you for keep for coming back we
16:18 - know that that can be it can be
16:20 - challenging from the teacher's
16:21 - standpoint
16:22 - martinez what motivates you to keep
16:25 - programming especially
16:27 - yeah
16:28 - to
16:29 - these these challenges that you face
16:31 - where you are
16:32 - a high school senior
16:34 - where
16:35 - what keeps you motivated in computer
16:37 - science
16:38 - okay all right uh i really actually like
16:40 - this question because i feel like
16:42 - a lot of computer science students or
16:45 - people in general will drop out of their
16:49 - i guess their their goal
16:51 - uh because just lack of motivation and
16:54 - especially if you look into the game
16:56 - development feel that's a lot that's the
16:58 - biggest issue at the moment is just lack
17:00 - of motivation to continue your project
17:02 - due to like just repetitive actions you
17:04 - know coding is something where you'll
17:05 - end up doing the same thing
17:07 - a million times over
17:08 - uh but for me what really kept me
17:10 - motivated uh was just the people in my
17:13 - class it was really enjoyable going to
17:16 - class and helping the other people in
17:17 - the classroom
17:18 - seeing them learn a bit more and then
17:20 - helping myself as well
17:22 - throughout that process our teacher also
17:24 - made it uh really fun to engage in class
17:27 - we had a lot of assignments where
17:29 - we after learning like a long course
17:32 - we'd go on to make a small game to
17:34 - complement it and maybe we learned how
17:36 - to use print statements and we'd make a
17:38 - text-based adventure game and that just
17:41 - kept everyone engaged and
17:43 - it kept our attention and i feel like
17:45 - that really helped keep us going
17:48 - but as it pertains to outside of the
17:50 - classroom my biggest motivation would
17:52 - definitely be my friends
17:54 - i do have like a little discord channel
17:56 - i'll be in for a large amount of time
17:59 - and whenever i work on projects or make
18:01 - games i'll post it in there and then
18:03 - they'll play it and we'll just kind of
18:04 - go over it
18:07 - i like that so i'm going to piggyback
18:09 - off of that question martinius
18:11 - and ask you um
18:13 - you both you and laniqua stay on the
18:15 - student side um so do you enjoy what
18:18 - you're learning in class are you
18:20 - enjoying the curriculum
18:22 - and then there's a two-part question
18:25 - does it reflect your culture
18:27 - so the focus of today is
18:29 - how do we recruit african-american
18:32 - students and teachers into computer
18:34 - science
18:35 - do you see yourself
18:37 - in your class
18:39 - let me start with you martinius
18:43 - okay i definitely believe that
18:46 - and just to make sure that i'm getting
18:47 - this right can you repeat the first
18:48 - portion of that question so are you
18:51 - enjoying what you're learning based off
18:52 - of what you said previous
18:55 - i'm going to assume that you do but
18:58 - i'm asking more on the cultural side
19:01 - are you enjoying what you're learning do
19:03 - you see your culture reflected in what
19:05 - you're learning
19:06 - and
19:07 - [Music]
19:08 - more just generally do you see yourself
19:11 - in your class
19:13 - in computer science class
19:15 - i definitely do see myself in computer
19:18 - science class but i think that's
19:19 - something based on
19:21 - an individual i feel like it is what you
19:23 - make of it so when i enter that
19:26 - classroom and when we're given projects
19:28 - there's a certain level of individuality
19:30 - to it so you can choose what you want to
19:32 - do and how you do it so there's no set
19:35 - path to complete an assignment for
19:37 - example
19:38 - and even though most assignments might
19:39 - be something like simply completing
19:43 - a equation or making a calculator there
19:45 - are times where you get to add your own
19:48 - little touch to things and i feel like
19:50 - that's where you can incorporate your
19:52 - culture
19:53 - i know for me
19:55 - working on assignments such as
19:57 - and this doesn't really pertain to
19:59 - computer programming but when i was
20:00 - working on my business management
20:02 - assignments
20:03 - for stuff like coming up with restaurant
20:05 - ideas i would join my culture a jamaican
20:09 - born i'd maybe make a restaurant
20:11 - caribbean delight that sells
20:13 - jamaican-based products and i do the
20:15 - same thing with my programs for example
20:17 - you can set variable names to something
20:19 - related to your culture
20:21 - and that's kind of just how i keep
20:22 - myself incorporated and i definitely do
20:25 - see myself in my classroom
20:30 - okay luniqua tell me
20:32 - do you see yourself reflected in your
20:35 - computer science classroom
20:37 - um
20:38 - in in the class that you take now
20:40 - do you see yourself in what you're
20:42 - learning
20:45 - um
20:46 - i never really thought about it i
20:49 - i don't
20:53 - i don't necessarily see myself
20:57 - like
20:58 - i mean i see other students that look
21:00 - like me
21:01 - but i don't
21:02 - when i first think of computer science i
21:04 - don't think of
21:06 - myself
21:08 - if that makes sense um
21:10 - yes it is can you explain why or what
21:14 - what what did you first see
21:16 - when you think computer science
21:21 - i don't know someone with lighter skin
21:24 - yes
21:25 - like just stem based careers in general
21:29 - is just like people with lighter skin
21:33 - um so i never really consider computer
21:36 - science or anything like that
21:40 - oh
21:41 - i i don't i've never really incorporated
21:45 - my culture because
21:48 - i don't i don't know how
21:50 - i would go about incorporating it when i
21:53 - do my assignments
21:55 - and
21:57 - yeah
22:00 - i think i think you've you've answered
22:02 - it very well um
22:05 - both of you did actually i'm going to
22:07 - come over to the teacher side now and
22:09 - i'm going to ask you you both
22:11 - ms hammonds and mr banks some directed
22:14 - questions based off of their responses
22:17 - so thinking about the number of students
22:18 - in both of your classes
22:21 - what percentage are
22:23 - girls
22:24 - what is an un the underrepresented
22:26 - population uh prefacing that aldean
22:30 - represents mainly underrepresented popul
22:35 - relations
22:36 - um how many of the students in your
22:39 - class look like you
22:42 - so i'm bringing this now to mr banks and
22:44 - it's hammonds let's start with you miss
22:46 - hammonds
22:51 - so
22:52 - when i look at the dynamics of my
22:54 - students um
22:57 - let's start with gender
22:59 - we purposefully
23:01 - when scheduling our students
23:03 - went for
23:05 - making sure that our female students
23:08 - was populated
23:10 - because it was important for us to
23:14 - let them know that these are
23:16 - opportunities for them in the field of
23:18 - computer science
23:20 - and let them know that we are looking to
23:23 - help female students grow in that area
23:26 - so
23:27 - me being a female
23:30 - i wanted to make sure that
23:32 - yes we need females get them in there so
23:35 - i would say that um off the top of my
23:39 - head
23:41 - not 85 percent of our students are
23:43 - female
23:44 - in
23:45 - at my campus
23:47 - um
23:49 - in terms of uh people who look like me
23:52 - african-american
23:54 - we have
23:55 - two
23:57 - and
23:58 - that's not a lot
24:00 - considering i have 25 students in the
24:03 - class and only two of them are
24:05 - african-american
24:07 - um
24:08 - but i i think it's more because of the
24:10 - campus that i'm at
24:12 - it's 90
24:14 - hispanic
24:16 - so
24:17 - um for computer science they had to have
24:20 - taken algebra 1
24:22 - um as a pre-req
24:24 - so that limits
24:26 - the number of students we can pull from
24:29 - so i'm hoping that next year we'll have
24:32 - more of an even spread
24:35 - of african-american and hispanic
24:37 - students
24:39 - and definitely
24:41 - still sticking with encouraging our
24:43 - female students to get involved with
24:45 - computer science
24:47 - absolutely mr banks tell me about your
24:50 - classes
25:07 - i'm mute force mr banks
25:18 - okay sorry about that
25:20 - can you hear me now
25:23 - okay
25:24 - um
25:25 - four is the percentages of male versus
25:27 - female is about 85 percent male and 15
25:31 - female in my classes
25:34 - uh as far as
25:36 - the percentages of
25:38 - students that look like me it's probably
25:40 - about 25 percent african-american
25:43 - students and
25:45 - 75 hispanic students
25:50 - okay
25:51 - martinez
25:53 - has requested to to elaborate on this
25:55 - question as well uh martinez go ahead
25:58 - and share with us um from your
25:59 - perspective
26:02 - okay so for me i know that when we first
26:05 - started our first year in our computer
26:07 - programming we actually had a fairly
26:09 - even split of students in terms of
26:11 - demographic
26:13 - but as the years continued i know in the
26:15 - second year i believe we lost
26:17 - almost half of the class
26:19 - so in terms of like we were saying
26:22 - earlier about people who stick into the
26:24 - class to the motivation i definitely
26:25 - feel like
26:27 - there's a large amount of people that we
26:28 - do lose over time it's not necessarily
26:30 - that it'll start in the field it's more
26:32 - or less that they drop out
26:34 - and a large amount of that are people
26:36 - that are
26:37 - like me for example i did do a
26:41 - little after school girls who code event
26:43 - but i showed up as a assistant to help
26:47 - mandate the students and help them out a
26:48 - bit and i know that we start off with i
26:51 - believe around four students on the
26:52 - first day
26:54 - female students and that number dropped
26:56 - down to about two but i am glad that
26:58 - they did stick around until the end
27:02 - i remember that day
27:04 - distinctively i remember going over to
27:07 - blanson when you guys kicked off girls
27:09 - who code
27:10 - and
27:12 - it was
27:14 - i was intimidated
27:16 - there was so many guys um
27:19 - and the girls kind of huddled and they
27:21 - were kind of shy but
27:23 - um i'm glad to know that that a couple
27:26 - are sticking sticking with it and and
27:28 - coming through and you are right it is
27:30 - about um
27:32 - perseverance right
27:35 - so
27:36 - let's go let's keep going let's keep
27:38 - going um
27:40 - i'm gonna ask this question about
27:42 - sticking with with uh us talking about
27:45 - people who look like us let's define
27:47 - minority
27:49 - so
27:51 - when we think minority
27:53 - we think
27:54 - of us as a minority but if you look at
27:57 - us globally
27:59 - we're actually the majority
28:01 - right so
28:03 - when it comes to your class
28:06 - are you seeing
28:08 - meaning and you know minority
28:12 - here in aldine minority we come in all
28:15 - shades of melanin actually we're
28:17 - speaking on hispanic and um an
28:20 - african-american
28:22 - but
28:25 - how would you define
28:26 - minority when it comes to
28:29 - people that look like us
28:30 - how would you define minority in your
28:32 - classroom
28:34 - and i'm asking for like your definition
28:37 - of minority
28:39 - knowing that we are the global minority
28:42 - majority sorry we are the majority
28:45 - globally
28:47 - but how would you define it now
28:51 - let's start with you miss hammonds
28:56 - so when i think of
28:59 - minority
29:00 - um
29:02 - i think of
29:06 - everyone who is non-anglo
29:09 - non-white
29:10 - and that's my definition of
29:14 - minority
29:15 - so if i'm putting it in terms of my
29:18 - classroom 100 of my students are
29:21 - minority
29:22 - because i have no white students
29:25 - all of my students are either
29:27 - african-american
29:29 - hispanic descent
29:31 - or
29:32 - of asian descent so
29:36 - that's how i would define minority
29:39 - okay mr banks how would you define
29:40 - minority
29:45 - uh mute yourself for me
29:49 - sorry about that
29:51 - you're fine
29:53 - i have to agree with what you just said
29:56 - uh we're all minority of our at uh
29:58 - blanson in my classes uh
30:00 - african-american hispanic and asian uh
30:04 - there are no uh white students in my
30:06 - classes so i would agree with what you
30:08 - just said
30:10 - okay so now i want to hear from the
30:11 - students because i'm really curious if
30:14 - your definition of minority is the same
30:16 - as the teachers
30:17 - so martinez do you consider
30:21 - yourself
30:22 - a minority in your classroom
30:26 - okay so for me i guess the definition of
30:29 - minorities is a little bit different
30:32 - i like to think of minority as those who
30:34 - lack opportunities whether that's due to
30:36 - this their environmental circumstances
30:38 - or
30:40 - just how they've been grown in
30:42 - you know over time
30:44 - so for me
30:46 - minorities can be anyone in a sense
30:49 - of course we usually find minorities to
30:51 - be those of
30:53 - my
30:54 - character
30:56 - just due to
30:57 - a lot of environmental or situational
30:59 - circumstances
31:01 - because like you said before we are the
31:03 - majority even though we are
31:05 - seen as the minority and yeah like i
31:08 - think that's a that's just it has to do
31:10 - with a lot of situations so where you
31:12 - grow up and the opportunities you were
31:14 - given i know uh miss hammond said that
31:18 - she was looking for a wider bracket of
31:20 - students to choose from but algebra one
31:22 - was a requirement
31:24 - and
31:25 - that kind of shows that the minority
31:27 - there are those without the opportunity
31:29 - to take that class
31:32 - excellent excellent feedback uh lunique
31:35 - what your thoughts what is your
31:37 - definition of minority
31:40 - um
31:41 - um i think my definition of minority is
31:44 - more like the teachers
31:47 - um
31:48 - just as like not as like in the
31:51 - world and the world because you know and
31:54 - that you know in the world we're the
31:55 - majority but for someone living in the
31:57 - united states we would be considered the
32:00 - minority
32:02 - and
32:03 - with my classes
32:06 - basically everyone's a minority
32:09 - if you live in the united states
32:12 - i i guess if if we were talking on a
32:15 - global scale i guess it would change but
32:18 - for now it's it's like
32:21 - non
32:23 - i guess just poc
32:28 - yeah yeah
32:29 - i would i would agree with you
32:31 - um
32:33 - let's talk about
32:36 - let's talk about recruiting
32:38 - okay so
32:40 - i'm gonna start with the teachers
32:42 - what are some obstacles that you
32:45 - currently face in engaging and
32:47 - recruiting um black students into your
32:50 - classes
32:51 - mr banks tell me what tell me your
32:53 - thoughts
32:56 - unmute yourself
33:02 - you can tell this is my first time doing
33:03 - this
33:05 - uh i really don't have any obstacles
33:07 - because this is my first time first year
33:09 - teaching so i really haven't had the
33:11 - opportunity to recruit
33:13 - so i really don't have an answer for
33:15 - that particular question have you
33:17 - started recruiting for next year
33:20 - i have um i've talked to all the
33:23 - students in my class and i get to out i
33:25 - ask the kids to get the word out
33:28 - to their friends that might be
33:29 - interested
33:31 - you know word of mouth sometimes
33:33 - go a long way
33:36 - miss hammonds how about over at um audi
33:39 - 9th at your campus
33:40 - what do you what are some obstacles that
33:42 - you you see engaging in recruiting
33:45 - um black students not only to come to
33:47 - your class from from middle school right
33:50 - but from your current students to keep
33:53 - going
33:55 - so
33:56 - um
33:58 - let's tackle that first part
34:02 - in the fact that
34:05 - just like martinez martinez said
34:08 - um that requirement of that prereq of
34:11 - algebra really limits the student
34:14 - pool that we have
34:16 - so when i think of recruiting for
34:19 - computer science
34:20 - i also have to think of recruiting for
34:22 - algebra one
34:24 - on my campus i am the algebra or the
34:27 - department chair and the skill
34:29 - specialist for algebra so um
34:32 - they work hand in hand
34:34 - so i need to push for more
34:39 - minorities to be involved in the algebra
34:43 - strand in middle school if i have any
34:46 - hopes of increasing the minorities in
34:50 - computer science in high school yes
34:53 - ma'am you are absolutely correct i have
34:55 - to jump in on that part of the
34:57 - conversation because i am finding that
34:59 - that is something that is um definitely
35:03 - a hurdle here in in texas as it might be
35:07 - nationally um trying to trying to push
35:09 - for the advancement of mathematics in
35:12 - students
35:13 - um luniqua and martinez
35:16 - um
35:17 - how do you feel about engaging with your
35:20 - classmates
35:22 - that aren't in your computer science
35:23 - class
35:24 - to encourage them have you spoken to
35:27 - your classmates
35:28 - um in regards to
35:33 - the classes you're taking this computer
35:35 - science class hey are you interested
35:38 - um lunique i'm gonna start with you as a
35:39 - ninth grader
35:41 - and i'm recruiting you right i'm i'm
35:45 - taking charge to like did you know did
35:48 - you know did you know but do you speak
35:50 - to your friends that like are you
35:52 - explaining to them what you're doing do
35:53 - you have those conversations
35:57 - um i i rarely talk to my classmates if i
36:01 - don't already know them because i'm
36:02 - virtual
36:04 - but
36:05 - i don't i don't think i necessarily talk
36:07 - to them about computer science i might
36:09 - show them like a project i'm doing like
36:12 - oh this is so cool this is so fun you
36:14 - should try it out or something like that
36:16 - that's probably the extent
36:19 - like i've gotten one of my friends she
36:20 - isn't in all beans
36:22 - she's in a different district but i got
36:25 - her to sign up for the summer immersion
36:28 - program
36:29 - so
36:30 - yeah
36:35 - truly appreciate that for your
36:37 - recruitment
36:38 - you don't know just just as mr bank
36:41 - stated that goes a very long way when
36:44 - you hear word of mouth and if there's
36:46 - something that you're doing definitely
36:48 - bring a friend along right because
36:50 - maybe in the district they're in it's
36:52 - not just about where we are
36:54 - we need the this nationally so i
36:57 - appreciate that
36:59 - that's the start that's the start that's
37:01 - the start
37:02 - martinez tell me how you
37:05 - um
37:07 - talk with friends who aren't in your
37:09 - computer science classes
37:11 - okay so for me i actually do this quite
37:15 - often because i really like what i do
37:18 - and like i said before i like to make
37:20 - little small mini projects and
37:22 - back when there wasn't as much
37:24 - restrictions covered 19 wise i used to
37:27 - actually after creating these small
37:29 - projects i just showcased them to either
37:32 - close friends or just people sitting at
37:33 - the table to kind of just get their
37:35 - attention
37:36 - and that usually leads to someone maybe
37:38 - find an interest in it i know there are
37:40 - a few people who have had
37:42 - uh come to the computer programming
37:44 - class and i'll help them out
37:46 - just to kind of keep them on i know
37:47 - there's a few people have thought about
37:49 - i'll even and i just give them that
37:50 - little extra push
37:52 - to kind of help them
37:54 - along so i definitely think that i do do
37:57 - a bit of recruiting even though not
38:00 - intentional it's more or less just me
38:02 - trying to get feedback on my work
38:04 - uh and yeah
38:08 - i give kudos to both of you because
38:11 - both of them you both are helping the
38:13 - two teachers on this call
38:16 - those are things that they need to hear
38:18 - okay so let's talk about um a tiny
38:20 - elephant not a big elephant but a tiny
38:22 - elephant since you brought up the coven
38:25 - 19 restrictions
38:26 - um
38:27 - and this may be in the time of
38:30 - where you're both virtual students right
38:33 - or
38:34 - when everything was normal
38:37 - let's talk about your social emotional
38:38 - health
38:39 - and this is on both fronts both student
38:41 - and teacher
38:42 - around computer science
38:45 - how
38:46 - from the student lens
38:49 - how
38:50 - how are you doing with all of the
38:52 - workload that you have and the focus
38:55 - with the challenges in computer science
38:57 - right your the assignments like luniqua
38:59 - you said you know every week it's a new
39:01 - assignment it gets a little more
39:02 - challenging how do you balance that
39:06 - with all of your other classes
39:08 - and still continue to come
39:11 - let me go i'ma start with you and then
39:12 - martinius i want to hear from you and
39:14 - then we'll come to the teachers and i'm
39:16 - gonna rephrase that question just a
39:17 - little bit
39:18 - go ahead laniqua
39:21 - oh
39:26 - i got a question how do you balance the
39:30 - challenge in computer science the work
39:32 - the amount of work
39:34 - you have a very challenging teacher
39:37 - he likes to just give it to you giving a
39:39 - shout out to mr gunther ever at uh
39:43 - over at um davis ninth high school he
39:47 - he's he's a stickler you know i know i
39:50 - know how he works
39:52 - um
39:53 - how do you balance that
39:55 - along with all of the work of your other
39:57 - classes
39:58 - uh for our class
40:01 - uh it's not the workload isn't that bad
40:04 - and also mr glinter is very helpful
40:08 - so
40:09 - i can always go to office hours or email
40:12 - him and
40:13 - say oh this is what i need help with if
40:16 - you have time can you help me with this
40:18 - or something
40:19 - so it's a very it's really easy to
40:22 - balance the class
40:24 - with everything else going on
40:29 - excellent martini is how do you balance
40:32 - your workload in computer science and
40:34 - all
40:35 - of those other classes
40:39 - i actually haven't found much issue
40:41 - balance in my computer science workload
40:44 - and i believe that's just because i
40:45 - prioritize it over my other work
40:49 - i like to think of computer programming
40:51 - as either my mind my mid or end goal
40:54 - it's something i want to do in the
40:55 - future and continue doing
40:57 - so i tend to take more care of my
41:00 - computer science work
41:02 - and i think that's probably what's
41:04 - helped me keep my workload down to a
41:06 - minimum minimum
41:08 - we appreciate that we appreciate that
41:12 - uh we will definitely be sharing this
41:14 - with your students ms hammond and mr
41:15 - banks
41:17 - so let me rephrase that question for mr
41:20 - banks and ms hammond
41:23 - how
41:24 - are you doing
41:26 - with the workload
41:29 - of trying to get students
41:32 - to
41:33 - do the work when you know that they have
41:36 - all these other classes both of these
41:38 - students are excellent
41:39 - but
41:41 - how is it with your your classes your
41:43 - computer science classes uh miss hammond
41:46 - we'll start with you how is it going for
41:47 - your students
41:49 - and you
41:50 - okay
41:51 - so
41:52 - um
41:55 - i'm in a unique situation where this is
41:58 - my first year teaching computer science
42:02 - so
42:03 - i'm learning
42:04 - at the same time as my students
42:09 - so
42:10 - just like
42:11 - martini has said i have to prioritize
42:15 - but because i feel like this is
42:17 - something that i want to continue to
42:19 - teach
42:20 - i make sure that on my own front when i
42:23 - finish learning in class with my
42:25 - students during class time that i also
42:29 - learn after work
42:31 - on weekends on saturdays like today
42:34 - so i'm continuing to grow
42:37 - my own in my own way in terms of how to
42:40 - get students to prioritize i have 25
42:44 - students
42:45 - and i can honestly say that
42:47 - unfortunately of those 25 students only
42:51 - a handful actually
42:53 - started with the program and are
42:56 - continuing to work and are
42:58 - current in their um their learning
43:02 - who reach out to me when they need help
43:07 - so
43:09 - i want to say it's because of the
43:11 - virtual environment that we're in
43:14 - that i'm not seeing as much success as i
43:16 - had hoped
43:18 - and i'm really looking forward to next
43:20 - year when we are more face to face
43:24 - in
43:25 - helping to motivate and
43:28 - because i can only call home so many
43:30 - times
43:31 - to get them to try to come to class and
43:33 - see the value in the class and enjoy it
43:36 - as much as i do
43:38 - but if they can't see me and they can't
43:40 - see my enthusiasm then it's hard for
43:43 - them to get motivated to do the work
43:45 - so
43:46 - um
43:48 - i struggle at times with ways to
43:51 - motivate students so i'm happy to hear
43:54 - from our two students today
43:57 - to
43:58 - try to take back some things that i can
44:00 - do differently to encourage our students
44:03 - to get more involved
44:05 - i agree with you i completely agree with
44:07 - you mr banks tell me how how is
44:12 - um how are you balancing
44:15 - the the social emotional needs of your
44:18 - students
44:19 - with your with the workload as you're
44:21 - teaching
44:22 - cs2 csa right you you have a different
44:25 - level
44:26 - of coursework
44:29 - and and if they're in that class they
44:31 - have a hefty amount of coursework as
44:34 - well in all of their other classes
44:37 - um how are you managing that and how are
44:39 - they handling it
44:41 - i think the best way that i'm managing
44:44 - it is that i try to keep it fun
44:46 - you know my students that are
44:48 - virtual they don't get the opportunity
44:51 - to see me have fun so i have videos that
44:54 - they can actually join in
44:56 - to an actual classroom and they can see
44:59 - how the other kids are having fun in
45:01 - class we do a lot of projects on the
45:02 - board we do we have like projects where
45:05 - we play games
45:07 - uh and the the students that are at home
45:09 - notice that wow we missed this i missed
45:12 - this so next thing i know during the
45:13 - classroom
45:15 - they change it from virtual to classroom
45:17 - because they want to have fun as well
45:19 - i like that
45:21 - i don't have any really issues i just as
45:24 - long as we're having fun and learning
45:27 - and
45:28 - that's i think that's why they're
45:28 - telling their friends we're having mr
45:30 - banks is having fun what do you think
45:32 - about coming to his class or do you want
45:34 - to know about mr banks like first thing
45:36 - they say is who is mr banks because i
45:38 - wasn't there last year so this is my
45:40 - first year there
45:41 - now i have people come by hi mr banks
45:43 - how you doing that used to walk by me
45:45 - just don't say anything so they have a
45:46 - lot of fun in my class so i like that i
45:49 - like that
45:50 - um for both teachers um what supports do
45:53 - you have in place to support you
45:55 - in your instructional needs as both of
45:58 - you
45:59 - are new into
46:01 - so mr banks you're not new to computer
46:03 - science you're new to aldine but miss
46:05 - hammonds you're not new to alden but
46:07 - you're new to computer science so what
46:09 - supports do you both it's true it's true
46:12 - you guys are like the you're the reverse
46:15 - of each other
46:16 - uh mr banks um and ms hammons let's
46:19 - start miss hammons samus what supports
46:21 - do you have in place
46:22 - um to support you as you're going
46:24 - through this journey
46:26 - well um
46:28 - i have to say that my teals volunteers
46:31 - have been
46:32 - absolutely amazing
46:35 - they have thought outside the box for
46:38 - how to encourage our students ways that
46:41 - we can provide incentives to motivate
46:44 - our students to do the assignments and
46:46 - to learn computer science
46:48 - not only do they work with the students
46:50 - but they always ask miss hammond what
46:52 - are you working on in your course
46:54 - because they know that i'm studying to
46:57 - take my exam
46:58 - for computer science they're always
47:01 - willing to help and provide me support
47:03 - so
47:04 - i am so blessed and fortunate to have
47:06 - the tills volunteers to help me in
47:10 - addition to
47:11 - the teals volunteers i also have a great
47:14 - network
47:16 - of um
47:18 - of instructors that are teaching me the
47:21 - found the
47:23 - um
47:26 - people who helped students initiatives
47:28 - yeah yes the initiative through of the
47:31 - partnership with university of texas so
47:33 - i'm grateful and
47:36 - i haven't taken my court my test yet i'm
47:38 - looking forward to it but i do feel like
47:41 - it's very beneficial and um
47:45 - i'm excited about the opportunities that
47:47 - are to come
47:50 - mr banks tell me about your supports
47:54 - to support your needs
47:56 - i would have to agree with my assistants
47:58 - uh teal's assistants they're outstanding
48:01 - outstanding this is my first time
48:03 - actually with assistance and they just
48:05 - outstanding that's the best way to
48:06 - explain it um
48:08 - or is the
48:11 - uh
48:12 - i guess force the support of my uh uh
48:16 - teachers the teachers in this
48:17 - administration at blanson they're
48:19 - outstanding
48:20 - you know me being new to alden
48:24 - i mean i couldn't have a better staff a
48:25 - better
48:26 - administration i think i i just love it
48:29 - i'm having a great time i'm having more
48:31 - fun than anything and i think that could
48:32 - be bad i'm having more fun than probably
48:35 - some of the kids that's a good thing you
48:37 - need
48:38 - teachers need if the teacher's having
48:40 - fun it makes the students want to have
48:41 - fun
48:42 - right um miss hammond's uh the question
48:45 - came up about what
48:47 - e d i is it's computing um i just want
48:49 - to explain it to the audience that the
48:51 - cdei is a initiative that is in
48:54 - partnership with the university of texas
48:56 - where they were recruiting minority
48:57 - teachers
48:58 - um teachers of color
49:00 - trying to help them to gain the
49:02 - certification to teach computer science
49:05 - so it's computing educator diversity
49:07 - initiative
49:08 - and they recruited uh teachers and i
49:12 - sent it out to the entire district and
49:14 - we have six teachers uh actually in a
49:16 - cohort here in aldine who are a part of
49:19 - that program to bring more um minority
49:22 - teachers into computer science so miss
49:25 - hammons is is she's trucking along um in
49:28 - this in this journey and she's gonna be
49:31 - extremely successful um as we keep going
49:34 - and it's a magnificent program so
49:36 - um i'm just
49:37 - super honored that that she took that
49:40 - took that took that you know that baton
49:42 - and and ran with it because that's
49:45 - that's um
49:47 - that's what's needed
49:48 - um
49:50 - let's see
49:51 - another question i have for you all is
49:54 - how is this contributing to your overall
49:58 - growth
49:59 - so
50:01 - leniqua
50:03 - tell me how being in this class
50:06 - where do you
50:08 - you and
50:09 - we we partnered all of you all
50:11 - strategically liniqua you are starting
50:13 - your journey
50:15 - martinez you are starting the next phase
50:17 - of your journey right
50:20 - liniqua how do you see this
50:23 - moving forward so we've had a
50:25 - conversation
50:26 - about the opportunities in computer
50:28 - science for high school for you
50:30 - as there are for all of the students in
50:32 - alden
50:33 - but how do you see
50:35 - this moving
50:36 - forward
50:37 - how do you see yourself moving forward
50:42 - um
50:43 - well now
50:45 - i actually
50:47 - added another major to my list of mages
50:50 - that i might want to take in college
50:54 - so
50:56 - yes
50:58 - um
50:59 - i i just see a future for myself in
51:02 - computer science
51:05 - yes it's really fun and i've been
51:07 - enjoying it and
51:10 - it has a lot of opportunities
51:12 - so i'd be willing to
51:14 - go through with it
51:16 - next year or
51:21 - my facial expressions i can't i can't
51:23 - contain myself because i i have been in
51:25 - recruitment
51:26 - um
51:27 - one is better than
51:30 - zero right that's like 100 jump so
51:33 - i applaud you for digging deeper
51:37 - martinius same question
51:40 - um
51:41 - how do you see yourself moving forward
51:44 - from what you've learned
51:46 - from from let's say from you start your
51:48 - self-taught days right when you step
51:51 - started this journey and you're like i
51:52 - just want to dig a little deeper and
51:55 - i'm going to
51:56 - teach myself i'm going to learn
51:59 - and then you made it to blanson and now
52:01 - you're a senior
52:05 - what is next for martinez from
52:07 - everything you've learned in computer
52:09 - science
52:12 - uh next for me would definitely be
52:15 - going a step further you know going to
52:17 - college i've already gotten into my
52:20 - computer science major so i'm going to
52:23 - be
52:24 - going through that and getting all the
52:26 - information that i can i'm still doing
52:29 - udemy courses trying to learn as much as
52:31 - possible
52:32 - and then
52:33 - from there i'm hoping to get an
52:35 - internship sometime in
52:37 - during college and
52:39 - just start my career from there
52:42 - my end goal is definitely trying to
52:43 - become someone who can work separately
52:45 - from others maybe not
52:47 - a big company but being able to create
52:49 - games myself and sharing it with the
52:50 - community
52:52 - that would be my biggest goal but for me
52:54 - every step of the journey is
52:56 - just one path
52:58 - to my end goal so if i have to
53:01 - you know work for a bigger company for a
53:03 - while i'm completely fine with that as
53:05 - long as i'm gaining experience and doing
53:06 - what i love
53:09 - that is wonderful that is wonderful
53:13 - i'm going to expand on that um
53:17 - just a little bit
53:19 - how has computer science how do you
53:22 - think computer science is going to
53:24 - contribute
53:25 - to you
53:27 - personally professionally
53:29 - emotionally
53:31 - and financially
53:32 - in the future
53:34 - um
53:35 - luniqua
53:37 - tell me a little bit more about that
53:38 - what do you think
53:50 - maybe
53:53 - uh
53:54 - that's like probably the first idea
53:56 - that's possible in my head
53:59 - helping you strengthen strengthen your
54:01 - math
54:03 - that's that's a that's a definite start
54:05 - um
54:07 - martinez woody you you just tell us your
54:09 - your future endeavors
54:11 - but how do you think
54:13 - you seem to have a steady head um
54:15 - emotionally how do you do you think that
54:17 - computer science has has helped you in
54:19 - that
54:20 - has assisted you in in your
54:22 - balance i definitely think it has
54:26 - when i think about going through high
54:28 - school i know there was a lot of worry
54:30 - people trying to figure out what they're
54:32 - going to be doing and what the future
54:34 - can hold for them
54:35 - luckily i was able to find my passion
54:37 - early on and i had my gold in mind so
54:41 - emotionally i wasn't as stressed as
54:42 - everyone was trying to figure out what
54:44 - the next step is i was already taking
54:46 - minds and i feel like a large portion of
54:48 - that is thanks to my
54:50 - endeavors in computer science
54:52 - and i guess it works a bit more
54:54 - emotionally as well in terms of if i'm
54:56 - feeling down or i just have nothing to
54:58 - do i can just open up my computer and
55:00 - start working on another project that i
55:02 - found fun or exciting and it'll just
55:04 - perk me right back up
55:08 - okay so i'm gonna ask one more question
55:10 - to each of you and um
55:13 - i'm gonna i want you to just give me
55:15 - your personal opinion on this because
55:18 - we're talking about recruiting more
55:20 - students and teachers
55:22 - what do you feel is missing
55:25 - when it comes to recruiting think about
55:27 - both of your campuses right well all for
55:30 - all of your campuses there's three
55:32 - campuses represented here today but
55:34 - different lenses student lens teacher
55:36 - lens
55:38 - what do you think is missing when it
55:39 - comes to recruiting what is what do you
55:41 - think as a district we need to do
55:44 - and maybe as a campus we need to do
55:46 - to recruit more
55:48 - african-american students into computer
55:50 - science
55:51 - um
55:52 - and what do you think
55:55 - what will be your next step
55:56 - based off of this conversation we're
55:58 - having today
55:59 - so mr banks let me start with you and
56:02 - then i'm gonna go to martinez because
56:03 - you're both at the same campus
56:05 - but i'm curious your
56:07 - thoughts
56:09 - my thoughts is um
56:12 - what we can do to improve or recruit
56:15 - students i think we need to recruit more
56:17 - female students in computer science
56:20 - as i said it's only 15 female
56:23 - we need to
56:24 - work harder to get more student more
56:27 - female students involved
56:29 - and i think if they
56:32 - learn from uh get the word from friends
56:34 - uh
56:36 - and see how much fun they can have and
56:37 - how much how many how many
56:40 - opportunities they can learn from
56:42 - computer science i think that number
56:44 - will skyrocket
56:46 - um
56:48 - as far as myself i try to keep it fun
56:51 - i have a computer program a computer
56:54 - science class and i have a
56:55 - technology class we both have fun
56:58 - i think i'm going to get several
57:00 - students from my technology class in my
57:02 - computer science class because they're
57:04 - having so much fun and the technology
57:07 - they programmed a little bit
57:09 - to get a little bit of everything
57:11 - in the technology class so i'm looking
57:13 - forward to see a lot of them in my
57:14 - programming class next year
57:17 - excellent excellent
57:18 - um
57:19 - miss hammons what about you what do you
57:21 - think the district can do i'm sorry let
57:23 - me go to martinez first martinez what do
57:26 - you think you would want to see the
57:27 - district do or your campus do to record
57:31 - recruit
57:32 - um more
57:33 - students that look like you into those
57:35 - classes
57:38 - okay uh i definitely think that
57:40 - the major kind of
57:42 - decider is the balance between showing
57:44 - them that the class is fun and also that
57:47 - it is some math involved it's hard uh i
57:50 - know that our first year
57:52 - we had a bit of an issue or i would more
57:54 - so the second year the students started
57:56 - finding out that this class isn't all
57:59 - fun you know it's not just making games
58:01 - there's a lot of math involved and it
58:03 - gets pretty difficult it gets pretty
58:05 - rigorous
58:06 - so i think that find the balance between
58:08 - that would be nice i know that uh back
58:11 - when
58:11 - we were still given tours uh as a
58:14 - student ambassador i'd lead the middle
58:16 - school students around our school and
58:17 - give them tours and when we bring them
58:18 - to the classroom
58:20 - i'd have my projects pulled up on my
58:21 - computer but i'd also have on the board
58:24 - there'd be little math problems and
58:27 - little equations on the side just
58:29 - showing them that yes you do get to make
58:31 - these really cool projects and it is
58:34 - really fun
58:35 - but you also have to work hard to solve
58:37 - different problems
58:39 - but i think that maybe showing them that
58:41 - there is some excitement in solving a
58:43 - problem like there's some euphoria once
58:44 - you get that last question correct
58:48 - that can also help bring them just a
58:50 - step closer
58:52 - excellent excellent
58:54 - um miss hammons um
58:57 - tell me how
58:58 - you recruit
59:00 - how do you think the district should
59:02 - recruit
59:04 - so
59:05 - um
59:07 - i think we i think i talked about a
59:09 - little bit about it earlier
59:11 - because of the prereqs i think that we
59:14 - need to do a better job of
59:17 - making sure that we have the
59:19 - representation
59:20 - for our algebra students because
59:23 - math and computer science go hand in
59:26 - hand just like martini has said you
59:28 - cannot do
59:29 - computer science without having a strong
59:32 - math background so i really feel like
59:36 - we need to do
59:37 - a better job of
59:40 - recruiting students to take algebra 1 in
59:43 - the middle school
59:45 - not just looking for those students who
59:48 - are typically represented but really
59:50 - stepping outside the box to find out
59:53 - hey listen
59:56 - your grades may not have always been
59:58 - great in math but i feel like
60:01 - um you're a hard worker let's see if if
60:05 - we put you in this program
60:07 - if you can really
60:09 - [Music]
60:10 - take off in a different level or a
60:13 - different direction than you have
60:15 - previously
60:16 - um i think that
60:20 - and i'm going to take it back to my own
60:22 - experiences in high school
60:25 - i've always been good in math and
60:27 - science
60:28 - my grades did not reflect
60:31 - what i was capable of doing i was a c
60:34 - student
60:36 - i did not take algebra one
60:38 - until
60:39 - later unlike my friends who were really
60:42 - really smart they took algebra early i
60:45 - did not
60:46 - and it wasn't because i couldn't but i
60:48 - didn't have anyone to really push
60:51 - and to say
60:52 - listen you can do this you've got a good
60:55 - strong head on your um shoulders
60:58 - let's see if we can
61:00 - push you
61:01 - push you a little harder so i really
61:03 - think for students like myself who were
61:06 - the middle of
61:08 - the road not your top students not your
61:11 - bottom students but right there in the
61:13 - middle
61:14 - we have to recruit those students those
61:16 - are the students who
61:18 - who are capable of doing computer
61:19 - science and we need to
61:21 - focus our attention and efforts on them
61:24 - if we have any hopes of increasing
61:27 - minorities in computer science and
61:29 - aldine isd
61:31 - i completely agree with you
61:34 - i'm going to add to this on
61:37 - how involved or engaged in the
61:39 - recruiting process are parents and
61:41 - counselors
61:42 - in recruiting students
61:44 - um
61:46 - miss hammonds you're shaking your head
61:47 - so how how how involved are they
61:50 - so i'm just gonna be honest um
61:55 - i'm gonna do my best to phrase this as
61:59 - i'm politically correct as i possibly
62:01 - can
62:05 - our counselors do a wonderful job
62:08 - with scheduling and um it's this time of
62:11 - the year where our counselors are going
62:13 - out they're beating the streets so to
62:16 - speak they're getting our students to
62:17 - sign up and to select courses for next
62:20 - year
62:21 - but they don't know what computer
62:23 - science is
62:24 - so they don't know how and i can't say
62:27 - they don't know
62:28 - i'm not aware that they understand the
62:31 - benefits of computer science so they
62:33 - can't recruit the course they can't push
62:36 - that course like we can
62:38 - because they just
62:40 - you know their job is to get students to
62:42 - sign up for to select courses for the
62:45 - upcoming year but it unless they really
62:48 - have a
62:49 - firm understanding of
62:51 - hey these are some options for you in
62:54 - terms of career choice
62:56 - um and this is how computer science can
62:58 - help
62:59 - lead you and push you
63:01 - then they're just getting students to
63:03 - sign up and i don't want to sound
63:05 - negative because they're doing their job
63:07 - they're doing the best that they can
63:10 - but in terms of recruiting computers
63:12 - minorities and computer science
63:15 - the only way that's going to happen is
63:17 - if we
63:18 - um have
63:21 - uh
63:23 - what's the word i'm looking for i'm
63:25 - going to say
63:26 - remove
63:28 - your initial biases your your
63:30 - you know
63:31 - you only know what you know and if you
63:33 - are unknowing
63:35 - you just assume
63:37 - these are the right students for this
63:38 - class
63:39 - which limits
63:41 - which
63:42 - students take the class
63:44 - so you're right
63:46 - uh providing the insight knowledge uh
63:48 - professional development for counselors
63:51 - is needed in the recruitment of students
63:54 - providing them with the correct
63:55 - resources
63:56 - and um just opportunities for learning
63:59 - what computer science is is
64:02 - absolute key martinis you wanted to jump
64:04 - in and elaborate on what miss hammond
64:06 - was uh was saying
64:12 - uh mute yourself
64:15 - i definitely agree with uh miss
64:17 - hammond's uh overall message and i think
64:20 - it kind of ties back to
64:21 - what we were saying about my definition
64:23 - of minority and the lack of
64:25 - opportunities like she was saying that
64:28 - maybe she wasn't the best in math or she
64:30 - was really good but it wasn't showing
64:32 - and i feel like we place
64:35 - the limitations our place
64:37 - may not necessarily be the limitations
64:40 - required for the class in a sense
64:42 - a student might not show the potential
64:45 - to be
64:46 - someone in the pro computer science
64:47 - field
64:48 - but that might be exactly what they want
64:50 - to pursue i know that transferring from
64:55 - a lot of different places so i went from
64:57 - jamaica to new york from new york to
64:59 - houston uh there were a few times where
65:01 - either my file wasn't found or i had to
65:04 - redo a a grade because it didn't match
65:08 - up with maybe the way that state did it
65:10 - uh in this different place
65:13 - so i found myself either retaking
65:15 - classes just because of requirements
65:17 - that weren't necessarily
65:19 - correct
65:20 - for lack of better term
65:22 - and i think that's definitely something
65:23 - we've seen the computer science field
65:25 - where necessarily
65:27 - maybe algebra one yes it's a good
65:29 - requirement it is something that is
65:31 - required but that might not be something
65:33 - that is shown on file
65:37 - i will say this too i'm just adding a
65:40 - tibit on that
65:42 - that algebra one requirement is
65:46 - is almost a hindrance in computer
65:48 - science now i think it was something
65:50 - that's antiquated that was added
65:52 - a long time ago that has not been
65:54 - removed and we with the exposure of
65:58 - creating a foundational level of of
66:00 - understanding for students
66:02 - for computer science before secondary
66:04 - like before they get to middle school
66:06 - even
66:08 - students who have more insight
66:10 - and maybe learning mathematics through
66:12 - computer science more than
66:14 - in the actual math class they're taking
66:16 - meaning that they're prepared to
66:18 - continue on and that has
66:21 - again not caught up with the current
66:24 - trend um
66:26 - on the state side that
66:28 - that prerequisite is not necessary
66:32 - maybe if it's done in conjunction
66:35 - meaning if you're in algebra one while
66:37 - you're taking this class
66:39 - depending on the course
66:41 - you know maybe that would help
66:44 - with recruitment and having more
66:46 - students
66:47 - of color go into computer science but i
66:51 - i do agree that
66:53 - depending on where you are
66:55 - you you might have to wait until you
66:57 - take it and that's
66:59 - that causes issues if i can't take it
67:01 - because i don't have this math
67:04 - um
67:05 - leniqua
67:06 - how
67:07 - has
67:08 - or how does computer science come up
67:11 - as a choice for next year like how have
67:14 - you seen the next course how have you
67:16 - learned about the next course how are
67:18 - you
67:20 - how are you hearing about this is this
67:22 - from your counselors from your parents
67:24 - from your teachers how have you learned
67:26 - about the computer science pathways
67:30 - um
67:31 - hey last year
67:33 - um i didn't even know computer science
67:35 - was the class
67:37 - oh
67:39 - i i guess now since i'm in the class i'm
67:42 - hearing more about it and
67:44 - the opportunities and the different
67:46 - classes within it that you can take
67:49 - but i don't think there's like much
67:51 - representation of the class when you're
67:54 - in middle school
67:56 - like at all
67:58 - because i didn't know it was a class
67:59 - until this year
68:03 - yeah
68:04 - that too would come from
68:07 - this is new for our district too but
68:09 - that too would come from
68:11 - um preparing making sure that it's
68:13 - prepared with counselors
68:15 - so that it's seen all over and hopefully
68:18 - we see more of that miss hammonds go
68:20 - ahead and add
68:22 - so i just like to say that our
68:24 - counselors don't get a chance to
68:26 - interact every day
68:28 - with the students so they may not be
68:30 - aware
68:31 - of what the students um are capable of
68:35 - doing but we as teachers see them every
68:39 - day every a day every b day so we know
68:42 - that just because their grades don't
68:44 - necessarily reflect
68:47 - um their intellect
68:49 - it doesn't mean that they're not capable
68:51 - of doing it so
68:52 - we as a as teachers have to do a better
68:56 - job of making suggestions
68:58 - to hey
69:00 - to reach out and to work in partnership
69:02 - with the counselors
69:03 - to say that i have the student in my
69:06 - class the grades may not have been
69:08 - the best but i really think that you
69:12 - know that they are capable of doing it
69:14 - and reaching out to the parents to let
69:15 - them know because sometimes they are
69:17 - unaware as well these are some
69:20 - opportunities that the students can get
69:22 - involved with what do you think about it
69:24 - let's try it let's give it give it a go
69:27 - um
69:28 - and
69:30 - if nothing else at least you know
69:33 - whether it's something that you're
69:35 - interested in doing in the future or
69:37 - something that you just want to shy away
69:38 - from
69:40 - absolutely absolutely you guys have been
69:43 - a breath of fresh air
69:45 - and definitely have given me a lot of
69:48 - insight and reflection on how i can
69:51 - further assist this
69:53 - um here in our district and hopefully
69:54 - our conversation helps others all over
69:57 - the the country
69:59 - hopefully
70:00 - you you all agree
70:03 - and um i just want to thank you all for
70:05 - taking this time to on this saturday to
70:07 - spend some time with us
70:09 - and hold this conversation
70:16 - yo
