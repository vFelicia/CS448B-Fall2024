00:11 - I was exposed to coding courses as early
00:14 - as sixth grade so I feel like I use
00:16 - computational thinking every single day
00:18 - it's about being analytical and being
00:20 - able to problem solve too many times
00:22 - students feel like that is for somebody
00:24 - else and not for me we need to change
00:26 - that and we need to uh have students
00:29 - understand that we're not just competing
00:31 - within your own classroom in your own
00:33 - School in your own City you're competing
00:35 - against students all over the world as
00:37 - early as the elementary school it gets
00:39 - students to think about what does it
00:40 - really mean to give commands to a
00:43 - computer to actually do something
00:45 - customized to what they need or want to
00:46 - do uh so we've been strategizing about
00:48 - how to best to do that and finding
00:50 - Partners such as code.org so the
00:52 - computer industry is more than computer
00:55 - programming I mean there are probably
00:57 - thousands of different types of jobs we
00:59 - need some more females in this industry
01:01 - even if they don't end up actually
01:02 - working in computer in the computer
01:05 - science field the skills the way of
01:06 - thinking the problem solving pieces that
01:08 - they learn in those classes they'll be
01:10 - able to use in mathematics and science I
01:13 - actually became a better writer as a
01:15 - result of taking these types of courses
01:17 - because of the ability to be able to
01:19 - translate what's in your mind at a very
01:20 - detailed level for us it's important to
01:22 - be able to provide multiple
01:24 - opportunities for students let's try
01:26 - this out give the opportunity to
01:28 - students and you know what once students
01:30 - are in there and practicing realizing
01:33 - that yeah this is actually something I
01:35 - can do and this could be for
01:36 - me let's let's keep
01:40 - [Music]
01:43 - moving
