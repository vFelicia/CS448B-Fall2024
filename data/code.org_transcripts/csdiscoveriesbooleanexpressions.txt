00:07 - My name is Felicia Williams and I work at Facebook
00:10 - in augmented reality and virtual reality.
00:13 - Augmented reality is
going to really change the way that
00:17 - we think about using computers
00:19 - and it's a really fun place to be right now.
00:23 - Whether you're making an animation an app or a game
00:26 - it's often necessary for your computer program
00:29 - to test a condition to see if it's true or false.
00:33 - To do this we use a boolean expression,
00:35 - an expression that can only evaluate
00:37 - to either true or false.
00:39 - This is similar to asking the computer a yes-or-no question.
00:43 - Let's look at three types of expression
that we can make with comparison operators.
00:49 - Two equal signs compares the
values in each box and asks
00:54 - "Are these two values equal to one another?"
00:56 - The greater than sign compares two values and asks
01:00 - if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
01:04 - And finally the less than sign compares
the two values and asks
01:07 - if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
01:11 - For each comparison we will get either a "true" or "false" answer.
01:16 - For example when playing a game you may get a bonus when you reach a specific score, say 100.
01:23 - To know when to give the bonus
01:24 - the computer will use a boolean
expression that asks
01:27 - "Is the value stored in the variable score equal to 100?"
01:31 - If the expression evaluates to true
01:33 - then you will get a bonus!
01:35 - If it evaluates to false - nothing happens.
01:38 - We can use another comparison operator to make our game even more accurate.
01:43 - In this example the bonus is only given if the player score is exactly 100.
01:49 - But if the player passes 100 they should still get the bonus right?
01:53 - To do this we'll use the boolean expression that asks,
01:56 - "Is the user score greater than 99?"
01:58 - If this is true then the player gets a
bonus.
02:02 - By using boolean expressions to ask true/false questions
02:05 - you can make your animations, apps and games even more
02:09 - dynamic and interactive for your users.
