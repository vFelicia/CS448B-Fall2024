00:03 - good morning everyone happy hour of code
00:07 - happy Thursday we are almost done with
00:09 - Computer Science Education week thank
00:12 - you for choosing to join us this morning
00:15 - we have something very special in store
00:17 - for you of course we're having a guest
00:19 - to talk to us about computer science
00:22 - artificial intelligence and hour of code
00:25 - this year if you have any questions we'd
00:29 - love to hear from you what's on your
00:30 - mind what would you like to know pick
00:33 - our brains uh please go to bitly school
00:37 - question or scan this QR code my name is
00:40 - Tanya Tanya Parker I work at code.org
00:43 - and I help run the hour of code campaign
00:46 - and I'm going to introduce to you our
00:47 - guest who really needs no introduction
00:50 - but he is a tech entrepreneur served as
00:53 - an early advisor and investor at many of
00:55 - tech startups including Facebook Dropbox
00:58 - Airbnb and Uber
01:00 - and in 2013 he and his twin brother Ali
01:02 - founded code.org to create computer
01:04 - science curriculum for K through 12
01:06 - students please join me in welcoming
01:08 - code.org founder and CEO Hadi
01:13 - ptoi welcome Hadi thank you for joining
01:16 - us hi there how are you doing well
01:19 - thanks how are you doing I'm great and
01:22 - hi to the classrooms for joining us uh
01:24 - today on the this uh fourth day of the
01:26 - week of the hour of code and to
01:28 - celebrate Computer Science Education
01:29 - week my voice is a little scratchy I
01:31 - don't actually have a cold uh I've just
01:34 - kind of lost my voice for the last few
01:36 - months um from overusing my voice H but
01:39 - otherwise I'm feeling great thank you so
01:42 - much for joining us despite that and
01:44 - continuing to share your voice and your
01:46 - thoughts um so hotti has a short
01:48 - presentation for us to get started with
01:51 - and we'll have uh some time at the end
01:53 - for Q&A so as you're listening along
01:55 - think about what questions you have save
01:57 - that tell them to your teacher so that
01:59 - they can submit us and tell us and if
02:01 - you're in the zoom chat you can also uh
02:03 - chat with us in zoom and send us your
02:04 - questions I'll hand it off to you Hadi
02:07 - sure well I was going to present some
02:08 - slides about a couple things why I
02:11 - started code.org in the hour of code and
02:14 - why it's important to teach computer
02:15 - science in schools uh as part of
02:18 - basically a basic education for students
02:21 - and a little bit about the future of
02:22 - computer science in an age of artificial
02:25 - intelligence uh let me first just make
02:28 - sure you can actually see my slides
02:31 - Tanya can you see my slides
02:35 - okay I'm just going to assume the answer
02:37 - is yes you can I can all right so uh I
02:42 - start most of my presentations with a
02:44 - story in my own personal story but
02:46 - before I do that I want to talk about uh
02:49 - a different story or really a famous
02:51 - quotation by Steve Jobs the founder of
02:54 - Apple computer and the creator of the
02:56 - iPhone uh and and the iPad and the iMac
02:59 - uh and he's been one of my personal
03:01 - Inspirations for when I started Cod and
03:04 - he uh said a really interesting thing
03:07 - that is really the heart of why I
03:09 - started code.org he said any child any
03:13 - person when you grow up and you learn
03:15 - about the world around you you learn of
03:17 - it as a closed world a world that was
03:20 - built before you a world that doesn't
03:23 - change and people kind of tell you not
03:25 - to try to change too many things don't
03:27 - don't push against things too much don't
03:29 - bash into the walls uh and you know as
03:33 - you grow older your entire life changes
03:35 - when you learn one thing and that's when
03:38 - you learn that everything around you was
03:41 - created by people no different than
03:43 - yourself and that you can change things
03:46 - you can influence things you can help
03:48 - write the story of what the world is
03:50 - going to look like in the future and
03:52 - once you learn that it changes
03:54 - everything in terms of your outlook on
03:56 - life and it turns you into a Creator and
03:59 - that really is the heart of not only why
04:01 - I started code.org to unleash human
04:04 - potential to help every student learn
04:07 - how to create and how to influence and
04:09 - change the world it really is the
04:11 - motivation between behind all of
04:13 - Education which is unleashing human
04:15 - potential uh and this connects a lot to
04:18 - my personal story uh this is a photo of
04:21 - myself and my identical twin brother uh
04:23 - when we were about five years old or
04:25 - four years old I'm the one on the left
04:27 - hand side of this photo uh and when this
04:31 - photo was taken uh we were living in
04:33 - tahan Iran in the Middle East and not
04:36 - long after the photo was taken our
04:37 - country broke into a Islamic revolution
04:41 - and a war broke out with our neighboring
04:43 - country of Iraq it was really a terrible
04:47 - uh place and time to grow up as a child
04:50 - during the day we were living in in fear
04:52 - of the morality police at night we would
04:55 - go into the basements with kerosene
04:56 - lamps while they were bombing our
04:58 - neighborhoods uh and you know in the
05:00 - morning we'd wake up and go to the roof
05:02 - to see whose houses were still standing
05:04 - it it was a really really rough time if
05:06 - you see images now of what's going on in
05:08 - the Middle East in Gaza it was not not
05:11 - very different than that but my life
05:13 - changed dramatically when my father and
05:16 - mother brought home a magical gift for
05:18 - us uh they gave us a computer a
05:21 - Commodore 64 and at the time uh I
05:24 - actually have an example of what this
05:26 - looks like this was the nicest computer
05:29 - you could get it was this big and it had
05:33 - 64 kilobytes of ram this is like an
05:36 - actual cometer 64 believe it or not but
05:39 - that wasn't the magical gift the magical
05:41 - because it didn't have any apps it
05:43 - didn't have any games you could almost
05:45 - do nothing with it uh but the gift was a
05:47 - book an introduction to basic
05:50 - programming and coding and so they're
05:52 - living in a time of revolution in war my
05:54 - escape from the world around me was to
05:56 - learn how to code and I realized that
05:58 - with coding you can bring your own
06:00 - dreams to life you can create things you
06:03 - can create games apps uh and that's how
06:06 - I got my start and when my family came
06:08 - to the United States uh you know we were
06:10 - immigrants we had very little money
06:12 - actually we had no money we didn't have
06:14 - a home we didn't have a car H but what I
06:16 - had was a really good understanding of
06:18 - computer science and so I managed to
06:21 - start working at tech companies when I
06:23 - was 15 years old and I basically have
06:25 - had a a multi-year career in Tech
06:27 - working at some of the greatest
06:29 - companies
06:30 - advising some of the most famous
06:31 - companies in the world starting my own
06:33 - startups and then afterwards uh you know
06:36 - starting code.org and so my story is
06:38 - really a story about opportunity and the
06:40 - American dream and part of the reason I
06:43 - started code.org is because the world of
06:45 - opportunity and the future of work is
06:48 - changing and most kids going through the
06:50 - education system and school system and
06:52 - graduating don't have the same chances I
06:55 - did because of school not Preparing
06:57 - People for the future and I want to talk
07:00 - a little bit about what the future is
07:02 - looking like uh and that future is
07:04 - coming very quickly and this is
07:07 - especially relevant for people if you
07:08 - think about the jobs that most Americans
07:11 - end up in if you look at uh people
07:14 - working in stores people driving trucks
07:17 - people working in manufacturing people
07:19 - working in food prep that's roughly half
07:21 - of the jobs in our country uh and
07:25 - meanwhile there are robots that already
07:28 - know how to flip Burgers there are
07:30 - robots that already know how to make
07:32 - salads a lot of food preparation like
07:35 - chopping carrots or or slicing onions is
07:38 - now at the point where robots can do it
07:40 - and that's not just the future it's
07:42 - today there's already cars that know how
07:44 - to drive themselves without a human
07:46 - driver and that's soon going to mean
07:48 - that the job of a truck driver can be
07:50 - done by a robot that's driving the truck
07:53 - in fact not in the future but today
07:56 - there are tractors that can help Farm
07:59 - without an actual farmer here's a
08:01 - tractor that's basically farming the
08:03 - land and nobody's even driving it and
08:06 - speaking of farming there's now robots
08:09 - that know how to pick strawberries
08:10 - there's robots that know how to pick
08:12 - tomatoes uh these are again some of the
08:15 - most common jobs in our country and the
08:17 - food you eat is increasingly not being
08:19 - prepared by humans or or even grown by
08:22 - humans it's being done by robots uh if
08:24 - any of you in school has have used 3D
08:27 - printing another thing that's coming
08:29 - this isn't really in in use at scale is
08:32 - homes that are 3D printed this is an
08:35 - entire house that's being built by a 3D
08:37 - printer there's no humans building this
08:39 - home there's no construction workers
08:41 - it's just a robot laying cement uh and
08:44 - and you know putting a home together now
08:47 - You' think that these types of robotic
08:49 - things are going to change manual work
08:51 - the work that people do with their hands
08:53 - but actually the fastest type of work
08:55 - that's changing is desk work or digital
08:58 - work for for example the work of a
09:00 - radiologist uh you know somebody who
09:03 - looks at x-rays to look for diseases uh
09:07 - you know a few years ago algorithms got
09:10 - to the point where they could do a
09:11 - better job than humans at detecting
09:14 - diseases and people said well the
09:16 - algorithm is going to detect the disease
09:18 - but you still need a human to explain
09:21 - what's going on uh and then in the last
09:23 - few months the same folks that created
09:25 - chat GPT created an AI that even
09:28 - explains what going on in the in the
09:31 - X-ray so really a lot of the work that
09:33 - the radiologist is doing is being done
09:35 - by Ai and this is going to have this
09:37 - type of impact is going to have great
09:39 - impacts in medicine but also in Creative
09:42 - Fields like in Art here's an example of
09:45 - art that wasn't created by a human it
09:47 - was created by a computer here's art
09:49 - that won a national uh prize but the
09:53 - artist wasn't human it was an
09:55 - AI um there's another type of job that's
09:58 - going to be changing when I was growing
10:00 - up everybody the sort of favorite job
10:02 - among kids was to one day be an
10:05 - astronaut these days if you ask kids the
10:07 - job they most aspire to be it's to
10:09 - become an influencer uh which itself is
10:11 - just a sad story uh but that's not going
10:15 - to be as easy because even being an
10:18 - influencer is changing this here is an
10:20 - influencer on social media who's not a
10:23 - real human being uh he or she is
10:26 - actually a digital creation of AI it's
10:29 - not an actual human it's just an
10:30 - imaginary virtual influencer and
10:33 - increasingly on social media and soon
10:35 - even in in magazines and movies we're
10:38 - going to see people who are not people
10:40 - but they are just virtual and then
10:42 - lastly almost all of desk work is
10:45 - increasingly being impacted by
10:47 - technology if you've used chat GPT or
10:50 - Google's Bard or Microsoft's co-pilot
10:53 - these generative AI tools can already do
10:55 - things like write a 1,000w essay about
10:58 - the French Revolution or create a
11:01 - presentation or a lesson plan that
11:03 - explains photosynthesis or to write a
11:06 - short story and you tell it what you
11:07 - want in the story and the AI will create
11:09 - the story for you or if you like coding
11:13 - you can tell AI to design the user
11:15 - interface for an app and then to write
11:17 - the code for it uh and there's many many
11:20 - more possibilities and this is
11:21 - technology that's changing all the time
11:24 - and so as you think about what is
11:26 - already available today and what what
11:27 - things are going to look like in the 10
11:29 - next 10 years there's many questions
11:31 - that this brings up lots of people are
11:34 - asking about Technology's impact on work
11:37 - but since we're talking about education
11:39 - in school there's a more fundamental
11:41 - question young for younger people and
11:43 - for teachers which is what is the role
11:45 - of Education in an age of artificial
11:48 - intelligence what is the job that
11:49 - teachers and schools should do and what
11:52 - should students learn now at code.org we
11:54 - believe that AI artificial intelligence
11:58 - and computer science should be
11:59 - foundational parts of basic education
12:02 - changing what we teach students you know
12:05 - right now every student learns how the
12:07 - digestive system works in biology they
12:10 - learn a bit how about how light bulbs
12:12 - and electricity work every student
12:14 - learns about math and in the future
12:17 - every student or not in the future
12:18 - starting now to prepare for the future
12:21 - every student should also learn what an
12:23 - algorithm is or how the internet works
12:25 - or how artificial intelligence is
12:27 - changing Society and we should learn
12:30 - these things not just to learn how the
12:32 - world works but also because of the
12:34 - thing I said at the very beginning of my
12:35 - talk about helping children unleash
12:38 - their human potential and their
12:40 - creativity and to learn that they can
12:42 - change the world because when you learn
12:44 - computer science you can learn by
12:46 - Elementary School that you can create
12:47 - beautiful art using Code by Middle
12:50 - School you can learn how to create games
12:52 - instead of just playing games on your
12:54 - phone and by high school you can create
12:56 - apps and learning creativity is is
12:58 - really one of the most important aspects
13:00 - of Education um this isn't just sort of
13:03 - an idea it's something that now hundreds
13:06 - of millions of students have been doing
13:08 - uh we've had so many amazing stories
13:10 - about students on code.org like this kid
13:13 - dowy manigot who built an app to help
13:15 - domestic abuse victims call for help or
13:18 - Safi saani who helped when the pandemic
13:21 - started she created an app to find out
13:23 - which restaurants were open or Spencer
13:25 - Applegate uh who lives in a one of the
13:28 - poorest towns in Kentucky and he
13:30 - recreated the billion dooll game of
13:32 - Tetris on code.org or Katie Clemens in
13:35 - Missouri who created an app to help her
13:37 - friends diagnose their own mental health
13:39 - these are just examples of over 100
13:42 - million students who've used code.org to
13:45 - create but the problem is that most
13:47 - schools don't teach computer science
13:49 - those of you who are joining this call
13:51 - right now you're among the lucky few
13:52 - schools who do teach computer science
13:55 - but this is something that collectively
13:57 - thanks to the passion of millions of
13:59 - teachers we are changing the education
14:02 - system there's now over 80 million
14:05 - students learning on code.org right now
14:07 - and of them almost half are young women
14:10 - half are from black Latino or other
14:12 - underrepresented backgrounds racially or
14:14 - ethnically almost half or lowincome and
14:17 - collectively they've created over over
14:20 - 250 million projects almost a quarter of
14:23 - a billion projects created by the
14:25 - students on code.org um so this is
14:27 - really an amazing
14:29 - Global movement you know there are more
14:31 - students on code.org than there are in
14:33 - the entire United States and to end my
14:36 - presentation I just wanted to say a
14:38 - thank you to all of the teachers all
14:40 - around the world who have helped bring
14:42 - computer science to their classrooms to
14:44 - help us change the world of
14:47 - Education my life would have been
14:49 - incredibly different if I didn't have
14:51 - the basic understanding of computer
14:53 - science and if I think about the all the
14:56 - kids in the world what would the world
14:58 - look like if every student had the same
15:00 - access that I had growing up or that
15:03 - dowy manigat or Sophie SA johni or
15:07 - Spencer Parker or Katie Clemens had what
15:10 - would the world look like uh and to
15:12 - answer that question I have a very short
15:14 - video from students on code.org that I
15:17 - wanted to play for
15:21 - you the world has some big problems but
15:24 - I'm little what can I do even when
15:27 - problems seem big we can tackle them one
15:30 - step at a time our generation can help
15:32 - make a more prosperous Equitable and
15:34 - sustainable world I'm warning to code
15:37 - I'm designing apps that solve local
15:39 - problems I'm programming robots I'm
15:42 - learning computer science to make change
15:44 - happen because with technology we could
15:47 - build robots to clean World oceans we
15:50 - can program drones to detect forest
15:51 - fires quickly we can empow young women
15:54 - with digital skills and tools we can
15:57 - program mobile apps to streamline
15:59 - farming in cor rural areas we can use
16:01 - genan sequencing to diagnose diseases
16:03 - and create personalized medicine to cure
16:05 - them I'm little but don't look at my
16:07 - size look at my potential I can make
16:10 - change happen I can make change happen I
16:13 - can make change happen I can make change
16:15 - [Music]
16:20 - happen thank you very much and happy
16:23 - Computer Science Education
16:26 - week thank you so much for sharing that
16:28 - hottie um I just wanted to also invite a
16:32 - few of the attendees here in this call
16:35 - if you are uh interested in coming on
16:38 - camera and having uh become I'm going to
16:40 - promote you as a panelist so that you
16:42 - can ask some of your questions live say
16:44 - hi to hottie here do chat me if you're
16:47 - interested and I will bring you up on
16:49 - screen I'll give you a few minutes to
16:51 - prepare if you'd like um just to get
16:53 - started we had some follow-up questions
16:55 - on your presentation so um when you
16:58 - mention mentioned the robots that are
17:00 - taking over in farming for example or
17:03 - automated driving uh do you think that
17:06 - AI technology will replace these jobs
17:09 - because there aren't people in these
17:10 - jobs
17:13 - anymore so your question is is AI gonna
17:16 - take away people's jobs or replace jobs
17:19 - um there are some cases where AI is
17:22 - going to replace jobs uh but much more
17:26 - commonly jobs are going to be taken by
17:30 - people who know how to use AI people who
17:32 - know how to use AI are going to take
17:34 - jobs away from people who don't know how
17:36 - to use AI uh artificial intelligence is
17:39 - quickly becoming one of the most
17:41 - powerful tools and giving people
17:43 - superpowers and people who know how to
17:45 - use that superpower are going to be
17:47 - among the most valuable people in the
17:49 - workplace that's part of why uh it's
17:51 - important to to teach this as part of
17:57 - Education
17:59 - Tanya you're on mute and also miss
18:01 - Garner wanted to yes I'm going to I do
18:03 - have a classroom here we're going to
18:05 - show here as a panelist Miss Garner
18:07 - please
18:09 - welcome um hopefully you saw that
18:13 - invitation and we'll see you joining
18:15 - here in a
18:16 - second um another question while she
18:19 - gets set up here so somewhat related to
18:22 - that follow up will robots and
18:23 - artificial intelligence take over the
18:25 - world um will robots and artificial
18:30 - intelligence take over the world hi kids
18:32 - it's great to see you
18:34 - hello um well I would say since the
18:37 - beginning of time technology not the
18:40 - beginning of time but since humans have
18:42 - since the beginning of humans existence
18:44 - on this planet our technology has been
18:46 - taking over the world that if you look
18:49 - at today's world it is very very
18:51 - different than what it looked like
18:53 - before humans were around uh the things
18:56 - we learn how to build are taking over
18:58 - the world
18:59 - cars are everywhere before we had cars
19:03 - nobody imagined these robotic things
19:05 - driving around on Wheels um and you know
19:08 - phones almost everybody every adult uh
19:12 - increasingly has a smartphone that does
19:15 - these amazing things and smartphones you
19:18 - could say are also taking over the world
19:20 - so the technology we build is taking
19:23 - over the world and the newer versions
19:25 - whether it's the things adults create or
19:27 - the things that children like the ones
19:29 - in Miss Garner's class right now what
19:31 - you create when you create technology
19:33 - you can get to change the world that was
19:35 - it taking over the world I don't know
19:38 - about that but we're changing our world
19:40 - that's what humans
19:42 - do thank you Miss gner we have a second
19:44 - grade classroom here in Illinois thank
19:46 - you so much for joining us hi what's
19:48 - your
19:50 - name oh a little bit louder can you say
19:53 - one more
19:54 - time oh nice to meet you do you have a
19:57 - question for hottie her name is Yas me
20:00 - Yas me nice to meet you nice and close
20:02 - honey there you go okay ask our
20:08 - question what you
20:11 - recommend students for
20:15 - students our our age we're starting code
20:19 - we're starting
20:22 - code hi yasm I love your question and by
20:25 - the way my uh son Mazy is in fourth
20:29 - grade so he's only a couple two years
20:32 - older than you at and in fact when I
20:35 - created code.org uh my daughter Sophia
20:39 - was your age uh and so a lot of the
20:41 - things I put inside code.org were
20:44 - because of my own kids and seeing what
20:46 - would they enjoy playing with uh now
20:48 - what would I recommend for a second
20:50 - grader who wants to learn code I I would
20:54 - recommend trying the activities on
20:55 - code.org the ones that I think are the
20:57 - most most fun the Flappy Bird activity
21:00 - if you haven't tried that is one of the
21:02 - most fun things we made we love that
21:05 - everybody give a big thumbs
21:09 - up do you know how Flappy Bird on
21:12 - code.org was created uh Flappy Bird 10
21:16 - years ago was a game that a a young boy
21:19 - in Vietnam created Flappy Bird and it
21:23 - went viral all around the world
21:25 - everybody was playing this game on their
21:27 - phones and this was like a teenager who
21:29 - had made it uh and he got so overwhelmed
21:33 - that people with people with the
21:34 - popularity of the game that he made that
21:37 - it he got kind of scared and he
21:38 - basically erased it and got rid of it
21:40 - and so for a week everybody in the world
21:42 - was playing Flappy Bird and then it
21:44 - disappeared you couldn't download it
21:46 - anymore it didn't exist uh and my team
21:48 - at c.org had been playing it and we were
21:51 - enjoying it and we said why don't we
21:52 - make a coding activity for every student
21:54 - to make their own Floppy Bird so that
21:56 - everybody could uh make a game just like
21:59 - that boy in Vietnam had made uh and it's
22:02 - something we made in about three or four
22:04 - days a guy named Brent on our team put
22:07 - it together and uh in 10 years it hasn't
22:10 - lost its popularity it's among my
22:12 - favorite things and everybody's favorite
22:14 - things besides Flappy Bird I would
22:16 - suggest you try our dance party activity
22:19 - uh dance party with AI is something we
22:21 - just put out with artificial
22:23 - intelligence and it lets you learn how
22:24 - to code a dance and then you can also
22:27 - dance your own dance
22:28 - after you write the code for it and
22:31 - that's also super
22:33 - fun thank you so much did you say thank
22:37 - you thank you all right we are loving we
22:41 - are loving code.org so much they were so
22:44 - excited when they came in today they
22:46 - said are we gonna play that flat paper
22:48 - game again and I said yes we are so they
22:51 - are super excited and I did show them
22:53 - dance Pary so that's our next job we're
22:55 - gonna do so we're doing exactly what he
22:58 - would he recommends us to do great job
23:03 - everybody do you have someone else in
23:05 - your class with another question thank
23:07 - you yes
23:08 - Meine ask a question come
23:15 - up
23:21 - okay what's your name
23:25 - Naomi hi
23:26 - Naomi
23:30 - do you want to ask your
23:32 - question um do people control the
23:37 - robots right now almost all the robots
23:40 - that that are made are controlled by
23:42 - humans in some way but sometimes they
23:45 - control it every move it makes but more
23:49 - often they use code just like you're
23:52 - learning to code what the robot's going
23:54 - to do and then they hit the Run button
23:57 - and then the robot but then does its
23:58 - thing so for example if you looked at
24:00 - that tractor that was farming there's
24:03 - not a there's not somebody controlling
24:05 - it like you know like a Xbox controller
24:08 - moving around where's the tractor GNA go
24:10 - what they do is they write code for that
24:12 - tractor just like the code you write on
24:15 - code.org they'll say move turn left move
24:17 - forward you know don't don't go into
24:19 - somebody else's farm and the tractor's
24:21 - going around in circles or or in rows
24:24 - whether it's going back and forth or
24:26 - however it wants to go the path that the
24:28 - tractor is taking is coded by somebody
24:31 - so you could say that that person is
24:32 - controlling the robot but they're not
24:34 - controlling it with their hands they're
24:37 - controlling it with their code and
24:39 - that's part of the reason why it's
24:40 - important to learn computer science and
24:44 - coding a great question thank you
24:47 - naie okay um n did you want to ask a
24:50 - question or should I let Mor
24:53 - go why don't you come on up and you can
24:56 - think
24:59 - hi hi what's your name moram hi
25:05 - moram I have a question um do you like
25:08 - Ninja Turtles or or Mario
25:12 - Bros that's a very important question um
25:17 - I don't know whether you're asking
25:18 - whether I personally do it or whether
25:19 - code.org does it uh I haven't done Ninja
25:23 - Turtles but I have done Mario Bros but
25:27 - uh code.org we don't have the ability to
25:30 - bring every type of game or character or
25:33 - movie into our uh learning platform we
25:35 - have to pick the ones that we think are
25:37 - going to be the most fun uh so every
25:39 - year we do something new so we might do
25:41 - that in the future the other thing is we
25:44 - can't just do whoever we want we need to
25:45 - get their permission so for example for
25:48 - us to make a code.org activity with Star
25:51 - Wars we have to go to the people who
25:53 - make Star Wars which is
25:55 - lucasfilm and Lucas film is part of
25:57 - Disney and getting their permission was
25:59 - really really really really hard uh it
26:02 - took one year of asking until we got the
26:04 - permission to use Star Wars uh every
26:07 - time where you have sort of a cool thing
26:10 - from games or movies inside code.org it
26:12 - takes almost a year of asking permission
26:15 - and working with whoever created that
26:17 - game or created that movie just to get
26:20 - it's not just to get the permission they
26:21 - want to make sure that the way we show
26:24 - their game inside code.org
26:26 - feels right it feels like it was made
26:29 - correctly so for example I want to bring
26:32 - the Marvel Universe into code.org but
26:35 - it's really important for the people at
26:37 - Marvel that it feels legit like it feels
26:41 - part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
26:43 - and doesn't feel like you're leaving
26:45 - like the Marvel characters are leaving
26:47 - their universe and doing something that
26:49 - doesn't belong uh so getting permission
26:51 - to do these things is not easy H I don't
26:54 - know whether we'll have Ninja Turtles
26:55 - anytime
26:56 - soon
26:58 - and we do have a um wakanda forever sort
27:02 - of black panther activity on arco.com
27:05 - and Miss Gardner I can send that to you
27:07 - later that's not made by code.org but
27:09 - one of our many uh activity providers
27:12 - who also helped create new tutorial so
27:15 - hey maybe we will do Marvel soon that'd
27:16 - be kind of cool thank you for your
27:19 - question thank you m you're welcome okay
27:23 - next one more yeah let's do a okay
27:26 - beautiful hi
27:28 - hi hi what's your name Nea Neda where
27:33 - are you
27:34 - from
27:36 - Palin that's
27:40 - wonderful what's your question does
27:43 - robot control
27:46 - theirselves that's a great question do
27:48 - robots control themselves that's one of
27:51 - the hardest questions that computer
27:53 - scientists are thinking about whether
27:54 - it's even possible and what does it mean
27:57 - for for robots or code or technology to
28:00 - control itself and what do it you know
28:04 - what that really begs the question of
28:06 - for a robot or technology to control
28:08 - itself it needs to even know that it is
28:12 - itself to have a sense that it exists to
28:15 - be conscious like when you move your
28:17 - hand you know this is my hand nobody's
28:20 - telling you Neta move your hand you
28:23 - decide I want to move my hand and you
28:25 - know that I am me and I want cake or I
28:29 - want to play Super Mario Bros you know
28:32 - you have your own desires your wants
28:34 - your own needs and you can use your
28:36 - hands and your brain to do what you want
28:38 - and that's what gives you control over
28:40 - yourself we have no idea yet how to do
28:43 - that inside code or inside a robot so
28:46 - right now there's no robot or technology
28:50 - that even knows that it exists let
28:53 - alone having wants and needs or the
28:56 - ability to control control itself what
28:58 - the what we can do right now is make
29:00 - robots that look like they're that they
29:02 - know they exist they seem to want to do
29:05 - things and in fact you can talk to to
29:08 - computers and the computer might tell
29:10 - you I know I'm a computer I am alive you
29:14 - know I want to do things but does it
29:16 - actually know that it's a computer or
29:18 - does it is it just telling you something
29:19 - that somebody else coded it to do right
29:22 - now the robots and computers don't even
29:25 - know that they exist and they don't even
29:27 - really know what that means they don't
29:28 - have a sense of desire to do anything
29:30 - they only do what we code them to do uh
29:33 - once the robots know that they exists
29:35 - and actually have their own desires or
29:38 - wants and needs to control things the
29:40 - world is going to be very very different
29:42 - but that uh most people don't think
29:45 - that's going to happen for many many
29:46 - decades so tens 10 20 30 years so you
29:50 - might be 40 years old when that happens
29:53 - or even
29:54 - older wow thank you for your question it
29:58 - was great to meet you we could take one
30:00 - last question who'd like to come
30:05 - up hi what's your name my name is
30:10 - Elias nice to meet you Elias what's your
30:14 - question um so how do
30:17 - robots control
30:20 - themselves Well robots don't control
30:23 - themselves but as I answered when Naomi
30:25 - asked about this programmers Like You by
30:29 - writing code can control robots so next
30:33 - activity you do with Miss Garner coding
30:35 - on code.org imagine that you're writing
30:38 - code to control a robot what you see on
30:40 - the screen might just be a Flappy Bird
30:43 - it might be something else but the same
30:45 - code that you write is how people can
30:47 - code robots people like you writing code
30:50 - are the ones that are controlling the
30:53 - robots wow that's amazing isn't that
30:56 - amazing yeah
30:59 - what do we
31:03 - say thank you Miss Garner's class and
31:05 - thank you students for asking your
31:07 - wonderful questions we're so glad you
31:09 - could join
31:11 - us uh so as hotti mention and it looks
31:14 - like Miss Gardner's class is going to do
31:16 - I'm going to show you if you haven't
31:17 - seen it yet uh go to code.org
31:21 - Dan this is code.org newest hour of code
31:24 - activity that we launched last week than
31:27 - dance party AI Edition so if you've
31:29 - already dance done dance party before in
31:31 - a previous AR of code this one's new
31:33 - we're going to use um artificial
31:35 - intelligence and learn about generative
31:37 - AI to create fancy backgrounds that are
31:42 - generated by the AI bot based on some
31:45 - emojis that you choose um and you get to
31:47 - use songs from some of the top artists
31:50 - of today like mile Cyrus Lady Gaga
31:52 - Little Nas X BTS so hopefully you find a
31:56 - song that you really enjoy make your own
31:59 - dance party with your characters dancing
32:01 - to that song and you get to use AI to
32:03 - create a fun video for your dance so
32:06 - check it out and I'd love to see all of
32:09 - your dance parties if you have
32:11 - permission from your parents or your
32:13 - teacher uh please post on social media
32:15 - tag us with hash hour of code uh and I'd
32:19 - love to see your dance moves let's give
32:21 - a big round of applause to hottie thank
32:23 - you so much for joining us and for
32:25 - sharing your insights and thank you
32:27 - again to miss Garner and all of our
32:28 - viewers for joining us happy hour of
32:32 - code oh hi you're muted one more also
32:36 - thank you to miss Conor and Miss Ryman
32:38 - and the other teachers who signed off in
32:40 - the last minute or
32:42 - so thank you
32:45 - enjoy bye bye
