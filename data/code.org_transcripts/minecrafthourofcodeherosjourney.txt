00:00 - Stacy: Stampy, Lizzy, Preston - thank you for coming
with me.
00:04 - What I want to show you is just over this
mesa plateau.
00:07 - I think you're going to love it!
00:09 - WAIT A MINUTE THERES A HOLE IN THE TRACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(screaming) Is everyone okay?
00:16 - Stampy: Ah, I see the problem.
00:18 - Look!
00:19 - There was a hole in the track.
00:20 - Stacy: Really, Stampy?
00:22 - Lizzy: Maybe we should gather blocks to fix
it.
00:24 - Preston: Let's make it a race.
00:26 - First one back to the top wins.
00:27 - Stacy: Ok, on your mark, get set, GO!
00:30 - Ok, I'm just gonna gather some of this terracotta.
00:34 - Wait.
00:35 - Guys, I can't mine!
00:36 - Preston: Same.
00:37 - Lizzy: I can't either.
00:38 - Stacy: Ok, that is really strange.
00:40 - Stampy, can you mine?
00:41 - Stampy: I can't mine!
00:42 - Stacy: Ok, everyone stay calm.
00:44 - Stampy: Is the game broken?
00:45 - Stacy: If it is, how do we fix it?
00:47 - Lizzy: I don't know.
00:48 - Stampy: Does anyone know how to write Minecraft
code?
00:51 - (poof) Preston: What is that?
00:53 - Stampy: I've never seen one of these before.
00:55 - Lizzy: It's so adorable!
00:56 - Stacy: Is it...is it tameable?
00:58 - Preston: Okay, what is going on?
01:01 - Someone needs to go back to the real world
and fix this.
01:04 - All: Not it!
01:05 - Stacy: Not i- (Sigh.)
01:07 - Ok, I'll go.
01:11 - Hey!
01:12 - Oh, okay, hey, so I'm in the real world now.
01:16 - I'm going to go try to find the Minecraft offices.
01:19 - But, I'm going to need your help.
01:21 - Start doing the tutorial, start learning how
to code, and I'll catch up with you guys after
01:25 - a few levels, okay?
01:27 - Wish me luck!
01:30 - I think it's this way.
01:33 - Ow!
01:34 - Cactus!
01:35 - I'm okay!
01:37 - To complete the Hour of Code challenge, you'll
need to write code to program the agent.
01:42 - You'll work together with The Agent to clear
any obstacles in your path, so you can pick
01:47 - up the items you'll need for your journey.
01:50 - Only the Agent can place and break blocks,
and only you can collect items.
01:55 - Your screen is split into three main parts.
On the left is Minecraft.
02:00 - The middle area is the toolbox with commands
that the Agent can understand.
02:05 - And on the right, is the workspace.
02:08 - That's where you stack the commands to build
your program to control the Agent.
02:12 - The Agent can walk, turn, and activate pressure
plates.
02:16 - It can also destroy blocks and place blocks.
02:19 - When it places the block like these minecart
rails, it places it underneath itself.
02:24 - If you forget what to do, the instructions
for each level are at the top.
02:28 - If you want to try again, you can hit the
blue "reset" button to reset everything to
02:33 - where it started.
02:35 - And if you need to delete a block of code,
drag it from your workspace to the toolbox.
02:39 - Remember to hit "run" to get the Agent moving.
02:42 - Okay, go ahead and try out the first few levels.
02:44 - Good luck!
