00:06 - let's take another look at your big game
00:09 - last time you animated the target and
00:12 - danger sprites to move across the screen
00:14 - but when they left the screen they never
00:16 - came back we're going to use boolean to
00:19 - bring them back to the screen so they
00:21 - move across the screen repeatedly in the
00:24 - last stage you learned how to keep Sam
00:26 - the bat from leaving his backyard by
00:28 - using a boolean to check if he was safe
00:30 - left and safe right now you're going to
00:34 - add the same functionality to your video
00:36 - game each time your target in danger
00:39 - moves the video game engine will send
00:41 - their x-coordinate to the on-screen
00:43 - function if a screen ever returns false
00:47 - that means the sprite has gone off the
00:49 - screen and the engine will take care of
00:51 - resetting it to the opposite side just
00:54 - like you did with Sam out of the bag
00:55 - you'll want to first complete the safe
00:57 - left and save right functions before
01:00 - combining them both in on screen
