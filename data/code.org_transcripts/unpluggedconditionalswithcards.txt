00:05 - This lesson is called conditionals with cards.
Every day you make decisions based on what
00:12 - you see and hear. I want to walk to the park
but first I have to decide if I should
00:19 - bring an umbrella or not. So I look out the
window. If it's cloudy, I'm going to take
00:24 - my umbrella. Else, I'll take some sunglasses.
I think I'd better take the umbrella. What
00:30 - I see and hear determines what I take to the
park. Conditionals are used in games too.
00:36 - Today we're going to practice using conditionals
with a card game. In this game, the card that
00:40 - I draw determines what my friends are going
to do. If I draw a seven, everyone claps.
00:50 - Else, everyone says "awww." Let's try it!
I bet you can make up games
01:03 - that are even more fun with conditionals.
Give it a try! Conditionals are what make
01:08 - computers seem smart. A computer program that
includes conditionals can react to the user
01:14 - and change its course of action. Think about
your favorite video game. Do you earn more
01:20 - points for some actions than you do for others?
This occurs because the computer is using
01:26 - conditionals. It's the way a computer makes
a decision. How about, if you hit the target,
01:34 - you earn ten points. Else, you lose three.
When you know how conditionals work, you can
01:40 - create all kinds of exciting games.
