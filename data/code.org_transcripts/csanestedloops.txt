00:10 - my name is pan and i am a software
00:12 - engineer at xbox there's always multiple
00:14 - ways to tackle a problem and i think
00:16 - part of what we do in learning more is
00:19 - learning just how to tackle those
00:21 - problems more efficiently by using what
00:24 - other people have figured out before us
00:25 - but also we can maybe we'll come up with
00:27 - something better we don't know give it
00:30 - time
00:31 - let's say we are building a brick wall
00:34 - we start by laying a single book
00:37 - laying one book at a time is this type
00:39 - of loop
00:40 - if we repeat this action five times we
00:43 - get a row of books
00:46 - laying a row of books can also be a loop
00:50 - the placing of each individual book is
00:52 - an inner loop
00:55 - and the placing of an entire row of
00:57 - books is an outer loop
01:00 - after the outer loop executes five times
01:03 - we have a brick wall
01:05 - this is an example of a nested loop a
01:09 - nested loop is a loop that exists inside
01:12 - the body of another loop
01:14 - let's see how this would look using for
01:16 - loops
01:17 - let's start with the outer loop
01:19 - our wall needs to have five rows of
01:21 - books
01:22 - we write the outer loop just don't have
01:24 - one
01:26 - and stop when we complete the fifth row
01:30 - then we will increase those by one
01:34 - for each row of the wall we need to lay
01:36 - five books
01:37 - revise the inner loop just stir that one
01:42 - and stop when we have made the fifth
01:44 - brick
01:46 - we will increase brick by one
01:49 - inside the body of the loop we can add a
01:52 - print statement
01:54 - to tell us what row we are on
01:58 - and how many books we have made in that
02:00 - row so far
02:03 - when we run this code we see each book
02:05 - displayed for the first row
02:09 - then we go to the next row and we see
02:11 - each book displayed for the second row
02:16 - and so forth until we complete the fifth
02:18 - row
02:21 - nested loops are good for performing
02:24 - repetitive actions like when robots work
02:26 - on an assembly line
