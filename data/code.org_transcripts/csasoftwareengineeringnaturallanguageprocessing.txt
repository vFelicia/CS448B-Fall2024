00:10 - my name is jakov i'm a senior machine
00:12 - learning engineering manager at spotify
00:14 - i teach machines how to understand
00:16 - humans
00:17 - natural language processing is used in
00:19 - almost
00:20 - all
00:21 - corners of spotify there are two things
00:23 - natural language processing and natural
00:24 - language understanding both of them
00:26 - involve using computers that we teach
00:29 - algorithms to extract information from
00:32 - language or to produce language
00:35 - we can look at what billions of other
00:37 - people have called playlists and titled
00:39 - their favorite sets of songs then
00:42 - extract relationships between words
00:44 - automatically and learn that when you
00:47 - say this you're looking for these kinds
00:48 - of songs just by analyzing the language
00:51 - other people have used to describe them
00:53 - [Music]
00:54 - the famous spotify recommendation
00:55 - algorithm right that powers a lot of our
00:58 - personalization experience is applying
01:01 - natural language processing algorithms
01:03 - to just the sequence of songs in a
01:05 - playlist we treat songs and playlists
01:08 - like words and sentences and we learn
01:10 - the language of music and musical
01:12 - expression and then we speak that
01:14 - language back to you when we personalize
01:16 - your listening experience
01:18 - by understanding the contents of the
01:20 - podcast and then searching within them
01:23 - we can really enhance your experience so
01:25 - that we're getting you the niche content
01:26 - that's perfect for you in the moment
01:29 - it's used to both enable the core
01:31 - experience and enhance it by making it
01:33 - personalized and much more contextual
01:35 - for our users
01:37 - so the natural language processing
01:39 - systems we built today they have
01:41 - billions of parameters they're
01:42 - incredibly complex but then you just set
01:45 - them up
01:46 - you feed them the data
01:48 - they train for a few days and then
01:50 - they just work in five to ten years i
01:53 - think everyone working in the software
01:54 - engineering field will be touching
01:56 - natural language processing in some way
01:58 - shape or form this is becoming the main
02:00 - modality of interaction to software and
02:02 - computer systems right it's a uniquely
02:04 - human trait language and so whenever
02:06 - you're working with natural language
02:07 - processing you're doing something that
02:08 - really touches the most human thing
02:10 - there is it often feels like you're
02:12 - working with magic
02:14 - [Music]
02:23 - you
