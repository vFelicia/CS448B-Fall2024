00:19 - This lesson is called For Loop Fun. In this
lesson, we'll use a number line to play a dice game.
00:26 - Each player will roll three times
to assign a starting value,
00:30 - a stopping value, and our interval.
00:33 - During each turn, we circle
our starting value, and every value that is
00:37 - the same number of steps forward as our interval
value.
00:41 - We stop circling when we get to our stopping value.
00:45 - The person with the highest
score wins!
00:47 - For loops can come in handy in a lot of places.
00:51 - If you were a
meteorologist, you would use for loops all the time.
01:03 - Hi, I'm Becky. I work at Able Driller
Renewables as a wind meteorologist.
01:12 - I forecast wind speeds for the Columbia River Gorge area, where the company owns wind farms.
01:19 - We're trying to understand how much wind is going to be there,
01:23 - so that we know how much power is going to be outputted.
01:27 - We give that information to real time energy traders. They buy and sell power,
01:32 - based on how much power we tell
them is going to be there, in order to make sure
01:36 - the power grid is balanced, your lights stay on,
01:39 - and that we maximize energy we get out of our wind farms.
01:47 - We're at the national control center for Eber Troller Renewables here in Portland,
01:50 - and this is where we have information coming in from all our farms across the country.
01:57 - Even the highest power computers
today can't simulate the atmosphere everywhere.
02:04 - In computer forecasting models, we have what
we call a grid. Each grid point is a latitude,
02:10 - and a longitude. We have to calculate the physics,
02:15 - and try to figure out wind speeds, temperature, pressure, that sort of thing.
02:21 - Since these are fairly big grids and we're doing this in a lot of points,
02:23 - we're looping over these
things millions and millions of times.
02:29 - Everything I do, I'll use for loops. Here for example
is a for loop right there.
02:38 - When you're forecasting wind, there's so many different parameters that go into it,
02:44 - that go into it it would be impossible for a human to sit down and do all those calculations.
02:51 - There's so many different aspects to what's going to be affecting the wind
02:55 - that we need a computer model in order to forecast it.
