00:01 - hello hi everyone I think my life now I
00:05 - sorry for the delay before so hi I'm
00:09 - Alice I'm president of code org I'm
00:11 - Tonya and I'm a product manager I'm Jake
00:14 - Novoa Marketing Coordinator here at work
00:16 - great so today we're going to walk
00:18 - through a few slides and finally
00:19 - sniffing those up right now going over
00:22 - what to expect for our code what's
00:23 - changed this year versus previous years
00:25 - and how you can be prepared if at any
00:28 - point your mistakes and questions for
00:30 - the end if at any point during this
00:31 - conversation you have questions the chat
00:33 - window is open throughout the
00:34 - conversation and we're going to answer
00:36 - those questions also as they come in so
00:37 - if you have any questions just ask them
00:39 - as you're going along so this is Alice
00:42 - he just met us so this is us again our
00:45 - agenda today we're gonna walk through
00:46 - quickly an update on what we're doing
00:49 - this year of our code and we're going to
00:51 - talk about the overview of volunteer in
00:53 - a classroom program shares from the
00:55 - feedback from teachers and students last
00:56 - year's teacher students and you guys
00:58 - volunteers and then we'll go through the
01:01 - volunteer toolkit and how you can be
01:02 - ready for the classroom so first of all
01:06 - for those of you who haven't done our
01:07 - code in the past one quickly introduced
01:09 - what this is all about the hour of code
01:12 - was designed to really break stereotypes
01:15 - around what computer science is I can
01:18 - tell you till I'm blue in the face the
01:19 - computer size is fun and interesting
01:21 - you're gonna like it it is totally
01:23 - different to actually get to try one
01:26 - hour yourself to get to build something
01:28 - and make something that you can be proud
01:30 - of and by making that an accessible
01:34 - experience where students can adjust one
01:36 - hour actually make their own game or
01:38 - have it really it makes them feel like
01:41 - they can do it it's been amazingly
01:44 - successful we see that most students who
01:46 - try it want to go beyond an hour which
01:48 - is actually the goal is that our goal is
01:50 - you know let's hook up with you know hey
01:53 - I can do this I can do it as a student
01:54 - and I can do it as a teacher we see
01:57 - especially a big increase in high school
02:01 - females where they're you know 20 points
02:03 - more likely how to survey to say that
02:06 - they are interested in studying computer
02:07 - science after doing an hour of code so
02:10 - really it really makes a big difference
02:13 - and I think because it makes a big
02:15 - difference because it's successful and
02:16 - it's an introductory way to try computer
02:19 - science we've seen it just take off
02:20 - around the world we started five years
02:23 - ago and at this point we've had over 100
02:25 - million students in every single country
02:28 - in the world so it's been amazing and
02:31 - doesn't large part to volunteers like
02:33 - you guys who are going to help new
02:35 - students at classroom to try and
02:36 - computer science so that retired before
02:39 - so what's new in 2017 first of all our
02:44 - focus this year is you know originally
02:47 - we've always been about more than an
02:49 - hour but originally it was really most
02:51 - of the class had never done this before
02:53 - and so we had a lot of teacher the
02:55 - students that were super nervous about
02:56 - you know the idea that they were going
02:58 - to teach computer science or something
03:00 - like a scary thing as VC schools doing
03:04 - this era over here we're breaking those
03:07 - stereotypes it's working yeah so now we
03:10 - want to see them go further an hour is
03:13 - not enough so when you're in the
03:14 - classroom your goal should not just be a
03:17 - duty hour of code but to encourage that
03:18 - school and that teacher to try teaching
03:22 - computer science we have tools available
03:25 - for everybody to do this so you don't
03:28 - need to be there as a volunteer to help
03:30 - them go teach computer science there are
03:32 - workshops that teachers can go to to
03:34 - help them we have tools for
03:36 - administrators to help them understand
03:38 - what it means to bring computer science
03:39 - to their school how they would add it to
03:41 - the course offerings how they would
03:42 - think about it we have tools for parents
03:45 - to help them you know advocate for
03:47 - computer science at their school the
03:49 - place to send people as you you know
03:51 - hopefully every classroom before you
03:53 - leave if you can send them to code org
03:55 - slash your school there's space there
03:58 - for them to find the resources there's
04:00 - also a survey there where you can write
04:03 - down what that school already teaches
04:05 - which is a key part of getting the
04:06 - school to teach more is understanding
04:08 - what does that school teach today so you
04:10 - know ask your teacher like do you guys
04:12 - teach you know does every kid at this
04:13 - school get computer science do just some
04:16 - kids get it is an elective did any kids
04:18 - get it surprisingly in the 21st century
04:21 - most schools today don't teach in any
04:24 - computer science at all in k-12
04:26 - so if you can help help fill this out
04:29 - with your schools that should bets a
04:30 - goal we also have made a bunch of
04:34 - updates the hour of code activity page
04:36 - and con you want to talk a little bit
04:37 - about what we're doing there
04:38 - so the Arkham activity page or our code
04:41 - comm slash learn is the catalog of all
04:44 - of the activities that we recommend for
04:46 - your students or the teachers that
04:48 - you're working with to track and so we
04:50 - are making some updates to make this
04:52 - more approachable and easier for new
04:54 - teachers and new students who are coming
04:55 - in to find the activities that are best
04:58 - suited for their age group their
05:00 - experience their interests we have over
05:02 - 200 tutorials of activities to offer so
05:05 - we definitely want to give them a way to
05:06 - search for what's best for them so we're
05:09 - making a couple of changes we are
05:11 - highlighting for example the age filter
05:14 - and the ability to see which tutorials
05:16 - are best suited for your age group and
05:19 - we're also giving it a some design
05:20 - update and make it even prettier and
05:23 - more engaging especially for high school
05:24 - students we often hear that they don't
05:26 - think that this is for them I think this
05:27 - is just for kids baby so we want to show
05:30 - them that it is for them it's actually
05:32 - for anyone even adults we want to make
05:34 - this page look more exciting engaging
05:36 - and let everyone know that anybody can
05:38 - learn we have some really advanced
05:39 - tutorials on there so it is definitely
05:42 - great for a computer science class as a
05:45 - way to celebrate us Education Week
05:46 - making something advanced maybe try a
05:49 - language and maybe they're learning
05:50 - JavaScript in class so they can do a
05:52 - 1-hour
05:52 - Python tutorial to learn about Python or
05:54 - you know something like that but yeah
05:57 - all ages definitely all ages and all
06:00 - experience levels I know it can be able
06:03 - to whelming to have that many different
06:04 - options so we're going to make it easy
06:06 - for you we have a team of teachers 15
06:10 - teachers who've gone through and played
06:12 - every single tutorial and they our staff
06:15 - ranked in order of what the teachers
06:16 - think are the best so you can look
06:19 - through as many as you want
06:20 - or if you just want to make it easy for
06:22 - yourselves pick your age group so like
06:25 - I'm doing 9 through 12th graders or I'm
06:27 - doing 6 through eighth grade and then
06:29 - the one in the very top is one that our
06:31 - teachers recommend so you can just go
06:33 - with that and not have to think about it
06:35 - um you can dig as much as you want
06:37 - they're a lot of fun but you can also
06:39 - just pick the
06:39 - one that's the one the teachers liked
06:41 - and stay tuned because of November we're
06:43 - gonna be adding even more tutorials for
06:46 - what they've been reviewed and submitted
06:47 - this year so we're gonna have some baby
06:49 - tutorial snaps later remember yeah we
06:53 - also have a remote volunteer list so yes
06:55 - and I just wanted to call out that the
06:57 - volunteers are different ways you can
06:59 - volunteer if you are near schools
07:03 - definitely try and go visit see those
07:05 - kids in person and meet the teachers of
07:08 - the students but we also encourage you
07:10 - to remotely volunteer so that means a
07:13 - teacher in a different state or even a
07:14 - different country can connect with you
07:16 - and you can just be honest that call or
07:18 - go hang out and speak to the students
07:21 - about your experience in tech and how
07:24 - you got to see us and what you think
07:25 - about the IRF code so that way we can
07:27 - even connect you with people outside of
07:29 - your area yeah go look at a hopefully
07:33 - you can get connected with teachers in
07:35 - Canada and Maui we can connect more
07:38 - teachers and volunteers across the area
07:40 - and this has been a real challenge too
07:42 - because our volunteers are not evenly
07:45 - distributed we have more volunteers and
07:47 - tech hub so if you're located in Silicon
07:50 - Valley or Seattle or another place with
07:52 - a lot of tech we have a lot of
07:54 - volunteers meanwhile in other places we
07:57 - have fewer volunteers but so being able
07:59 - to volunteer remotely helps with that
08:01 - and we'll talk a little bit more about
08:02 - this later but if you are in a tech hub
08:04 - you may not be contacted by a teacher
08:06 - but that doesn't mean you shouldn't
08:07 - reach out and we'll talk a little bit
08:08 - about that later so here's the overview
08:13 - of the timeline of the timeline sure so
08:16 - this is focused on the timeline for in
08:18 - preparation for the outcode what you
08:20 - want to do is make sure that you're
08:22 - ready to help the teachers early on
08:24 - because they need a lot of time to
08:26 - prepare before their hour of code a bit
08:28 - most of the our code events will be
08:30 - happening during computer science
08:31 - education week in December 4 to 10 but
08:34 - it varies some teachers their schedules
08:37 - are a little bit different they make it
08:37 - a little earlier they make it a little
08:39 - later so we want to try and give them
08:40 - extra time and have you connected and
08:43 - ready to go way before their hour of
08:46 - code of X so now is the time to sign up
08:48 - to volunteer if you have it yet please
08:50 - go visit code
08:51 - org slash volunteer and sign up so that
08:53 - teachers can see you and contact you and
08:55 - between October through November these
08:57 - teachers will be looking through the
08:59 - math finding volunteers in their area or
09:01 - maybe other areas for example if they
09:02 - want to get remote volunteers and
09:04 - they'll be contacting you
09:06 - we never share your email address with
09:08 - these teachers they are submitting a
09:10 - form echoes to us and you'll be
09:11 - receiving email from me with all of the
09:13 - teachers contact information so that you
09:15 - can choose to respond to them depending
09:18 - on what their request is I mean how you
09:19 - can pop up and then given that time
09:22 - between October November once you
09:23 - connect to the teacher and that's what
09:24 - you should coordinate maybe the things
09:27 - that they need for example a background
09:29 - check some schools univac rep check so
09:31 - if you provide that certain information
09:32 - or maybe sign a little bit of paperwork
09:34 - help them choose a tutorial guide them
09:37 - on what a text the text setup might be
09:41 - like each of the teachers needs can be a
09:43 - little bit different so wherever your
09:44 - strikes are try to be flexible to help
09:47 - teachers in that way and in up to 24
09:50 - that's our session today but after that
09:53 - once you are sent and connected with the
09:55 - teacher we will talk about next what you
09:57 - can expect out of your actual our code
09:59 - event yeah and you know um
10:02 - Tonya made it sound a little
10:04 - intimidating to get ready it's not that
10:06 - hard but you do need to be the best
10:08 - because even like the schools where you
10:10 - just go in and do it and there's not
10:11 - really any prep work these that but you
10:13 - still usually need to do a background
10:14 - check which means you'll need to fill
10:15 - out a little paperwork at the school and
10:17 - it takes a couple days for the skin each
10:19 - teacher is going to tell you what they
10:21 - need and if they don't need any great
10:22 - yeah also as a reminder after the our
10:26 - code will be sending a quick survey out
10:27 - to you to hear about your experience
10:29 - we'd love to know at what well and how
10:31 - it went and we need that information to
10:33 - continue improving here so feedback from
10:37 - last year we had thousands of volunteers
10:41 - promise if you're on the call who
10:43 - volunteered in classrooms 90% told us of
10:46 - it fill out their survey and told us
10:48 - they were satisfied or extremely
10:49 - satisfied and the other 10% we're
10:51 - working on trying to change things that
10:53 - didn't go as well as they could and what
10:56 - I thought was even more exciting was
10:58 - that 98% of the students and teachers
11:00 - thought they had a good or great
11:02 - experience and most of them
11:05 - went on to to go beyond an hour so most
11:08 - of them were inspired and actually they
11:12 - didn't stop an hour which is awesome
11:14 - actually this is my favorite set 18% of
11:17 - the teachers told us that they went on
11:19 - to teach in computer science course
11:20 - after doing the hour of code so that's
11:23 - not just a one hour change in that
11:25 - classroom that's a meaningful lasting
11:27 - impact over time so if you can try to
11:30 - get to be one of the volunteers who has
11:33 - your teacher join that eighteen percent
11:34 - that's the real goal so what if past
11:38 - volunteers told us you guys can read
11:43 - that I want to read them aloud to you um
11:45 - but you know they've told us that it's
11:48 - really exciting as a woman to be able to
11:51 - inspire other girls in computer science
11:54 - if you are a female or an
11:57 - underrepresented minority it's
11:58 - especially great to have you in violent
12:00 - Aryan because this to entirely see those
12:03 - role models in the tech field or in
12:06 - their career path and sometimes that can
12:07 - discourage girls from feeling like they
12:09 - should do computer science because they
12:11 - don't necessarily see women doing it so
12:13 - you know I especially encourage people
12:16 - in underrepresented minority groups or
12:18 - females to get out there and and be
12:20 - visible at this time for the classrooms
12:22 - and for the students if you have another
12:24 - one another person who you work with who
12:26 - you think would be great drag them out
12:28 - to ya and get them to also show up and
12:31 - be a role model for the kids as people
12:35 - enjoy talking to kids I think all of you
12:38 - do where you want to be on this call and
12:40 - then just seem that Suzy has some of
12:41 - their optimism kids are you know they're
12:45 - excited about it right this is one of
12:48 - those you know for the kids it's a
12:49 - really special day in school like this
12:50 - is a this is sort of a holiday for them
12:53 - it's an exciting moment like they're
12:54 - gonna get to do the power of code today
12:55 - and they're gonna you know build
12:58 - something and so it's pretty it's pretty
13:00 - exciting for them to do it and if you
13:01 - could share your excitement with them I
13:03 - think you'll just see it like
13:04 - reverberate and just comes back at you
13:06 - really exciting way um so we've had lots
13:15 - and lots and lots of teachers tell us
13:17 - how helpful it is to have
13:18 - a volunteer in their classroom it really
13:22 - makes a big difference for them and in
13:23 - particular you know I think it makes the
13:27 - biggest difference for the teachers who
13:28 - are the most you know unsure about
13:33 - technology or unsure about computer
13:35 - science for the teachers who have never
13:37 - tried this before this can make a really
13:39 - big difference for those two your
13:41 - presidents can really give them that
13:42 - confidence of how easy it is to get your
13:44 - students to try it because a lot of it
13:46 - is very self-service students just go on
13:49 - it they try it they don't need the help
13:50 - of the teacher and that way they get
13:52 - excited about teachers to get excited
13:54 - about see how they can also do it
13:57 - themselves we also see teachers who will
13:59 - I think this one of the volunteers was
14:01 - telling me they got called back because
14:02 - they helped one teacher with it and then
14:04 - the neighbor heater was like oh can I
14:06 - help me and can help me and instead of
14:08 - going back and helping every single
14:11 - class at the elementary school just
14:15 - pulled it over and over again to help
14:17 - out because once they started helping
14:18 - the teachers were like oh I could do
14:19 - that too I personally have had classes
14:23 - where I go in and the teacher had one
14:27 - class at a second-grade class where the
14:28 - teacher was beforehand was telling me
14:33 - like I don't know if we should do this
14:35 - like I've never done this before
14:37 - I don't even teach tech stuff on the
14:39 - computers like I don't even know how to
14:41 - setup the computers I you know are you
14:44 - sure we should do this like yes yes yes
14:46 - let's do it let's do it and and she must
14:49 - have called or checked in with me three
14:51 - or four times beforehand to be like you
14:53 - know you got it right like you're got
14:56 - their lesson plan I'm not in charge of
14:58 - anything and then like calling back hey
15:00 - so you're gonna run this class right
15:02 - because I'm not running it you're
15:04 - running it and so I got there we did it
15:06 - at the end of it she said to me she's
15:08 - like that was really fun the kids really
15:09 - liked it do you think we can do this
15:11 - every week like if we were teaching it
15:13 - not with me she didn't even come in
15:14 - every week she wanted to keep doing it
15:16 - on her own because she realized she
15:17 - could so I think you know the teachers
15:20 - being able to help the teachers you know
15:22 - give them the confidence and support to
15:24 - make this first step is a huge piece
15:26 - yeah for the question from somebody said
15:30 - they'd like to know if most volunteers
15:32 - actually teach her experience the
15:34 - teacher is just one thing to like talk
15:36 - about their career so oh yeah that's a
15:40 - great question
15:40 - it totally varies on what the teacher
15:42 - wants us wants help with we listed as
15:45 - both to the teacher so on the teacher
15:47 - facing parts of the website they see
15:50 - like a big thing saying get a volunteer
15:52 - speaker for your classroom and if they
15:55 - click that they get contacted it
15:56 - contacts you it we also say do you want
15:58 - help with a volunteer in your classroom
16:00 - for our code if they click that they get
16:02 - connected to you if they you know
16:04 - anything any really any help and so the
16:06 - teachers will reach out you guys are
16:09 - special in multiple ways you're special
16:11 - because you are comfortable with
16:13 - computers you're comfortable technology
16:15 - and you can help a teacher who doesn't
16:18 - know how to do this to lead the hour of
16:21 - code with their class but you're also a
16:23 - real-life connection to somebody with a
16:26 - job in the industry or in school
16:28 - studying computer science or maybe you
16:30 - studied computer science maybe you're
16:32 - not a computer scientist but maybe
16:34 - you're using your tech skills another
16:36 - role like you know maybe you're doing
16:38 - data science when we do market you do
16:39 - something with your tech background and
16:43 - it is really cool for the classrooms to
16:45 - talk to a person who actually does that
16:48 - job so some of the volunteer
16:50 - opportunities are can you speak to the
16:52 - entire class school like well yeah like
16:55 - we've had volunteers who go into the
16:57 - auditorium and they bring a whole school
16:59 - assembly and you're speaking to the
17:01 - school about what life is like as a as a
17:03 - software engineer sometimes it's with
17:06 - the classroom and they just want to
17:07 - bring in a real-life software engineer
17:09 - and the class will just ask you
17:10 - questions about it and sometimes it's
17:12 - helping out actually doing the hour of
17:13 - code with the class
17:15 - it's you know if you're working with the
17:17 - teacher and helping organize what the
17:19 - event is going to look like I would
17:21 - recommend that if you only have one hour
17:23 - it is super interesting to learn about
17:26 - software engineering from the car
17:27 - engineer but it is better to actually
17:29 - get the kids to do it themselves so if I
17:31 - if I'm working with a class and then we
17:33 - have one hour got one activity we can do
17:35 - I would encourage them to actually do
17:37 - the hour of code just answer like five
17:40 - minutes of questions at the end about my
17:42 - career what I do if you can encourage
17:45 - this
17:46 - to go further then it's really fun to do
17:48 - both to have the hour of code where the
17:51 - kids get to build it themselves
17:52 - and then also some time to ask you
17:54 - questions and learn about what a career
17:56 - in software is like socially every
17:59 - teacher will have the same need so if
18:01 - they are asking for the help that you're
18:02 - not competent it's okay let's not
18:04 - require that you have to actually teach
18:05 - the activity and even teaching it's like
18:08 - it's very minimal it's really easy that
18:10 - to say alright this is our code this is
18:12 - what it's about and we're gonna try it
18:13 - you direct us to the outer
18:15 - productivity's page I think the first
18:16 - one you know so if you are feeling extra
18:20 - balanced okay communicate the teacher
18:21 - what the expectations are and start that
18:23 - as part of your preparation that's a
18:25 - good point and if it's not a good fit
18:27 - for you there lots of other volunteers
18:28 - on the site so if you're like hey this
18:29 - isn't something that I'm the right
18:30 - person for I would encourage the teacher
18:32 - to pick somebody else from the list so
18:37 - hey this is a good transition so one of
18:40 - the questions was what you know if I'm
18:43 - asked to talk about my job what should I
18:45 - talk about and how to talk about my job
18:48 - so these are five best practices that
18:51 - will are you know designed to encourage
18:53 - especially diverse students to think
18:56 - that computer science is something they
18:57 - can do so the first is don't talk just
19:02 - about the code you write talk about the
19:03 - goals you're trying to achieve right for
19:06 - a kid it's gonna be less interesting
19:07 - whether you're writing in reactor you
19:09 - know whatever framework or JavaScript
19:12 - but what they found is that especially
19:15 - with girls
19:15 - everyone encouraged more diversity in
19:17 - computer science with girls and
19:18 - underrepresented minorities they want to
19:20 - see what they're gonna do with code so
19:22 - first thing is to talk about what you do
19:25 - with code what do you actually build and
19:27 - what do you accomplish with it and I was
19:29 - talking to one volunteer who was saying
19:31 - like well I it's like really back-end
19:35 - right like I work to make sure
19:37 - datacenter failover works and you know I
19:41 - don't I sure I'm going to talk to kids
19:42 - about that right and so I'd say like
19:43 - zoom out and think about well okay you
19:46 - know you're working on data center feel
19:48 - over how why do we have data center
19:50 - failover and how can you put that in
19:52 - terms like that kids might understand
19:54 - like you make sure that the internet
19:55 - doesn't go that was a huge fire and like
19:57 - the whole internet burned up
19:59 - this building like you need to to save
20:01 - all their data and their projects and
20:03 - you know and you're a part of making
20:05 - that happen
20:06 - but yeah think about how the larger
20:09 - goals that you're trying to create and
20:10 - then you know as much as possible turn
20:12 - it back on them when you're in front of
20:14 - a classroom asking the kids to answer
20:16 - questions is a great way to get
20:18 - engagement get them excited and make
20:21 - them really thin for themselves about
20:22 - what they want to do so you know I would
20:25 - flip it around and ask the kids you know
20:26 - what do you want to build what app would
20:28 - you want to make get like a whole room
20:31 - people so telling you what video game
20:33 - they're gonna make but it's super fun
20:34 - and they're excited or even just asking
20:36 - them what do they like what are they
20:37 - interested in the show that computer
20:40 - science really spans every industry you
20:42 - can connect what they like to what they
20:44 - might want to do in the future and show
20:46 - how CS help solve those problems
20:51 - yeah that's an awesome one to do another
20:53 - thing to think about is breaking the
20:55 - stereotype you know we hear people say I
20:57 - just talked to a girl who's a senior in
21:00 - high school her favorite class was
21:02 - computer science but she was thinking
21:03 - she didn't want to major in college
21:05 - because she wanted to work with other
21:07 - people I kind of broke my heart I'm like
21:10 - you will work with other people but if
21:14 - you have if you can help break the
21:15 - stereotype that computer science is
21:18 - something that we do all by ourselves
21:19 - think about an example in your job where
21:22 - you've worked with other people to solve
21:23 - a problem and share that that's part of
21:26 - you know helping helping them understand
21:28 - that computer science is not something
21:29 - that is done alone in your basement I
21:33 - mean it can be but most large software
21:35 - projects are not done alone they're done
21:37 - with very large teams working together
21:39 - and what your job that's an obvious one
21:42 - share something you love and the last
21:45 - one is something that I think sometimes
21:47 - we forget about doing especially with
21:49 - kids it's really intimidating to think
21:52 - that yeah computer science is something
21:55 - that you have to be you know I to be a
21:57 - mathlete or I have to be really smart or
22:00 - I can never fail if I ever like and and
22:03 - computer science is all about failure
22:05 - right I when you write software it just
22:08 - doesn't work the first time right and
22:10 - part of what
22:11 - Tina's persistence and grit and like
22:13 - failing keep trying and you know if you
22:16 - can model that for them about you know
22:18 - when I try it it's gonna fail a lot
22:28 - broke inside to fix it right over again
22:32 - things change all the time yeah any
22:34 - example that you have where they didn't
22:36 - go right the first time it shows that
22:38 - you made mistakes if you learn from it
22:40 - everybody does that's everybody
22:42 - everybody does yeah you know the time
22:44 - you applied for a job and didn't get it
22:45 - and try it again
22:47 - you know those are all great stories so
22:48 - I would think about how you can you know
22:51 - we all want to be our best selves but
22:53 - think about the times where you know you
22:55 - had a tough spot and that's really
22:56 - relatable to the to the kids so why wait
23:01 - to be contacted you can reach out
23:03 - especially in the Silicon Valley type
23:07 - areas or high tech hubs there's a lot of
23:11 - volunteers and you may not have a
23:13 - teacher reach out to you that doesn't
23:15 - mean there aren't teachers who are not
23:17 - offering this who totally could and
23:19 - should if you reached up to them I now
23:22 - is a fantastic time to start reaching
23:24 - out to if you have any connection to a
23:26 - school reach out to them and offer to
23:28 - help them do this that second grade
23:30 - teacher I was talking about didn't reach
23:32 - out on our website because she never
23:35 - reached up above our website so if you
23:40 - but when I went to her she's like okay
23:42 - okay we can do this right I mean they've
23:45 - heard of our code maybe they're excited
23:47 - about doing it the easiest is if you
23:50 - have kids reach out to your kids
23:53 - teachers because you already can't get
23:54 - to that school it's an obvious thing for
23:56 - you to volunteer in the classroom and
23:57 - help out maybe you have a friend who's a
24:00 - teacher and you can offer it to help
24:01 - them out in their classroom be a fun way
24:03 - to see what your friend gets to deal
24:04 - with every day um good and the bad right
24:07 - maybe your you volunteer at a school
24:11 - maybe your company volunteers with a
24:13 - school so maybe you guys have a
24:15 - relationship with a school through your
24:17 - company I would say you know what
24:20 - connected you have if you have any
24:21 - connection to any school in your area
24:23 - this is
24:24 - great opportunity to reach out
24:26 - proactively and we've got some sample
24:28 - letters on the website that you can send
24:30 - so you don't need to like come up with
24:31 - something from scratch to help you get
24:34 - started they're also after school
24:38 - organizations do you you know these are
24:41 - sometimes easier to get started with
24:42 - they usually don't have computers but
24:44 - you don't need computers to do the hour
24:46 - of code you can actually without a ton
24:47 - of activities for kids to learn
24:49 - computational thinking practices with no
24:51 - computers so group that meets in a local
24:54 - church can definitely do an hour of code
24:58 - so any any after-school organization the
25:01 - other thing about these after-school
25:02 - organizations is they don't have sort of
25:04 - all of the rigidity of a public school
25:08 - system so they can be a little bit more
25:10 - flexible in terms of you know when they
25:12 - meet how they me how you help they may
25:15 - even be interested in in coming to your
25:18 - work for the event like you know I can
25:21 - imagine
25:21 - I imagine I've seen you know things like
25:25 - you know a Girl Scout troop might come
25:26 - to your office and that could be a fun
25:28 - activity like you can be a little bit
25:29 - more flexible with some of these
25:30 - after-school clubs and organizations so
25:32 - if you're connected to anything
25:34 - offer to help you can also offer to help
25:37 - with a friends kids so maybe you've got
25:39 - a friend who's got a child at a school
25:41 - and you can offer to help out at their
25:42 - school and we've got tools to help you
25:47 - reach out to as well so you don't have
25:48 - to do this on your own and this should a
25:50 - question it's kind of on the flip side
25:53 - and one says that they've already had
25:55 - several requests from teachers in their
25:56 - area and because there aren't a lot of
25:58 - volunteers in their area yeah what can
26:00 - they do when they just can't help
26:01 - anymore oh oh okay so here's what I
26:11 - would do first is can you recruit other
26:13 - people at your office I might want to
26:17 - volunteer because I think there's a lot
26:19 - of people who would love to volunteer
26:20 - you know once a year in a classroom but
26:21 - don't think to do it see if you can you
26:24 - can get them to sign up on our website
26:26 - or just directly connect them let you
26:28 - feel free to just connect that teacher
26:29 - directly to somebody at your office if
26:31 - you could convince somebody else to help
26:33 - out if not I would encourage the
26:35 - teachers to find a remote
26:37 - dear teachers might not be searching for
26:39 - it but there are more than enough
26:40 - volunteers who are never contacted if
26:43 - they look for remote volunteers they'll
26:45 - be able to find so take a major city
26:47 - filter dr. Montag hear that oh yeah
26:50 - no more options tell them to try San
26:52 - Francisco look for my volunteers
26:53 - absolutely fine
26:54 - yeah how to run an hour of code
26:59 - okay so first check in with the teaching
27:02 - I need to know what technology you have
27:03 - you don't need any technology but if
27:06 - you've got computers you should know you
27:07 - have computers if your iPads if you die
27:09 - pad so figure out what the what you're
27:11 - using and then on our website you can
27:14 - filter this little check boxes you can
27:16 - filter based on the technology you have
27:18 - the easiest two things to do if you want
27:21 - to go easy especially you're not at the
27:23 - school to set it up is to do something
27:27 - that works on browsers or to do
27:28 - something with no technology needed so
27:30 - an unplugged activity requires more work
27:34 - to set up like you'll need to like if
27:35 - you're doing your staff and cups you'll
27:37 - need to bring cups we need to read the
27:39 - activity guides we need to prepare to
27:40 - teach that class the ones on the
27:42 - computers a lot of them are self-serve
27:44 - like you just put the kids in front of
27:46 - the computers and they'll work through
27:48 - it but you do need to have computers
27:51 - with internet connection there are also
27:53 - lots of activities that run on things
27:54 - like iPads but if you're going to use
27:56 - those you would need to install the apps
27:57 - and if you're not at the school you may
28:00 - not want to deal with making sure the
28:02 - app is installed on every iPad
28:03 - so the browser ones are the easiest ones
28:06 - to to use and most of the browser works
28:09 - also even still work I might add and
28:11 - mobile only they just have to open the
28:12 - browser on their device yeah exactly so
28:15 - this it says modern browsers and it'll
28:16 - be filtered so you can see like all of
28:18 - these will work on any device and then
28:20 - the easiest to do all of the activities
28:23 - require no sign up no sign in no login
28:27 - so you don't have to prep you just have
28:29 - to make sure the activity works and
28:32 - that's it I recommend checking at the
28:35 - school if possible and getting a teacher
28:37 - to check at the school a lot of schools
28:39 - have firewalls in place to prevent skids
28:41 - to go to a site fish and beyond and so
28:44 - as a result you can try it at home and
28:47 - it works great and then tried in the
28:49 - classroom it might just be blocked
28:51 - so just picnic tutorial you want and ask
28:53 - the teacher to just click on it and make
28:55 - sure it works from within the school so
28:59 - day of and and then also with preparing
29:02 - you're going to want to make sure that
29:03 - like we mentioned before that you most
29:07 - public schools in America require a
29:08 - background check before anybody can
29:10 - volunteer in the classroom with kids so
29:11 - you want to make sure you've done
29:12 - whatever you need to do to volunteer at
29:14 - that school day of you signing with the
29:18 - school meet the teacher
29:20 - we recommend spending most of the time
29:22 - getting the kids to actually build
29:24 - something on the activity because that's
29:26 - what you want them to walk away feeling
29:28 - like they can do this right so spend a
29:31 - few minutes introduce yourself
29:32 - talk about why computer science is
29:34 - exciting and we talked a little bit how
29:36 - to do that let the kids do it finish up
29:38 - you graduate the class and if your
29:42 - company has stickers kids love stickers
29:46 - any kind of slide that that is a picture
29:53 - of us in a classroom handing out or
29:55 - code.org stickers because that's the
29:57 - stickers we have it I recommend talking
29:59 - to the teacher before you give them out
30:01 - in case they want to save it for the end
30:02 - of the days that is exactly the bill the
30:04 - day and yeah make sure you bring a lot
30:07 - though they're gonna be more than your
30:10 - students okay I don't see I'm Hannah you
30:13 - should also keep in mind is if you plan
30:15 - on some pictures and sharing about your
30:17 - exposure to experience on social media
30:19 - please make sure you ask the teacher
30:21 - that's okay because technically you
30:23 - should be allowed to post pictures of
30:25 - these students unless they've signed it
30:27 - really so sometimes so just ask teachers
30:28 - see if that's okay before you post any
30:30 - pictures of the students and most
30:31 - schools have like we'll know which kids
30:34 - have signed the release in which ones
30:35 - haven't so they'll be like getting to
30:36 - pictures of these kids but not these
30:38 - ones the other thing that you don't see
30:40 - on here should add is the certificates
30:43 - kids love certificates and we can as
30:48 - part of this we have a website when you
30:50 - go to the how-to one of the steps is to
30:52 - print out certificates for all the kids
30:54 - then something you can't do the teacher
30:55 - can do because they know the names of
30:57 - all the students in the class but I
30:58 - would encourage your teacher beforehand
31:00 - to print out certificates for all the
31:02 - students and that
31:03 - you guys can hand them out and the kids
31:05 - can take them home and hang them on the
31:07 - wall and show their parents they love
31:09 - these certificates every year they
31:10 - collect the remains slightly different
31:12 - so
31:14 - the teachers to pick those out grab if
31:16 - they can yeah
31:18 - and then obviously encourage your school
31:20 - to go further and these are the teacher
31:22 - resources or a coda or teach and the
31:24 - other one is code.org slash your school
31:26 - and we'll send both those URLs so you
31:28 - have the URLs you want me to reprise
31:30 - those right now we have a link to the
31:33 - volunteer toolkit here we're gonna send
31:34 - that out as well it goes through
31:36 - everything in depth that you need and we
31:39 - also want to save some time for any
31:40 - questions anybody has has anybody take
31:42 - any questions you don't have any
31:44 - questions right now feel free to put it
31:46 - in the live chat you can answer any
31:49 - questions thank you guys for
31:59 - volunteering really appreciate the work
32:00 - that you're doing it makes a huge
32:03 - difference
32:03 - it really helps teachers to be able to
32:05 - offer this and it helps the students to
32:07 - see a real human who does this job
32:10 - especially for the students who grow up
32:14 - especially for the students who grow up
32:17 - in a place where maybe nobody they've
32:18 - ever met is doing this right like this
32:21 - is a mythical job field that they've
32:24 - never met anybody who does you know
32:26 - software engineering for a job and you
32:29 - know being able to be in a school where
32:30 - no kid has ever done software
32:31 - engineering and their parents don't do
32:33 - it at their uncles don't do it and then
32:34 - being able to be that role model for
32:37 - them of you know hey this is something
32:39 - that people do and here I do it and
32:40 - here's what I build and it demystifies
32:42 - it and I think it feels much more
32:44 - accessible and approachable yeah one
32:46 - comment now I just want to make is that
32:47 - in the description in this video we have
32:49 - a link to the tool kit that Alice
32:52 - mentioned as well as the resources on
32:53 - our website where you can find for how
32:56 - to get involved if you haven't signed up
32:57 - already there's a place to sign up you
32:59 - can see how your information is listed
33:01 - on the map where teachers view it and
33:03 - after this is over we'll add to that
33:05 - description the slides that we still
33:08 - have all of those resources that you
33:10 - need we have a question here about where
33:13 - can we get stickers where can you get
33:15 - stickers so most people just give out
33:17 - the stickers from their office because
33:19 - it's like hey I work it you know
33:21 - Microsoft so here are Microsoft stickers
33:22 - if you want to give code.org stickers on
33:25 - Kota on the our koat.com site there's a
33:29 - resources tab and under there there's a
33:31 - way to print out stickers handouts
33:35 - flyers like everything you might want it
33:38 - also has some videos that you can play
33:40 - to inspire the class and those are a
33:42 - great way to kick things off especially
33:44 - if you're not as comfortable you know
33:47 - kicking things off yourself in front of
33:48 - the classroom a video is a great way to
33:51 - get the kids all excited quiet sitting
33:53 - down paying attention and then you can
33:54 - talk after that so I like to when I when
33:58 - I teach I like to the hour go to the
34:00 - classroom I actually like to run the
34:02 - video first I'll pick one of the
34:04 - two-minute ones so it's quick and the
34:06 - kids get sort of it sort of amps the
34:08 - excitement in the air right like it's
34:10 - music and and celebrities and I was
34:14 - playing one of them and little kids are
34:16 - like they need more slippery than I did
34:17 - there like someone said I hope to get
34:28 - contacted but we'll also look at
34:29 - reaching out myself to a school in the
34:31 - area and I just wanted to highlight that
34:33 - I think you know because obviously the
34:35 - people that you find on the website the
34:36 - teachers that will be reaching out to
34:37 - you our teachers who already decided to
34:40 - do the hour of code but what would be
34:41 - amazing is if all of you or many of you
34:43 - went out to schools and found teachers
34:46 - who didn't know about the hour of code
34:47 - or who weren't already planning to do
34:50 - this and so it just helps us to spread
34:53 - it so yeah definitely teacher you know
34:55 - you can wait and teachers may contact
34:57 - you but by all means don't feel like you
35:00 - need to wait like outside reach out and
35:02 - talk to those schools someone says my
35:06 - kid is in middle school who at my kids
35:09 - school should I reach out to so if your
35:11 - kids in middle school they're multiple
35:12 - choices some schools have a tech person
35:16 - or a librarian or somebody who has
35:19 - services in between classes that's a
35:21 - great person to talk to you can also
35:23 - look at talking to the science teacher
35:26 - or the math teacher this can be a really
35:28 - fun activity for one of those subjects
35:31 - and this year we actually have
35:32 - subject-specific orioles so you can
35:35 - actually tie it into something there
35:37 - so you know you can tell you can either
35:40 - go sit with a science teacher and say
35:41 - hey let's do one hour of computer
35:43 - science as part of science generally or
35:45 - you can say something like a math
35:48 - teacher
35:49 - they actually have tutorials that teach
35:51 - angles and the computer science at the
35:53 - same time let's do this angles activity
35:55 - as part of you know one class period and
35:57 - it'd be a fun way to like teach the kids
35:59 - a little bit about computer science
36:01 - let them see this and also you know
36:03 - they'll do a little bit of math there's
36:04 - this in a disciplinary aspect we
36:06 - actually have this for almost every
36:08 - activity you know there's a there's
36:12 - examples on the website of like a
36:13 - history activity where they research the
36:15 - history of English computer science yeah
36:18 - like race how're you know yeah yeah and
36:21 - learn about learn about the history of
36:22 - computer science that was less fun for
36:25 - you to teach us on out but but I think
36:33 - in middle school when they have those
36:34 - subjects you know pick a subject or you
36:36 - think you have more of a chances
36:39 - sometimes a question about is it
36:41 - possible to run web-based apps from a
36:43 - browser I've had our Android tablet so
36:46 - that they don't need to have apps
36:47 - installed
36:48 - absolutely and most of our web-based
36:50 - ones will work that way from most of the
36:52 - providers all the code org tutorials the
36:54 - ones we built ourselves are design to
36:56 - work in a web browser on Android or iPad
36:59 - and they've been tested that way they
37:02 - work great so you can either drag and
37:03 - drop and the full experience designed to
37:06 - work on a browser on an iPad and we did
37:08 - it that way rather than installing an
37:10 - app so it would be easier for you to run
37:12 - it in the classroom without having to
37:13 - install apps in advance yeah that's just
37:17 - to say hi to their friend Brendan in our
37:19 - office we'll do that
37:26 - [Laughter]
37:30 - so we made a comment that you know what
37:32 - we went to City High School interested
37:36 - in how much money you can make an IT I
37:39 - thought it was pretty smart and
37:40 - forward-thinking about to kids about
37:43 - that yeah yeah you know what if it
37:45 - motivates the kids who are you how much
37:50 - money I think personally it's always an
37:54 - awkward question to say a lot if you
37:56 - work hard I think we have some stats on
38:05 - the website that you can use to if
38:06 - you're asked those questions and it
38:09 - shows how much more if you have code.org
38:11 - slash stats oh she's putting it on.the
38:14 - we'll add that link to put them but if
38:18 - you want some stats about why computer
38:20 - science is interesting or how how much
38:23 - money they will make in computer science
38:25 - let's see here Wizards have a stock up
38:28 - compares your first students who dog
38:30 - graduate college students graduate
38:32 - college that's how a computer science
38:33 - degree of students to capture a college
38:35 - with a computer degree they make almost
38:37 - three times as much as students who
38:38 - cheat at cards waiting with yeah it's
38:40 - the difference between graduating with a
38:42 - high school degree versus a college
38:44 - degree is about the same as the
38:46 - difference between graduating with a
38:47 - college degree and graduate of the
38:48 - college degree in computer science
38:50 - they make forty percent more than an
38:51 - average in the Army Major yeah an
38:55 - average computer college graduate so
38:57 - yeah it's a good career you can make
39:00 - money
39:01 - what are some other like motivations if
39:03 - it's not money like what would you say
39:05 - to some students in a classroom to
39:06 - motivate them to think about studying
39:08 - computer science I think mostly you know
39:11 - the the research is that like enabling
39:13 - you to solve problems in the world like
39:16 - that's what's motivating to a lot of
39:17 - students so if they think of themselves
39:19 - as creators of software instead of just
39:22 - users of software and you get them
39:24 - thinking about like well what is a
39:25 - problem that I want to solve whether
39:27 - that might be a lot of it's a local
39:29 - problem in their school like maybe
39:31 - there's a you know bullying problem in
39:34 - their school or you know maybe it's just
39:35 - how do i healthy foods at lodge or you
39:39 - know just
39:40 - local local problems they have or
39:42 - problems that they see outside in the
39:43 - world like how can I help the
39:44 - environment with computer sense what
39:46 - kind of app could I create that would
39:48 - help the environment and that's
39:49 - something that is motivating for
39:51 - students whatever cause they care about
39:52 - I think it's just reiterating that a lot
39:55 - of people think it's only math and
39:56 - science you have to be strong in that
39:58 - but actually it is very creative and we
40:00 - get to design things or break down a
40:04 - problem into different ways and that way
40:06 - it is created because you can solve it
40:07 - somebody may seem to decide what's good
40:09 - what's bad when one of the trade-offs so
40:12 - emphasize they may know have to be a
40:14 - super math and Cypress if anybody can
40:16 - really learn how to the core concepts of
40:19 - computer science and like why but key
40:22 - thing for me and I think a lot of people
40:23 - is that computer science can impact so
40:26 - many things and it can be used different
40:28 - ways and particularly for a person who
40:30 - has so many interests it doesn't know
40:32 - where to go and computer science if you
40:34 - change your writing you want to be an
40:36 - accountant and then you want to go to
40:37 - entertain they're there you want to go
40:39 - into agriculture you're going to have
40:41 - you can we use those skills in any
40:44 - industry you don't need to start over
40:46 - and go back school yeah if kids are
40:49 - excited to like that they the research
40:51 - shows that especially girls are excited
40:53 - to solve problems with computer science
40:55 - so the more you can tie it to those what
40:59 - they care about and what problems
41:00 - they're trying to solve and then get my
41:02 - math is you get a ton of kids who want
41:04 - to make video games every year every
41:06 - time and that's okay too
41:07 - that's okay too if they want to if they
41:09 - want any love you know if they're one
41:12 - study computer science so they can make
41:13 - video games or their own version of
41:16 - snapchat that's better than the version
41:17 - that's out there or you know apps they
41:21 - use you know that's fantastic I knew had
41:27 - someone who made it very comment about
41:28 - as far as who you should talk to you in
41:31 - the school it's in the you know toggle
41:32 - they found in their experience it's
41:33 - always best to talk directly to the
41:35 - teacher they've done that for a few
41:36 - times with their kids classes it always
41:38 - starts they said if your kids in middle
41:39 - school usually you can start with a
41:41 - homeroom teacher and that would be
41:43 - someone you're getting you help yourself
41:44 - thank you yeah that is a great idea yeah
41:47 - my kids in the middle school doesn't
41:49 - have home rooms but but yes if your kids
41:52 - have homeroom
41:52 - Advisors that's all so usually they're
41:54 - advocates for the students and that's a
41:56 - great place to start
41:57 - great idea what questions so feel free
42:01 - to send them questions if you have them
42:03 - I just want to reiterate the resources
42:06 - from the description of the video and
42:08 - you know check back we'll be adding some
42:10 - of the links that you know as alice has
42:12 - been mentioning different resources on
42:13 - our website I'll be sure to add those
42:15 - there as well so you have a nice
42:17 - one-stop shop for all of those resources
42:19 - and you know if you're nervous and you
42:20 - haven't done this before just try one of
42:22 - the hours of code like do you it Chinese
42:25 - yeah go to our cook our first one it
42:28 - doesn't matter any of the top six are
42:30 - all really easy to use great for getting
42:34 - started
42:35 - and you just pick one of them and try it
42:37 - out and you'll get a really good sense
42:39 - of what its gonna be like in the
42:40 - classroom the they're designed to be
42:42 - self pay for students so you don't need
42:45 - to tell the student what to do you just
42:46 - set them in front of the computers and
42:48 - the activity guides itself and you can
42:50 - just answer questions or you know helps
42:52 - us do that's out and in fact you get
42:55 - questions it's actually better to tell
42:57 - us to ask your neighbor and I try to
43:00 - figure out themselves so even then it's
43:02 - not a lot of you because it's like well
43:04 - why don't you see if you know if you're
43:07 - walking through the classroom yet
43:08 - helping a student I have a question put
43:09 - it back on that why do you think that
43:13 - and you'll be surprised don't think
43:15 - about anything like oh okay let me try
43:17 - this instead so there's no pressure even
43:19 - if you haven't tried it tutorial if
43:21 - they're doing you the best way to help
43:23 - with sort of the Socratic method ask
43:25 - them more questions and get that visitor
43:26 - arrived at the plate looking ya can help
43:30 - like foster growth mindset of the
43:32 - students and I keep trying and also
43:34 - teach them cooperation with each other
43:36 - we have a little thing on our side this
43:37 - is ask three than me so ask three
43:39 - students before you ask me and that also
43:42 - helps the students figure things out and
43:44 - feel really empowered when they figure
43:46 - it out together if a lot of students
43:47 - also pair program which keep their could
43:49 - be two students per device on a laptop
43:52 - or an iPad and that's also a mily
43:55 - recommended especially if you don't have
43:56 - enough devices for each do it we can
43:58 - still do the our code and that way that
44:01 - when they're paired with each other they
44:02 - could bounce off ideas of it - exactly
44:06 - someone made a comment that city on the
44:08 - map for volunteers searching doesn't
44:10 - work for them they're specific city oh
44:12 - no I was just going to say if you email
44:14 - volunteers at code.org with any issues
44:19 - that you have with your kind of your
44:20 - listing and we're working got a couple
44:22 - of things before we get to the our code
44:24 - hopefully actually dr. description but
44:28 - there are a couple of things that we're
44:29 - working through some anytime you see a
44:31 - choice to let us know absolutely and
44:33 - we're trying to make that as soon as
44:35 - possible
44:35 - you to edit your preferences for you to
44:38 - see yourself a map in the right place
44:49 - any other questions
44:52 - great well thank you again for
44:54 - volunteering with love that you guys are
44:56 - going to be in the classroom and good
44:59 - luck if you have any questions you can
45:01 - always reach us we're here at once
45:04 - here's a code that are oh yeah yep
45:06 - volunteers at code.org great thank you
