00:00 - hi my name is j Whitney I'm an officer
00:02 - for our indigenous communities
00:03 - fellowship at Mat solve and I'm
00:05 - originally from the chalk toown nation
00:06 - of Oklahoma the thing that I love about
00:09 - computer science is the way that it
00:11 - Blends technology and creativity it has
00:14 - this kind of innate logic or language to
00:16 - it that you can learn and then use that
00:18 - to take your own spin to it and build
00:21 - your own projects or ideas and be able
00:24 - to share those with the world when I was
00:26 - growing up we went to the public library
00:28 - a lot and I loved getting all different
00:30 - kinds of books but I especially loved
00:32 - getting children's poetry books by
00:34 - authors like shell Silverstein and Jack
00:36 - pruty and I loved how they had these
00:38 - funny poems next to like weird little
00:40 - drawings that they did and so that
00:42 - really inspired me to do the same thing
00:44 - I published my first book of poetry at
00:46 - age 15 I think I had two different types
00:49 - of poems so one poem type was the funny
00:52 - silly I just want to be creative and see
00:55 - what kind of weird things I can do and
00:57 - then the other kind was more of a I have
00:59 - all these big feelings that I'm trying
01:01 - to sort through and I want to add some
01:03 - kind of order to them and so by putting
01:05 - them into poetry it made them feel like
01:07 - more tangible and more easy to deal with
01:09 - I think the thing that I did borrow from
01:11 - my tribe is similarly in our
01:13 - storytelling we have a lot of like
01:14 - anthropomorphic animals and so I think
01:17 - that kind of maybe more absurdist
01:19 - approach to like how can these weird
01:21 - things teach us important life lessons
01:23 - poetry and computer science are similar
01:26 - in the sense that you can use them to
01:28 - express yourself in different ways and I
01:30 - think both of them have an end result
01:32 - that is sort of concrete that you can
01:34 - share with others and by using those
01:37 - forms of self-expression you can also
01:40 - help to understand your own identity
