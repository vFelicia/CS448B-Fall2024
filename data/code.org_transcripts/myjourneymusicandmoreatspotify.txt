00:08 - hello everyone my name is meg i am an
00:10 - engineer at code.org and i will be
00:13 - moderating today's chat
00:15 - thanks to all the classrooms for coming
00:17 - out to our first my journeys clash chats
00:20 - of the spring
00:21 - teachers we have enabled live closed
00:24 - captioning for all of our class chats
00:25 - going forward
00:27 - today we are fortunate to have not one
00:29 - but two guests puja and himanshu joining
00:32 - us from spotify to tell us about their
00:35 - journey to where they are now what they
00:37 - do at spotify and how they use computer
00:39 - science in their jobs they'll also share
00:41 - helpful advice for students who might be
00:43 - thinking about a career in computer
00:45 - science
00:46 - teachers please please please put
00:49 - questions in the chat that come up and
00:51 - we will try our best to get to some of
00:53 - those at the end of the talk
00:55 - so we're going to start with some
00:57 - introductions and an icebreaker
00:59 - the ice breaker for today is because you
01:02 - all work at spotify who or what is on
01:04 - your favorite spotify playlist right now
01:08 - so i'll go first my name is meg i will
01:10 - be moderating i personally have been
01:13 - listening to lots of broadway lots of
01:15 - disney recently moana's how far i go has
01:19 - been on repeat if you know that song so
01:22 - puja and himanchu please share a little

01:32 - everybody my name is puja dave and i'm
01:35 - so so excited and happy
01:37 - to be here with all of you today i work
01:40 - at spotify i'm a senior engineering
01:43 - manager in the spotify advertising space
01:47 - so myself and my team we run
01:51 - what the ads that you see on the spotify
01:53 - app so if you are using a spotify and
01:56 - listening to music
01:58 - on the free uh version uh you will get
02:00 - ads while you're listening whether
02:02 - that's an ad you see or whether that's
02:05 - an ad you hear
02:07 - that's what my team works on we work on
02:09 - the engineering side where we write a
02:11 - lot of code to make that happen uh in
02:14 - terms of when you're listening what
02:16 - would be
02:18 - an ad that would be relevant to you when
02:20 - should we show that ad what should that
02:22 - ad be how should that ad look like
02:25 - um uh or sound like is uh what my team
02:28 - is responsible for it's a very exciting
02:30 - space to be in
02:32 - um i've been at spotify for five years
02:34 - prior to that i was working at microsoft
02:38 - for seven years and about 12 years ago i
02:41 - graduated
02:42 - from carnegie mellon university in
02:44 - pittsburgh and i did my master's in
02:46 - electrical and computer engineering
02:49 - uh icebreaker question love that
02:50 - question
02:51 - uh
02:52 - my spotify app actually has been
02:55 - hijacked by my two kids right now
02:58 - and what's on the playlist is baby shark
03:01 - for my
03:02 - little one uh she loves it she keeps
03:05 - listening to it over and over again
03:08 - whether or not i like it i also listen
03:10 - to it so that's what on my spotify app
03:12 - and playlist right now
03:14 - uh with that over to you
03:16 - himanshu thanks puja um
03:19 - so i just looked up my spotify's uh
03:22 - light songs and the top one is a song
03:24 - called doves
03:25 - from a band called we are all astronauts
03:29 - i love spotify for its discover weekly
03:32 - thing so every week there's new songs
03:34 - which i love to my heart
03:36 - but i have never heard of it so grateful
03:38 - to work um you know work here and you
03:41 - know contribute to the part of the
03:42 - journey so hey everyone my name is
03:44 - himanshu i'm tuning in from stockholm
03:46 - sweden it's about evening time right now
03:50 - i came here to work for spotify about
03:52 - one and a half years ago
03:55 - i'm a software engineer here but
03:56 - recently transitioning into this new
03:58 - role called developer advocate and which
04:01 - i can talk about later but i had not
04:03 - heard of this role when i was in college
04:06 - um so grateful to the all the people who
04:08 - help you know
04:10 - people like me
04:11 - trying to explore new things and hoping
04:14 - i can do the same today
04:16 - um i graduated from india about three
04:19 - years ago
04:20 - and i studied mathematics and computer
04:22 - science
04:23 - uh over there and at spotify i've been
04:27 - so you can imagine spotify is a huge app
04:30 - you can play it on your tv on your
04:33 - playstation phone laptop you know so
04:35 - many devices there's got to be like
04:37 - thousands of engineers
04:39 - putting in code to make that happen so i
04:42 - work on a software which helps those
04:44 - engineers do their daily job
04:46 - um and
04:48 - that's it over to you meg
04:51 - thank you all so much for being here and
04:54 - for sharing himanshu i want to throw it
04:55 - back to you could you maybe share a cool
04:58 - project that you've worked on with code
05:02 - sure uh let me share my screen um
05:10 - so
05:11 - i'm not sure if you all
05:12 - can you see the right screen uh you
05:14 - should have yeah you got it awesome
05:16 - thank you
05:17 - so uh
05:18 - when i was in college i got to know
05:20 - about this thing called github and open
05:23 - source um
05:25 - so the whole philosophy was that you can
05:27 - create anything you want
05:30 - and work with other people um so
05:33 - yeah i love open source i've been
05:35 - creating multiple projects when i was in
05:37 - college and most often than not not
05:40 - those projects came out of my own
05:42 - personal interest
05:43 - i'm not sure if you if you
05:45 - if you remember him
05:47 - but this this tv series called friends
05:49 - and i'm obsessed with it and i was
05:51 - obsessed with it as well and there's
05:54 - like 200 over 200 episodes and i've
05:57 - watched them the whole entire season
05:59 - couple of times
06:01 - but i wanted to watch more like random
06:03 - episodes from the from the series and i
06:06 - found that i when i was going into my
06:09 - directory and click finding the right
06:11 - season and clicking a random episode it
06:14 - wasn't so random at all i was always
06:16 - clicking in the middle and always
06:18 - clicking you know somewhere somewhere in
06:20 - the middle of my screen and i was
06:22 - watching the same episodes again and
06:24 - again
06:25 - so this is a tool i created
06:27 - to help me binge watch things so i
06:30 - loaded up all all the
06:32 - tv series that i wanted to watch and uh
06:35 - just i used to open this up and click on
06:37 - something and i wish to get like a new
06:39 - episode just like in the in the gif
06:42 - um
06:43 - so yeah and i also wanted to explore a
06:45 - new technology
06:47 - that's one of the reasons why i like
06:49 - open source and doing multiple projects
06:51 - is that
06:52 - you have to build something new why
06:54 - don't you build it in a new programming
06:56 - language and new framework for example
06:59 - so i wanted to learn javascript back
07:01 - then and this is what i created um
07:04 - and i put it up on reddit there's this
07:06 - website um not sure if if um there's an
07:10 - age limitation but i put it up on the
07:12 - programming subreddit and i said hey i'm
07:15 - new to javascript give me feedback
07:18 - and i got people commenting on my code
07:20 - helping me like you know refactor stuff
07:23 - and you know adjust things and make it
07:26 - better and all so
07:27 - overall this is the project i wanted to
07:29 - share um i think
07:32 - yeah if you're if you're in college and
07:34 - want to learn new things i think doing
07:36 - projects is a great way to do that
07:38 - what do you meg
07:40 - thanks for sharing him on you puja i
07:42 - want to throw it back to you and ask can
07:45 - you walk us through how you got from
07:47 - puja in school to puja at spotify so
07:50 - what courses you took what learning you
07:52 - had both in school and after school
07:55 - yeah i would love to share my journey um
07:57 - i do have some visuals so i will also
08:00 - take the liberty of uh sharing my screen
08:04 - um
08:05 - give me one second here
08:09 - and can you guys see megan yes we got it
08:12 - thanks that is me
08:14 - this is when i graduated um over a
08:17 - decade ago um
08:20 - from cmu
08:21 - um so my journey has been
08:24 - you know when i was in high school um i
08:27 - was very interested in uh
08:30 - engineering and logic in programming and
08:33 - physics math those were my favorite
08:35 - subjects um so while i was uh trying to
08:38 - see what do i want to do next
08:40 - a team that has been in my entire
08:42 - journey is
08:44 - learning from others interacting from
08:46 - other with others and seeing what
08:47 - they're doing that for me was
08:49 - exploration to see what is out there in
08:51 - the world what are all my options um and
08:54 - what excites me the most what makes me
08:57 - uh very happy within when i'm doing that
09:00 - um so i spoke with a lot of family
09:02 - members with a lot of peers my own
09:04 - friends people who were working in the
09:06 - industry joining sessions like these
09:09 - um to see what is out there what does
09:11 - software engineering even mean in the
09:13 - real world and that's where i learned
09:15 - more and i was clear that after high
09:18 - school i wanted to go into undergraduate
09:19 - and do my engineering so that led me to
09:22 - do electrical engineering i started off
09:24 - being very interested in the hardware
09:27 - behind the scenes what happens when um
09:29 - you're working with the you know the the
09:32 - actual hardware of computer systems what
09:35 - is inside the laptop how do you work
09:37 - with that i i remember tampering with
09:39 - back in the day we used to have walkmans
09:42 - um you know as a as the audio device no
09:45 - no spotify so i would just tinker with
09:47 - that i would open it i would start
09:49 - seeing all the capacitors start
09:50 - soldering it etc so that led me to
09:53 - electrical engineering and then after
09:55 - the first two years of being so involved
09:58 - in the hardware
09:59 - i got exposed to software and the power
10:02 - that programming had
10:04 - to operate those devices um
10:07 - so i started taking courses like
10:10 - objective oriented programming which is
10:13 - around java and c sharp
10:16 - sql databases i started getting my hands
10:19 - dirty into programming uh starting from
10:21 - very simple code whether that's with
10:23 - python and just you know make with
10:25 - astrix make a christmas tree um solving
10:28 - those kind of things got me excited uh
10:30 - and that led me to
10:32 - hey i want to do more of this two years
10:34 - is not enough
10:36 - in the last four years of my engineering
10:38 - so i decided to do masters in computer
10:40 - science and that's when i came to the
10:42 - united states
10:44 - in the master's program i got deeper
10:47 - into all of these programming concepts
10:49 - um and i took courses like you know uh
10:52 - operating systems
10:54 - um wireless networks um
10:57 - packet switching i was very interested
10:59 - back then in
11:01 - in wireless communications etc i spoke
11:04 - with as i said a theme was talking to
11:07 - people so i spoke with my professors my
11:09 - tas my classmates my peers
11:12 - where do they come from what excites
11:14 - them what are they doing
11:16 - what are my options basically that to
11:19 - explore and learn
11:20 - with which is the path forward
11:23 - that led me to my first job which is at
11:26 - microsoft then i became a software
11:28 - developer there
11:30 - um and i got an exposure into how do you
11:33 - do all of that programming in the real
11:35 - world building things that people are
11:38 - using
11:39 - um so that was a very very interesting
11:41 - and fun experience to be exposed to all
11:43 - of that i remember my first day sitting
11:45 - on the computer and be like i don't know
11:47 - what i'm supposed to do here um and
11:50 - there were things uh i still don't know
11:52 - you always learn um so the first few
11:55 - months i had to learn a new programming
11:57 - language c sharp which was similar to
11:59 - java um so i rely a lot on the 70 2010
12:02 - model uh a leadership model which means
12:05 - 70 of what you learn
12:07 - is uh by doing so you know stuff like
12:10 - assignments or projects is most of the
12:13 - learning happens there
12:14 - twenty percent is what you learn by uh
12:17 - you know talking to other people
12:19 - listening to their experiences uh how do
12:21 - they approach problem solving um etc and
12:25 - then 10 is through books through
12:28 - academics to trainings for courses so
12:30 - you know books like headfirst java uh
12:32 - for java and i had to learn c plus plus
12:35 - so essential c plus plus i took that
12:37 - book up design patterns i took a lot of
12:40 - courses
12:41 - to just teach myself on the job
12:44 - and after spending seven years at
12:46 - microsoft i am now at spotify
12:49 - um this is actually in the stockholm
12:52 - office himanshu where you are i'm i'm
12:54 - working from new jersey uh
12:57 - and i at spotify i've been here for five
12:59 - years still still very much learning all
13:01 - the time learning and doing software
13:04 - engineering so now my job is as i said
13:07 - earlier is these are the ads that i was
13:09 - talking about so when you're listening
13:11 - to spotify
13:13 - the ads that you see or hear what is the
13:15 - engineering and the programming that
13:17 - goes behind it
13:18 - so that's what me and my team um develop
13:21 - um so how do you see these ads what does
13:24 - the um experience look like um you know
13:27 - whether it should be a visual ad when
13:30 - should it play when you're listening to
13:31 - the song should it be at the 10th second
13:33 - should it be at the 20th second what
13:35 - happens when you click on the ad does it
13:37 - go and navigate to some place else and
13:39 - there's a lot that goes on
13:41 - uh from a software engineering point of
13:43 - view
13:44 - um
13:44 - [Music]
13:46 - and yeah that's been my journey i'll
13:47 - cover this later actually
13:49 - but uh
13:50 - the two things i would say a takeaway
13:52 - that has always helped me in that
13:54 - journey is uh trying to seek that
13:56 - clarity uh it is okay if you do not know
13:59 - what you want to do
14:00 - but attempting to explore and see what
14:02 - are my options out there and what
14:04 - excites me the most is my calling uh in
14:07 - the 12 years i did not know i would be
14:10 - here today um i did not know i would be
14:13 - in software engineering but it was a
14:15 - journey of trials and errors and seeing
14:18 - what works for me
14:19 - and learning uh
14:21 - during that journey and the second thing
14:23 - i would say is believe in yourself
14:25 - uh it's okay to make mistakes it's okay
14:28 - to not know what you're doing um but
14:30 - that's the fun that's the challenge uh
14:33 - each one of you bring a very unique
14:35 - quality um to everything that you work
14:38 - on and that's what in the real world
14:40 - matters everything that we're making at
14:42 - the end of the day is being used by
14:44 - people like us uh by people like you you
14:47 - are listening to spotify and that's what
14:49 - we want when we are building those
14:51 - things when we're creating those things
14:52 - we want that diversity to show in what
14:55 - we're building um so whether you're from
14:57 - a different part of the world whether
14:59 - you speak another language uh you come
15:02 - from a different background all of that
15:04 - is uh what makes you and what teams like
15:07 - us and people like us at spotify or any
15:09 - any other company looks for
15:12 - so try to seek that clarity and try to
15:14 - believe believe in yourself you can do
15:16 - it and that's been my journey where i am
15:17 - today and i'm very fortunate and blessed
15:20 - uh to be here
15:24 - thanks so much for sharing y'all we've
15:26 - got some good comments and questions in
15:28 - the chat so keep them coming i do want
15:30 - to shout out maureen garda's class they
15:33 - are in pittsburgh and cmu is in their
15:36 - hometown so it's very exciting
15:40 - we also got a question in the chat this
15:42 - is from uh lorenda hints
15:45 - um himachal i'm gonna ask this to you
15:47 - and then puja if you want to add on you
15:48 - can so you mentioned learning a new
15:51 - coding language do you find that
15:53 - learning a new coding language is easier
15:55 - if you already know another coding
15:57 - language
15:59 - um
16:00 - yes and no
16:02 - yes it's easier if you have worked in
16:04 - that area before so for example when i
16:07 - had learned
16:08 - java in school
16:10 - um
16:11 - and when i had to learn c plus plus on
16:14 - the job
16:15 - they were different but the principles
16:18 - of those two languages were very similar
16:21 - so it did help me understand that a lot
16:23 - faster
16:24 - but uh
16:26 - the know of my answer is
16:28 - sometimes there's so many programming
16:30 - languages
16:32 - that are out there python react node.js
16:34 - javascript and conceptually uh they're
16:37 - not always the same and that's okay
16:40 - so i've also had to teach myself uh
16:43 - python or scripting languages like
16:45 - javascript which are very different from
16:47 - uh object oriented you know
16:49 - objective-oriented languages like java
16:51 - um
16:53 - but it is you learn you learn in the
16:55 - process uh conceptually software
16:57 - engineer it's all within the same
16:59 - umbrella um so you you learn over time
17:03 - so i would say if you know uh
17:06 - something similar that helps but if you
17:08 - don't know that's fine too
17:13 - sure i think that that's spot on um i
17:16 - would something that i'm finding out
17:17 - recently is that there are families of
17:20 - programming languages so whenever
17:22 - someone is creating a new one um they
17:24 - are already influenced by something
17:26 - existing
17:27 - um so for example this thing called
17:29 - golang
17:30 - something that all the creators shared
17:33 - between them was they all hated c
17:34 - business i'm just saying that there is
17:36 - an influence um coming coming from pre
17:39 - existing languages so for example if you
17:42 - if you like javascript uh you would find
17:44 - that it depends or it takes inspiration
17:47 - a lot from python
17:49 - that just happened but if you want to
17:51 - learn something called erlang you'd like
17:54 - you'll be like what there's no for loop
17:56 - in here um so it's like a functional
17:58 - programming language
18:00 - tree and it's very hard to break into it
18:02 - if you already know like let's say c
18:04 - plus plus java or python because it's a
18:06 - different family of languages so it does
18:08 - help to you know if you know one
18:10 - in that family so i would i would
18:12 - recommend like trying out a very low
18:14 - level language like c for example but
18:16 - then try out something which is very
18:18 - high level like python for example
18:20 - um learning things from different
18:22 - families will help you uh understand
18:25 - like
18:26 - new if something new is thrown at you
18:28 - you can actually make connections and
18:30 - you know try to understand something um
18:33 - in in in this new thing that's being
18:34 - thrown at you that's just something to
18:36 - add
18:39 - thanks both for sharing i want to move
18:41 - to something outside of tech so i'm
18:44 - curious what do you enjoy doing outside
18:46 - of work what's something interesting
18:47 - about yourself himanshu can we start
18:49 - with you
18:51 - sure absolutely um
18:53 - so what do i do outside of work a lot of
18:56 - things i found out that i don't have
18:58 - like one or two hobbies and i'm
19:00 - kind of the person who likes to try out
19:02 - multiple things for example recently i'm
19:04 - doing a lot of gaming and there's this
19:06 - new pc that you can see in the
19:07 - background just arrived two weeks ago
19:09 - and all my weekends are just being
19:11 - sucked on on that computer um
19:14 - i like cooking a lot so i live in
19:16 - stockholm and my parents live in india
19:19 - and they like to know that i'm eating
19:20 - well so i cook indian food and just send
19:23 - pictures to make sure you know they're
19:25 - they're happy
19:26 - when i was in school i got into poetry
19:29 - um i found out that
19:31 - writing is a very
19:34 - writing is a great way to express
19:35 - yourself and sometimes you know it's
19:38 - it's very hard uh so yeah poetry writing
19:40 - short stories i had like unpublished
19:43 - short novels uh in school i no longer
19:46 - write that much but i found out that
19:48 - that really helps me
19:49 - um what else uh i like to play a lot of
19:52 - football soccer for you folks uh in the
19:54 - us um to play fifa and then when it's
19:57 - summer in stockholm also like meet my
20:00 - fellow spotifyers and we play together
20:02 - on a field
20:03 - um yeah i like to do different things i
20:06 - i think um looking at world from
20:08 - different perceptions is super helpful
20:10 - uh i would like to know how an artist
20:12 - thinks of the world and not just and how
20:15 - engineer looks at the world so that's
20:17 - why i'd like to try out things i'm not
20:19 - good at any of those things
20:22 - puja over to you
20:25 - yeah i can screen share again the sneak
20:28 - peek that i gave you the last time
20:30 - um
20:31 - just to give you an insight into can you
20:35 - guys see my screen
20:38 - not yet
20:39 - uh
20:41 - all right you see what's going on here
20:46 - okay this should work now yes we got it
20:51 - perfect
20:52 - so
20:52 - for me um
20:54 - it's traveling um
20:57 - which is changed in the last
20:59 - year or two but before that um i love to
21:03 - travel i love to explore different parts
21:06 - of the world so i've put a few pictures
21:08 - here together um
21:10 - where you know i'm excited there in the
21:13 - swiss alps
21:15 - to see the modern lights in um in
21:17 - finland uh that was a fun experience
21:20 - to do ice fishing as well uh in finland
21:24 - uh so i like doing things that the
21:25 - locals uh like doing i did catch a fish
21:28 - and i was the only one who did that day
21:31 - um
21:33 - the one below there with me and the
21:35 - camera i was into photography a few
21:38 - years ago uh was me in africa we were
21:40 - taking a safari in tanzania and i got
21:43 - some amazing pictures in that trip
21:46 - and to see you know almost lion king
21:48 - being played in real life
21:51 - and then we i have a few pictures here
21:53 - that's my son there enjoying pizza in
21:55 - naples
21:57 - or uh you know in greece all of this to
22:00 - say i just love love love traveling i
22:03 - think that to me um
22:05 - you know gives me that exposure to how
22:07 - things are in different parts of the
22:09 - world
22:11 - um outside of that i love uh you know
22:14 - spending time with my family um i have
22:16 - two uh wonderful kids and um
22:20 - i just enjoy spending time with them
22:23 - and what else i like running um that's
22:27 - that's where i think um i can just break
22:30 - from everything else especially when
22:31 - problem solving and coding it really
22:33 - helps me to put my mind at ease you know
22:36 - when you are stuck in a problem and you
22:38 - don't know how to get past it just
22:41 - taking that break going for a quick run
22:43 - uh when the weather is
22:44 - nice and warm uh and then come back and
22:46 - then you're able to solve it so i'm not
22:49 - a
22:49 - not a runner they're doing marathons but
22:51 - i just enjoy my you know few miles here
22:54 - and there um but that's that's me
22:58 - yay such a wide variety of interest
23:00 - thanks for sharing y'all uh we have so
23:02 - many questions uh i don't know if we can
23:05 - get to all of them but
23:06 - kevin braun's class asks we are watching
23:10 - from an all-girls school in dallas texas
23:14 - puja can you share your experiences
23:16 - being a woman in a male-dominated field
23:20 - that's amazing kevin uh thanks for this
23:23 - wonderful question i would love to share
23:25 - my experiences being a woman um
23:28 - um
23:29 - you know i think it goes back to what i
23:31 - mentioned earlier is just being just
23:34 - believing in yourself that has been my
23:37 - motto uh all along doesn't mean it came
23:40 - easy
23:41 - in the beginning um you know there were
23:43 - moments where i wasn't believing in
23:44 - myself i wasn't sure what i'm doing um i
23:48 - would be in you know classes where that
23:51 - ratio was off or be the only person in
23:53 - the room um being in a male dominated
23:56 - field a lot of that has changed now
23:58 - which i'm so happy about um
24:01 - uh but it really comes down to you know
24:03 - is believing in yourself as i said
24:07 - each in software engineering
24:09 - we build products we build code that is
24:12 - used by
24:14 - uh people those people are children
24:17 - those people are women those people are
24:19 - men
24:19 - um so if if we lack that diversity when
24:23 - we're building that code we will not be
24:25 - able to be successful
24:27 - for people who are using that code
24:29 - so when i understood that and realized
24:32 - that that was it that was the point for
24:34 - me where it doesn't matter you know uh i
24:37 - need to i need to bring that unique
24:39 - perspective uh when we are coding uh
24:42 - that only i have that no one else might
24:44 - have whoever else is in the room uh and
24:47 - that holds true to you know any other
24:49 - group it doesn't it's not just true to
24:51 - being a woman in a male dominated field
24:54 - it's where you come from as i said it's
24:56 - the languages you speak
24:58 - um all of that is to me very important
25:01 - it's a sense of belonging um i'm so
25:03 - proud and happy to where the industry
25:05 - has come to today
25:07 - um and i like to give back i'd like to
25:09 - make sure that um you know i am
25:12 - accessible um to those people who feel
25:15 - that way in the beginning um or at any
25:17 - point in their career now how can
25:20 - i help and support um grow that
25:22 - community even more
25:24 - um so to me it has been i will say it's
25:27 - it's all for me it was within that how
25:29 - do i gain that confidence uh to be out
25:32 - there and give give my best and
25:34 - everything else follows
25:37 - i've had a lot of sponsors uh
25:39 - women in senior
25:41 - leadership roles that i've looked up to
25:44 - i've reached out to them i still do
25:46 - um you know i i watch a lot of videos a
25:49 - lot listen to a lot of podcasts of
25:52 - ceos of companies who are women and that
25:54 - inspires me that keeps me motivated um
25:57 - so i think that that has been my
25:59 - experience it's actually been um very
26:01 - positive uh because it's the confidence
26:04 - that helps
26:07 - great thanks y'all we have another shout
26:09 - out from five mile town college
26:12 - and they're in northern ireland and they
26:16 - say it's really useful to get the idea
26:18 - of working in i.t beyond our we country
26:21 - so uh i wanna we only have a few minutes
26:24 - left so i wanna wrap up by asking if you
26:27 - could give one piece of advice to
26:29 - students who are listening it could be
26:31 - work related or not work related what
26:33 - would it be himanshu can we start with
26:35 - you
26:38 - sure um i think uh something that has
26:41 - worked well for me is uh
26:44 - the phrase goes by ask for forgiveness
26:47 - and not permission um it's a core
26:49 - concept in python as well sorry for
26:51 - getting too geeky at times but i have
26:54 - used it a lot of times by when i'm like
26:56 - reaching out to people for help uh so
26:58 - when i was in college in my first year
27:00 - let's say or freshman as you call it um
27:03 - they were seniors like who were
27:05 - graduating or who were joining companies
27:07 - and i wanted to know like how much
27:09 - academia is going to help me and how
27:11 - what should i do in projects and whatnot
27:13 - but they they were seniors and it's very
27:16 - daunting to talk to them at
27:18 - times sorry
27:21 - am i wasting their time are they even
27:23 - interested in you know talking to me
27:26 - so i've tried to you know just
27:27 - um assume that it's okay if they don't
27:30 - want to talk to and you know i'll just
27:31 - move on and ask someone else um so yeah
27:34 - ask for forgiveness and not permission
27:37 - when it comes to you know improving
27:39 - yourself and search
27:40 - so it has worked for me so that's
27:42 - something i would like to say puja
27:44 - what's uh what's your advice
27:47 - i think the two things that i mentioned
27:49 - earlier are according to me um so have
27:51 - try to seek that clarity what you want
27:53 - to do what makes you happy and believe
27:55 - in yourself so the new one that i'll
27:57 - throw in is have fun uh enjoy the
28:00 - process um you know there's
28:02 - there's a lot to do uh in software
28:05 - engineering um uh just make sure that
28:08 - you know every time you learn something
28:09 - new every time your code fails it does
28:12 - not build
28:13 - it's it's fun it's it's that process
28:15 - that you need to enjoy and
28:18 - uh make sure you're happy when you're
28:20 - doing it so just just have fun you know
28:22 - it's uh it's a very very amazing amazing
28:25 - field software engineering and computer
28:27 - science you can have so much impact
28:29 - whether whatever you choose to do work
28:31 - at spotify work it another company work
28:34 - it you know
28:35 - nasa or wherever
28:37 - code is everywhere um
28:40 - it's just enjoy that process
28:45 - great thanks so much uh we do have one
28:47 - question more and i think we have time
28:49 - for it this is from the shorter's class
28:51 - from in greenville south carolina uh the
28:54 - question is about was it hard to adjust
28:55 - to a new country in your field when you
28:58 - had to move and get a new job and it's
29:00 - coming from a female student who is a a
29:03 - asian american i'm guessing
29:06 - yeah i can uh take that on and i know
29:08 - himanshu you also probably have
29:10 - experiences you can share is it hard
29:12 - when you move to a new country uh yes
29:15 - uh it is hard um you know it takes it
29:18 - takes some time to
29:20 - understand the different cultures the
29:22 - different ways in which people think
29:25 - communicate
29:27 - etc
29:28 - i think the biggest challenge for me was
29:31 - in the beginning i was trying to fit in
29:34 - um and that made it harder but the
29:36 - moment i realized i don't need to try to
29:38 - fit in i need to be me
29:41 - and that's what people will appreciate i
29:44 - need to be real uh because
29:46 - it's for the people here in this new
29:48 - country they want to learn from me too
29:51 - and the moment i stopped trying to fit
29:53 - in is when everything changed it became
29:55 - so easy uh on myself
29:58 - and on others and that's when i started
30:00 - building relationships um
30:03 - uh
30:03 - in in those you know the networking with
30:06 - people
30:06 - that became a lot more authentic um
30:10 - that would be my response himanshu over
30:12 - there
30:13 - sure um
30:15 - i've had like multiple experiences of
30:17 - search being in us and now in europe and
30:20 - previously in japan so i've seen like
30:22 - different types of cultures and i'm just
30:24 - i'm amazed by how different they can be
30:27 - like you know east versus west uh kind
30:29 - of thing um so one thing that has helped
30:31 - me is to actually like do my research
30:33 - you know just on the history of the
30:35 - country like why do they behave like
30:37 - this and why is it this thing is
30:39 - important to them and this thing is not
30:41 - um just talking to people from the
30:43 - origin has also helped me you know just
30:44 - get that um
30:46 - perspective so i don't take things for
30:48 - granted you know something is important
30:50 - to me doesn't mean it's also important
30:52 - to other people um so that that
30:54 - mindfulness has helped me a lot language
30:57 - is tricky um so glad that
31:00 - a lot of people in sweden speak english
31:03 - but language gets tricky and if you're
31:05 - moving to a new country definitely try
31:08 - to learn the language i think that it
31:10 - will help you a lot you know just in d
31:12 - today task and you won't
31:14 - feel like a tourist
31:16 - in in the place where you're living and
31:18 - the last thing that i am always mindful
31:20 - of is that this is
31:22 - this might be temporary so i'm not here
31:24 - and stuck here for like years and years
31:26 - and i have control of like where i want
31:28 - to live um so yeah enjoy the ride maybe
31:32 - it's maybe you'll be somewhere else in
31:33 - two years so enjoy this new country take
31:36 - it as a challenge but you know also as
31:38 - an opportunity to know something else um
31:41 - know about new culture and new people
31:44 - all right thank you we do have to wrap
31:45 - it up i do want to say that student was
31:47 - african-american not asian american so
31:48 - qualities that student but thank you
31:50 - both so much for joining and for sharing
31:52 - all of your wisdom and advice teachers
31:55 - and classes thank you all so much for
31:57 - joining
31:58 - bye
