00:02 - The Internet: Cybersecurity and Crime
00:06 - Hi, my name's Jenny Martin and I'm the
director of cyber security
00:11 - investigations at Symantec. Today
cybercrime causes huge problems for
00:16 - society personally, financially, and even
in matters of national security. Just in
00:22 - the last few years hundreds of millions
of credit card numbers have been stolen,
00:26 - tens of millions of Social Security
numbers and healthcare records were
00:30 - compromised, even nuclear centrifuges
that have been hacked, and unmanned
00:35 - aerial drones have been hijacked. This is
all done by exploiting vulnerabilities
00:40 - in hardware and software or more often
by taking advantage of unintentional
00:45 - decisions made by the people using the
software. People committing these cyber
00:53 - crimes don't a single profile or
motivation it could be anyone from an
00:57 - international terrorist to a teenager competing
for bragging rights. Today the largest
01:03 - countries not only have a regular army
but also have a well armed cyber army. In
01:08 - fact the next World War may not be
fought with traditional weapons, but with
01:12 - computers used to shut down national
water supplies, energy grids, and
01:17 - transportation systems. Hi my name is Parisa and
I'm Google Security Princess. I've worked
01:25 - on a lot of different products
and a lot of different ways to try and
01:29 - make our software as secure as possible.
01:33 - Now let's take a look at how cybercrime
works under the hood
01:36 - will learn about software viruses,
denial-of-service attacks, and phishing
01:41 - scams. In biology and life, a virus is an
organism that is spread by coughing,
01:46 - sneezing, or physical contact.
01:49 - Viruses work by infecting cells,
injecting their genetic material, and
01:53 - using those cells to replicate. They can make people really sick and then spread to other people.
01:59 - A computer virus works bit similarly. A
virus is an executable program that gets
02:04 - installed, usually unintentionally, and harms the user and their computer. It's also
02:10 - possible for a virus to spread itself to other
computers. Now how does a virus get on your
02:16 - computer in the first place? There are a
couple ways an attacker can infect someone's
02:19 - computer. They might lure a victim into
installing a program with deception about the
02:24 - program's purpose, so for example a lot
of viruses are disguised as security updates.
02:29 - It's also possible that the software on your computer has a vulnerability, so an attacker can install itself
02:35 - without even needing explicit permission.
02:39 - Once a virus is on your computer it can
steal or delete any of your files,
02:43 - control other programs, or even allow
someone else to remotely control your
02:47 - computer.
02:50 - Using computer viruses, hackers can take
over millions of computers world wide
02:55 - and then use them as a digital army, otherwise known as a botnet, to attack and take down websites.
03:01 - This kind of attack is called a
distributed denial of service.
03:07 - A denial of service is when hackers
overwhelm a website with too many
03:10 - requests. We call it a distributed
denial-of-service when the attack comes from many
03:14 - computers all at once.
03:16 - Most websites are ready to respond to
millions of requests a day, but if you
03:21 - hit them with billions or trillions of requests, coming from different places,
03:25 - the computers are overloaded and stop
responding. Another trick used by
03:31 - cybercriminals is to send large amounts of spam
email in an attempt to trick people
03:35 - into sharing sensitive personal information.
03:39 - This is called a phishing scam. A phishing scam is when you get what seems like a
03:44 - trustworthy email asking you to log
into your account, but clicking the email
03:49 - takes you to a fake website.
03:51 - if you log in anyway you've been
tricked into giving your password away.
03:55 - Hackers can then use your login
credentials to access your real accounts
04:00 - to steal information or maybe even to
steal your money. Fortunately there are
04:05 - many companies, laws, and government
organizations working to make the
04:09 - internet safer, but these efforts are
not enough.
04:14 - You may think when a computer system
gets hacked the problem was the security
04:18 - design or the software. Ninety percent
of the time the system gets hacked
04:22 - however, it's not because of the security bug, but because of a simple mistake made by
04:26 - a human. It turns out there are steps we
can all take to protect ourselves. Often
04:35 - your actions not only impact the
security of your own data and computer, but the
04:39 - security of everyone at your school,
04:41 - workplace, and home. With billions or
trillions of dollars at stake
04:46 - cybercriminals get smarter each year and
we all need to keep up.
