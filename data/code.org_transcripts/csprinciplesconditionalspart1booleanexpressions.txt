00:04 - When programming, it is often necessary
to establish whether something is true or false.
00:09 - so that a computer can make decisions about what actions
00:13 - are appropriate to take next.
00:15 - For example when deciding whether or not to provide
00:18 - voter registration information the
computer must first determine if it is
00:22 - true that the person is old enough to
vote this is something that is done
00:26 - using what programmers call a boolean
expression you can think of it like a
00:32 - yes or no question that the computer can
evaluate it's called a boolean because
00:37 - it's named after the mathematician named
George Boole who made many discoveries
00:41 - related to working with binary true or
false values in the voter registration
00:48 - example your boolean expression might
look like this this asks is the value
00:54 - stored in the variable age equal to 18
if it is then the statement is true
01:00 - otherwise the statement is false
remember the double equals is the
01:05 - Equality operator it asks if two things
are equal or not if you are using the
01:11 - single equal sign you are using the
assignment operator to set the value of
01:16 - variable which is something else
entirely in addition to the Equality
01:20 - operator we can ask questions about if
one value is greater than or less than
01:25 - another value and these are called
comparison operators if you saw the
01:30 - statement 3 less than 2 in math class
you think something was terribly wrong
01:34 - but this is still not math class in
programming you use the comparison
01:40 - operators to ask the computer question
which it can answer true or false so
01:46 - with this line the computer sees you
asking is 3 less than 2 the answer in
01:52 - this case is no or false we can use a
comparison operator in our
01:57 - voter-registration example to make the
program even more accurate because it's
02:02 - not just 18 year-olds who can vote it's
anyone whose age is 18 or older so the
02:07 - questions you'd want the computer to
evaluate should be is the users age
02:11 - greater than or equal
18 like this now that we can express the
02:22 - question we can have the computer
actually do something depending on
02:25 - whether the answer is true or false such
as displaying the registration info if
02:30 - true we'll learn more about how to do
that next
