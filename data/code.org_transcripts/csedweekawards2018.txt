JUAN LAZANO WHO IS IN THE ROOM WITH US TODAY.
02:39 - AND ENTIRE 1 MILLION TEACHERS HAVE BEGUN TEACHING
COMPUTER SCIENCE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS AS OF
02:47 - THIS WEEK.
02:49 - THE TEACHERS HAVE CHANGED THE CURRICULUM AT
THE SCHOOL LEVEL AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER
02:54 - TO CHANGE DISTRICT LEVEL POLICIES AND 46 STATES
HAVE CHANGED POLICIES TO SPREAD COMPUTER SCIENCE
03:02 - AND MAKE IT PART OF THE SCHOOL DAY AND AT
THE NATIONAL LEVEL 25 COUNTRIES HAVE MADE
03:07 - MOVES TO ADVANCE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THE
MINISTERS OF EDUCATION RELEASED THEIR DECLARATION
03:15 - OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND RECOMMENDING
INTEGRATING CODING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR
03:21 - SCHOOL DAY CURRICULUM.
03:24 - TODAY WE ARE GOING TO UNVEIL 200 NEW PLEDGES
AND COMMITMENTS TO GLOBAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
03:29 - FROM GOVERNMENTS, CITY, STATES, INDIVIDUAL
NONPROFITS AND GLOBAL ORGANIZATIONS.
03:38 - BUT FIRST I WANT TO INTRODUCE A WOMEN WHO
NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION, ONE OF THE MOST VOCAL
03:45 - SUPPORTERS FOR DIVERSITY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AND ONE OF THE GREATEST PHILANTHROPIST OF
03:52 - OUR LIFETIME, MELINDA GATES.
03:59 - AND JOINING HER I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE
MICHELLE DELGADO, A SOPHOMORE AT THAI HIGH
04:15 - SCHOOL.
04:16 - --TYEE HIGH SCHOOL.
04:19 - COME ON UP, MICHELLE.
04:23 - THIS IS MICHELLE'S FIRST COMPUTER SCIENCE
COURSE AND SHE HAS ALREADY RISEN TO THE COP
04:28 - OF HER CLASS.
04:30 - MICHELLE WILL ASK MELINDA A FEW QUESTIONS
ON HOW SHE GOT STARTED AND HOW TO ENCOURAGE
04:34 - FOLKS TO TRY CS.
04:37 - WELCOME MICHELLE TO THE STAGE.
04:38 - > FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK I LOVE
TO LEARN HOW YOU STARTED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE.
05:00 - CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT LEARNING COMPUTING?
05:04 - I WANT MICHELLE TO TELL YOU HER STORY TOO
ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED BECAUSE I THINK OUR
05:10 - STORIES ARE RELATED AND I THINK THEY ARE RELATED
FOR MANY YOUNG WOMEN FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE.
05:18 - I 
WENT TO SCHOOL AT AN ALL GIRL'S GIRL'S CATHOLIC
05:26 - HIGH SCHOOL IN DALLAS, TEXAS, AND I HAD AMAZING
TEACHERS INCLUDING A MATH TEACHER.
05:32 - HER NAME WAS MS.
05:33 - BAUER AND SHE WAS TEACHING US MATH AND SHE
WENT OFF TO A CONFERENCE AND SAW THESE BRAND
05:39 - NEW COMPUTERS.
05:40 - THEY WERE APPLE TWO.
05:42 - SHE SAID TO THE HEAD PRINCIPAL WE HAVE TO
GET THE COMPUTERS FOR THE GIRLS SO SHE CONVINCED
05:51 - THE NUN TO PUT A BUDGET FORWARD FOR FIVE COMPUTERS
FOR THE ENTIRE SCHOOL OF 600 PLUS AND HE ASKED
05:58 - US IF ANY OF US WANTED TO JOIN HER AND I SAID
SURE WHY NOT.
06:03 - I WOULD LEARN THIS NEW THING, THIS BOX.
06:05 - THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS TEACHER WAS SHE
TAPPED INTO OUR CREATIVITY AND TAUGHT US PROGRAMMING
06:11 - BY LETTING US DO THINGS WE WERE INTERESTED
IN AND SHE WAS GETTING HER FASTERS AT NIGHT
06:18 - AND SHE WAS NOT AFRAID TO LET US GET OUT AHEAD
OF HER WHICH WAS INCREDIBLE.
06:25 - THINK OF THE MESSAGE IT GAVE US.
06:27 - I GOT HOOKED AND I KNEW BY THE TIME I LEFT
HIGH SCHOOL I WANTED TO STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE
06:33 - IN COLLEGE.
06:35 - HOW DID YOU, MICHELLE, TELL EVERYBODY, GET
INTERESTED AT TYEE?
06:39 - MICHELLE GOES TO A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL HERE.
06:41 - IT ALL STARTED WHEN I WAS SMALL.
06:46 - I WOULD SEE MY DAD AND HIS COMPUTER, HE WOULD
DO WORK OR DO THINGS SO I WOULD ALWAYS BE
06:53 - CURIOUS AND THEN I WENT TO ELEMENTARY AND
MIDDLE SCHOOL.
06:57 - THERE WASN'T VERY MANY COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES
OR THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD.
07:01 - IT WASN'T UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL MY CGI TEACHER
ASKED ME DO YOU WANT TO LEARN THE BASICS OF
07:10 - COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I WAS LIKE YES, I WANT
TO LEARN MORE.
07:14 - SO I WENT TO HER CLASS AND RIGHT AWAY I LOVED
IT.
07:17 - IT IS CHALLENGING BUT I LOVED IT.
07:21 - SO THAT'S HOW I STARTED COMPUTER SCIENCE.
07:25 - YEAH AND MICHELLE IS BEING HUMBLE HERE BUT
SHE HAS RIS ON THE TOP OF HER CLASS AND YOU
07:28 - WILL TAKE THE COMPUTER SCIENCE AP, THE PRINCIPAL'S
ONE.
07:33 - THERE YOU GO.
07:36 - DID YOU EVER QUESTION YOUR DECISION TO GET
INTO TECH?
07:45 - I WOULD SAY YES, DEFINITELY.
07:47 - I THINK LOTS OF WOMEN HAVE THIS SORT OF UNDERLYING
DOUBT OF CAN I DO IT AND THAT'S TRUE IN A
07:53 - LOT OF SCIENCES.
07:54 - I QUESTIONED IT TWICE IN A DEEP WAY.
07:57 - I QUESTIONED IT IN COLLEGE BECAUSE THE PROFESSORS
WOULD THROW OUT THESE PROBLEMS WE WERE TO
08:02 - WORK ON AND SOLVE AND JUST SO YOU KNOW ABOUT
ME I LOVE PROBLEMS AND I LOVE PUZZLES SO TO
08:08 - ME THEY WERE THIS CHALLENGE BUT WHEN YOU GET
THE PROBLEM SOMETIMES LIKE IN ANY NEW FIELD
08:19 - IT SEEMS SO OVERWHELMING THAT YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO IT AND I WOULD SIT THERE AND THINK
08:23 - HOW WILL I DO THIS.
08:25 - AFTER MY FRESHMEN YEAR THERE WERE FEW WOMEN
IN MY CLASS BUT I FOUND A GUY THAT I LIKED
08:33 - TO CODE WITH.
08:34 - AND WE WOULD, YEAH, I LATER NOW TELL PEOPLE
IT'S THIS GUY THAT SET ME UP LATER TO REALIZE
08:40 - I WOULD LIKE BILL.
08:42 - HE WAS VERY WEAKY AND WE HAD A GREAT TIME
BUT WE WOULD -- GEEKY AND WE HAD A GREAT TIME.
08:54 - WE BOTH GO AWAY AND FIGURE OUT PIECES OF IT
AND COME BACK TOGETHER AND START CODING AND
09:00 - I STARTED TO FIGURE OUT WITHOUT REALIZING
IT THAT I LIKED TO CODE IN PAIRS AND TEAMS.
09:06 - AND BY THE TIME I GOT TO MY JUNIOR YEAR IN
COLLEGE THE ASSIGNMENTS WERE GIVEN AS TEAMS
09:12 - AND I ROSE UP TO BE THE LEADER OF TEAMS AND
I REALIZED I LIKE TO MANAGE TEAMS.
09:16 - SO I QUESTIONED IT DEEPLY IN COLLEGE.
09:19 - IF I HAD NOT FOUND THAT PERSON TO CODE WITH
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE HAD THE CONFIDENCE
09:23 - TO STAY.
09:24 - I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I HAVE A DAUGHTER
WHO IS STUDYING TO GO TO MED SCHOOL.
09:29 - SHE SAID FRESHMEN YEAR IN COLLEGE SHE ALMOST
GAVE UP HER DREAM OF GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL
09:34 - BECAUSE CHEMISTRY WAS SO HARD BUT WHEN SHE
GOT A TEAM TOGETHER TO WORK ON THE PROBLEMS
09:41 - SHE KNEW SHE COULD GO ON.
09:43 - SO THE IDEA OF A TEAM WHO YOU ARE SURROUNDED
BY OTHER MEN AND WOMEN AND YOU HAVE TO PERSIST
09:50 - AND PUSH THROUGH.
09:52 - THAT'S WHAT YOU DO AS TEACHERS IS INSPIRE.
09:57 - THE LAST STORY I WILL TELL WONDERING IF I
SHOULD STAY, NOT WONDERING IF I SHOULD STAY
10:00 - IN TECHNOLOGY BUT WHEN I GOT TO MAKE ARE YOU
SOFT I WAS USED TO WORKING AROUND LOT OF GUYS
10:07 - BUT THE CULTURE WAS MORE I WILL JUST SAY VERY
ROUGH AND TUMBLE AND I KNEW HOW TO DO THAT,
10:17 - I COULD SEE HOW THE GAME WAS AND I KNEW HOW
TO PLAY BUT TWO YEARS IN I WAS NOT HAPPY AND
10:24 - I WAS NOT TURNING INTO THE PERSON I WANTED
TO BE.
10:27 - I THOUGHT I HAD THIS JOB OFFER FROM MKENZIE.
10:33 - I LOVED CREATING PRODUCT AND THE INNOVATION
AND THE PEOPLE I WAS AROUND AT MICROSOFT.
10:41 - SO I DECIDED TO TAKE A TACT FOR MYSELF WHICH
WAS I COULD LEAVE OR TRY BEING MYSELF.
10:47 - AND I TRIED BEING MYSELF AND IT WORKED.
10:50 - AND I STARTED ATTRACTING PEOPLE WHO WANTED
TO WORK IN THE SAME CULTURE THAT TYEE WANTED
10:55 - TO -- WANTED TO WORK IN THE SAME CULTURE SO
WHEN I LEARNED THAT ABOUT MYSELF I WAS HAPPIER
11:01 - AND I STAYED.
11:02 - ONE THING WE NEED TO DO FOR WOMEN IS SURROUND
THEM WITH OTHER LIKE MINDED MEN AND WOMEN
11:09 - AND WE KNOW WOMEN WILL PERSIST IF THEY SEE
COLLEAGUES THAT ARE SUPPORTING AND THEY SUPPORT
11:16 - THEM.
11:17 - WOMEN IN ALL FIELDS ARE BETTER- OFF IF THEY
HAVE WOMEN COLLEAGUES BUT THIS IS A REASON
11:21 - WE ARE STUCK IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IS WOMEN
DON'T SEE MANY ROLE MODELS AND THEY DON'T
11:27 - SEE IT BEING WELCOMING AND THEY WONDER WILL
THEY HAVE ANOTHER WOMAN ON THEIR TEAM BUT
11:33 - IF YOU PUT MORE WOMEN ON THEIR TIME THEY WERE
PERSIST AND THIS IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT
11:39 - TO GET MORE WOMEN INTO TECH.
11:43 - THAT'S VERY GOOD.
11:44 - SO HOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN ENCOURAGE MORE
WOMEN AND UNDER REPRESENTATIVED MINORITIES
11:49 - TO TRY COMPUTER SCIENCE.
11:52 - I THINK IT IS TEACHERS, THAT REMINDING KIDS
ANY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW IT IS HARD
12:04 - AND GIVING THEM THEIR CONFIDENCE TO PERSIST
BUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THOUSANDS MORE
12:11 - TEACHERS LIKE YOU I LOVE WHAT NEW YORK CITY
IS DOING WHERE THEY HAVE A GOAL OF COMPUTER
12:17 - SCIENCE FOR ALL AND BY 2025 THEY WILL HAVE
TRAINED ENOUGH TEACHERS, THEY WILL TRAIN 5,000
12:22 - TEACHERS SO EVERY KID IS EXPOSED TO COMPUTER
SCIENCE DURING THERE K-12 TIME.
12:30 - WE NEED TO EXPOSE KIDS AND THEN WE NEED TO
WORK ON THE TRANSITIONS, THE PATHWAYS INTO
12:35 - COLLEGE.
12:36 - WHEN A YOUNG GIRL GETS INTO COLLEGE SHE WILL
SEE THERE ARE A LOT OF GUYS AND THEY ARE PRETTY
12:43 - FAR ALONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF
CODING ALREADY SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE AT THE
12:50 - ENTRY COURSE MORE WELCOMING AND MAKE THE PROBLEM
SET INTERESTING TO GIRLS AND HAVE ASSOCIATE
12:54 - PROFESSORS WHO ARE WOMEN, YOU NEED TO MAKE
SURE WOMEN ARE SURROUNDED IN TEAMS.
13:01 - WE ARE SEEING PROGRESS IN A BUNCH OF UNIVERSITIES,
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, HARVEY, SEVERAL
13:07 - OTHERS -- HARVARD, SEVERAL OTHERS SO WE HAVE
TO DO MORE AT K-12 FOR SURE LIKE CODE.
13:17 - ORG TO MAKE SURE KIDS ARE WELCOME AND MAKE
THE TRANSITION INTO COLLEGE GO SMOOTHER AND
13:24 - EASIER FOR WOMEN.
13:28 - THE NUMBER OF WOMEN CS DEGREES WAS 37% WHEN
I GRADUATED.
13:34 - WE THOUGHT WE WERE ON THE RISE.
13:38 - YOU LOOK AT LAW AND MEDICINE THEY ARE AT 5050.
13:41 - LAW IS JUST SLIGHTLY SURPASSING MORE WOMEN
THAN MEN.
13:44 - AT CS WE ARE AT 19%.
13:48 - FOR A DECADE WE HELD AROUND 18 TO 20% OF CS
GRADUATES AS WOMEN.
13:54 - WHEN YOU IN THE CASE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY --THINK
ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND HOW PERVASIVE IT IS AND
14:01 - THE AMAZING THINGS WE ARE DOING AND WHERE
WE ARE GOING, I COULD NOT HAVE DREAMED OF
14:08 - A PHONE IN MY POCKET THAT HAD THAT MUCH COMPUTING
POWER.
14:11 - SO THIS IS PERVASIVE.
14:13 - THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST JOBS.
14:16 - THEY ARE SUPER INNOVATIVE.
14:18 - WOMEN HAVE A LOT OF CREATIVITY AND A LOT OF
THINGS TO CONTRIBUTE SO WE HAVE TO WORK ON
14:23 - THIS PROBLEM AND WE HAVE TO MAKE --WE HAVE
TO BEND THE CURVE AND NOT MAKE INCREMENTAL
14:30 - CHANGES, WE HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
SO ANY IDEAS FUNNEL THEM TO ME BECAUSE I AM
14:38 - OPEN.
14:39 - WE HAVE GOT TO GET WOMEN INTO THIS FIELD.
14:44 - SO WHAT ROLE CAN COMPANIES PLAY TO ACCOMPLISH
THIS?
14:47 - I THINK A LOT OF THINGS WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES
DO, OFFERING INCREDIBLE INTERNSHIPS IN THE
14:53 - SUMMERS, HELPING TRAIN MORE TEACHERS AND HELPING
POINT TOWARDS ONLINE COMMUNITIES AND TEACHERS
14:59 - ALSO NEED SUPPORT.
15:00 - WE KNOW PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY
IMPORTANT.
15:04 - YOU NEED A LEARNING COMMUNITY AROUND YOU WHEN
YOU TEACH THE NEW AP COMPUTER SCIENCE PRINCIPALS
15:13 - CLASS.
15:14 - YOU NEED TOOLS TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO TEACH
THAT DIFFERENTLY THAN MAYBE I HAVE TAUGHT
15:18 - COMPUTER SCIENCE BEFORE OR WHAT OTHER TEACHER
HAS A GREAT IDEA FOR BRINGING IN MORE YOUNG
15:23 - WOMEN OR UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES.
15:29 - WE HAVE TO CREATE THE LEARNING COMMUNITIES
FOR TEACHERS AND I THINK INDUSTRY HAS A ROLE
15:35 - TO PLAY IN THAT AS WELL.
15:37 - WE ALL DO.
15:38 - IT IS GOING TO TAKE OTHER TEACHERS AND INDUSTRY
AND GOVERNMENT.
15:42 - IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US TO PUSH THIS FIELD
FORWARD.
15:45 - TO WRAP UP ON A FUN NOTE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
A FAVORITE COMPUTER RELATED TELEVISION OR
15:53 - BOOK?
15:54 - WHAT I CALL MIND CANDY NIGHT BILL AND I LOVE
TO WATCH SILICON VALLEY AND WE ARE NOT ALLOWED
16:02 - TO GO ON IN THE SERIES IF THE OTHER ONE IS
NOT HOME AND TRAVELING BECAUSE WE HAVE SO
16:07 - MUCH FUN WATCHING IT TOGETHER.
16:08 - ALL THE INSIDE JOKES WE LOVE.
16:12 - THANK YOU, MICHELLE.
16:19 - YOU'RE WELCOME.
16:24 - NOW I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE HADI BACK ON STAGE
AND JAKE BASKIN.
16:32 - THEY WILL PRESENT THE 2018 CS CHAMPIONS AWARD
BUT AN AWARD IS NOT AN AWARD UNLESS YOU GET
16:40 - HIGH FIVES FROM A BUNCH OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS.
16:42 - SO WE HAVE SOUTH SHORE MIDDLE SCHOOL HERE.

AND SCIENCE EXPO.
19:57 - WHITE BECAME CERTIFIED IN CS TO SHARE HER
KNOWLEDGE WITH OTHER TEACHES AND STUDENTS.
20:05 - SEASIDE HIGH SCHOOL CONCEIVED OF HIS VISION
FOR CS EDUCATION.
20:09 - AT THE TIME A NEARBY UNIVERSITY WAS OFFERING
SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN
20:15 - COMPUTER SCIENCE.
20:21 - SEASIDE NOTICED NONE OF THEIR STUDENTS WERE
GOING INTO THIS PROGRAM SO THEY SET OUT TO
20:27 - CHANGE THAT.
20:28 - TODAY SEASIDE HIGH SCHOOL HAS 6135 STUDENTS
ENROLLED IN A COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS AND MORE
20:35 - IMPORTANTLY THE CLASS CHARACTERIZE REFLECT

22:14 - THE FIRST IS LINCOLN PUBLIC SCHOOL.
22:17 - THEY HAVE A GOAL OF 5050 BY 2020 MEANING CS
CLASSES SHOULD BE COMPRISED OF AN EVEN SPLIT
22:23 - BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS.
22:27 - TEACHERS DISCUSS GOALS AND GO TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO RECRUIT STUDENTS TO THEIR COMPUTER SCIENCE
22:32 - CLASSES INCLUDING BRINGING IN GUEST SPEAKER
AND FREQUENTLY DISCUSSING FAMOUS PEOPLE AND
22:36 - WOMEN IN CS AND 
ONE TEACHER HAND WROTE 50 LETTERS INDIVIDUALLY
22:46 - TO THE GIRLS SHE THOUGHT SHOULD TAKE HER CLASS.
22:50 - SO LINCOLN WILL COME ON STAGE.
22:52 - THE OTHER GROUP IS GIRLS COTING WITH GIRLS
-- CODING WITH GIRLS.
22:58 - WHEN ADESOLA SANUSI AND HER MENTOR DEVELOPED
A PLAN, THIS PROGRAM WAS SO SUCCESSFUL AFTER
23:11 - SANUSI GRADUATED IT CONTINUED.
23:13 - FOR FIVE YEARS STUDENTS HAVE GROWN AND GONE
ON TO BECOME MENTORS AND THEY HAVE 250 PARTICIPANTS.
23:21 - THE CLUB HOPES TO CONTINUE TO INSPIRE GIRLS
TO GET INVOLVED IN CS, PARTICULARLY THROUGH
23:26 - THEIR OUTREACH TO ELEMENTARY STUDENTS.
23:29 - CAN KENT STEEN FROM LINCOLN PUBLIC SCHOOLS
AND ADESOLA JOIN ME ON STAGE AND CAN Y'ALL

24:06 - THEY HAVE A LOT OF LIFETIME LEFT SO WE WILL
CALL THIS THE EXPANDING CS OPPORTUNITIES AWARD.
24:17 - IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO ANNOUNCE THIS AWARD.
24:20 - THE COMPUTER SCIENCE EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES
AWARD.
24:24 - I AM SO PLEASED TO GIVE THIS AWARD TODAY BECAUSE
NOT ONLY IS IT THE BEGINNING OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
24:30 - EDUCATION WEEK BUT IT IS INTERNATIONAL PERSON'S
DISABILITY DAY AND I THINK THESE TWO IDEAS
24:36 - COMING TOGETHER IS WHAT THIS AWARD IS ALL
ABOUT.
24:40 - RICHARD LADNER AND ANDREA STEFIK PARTNERED
TOGETHER TO CREATE ACCESS FOR ALL AND THEIR
24:47 - GOAL WAS TO CREATE ONLINE COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT
FOR TEACHERS WHO WERE HELPING STUDENTS WHO
24:56 - HAD DISABILITIES.
24:59 - WHEN ANDREAS LOOKED IN THE MARKET HE AND HIS
WIFE SAW THERE WAS NOT MUCH THERE TERMS OF
25:05 - COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES,
VISUAL OR HEARING DISABILITIES AND THEY WANTED
25:10 - TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO THEY STARTED A
PROGRAM CALLED QUORUM, IT WAS BORN ACCESSIBLE
25:17 - WHICH I THINK IS REALLY NEAT.
25:18 - THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PRIMARY DESIGN GOAL
WHEN IT CAME OUT IN 2009.
25:24 - THEY HAVE TAKEN IT SO MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT.
25:28 - THIS AWARD IS GOING TO RICHARD AND HIS ENTIRE
TEAM, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW NINE PEOPLE STRONG,
25:34 - THEY ARE ON VERSION SIX, AND IT IS BEING USED
FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF PURPOSES, 300,000 PROGRAMS
25:42 - HAVE NOW BEEN WRITTEN ON QUORUM.
25:45 - RICHARD, STEFIK AND THE QUORUM TEAM, WILL
YOU PLEASE JOIN ME ON STAGE.
25:59 - WOW.
26:10 - WE ARE ALL INSPIRED BY THESE WINNERS.
26:45 - I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THE
AWARDS AND THANK YOU TO THE HIGH FIVE TUNNEL.
27:00 - I WANT TO LOOK AT THE MOMENTUM GOING FORWARD.
27:03 - THIS YEAR WE HAD OVER 30 STATES PASS MORE
THAN 60 POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
27:09 - AND LOOKING FORWARD TO A 2019 WE ALREADY HAD
FIVE GOVERNORS PLEDGE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR
27:16 - COMPUTER SCIENCE.
27:18 - BY VIDEO I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE GOVERNOR
OF WASHINGTON WHO WILL MAKE A SPECIAL PLEDGE
27:23 - TO KICK US OFF.
27:24 - HOLA, HOWDY AND HI.
27:28 - I'M THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON
AND TODAY I AM EXCITED TO KICKOFF COMPUTER
27:37 - SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK.
27:39 - I MADE COMPUTER SCIENCE A PRIORITY SINCE I
HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR AND I BELIEVE EVERY STUDENT
27:46 - SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THIS
21ST CENTURY SUBJECT SO THIS YEAR I AM CALLING
27:52 - ON EVERY STUDENT IN OUR STATE TO TRY COMPUTER
SCIENCE AND COMPLETE ONE HOUR OF CODE.
27:58 - THAT'S OVER 1 MILLION HOURS OF CODING.
28:02 - AND AS THE COACHER OF THE GOVERNORS FOR K-12
COMPUTER SCIENCE PARTNERSHIP I WOULD LIKE
28:08 - TO WELCOME THE PLEDGES FROM OTHER GOVERNORS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THEY COMMIT TO EXPANDING
28:13 - COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR ALL STUDENTS.
28:17 - LET'S GO CODE.

PROGRAM AND HE AND MICROSOFT HAVE BEEN LEADERS
37:47 - IN SUPPORTING CS EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS OF
ALL AGES.
37:51 - PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING BRAD SMITH.
37:55 - GOOD MORNING.
37:59 - IT'S A PLEASURE FOR ME TO BE HERE ON BEHALF
OF MICROSOFT BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT
38:09 - EVENT AND THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL WEEK.
38:13 - SO MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS
FOR SO MANY YEARS AND WHAT WE ARE HERE TO
38:19 - TALK ABOUT AND DO ASK SOMETHING THAT REALLY
MATTERS AND CONNECTS THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD
38:26 - AND THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY WITH OPPORTUNITIES
FOR PEOPLE.
38:30 - ESPECIALLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
BECAUSE WHAT WE ALL SEE EVERYDAY, THE WORLD
38:36 - IS CHANGING.
38:38 - ALREADY HALF OF THE JOBS THE UNITED STATES
REQUIRE THAT SOMEONE GO TO WORK POSSESSING
38:44 - DIGITAL SKILLS.
38:46 - AND THAT NUMBER WILL GROW.
38:47 - IT WILL HIT 77% IN THE NEXT DECADE.
38:51 - AND YET WE ALSO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE.
38:54 - MOST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES
HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE
39:01 - THOSE DIGITAL SKILLS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO LEARNING COMPUTER SCIENCE.
39:07 - IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS MOVEMENT THAT
WE ARE NOW PART OF AS PART OF THE HOUR OF
39:12 - CODE AND CODE.
39:13 - ORG STARTED JUST FIVE YEARS AGO.
39:17 - BUT WHEN YOU REACH THE FIVE YEAR MILESTONE
LIKE WE HAVE TODAY, I THINK IT INVOLVES AN
39:22 - OPPORTUNITY, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO STEP BACK
AND LOOK BACK BUT ALSO LOOK FORWARD.
39:29 - I REMEMBER FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE HOUR OF
CODE WAS JUST A TWINKLE IN THE EYE OF HADI
39:36 - PARTOVI.
39:38 - I KNOW BECAUSE AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW HADI'S
HOUSE IS NEXT DOOR TO MY HOUSE.
39:46 - AT THE TOP OF THE HILL WE SHARE A COMMON DRIVEWAY.
39:50 - I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE INTO THE GARAGE AT NIGHT
IF HE IS STANDING IN THE WAY.
39:55 - WELL, ACTUALLY I CAN BUT RUNNING HIM OVER
IS NOT THE RIGHT PATH.
40:01 - I REMEMBER FIVE YEARS AGO HE WAS OUT IN HIS
DRIVEWAY AND HE SAID I HAVE AN IDEA.
40:09 - THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT WE CAN
HELP SOLVE.
40:12 - BECAUSE FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE THEY LOOK AT THESE
OPPORTUNITIES AND THEY DON'T APPRECIATE ANYBODY
40:20 - CAN ASPIRE TO BE THE NEXT MELINDA GATES OR
THE NEXT JEFF BEZOS OR MARK ZUCKERBURG.
40:30 - WHAT THEY DESERVE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN
THIS FUNDAMENTAL FIELD AND IT WAS HADI'S GENIUS
40:39 - THAT SAID HERE IS A NEW PATH AND AT THAT TIME
FIVE YEARS AGO THERE WERE ONLY NINE STATES
40:48 - OUT OF 50 THAT EVEN ALLOWED A STUDENT WHO
TOOK COMPUTER SCIENCE TO HAVE THAT COURSE
40:56 - COUNT TOWARDS THE MATH OR SCIENCE GRADUATION
REQUIREMENT.
41:00 - ONLY NINE STATES.
41:03 - AND SO HERE WE ARE, FIVE YEARS LATER, AND
LOOK WHERE WE ARE.
41:09 - THAT NUMBER OF NINE STATES HAS GROWN TO 44.
41:13 - JUST IN THE LAST YEAR, 33 STATES HAVE PASSED
NEW TYPES OF LAWS TO ADVANCE COMPUTER SCIENCE.
41:20 - NOT JUST MAKING IT COUNT, BUT 19 OF THOSE
STATES HAVE PUT NEW FUNDING COMMITMENTS BEHIND
41:26 - THEM.
41:27 - YOU SAW IT HERE, WHETHER ITS ALABAMA OR ARKANSAS
OR MISSOURI OR MONTANA OR WASHINGTON, THIS
41:34 - HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S A
GREAT THING.
41:38 - BUT THIS MOVEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT A
FEW OTHER THINGS.
41:43 - THE FIRST HAS BEEN GETTING PARENTS EXCITED.
41:47 - WHICH ACTUALLY PROVED TO BE RELATIVELY EASY.
41:50 - PARENTS GETS IT.
41:51 - EVERY SURVEY SHOWS 90% OF PARENTS WANT THEIR
CHILDREN TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN
41:57 - COMPUTER SCIENCE.
41:59 - OF COURSE IT HAS TO MOVE FROM PARENTS INTO
THE SCHOOLS AND THAT REQUIRES NOT JUST THE
42:04 - SUPPORT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE SUPPORT
OF GOVERNORS, IT REALLY CALLS ON THE PEOPLE
42:10 - WHO MATTER MOST WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION.
42:14 - TEACHERS.
42:15 - AND THAT'S WHERE TEACHERS HAVE STEPPED FORWARD
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD.
42:21 - THEY HAVE VOLUNTEERED THEIR TIME, THEY HAVE
TAKEN ON THE NEED TO LEARN NEW SKILLS.
42:25 - THERE ARE 87,000 TEACHERS THAT HAVE WORKED
WITH CODE.
42:31 - ORG OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS.
42:34 - THAT IS HOW YOU BUILD A MOVEMENT THAT YOU
CAN SUSSTAIN.
42:40 - AND OF COURSE ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT STUDENTS
THEMSELVES AND IN THE WORLD OF CHANGE CODE.
42:49 - ORG IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN.
42:51 - WHEN YOU CONSIDER OVER 650 MILLION PEOPLE
HAVE TAKEN THE HOUR OF CODE, THAT IS SIMPLY
43:00 - EXTRAORDINARY AND WE ARE VERY PROUD AT MICROSOFT
THAT WE JUST PASSED THE POINT WHERE 100 MILLION
43:07 - OF THOSE STUDENTS TOOK THE HOUR OF CODE SESSION
ON MINE CRAFT, ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS.
43:15 - WE ARE EXCITED.
43:21 - WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS,
ALL OF US HAVE, BY WORKING TOGETHER.
43:27 - I THINK WE FIRST HAD TO LEARN HOW TO REACH
PEOPLE, HOW TO TRAIN TEACHES, HOW TO TRAIN
43:32 - TEACHERS AT A LOWER COST AND A FACTOR REACH.
43:35 - WE HAVE --FATHER REACH.
43:36 - WE ALSO LEARNED THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT NUMBERS
BUT IT'S ABOUT DIVERSITY BECAUSE SO MUCH OF
43:45 - WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS FUTURE ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE.
43:50 - IT'S NOT JUST THAT THESE JOBS THAT INVOLVE
DIGITAL SKILLS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET FILLED
43:55 - IF THERE ARE PEOPLE TRAINED TO FILL THEM,
THEY PAY BETTER.
43:59 - AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THOSE JOBS ARE JOBS
THAT CAN BE PURSUED BY EVERYBODY.
44:05 - THAT'S WHY IT SO IMPORTANT ASTHMA LINDA WAS
SAYING --AS MELINDA WAS SAYING WE DO EVERYTHING
44:10 - WE CAN TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG
GIRLS AND WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IT
44:18 - TAKES A VILLAGE TO DO THAT.
44:21 - IT TAKES A VILLAGE OF DIFFERENT NONPROFIT
GROUPS AND WE AT MICROSOFT ARE EXCITED BY
44:26 - THE RANGE OF NONPROFIT GROUPS WE SUPPORT LIKE
GIRLS WHO CODE AND DIGI GIRLS AND BLACK GIRL
44:32 - CODES AND TECH CHICA AND OTHERS.
44:35 - THEY ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT.
44:38 - THE OTHER THING WE LEARN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT
DIVERSITY, WHEN WE REACH GIRLS AND PEOPLE
44:42 - OF COLOR IS THERE IS NO ORGANIZATION THAT
WILL REACH MORE DIVERSE PEOPLE THAN CODE.
44:49 - ORG BECAUSE CODE.
44:51 - ORG FOCUSES ON DIVERSITY AT A SCALE THAT IS
DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMAGINE.
44:57 - 15 MILLION GIRLS ARE INVOLVED IN CODE.
45:01 - ORG RELATED COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES THIS
YEAR, THIS WEEK IN K-12 CLASSES ACROSS THIS
45:08 - COUNTRY.
45:09 - AND OF COURSE WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THE VILLAGE
NEEDS TO EXTEND BEYOND THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY
45:14 - TO THE TECH SECTOR AS WELL.
45:17 - THERE IS SO MANY DAYS WHEN PEOPLE GUT UP THE
MORN --GET UP IN THE MORNING AND THEY COMPETE
45:21 - WITH EACH OTHER.
45:23 - ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THIS EFFORT
IS THAT IT BRINGS US ALL TOGETHER, WHETHER
45:29 - ITS AMAZON AND MICROSOFT OR GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK
WE ALL SIT AROUND THE TABLE TOGETHER.
45:39 - WE DONATE MONEY TOGETHER AND WE WORK TODAY
AND WITH HADI AND OTHER GROUPS AND THAT IS
45:46 - WHAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE FOR US TO DO
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
45:52 - THIS WORK WILL TAKE MORE THAN ANOTHER FIVE
YEARS, IT MAY TAKE ANOTHER DECADE AND IN SOME
45:56 - COUNTRIES IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN THAT BUT
THE FUTURE COURSE IS CLEAR AT THIS POINT.
46:02 - WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH, WE MASTERSERED SO
MANY TECHNIQUES, NOW WE NEED TO KEEP DOING
46:07 - IT AND EXPANDING FARTHER EACH AND EVERY YEAR.
46:11 - FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN HADI WAS STANDING IN OUR
DRIVEWAY I AGREED TOGETHER WITH OTHERS MICROSOFT
46:19 - WOULD BECOME THE FIRST FUNDER AND ONE OF THE
FIRST FOUNDERS OF CODE.
46:24 - ORG.
46:25 - SO IN THE BASIS OF THAT WE COMMITTED $25 MILLION.
46:30 - WE GOT INVOLVED.
46:31 - WE CONNECTED CODE.
46:32 - ORG WITH OTHER EXCITING WORK WE DO.
46:39 - BUT WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZED THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD DO FOR FIVE YEARS AND SIMPLY
46:44 - STOP.
46:45 - IN FACT NOW IS A MORE EXCITING TIME THAN EVER
BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUT THE CHALLENGES
46:51 - REMAIN AND THIS MORNING WE HAVE BEEN EXCITED
TO ANNOUNCE WE ARE PUTTING ANOTHER $10 MILLION
46:58 - INTO THE FUEL TANK OF CODE.
47:11 - ORG.
47:16 - THAT'S EXCITING BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE MONEY
TO DO THIS WORK.
47:21 - BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS FOR EVERY PERSON
WHO WORKS FOR CODE.
47:25 - ORG AND FOR EVERYBODY WHO WORKS AT A TECH
COMPANY, FOR EVERYBODY LIKE MELINDA WHO LEADS
47:29 - OR WORKS AT AN IMPORTANT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,
WE WILL NEED TO KEEP DOING WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
47:37 - DOING.
47:38 - BUT THE TRUTH OF THE IS WE ARE NOT THE ONES
--MATTER IS, WE ARE NOT THE ONES WHO WILL
47:42 - HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT, IT'S THE TEACHERS
OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD THAT WILL MAKE
47:48 - THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE STUDENTS: IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE TEACHERS.
48:05 - SO IN CLOSING I WANT TO SAY THE TEACHERS OF
THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD CAN COUNT ON OUR
48:10 - SUPPORT BUT WE IN TURN ARE LOOKING TO YOU
AND TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT
48:17 - HAVE TAKEN US FORWARD IN THE PAST, THEY ARE
THE UNWITHS WHO WILL TAKE US FORWARD AGAIN
48:19 - AND WITH --THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WILL TAKE
US FORWARD AGAIN AND WITH TEACHER AFTER TEACHER,
48:26 - SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL AND STATE AFTER STATE
AND COUNTRY AFTER TOGETHER WE WILL CREATE
48:32 - THE FOUNDATION THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF
PEOPLE DESERVES.
48:36 - THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
48:50 - THANK YOU, BRAD.
48:51 - AND I WANT TO ONE LAST TIME BEFORE WE END,
THANK ALL OF THE DONORS WHO MADE THIS POSSIBLE.
48:56 - I WANT TO CALL OUT MICROSOFT, FACEBOOK, AMAZON
AND INFOSYS AND THANK YOU TO CSTA FOR THE
49:03 - AWARDS AND FOR THE PAUL ALAN SCHOOL OF COMPUTER
SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING WHO ARE HOSTING US
