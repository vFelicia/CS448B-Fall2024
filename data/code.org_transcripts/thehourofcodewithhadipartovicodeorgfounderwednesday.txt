00:01 - hi there uh those 17 classrooms already
00:05 - on there okay there's now 21. uh there's
00:09 - a bunch of you that are uh that can
00:11 - actually get into the hangout to join us
00:13 - if you want to be able to join into the
00:15 - hangout I know there's two URLs but if
00:17 - you're watching this on YouTube
00:18 - streaming that works great uh but I
00:21 - would love if you if any of the
00:22 - classrooms joining can find a way to
00:24 - actually join into the hangout so we can
00:26 - hear questions live uh there's now
00:30 - already 30 classrooms all watching this
00:33 - together uh yesterday when we did a
00:35 - stream like this we had 100 classrooms
00:36 - all at the same time uh I wanted to
00:39 - welcome all of you there at out
00:41 - throughout the country and even beyond
00:43 - that are doing the hour of code this
00:45 - week uh welcome to the third day of
00:47 - Computer Science Education week I'm here
00:49 - in New York City uh by the way my name
00:51 - is Hadi partovy I'm the creator of the
00:53 - hour of code uh you know this has been
00:55 - an amazing week uh this week the hour of
00:59 - code turned three years old at this
01:03 - whole campaign started as just a simple
01:05 - idea I had that you know computer
01:06 - science is changing our world it's
01:08 - changing everything around us from the
01:11 - phones we use or the computers we use
01:13 - all the way to how entertainment works
01:15 - and how communication works and how
01:16 - banking works and transportation yet our
01:19 - schools don't teach it at and code.org
01:22 - started with the vision that every
01:23 - school every student in every school
01:26 - should be able to learn computer science
01:27 - and the way this idea really spread the
01:30 - most has been through creating the idea
01:32 - of an hour of code and asking every
01:34 - student in every school in every country
01:36 - to try at least just one hour of coding
01:38 - and computer science
01:40 - that idea is now three years old in just
01:43 - three years we've managed to have 300
01:46 - million hours of code get done that's
01:49 - unbelievable in terms of the number of
01:51 - students participating in this and the
01:53 - students doing the hour of code around
01:54 - the entire world have written 20 billion
01:57 - lines of code it's just an unbelievable
02:00 - achievement to have done that and it's
02:02 - really thanks to you to classrooms like
02:04 - yourselves the teachers that are have
02:06 - been hosting the hour of code and the
02:07 - students participating it at this
02:10 - morning we rang the opening of the stock
02:12 - market in New York city so the NASDAQ
02:14 - stock market I had the wonderful
02:16 - opportunity to ring the bell to open the
02:18 - stock market and I'm here in New York
02:20 - City right now you can see Times Square
02:23 - right down there
02:25 - for my room up here uh but I just wanted
02:28 - to say thank you to everybody who
02:30 - supported this campaign and especially
02:33 - thank you to the teachers who have been
02:35 - so gracious to to open your classroom
02:37 - you know whether you're an English
02:38 - teacher or a math teacher or a history
02:40 - teacher or a tech teacher or a computer
02:43 - science teacher so many of you have
02:45 - decided to add coding and computer
02:47 - science at least just for one hour and
02:49 - in many cases for an entire week into
02:51 - your classroom and into your school uh
02:54 - you know my hat's off to you the
02:55 - teachers of this country and even the
02:57 - entire world who have made this campaign
02:59 - a reality deserve a huge round of
03:01 - applause so the students who are there
03:03 - make sure you you all give a round of
03:05 - applause for your teachers and thank
03:07 - them for introducing you to coding and
03:09 - computer science
03:10 - uh I want to jump to a few questions and
03:14 - I have a number of questions that people
03:16 - are going to be asking over the uh
03:19 - over basically you know the the comments
03:21 - in the YouTube so if you have any
03:22 - questions please type them in in there
03:24 - and and uh I'll get them and then read
03:27 - them from here
03:30 - at
03:33 - the
03:34 - first question I want to start with is a
03:37 - sixth grader from Alex sixth grader
03:39 - named Alexis in Oakland
03:41 - said I want to be a doctor when I grow
03:44 - up how will learning things like the
03:46 - hour of code help me learn how to be a
03:47 - better doctor
03:49 - this is a fantastic question because you
03:51 - know I often get asked does everybody
03:54 - need to learn how to code you know not
03:56 - everybody you know learns how to be a
03:58 - mechanic you know only the people who
04:00 - want to do that need to do that and the
04:02 - difference with coding in computer
04:03 - science is computers and technology and
04:06 - software are changing absolutely
04:07 - everything that you don't just learn to
04:10 - code to become a doctor you learn how
04:12 - computers work because computers are
04:14 - changing medicine computers are going to
04:16 - be changing Transportation they're going
04:19 - to be changing agriculture you know and
04:21 - the future of medicine in particular is
04:23 - deeply linked with technology today when
04:25 - you go to see a doctor they look inside
04:27 - your ear they look inside your eye they
04:29 - they bang on your knee to see how things
04:31 - are going
04:31 - the future is going to be you know
04:33 - taking a pinprick and having a computer
04:35 - analyze exactly what's in your blood and
04:37 - telling you what's wrong with that so if
04:39 - you want to be a doctor in the future
04:40 - understanding how that technology Works
04:43 - what's the algorithm like what's the
04:44 - data how's the data being analyzed what
04:47 - are the cyber security implications all
04:49 - those things are relevant no matter what
04:51 - field you want to go into
04:55 - my my next question
04:57 - is from an 8th grader Kayla in
05:00 - Cincinnati
05:01 - uh asking what's been the best thing for
05:04 - you about learning to code uh
05:07 - and you know for this uh there's a
05:09 - personal question you know I started
05:10 - learning to code when I was about 10
05:11 - years old and I fell in love with it
05:14 - immediately it was just such a great
05:16 - thing to be able to do and the thing I
05:18 - love about writing code and coding has
05:20 - been
05:21 - the fact that when you write that you
05:23 - can create whatever you want and that
05:25 - you can get the computer to do what you
05:26 - want and then you can have it do it as
05:28 - many times as you wanted it you know so
05:31 - it just means your imagination doesn't
05:33 - need to have any limits it's one of the
05:35 - only things where you're not limited on
05:38 - a canvas to just a certain size your
05:40 - canvas is as big as the entire world
05:42 - really that and the fact that you can
05:44 - create something like the you know the
05:47 - Minecraft tutorial that we built with
05:48 - Microsoft that has now had over 30
05:51 - million people try that at you know that
05:54 - the team that got to do that it's fun to
05:56 - make it and but it's especially fun to
05:58 - see it's spread throughout the world so
06:01 - the creativity and the impact are what I
06:03 - like the most
06:05 - all right the next question comes from a
06:07 - second grader named Chase in Gwinnett
06:09 - County Georgia
06:11 - saying sometimes I get stuck and I need
06:13 - help can you help me at
06:16 - but the answer I'd say you know
06:18 - everybody gets stuck with coding um you
06:20 - know computer science and coding are
06:22 - very different than many other fields
06:24 - and that you know in math there's a
06:27 - right answer and a wrong answer and if
06:28 - you get it wrong then you're wrong
06:30 - there's no alternative you're either
06:32 - right or you're wrong in computer
06:33 - science and when you're writing code
06:36 - you're always making mistakes on your
06:39 - way to getting the right answer in other
06:40 - words very few people write the perfect
06:43 - code the very very first time with no
06:45 - mistakes and it's done it's always got a
06:47 - mistake here a little mistake there a
06:48 - little mistake there and you have to go
06:50 - through this iterative process of oops
06:52 - that was wrong let me fix that and then
06:54 - oh I found something else was wrong and
06:56 - let me fix that but when you get stuck
06:58 - the nice thing about doing the hour of
07:00 - code in a classroom is you know what
07:02 - raise your hand and ask somebody else
07:03 - for help this is a field where most of
07:06 - the teachers in the country and in the
07:07 - world have never themselves learned
07:09 - computer science uh you know if you're
07:11 - in school learning this right now you
07:13 - may not realize that almost none of the
07:14 - teachers learned this when they were in
07:16 - school the reason we're doing this as a
07:18 - global campaign is because we need not
07:20 - just the students to learn this so we
07:22 - need the teachers to learn as well so
07:23 - when you're stuck instead of asking the
07:25 - teacher for help just raise your hand
07:27 - and ask if any of the students can help
07:28 - you and surely somebody in the classroom
07:31 - will have figured out the things they
07:32 - need to help with and you know that way
07:34 - the whole class can get ahead
07:37 - my next question is from a 10th grader
07:40 - named Manny in Piedmont County Oklahoma
07:42 - uh saying this is my first hour of code
07:44 - but I want to keep going what can I do
07:48 - we've made this really easy and first of
07:50 - all the whole point of the hour of code
07:52 - isn't that you're going to get really
07:53 - good at coding in just one hour the
07:56 - whole point is that you realize this is
07:58 - more fun than you thought and you want
07:59 - to do more and if you want to learn more
08:01 - you know if you visit the hour of code
08:03 - websites there's a there's actually
08:05 - links for how to go beyond the hour of
08:07 - code the the code.org tutorials if you
08:09 - like the sort of Star Wars Minecraft
08:12 - Moana Flappy Bird style tutorials we've
08:15 - made there's there's 200 hours of code
08:17 - worth of of lesson plans in the courses
08:20 - we've made that that you can do that are
08:23 - like that and for teachers as well any
08:25 - teacher can start teaching whether a
08:28 - full year course or just an after school
08:30 - club or integrating into to elementary
08:32 - school using the resources on code.org
08:34 - so please do that don't stop at one one
08:37 - hour of code
08:40 - um
08:42 - right next question is from Muhammad
08:45 - Sheikh farham
08:47 - saying uh
08:49 - is basic C necessary for getting a deep
08:52 - knowledge in computer science
08:54 - and so
08:56 - computer science is frankly more than
08:58 - just coding at computer science is about
09:01 - learning algorithms coding data analysis
09:05 - uh cyber security networking these are
09:08 - all different parts of the same field
09:10 - you can learn how the internet works
09:12 - without ever writing a line of code you
09:14 - can learn how encryption Works without
09:16 - ever running a line of code but if you
09:19 - want to get good at the coding part to
09:20 - really create things yourself
09:22 - pretty much any language you start with
09:24 - is is the right place to start I always
09:26 - get asked do I need to learn JavaScript
09:28 - do I need to Learn Python what what
09:30 - language should I start with and really
09:32 - whatever language you start with
09:34 - switching to a new language is
09:35 - relatively easy all the computer
09:36 - programming languages are pretty similar
09:38 - it's not like switching from French to
09:40 - Spanish you know learning French is like
09:43 - 10 000 words you need to learn and then
09:45 - when you want to switch to Spanish the
09:46 - grammar is all different whereas
09:48 - encoding the grammar is almost always
09:50 - the same and there's about 200 words you
09:52 - need to memorize and so whatever
09:53 - language you start with you can switch
09:55 - to another language in maybe a matter of
09:58 - three weeks it's not too difficult
10:02 - um Scott summer says one of my sixth
10:04 - grade students asks how hard was it to
10:06 - create the hour of code and this is from
10:08 - Ohio uh that's a great question I mean I
10:12 - would say I'm so overwhelmed by the the
10:15 - fact that this thing that we created
10:16 - just three years ago is being used
10:18 - globally and done globally at such a
10:20 - scale
10:21 - so uh relative to how awesome it is I
10:24 - would say it's been pretty easy
10:26 - um because you could never imagine that
10:28 - you could in just three years create
10:29 - something that is being used
10:31 - from Mozambique to Zimbabwe to Armenia
10:35 - just today the the Prime Minister of
10:36 - Armenia did the hour of code in Syrian
10:39 - refugee camps they're doing at the hour
10:40 - of code the southernmost tip of Chile
10:43 - all the way to Siberia students all
10:46 - around the globe during the hour of code
10:47 - and that was unbelievable but in terms
10:50 - of what it takes to create it myself and
10:53 - my team have been working really hard on
10:56 - this uh certainly the very first time we
10:57 - did this was the hardest I've ever
10:58 - worked in my life but what's made the
11:00 - hour of code easy is that it's an idea
11:02 - that everybody wants to support and
11:05 - what's made it the most easy is the
11:06 - teachers basically decided this is great
11:08 - we're gonna do it and teachers worldwide
11:12 - have basically embraced this idea so
11:13 - really it's because of the teachers the
11:15 - Educators uh you know the teacher who
11:17 - just sent in this question uh Scott it's
11:20 - people like you that have made the hour
11:21 - of code really easy
11:25 - um from Nicole writes Larson uh who's
11:28 - from Utah she has a high school student
11:30 - who asks what are some great strategies
11:32 - I can use to Market myself and the
11:34 - skills I've learned from taking the the
11:36 - Cs principles code.org course at and so
11:39 - first of all this is a student who's
11:41 - taking the Cs principles AP class that
11:43 - code.org is making for high school
11:45 - students we now have about 19 000
11:48 - students taking apcs principles in our
11:51 - course uh and I would say first of all
11:53 - for any of you that are not taking a
11:54 - full year course after you try the hour
11:56 - of code consider taking a full year
11:58 - course because the real goal is to go
11:59 - beyond one hour and to really study
12:01 - computer science beyond that but if
12:04 - you've gotten good enough that you can
12:06 - say you know what I got this I can
12:07 - actually make things the best way to
12:09 - Market yourself to Market your skills to
12:12 - get people to notice is to make more
12:13 - things whether it's to make websites
12:15 - whether to make simple apps things like
12:17 - that and if you've used our app lab tool
12:20 - right now you make little apps we're
12:22 - going to soon make you be able to use
12:24 - those apps and actually submit them to
12:25 - the Apple App Store or the Android App
12:27 - Store so you can even sell those apps
12:29 - and then once you can point to those
12:30 - it's a great way of talking about the
12:33 - way the way you work and how how it
12:34 - works well
12:37 - um
12:38 - a question from uh
12:42 - oops let me find the next question
12:45 - next question is Shane asselstein uh has
12:48 - a fifth grader from Hawaii
12:50 - Shahira K asking what was your
12:52 - inspiration uh
12:55 - so for me uh
12:57 - there's I have two Inspirations for why
12:59 - I've done code.org uh the first
13:01 - inspiration was just my life story I
13:03 - started computer programming when I was
13:05 - 10 years old and I was living at the
13:06 - time in Tehran Iran which was not a
13:09 - great place to grow up uh you know
13:11 - Tehran itself was great but a war broke
13:13 - out in a revolution and we were getting
13:15 - bombed literally our neighborhood was
13:17 - getting bombed every single night and so
13:19 - I didn't really know how my life would
13:21 - end up and then one day my dad brought
13:23 - me home a computer and he said this has
13:25 - no games on it it has no apps on it but
13:27 - here's a book and if you can teach
13:28 - yourself to code you know you can make
13:31 - your own games and make your own apps uh
13:33 - and you know I really didn't have
13:35 - another option to do in terms of
13:37 - anything fun there was nothing fun to do
13:39 - so basically coding was my fun uh and
13:42 - I'm now living the American dream I've
13:44 - moved to America and I when my friends
13:45 - were you know bussing tables at
13:48 - restaurants in ninth grade I was working
13:50 - as a coder for tech companies as a
13:52 - summer intern and I managed to do that
13:55 - to help pay my way through college and
13:56 - I'm effective living the American dream
13:58 - as an immigrant and I look around and
14:01 - today the American dream feels a little
14:03 - bit broken it just feels like people are
14:05 - struggling to make buy and and people
14:07 - are worried about whether they're going
14:08 - to keep their jobs and meanwhile the
14:10 - tech industry and the tech jobs there's
14:12 - like 500 000 open jobs in this country
14:15 - and they can't find enough great voters
14:17 - to fill those jobs so part of the
14:19 - inspiration for for creating code.org
14:21 - was to let other people have the same
14:23 - opportunity that I had
14:24 - um but the real inspiration for for the
14:27 - work we do at code.org frankly is how
14:29 - much the teachers have decided to make
14:31 - this happen now when I started I had no
14:33 - idea that we'd get even 10 000 teachers
14:35 - interested in what we're doing we're now
14:38 - at the point that almost 500 000
14:40 - teachers globally are engaged either in
14:42 - the hour of code or code.org ongoing
14:44 - tutorials and that's what drives me
14:46 - every single day it's just unbelievable
14:48 - that the support from those teachers
14:52 - um a question from Michael Harvey in
14:54 - grade three in Maine uh asking what is
14:57 - your favorite programmer app that you
14:59 - ever created or were involved in
15:02 - um well this is a little bit
15:03 - self-referential but for me by far the
15:05 - favorite thing that I've made is the
15:07 - Star Wars hour of code tutorial and the
15:10 - reason is I've I was always a Star Wars
15:12 - fan growing up uh and the idea that we
15:15 - could you know as part of code.org
15:17 - create a tutorial that lets you control
15:19 - the droids and control R2D2 and then we
15:22 - launched it as part of the the movie
15:24 - launch campaign last year the Star Wars
15:25 - movie was the biggest movie launch in
15:27 - history and for code.org to have been
15:30 - part of that was really special
15:32 - um if you ever use that tutorial I
15:34 - personally spent every sort of line of
15:37 - Music in that tutorial was very sort of
15:39 - specifically picked up for me because
15:41 - when we first made the tutorial there
15:43 - was no music in it and then I was like
15:45 - we gotta get the Star Wars music in
15:47 - there and it wasn't easy because the
15:49 - licensing for that music was different
15:50 - we needed to get somebody else to give
15:52 - us those rights and then I literally had
15:55 - two hours worth of all the Star Wars
15:57 - movies music to listen to and I had to
15:59 - go through it and pick which 10 seconds
16:01 - do we use here and which 10 seconds do
16:03 - we use there
16:04 - um and I think I definitely geeked out
16:06 - on it I think I was the biggest Star
16:08 - Wars fan when we were making that but
16:10 - making the music of that app was was my
16:12 - little favorite contribution to the
16:13 - world
16:15 - um I think we're out of questions so uh
16:18 - I'm gonna wrap it up I just wanted to
16:19 - say again thank you so much for any of
16:22 - you whether you joined late uh or you
16:24 - stuck around the whole time thank you
16:25 - for helping make the hour of code
16:26 - campaign such a great thing such a
16:29 - worldwide celebration of computer
16:31 - science whether it's your first time
16:33 - coding today or whether you've been
16:35 - doing this for for a year or whether
16:37 - you're you know in a full year computer
16:39 - science class please stick with coding
16:42 - and computer science this is going to be
16:43 - the most important field as a student as
16:45 - you look into the 21st century every
16:47 - single area you could go into whether
16:49 - you want to become a doctor a banker a
16:52 - marketer even if you want to go into
16:54 - something like baseball computers and
16:56 - Technology are changing things and
16:58 - learning coding in computer science can
17:00 - help this campaign has now reached 300
17:03 - million hours of code roughly 1 out of
17:06 - 10 students in the entire world have
17:08 - done the hour of code right now as we've
17:11 - been talking about 30 000 students
17:13 - globally adjusted the hour of so to just
17:15 - finish it in the last 10 20 minutes and
17:17 - another 30 000 students just started
