00:56 - start with a fun icebreaker
00:58 - kevin um actually first of all kevin
01:00 - want to introduce yourself just a little
01:01 - bit
01:02 - and tell us what your favorite thing to
01:04 - do at recess was when you were in
01:06 - elementary school
01:07 - okay hi i'm kevin trevor
01:10 - 32 married get a kid um and yeah but
01:14 - i've been in this
01:16 - general field of software design and and
01:18 - uh development for about a decade now
01:22 - um and we get into in a little bit
01:23 - further later but my favorite thing to
01:25 - do at recess was foursquare
01:28 - uh yeah i had a core group of friends i
01:29 - would run out with immediately and all
01:31 - to stand in line and try to you know
01:33 - like get other people off the court and
01:35 - come with those strategies and all that
01:36 - fun stuff but
01:38 - foursquare is what i did i remember four
01:40 - square we even had a variant called four
01:41 - square kickball where you would like
01:44 - have it the square and the pitcher would
01:46 - roll the ball toward you and you'd whack
01:48 - it with your foot and so the ball went a
01:50 - lot further there
01:51 - and
01:52 - that was very competitive we were very
01:53 - cutthroat about that
01:55 - yeah awesome well kevin tell us a little
01:57 - bit more about what you do um
02:00 - what is your job title and what exactly
02:01 - do you do
02:03 - so right my job title is user interface
02:05 - uh development manager well uh so
02:08 - essentially i'm in charge of making all
02:10 - the screens or all the
02:13 - components and elements that would be
02:15 - inside of software
02:16 - um just the visual side of it and how
02:18 - they how they look and how they
02:20 - how they feel all their little
02:22 - animations
02:23 - all those little intricacies um i build
02:26 - those and help other developers
02:28 - put them into their projects
02:31 - yeah okay so let's break that title down
02:33 - a little bit so a user interface what
02:36 - what does that mean
02:37 - the user interface is anything that you
02:38 - interact with on the computer
02:41 - everything you know is is stored in the
02:43 - computer but you have to interact with
02:45 - it somehow and how you interact with
02:47 - this by clicking on icons or you know
02:50 - you know touching on stuff with the
02:52 - on the screen so the user interface is
02:54 - everything that you're interacting with
02:56 - i see
02:57 - go ahead
02:58 - yeah sorry and who is the user in this
03:00 - case for you
03:02 - for me the user uh is doctors and nurses
03:05 - and people inside of um doctor
03:07 - facilities hospitals
03:09 - uh and
03:10 - and other developers inside of my
03:12 - company also or part of my user base
03:14 - specifically but okay yeah yeah and then
03:17 - the other part of your title is
03:18 - development manager so
03:21 - what what does that mean in your
03:23 - day-to-day life
03:24 - right so our company just creates
03:25 - software um for hospitals and doctors uh
03:30 - so
03:30 - development is all of that right our
03:32 - entire
03:34 - company has
03:35 - a lot of developers software engineers
03:37 - people that make these these
03:38 - applications day in and day out
03:40 - and so i um i manage a small team that
03:44 - is in charge of developing a certain
03:47 - part of all of all that software
03:49 - yeah can you give us a quick screenshot
03:52 - of or like just share your screen of
03:54 - what doctors might see when they're
03:55 - using um greenway health's product
03:59 - sure
04:01 - so this is a uh unfinished
04:03 - kind of
04:04 - uh
04:06 - screen
04:07 - our application that's currently being
04:09 - developed so this is what a doctor would
04:11 - look at whenever they're looking at
04:13 - their their
04:14 - patient list for the day
04:16 - or even uh you know just their patient
04:18 - list in general they would come down
04:19 - here
04:21 - and see the patient name be able to see
04:22 - a photo if they wanted to
04:24 - is where all of your information
04:26 - whenever you go to the doctor um your
04:28 - stuff would show up here so the doctor's
04:30 - looking at their schedule for the day
04:31 - they're trying to figure out who they
04:32 - need to look at and you know what they
04:34 - what they're doing with their day
04:35 - they would come here and kind of look
04:37 - through
04:38 - a list like this to see who their next
04:39 - appointment is and
04:41 - and there's a plenty of other little
04:42 - things going on here but for the most
04:44 - part you know this is
04:46 - the only interesting bit
04:48 - yeah so if i go to the doctor's office
04:49 - this is kind of what the doctors and the
04:51 - nurses are using to make sure that all
04:53 - my information is up to date is that
04:54 - right exactly right like this will
04:56 - either be on a tablet or on the computer
04:58 - that they're clicking at so anytime
04:59 - they're you're in a doctor's office and
05:01 - they're you know playing with a tablet
05:03 - or computer uh they're using the
05:04 - software like this
05:06 - okay to capture all the data about you
05:08 - and to you know
05:12 - do all their doctoring stuff about with
05:13 - you all the doctoring stuff yeah yeah um
05:16 - yeah that's that's seems much faster
05:18 - than using pen and paper which i
05:21 - remember when i was a kid going in and
05:23 - doctors writing things down by hand
05:26 - yeah i remember that too and then you'd
05:27 - see it sometimes and it'll just be
05:30 - you can't read it because doctor january
05:31 - is not great aimlessly bad handwriting
05:34 - and you know the system like this is
05:35 - important because it lets kind of your
05:37 - information your medical information get
05:39 - shared amongst various like hospitals
05:41 - providers and that sort of thing right
05:43 - exactly all this stuff is
05:45 - is stored in a cloud or a server of some
05:47 - sort
05:48 - okay yeah anyone can access it for the
05:50 - most part anywhere yeah so if i go to a
05:52 - different doctor they can also see the
05:53 - same information so i can get good care
05:55 - wherever i go yeah oh that's really cool
05:58 - so we do hear a lot about doctors and
05:59 - nurses in healthcare that are kind of
06:01 - the face of healthcare that we see and
06:03 - when we go into the hospital or the
06:05 - doctor's office but
06:06 - it seems like there are a lot of other
06:08 - jobs that make quality health care
06:10 - possible um
06:12 - so tell us a little bit about your work
06:14 - journey how did you end up here like
06:16 - where did you start and how did you end
06:18 - up here
06:19 - this is where i should share some of my
06:21 - yeah go ahead right so i started out uh
06:24 - going to college uh for digital arts and
06:27 - design now i'll screen share again here
06:29 - so we can see
06:31 - um so i was a graphic designer way back
06:33 - in the day and this is some of the stuff
06:34 - that i made whenever can you see my
06:36 - screen yes i can see it right so like
06:38 - after i was done with college for the
06:40 - most part this is where i'll go out to
06:41 - businesses and be like hey hire me as a
06:43 - graphic designer
06:45 - and uh i mean
06:46 - like this is just kind of a magazine
06:48 - advertisement um
06:50 - a logo redesigned for the city of osaka
06:53 - oh cool
06:54 - yeah
06:56 - and uh this is just kind of an online
06:59 - advertisement of some sort oh that looks
07:00 - really cool did you is this by did you
07:03 - draw this out by hand
07:05 - i did everything on the computer i was
07:06 - very much so i wasn't very good at
07:09 - drawing myself okay you know pen and
07:11 - paper so everything was very digital for
07:13 - me oh that's super cool at least in my
07:16 - process it was very digital and it's
07:18 - kind of like uh a band advertisement
07:21 - okay and this is uh like a bus stop yeah
07:24 - it's just kind of way to show what it
07:25 - would look like out there in the water
07:27 - yeah
07:28 - it didn't actually get printed it's not
07:30 - actually out of bus stop anywhere
07:32 - so i can't go out and find it endless
07:33 - ambition the band
07:34 - i don't even know that's a real band
07:37 - who might be
07:39 - uh then some more magazine kind of
07:41 - spreads very into to print to print
07:44 - design
07:45 - yeah
07:46 - so yeah i've made
07:48 - a lot of different just kind of
07:50 - magazines in my time there
07:52 - um
07:53 - really skateboards and snowboarding so
07:55 - that was obviously a big thing you know
07:57 - for two of my magazines just kind of
07:59 - like arch and then skateboarding and
08:01 - snowboarding and that was
08:03 - all i was into in college
08:05 - yeah this is a skate deck that i
08:07 - i did draw right so i wasn't very good
08:09 - at hand drawing but i could do doodles
08:11 - pretty well neat so this is a
08:14 - yeah this is for a skateboard deck yep
08:16 - yep so it's kind of combining your uh
08:18 - the art and the boarding together into
08:20 - one right
08:22 - unfortunately this also did not get
08:23 - printed onto a real skateboard
08:25 - hey there's still possible right yeah
08:27 - it's still possible i could i could dig
08:28 - this up and do it this is really cool so
08:31 - how did you go from um coming up with
08:34 - like art and graphic design
08:36 - into what you do now
08:38 - it's really kind of a slow process uh my
08:41 - first job out of college
08:43 - was with a user experience team where i
08:46 - was a graphic designer and i don't know
08:48 - if you remember um the blockbuster like
08:51 - video rentals or you use redbox right
08:54 - yeah blockbuster i remember that i do
08:56 - the same thing and so i worked for the
08:58 - company that uh that owned all of those
09:00 - and so i would actually put all the
09:02 - graphics and created all the graphics
09:03 - for
09:04 - the blockbuster express kiosks that was
09:06 - my first job out of college wow that's
09:08 - such a throwback
09:10 - i know right
09:11 - yeah
09:12 - nobody rents videos anymore it's all
09:14 - it's online online now or what what is
09:17 - video random i haven't rented a video in
09:18 - quite some time right you just go to
09:20 - amazon or netflix or hulu and watch
09:22 - whatever yeah
09:23 - yeah um so yeah that was my first job
09:26 - and then um i got another job from that
09:28 - as a lead designer of a softball company
09:30 - a small softball company softball cool
09:33 - yeah they made me sleep uh like bats and
09:36 - face masks and helmet and helmets and
09:38 - everything so i was just kind of in
09:39 - charge of creating their general look
09:41 - and feel and their website and creating
09:43 - their website was part of how i started
09:45 - evolving into this whole thing
09:47 - into being a developer i was really
09:49 - hands-on with the people that were
09:51 - developing the new website as i was as i
09:54 - was designing it
09:55 - and i learned quite a bit and i was kind
09:58 - of interested in it and so the job i
10:00 - took after that was with the with aaa
10:02 - you know the people you call whenever
10:04 - you're on the on the side of the road oh
10:05 - yeah
10:07 - and that was as a webmaster so it was
10:09 - much more a development-focused job
10:12 - and so i just started sliding fully down
10:15 - in that and i haven't really designed
10:17 - anything for quite some time yeah so it
10:20 - sounds like you didn't necessarily code
10:22 - a lot as a kid but you kind of found
10:24 - your way to coding through
10:26 - design and through working with
10:29 - companies that needed
10:30 - work done on on their design right yeah
10:33 - when i was a kid coding wasn't a very
10:35 - big thing uh you know i was early 90s
10:37 - when i was growing up i was born in the
10:39 - 80s so
10:40 - coding wasn't exactly accessible or you
10:42 - know i didn't even have a computer or
10:44 - access to the internet until i was a
10:45 - little bit older
10:47 - um so coding wasn't really anything on
10:48 - the mind um until yeah it just kind of
10:51 - worked out right you never know where
10:52 - you're gonna end up you have to try new
10:54 - things
10:55 - yeah absolutely that's just kind of how
10:57 - it works you know yeah i know that's
10:58 - super cool to hear um because i also
11:00 - didn't start coding until a little later
11:03 - and so there's always tons of different
11:05 - paths to see how computer science may
11:08 - end up in our lives
11:09 - um just as a reminder to our
11:11 - participants here uh be sure to share
11:13 - your questions in the q a um for kevin
11:17 - um yeah so kevin what do you feel is
11:19 - awesome about your job
11:21 - what's really great about my job is is
11:24 - working with the healthcare industry and
11:25 - you know allowing people to get access
11:28 - to healthcare a little bit easier and to
11:30 - allow doctors to do their to do um what
11:32 - they need to do to help the community
11:34 - and to help
11:35 - uh just everyone that goes to the doctor
11:36 - you know they they have enough on their
11:38 - plate the doctors do so i i we want to
11:41 - make all the paperwork that they do as
11:43 - as smooth and seamless as possible
11:46 - um and the other great parts about my
11:48 - job is this is my office
11:50 - i just
11:51 - i i
11:53 - stumble out of bed and come over here in
11:55 - the mornings and uh this is where i
11:57 - remain for the day is just kind of
11:59 - in my office here so i get to spend a
12:00 - lot of time with my my my wife and my
12:02 - daughter
12:03 - and um
12:05 - i really can't ask for too much more

12:23 - nice
12:24 - closets more stuff on the walls oh lots
12:27 - of art yeah lots of stuff on the walls
12:28 - and the floor is covered with laundry
12:30 - because i'm not
12:32 - doing laundry
12:33 - you know i think that's the reality for
12:36 - a lot of us laundry on the floor
12:38 - yeah you have organized piles
12:41 - yeah you know when you don't have a
12:43 - parent there to like tell you to pick up
12:45 - your laundry it just stays on the floor
12:46 - it's convenient you know
12:48 - it's convenient until you're digging
12:50 - through a pile and then you're like oh
12:51 - this is why you fold clothes this is why
12:53 - you fold them and put them away so you
12:54 - know where they're at whenever you need
12:56 - them
12:57 - yeah yeah i'm also seeing i think i see
12:59 - some like board games there on the on
13:01 - the back shelf is that right yeah i've
13:02 - got a collection of
13:04 - of kid board games and then board games
13:06 - for
13:07 - for adult friends and stuff like uh
13:09 - scrabble and clue and
13:12 - oh clue classic nice and the kid board
13:15 - games are for playing with your daughter
13:16 - is that right yeah she's not old enough
13:18 - yet we just have those until she's she's
13:20 - only eight months old right now so she's
13:21 - oh she wouldn't know what to do with any
13:23 - yeah
13:24 - yeah different type of game that she's
13:26 - into right now yeah
13:28 - what do you do
13:29 - what do you like to do outside of work
13:31 - i thought of working like just kind of
13:33 - go on going walks and hikes and stuff
13:35 - right i live in florida so there's a lot
13:37 - there's a decent amount of just hiking
13:39 - trails around here and seeing the uh the
13:41 - swampy wildlife the alligators and stuff
13:43 - yeah watch out for those right yeah you
13:45 - gotta watch out uh just if you see one
13:47 - you just kind of just backtrack go the
13:49 - other way don't
13:50 - don't get near those
13:52 - um but yeah just try to spend as much
13:53 - time outside as i can since i spend all
13:55 - my time in in this office yeah and
13:58 - i think you mentioned you also like to
14:00 - play games right uh video games
14:02 - yeah i do yeah right next to my work set
14:04 - up here i've got two monitors then over
14:06 - here i've got my my
14:08 - home pc that i built uh myself oh wow um
14:12 - yeah i i would show off you know all the
14:15 - cool leds inside of it and all the fans
14:17 - and stuff but i can't get my oh yeah my
14:19 - camera down there
14:20 - is it ever a distraction to have your
14:22 - gaming set up right next to your work
14:23 - setup
14:25 - it can be um
14:27 - it can be that's why it stays off for
14:29 - most of the day until you know
14:30 - designated times
14:32 - yeah yeah it can be you know especially
14:34 - when we first started
14:35 - um whenever you first started working
14:37 - from home and
14:38 - like oh man i could just play video
14:40 - games all day but no i'm like you can't
14:41 - you gotta
14:43 - yeah do your work you gotta actually
14:45 - help doctors and nurses get there
14:47 - yeah
14:48 - so along the way along your cs journey
14:51 - like were there people who helped you
14:53 - like who who was that and how
14:56 - i mean plenty of people that have helped
14:58 - me throughout the years uh a couple of
14:59 - mentors specifically at uh at triple-a
15:03 - and the job i had afterwards um
15:06 - there's people that just like knew a lot
15:08 - and i just asked them a lot of questions
15:10 - really that's all getting a mentor is is
15:12 - just finding someone that'll answer all
15:14 - the questions that you have
15:16 - and so i just found those people
15:18 - and i bugged them relentlessly with
15:20 - questions until i i knew you know a
15:23 - portion of what they knew about just
15:24 - trying to get as much information from
15:26 - them as possible and they were you know
15:28 - um the reason why they're good people or
15:31 - good mentors like that's because they
15:32 - entertained it um so really yeah it's
15:34 - just really anyone that you can ask a
15:36 - lot of questions about
15:37 - i'll ask a lot of questions too is uh
15:40 - someone that can help you along the way
15:41 - and that's that's who i found just
15:43 - people that answer questions
15:44 - yeah yeah
15:46 - and kind of in the same vein what advice
15:48 - would you give to students out there
15:50 - listening who might be just starting to
15:52 - learn about computer science
15:54 - um it's difficult but it's you can do it
15:57 - you know like it's for sure anyone can
15:59 - can learn it there's a million different
16:01 - ways you can contribute to computer
16:03 - science and to software development or
16:05 - any of the number of things that can be
16:07 - done on a computer there's
16:09 - any personality any way like you learn
16:12 - you can you can learn different ways and
16:14 - methods and you can you can just do it
16:16 - uh so you just gotta try right where
16:18 - persistence is really the only thing you
16:19 - need in this world so you know if you
16:22 - run into a roadblock you gotta either
16:23 - work through it or go around it and try
16:25 - a different avenue
16:26 - um but really just
16:28 - just give it a shot you know if you're
16:29 - interested at all then just just you
16:31 - just gotta do it
16:32 - yeah you mentioned asking lots of
16:34 - questions do you recommend that for
16:37 - students learning computer science as
16:38 - well i mean recommended for everyone but
16:40 - yeah with computer science right like
16:42 - even
16:43 - um the job i had before this the my boss
16:46 - was he's been doing this for like 20
16:47 - years his dad was also an engineer and
16:50 - he knew everything but he was constantly
16:52 - reading things constantly learning
16:54 - so that's why he knew everything because
16:56 - he was always trying to seek new
16:58 - information try to trying to
17:00 - you know learn something new or if he
17:02 - saw something he didn't understand he'd
17:03 - immediately dive into the documentation
17:05 - and try to find some some answer as to
17:08 - why he didn't understand it and to
17:09 - figure it out
17:10 - um so yeah it's just
17:13 - yeah
17:14 - yeah ask lots of questions and seek you
17:16 - know answers to your questions really
17:18 - either by asking people or reading about
17:20 - it or you know just learning in general
17:22 - yeah yeah and you know what would you
17:24 - say to
17:25 - you know a student who may not
17:27 - necessarily see themselves doing
17:29 - computer science maybe they're like into
17:30 - design and graphics like you were when
17:32 - you were younger and maybe they just
17:34 - don't know how they could use computer
17:37 - science in their life what would you say
17:38 - to them
17:39 - i mean i mean computer science yeah it's
17:41 - very all-encompassing right
17:43 - my degree is in digital arts and design
17:46 - um so even people that develop software
17:49 - all day need to have someone that makes
17:52 - stuff look good
17:53 - so you know there's there's huge teams
17:55 - these companies i've worked at things
17:57 - like 80 90 people who don't do don't
17:59 - code they they do design and they they
18:02 - make things look good and they they do
18:04 - all sorts of stuff technical writing uh
18:07 - people that write things you know all
18:08 - day also are needed in software teams so
18:10 - it's
18:11 - anything really
18:13 - software's so all-encompassing these
18:14 - days
18:15 - yeah it's wrong you can really do any
18:17 - job inside of it seems like a huge team
18:20 - effort
18:21 - yes
18:22 - yeah
