00:05 - You can also assign or update a particular
index's value.
00:08 - You refer to the slot the same way.
00:11 - Names at index zero gets the value "Sarah"
would replace the current value at index zero,
00:16 - just like assigning a new value to a variable.
00:20 - Once you have created a list, you can modify
it by adding items,
00:23 - removing items or inserting items.
00:26 - To add an item to a list, you can use the
appendItem() function.
00:30 - Let's add "Kelly" to the end of the list of
names like this: append item, names, "Kelly."
00:36 - Notice that appendItem() is a function that
accepts two parameters:
00:40 - the list name and the actual value that you want to add.
00:43 - Appending an item always adds the value to
the end of the list.
00:47 - To remove an item, you use -- wait for it
-- the removeItem() function.
00:52 - If we want to remove "Josh" from the list
of names, we'd need to know the index where
00:56 - Josh is stored so we could do this: remove item, names, one.
01:02 - When you remove items, the whole list shrinks
01:04 - and it closes the gap of the item that was removed.
01:07 - Now, our list has four items, indexed zero
through three.
01:11 - Because the list shrank, items that come after
the removal point are effectively re-indexed,
01:17 - so if we once knew that Kelly was stored at
index four, Kelly is now at index three.
01:21 - This is not a problem, but something to be
mindful of.
01:25 - We can also insert items into the middle of
the list with insertItem(), like this:
01:30 - insert item, names, two, "Brook."
01:33 - The insertItem() function needs three parameters:
the name of the list, the index you want the
01:38 - new item to appear at and the value to insert.
01:41 - Inserting an item grows the size of the list. Similar to removeItem(),
01:45 - the items in the list that come after the insertion point will be re-indexed.
01:50 - Because indexes are just numbers, you can
put anything in between the square brackets
01:54 - that evaluates to a number, like variables
or even arithmetic expressions.
01:58 - For example, let's say we're keeping track
of temperature readings
02:02 - in a location with a variable called "loc."
02:04 - Var loc gets three.
02:07 - We can change the value in numList at index
loc like this: numList at loc gets one.
