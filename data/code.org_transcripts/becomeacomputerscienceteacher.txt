00:09 - There's so many computer science jobs out there that are not being filled.
00:12 - So the more computer science teachers we have in our school systems
00:15 - the more students we will be able to reach.
00:18 - And getting past that initial fear of what
computer sciences is,
00:21 - is what's gonna change the whole field of
computer science.
00:34 - The curriculum is very accessible to
first-time teachers.
00:37 - I think it's also accessible to
experienced teachers.
00:41 - If you didn't have any background knowledge
of computers, technology, computer science
00:45 - whatever the case may be,
you can successfully teach this course.
00:50 - So it's great.
00:53 - Having lots of teachers in the classroom
will give us the ability
00:56 - to adapt to a future that
frankly none of us can predict.
01:01 - The workplace has changed.
01:03 - Education has to change.
01:05 - And this is all part of helping to prepare
students
01:09 - for the world that they're going to work in.
01:12 - If you have an interest you need to go for
it!
01:16 - And you need to do that really not just
for yourself
01:19 - but certainly to benefit your students.
01:22 - They need stuff that is relevant and this...
01:26 - I think this is it.
01:29 - Yeah.
