00:10 - imagine i'm a teacher who needs to enter
00:12 - grades from an exam my students took
00:16 - i'm not sure how many i need to enter so
00:18 - i'll create one arraylist to store the
00:20 - students names
00:22 - and another to store their grades
00:26 - i'm entering the grades in alphabetical
00:27 - order by the students names for aisha
00:30 - freili celeste etc
00:35 - the arraylist class has methods for
00:36 - adding and changing values in a list
00:40 - there are two ways to add to an
00:42 - arraylist
00:44 - the first way adds an item to the end of
00:46 - the list
00:48 - we'll add aisha's grade by saying the
00:50 - name of the arraylist
00:52 - dot add
00:54 - we pass the value we want to add as its
00:56 - argument
00:58 - now let's add celeste grade
01:02 - we forgot to add braley's grade
01:04 - we can use the other version of the add
01:06 - method to add an item at a specific
01:08 - location
01:10 - we want to add briley's grade at index 1
01:13 - before celeste grade
01:16 - to do this we say the name of the
01:18 - arraylist dot add
01:21 - we pass the index where we want to add
01:23 - the item
01:25 - and the value to add at that location as
01:27 - its arguments
01:30 - to make sure we entered the grades
01:31 - correctly
01:32 - we can loop through the list just like a
01:34 - 1d array
01:37 - when we loop a 1d array we use the
01:39 - length of the array in the condition of
01:41 - our for loop
01:43 - with an arraylist we need to use the
01:45 - size method
01:47 - to get the number of items in the
01:49 - arraylist
01:51 - in the body of the for loop
01:53 - we use the get method to get a value
01:56 - from a list
01:57 - just like a 1d array we want to specify
02:00 - the index we want to retrieve from the
02:02 - list
02:05 - inside the print statement we can say
02:08 - names.get
02:11 - and use the loop control variable index
02:14 - as the argument to get the students
02:16 - names
02:18 - we can do the same to print the grades
02:22 - oops we forgot to give braley the extra
02:24 - credit points they earned for coming
02:26 - after school for tutoring
02:29 - to change a value in a list
02:31 - we use the set method so we can say
02:34 - grades.set
02:36 - that specify the index we want to change
02:39 - and the new value
02:42 - with these methods we can easily add
02:45 - change
02:46 - and retrieve items from an array list
