00:02 - [Music]
00:07 - hi welcome to session five of the AI 101
00:10 - for teachers professional learning
00:12 - series now that we've made it to the end
00:14 - of the series you may be wondering so
00:17 - now what how can I bring what I have
00:20 - learned into my
00:21 - classroom in this session we will
00:24 - explore resources that you can use in
00:26 - your classroom tomorrow we will also
00:28 - discuss topics for ating new AI tools
00:31 - resources and curricula let's get
00:35 - [Music]
00:39 - started as we start thinking about
00:41 - bringing AI to the classroom it is
00:43 - essential to distinguish between
00:45 - teaching with AI and teaching about AI
00:48 - when we teach with AI we are using AI as
00:51 - a tool to enhance teaching and learning
00:54 - when we teach with AI we are often also
00:56 - teaching students how to use AI as a
00:58 - tool when we teach about AI we teach
01:01 - students what AI is and how it works as
01:05 - with any technology we want students to
01:07 - move Beyond simply consuming the
01:09 - technology we want students to have the
01:11 - knowledge they need to be creators and
01:13 - critical evaluators of the technology
01:16 - you might be thinking if I want to teach
01:18 - about AI how do I know what I should be
01:20 - teaching what do my students really need
01:23 - to know we are in the early stages of AI
01:27 - in education although Comprehensive High
01:29 - high quality curricula may not be
01:31 - plentiful at the moment it is available
01:34 - and new curriculum will become more
01:37 - widely available over time these are
01:39 - some things to consider When selecting
01:41 - the curricula you will use with your
01:43 - students does the curricula provide
01:46 - teacher supports like lesson plans and
01:48 - Student Activities is there a focus on
01:51 - what AI is and how it works will
01:54 - students have the opportunity to think
01:56 - critically about the societal impacts of
01:58 - AI in a field often surrounded by hype
02:02 - and misinformation the curriculum should
02:04 - strive to dispel common misconceptions
02:06 - about AI clarifying its limitations and
02:09 - demystifying the fears around it always
02:12 - remember that teaching AI is not solely
02:14 - about the technology itself but also
02:16 - about cultivating critical thinking and
02:18 - informed judgment in students regarding
02:21 - its applications and
02:23 - implications let's take a look at an
02:25 - example of curriculum designed to teach
02:27 - students about AI hi my name is Anita
02:30 - dbar laen I taught artificial
02:33 - intelligence and machine learning to
02:36 - high school students for the last two
02:38 - years from the how AI Works page you'll
02:41 - notice a series of videos that c.org has
02:43 - put together to clearly explain
02:45 - different components of artificial
02:47 - intelligence though these could be
02:49 - Standalone videos each is supported with
02:51 - a comprehensive lesson plan with various
02:54 - components designed to make a learning
02:56 - process streamlined and efficient these
02:58 - elements are organized to provide both
03:01 - Educators and students with a cohesive
03:03 - and engaging learning
03:06 - experience let's take a look at the
03:08 - first lesson as you slowly scroll
03:10 - through the lesson plan take note that
03:13 - each lesson comes fully equipped with a
03:15 - complete set of resources to Aid in
03:17 - teaching including slides and activity
03:20 - guides clearly stated objectives warm up
03:23 - activities and guided notes accompany
03:26 - each lesson in addition to high quality
03:28 - videos you also find helpful teaching
03:31 - tips to enhance your delivery and a list
03:34 - of additional resources for further
03:36 - exploration all of these elements are
03:39 - meticulously designed to provide a rich
03:41 - well-rounded educational
03:44 - experience take time to become familiar
03:46 - with the material as you navigate
03:48 - through the lesson as we dive deeper
03:50 - into the course material it's important
03:53 - to highlight that some lessons come with
03:55 - interactive and engaging widgets these
03:57 - aren't just eye-catching elements
03:59 - they're designed with a pedagogical
04:01 - Focus to help simplify complex AI
04:04 - Concepts and make them more accessible
04:06 - to students to give you hands-on
04:09 - experience let's jump into our first
04:11 - activity recognizing fish this exercise
04:15 - is designed to introduce students to the
04:17 - fundamentals of machine learning which
04:19 - is a subset of AI here we'll be training
04:22 - about distinguish between images of fish
04:25 - and those that are not fish allow me to
04:28 - demonstrate
04:30 - as you can see I'm providing input data
04:33 - to the bot by categorizing their images
04:36 - so how does the AI bot use this data
04:40 - essentially it takes the information we
04:42 - provided whether an image represent a
04:44 - fish or not and looks for patterns that
04:46 - it can use to identify a fish over time
04:50 - and with enough data the bot becomes
04:53 - increasingly accurate at identifying
04:55 - fish thereby giving us a simplified but
04:58 - impactful glimpse into how machine
05:00 - learning algorithms work based on the
05:03 - training provided the next step is to
05:05 - test the AI to see how well it is learn
05:07 - to identify fish this will involve
05:10 - presenting the bot with new unseen
05:12 - images and evaluating its ability to
05:15 - correctly categorize them as fish or not
05:18 - fish your students will be able to
05:21 - analyze the results of the training and
05:23 - how the opportunity to continue training
05:25 - the bot to increase the
05:28 - accuracy the second part of the lesson
05:30 - is a more open-ended as students explore
05:33 - their own ideas and feelings about the
05:35 - implications of labeling data let's
05:38 - check out another interactive lesson on
05:40 - how neuron networks work just as our
05:42 - brains have neurons connected by
05:44 - synapsis neuron networks have layers of
05:47 - mathematical neurons that process
05:49 - information and adapt based on patterns
05:52 - they find allowing them to make
05:53 - decisions or
05:55 - predictions in this lesson students
05:58 - watch a video introduce producing neuron
06:00 - networks and then experience a gget
06:02 - simulating a video recommender system
06:05 - that makes recommendations based on
06:07 - certain
06:08 - input once they understand how the
06:10 - widget Works they have the opportunity
06:13 - to customize a widget in this
06:15 - recommendation similar to how a newer
06:17 - Network can customize its
06:18 - recommendations on popular media sites
06:21 - they also examine how the
06:23 - recommendations they see are limited by
06:25 - the data that the network uses leading
06:28 - to a discussion on how they can gather
06:30 - more data to make sure diverse opinions
06:33 - are
06:34 - represented let's check out another
06:36 - engaging lesson that uses the unplugged
06:38 - activity in the computer vision lesson
06:41 - students start by observing and
06:43 - evaluating optical illusions after
06:45 - watching a video that explains how
06:47 - computer Vision Works and how computer
06:50 - process visual information they design
06:52 - and test algorithm that uses a network
06:55 - to decide what number is shown on a
06:57 - seven segment display
07:00 - we recognize that not every educational
07:02 - setting allows for extended periods of
07:04 - instructions for those who are pressed
07:07 - for time we offer a optimized
07:09 - alternative how AI Works in a day this
07:13 - is a condensed version of the course
07:15 - specifically tat for educators who have
07:18 - who only have a single day or precisely
07:20 - 65 minutes to dedicate to teaching AI
07:24 - this compact lesson ensures that the
07:26 - essential topics are covered efficiently
07:29 - without sacrificing educational
07:35 - impact throughout this professional
07:37 - learning series we have learned a lot
07:39 - about teaching with AI artificial
07:42 - intelligence has opened up extraordinary
07:44 - possibilities for revolutionizing
07:47 - Education changing how we approach
07:49 - teaching and learning it promises to
07:51 - deliver personalized adaptive learning
07:54 - experiences for students while providing
07:56 - Educators with tools to optimize their
07:58 - teaching strategies and reduce their
08:01 - workload like any tool generative AI
08:04 - tools have strengths and weaknesses one
08:07 - significant consideration for teachers
08:09 - is whether the generative AI tools meet
08:11 - the needs of their
08:13 - classrooms when considering which AI
08:16 - tool you will use you may want to
08:17 - consider the following was the tool
08:20 - designed to be used in an educational
08:23 - setting does the teacher have visibility
08:25 - into how students are interacting with
08:28 - the AI tool what guard rails are in
08:31 - place to ensure student safety let's
08:34 - take a look at a tool that is designed
08:36 - specifically for use in K12 education

13:21 - that's one of K Migo's Specialties once
13:23 - I select the co-create a rubric feature
13:27 - cono requests the objective for for the
13:29 - lesson and wants to know what I'm
13:30 - planning to grade if I know the standard
13:33 - I can include that as well my students
13:36 - are going to be writing a research paper
13:38 - for the science lesson that we just
13:40 - finished kigo will then ask me a series
13:43 - of questions throughout this process so
13:45 - that we're truly collaborating to
13:47 - co-create the perfect rubric that I
13:50 - want once I've answered all of K Migo's

16:11 - the tool promote active dialogue between
16:13 - you and your
16:16 - students let's take a look at an example
16:19 - of an AI assisted assessment tool for
16:21 - writing hi I'm Mandy Figaroa the product
16:24 - owner for the Criterion interactive
16:26 - prototype and I'll be giving you a
16:27 - walkthrough of our application
16:30 - this product provides examples of how AI
16:32 - can help but not replace teachers in the
16:34 - classroom by providing Time Savings and
16:36 - structure but it still relies on the
16:38 - teacher for Hands-On guidance and
16:40 - coaching for their students the
16:42 - Prototype is built around this user flow
16:44 - but we'll be focusing on the places
16:46 - where AI offers teachers and students
16:48 - the most benefit scoring and providing
16:50 - feedback on student
16:51 - writing to begin with the teacher
16:53 - creates the assignment and then the
16:55 - student will work on planning their
16:56 - essay and writing their first draft the
16:58 - main focus for the first draft is
17:00 - planning and executing on that plan the
17:02 - focus of the second draft is revising
17:04 - the essay to ensure it closely aligns
17:05 - with the standards of a specific genre
17:07 - in this case persuasive writing teachers
17:09 - will be able to review the AI generated
17:11 - provisional scores and feedback before
17:13 - the students begin revising their essays
17:15 - the focus of the third draft is editing
17:17 - the essay to improve spelling and
17:19 - grammatical correctness teachers will
17:21 - again be able to review the AI generated
17:23 - provisional scores and feedback before
17:25 - students begin on this phase teachers
17:27 - who tested the protot type liked the
17:29 - structure of the app to help them manage
17:30 - writing assignments in their classroom
17:33 - we'll start our demo with the setup and
17:34 - planning phase which will guide teachers
17:36 - and students through getting started and
17:38 - creating their first draft the first
17:40 - step is for teachers to create the
17:42 - assignment for their students in the
17:43 - teacher application we guide teachers
17:46 - step by step through the creation
17:47 - process they can choose the genre the
17:49 - student will be writing
17:52 - in the learning
17:54 - objectives the assignment will focus
17:57 - on
18:01 - and then they can choose which writing
18:02 - prompts will be available for the
18:04 - student to respond
18:07 - to we're switching to the student
18:09 - application now research shows students
18:12 - often struggle with how to plan their
18:14 - writing but the more time students spend
18:16 - planning their essay the more effective
18:18 - they are at writing and the higher
18:19 - quality their writing is so we scaffold
18:21 - them through the planning process
18:23 - students brainstorm main
18:25 - ideas prioritize their main ideas
18:41 - and generate supporting details related
18:43 - to each main idea using a validated
18:45 - instructional strategy after the student
18:48 - has completed the planning phase they
18:50 - can use that plan to write a first draft
18:53 - for example here the student is writing
18:55 - their first main idea paragraph and has
18:57 - access to to the main idea and
18:59 - supporting
19:01 - details that they generated during
19:04 - brainstorming after writing each
19:06 - paragraph students can request AI
19:08 - generated feedback from the system we
19:10 - use AI models to do analysis of their
19:12 - paragraph to identify how closely their
19:14 - paragraph aligns with the supporting
19:15 - details that they included in their plan
19:17 - and to identify if the paragraph is too
19:19 - long or too short and if the student is
19:21 - making good transitions between their
19:23 - supporting details as students are
19:25 - working on their first draft teachers
19:26 - may want to review the system generated
19:28 - feedback with them to help their student
19:31 - incorporate more of their main ideas and
19:32 - supporting details into their
19:35 - essay after the student has finished
19:37 - writing and adjusting all of their
19:39 - paragraphs then they can submit their
19:41 - first draft at this point the teacher
19:43 - will be able to review the essay and the
19:45 - AI generated scoring which brings us to
19:47 - the revision
19:48 - phase the next step is for teachers to
19:51 - use the teacher application to read the
19:53 - students essay that they've submitted
19:55 - and then review the AI generated scores
19:57 - that we we have given them based on the
20:00 - rubric the scoring is built around
20:02 - teachers have the opportunity to view
20:04 - the rubric at many points during this
20:06 - process and a planned future feature
20:08 - would allow teachers to customize the
20:10 - rubric to allow align with their state
20:12 - standards and classroom scoring
20:17 - policies once the teacher reviews all of
20:19 - the scores and overrides any that they
20:22 - disagree
20:27 - with
20:30 - then they are able to move on to the
20:32 - next step which is reviewing the
20:33 - revision
20:35 - tasks that we have generated for the
20:41 - student these are based on their rubric
20:43 - scores and give the student system
20:44 - generated feedback in the form of a
20:47 - praise a question and a suggestion to
20:50 - help them improve their rubric
20:55 - score the teacher has the opportunity to
20:57 - prioritize this
20:59 - feedback and they can
21:03 - edit or hide any feedback that they
21:06 - disagree
21:11 - with as well as creating additional
21:13 - feedback
21:15 - messages after teachers see how their
21:17 - students are scoring on the persuasive
21:18 - writing rubric they may decide to teach
21:20 - a lesson about how to identify and
21:21 - address an alternate position in an
21:23 - essay for example but they won't need to
21:25 - individually add that feedback message
21:27 - to each student essay who needs it the
21:29 - program has already done that for them
21:31 - once the teacher has finished reviewing
21:32 - the student's first draft they can send
21:34 - it back to the student to make changes
21:36 - based on the feedback they received
21:37 - after the student makes those changes
21:39 - they'll send the essay back to their
21:40 - teacher and the teacher will go through
21:42 - that same process except that instead of
21:44 - looking at the revision tasks to align
21:46 - with the genre the student is writing in
21:48 - they will be looking at editing tasks
21:49 - which are related to the punctuation
21:51 - capitalization usage and spelling of the
21:54 - essay once the teacher is able to see
21:56 - which grammar errors are most common
21:58 - they may decide to pull aside a small
21:59 - group or individual students for further
22:02 - instruction on specific types of
22:04 - errors after the teacher has reviewed
22:06 - the second draft of the essay the
22:08 - student will have the opportunity to
22:09 - work on it again to create their third
22:11 - draft in the student application at this
22:13 - point they can read their essay and
22:15 - choose which of the categories they'd
22:17 - like to work on capitalization usage
22:20 - punctuation or
22:22 - spelling we show them all of the errors
22:25 - our AI models have detected
22:29 - they can choose to make changes to their
22:31 - essay to resolve an error or dismiss any
22:33 - error they disagree with before
22:35 - submitting their
22:38 - essay at every step of the process
22:40 - teachers can reinforce their students
22:42 - critical thinking skills they are
22:43 - receiving AI generated feedback but is
22:45 - it accurate how should a student react
22:47 - if they disagree one of our Middle
22:49 - School teachers summed it up this way
22:51 - the AI can only go so far you're the
22:53 - critical thinker here I need you to
22:54 - decide is that the word you meant or
22:57 - like that's a s
22:59 - fragment once the student has submitted
23:01 - their final draft of the essay the
23:03 - teacher will be able to review it one
23:05 - last
23:06 - time in the teacher application teachers
23:09 - will be able to see the final AI
23:10 - generated scores and make any necessary
23:13 - adjustments before the students see
23:15 - their
23:17 - score as you can see there are many
23:19 - steps in this flow where teachers will
23:21 - get the benefit of AI scoring and
23:23 - feedback generation to help make the
23:24 - review process faster for a whole
23:26 - classroom of students the insights
23:28 - report is available to help teachers
23:31 - once the assignment is started and will
23:33 - help them track class progress and begin
23:36 - to see patterns of common problem areas
23:38 - for their
23:40 - students a middle school Ela teacher who
23:42 - tested our prototype summed it up this
23:44 - way I mean it can grade papers in
23:46 - minutes where it takes me two to three
23:48 - weeks right this will help free up time
23:50 - for teachers to spend more time coaching
23:52 - their students based on how their
23:53 - students are performing and that's where
23:55 - teachers shine thank you

25:56 - this could include projects activities
25:58 - or sandbox environments where you can
26:00 - experiment with building simple AI
26:02 - models there are increasingly more
26:05 - professional development opportunities
26:06 - available let's learn more about one of
26:09 - these
26:10 - opportunities well at one point AI was
26:13 - in the distant future right well that
26:16 - future is now so as Educators we need to
26:20 - prepare our students to interact with AI
26:24 - in in safe thoughtful intelligent ways
26:27 - most of the time when people hear
26:29 - artificial intelligence especially a
26:30 - teacher you are a little intimidated so
26:33 - you're thinking I can't teach that I'm
26:36 - not that techsavvy I don't know that
26:38 - much about artificial intelligence but
26:40 - after going through the AI Explorations
26:42 - course I gained way more confidence even
26:45 - as I was going along the course so there
26:47 - were sometimes where there might have
26:48 - been a term or a concept that I was
26:50 - totally unfamiliar with but by the end
26:52 - of the lesson then I knew more so to
26:54 - become the learner first that is what
26:57 - really empowered me as an educator AI
26:59 - exploration provides a variety of free
27:02 - opportunities and resources from
27:04 - Educators from our online PD course to
27:08 - the Hands-On AI project guides to our
27:10 - webinar series and our pln community the
27:13 - AI Hands-On guide and the isty course
27:16 - that I took about artificial
27:17 - intelligence really gave me everything I
27:19 - needed to teach my fifth grade class
27:21 - about artificial intelligence I'm really
27:24 - inspired by the fact that they're able
27:25 - to grasp onto these Concepts and I've
27:27 - even had some students realize I could
27:29 - be that person to create something using
27:33 - artificial intelligence I think learning
27:35 - about AI is really fun AI impacts Our
27:39 - Lives cuz you use the Google search you
27:42 - use robots like Alexa and Siri and
27:46 - Google you use all sorts of things if I
27:49 - did create things in the future with AI
27:52 - I would make a robot that brings you
27:55 - snacks when you can just watch TV and
27:57 - stuff I really hope that students who
28:00 - experience this program most of all walk
28:03 - away feeling empowered feeling like
28:06 - artificial intelligence isn't just
28:07 - something that happens to them but it's
28:09 - something that they can control
28:11 - something that they can design something
28:13 - that they can influence something that
28:15 - they can bring their values
28:18 - to that brings us to the end of our
28:20 - journey together hopefully this Series
28:22 - has provided you with the knowledge and
28:24 - skills you need to start exploring and
28:27 - forming your own opinions about Ai and
28:30 - education visit the ai101 for teers
28:33 - website at code.org
28:36 - ai101 to revisit the videos in this
28:38 - series and explore additional resources
