00:04 - at the beginning of this unit students
00:06 - address the need for computers to have
00:07 - numeric addresses in order for messages
00:09 - to be routed properly to the destination
00:12 - but when humans open a web browser and
00:13 - want to request web page data from a
00:15 - computer we fortunately don't have to
00:17 - know or remember the numeric ip
00:19 - addresses for the server we can just
00:21 - type in www.code.org
00:24 - and our computer is somehow able to
00:26 - request the data from the right computer
00:28 - in this and the following lesson
00:30 - students will learn about the domain
00:32 - name system or dns a hierarchical system
00:35 - and protocol that maps human readable
00:37 - domain names such as code.org to the
00:39 - actual ip address of the computer
00:41 - serving the webpage
00:43 - dns is considered hierarchical because
00:46 - not all domain name servers in the
00:47 - system need to know about every single
00:49 - mapping from domain name to ip address
00:52 - for example there are certain servers
00:54 - that are responsible for the.org domain
00:56 - which know about the dns server is
00:58 - responsible for the subdomains under it
01:00 - this lesson primarily addresses concepts
01:02 - that fall under the csp big idea of the
01:05 - internet
01:07 - the getting started activity for this
01:08 - lesson is a bit more involved than usual
01:11 - and has you and your students up and
01:13 - moving around here's your worksheet for
01:14 - today and here's your ip address
01:18 - as your students walk in hand them each
01:20 - one of the ipa address cutouts and
01:22 - instruct them not to share the number
01:24 - with anyone else to kick off the
01:26 - activity let students know that their
01:27 - task is to get a complete mapping of
01:29 - everyone in the class's name with their
01:31 - ip address everybody grab a pen or a
01:33 - pencil
01:34 - and
01:36 - we're gonna you're gonna walk and talk
01:37 - to each other and you each have an ip
01:39 - address your job is to figure out
01:41 - everybody else's ip address in the room
01:44 - so you can write down their name and the
01:45 - ip address on their sheet now you can
01:47 - talk to each other one at a time and
01:48 - when you do you can exchange as much
01:50 - information as you want so if one of you
01:52 - already knows somebody else's you can
01:53 - exchange a whole bunch of them but you
01:55 - can only talk to one person at a time
01:57 - all right ready go for it
02:04 - i have an ikea address
02:06 - 205.22
02:08 - during the activity you will be covertly
02:10 - tapping the students on the shoulder one
02:12 - by one taking their current ip address
02:14 - and giving them a new one
02:16 - never mind this will cause their
02:17 - mappings to quickly become out of date
02:19 - and it will be difficult to get the
02:20 - latest information
02:22 - but i just gave it to like six people
02:24 - that is sorry it changes they change
02:26 - here's the new one it may not take long
02:28 - for students to get the point of the
02:30 - activity and reach an appropriate level
02:32 - of frustration
02:33 - once that happens bring the class
02:35 - together for a quick discussion
02:37 - the important points to draw out of the
02:39 - conversation are that number one
02:41 - ip addresses change all the time as your
02:44 - phone moves around with you you are
02:46 - constantly connecting to different
02:47 - routers and therefore getting a new ip
02:49 - address even servers serving up web
02:52 - pages like code.org can change ip
02:54 - addresses if its internet service
02:55 - provider changes
02:58 - number two having a centralized mapping
03:00 - for host names to ip addresses is better
03:02 - and more efficient design than having
03:04 - everyone keep a local mapping which can
03:06 - become out of date quickly
03:09 - having experienced first-hand the pain
03:11 - of not having a centralized system
03:13 - students will be well prepared to watch
03:14 - the dns section of the ipdns video
03:18 - to plug in the unplugged warm-up
03:20 - activity direct students to the internet
03:22 - simulator for the lesson in pairs but
03:24 - have pairs split up across the room so
03:26 - they can't talk to each other in person
03:28 - so you should see your partner and a
03:31 - yellow dns node
03:33 - although pairs will be connected to the
03:35 - same router in this version of the tool
03:37 - students won't be able to see the ip
03:39 - addresses of their partner so you're
03:41 - here you're monica 3 and you want to
03:43 - send a message to brad ford but you
03:45 - don't know his ip address so that's
03:48 - there right right it's question mark we
03:49 - don't know it yet okay but you do know
03:50 - the ip address of the dns
03:53 - so what we're going to do is send a
03:54 - message to dns
03:55 - and we're going to find out from dns
03:58 - what his address is the dns server in
04:01 - the simulator responds to requests
04:03 - formatted with a very specific protocol
04:05 - so you have to put get
04:07 - and then the host name and host name is
04:09 - going to be
04:11 - brad's address
04:14 - is it red four brad four yep it's get
04:17 - and then a space and then the host name
04:19 - of the person and if you look in the
04:21 - router diagram over here you can see the
04:22 - hostname is madi9 the server will
04:25 - respond to the ip with the ip address of
04:27 - the hostname requested which students
04:28 - can use to communicate with their
04:30 - partner to fill out a basic
04:31 - questionnaire it understood you so it
04:33 - told you brad's address is 2.13
04:37 - okay so now you can send a message
04:38 - directly to brad using that address
04:41 - however just like in the activity ip
04:43 - addresses are not forever if i come
04:45 - around and tap you on the shoulder i
04:47 - need you to disconnect from your router
04:49 - and then connect back to it
04:58 - so i uh i noticed that
05:01 - she left and came back
05:03 - so
05:04 - when i tried to send a message she
05:06 - didn't respond and i wouldn't ask the
05:08 - dns again
05:09 - and
05:10 - the dns came back and she had a
05:11 - different address that she had before
05:13 - okay great aside from getting to
05:15 - experience a basic dns request and
05:17 - response this activity is meaningful
05:19 - because it will be the first time that
05:20 - students actually have to follow a
05:22 - protocol precisely this is because there
05:25 - is actually a computer responding to the
05:26 - requests that only understand certain
05:28 - commands
