01:24 - b
01:43 - here we are
01:46 - yeah all right sophia already
01:50 - i think we're live really
01:53 - yeah okay
02:16 - hi everybody this is hadi partovi i'm
02:19 - the creator of the hour of code and the
02:21 - ceo of code.org and i'm here with my
02:23 - daughter
02:24 - sophia hi sophia and this is our first
02:27 - episode of code bytes
02:29 - uh you know this week is the computer
02:30 - science education week and collectively
02:32 - we're celebrating
02:34 - the hour of code which is you know this
02:36 - global celebration of computer science
02:39 - uh today and every day of this week
02:41 - millions of students all around the
02:43 - world are going to be coding
02:45 - and what's exciting wait let me turn off
02:47 - my background this is weird
02:48 - hold on a second i'm going to turn off
02:51 - my zoom background
02:52 - so um every day of this week millions of
02:56 - students around the world are going to
02:57 - be doing the hour of code
02:58 - and this is an idea the hour of code is
03:00 - something that i came up with
03:02 - just eight years ago and it's been
03:03 - incredible that over the past eight
03:05 - years
03:05 - one billion times an hour of code has
03:08 - been done
03:09 - uh now today we're not going to be
03:10 - together for an entire hour this is
03:12 - going to be fast we're calling this code
03:13 - bytes
03:14 - uh because it's little bite-sized
03:16 - lessons so we're going to be together
03:18 - for about
03:18 - maybe 20 25 minutes i know lots of
03:22 - students have school days whether you're
03:23 - in school or whether you're doing remote
03:25 - learning
03:25 - we want to support students doing an
03:28 - hour of code and you're part of
03:29 - something much much larger than the
03:31 - hundreds of students that are online
03:33 - right now uh you know
03:34 - because there's going to be literally
03:36 - millions of people around the world
03:37 - coding today uh sophia are you ready
03:40 - sure all right so first we're gonna
03:43 - today we're gonna learn
03:45 - about artificial intelligence
03:48 - or a.i sophia do you know what
03:51 - artificial intelligence is
03:53 - yeah um okay i always say get the
03:56 - um definition mixed up but um it's a
03:59 - computer or
04:01 - like a technology that um doesn't need
04:04 - to be explicitly
04:05 - programmed to do something yeah that's
04:08 - really
04:09 - advanced we've explained it ai is
04:11 - generally just
04:12 - when a computer does something that
04:13 - seems really smart like it's got
04:15 - it seems to have human intelligence and
04:17 - it's a way of programming computers to
04:19 - learn
04:20 - um but before we talk about this i want
04:22 - to find out where all of our students
04:24 - are from
04:24 - we had a qr code at the beginning for
04:26 - people to show where they are on the map
04:28 - but instead of using that i'm going to
04:29 - ask everybody to use the chat so if you
04:31 - click on the little chat button at the
04:32 - bottom of your screen
04:34 - if you're in the chat uh choose a little
04:37 - drop down that looks like this that says
04:39 - to all panelists and attendees
04:42 - that way you'll be able to types and
04:43 - everybody can see what you type
04:45 - and if you could just type in the
04:46 - location you're calling in from
04:48 - so we can see where everybody's calling
04:50 - from i hope this works
04:54 - maybe you need to enable the chat the
04:57 - chat might be i'm
04:58 - not enabled for people uh-oh
05:01 - also a serious problem here where's my
05:04 - bug
05:05 - we don't don't worry about that all
05:07 - right it does look like the chat is
05:09 - enabled but let's go on to learning
05:10 - about ai
05:11 - so what we're going to do is we're going
05:12 - to teach a computer
05:14 - how to recognize stuff but let me first
05:17 - start by saying
05:18 - um if if uh
05:22 - to do this together with sophia sophia
05:24 - i'm going to show you a face and you
05:26 - tell me if i'm angry or i'm sad
05:28 - okay ready set go
05:31 - i think that's angry how about this
05:34 - that's happy at least it should be
05:39 - okay so you can recognize my face easily
05:41 - now but what's
05:42 - what a i can try to do is recognize that
05:44 - same thing but what happens if you don't
05:46 - see the entire face
05:48 - now what am i that's still angry
05:51 - how about this
05:54 - happy i think maybe surprised
05:57 - i i don't know that's not really scared
06:00 - but i'm
06:01 - sad how about if i show you this way
06:09 - [Music]
06:11 - so i'm showing you that because ai can
06:13 - sometimes recognize things like humans
06:15 - and sometimes it can do even better
06:16 - because it sees more than the
06:18 - than just a part of the picture so we're
06:20 - going to go
06:21 - use a tutorial where we can teach an ai
06:24 - something
06:25 - so give me just one second i'm going to
06:27 - share my screen
06:29 - sharing screen so where we are
06:33 - is that the code.org ai for oceans
06:35 - tutorial
06:38 - and what you can see is uh
06:42 - this ai for oceans where you can program
06:44 - something to
06:45 - program the ai if you go into it we're
06:47 - going to program ai to recognize fish
06:50 - and to distinguish what is fish and what
06:52 - is not fish
06:53 - so to help clean the oceans so sophia
06:56 - the more we program this the better ai
06:58 - learns so tell me is this a fish
07:00 - no are you sure i think so
07:04 - all right it's not a fish how about that
07:06 - no nothing she just rotated
07:09 - how about this one that's a fish this
07:11 - one's a fish
07:12 - how about this yes this is a fish that's
07:14 - a fish
07:16 - yes to fish i think that's a fish
07:19 - of course it's a fish what about that
07:21 - kind of looks like a fish when you first
07:22 - see it i know it's not
07:23 - not a fish and look over here is showing
07:26 - how many times we've trained ai
07:28 - so how about this that's a fish how
07:31 - about this
07:32 - that's a fish that's not a fish not a
07:35 - fish
07:36 - yes a fish no definitely not a fish
07:40 - not a fish it should know this one by
07:42 - now but so now we've given
07:43 - ai 13 different things to go from do you
07:45 - think that's enough for it to learn
07:47 - i don't think so well let's continue and
07:49 - see what happens
07:51 - so now ai's gonna get to decide on its
07:55 - own based on the training we gave it we
07:56 - gave it 13 examples let's see how
07:59 - how well it learned i don't think it's
08:01 - gonna work
08:06 - see what dad you couldn't put a gasoline
08:09 - in the ocean
08:12 - so we can go quickly so okay it is doing
08:15 - a really really bad job
08:17 - let's see and if i finish continuing to
08:20 - see all the things that it's trained
08:25 - so this shows what it put in the ocean
08:26 - it said all of these
08:28 - classified these as fish yeah and if we
08:31 - see what it says was
08:32 - not fish okay it did pretty well at
08:34 - recognizing the not fish it didn't put
08:36 - any
08:37 - fish into the trash well
08:40 - so now if we want we can click to train
08:42 - more
08:43 - to get it a little bit smarter so help
08:45 - me a little bit out with this
08:46 - is this fish yes
08:49 - fish fish you can also do this the way
08:53 - where you try to get all the garbage
08:55 - into the ocean for fun but in real life
08:57 - you probably should that's not
08:59 - fun that is not fun
09:02 - so i'm gonna do this fast because i know
09:04 - what's fishing that's fish that's fish
09:06 - that's fish that's fish
09:09 - that's fish all right now let's see if
09:11 - it does much better we gave it 28
09:13 - examples
09:14 - so tell me is the computer doing well
09:16 - wait
09:18 - but when i did this i gave it like 130
09:21 - examples just to be
09:22 - safe there's a tire in there
09:27 - did it still make a mistake ah it's
09:29 - still making mistakes
09:31 - so what we realized is to get ai to get
09:33 - actually smart to do recognition
09:35 - you need to give it a lot more training
09:37 - than what we did so even though we gave
09:38 - it 28 examples
09:40 - that was still not enough to recognize
09:42 - fish from trash
09:44 - so you can see it still is putting all
09:46 - sorts of garbage in the ocean wait but
09:48 - we see the locker
09:49 - you want to see the not garbage right
09:51 - you get a fish in there
09:54 - dad you created them
09:57 - you did better when before with less
10:00 - training it did better yeah oh that's
10:02 - terrible
10:03 - you're you're taking out the fish now
10:06 - right so one of the things we
10:07 - i want to show is how ai can actually be
10:10 - used to train a computer something that
10:11 - it didn't know
10:12 - and by the way check it out the the chat
10:15 - has now been turned on
10:16 - so now people can type everywhere that
10:18 - they're from so they're calling from
10:20 - india from arizona from lebanon
10:23 - maharashtra indiana texas
10:26 - canada michigan new york it's going
10:30 - super fast only like see colorado
10:33 - massachusetts
10:34 - georgia miami toronto
10:38 - it is going way too fast to see all this
10:41 - that's pretty awesome
10:44 - all right so one of the things i want to
10:45 - show is we just showed how to recognize
10:47 - fish from not fish but we can teach ai
10:49 - to do
10:50 - other things as well so let's teach the
10:52 - ai how to recognize a word
10:54 - that it never learned before all right
10:56 - so let me
10:57 - share the screen again one second
11:03 - all right so now we want to teach the ai
11:05 - a new word
11:07 - so everybody who's there chatting can
11:09 - you all instead of chatting
11:11 - where you're from look at these words on
11:13 - screen
11:14 - and tell me what word should we teach ai
11:17 - we want to teach it to recognize a type
11:18 - of fish
11:19 - it could be a delicious fish it could be
11:21 - a happy fish
11:23 - it could be a playful fish
11:28 - people are saying scary fun
11:30 - [Music]
11:32 - silly personal favorite is delicious
11:36 - all right let's choose from the ones
11:37 - that people have chosen scary is coming
11:40 - up a lot so i'm going to choose scary
11:41 - we're going to teach
11:42 - what's a scary fish all right so is that
11:45 - scary
11:46 - that fish just looks quite funny
11:50 - all right this one's not scary right no
11:53 - but the next one is
11:54 - this one is definitely scary look at
11:56 - those angry eyes
11:57 - spooky how about this one no not scary
12:01 - how about this one not scary
12:05 - not scary this one's got funny teeth
12:08 - but scary but but it's really kind eyes
12:11 - what do you say for this one
12:12 - yeah not scary definitely not
12:16 - not scary right this fish looks kind of
12:20 - scary right
12:21 - now definitely the next one does and
12:23 - this one is definitely scary
12:26 - this one's not so scary so sophia can
12:28 - you go through this really quickly and
12:29 - do like
12:30 - 50 of them or even more that one's kind
12:33 - of
12:33 - yeah go quickly without talking about it
12:35 - so as sophia's training this
12:37 - there's a couple of things to think
12:38 - about one is what are the features of
12:40 - the fist she's looking at
12:41 - to decide what is or isn't scary is she
12:44 - looking at the eyes is she looking at
12:46 - the mouth
12:47 - there's another question which is is it
12:48 - even fair to decide whether fish is
12:51 - scary or not based on its looks
12:53 - now maybe for an animal that might be
12:54 - fair but when ai is
12:56 - being trained when we train machine
12:59 - machines to do things based on what they
13:01 - see
13:02 - there's a really important question are
13:03 - we teaching them to be fair or not fair
13:05 - and in fact did you know that scientists
13:07 - in
13:09 - in europe are already training ai
13:13 - to recognize from human faces whether
13:15 - somebody looks trustworthy or not
13:17 - that's a terrible way to use ai to
13:19 - suggest that
13:20 - a computer can detect whether or not
13:22 - they can trust you based on the look of
13:24 - your face that's just not fair at all
13:26 - so it's really important when people
13:29 - train ai
13:30 - why is this fish where's the mouth of
13:32 - the fish it's got a really big
13:34 - separated from the fish's body
13:37 - all right that's scary so my point from
13:40 - what i was saying is just because you
13:41 - can train a computer to do something it
13:43 - doesn't necessarily mean it's a good
13:44 - thing to do that
13:45 - so training to recognize whether a fish
13:47 - is scary or not that may just sound kind
13:49 - of fun
13:50 - but doing that with human faces and
13:51 - trying to decide if somebody is
13:52 - trustworthy based on their look is not
13:54 - okay
13:55 - so we've done this 59 times now let's
13:57 - see did ai learn what
13:59 - sofia believes is scary yeah this is my
14:01 - opinion
14:02 - yeah it's important to know that we just
14:04 - taught it sophia's biased opinion of
14:06 - what is or isn't scary somebody else
14:08 - might choose something different
14:11 - so somebody might have thought those
14:12 - sharp teeth were scary
14:15 - so let's go through this really fast and
14:17 - get a whole bunch of
14:18 - fish that one with a smile was not scary
14:22 - did you see it okay
14:26 - all right so i'm continuing on these are
14:27 - all the scary things okay
14:29 - that squiggly one at the very bottom
14:32 - this one
14:33 - yeah that's kind of funny but one of
14:35 - these was just not scary at all
14:37 - let's see like we can look in fact if
14:39 - you click on one if you click on this
14:41 - one you can click on the i
14:43 - and find out why did it think it was
14:44 - scary because it had scary eyes
14:48 - right there how come this one was scary
14:51 - its
14:52 - eyes weren't scary but it thought its
14:53 - body and its tail and its mouth were
14:55 - scary
14:56 - that's
15:00 - yeah yeah this one its eyes weren't
15:03 - scary but because it had a dorsal fin
15:05 - and a scary looking tail and i think
15:08 - we've labeled enough of the s-shaped
15:09 - fish this
15:10 - snake scary that i just thought all the
15:12 - snakes are scary because it has a scary
15:14 - looking body
15:15 - so you can tell why ai thinks different
15:18 - things are scary like this has scary
15:20 - eyes
15:20 - or this has
15:23 - this one it's because of its eyes but
15:25 - also its mouth
15:27 - so ai doesn't know what is or isn't
15:30 - scary
15:31 - it is learning from what you tell it and
15:33 - you gave it only 58 examples and that's
15:35 - what it's going from
15:36 - so obviously when you train a real
15:38 - computer to do stuff using ai
15:40 - it needs a lot more information than
15:41 - that but since we have only 20 minutes
15:44 - to go
15:45 - or 20 minutes total we have about less
15:47 - than about 10 minutes to go
15:49 - we don't have enough time to train it
15:50 - with enough data now i want to train
15:53 - something
15:53 - more complicated to show ai which is
15:56 - american sign language
15:58 - does anybody know what sign language is
16:00 - what is sign language
16:01 - used for it's um
16:04 - a language used for people that can't
16:07 - people that are deaf
16:08 - people who can't hear or people who
16:10 - can't speak if somebody can't speak they
16:12 - also need to use signs
16:14 - and also if they can't hear they need to
16:15 - use signs as well so i want to
16:18 - teach a computer to recognize a very
16:20 - short word
16:22 - using sign language so if you google
16:25 - sign language this is the american sign
16:27 - language but
16:28 - i want to teach it to recognize code so
16:32 - we're going to make a code spelling so
16:34 - can you spell this out
16:36 - how do you spell a c that's a c
16:39 - and then do an o o
16:42 - and then do a d it's a d and then an
16:45 - e that's an e great so now we want to
16:48 - take a computer to recognize those
16:51 - letters from each other
16:52 - we're going to go into something called
16:53 - teachable machine you can just google
16:55 - teachable machine to find it
16:58 - and we're going to make an image project
17:00 - which is going to recognize different
17:01 - images
17:02 - and we're going to make it recognize a
17:05 - bunch of things the letter
17:07 - c we're going to differentiate that from
17:09 - the letter
17:11 - o and then
17:14 - the letter d and then lastly
17:19 - the letter e we want to teach it all of
17:22 - these
17:22 - letters so we're going to use our webcam
17:26 - to train it
17:27 - what okay
17:30 - okay sophia we're using one camera to
17:32 - show us up here
17:34 - and a different camera that's now being
17:36 - trained over here so you show the letter
17:38 - c make it a good one
17:42 - and i'm going to click hold to record
17:44 - and now move it around a little bit
17:46 - keep doing it okay we gave it 18 images
17:49 - of c
17:51 - that's enough no that's okay it'll make
17:53 - mistakes
17:54 - i'm gonna keep changing these cameras
17:56 - here do you want okay now show the
17:58 - letter o
17:59 - make it really different than the c
18:01 - ready i'm going to record it
18:02 - bring it bring your hand closer a little
18:04 - bit move it around
18:07 - okay we have 20 images of o's now we're
18:10 - going to do a letter
18:11 - d this shouldn't quite recognize it
18:14 - my finger ready okay
18:17 - [Music]
18:21 - all right and then lastly the letter e
18:24 - each time we're doing this we're giving
18:26 - the computer example images make sure
18:28 - this doesn't look like an
18:29 - o i don't think it does at least i don't
18:32 - think it does either but the computer
18:34 - might get confused
18:35 - so now that we did that we're going to
18:38 - train the model
18:38 - we've given it 23 images of these 20
18:42 - 20 that has about 80 different images to
18:44 - look at as its training
18:46 - which that adds up to a lot more than
18:48 - the you know
18:49 - 15 fish that we showed it but that's not
18:51 - a lot of images
18:52 - so the question is is that going to be
18:54 - enough for the computer to learn how to
18:56 - do this or not
18:57 - training an ai the more images you get
18:59 - it the better it's going to get and in
19:01 - fact
19:01 - when computer scientists use this when
19:03 - when people talk about cars that learn
19:05 - to drive themselves
19:07 - they're training the ai to recognize
19:09 - street signs what is a pedestrian what
19:11 - is a road
19:12 - have you ever been on a website where
19:15 - the website asks you
19:16 - which of these things are traffic lights
19:18 - or which of these things or something
19:19 - else
19:21 - yeah you're actually when you're doing
19:22 - that you're training an ai
19:24 - to to do this uh to recognize
19:27 - street things from each other so now
19:29 - let's see our ai has
19:31 - already been trained and let me change
19:33 - the webcam
19:34 - and it's already yelling okay all right
19:37 - so now show it the letter c
19:41 - and look over here it says with 70
19:44 - likelihood
19:45 - it knows this way
19:48 - it knows that that's a c now show an o
19:52 - and no it definitely got that you have
19:54 - an o
19:55 - now show letter d it's having trouble
19:59 - with that one bring it down a little bit
20:00 - or move it
20:01 - oh it got it yeah it knows that that's a
20:03 - d and i'll show the e
20:08 - it's struggling with this one if you
20:10 - move it a little bit so basically as
20:12 - you're
20:12 - recognizing down here the computer can
20:14 - tell what you're doing
20:16 - and now i want to show something else we
20:17 - can do this with this you can
20:20 - export this model and we just train the
20:23 - ai and we can
20:24 - upload what we trained to the internet
20:28 - what yeah you haven't seen this before
20:30 - and now we have a url
20:32 - this right here is a web page that can
20:35 - recognize what we just did or we can
20:37 - even take this
20:38 - and put it in code so i over here
20:42 - have code that i've written to make our
20:44 - own web page
20:46 - if i hit play and we can edit the code
20:50 - to do whatever we want with it
20:53 - wait for the camera to start wait for it
20:56 - ready come on
21:06 - all right maybe it's not going to go
21:09 - well let's try this
21:10 - other way that's actually quite funny
21:12 - okay
21:13 - so if i take this model
21:16 - that we copied i can open it in a new
21:19 - new url
21:24 - and look here's a web page that's a
21:25 - brand new web page that you can
21:27 - basically
21:29 - turn on maybe it's having trouble
21:31 - because of
21:32 - my other camera being on well
21:36 - when it does work oh here it is so
21:39 - here's this camera that finally turned
21:40 - on it's very glitchy though
21:43 - it's glitchy can you show it the letter
21:45 - o it got it
21:46 - try the letter put the letter
21:50 - d it's having trouble my finger is right
21:54 - there there i got it i'll put the letter
21:56 - e
21:59 - it's confusing the d and the e because
22:01 - i'm not seeing your finger but
22:03 - now let's see if how it does with my
22:04 - hand it got the letter c
22:07 - you got the letter it doesn't get the
22:10 - letter okay
22:17 - okay if it doesn't work very well for my
22:19 - hand because we only trained it on your
22:20 - hand
22:21 - sideway so what we just saw there is we
22:25 - just trained the ai
22:26 - how to recognize the sign language those
22:29 - four letters using your hand but we
22:31 - didn't train it using my hand
22:33 - and so the computer can only see when
22:35 - you're showing signs
22:36 - not what i'm doing and this shows
22:37 - another part of what it means to train
22:40 - an ai and how to avoid training bias
22:42 - because if you train an ai to learn and
22:45 - recognize
22:45 - only one type of thing from one type of
22:48 - person
22:48 - and not a broad representation of people
22:51 - you don't get as good a sense
22:53 - of how it works or you know it might not
22:55 - work fairly or equally for some people
22:58 - this happens very much in today's day
23:00 - you know as people are training
23:01 - computers to
23:02 - recognize diseases imagine if it
23:05 - recognizes
23:06 - a disease better among women than among
23:08 - men
23:09 - or better among people with white skin
23:11 - than people with dark skin
23:13 - and it's really important this is
23:14 - actually happening in today's world
23:16 - computers need to be trained
23:17 - with a broad representation of images so
23:20 - that they get
23:20 - get the answer right in a way that is
23:22 - fair for everybody that's looking at it
23:26 - all right so we are now getting at the
23:27 - end of our lesson we promised that these
23:29 - would be short
23:30 - uh thank you for joining us for computer
23:32 - science education week
23:33 - if you want to try using ai for oceans
23:35 - yourself to train
23:37 - a computer to recognize a fish from
23:39 - trash or teach your own world
23:41 - go to code.org at home
23:44 - all of our lessons that students can
23:46 - learn at home are listed over there and
23:47 - look for ai for oceans
23:49 - or if you want to use teachable machine
23:50 - like we did you could just google
23:52 - teachable machine
23:54 - and go to that website and you can teach
23:56 - nai to recognize a smile from an angry
23:58 - face
23:59 - you can teach it to recognize sign
24:01 - language or you can teach your computer
24:03 - to play rock paper scissors
24:04 - by teaching it a rock and a paper and
24:07 - scissors
24:08 - that all of those are possible using
24:10 - that teachable machine tool that we
24:11 - showed
24:12 - so go try on your own to see what you
24:14 - can teach ai to do
24:16 - and learn more about how computers do
24:18 - computer vision and by the way if you're
24:19 - enjoying learning about ai
24:21 - just this week we launched something new
24:24 - which i want to show you
24:26 - if you go to code.org ai
24:30 - and i'm going to share my screen one
24:31 - last time to show this
24:38 - where's my screen here it is
24:42 - so we have if you go to code.org ai this
24:45 - is an entire page about artificial
24:47 - intelligence
24:48 - and you can see the ai for oceans that
24:50 - we did
24:51 - there's also this new video series how
24:53 - ai
24:54 - works which talks about what is machine
24:56 - learning
24:57 - what is training data and bias what are
24:59 - neural networks
25:00 - how does computer vision work and two
25:03 - different videos about
25:04 - ethics and ai which are really important
25:06 - the questions of equal access
25:08 - algorithmic bias data privacy and the
25:11 - future of work when computers are
25:13 - starting to automate jobs
25:14 - using artificial intelligence that video
25:17 - series is at code.org
25:19 - ai and it's something you can watch
25:20 - yourselves and
25:22 - families can watch it together with
25:23 - parents or with uh
25:25 - with their children or even with your
25:26 - grandparents uh
25:28 - thank you everybody for joining us have
25:30 - a wonderful computer science education
25:31 - week
25:32 - and we'll see you we're going to be
25:34 - doing this every day this week so we'll
25:36 - see you tomorrow
25:38 - say bye bye
25:41 - yay
