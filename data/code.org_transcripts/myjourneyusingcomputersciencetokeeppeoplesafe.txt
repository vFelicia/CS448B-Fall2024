00:07 - oh and good morning everyone thank you
00:10 - to all the classrooms tuning in for
00:13 - today's my journey class chat my name is
00:16 - victoria chavez i am
00:18 - the state policy fellow at code.org on
00:21 - our advocacy team today we're excited to
00:23 - welcome richard nelson who is part of a
00:26 - team that plays a crucial role in
00:27 - technology to keep people safe at
00:30 - motorola
00:31 - with a background in mechanical
00:32 - engineering business and computer
00:34 - science richard also enjoys helping
00:37 - underrepresented students with their
00:38 - future goals and technology
00:41 - teachers please let us know where you're
00:42 - tuning in from and put your students
00:44 - questions for richard in the q a and
00:46 - we'll try our best to get to some of
00:47 - those during the chat today
00:49 - we'll start with a fun icebreaker to get
00:51 - us started
00:53 - and so
00:54 - richard as you are introducing yourself
00:58 - if you can let us know your go-to
01:01 - comfort food
01:05 - good morning victoria that's a great
01:07 - question um so
01:09 - go to comfort food i i think a lot of
01:11 - people think of like dessert uh when you
01:13 - pick up comfort food but for me my go-to
01:15 - comfort food is the same exact food is
01:17 - like my favorite food overall um that's
01:19 - mac and cheese so i love both my mom and
01:22 - my wife's mac and cheese so i like it's
01:24 - like i could literally eat that every
01:25 - day when i was in college i thought i
01:26 - could eat it every day but it's not you
01:28 - know eating the little easy mac is not
01:30 - the same as the homemade
01:32 - uh you know mac and cheese that you know
01:34 - that i love one makes so if i can eat
01:36 - something every day that would
01:37 - definitely be it so i definitely might
01:38 - go to comfort food oh that sounds
01:40 - awesome i'm not absolutely the dessert
01:43 - person cookies chocolate all the sweet
01:46 - stuff that's my go-to food but homie mac
01:48 - and cheese is really delicious i agree
01:52 - beautiful thank you so much um so thank
01:55 - you for do you wanna
01:57 - share anything uh before we get started
02:00 - with the with the questions a little bit
02:01 - about yourself
02:02 - sure uh so a little bit about i mean i
02:04 - know you gave a great intro um my
02:06 - background is in mechanical engineering
02:08 - and computer science and business um i'm
02:10 - from south florida originally so i'm
02:12 - really excited to be able to share some
02:13 - of my experience with uh with all the
02:15 - classrooms that are dialed in today um
02:17 - and if you have any questions feel free
02:18 - to feel free to share them
02:20 - beautiful thank you so much richard so
02:22 - to get started can you tell us a little
02:25 - bit about what you do
02:27 - sure thing so i'm actually going to
02:29 - share my screen to show a little bit of
02:31 - some illustrations that kind of
02:32 - highlight a little bit about what i've
02:33 - done here at motorola so far
02:38 - so
02:40 - uh am i sharing okay everything good yep
02:42 - perfect okay so
02:44 - starting off so i started i joined
02:46 - monroe back in 2019 um as a mechanical
02:48 - engineer so a lot of what i did uh was
02:52 - supporting our current products that are
02:53 - in the field and
02:55 - first off about you know motorola
02:56 - solutions um i know you might you hear
02:58 - motorola you probably think of like the
03:00 - razer you know like
03:01 - the classic most iconic cell phones uh
03:04 - yep
03:05 - so nowadays you make mission critical
03:07 - radios right so one of the things and
03:09 - i'll talk a little bit more about that
03:11 - um in a minute but from the mechanical
03:13 - engineering side what that means is that
03:15 - we're making radios for our customers
03:16 - which largely include you know
03:18 - firefighters police officers emt in the
03:20 - military it's really important that um
03:23 - the products that we're making are
03:24 - extremely rugged and durable so that way
03:27 - they can survive in the environments
03:28 - that our customers are using them in
03:30 - because when they're there are everyday
03:31 - heroes
03:32 - so
03:33 - one of the things that mechanical
03:34 - engineer that i did a lot of is testing
03:35 - for example so here on the left i have a
03:38 - video of uh for
03:40 - all you know everyone who's team iphone
03:42 - you might cringe seeing this video this
03:44 - is a steel ball dropping onto an iphone
03:46 - screen um don't know whose phone that is
03:50 - but uh it's just like i just for you
03:52 - know illustrator comparison comparison
03:54 - um now what you'll see is one of our
03:57 - newer apex next radios which has you
03:59 - know also has a touchscreen on it and
04:01 - you can see how the screen does not
04:02 - shatter uh so there's a lot of
04:04 - engineering that goes into you know
04:06 - designing products to be that rugged and
04:09 - then here on the right you know this is
04:11 - an example of something the impact
04:12 - testing that we do now funny enough i i
04:16 - didn't have a video handy um showing a
04:18 - radio but i did have a radio uh
04:21 - featuring a football so we did this for
04:22 - our bring a child to work the event last
04:24 - year um so in your mind just imagine
04:27 - there being a radio there instead of a
04:28 - football
04:29 - but what we typically use this machine
04:31 - for is to actually um it so to speak
04:34 - bring the floor to the radio because we
04:35 - do a lot of drop testing um so
04:38 - a lot of times we'll drop radios from
04:39 - various heights to make sure they can
04:41 - survive that impact in this case we've
04:43 - been the force the radio to try to
04:45 - simulate a direct impact at a certain
04:47 - point uh so
04:49 - that's of course you know we have a
04:50 - little bit of fun every now and then
04:52 - as always um so we have like that was a
04:55 - great great thing we did in celebration
04:56 - of a college football season but that's
04:59 - a little bit about what we do from the
05:00 - testing side and all that testing fuels
05:03 - a lot of our design work um when it
05:05 - comes to doing uh you know designing
05:08 - radios for portable um situations where
05:11 - let's say like a firefighter helping
05:12 - officer on their hip um or for you know
05:15 - mobile situations such as a police
05:18 - officer having like a radio in their car
05:20 - i think you know all types of radios
05:22 - we're designing we're designing and
05:23 - testing and simulating it's really fun
05:25 - really hands-on so i've had i had a lot
05:27 - of fun in that role and then my recent
05:29 - role i transitioned to a new team where
05:31 - i'm actually
05:33 - working as a product manager
05:35 - and
05:36 - to kind of highlight what i'm doing in
05:38 - this new role is i'm learning a lot more
05:39 - about cloud technology so in the photos
05:41 - on the left these are some photos from
05:43 - you know right after hurricane katrina
05:45 - so when natural disasters like this
05:46 - happen you know it's super important
05:47 - that public safety officials are able to
05:49 - communicate now they can't just rely on
05:52 - the same cell service that we rely on
05:54 - every day because i mean just just
05:55 - imagine that if you were in the
05:57 - situation most most people's first
05:58 - response is
06:00 - i need to find out if my loved ones are
06:01 - safe right so everyone's on the phone
06:03 - everyone's calling and
06:05 - i kind of
06:06 - you know make a comparison to when
06:07 - you're at home if everyone is like
06:09 - watching netflix at the same time your
06:11 - your internet speed is probably going to
06:12 - go down on your device because it's kind
06:14 - of
06:14 - you know everyone's you know using up
06:17 - that bandwidth same thing kind of what
06:19 - happens in real life uh for
06:21 - um communications so if everyone's using
06:24 - that bandwidth on them from their cell
06:25 - phones it can you know it can actually
06:27 - cause calls to drop um
06:30 - in communications to fail so police
06:32 - officers and um in the you know in the
06:34 - in the military when they're coming out
06:36 - to help help out and save people they
06:38 - have to rely on their own radio
06:40 - frequencies to be able to communicate so
06:42 - a lot of that you know supporting
06:43 - hardware and infrastructure that that's
06:45 - on their sites to help do that a lot of
06:47 - that we're moving to the cloud to make
06:49 - it even more resilient so that way in
06:50 - these type of situations if they have
06:52 - just even more confidence that when they
06:54 - make a call to help you know to try to
06:56 - dispatch someone out to save someone
06:58 - that that call will go through and work
07:03 - this is this is incredible thank you so
07:05 - much richard how how did you decide to
07:07 - do this work i mean this sounds really
07:09 - incredible
07:10 - oh a great question so
07:13 - uh i have one one other video as well
07:15 - that i want to share that kind of helps
07:16 - illustrate that so when i learned a
07:18 - little bit more about motorola does
07:20 - right
07:21 - it really piques my interest in the
07:22 - company
07:23 - and i think one of the best things that
07:25 - kind of illustrates this is looking at
07:26 - some situations that you know our
07:27 - customers are in so on the screen you
07:29 - see a video of firefighters running out
07:31 - of a burning building and you can see
07:33 - how a lot of them are engulfed by the
07:34 - flame right um so this is this actually
07:37 - happened in los angeles california about
07:40 - two years ago and it was incredible
07:42 - seeing this footage this is just coming
07:44 - straight off of youtube um and seeing
07:46 - this
07:46 - on the news seeing this on youtube i was
07:49 - like wow this is like insane um i've i
07:51 - mean i can't imagine being in that type
07:52 - of situation now working here at
07:54 - motorola you know i i learned that we
07:57 - actually provide the radios to this
08:00 - firefighter team in los angeles
08:01 - california and they were
08:03 - the photos on the right on the right
08:05 - show the actual after images of what
08:07 - their products look like um we actually
08:09 - were able to talk to the fire chief and
08:11 - you know he basically retold the story
08:13 - of what was going on before that that
08:15 - that flame basically engulfed half of
08:17 - the half of the fire ladder um and they
08:19 - were really able to get out just in the
08:21 - nick of time if they hadn't been able to
08:23 - communicate effectively you know they
08:25 - wouldn't have been able to save the
08:26 - lives that they saved and get out safely
08:28 - no one died in that incident which was
08:30 - amazing we love we'd love to hear those
08:32 - type of stories um and the incredible
08:34 - part from the engineering side is that
08:37 - looking at some of these photos on the
08:38 - right i mean these look pretty beat up
08:40 - because they literally were in fire
08:41 - right i mean they were on fire for you
08:43 - know for a good while when they were
08:45 - coming down that ladder every single
08:46 - device you see on the screen still works
08:48 - somehow which is incredible
08:50 - i it's kind of amazing looking at this
08:52 - when i when i when i received this
08:53 - package at my desk um when i got to the
08:55 - office it i opened it up and it smelled
08:57 - like a barbecue but nonetheless when i
08:58 - put a battery on you know i was able to
09:00 - turn the radio on and it still worked
09:02 - which is amazing so it's kind of a
09:03 - tribute to the type of engineering work
09:04 - we do here at motorola and that's what
09:06 - not only lord middle motorola but also
09:08 - definitely helps
09:10 - keep my interest in staying here at
09:11 - motorola
09:14 - wow that is that is so impressive thank
09:16 - you so much for sharing and these images
09:18 - are really telling of the work that
09:20 - you're doing how you're how you're
09:22 - saving lives which is really really cool
09:24 - um
09:25 - as a before we move on as a reminder to
09:27 - our audience feel free to drop some
09:29 - questions in the chat and we will we
09:31 - will ask ricky the questions from your
09:33 - classes
09:36 - while
09:37 - teachers start collecting some questions
09:39 - and
09:40 - students are thinking about what what
09:41 - they want to ask i'm sure they have tons
09:43 - of questions there's there's so much
09:45 - that can be asked about
09:47 - what you've said so far
09:49 - i'm really curious to know what role
09:51 - does computer science play and what you
09:53 - do
09:54 - oh great question so it plays a variety
09:56 - of roles actually i i know i'm a
09:58 - mechanical engineer by trade um but
10:02 - as a you know having the cs minor has
10:04 - really helped me out a lot and being
10:05 - able to automate things uh so i'll give
10:07 - an example so
10:09 - one of the things that we do
10:11 - is actually collect data on radio so
10:14 - this is a a video of me inside of one of
10:18 - our labs at work and in the background
10:20 - you guys see you see a whole bunch of
10:21 - wires and like uh and you know pieces of
10:24 - equipment that are all hooked up
10:25 - together it looks really complicated but
10:27 - in a nutshell what that all that stuff
10:29 - does um is it basically on one side you
10:33 - can actually plug in a radio um right
10:36 - and
10:37 - it it basically connects like a knob on
10:39 - a radio so it measures something called
10:41 - torque torque is basically just like the
10:43 - force required to turn something right
10:45 - just so you could just think of it from
10:47 - that perspective so on one side you have
10:49 - a radio on the other side you have a
10:50 - laptop that basically outputs the data
10:53 - so i'm going to fast forward a little
10:54 - bit to the end
10:55 - and you can actually see
10:57 - an example and yes i i could not find a
10:59 - good still shot so every every single
11:01 - one of these shots i wind up making an
11:02 - awkward phase it's really weird
11:04 - but nonetheless this is an example of
11:08 - some of the output data that we get so
11:10 - two things that i want to mention here
11:12 - in terms of why computer science is
11:13 - really important so
11:15 - one
11:15 - um i was actually able to write a script
11:18 - that
11:18 - automatically analyzes this data and
11:20 - gives me a lot of the important detail
11:22 - because just looking at the screen you
11:24 - know as an engineer there's some there's
11:26 - some um deductions that i can make about
11:28 - the design in terms of like if if things
11:30 - are good or things need to be improved
11:33 - but if i wanted to communicate this more
11:34 - effectively and be able to you know
11:37 - speed up my design process to make
11:39 - things better it would be nice to be
11:40 - able to just kind of take this file put
11:42 - it into a script and have it analyze it
11:44 - for me so i was actually able to write a
11:45 - script to do that now what exactly does
11:47 - the stuff on the screen mean uh it what
11:50 - this really does is like i said it
11:51 - measures the amount of force required to
11:53 - turn so imagine if again you're a police
11:55 - officer and let's say you see you know
11:58 - uh a criminal steal someone's uh
12:00 - backpack right and they're running down
12:01 - the street and you're chasing after them
12:03 - and your radio's on your hip and uh you
12:06 - need to call for backup right as you're
12:07 - running um if your radio you know if the
12:10 - volume knob is really really loose so it
12:12 - it rubs against you and your radio
12:14 - accident turns off that would be a
12:16 - problem because then when you pick up
12:17 - your radio and try to make a you know
12:19 - try to push to talk you know your radio
12:21 - is not going to make a call and and
12:22 - those seconds are really really
12:24 - important because that could be the
12:25 - difference between you know catching the
12:26 - person or or not catching them um or
12:29 - that could be the difference between
12:30 - saving someone's life and not saving
12:31 - someone's life so every little second
12:32 - matters uh so
12:35 - measuring the amount of force required
12:36 - is really important to our users because
12:38 - they want to make sure that they're not
12:39 - you know accidentally um triggering
12:42 - things on the radio that they don't want
12:43 - to happen so the radio on the left is
12:46 - without something called a
12:47 - a torque adder so it basically without
12:50 - having it the torque is the the force
12:52 - required is really low so you'll have
12:54 - more accidental you know knob movement
12:57 - the one on the right the torque is a lot
12:59 - higher because we added a little piece
13:01 - of or basically a rubber um inside of
13:03 - our knob which makes the user experience
13:05 - much better and makes it less likely for
13:07 - accidents like that to happen so writing
13:09 - code to be able to analyze that and you
13:12 - know
13:12 - once we collect all that data um it's
13:15 - really really helpful because it allows
13:17 - us to do what's made those decisions on
13:18 - the fly you know much faster and get to
13:20 - like the best design possible
13:24 - awesome well thank you so much for
13:26 - sharing that and for having these
13:27 - awesome graphics it's really cool to be
13:29 - able to see you know we saw the stuff
13:31 - that you do with you know testing the
13:33 - actual radios and now getting getting to
13:36 - see what you do with the code is very
13:37 - very cool so thank you for sharing that
13:40 - the problem
13:41 - outside of work
13:43 - what do you enjoy doing what's with
13:45 - something interesting about you good
13:48 - question okay so outside of work so i
13:50 - think as mentioned in my bio um i'm a
13:51 - huge basketball fanatic i mind you i
13:54 - love all sports um so i've taken i've
13:56 - taken up some more sports like uh i've
13:58 - recently taken off golf taking up tennis
14:00 - i've always loved uh football and
14:02 - volleyball but basketball is definitely
14:04 - like
14:04 - that's that's like the sport that i love
14:06 - so i'm a huge huge fan so uh recently on
14:10 - uh you know march 5th which is 305 day
14:12 - because i am from miami originally went
14:14 - to a heat game so you can see a little a
14:15 - little snippet of that and bernie you
14:17 - know having a great time so it was
14:19 - really really fun
14:20 - uh we want to win that game so if you're
14:22 - not a heat fan i'm sorry but if you
14:24 - aren't great uh that was that was good
14:26 - you know number one in the east so i'm
14:27 - super happy about that um and then i
14:29 - also love playing basketball on the
14:30 - weekends as well especially too i'm
14:32 - actually trying to get out there more
14:33 - often the way i used to back when i was
14:34 - in high school in college um but i've
14:36 - been playing ever since i was probably
14:38 - about
14:39 - about five years old um so it's
14:41 - definitely been a sport that i've loved
14:42 - for a long time um and then next to
14:45 - basketball i also really love music so
14:47 - to this day i still try to you know get
14:49 - active in garageband and just kind of
14:51 - tinker around you know make different
14:53 - songs make beats um different type of
14:55 - just some types of music
14:57 - and i started off in music back in
15:00 - i want to say um
15:01 - fifth fifth grade um was when i first
15:04 - picked up um my first instrument which
15:06 - was trombone and i played that in the
15:08 - band uh all the way up through high
15:09 - school so i have a little clip here on
15:11 - the right
15:12 - um let me know if you can hear if not
15:14 - i'll make sure that
15:16 - yep i'll make sure i make that
15:18 - adjustment
15:24 - [Music]
15:37 - marching band and basketball were like
15:38 - some of my favorite memories of
15:40 - definitely like from high school so this
15:42 - is still a big part of who i am in terms
15:43 - of like loving basketball living music
15:47 - very cool very cool um it looks like we
15:50 - have a question uh from the audience
15:54 - uh so it looks like miss lyons wants to
15:58 - know how long have you played basketball
16:01 - oh good question so yes i played
16:02 - basketball so i'm i just turned 25 not
16:05 - too long ago so
16:07 - wow
16:08 - i guess that's about 20 years
16:11 - that's crazy i really had thought about
16:13 - that
16:14 - wow that is that is quite a while
16:20 - very cool and it's i think it's so cool
16:22 - to
16:23 - to know that you know we can we computer
16:25 - scientist identifies our computer
16:27 - clients as well can be
16:28 - so well-rounded you know we can we can
16:30 - be technologists we can do the computer
16:32 - stuff we can do the engineering stuff
16:34 - and we can be super athletic awesome at
16:36 - sports we can be super musicians that's
16:39 - it's so great to see that
16:41 - absolutely
16:44 - we're getting oh we're getting some more
16:46 - questions in the chat
16:48 - so uh ms garda asks what program oh my
16:53 - goodness things things are happening
16:54 - what program language do you use
16:56 - programming language do you use in your
16:58 - job
16:59 - good question okay so
17:02 - let's see um so
17:04 - there's two that i've used uh like more
17:06 - often right so um one of the things that
17:09 - i did um last year was i joined what's
17:12 - called an alpha team um where we
17:14 - basically
17:15 - come up with like new ideas and uh
17:17 - basically build many versions of them
17:19 - and then if they're successful then they
17:20 - want to get incorporated into like what
17:22 - we do
17:23 - so part of that project was learning a
17:25 - new program language called rust so it's
17:28 - very similar to c
17:30 - and it's it's uh but it's a lot more
17:32 - secure in a lot of ways without getting
17:33 - too technical it's kind of like a
17:35 - slightly
17:36 - uh improved version of like c or c plus
17:39 - so i use a lot of that last year um but
17:41 - prior to that i definitely think that c
17:44 - plus plus or some version of c plus was
17:47 - probably the most popular because
17:48 - if i was you know in the example that i
17:50 - used earlier in the video um to write
17:53 - that code i did it in something called
17:55 - matlab um matlab is basically a
17:58 - program that is built basically on c um
18:02 - and then the actual um device that
18:05 - automatically turns the radio knobs um
18:07 - an intern actually take that project off
18:09 - and then i modified it but he used
18:11 - something called an arduino and arduinos
18:13 - also use um
18:15 - basically c
18:16 - or two plus plus as kind of like their
18:18 - native programming language so a lot of
18:19 - what i use mostly is c or c plus plus
18:24 - very cool very cool i would love to know
18:27 - uh
18:28 - for our teachers and students in the
18:30 - audience if you're using any of those
18:31 - languages in your classrooms or if you
18:34 - are familiar with them
18:35 - uh that would be really interesting to
18:37 - know you know you shared a lot of
18:39 - languages that are used
18:41 - so that's that's awesome thank you for
18:42 - sharing
18:45 - um we have a couple more questions
18:49 - uh so
18:51 - ida is curious to know what's what's the
18:54 - salary range for
18:56 - for position your position or position
18:58 - similar to yours
19:00 - good question so
19:01 - uh i will say that it probably varies by
19:05 - like location in the country so
19:07 - for like when i started the salary range
19:09 - for me was between like upper 60 000 to
19:12 - like
19:13 - uh upper 70 000 so that's kind of like
19:15 - the range where you start
19:17 - though i will admit that there are
19:18 - definitely a lot of opportunities to get
19:19 - raises and bonuses um especially at a
19:22 - company like motorola um and as the
19:25 - market gets more competitive i think
19:27 - some of those numbers are also like on
19:28 - the rise as well too which is fun when
19:30 - you're an engineer
19:32 - so that's great um and then i i i as i
19:35 - mentioned i'm based out of i still live
19:37 - in south florida to this day so as you
19:39 - move more like west a lot of times
19:41 - salaries will go up to kind of account
19:42 - for the cost of living
19:45 - that makes sense absolutely
19:47 - and besides getting to be in florida
19:49 - which is your home state uh emmanuel
19:52 - would like to know what's your the
19:54 - favorite part of your job
19:56 - good question so favorite part of my job
19:58 - oh it's
20:00 - man that's tricky hmm
20:02 - you know okay so i think one of the
20:05 - outside of like the technical like
20:08 - testing because that that's pretty fun
20:10 - um outside of creating stuff because i
20:12 - always love creating stuff one of the
20:13 - things that i found to be really really
20:15 - fun is just the opportunities to connect
20:17 - with other people i know like over the
20:19 - past you know two years you know we've
20:21 - all been separated in a lot of new ways
20:24 - because of the pandemic um so here at
20:27 - motorola so there's two groups that i'm
20:28 - a part of um one is called the young
20:30 - professionals group and the other one is
20:32 - called embito which is the motorola
20:34 - black inclusion diversity organization
20:36 - and i'm actually the president of that
20:37 - group for the company globally and
20:40 - both of those groups have amongst our
20:42 - other business councils within our
20:43 - company i spearheaded a lot a lot of
20:46 - initiatives to bring people together so
20:49 - we've had some opportunities to you know
20:51 - play games virtually together online um
20:54 - have opportunities to have speed
20:56 - networking sessions um
20:58 - and just get a chance just to just
20:59 - connect with people because a lot of
21:01 - times when you're you know cooked up in
21:02 - your house all you know for a long time
21:04 - and you kind of long for having you know
21:06 - that connection with just other people
21:08 - um i
21:09 - during most of the pandemic there were
21:11 - there were a few times as a mechanical
21:12 - engineer where i had going to the office
21:13 - still because i i mean i can't bring you
21:15 - know millions of dollars of equipment
21:17 - back home to my house with me also it's
21:18 - pretty heavy
21:20 - but um for the mo a lot for a good
21:22 - portion of it i was able to work
21:23 - remotely um and now in my current role
21:26 - i'm pretty much fully remote but i go
21:27 - back into office when i when i help out
21:29 - with hosting um in-person events so a
21:32 - lot of those in-person events again
21:34 - chance to connect with other people is
21:35 - really what um
21:37 - it's it's super fun because you meet
21:39 - people from all different walks of life
21:40 - um you've got a chance to learn from
21:42 - other people and their career paths um
21:44 - and how they can intersect with yours
21:46 - and it makes it a lot easier to learn
21:47 - more about what you're interested in and
21:49 - what opportunities are you know around
21:50 - in the company because there's not you
21:53 - know a lot of times you get when you get
21:54 - your first job there's not like a whole
21:56 - board that lays out all the options so
21:58 - the more people you know the more like
22:00 - holistic picture you have of like the
22:02 - opportunities you have for your career
22:03 - so it's been a lot of fun to meet a lot
22:05 - of people
22:07 - awesome and i think you hit you had a
22:09 - bunch of questions that we had uh one of
22:12 - the questions was do you do you work
22:13 - from home and it sounds like you do you
22:14 - do a little bit of work right you have
22:15 - to go into the office to do the testing
22:18 - but there's there's some work that you
22:19 - can do from home
22:20 - and relatedly sherry turner asks if
22:23 - do you get to travel with your job yes
22:26 - so oh cool story uh so actually
22:29 - next week i'm getting a chance to travel
22:31 - um so i'm i've been a member of the
22:33 - national study of black engineers since
22:34 - i was in college and now as a
22:36 - professional i get a chance to go there
22:38 - and help recruit um so i'll be going to
22:40 - california for the first time in a while
22:42 - i've been there before but it's been a
22:43 - couple of years um and then after that i
22:46 - will hopefully be able to go to indiana
22:47 - um to get to meet with some actual
22:50 - customers to talk with them and get
22:51 - their perspective on some of the cloud
22:53 - technology that we're that we're working
22:54 - on so yep definitely some opportunities
22:56 - to travel for sure
22:59 - that sounds awesome
23:02 - we have uh another question well we have
23:05 - a lot of questions i unfortunately don't
23:07 - think we're gonna be able to get to all
23:09 - of it because i've looked at the time
23:10 - we only have six minutes left
23:12 - uh but from marine garda how do you
23:16 - protect the police networks from cyber
23:19 - attacks
23:21 - perhaps you know it looks like it sounds
23:23 - like you do a lot more of the hardware
23:25 - so does that perhaps have to do
23:27 - do you have do you have to put some
23:29 - extra security with the work that you're
23:31 - doing in the cloud or do you
23:33 - maybe do that with some third parties
23:36 - that's a great question so it's funny
23:37 - because i've been learning a lot more
23:39 - about that in my new role especially
23:40 - because we're working a lot more with
23:41 - cloud now i will say that even aside
23:44 - from cloud um like
23:46 - cyber security is like a whole part of
23:48 - motorola i mean it's a whole career path
23:49 - within motorola in and of itself and
23:52 - i've made some friends in that in that
23:53 - group and learned a little bit more
23:54 - about that so even without the cloud
23:56 - technology cyber security is so
23:58 - important because i mean it's kind of
24:00 - like the wave of the future in terms of
24:01 - like analyzing threats and trying to
24:03 - prevent them from happening um i mean i
24:05 - know like over the past couple of years
24:06 - a lot of cities have been attacked and
24:08 - had like a lot of their data data
24:09 - centers held hostage and it's costed you
24:11 - know millions of dollars or you know
24:13 - there's been information leaked so it's
24:15 - super important um so that's something
24:16 - that we get we definitely hold in high
24:18 - regard and in my new current role with
24:20 - uh you know we're focusing on on cloud
24:23 - technology it's also super important um
24:25 - one of the benefits of cloud technology
24:26 - is that we can roll out you know
24:28 - security patches and updates in real
24:30 - time like across the country across the
24:32 - globe to be honest um so it makes it
24:35 - much more difficult for you know a cyber
24:37 - attacker to keep up with us when we can
24:39 - move that you know that ad in that agile
24:42 - fashion um so that's one of the perks of
24:44 - like switching to a more cloud-based
24:45 - platform
24:48 - very cool awesome thank you so much
24:51 - we're running a little tight on time
24:54 - so just in case you run out of time
24:57 - i
24:57 - what are some what's an obstacle you
25:00 - faced um and relatedly what pieces of
25:03 - advice would you give to all of the
25:05 - students tuning in
25:06 - definitely okay so
25:08 - one obstacle that i face that um comes
25:10 - to mind um and uh as like i mentioned
25:13 - when i first
25:14 - my major was mechanical was mechanical
25:16 - engineering um when i first started at
25:18 - florida atlantic university it's my alma
25:20 - mater um
25:21 - that was my only major and i was
25:23 - originally gonna double major in
25:24 - business um and i wanted to actually
25:25 - changing that to a minor so i could also
25:27 - minor in computer science but the first
25:29 - time um
25:31 - in one of my classes right i never
25:33 - failed a class before um and i was i i
25:35 - entered fau as a junior because i got my
25:37 - a in high school
25:39 - and i was taking junior level classes as
25:42 - a freshman there was one class that was
25:43 - really hard um and there was a project
25:45 - that was like that could have really
25:47 - helped my grade um but it required that
25:51 - you know you had a code and i had really
25:53 - never quoted before as as a freshman in
25:55 - college i would like i just hadn't
25:57 - really had experience with that um and i
25:59 - didn't pass the class
26:00 - and that was really really hard for me
26:02 - um because i that was that was new um i
26:05 - took the class again the following year
26:07 - and the the only difference is that a i
26:09 - mean yes i've seen the material before
26:11 - yeah but i still didn't understand it
26:13 - you know until
26:14 - i learned how to study a little bit
26:16 - better for that class but the the main
26:18 - thing that changed was that i learned
26:19 - how to code so i had added my cs minor i
26:22 - had taken my first c my first intro to c
26:24 - class and that made a world of
26:26 - difference if i got like a minus or b
26:27 - plus in the class second time around
26:28 - just because
26:30 - it's a lot a lot of engineering is
26:31 - learning how to learn so as kind of
26:34 - transitioning into like advice the
26:35 - earlier you start um you know
26:38 - learning the principles of being
26:41 - creative thinking outside the box and
26:43 - how to code right because that's really
26:45 - important even if you're not a computer
26:47 - science major it's still super helpful
26:49 - to have those principles down early
26:51 - early on because when you get to college
26:53 - it helps you break down problems into
26:55 - bite-sized pieces um and literally once
26:58 - you learn one code it's easier to learn
27:00 - other ones so i mean whether you learn
27:01 - python or c or java it's just important
27:04 - just to get started and there's no time
27:06 - better than the president to do that
27:09 - absolutely yes i completely agree once
27:12 - once you learn one language once you
27:13 - learn the fundamentals you can really
27:15 - pick up other languages so much more
27:17 - easily this
27:19 - crucial point there
27:20 - relatedly to you were talking about your
27:23 - experience in college um and so from
27:25 - zina pounds he wants has a question if
27:28 - wants to know have you completed any
27:29 - internships and if so which
27:31 - oh good question yeah so i've actually
27:34 - tried to talk about that earlier um so
27:37 - coming into college um obviously i had
27:39 - no like internship experience with
27:41 - engineering um when i by time i
27:42 - graduated i actually had five
27:44 - internships internships are like super
27:47 - super helpful um for a number of reasons
27:49 - that we don't have time to get into for
27:50 - today but as far as the place i interned
27:52 - with i interned with a
27:55 - a utility company called fpl nexter
27:57 - energy i interned with a small
28:00 - biomedical company called full spine
28:01 - where i actually got to design something
28:03 - that was using a spinal surgery which is
28:04 - really cool
28:05 - um a little bit about medical mechanical
28:07 - engineers there i actually tend to
28:09 - intern with a manufacturing company
28:11 - called decimal engineering so i can see
28:13 - how stuff was made i'm behind the scenes
28:15 - i got a chance to work with an aerospace
28:17 - company called north of grumman in
28:18 - california that was fun it was the first
28:20 - time i ever lived away from home for
28:22 - more than like a month so that was cool
28:24 - and it was a brand new industry to me
28:27 - and then i also have a chance to work at
28:29 - a company called belkin which is also an
28:31 - aerospace company as well too
28:32 - um so
28:34 - that was all i think that's covers all
28:35 - five but yeah um i got like a wealth of
28:38 - experience wealth of knowledge um it
28:40 - made a lot of connections uh just from
28:42 - having those internships and i got them
28:44 - through uh networking events such as you
28:46 - know with national idea black engineer
28:48 - the society of hispanic professional
28:50 - engineers um the american association of
28:52 - blacks energy so applying for
28:53 - scholarships and and joining those
28:55 - professional you know memberships to
28:57 - college definitely another piece of
28:58 - advice that i would give because it
28:59 - definitely goes a long way to help
29:01 - expand the options um for your career
29:04 - absolutely i
29:05 - fully fully second that as someone who
29:08 - went what they would afford college to
29:09 - scholarships absolutely scholarships are
29:12 - so so important yes save here
29:16 - well richard thank you so much for
29:17 - answering all of our questions thank you
29:19 - to all the teachers and students tuning
29:21 - in and for all the awesome questions
29:23 - that you posed very sorry we couldn't
29:24 - get to all of them so excited that we
29:26 - have you tuning in i as a reminder we
29:29 - have a bunch more of these chats coming
