00:00 - Hour of Code Minecraft | Spawn
00:04 - In games, spawn
means the same thing as create.
00:08 - In this level, let's make zombies spawn when
the sun goes down.
00:14 - To do this, we'll use the "when night" block.
00:17 - Since we want the zombies to spawn at night
we'll add the "spawn zombie" block under the
00:22 - "when night" block.
00:26 - As soon as they're spawned, each zombie will
run the code that you put in their "when spawned"
00:31 - event slot.
00:32 - Have fun spawning zombies!
