00:00 - music lab it's really cool you can like
00:02 - make your own music with it I just
00:04 - really love code and music it's like
00:07 - you're almost quoting without even
00:08 - knowing it's helped me engage just
00:10 - another whole set as student this is
00:15 - cool I don't think there's ever been a
00:17 - better time to be a Creator whether
00:18 - that's in any field of computer science
00:20 - or music like I do there are an abundant
00:23 - amount of tools that can allow you to
00:25 - create things that just didn't exist
00:26 - before there are tons of plugins that I
00:29 - can just on my laptop and create the
00:32 - type of music that I really am drawn to
00:35 - I can make almost anything that I can
00:37 - imagine and with the help of a computer
00:40 - bring it to the world I wouldn't be able
00:42 - to create music without technology I
00:45 - started making everything in the Box
00:47 - meaning on my laptop a lot of our
00:49 - biggest songs are just made there we've
00:51 - been able to manipulate the stuff in the
00:53 - Box to sound like something that's
00:55 - acoustic or organic or actual piece of
00:58 - Hardware I feel like music is a way to
01:01 - express things that you just can't with
01:04 - words or physical actions the first song
01:06 - I wrote was about my friend who was
01:08 - leaving town and I was so sad for some
01:11 - reason wrote a song and uh I discovered
01:15 - that it just helps me cope with stuff I
01:17 - think it's important to have access to
01:19 - the tools that can allow you to express
01:20 - yourself code.org and music lab is one
01:24 - of those tools where if you're feeling
01:26 - something and you just want to get it
01:28 - out you can use a pencil and paper but
01:30 - you can also create something that's
01:31 - much more robust and share it in a way
01:34 - that you wouldn't have been able to
01:36 - before I was like a student who got an
01:39 - opportunity to get a laptop to get my
01:42 - music production softwares and start
01:44 - making music it was basically the start
01:46 - of my career I started making demos I'd
01:49 - encourage everyone to experience with
01:51 - some form of computer science whether
01:52 - it's music or anything else to create
01:55 - things that are important to you that
01:56 - don't exist
01:58 - [Music]
