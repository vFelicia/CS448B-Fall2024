00:06 - my name is pauline guskova i'm a data
00:07 - scientist at electronic arts and my job
00:11 - is to build the machine learning
00:13 - components for the player and developer
00:15 - experience team
00:17 - if i was to give some advice it would be
00:18 - just to follow your passion
00:20 - just to explore your interests if you
00:23 - love gaming then great
00:25 - figure out how the games are built and i
00:27 - think that's how a lot of people
00:29 - actually started out at ea
00:33 - they wanted to learn how the games were
00:35 - built they wanted to build their own
00:36 - games
00:37 - and they went out and did that
00:40 - for me i was really interested in
00:42 - machine learning and the idea of doing
00:44 - that in the context of video games just
00:47 - sounded really awesome and
00:49 - right now i love it because there's so
00:52 - much opportunity still left
00:55 - when i was younger i remember my dad was
00:58 - a grad student
00:59 - and i would spend hours at a robotics
01:01 - lab so i saw all the newest tech as soon
01:04 - as it came out i remember dial-up
01:07 - connections i remember every version of
01:09 - the mp3 player
01:11 - and since my dad was an early adopter
01:13 - and i was surrounded by this i kind of
01:16 - grew up with the expectation that i
01:19 - would be coding and i kind of viewed
01:22 - coding as a necessary skill
01:24 - and so i went to engineering school i
01:26 - studied science i studied math i took
01:28 - all of the necessary classes but what
01:30 - got me really excited was machine
01:33 - learning
01:34 - and all of the really cool applications
01:38 - and how you can teach computers to do
01:41 - things that only humans were previously
01:43 - able to do
01:44 - and so at electronic arts you can think
01:47 - about how
01:48 - instead of just getting a game
01:50 - that's the same game as everyone else
01:52 - you can get a game that's personalized
01:54 - to you where the content is unique to
01:56 - what you're interested in and then the
01:58 - difficulty is adjusted to what's fun for
02:00 - you and that's what the world's moving
02:02 - towards
02:04 - i remember when i was taking programming
02:06 - in high school it was a really small
02:08 - class and they're really only two girls
02:10 - in the whole class
02:12 - and it just had these nerdy connotations
02:14 - and now many years later
02:17 - it's become so much more popular there's
02:19 - so many people and so many resources to
02:22 - help you get into it and so many
02:25 - applications so even if you're not
02:27 - interested in just being a programmer
02:30 - even if you're interested in biology or
02:31 - if you're interested in political
02:33 - science there's so many applications for
02:35 - it and it's such an important skill that
02:38 - i would highly recommend that everyone
02:39 - try it out
