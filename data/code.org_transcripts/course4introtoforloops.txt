00:05 - When you use a repeat block to loop your code
how does the computer know when it's repeated
00:10 - enough times? The repeat block is actually
hiding a more sophisticated piece of code
00:15 - called a for loop which counts from a starting
value up to an ending value by a specific
00:21 - increment. For example, a repeat 3 block counts
from 1 to 3 by 1. Every time it counts, it
00:30 - runs the code inside the loop. The for loop
knows how many times it has run by using a
00:35 - counter variable that is set to the starting
value at the beginning of the loop and has
00:40 - the increment added to it each time the loop
is run. As soon as the counter variable is
00:44 - greater than the ending value the loop stops
running. The benefit of using a real for loop
00:51 - instead of the repeat block is that you can
actually see the counter variable and use
00:55 - it in your loop.
