00:00 - One thing that computers are really good
at is repeating commands.
00:03 - As a person, you'd get really bored if you
had to do the same thing lots of times in a row.
00:08 - But a computer can do the same thing
millions or even billions of times,
00:12 - and not get bored and be able to carry
that out really well.
00:15 - So for example if I wanted to wish
00:17 - everyone on Facebook a happy birthday by
sending them an email,
00:20 - it might take me more than a century to
actually write out all of those emails to everyone.
00:25 - But with just a few lines of code, I can have
a system
00:28 - send an email to everyone on Facebook
wishing them a happy birthday.
00:32 - So that's what loops are, and why they're
valuable,
00:34 - and something that computers can do very well.
00:37 - In this example your goal is going to be
to move the bird
00:40 - to get the pig. Now we're gonna be able to use the "repeat" block
00:44 - in order to be able to do this very
easily. You can either do this by
00:49 - giving the computer a "move forward"
command
00:52 - five times in order to advance the bird
one step each time to the pig.
00:57 - Or you can just tell the computer to
"move forward" once,
01:00 - and then tell it to "repeat" that 5
times, and it will do the same thing.
01:04 - So in order to do this you drag your
"move forward" command,
01:08 - and then you put it inside the
"repeat" block.
01:11 - And you can click on it and tell it how
many times you want to repeat the block
01:16 - to tell it how many steps you want it to
take forward. Now one more thing is
01:19 - you can put as many commands as you
want inside the "repeat" block.
01:23 - So in this example you're telling it to
move forward and turn left,
01:26 - which it will do five times. Alright good
job and have fun :-)
