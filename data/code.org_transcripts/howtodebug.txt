00:00 - Programming's a game.
00:02 - It's something that you and the computer are working towards together.
00:05 - But you're gonna fail a lot.
00:07 - Just get comfortable with failing because it happens.
00:10 - When you program, you have to get it wrong
00:13 - because that's how you learn.
00:14 - When you do make mistakes you're like
00:16 - "Okay it's fine. I can fix this."
00:18 - Everyone gets bugs.
00:19 - Whether you're a beginner, intermediate,
advanced...
00:23 - everyone gets bugs.
00:24 - When a computer is not working the way it's supposed to,
00:26 - the way we want it to,
00:27 - we call that a bug.
00:28 - I get bugs.
00:32 - I totally get bugs.
00:34 - Everyone gets bugs!
00:36 - Debugging is basically just looking
through your code
00:39 - and correcting your mistakes and fixing it.
00:42 - There are four really important steps
00:44 - that you want to follow when you're debugging.
00:45 - The first thing you want to do is describe your problem.
00:48 - So figure out what's happening.
00:50 - What did you want your code to do and what is it actually doing?
00:52 - Second step is you want to hunt for bugs.
00:54 - So figure out what is it in your code that's causing that.
00:57 - Step number three is you want to try out small solutions
01:01 - and see how they affect your code.
01:03 - And then finally step four is you want to document what you've learned.
01:08 - Debugging is maybe the number one thing
01:10 - that can help you become a better programmer
01:12 - because you're seeing the mistakes you made.
01:15 - Wait, don't delete that.
01:17 - Can you help me with this for a second?
01:18 - Can you help me with this for a second?
01:21 - Most of the time I spend debugging is finding the bug
01:24 - but once I find it it's easy to fix.
01:26 - What's this?
01:28 - Get out of here bugs.
01:29 - Did your parents put that there?
01:31 - Maybe, I don't know.
01:32 - I like debugging with other people
01:34 - because they are like a second brain
01:36 - which doubles your computing power
01:38 - so you can figure out bugs twice as fast.
01:41 - Dude we did it
01:43 - Experts make bugs.
01:45 - They make big bugs!
01:46 - In fact your goal should be, as you go along
01:49 - make bigger and bigger bugs that need to
be squashed
01:52 - because that just means you're doing something worth doing.
01:54 - Y'know, the more you practice, the better you get at it,
01:57 - the easier it will be.
01:59 - I can debug!
02:03 - I can debug
02:04 - and so can you!
