00:07 - Hi! I'm Dion. I'm one of the creators 
of Forethought AI. At Forethought,  
00:12 - we build artificially intelligent tools that 
people can use at work to be more productive.
00:19 - To make a learning machine, early computer 
scientists looked for clues by studying  
00:24 - other things that are good at learning, 
and it turns out that nothing is better  
00:28 - at learning than the human brain! Our brains 
are made up of special cells called neurons.  
00:34 - A neuron has two ends: input 
signals enter in on one end,  
00:37 - they're combined together inside the neuron, 
and leave out the other end as a single output.
00:44 - All of the billions of neurons in your brain 
are connected to each other, in what's called  
00:50 - a biological neural network. It's how your brain 
processes information and recognizes patterns.  
00:58 - Early AI scientists decided to mimic human neurons 
by making their own simple artificial neurons in  
01:04 - software. Nothing fancy, just multiple signals 
going in as inputs, passing through the neuron,  
01:11 - and getting combined and processed by some 
simple math into a new signal going out.
01:17 - It's a good start, but one 
neuron alone doesn't do much.  
01:22 - The full potential of this idea is only 
unleashed when the artificial neurons  
01:26 - are connected together to make an artificial 
neural network. This is what allows computers to  
01:32 - recognize images, drive cars, 
and make some truly weird art.  
01:40 - To see how a neuron works, let's build a movie 
recommendation system, that uses critics reviews  
01:45 - to guess how much you'll like a movie. Then, 
we'll use your feedback to make the system better!
01:51 - Here are three movie critics: Ali, Bowie, 
and Casey. Each one rates a movie anywhere  
01:57 - from one to five stars. Now, let's 
build a single artificial neuron.
02:02 - Each of the critics ratings enters on this side 
as input, some calculations are done in here,  
02:08 - and we get a single output. In 
this case, it's a movie rating.  
02:13 - Here's the first movie. Ali gives it one star, 
Bowie gives it five, and Casey gives it a four  
02:19 - star review. At first, the critics opinions all 
carry the same weight, and are counted equally.  
02:26 - The inputs enter, there's some basic 
math, and out comes a recommendation.  
02:33 - Now, let's watch the movie so 
we can give it our own rating!
02:44 - Uh, okay. That was weird! Let's let's pretend you 
really liked it, and gave it a five star rating.  
02:53 - The rating you just provided is now used to 
train the neuron. Based on your rating, the  
02:59 - weight of each critic's opinion is recalculated. 
Your rating is closer to that of Bowie and Casey,  
03:07 - so their opinions get more weight. You 
didn't agree with Ali's single star review,  
03:13 - so that weight goes down. Now 
let's train the neuron again.
03:19 - Here's another movie, and here are new 
ratings from our critics. And this time,  
03:24 - the neuron will give more weight to these two 
ratings when calculating its recommendation.
03:31 - And here's the output! Now let's give it a watch.
03:41 - Well, at least that was 
short! Let's give it a rating.  
03:46 - Our new rating adjusts the weights again. 
This process repeats over and over, until  
03:51 - we've trained a system to know our preferences, 
and recommend movies that we'll probably enjoy.
03:59 - In this example, there's just one neuron. 
That's far more simplistic than most systems.  
04:04 - Powerful neural networks have millions 
of neurons arranged in layers.  
04:08 - There are input layers, any number 
of hidden layers, and output layers.
04:15 - The output of one layer of neurons, becomes 
the input to the next layer, and so on.  
04:23 - Many real world media music and shopping 
recommendation systems work like this,  
04:28 - using ratings for millions of everyday users  
04:31 - in those neural networks. Everyone 
has a hand in modifying the weights.
04:37 - Neural networks have so many other uses. 
They're working behind the scenes on big  
04:43 - problems, like growing healthier food, 
predicting floods and forest fires,  
04:48 - aiding wildlife conservation, and 
even detecting and curing disease.
