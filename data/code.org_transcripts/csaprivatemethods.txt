00:10 - when a chef makes spaghetti with
00:11 - meatballs they have several tasks they
00:14 - have to complete but when i go to a
00:17 - restaurant and order spaghetti i just
00:19 - ask for spaghetti with meatballs i don't
00:21 - need to know what goes into making it
00:24 - in java we have used public methods that
00:26 - we call to complete tasks
00:28 - in the body of the method we write the
00:31 - code that should run when the method is
00:32 - called
00:34 - a user doesn't have to know how it works
00:36 - in order to use the method
00:38 - sometimes even a public method needs to
00:40 - complete multiple tasks to achieve its
00:43 - goal
00:44 - a private method is a method that is
00:46 - accessible only from within the class
00:49 - we can use private methods to simplify
00:52 - complex tasks
00:54 - spaghetti may not be complicated to make
00:56 - but it does have multiple tasks
00:59 - in our restaurant class
01:01 - we have a method called make spaghetti
01:03 - in this method we could write all the
01:05 - steps it takes to make spaghetti
01:08 - or we could use private methods to
01:10 - represent the specific tasks that make
01:12 - up the process of making spaghetti
01:15 - a helper method is a method that
01:17 - performs a component of another method
01:20 - we could write private methods for make
01:23 - noodles
01:24 - make meatballs
01:26 - make sauce
01:28 - these are examples of helper methods
01:31 - in our make spaghetti method
01:33 - we can then call these private methods
01:35 - to make the meal
01:37 - first we make the noodles then make the
01:40 - meatballs
01:41 - and finally make the sauce
01:44 - why make these methods private
01:47 - a customer should only be able to ask
01:49 - for spaghetti they can't ask for just
01:51 - noodles or just meatballs or just sauce
01:54 - these methods are private so they are
01:56 - only accessible from within the
01:58 - restaurant class
02:01 - this also makes it much easier to read
02:03 - and maintain our restaurant code
02:05 - if the chef wanted to update the recipe
02:07 - for the sauce
02:08 - they can easily make the change
02:11 - private methods are helpful for
02:13 - organizing our code and breaking down
02:15 - complex tasks
