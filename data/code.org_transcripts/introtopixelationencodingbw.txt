00:01 - Closed Caption text: Intro to B&W Pixelation
00:03 -  
My name is Lydia Choi. I work for Oculus as a  
00:08 - technical art director, and I’m currently 
working on virtual reality hardware. 
 
00:13 - It’s kind of like a baseball cap. This 
motion, and then you flip down the uh,  
00:21 - that’s it. [Music] 
The  
00:24 - current thing that we’re building 
is a virtual reality sculpting tool,  
00:30 - trying to simulate like clay sculpting in space. 
 
00:38 - Welcome to the pixelation widget, where you 
will encode a black and white image by typing  
00:42 - out the binary yourself. Don’t worry, it’s 
easier and more fun than you might think. 
 
00:48 - In this widget the first 
two bytes, 16 bits of data,  
00:52 - are used to define the width and height of the 
image you want to encode. The first eight bits  
00:58 - define the width and the second eight bits the 
height. You have to type out all the bits but the  
01:04 - widget shows you the decimal translation so you 
can make sure you’re typing the numbers you want.  
01:10 - To make it easier to keep track of where you’re 
typing you can add spaces and line breaks to the  
01:14 - binary code. The widget doesn’t pay attention to 
them, it just interprets the bits that are there.  
01:22 - Now it’s easier for me to see which bits I need 
to change to set the width and height I want.  
01:28 - I’m going to make a very small image 
that’s just 4 pixels by 4 pixels.  
01:33 - Now the fun part! After we’ve set the width and 
height of the image, the next bits we type are  
01:38 - the bits that define how the pixels are colored. 
We’re just working in black and white for now,  
01:43 - so keep it simple, one bit per pixel. In 
digital images we define color in terms of light  
01:50 - and we can turn the lights behind each pixel on or 
off. So we let a one, I mean, turn the light on,  
01:56 - which gives us white. A zero means turn 
the light off, which gives us black. 
 
02:02 - Did you notice that I added line breaks when I was 
typing so that I could keep track of the row I was  
02:08 - working on? That’s a handy trick and we actually 
have buttons that will help you with that. 
 
02:14 - If you click the raw format button it will strip 
out all the spaces and line breaks so you can see  
02:20 - what the raw binary code looks 
like. The readable format button  
02:24 - will reinsert spaces and line breaks to make it 
easier to read and edit. If you screw up your  
02:30 - spacing or get lost in the bits you can always 
hit format and it will clean things up for you. 
 
02:36 - Let’s look at an example of a bigger black 
and white image. If you click actual size,  
02:42 - it will show you what your image looks like 
when using the real pixels on your computer.  
02:48 - For images here it’s probably going to 
be pretty small. Lastly you can save the  
02:53 - wonderful image you've made by clicking save PNG. 
This will take the current state of your canvas,  
02:59 - whether you’re zoomed in or showing actual 
size, and pop into a new window. You can drag  
03:06 - the image from there to your computer 
or save it in some other way. [Music]
