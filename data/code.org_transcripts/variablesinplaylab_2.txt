00:04 - A variable is a container that you can store
a value in.
00:08 - When you use that variable in an algorithm,
it opens up the container and looks at the
00:13 - value inside.
00:14 - This lets you write smarter algorithms that
behave differently depending on the value
00:19 - stored in the variable.
00:20 - Now you're going to try playlab where you
are given different games and you can change
00:25 - the values of variables like speed, height,
score, in order to change the game.
00:31 - You won't have to change the algorithm of
the game to change how it plays, just the
00:35 - variable.
00:37 - In my work for Kindle and on X-ray for books,
we apply variables in many different ways.
00:41 - One way that you can use a variable is to
store page numbers of a book.
00:46 - A user can increase and decrease the size
of the font on a page.
00:50 - Based on the font size, the number of pages
in the book can change.
00:54 - We can adjust it by storing the number of
pages in the variable.
