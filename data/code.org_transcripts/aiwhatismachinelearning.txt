00:08 - My name is Ale Flores, and I'm product
manager at Alexa.
00:12 - My name is Dr. Chelsea Haupt. I work at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence,
00:15 - and I work on an AI-powered academic search engine.
00:21 - All around you, computers are making
decisions, and those decisions affect
00:26 - your daily life. When you do an internet
search or scroll through your newsfeed,
00:31 - computers decide what you see.
00:34 - Computers can already recognize your face and understand your voice,
00:39 - soon they'll be driving cars and detecting diseases, even better than humans.
00:44 - So how is any of this possible?
00:47 - You may have heard of something called AI or artificial intelligence.
00:53 - True artificial intelligence is decades away.
00:57 - But a type of AI is here today, called Machine Learning.
01:01 - It's a type of AI you probably interact with every day, without knowing it.
01:05 - It has the opportunity to help us tackle some of the world's biggest challenges.
01:12 - Machine learning is how computers recognize patterns, and make decisions
01:18 - without being explicitly programmed.
01:21 - What's so exciting, is that it's a completely
different way to program a computer than
01:27 - what we've ever done before.
01:31 - With machine learning, instead of programming a computer step by step,
01:37 - you can program to learn just like you learn, through trial and error, and lots of practice.
01:44 - Learning comes from experience, and that's true for machine learning too.
01:49 - In this case, "experience" means lots and lots of data.
01:54 - Machine learning can take in any kind of data:
01:57 - Images, video, audio, or text, and begin to
recognize patterns in that data.
02:06 - Once it learns to recognize patterns in the data, it can also learn to make predictions
02:11 - based on those patterns.
02:13 - Like noticing the difference between an image of a car, and an image of a bicycle.
02:20 - AI and machine learning are playing a bigger and bigger role in society at large,
02:26 - and shaping all of our futures.
02:29 - That's why it's so important to learn how it works, with some hands-on experience.
02:35 - You're about to get the chance to train your own machine learning model.
02:40 - Remember, AI is like any tool: first you get the knowledge, then you get the power!
