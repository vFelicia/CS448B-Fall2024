00:01 - all right thank you everyone for joining
00:03 - us today on this exciting hour of code
00:06 - video chat with the founder and CEO of
00:09 - tumblr David Karp tumblr was founded in
00:13 - around 2007 it has over 200 million
00:16 - blogs and is one of the fastest growing
00:18 - social networks today so please join me
00:22 - in welcoming David this is so cool thank
00:47 - you for hanging out everyone really
00:50 - excited to chat today thank you and we
00:54 - will start with our first question it is
00:56 - from Wissahickon middle school in Imbler
01:00 - pennsylvania are what got you interested
01:17 - in coding and programming and was there
01:20 - and was there some event or project that
01:23 - sparked your interest for me it was
01:26 - really growing up on the Internet I
01:30 - think that's something that you guys you
01:32 - know I know is the norm something that
01:35 - everybody does but I was kind of one of
01:36 - those first kids who grew up with back
01:39 - then it was like called him line you
01:42 - dialed up to the Internet and it was new
01:47 - it was really novel and I loved it I was
01:49 - just so enamored and excited about all
01:53 - of the stuff that people were making
01:54 - there and all the ways that people were
01:56 - fighting to express themselves on the
01:59 - internet and I think in the same way
02:01 - that some people get really excited
02:03 - about you know the music that they make
02:05 - or that they listen to or the clothes
02:07 - that they wear I started to find the
02:10 - Internet as a space where I could really
02:11 - express myself where I
02:13 - put an identity out there to the world
02:14 - that I was really proud of and that's no
02:17 - these days it's social media is having a
02:20 - tumblr or Facebook and Twitter an
02:22 - Instagram where you can put yourself
02:24 - back then you had to build websites you
02:26 - had to know how to code if you wanted to
02:28 - make any of this stuff and I really
02:30 - wanted to make all of that stuff I
02:31 - really wanted to put something out there
02:33 - that was an expression of myself and so
02:36 - I started to pick up the tools explore
02:40 - the tools and eventually like learn the
02:41 - tools so I could I could make a website
02:44 - out there on the internet for myself and
02:46 - I've had a website since I was probably
02:49 - about your age gone through many many
02:52 - different ones that you know looked
02:54 - pretty bad in the beginning and started
02:56 - to get like a little bit better and a
02:57 - little bit better and my code started to
02:59 - get a little nicer a little bit nicer
03:01 - you know eventually started to make
03:02 - stuff on the internet that I was really
03:04 - really proud of but for me it was you
03:06 - know part of my expression in the same
03:07 - way that you know people wake up and get
03:11 - really excited about the outfit that
03:12 - they're gonna put together or go home
03:15 - and get really inspired to write a song
03:17 - for him for me it's always been that
03:18 - sort of expression awesome great our
03:23 - next question is from bumpass middle
03:25 - school in Hoover Alabama hi my name is
03:29 - Abhishek and my question was what your
03:36 - parents thought when you decided to drop
03:38 - out of high school and create a website
03:41 - they were very supportive surprisingly
03:45 - they were very supportive but you have
03:47 - to remember is that this was more than
03:49 - 10 years ago this is probably 14 or 15
03:51 - years ago that I dropped out of school
03:53 - now god I makes me feel old but this was
03:57 - this is more than a decade ago that I
03:58 - left high school to start working and
04:01 - the real reason was you know you
04:04 - couldn't back then get a really good
04:07 - computer science or programming
04:09 - education in school that's like all I
04:12 - wanted to be doing I just I knew that I
04:13 - wanted to be coding I knew that I wanted
04:15 - to be building websites and you know I
04:19 - was in school kind of learning about
04:20 - Excel I was learning about like
04:22 - Microsoft Word when I wanted to be
04:24 - learning about all of this new
04:26 - programming and internet technology and
04:28 - it just wasn't in school at the time so
04:30 - my the reason my parents were supportive
04:32 - was they knew that I knew what I wanted
04:35 - to be doing and they saw more
04:37 - opportunities for me to do that outside
04:39 - of school if I could have gotten it in
04:41 - school believe me I would have I would
04:44 - have been there and I would have been
04:45 - there all day and night getting as much
04:47 - of that as I could from the teachers but
04:49 - unfortunately just high schools in New
04:51 - York City fifteen years ago they're just
04:53 - there weren't teachers yet really knew
04:54 - how to program or could teach you the
04:56 - stuff you guys are incredibly lucky than
04:58 - access to more and more people who
04:59 - really they're great at this stuff
05:01 - and by the way more and more of the this
05:04 - next generation of programmers that I've
05:05 - had the pleasure and privilege to work
05:08 - with at tumbler that have been through
05:10 - that education or much better engineers
05:14 - than I am they're much better programmer
05:15 - so you really you can get so much out of
05:17 - that magic education and if you're if
05:20 - you're excited about software hardware
05:22 - or if you're excited about technology I
05:24 - think school is the most exciting
05:27 - interesting and instructive place that
05:29 - you could possibly be right now
05:31 - hey I want to go back at some point I
05:33 - want to make up for all of the time in
05:35 - school I didn't get you guys are very
05:37 - lucky well thanks for that really
05:42 - thorough answers I love just to mention
05:44 - a lot of these students are trying
05:45 - computer science for the first time in
05:48 - their schools this week so hopefully
05:51 - they'll keep going um and our next
05:53 - question is from Morgantown High School
05:56 - in Morgantown West Virginia hi I'm Nick
06:02 - from Morgantown West Virginia and our
06:04 - question is David when you started you
06:07 - were a pretty young entrepreneur in your
06:09 - field did you face any specific like
06:11 - obstacles or challenges because you
06:13 - started so young yeah I mean the biggest
06:17 - thing is just inexperienced going into
06:20 - building a company if you haven't done
06:21 - it before there's so much to learn and a
06:24 - lot of people do at least in my industry
06:27 - you know in this this tech world a lot
06:29 - of people do sort of learn as they go
06:30 - and that's really a function of its the
06:35 - people building these companies or
06:37 - people who have who are engineers by
06:38 - background
06:39 - this technology background and so you
06:41 - know most of those are young people who
06:44 - are the the people growing up with that
06:45 - technology who then go on to start
06:47 - companies you think about most people
06:48 - who go on to run companies build teams
06:51 - you know they start on a team and then
06:53 - they graduates becoming a manager and
06:55 - then they graduates running a bigger
06:57 - team and then maybe they end up on an
06:58 - executive team and running a whole
07:00 - company or eventually starting a company
07:01 - this is a pretty tough way to go about
07:04 - it where you really start from scratch
07:06 - with the whole thing it charged with
07:10 - with running not just a product or a
07:13 - codebase but a team and investors a
07:17 - company a community users all of that
07:20 - it's interesting it was a it is a whole
07:24 - lot to get comfortable with and good at
07:27 - and you're kind of thrown into it you're
07:29 - forced to get good at it and comfortable
07:30 - with it pretty quickly so you know
07:32 - that's where a lot of the I'm just
07:34 - comfort or me or missteps come from I
07:36 - was able to save myself from a lot of
07:38 - that by surrounding myself with really
07:40 - great mentors who had seen this stuff
07:43 - before even if they they weren't
07:44 - necessarily in the technology industry
07:46 - they'd they build companies before they
07:48 - looked at big companies before so they
07:50 - could help me understand what I needed
07:53 - to be doing or what our team needed to
07:55 - be doing or what would be coming next
07:57 - and you know that's that's frankly a lot
08:00 - of the some of the biggest challenges
08:04 - are just in being a I was a 21 year old
08:06 - CEO and we started this thing it was
08:08 - much smaller back then but still 21 I
08:11 - just I didn't know what was coming next
08:12 - it was very hard to see what was around
08:14 - the corner and so having people around
08:16 - me who knew what was up knew how the
08:20 - stuff played out they were there to kind
08:23 - of grab me on the back of the hoody
08:25 - every now and then and say hey hey David
08:27 - you need to watch out for this you need
08:29 - to think about this you should be
08:30 - working harder on that this or worrying
08:32 - less about this
08:33 - that was really extraordinarily helpful
08:36 - and beyond that I'd say I'm managing
08:39 - people particularly when you're managing
08:42 - or working with people that are older
08:44 - than you and you haven't even really
08:46 - been out there working for very long
08:48 - that was that was challenging and
08:50 - occasionally that was interesting in a
08:53 - case
08:53 - really really challenging so yeah the
08:55 - way I think I got through a lot of that
08:57 - and we've been able to build this team
08:58 - out of more than 300 people is really
09:01 - surrounding myself with more experienced
09:04 - leaders people who aren't doing this for
09:06 - the first time who aren't in their early
09:08 - 20s people who are really capable
09:10 - managers leaders who've been able to
09:12 - come in and work with me in the team
09:14 - here to take this thing as far as we've
09:17 - got I think you know the more that you
09:19 - can find opportunities to surround
09:20 - yourself with a great team great mentors
09:24 - who've been through the stuff before
09:25 - have more experience than you are
09:27 - smarter than you you do some pretty
09:30 - remarkable things great um okay our next
09:36 - question is from Cedarville high school
09:39 - in Cedarville Michigan what does one
09:45 - personal trait that do you think has
09:47 - made you successful you know the the the
09:56 - the trait that I most admire in great
09:58 - leaders and one that I've always tried
10:01 - to always find in myself is an
10:06 - unstoppable optimism and positivity
10:11 - there is there's a lot of cynicism in
10:13 - the world right there are a lot of
10:14 - people who think that things can't be
10:16 - done shouldn't be done that you know
10:19 - most people have bad intentions or can't
10:21 - be trusted and you know there's
10:23 - something to be said for going out to
10:26 - the world and getting excited staying
10:29 - excited about building stuff about
10:32 - what's possible and even in the face of
10:35 - real adversity or just the real
10:38 - challenges that you run into and you
10:40 - have a vision that you're struggling to
10:42 - create out there in the world to face
10:45 - that with an unstoppable optimism I just
10:47 - I've seen so many people who've been
10:49 - through so much and yet we're unwavering
10:51 - and that optimism and we're able to
10:53 - accomplish so so much so even when
10:56 - things are their hardest over here and
10:57 - believe me we've had some really
10:58 - challenging moments a tumblr where we
11:02 - weren't we weren't sure that we can make
11:04 - it to the other side and yet we faced it
11:06 - with this this kind of
11:07 - Topol optimism and positivity because we
11:10 - were we were determined we believed we
11:13 - believed in the world we believe in
11:14 - ourselves
11:15 - and we believe in this vision that we
11:16 - had and so we just we put our all into
11:18 - it without ever letting that citizen
11:21 - sort of cloud our motivation or cloud
11:24 - our efforts so that positivity is
11:27 - something I really admire and all
11:30 - leaders really everyone but but
11:34 - certainly all leaders and it's something
11:35 - I've really tried to build into our team
11:37 - here I think you spent time with anybody
11:39 - a tumbler you'd see that real come
11:41 - shining positivity and optimism that's
11:45 - great I think that's really good advice
11:47 - for all of us our next question is from
11:50 - Edna brewer middle middle school in
11:53 - Oakland California their school was
11:54 - actually cancelled because of a storm so
11:57 - I'll just read their question to you it
11:59 - is why did you use and choose the name
12:02 - tumblr ah okay so it's it goes back to
12:07 - blogging so everybody has heard of blogs
12:09 - now but if you go back the word blogging
12:12 - kind of came about maybe ten years ago
12:16 - it was when people started to really
12:17 - talk about blogs and people knew what
12:19 - blogs were there was another little
12:22 - community and idea called tumble logging
12:25 - that you guys if I'm sure never heard of
12:27 - but it was it was a thing and there
12:30 - weren't terribly many people doing it
12:31 - but it was as cool sort of different
12:33 - approach to blog so where blogging was
12:36 - really about articles tumble logging
12:38 - were these clever developers programmers
12:41 - and people who are putting these things
12:42 - together that rather than being about
12:44 - articles were all about photos are all
12:46 - about music are all about links so they
12:48 - were often called photo logs or link
12:51 - logs it was a sort of novel different
12:56 - approach to blogging that I just thought
12:59 - was the coolest thing ever so I'm not
13:01 - really a writer so as much as I wanted
13:03 - to have a blog as much as I wanted to
13:04 - express myself on the internet I I had a
13:08 - really hard time with all of these
13:09 - blogging tools but there were these
13:10 - these cool people working on these cool
13:12 - Tum blogs that I just thought were
13:15 - brilliant I thought were incredibly fun
13:17 - and something that I really
13:18 - so tumblr was my answer to hey I really
13:22 - I want I want this thing to exist I
13:24 - think there should be a tool to do it
13:26 - there wasn't a tool to do it and so I
13:28 - packed the tool together to let me
13:31 - create one of these tumble ons the word
13:33 - tumble log never really ended up going
13:34 - everyone anywhere but we renamed tumblr
13:38 - after tumble logs because we know maybe
13:40 - maybe these things are gonna take off so
13:42 - it will make tumblr for tumble logs the
13:44 - same way that like blogger is for blocks
13:46 - and tumblr got very big the idea of
13:49 - tumble logging never really got very big
13:51 - so we've just since then kind of called
13:53 - tumblr blogs blogs but if you go back to
13:56 - the very early days they were actually
13:58 - tumble logs when you sign up for tumblr
13:59 - you gotta come along
14:00 - so this is like way back in our history
14:03 - that I've since tried to forget about
14:05 - because I think all these words are sort
14:06 - of funky but you tumblr it's a it's an
14:08 - okay name right it sounds I think it's
14:10 - nice it sounds good in some foreign
14:12 - languages too which is always good yeah
14:15 - goes way back cool good to know
14:19 - okay our next question is from Balmoral
14:22 - High School in Winnipeg Canada okay hi
14:26 - so we're from Balmoral Hall school for
14:28 - girls and we're actually all in a
14:30 - computer science class so our question
14:32 - it is wetter than most interesting we AZ
14:35 - sink people using tumblr huh the coolest
14:41 - thing about working at tumblr working on
14:43 - tumblr is we work on creative tools
14:49 - right we work on making it a more
14:50 - creative platform and then we put it out
14:53 - there into the world we it's called
14:54 - shipping code right we ship the code
14:56 - don't everybody has the new feature and
14:58 - then we come back like a few hours later
15:01 - come back the next day and you can see
15:04 - literally like tens of thousands
15:06 - hundreds of thousands of ways that
15:07 - people have started to use those
15:09 - features in ways that you just
15:11 - absolutely never expected so I mean some
15:13 - of the things that have been kind of
15:14 - invented on tumblr that we didn't invent
15:16 - but we made the technology a little bit
15:19 - better and then all of a sudden these
15:20 - brilliant creators came along and came
15:23 - up with were things like tumblr supports
15:26 - panoramas I don't know if you knew that
15:27 - so you can actually post like super wide
15:29 - panoramas on your blog on tumblr and
15:31 - they
15:31 - they get this really cool scrubber so
15:33 - you can kind of navigate it it's neat
15:35 - and a little bit different and when we
15:37 - launched that we expected two
15:38 - photographers to go crazy and use it in
15:40 - all sorts of neat ways one of the first
15:42 - communities that picked it up and
15:43 - started doing really cool stuff with it
15:45 - was the indie gaming community so all
15:48 - these people that were designing video
15:49 - games starting to use it to post these
15:51 - super wide screen shots and posting hold
15:53 - levels from their platformers where you
15:56 - could actually receive from like starts
15:57 - and the like of course that the
15:59 - character would hop through such as
16:01 - stuff like that where you just never
16:03 - have expected somebody to use this
16:06 - particular feature this way and yet here
16:08 - it is and it's awesome I mean it is
16:10 - really one of the most fulfilling
16:11 - wonderful things about working on tumblr
16:15 - the the other thing that I always just
16:20 - love to mention is that when you see
16:23 - creators on tumblr that sort of break
16:27 - out of their medium so when you see the
16:29 - photographer on tumblr or the musician
16:31 - on tumblr we even look at somebody like
16:33 - Lorde or Taylor Swift on tumblr right so
16:36 - these are the artists that we're used to
16:37 - listening to we're used to hearing their
16:39 - albums and when they show up on tumblr
16:42 - because tumblr is kind of I think you
16:44 - guys know it's it's much more its
16:50 - expressive across many more dimensions
16:51 - than just you know just your square
16:53 - photos or just your tweets or just your
16:56 - short videos it's sort of an everything
16:58 - in one place so that means when you have
17:00 - like Lorde or Taylor Swift or the
17:03 - aspiring 15 year old musician on tumblr
17:07 - you don't just get their music you also
17:09 - get their photography sometimes you get
17:11 - their poetry or the lyrics that they're
17:13 - working on and so to see some of these
17:15 - artists where we normally only get to
17:17 - listen to them or we normally only get
17:19 - to watch them act or whatever they're
17:21 - whatever their medium is that they
17:23 - normally get to enjoy them through
17:26 - watching them do more than that watching
17:28 - them use tumblr to show us all the sides
17:30 - of their creativity I just think is
17:32 - beautiful I think it's really wonderful
17:33 - and I think it's I'm kind of in truth I
17:36 - don't think most creators are just a
17:38 - single medium I don't think most
17:40 - photographers only make photos I think
17:43 - when you take bear
17:44 - creative people whether there aren't is
17:46 - code music photography illustration I
17:50 - think these are incredibly creative
17:53 - people who have a lot more to offer than
17:55 - just that one thing so when you give
17:57 - them space to do it I think it's just
17:58 - wonderfully surprising and beautiful
18:01 - cool that's really interesting our our
18:03 - next question is from August Martin high
18:06 - school in Queens New York
18:09 - Oh mr. Karp my name is and I live no
18:12 - this is our honors software engineering
18:14 - program what thank you so I want to
18:17 - actually go into that we all love your
18:21 - tumblr program it's amazing platform
18:24 - thank you thank you for actually in
18:27 - Vincente tumblr thank you over so please
18:30 - and thank you so I wanted to go on so
18:34 - article a little bit where you stayed at
18:37 - the ink magazine you stated that you are
18:40 - a very anti schedule so that's not the
18:43 - essential question that wait that's not
18:44 - the session question
18:45 - the central question goes into your time
18:48 - management as a ultra focus CEO of a
18:51 - company like tumblr the thing is how do
18:54 - you have time to manage that and be a
18:55 - creative software developer oh man
19:00 - so you're touching on to things that are
19:01 - just heartbreaking to me so one is that
19:02 - I don't really get to write code at
19:04 - Tumblr anymore which is actually a
19:06 - really shitty part about like building
19:08 - stuff like this is that at some point
19:10 - you start working with people who are
19:12 - much smarter than you are
19:13 - who and many more of them than you and
19:17 - it starts to be the right thing to do to
19:20 - sort of pass the torch and let them be
19:23 - the ones to build tumblr to make it all
19:25 - the stuff that it can be so you know my
19:27 - role here is really shifted from
19:29 - committing code every day to sort of
19:32 - being chief motivator so I'm the the guy
19:35 - just making sure that everybody excited
19:37 - about the vision the direction that they
19:39 - know what the direction is and they feel
19:41 - empowered to make tumblr everything that
19:43 - they can be and you know it was it was
19:45 - very heartbreaking in the beginning it
19:46 - was very hard to let go of that but then
19:48 - you step back and you see how much more
19:50 - were able to do and you see us putting
19:52 - the stuff out there into the world that
19:54 - we're all just so so proud of and you
19:55 - didn't I get to come to work with you
19:57 - brilliant people I'm certainly not
20:00 - bitter about it but it has been a little
20:03 - bit heartbreaking to let go of I do
20:04 - still by the way find like little
20:06 - projects here and there but it's
20:08 - definitely not my day job anymore on
20:10 - that first part of your question though
20:12 - you know the this is something else that
20:14 - I was very stubborn about for a long
20:16 - time
20:17 - I really didn't like having a regimented
20:20 - calendar because I loved to just sort of
20:21 - be able to flow between projects
20:22 - certainly if you guys have worked on the
20:28 - coding projects before you know there's
20:30 - like a real flow that you get into
20:31 - sometimes and it sucks to interrupt that
20:33 - flow and so I for a long time really did
20:37 - insist on not scheduling anything and
20:40 - now that you know the team has grown to
20:42 - more than three hundred people and we
20:45 - have have investors or now we have our
20:48 - parent company I kind of had to just
20:51 - swallow it and now I have a pretty
20:54 - pretty busy calendar which is fine but
20:57 - it's a little bit different so it took
21:00 - me a few years though first few years of
21:01 - tumblr still writing code no calendar we
21:04 - got an awful lot done we're getting more
21:05 - done these days awesome great we have
21:12 - one last question from let's screen high
21:15 - school in time my name is Katie Skinner
21:21 - and our question is what are some
21:25 - emerging platforms or technologies you
21:27 - think are really exciting Nana um to
21:31 - tell you to show of hands real quick I'm
21:33 - very curious do any of your computer
21:34 - labs have 3d printers yet which of you
21:37 - guys have gotten to alright I see one
21:40 - alright looks like there are a couple of
21:42 - them so I man if you have a chance these
21:47 - things have started to get like not
21:50 - cheap but affordable enough that like
21:52 - more and more schools are starting to
21:54 - have them you can even find like
21:56 - services that'll ship stuff to you or
21:59 - local maker spaces that'll have printers
22:01 - that you can borrow
22:04 - 3d printing is I should just say 3d
22:08 - technology right now is like were
22:10 - olds ahead of where it was when I was
22:11 - growing up and I got to tell you I mean
22:13 - I so badly wanted to do 3d stuff I
22:16 - wanted to like make
22:24 - incredible technology but the tools were
22:27 - so so hard when I was growing up so as
22:30 - I've kind of gotten back to that in the
22:31 - last couple years just to sort of see
22:33 - what's going on the thing that's most
22:35 - remarkable to me is the software is good
22:37 - it's easy a lot of its free and you can
22:42 - go on YouTube and like watch a
22:43 - two-minute video on how to do this like
22:45 - super hard advanced thing see it and
22:47 - then like turn around and do it yourself
22:48 - so the software isn't like an incredibly
22:52 - empowering place right now or where all
22:55 - of you guys at home can go and download
22:56 - 3d design software for free get easy
23:01 - tutorials like get rolling with anything
23:03 - from like yeah character design and
23:05 - animation to mechanical like product
23:08 - designs to a technical hardware design
23:11 - you pair that with I imagine some of you
23:14 - guys have heard of or played with
23:16 - Arduinos these uh microcontrollers need
23:21 - to be small little electronic boards
23:23 - that let you go from not just designing
23:25 - a physical product but actually
23:27 - designing a consumer electronic product
23:30 - that does everything from like whites up
23:33 - to controlling a drone I mean really
23:34 - whatever whatever you can do with
23:36 - electricity and then you add these 3d
23:40 - printers that let you design or download
23:44 - an object from the internet I mean that
23:46 - was the most empowering crazy thing to
23:49 - me the first time I downloaded something
23:50 - from the internet and then had it in my
23:52 - hands 30 minutes later so I don't know I
23:55 - am as excited about technology as I've
23:57 - ever been the 3d stuff I just think
23:59 - isn't you know the the whole arm bread
24:02 - and butter at tumblr is empowering
24:03 - creators I think this 3d stuff right now
24:06 - some of the most empowering creative
24:07 - technology that's come along in a while
24:10 - and I'm incredibly excited to see how
24:12 - creators use it and I'm incredibly
24:14 - excited to see how inventors and
24:16 - technologists use it and a lot of
24:18 - friends who are working on some of the
24:20 - companies I'm most excited about right
24:21 - now are using a lot of that technology
24:23 - and the truth is you can have one or two
24:26 - people sitting there with this very
24:27 - powerful software design and stuff
24:28 - prototyping into the printer that's
24:30 - sitting on their desk and take it to
24:33 - market and fabricate millions of these
24:36 - things with
24:37 - a process that like any of you guys can
24:39 - do right now it's pretty I think it's a
24:42 - pretty remarkable moment in technology
24:44 - so if you haven't had a chance yet
24:45 - I'd go screw around with the software I
24:48 - use
24:49 - I mostly use Mac so the the Mac software
24:52 - that I use is called a rhinoceros or
24:53 - rhino3d you can download that one for
24:56 - free I think it cost something on
24:58 - Windows but they're all that there's
24:59 - other free software you can use on
25:00 - Windows find a makerspace or convince
25:04 - your school to get a 3d printer and
25:07 - you'll be off to the races I think that
25:09 - stuff is really really cool really
25:11 - exciting it's really fun to work with
25:12 - cool technology guys thank you so much
25:16 - for the great questions this is so much
25:17 - fun thank you again for joining us and
25:20 - we actually have one more question that
25:22 - we put out a call for on our own tumblr
25:25 - so code.org on tumblr we get questions
25:28 - every r messages every single day with
25:31 - and our most common question is
25:33 - basically I want to learn how to code I
25:36 - want to build an app or something cool
25:38 - but where do I start and I think
25:40 - everyone here is sort of on a different
25:42 - level of their journey so why not ask
25:45 - David himself so I'm not really speaking
25:51 - from experience
25:52 - you know I started doing web development
25:54 - so that was sort of like HTML and then
25:56 - Perl and then PHP so I don't even know
25:58 - if these are things that any of you guys
25:59 - like don't hear these days but the sort
26:04 - of safe suggestion I always make to
26:08 - people who are excited to start making
26:11 - soft you know whatever that is they want
26:12 - to make games they want to make apps is
26:15 - to pick up either the Android or the iOS
26:19 - the objective-c books or toolkits the
26:23 - really great thing about doing the app
26:25 - stuff so so making an app for your your
26:29 - iPhone or your Android phone is the code
26:34 - the programming and the developer kits
26:37 - are really very contained they're very
26:39 - there it's still it's still programming
26:42 - it's a lot to learn if you're new or
26:44 - doing it for the first time but you go
26:47 - to Apple's website and you download the
26:49 - software
26:50 - get a book and like one book and tell
26:53 - you how to create a whole app and you
26:54 - kind of read the book forwards back you
26:56 - you make your your own first app and you
26:59 - load it onto that that phone that you
27:01 - have and you're like kind of off to the
27:02 - races so the one challenge with web
27:04 - development is there's there's a lot
27:06 - involved isn't just writing code it's
27:09 - often how to set up a domain name come
27:12 - by and set up a your own calm how to
27:14 - point that at a server how to set up a
27:16 - server how to upload to write your code
27:18 - and then how to upload it to the server
27:20 - there's a little bit more involved where
27:21 - when you down when you start active
27:23 - element you kind of get the book you
27:25 - download the the tools and you're kind
27:28 - of off to the races so if you're if
27:32 - you're excited to get started with this
27:34 - stuff if you have friends or family who
27:35 - are excited to get started with the
27:36 - stuff one of the easiest things you can
27:38 - do is just go on Amazon look for the
27:41 - Android or iPhone programming books that
27:46 - have the best review of reviews grab the
27:48 - book and like jump into that thing and
27:53 - you'll come out the other side with a
27:54 - mobile game or a mobile app and a lot of
27:58 - the skills that you need to build a
27:59 - website or build a whole lot of other
28:01 - software to you guys will do fine best
28:05 - of luck really guys and when you're
28:08 - looking for gigs tumblr.com slash jobs
