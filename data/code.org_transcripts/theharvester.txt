00:08 - This is the Harvester.
00:09 - She runs a big farm and needs your help
00:12 - to pick the crops that are ready to be harvested.
00:16 - Use the "move" and "turn" blocks to get the harvester from crop to crop.
00:22 - Then use the pick blocks to collect all of the corn, lettuce and pumpkins.
00:29 - The bottom right corner will show you how many are available at that spot.
00:34 - If you see more than one
00:36 - you'll need to pick the crops multiple times in the same square.
00:41 - Keep an eye out for sprouts!
00:43 - You won't know what crop those are
00:45 - or how many there are
00:46 - until the program is run.
00:48 - So your code may need to check what kind of crop is there
00:51 - before picking it.
00:56 - The sun is shining and it's time to harvest!
00:58 - "Lettuce" get started.
