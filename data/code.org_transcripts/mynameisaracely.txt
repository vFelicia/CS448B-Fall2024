00:11 - My name is Aracely Casillas.
00:14 - I'm the oldest in my family, and I'm also the one
that can handle Spanish and English both
00:20 - at the same time.
00:22 - So I've always been like a
third parent at home
00:39 - Both my parents dropped out in middle
school and elementary so they don't
00:46 - really have much experience with going
to college and the process of getting there.
00:51 - Not having the support of my
parents has affected me.
00:55 - It becomes very challenging sometimes to keep motivated
00:59 - when they don't understand what's going on.
01:03 - A lot of our students end up not
going to college.
01:05 - They need jobs, they want jobs, their parents know what jobs are.
01:08 - They don't know how to navigate the world of higher education.
01:12 - And so I saw that as an opportunity...
01:14 - what can we provide to them as skills or,
01:17 - to provide them with the background so they can go and get well paying jobs?
01:22 - So when I took
Computer Science Principles last year
01:26 - Mr. Lozano was my teacher.
01:29 - He knows my dynamic at home and he has been a mentor to help me, and guide me
01:36 - through my step-by-step process into the computer science field.
01:41 - She walked in my
class really not knowing what she was getting into.
01:44 - I promised her she was going to enjoy it.
01:48 - And I promised her she would be really
good at it.
01:53 - When I found out the statistics about how little women and Latinos are in the field...
01:58 - that's when I realized that that was the field for me.
02:16 - I feel like it's my responsibility to help guide other
Latinas, other girls into to this field.
02:23 - Show them that if I can do it they can
do it too.
02:27 - We need to have computer science for
everybody.
02:29 - We need to have that open access to everybody.
02:33 - Because I learned all the principles of
computer science I was able to get into
02:38 - Python in the college level and I'm very
excited to see what college I get into next year.
02:47 - I mean everyone wants to
change the world.
02:48 - And I think that technology is how I'm going to do it.
