00:07 - In graph paper programming, we help explain
how coding works by trying to help people
00:15 - recreate drawings using only arrows and scribbles.
00:21 - One person is given a small drawing on graph
paper and they need to go through using only
00:27 - specific arrows and try to describe how to
recreate that drawing.
00:33 - In this activity, the only symbols you can
use are these: move one square forward, one
00:41 - square backward, move one square up, move
one square down, change to next color, and
00:50 - fill in your square with color.
00:53 - Once we have that coded up, we can hand it
off to another person who can read the code
00:59 - and try and recreate the picture.
