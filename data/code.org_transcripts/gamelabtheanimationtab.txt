00:06 - Hi I'm Aston and I was the first
software engineer hired at DropBox.
00:11 - I also work with an organization called
dev color.
00:14 - 'dev color' is a nonprofit that advances careers of black software engineers.
00:20 - Sprites make it much easier to organize your code, but visually they're still just rectangles.
00:25 - To make our creations come to life,
we want to add images to our sprites.
00:30 - We'll start with the simple program you've seen before
that creates a single rectangular sprite.
00:37 - Before we can turn this rectangle into 
something more fun, we need to tell Game Lab about the image we want to use.
00:43 - All images and drawings you add to your project are created and managed in the animation tab.
00:48 - To switch back and forth between your code and animations, use a toggle in the upper left corner.
00:54 - To add a new animation, click the plus sign. 
This will open a library of images that are
01:00 - already built into Game Lab.
01:02 - From the library, you can browse the
categories to find what you're looking for.
01:10 - Once you've selected an image, it'll be added to your project and shown on the left.
01:15 - If you like, you can also change the name of your image.
01:19 - So, here we've added an image in the animation tab and we have code that creates a basic sprite.
01:25 - Now I need to put those two together and tell the computer that we want this particular sprite.
01:31 - We'll use the setAnimation() block to do this.
01:34 - First, we use
the name of our sprite
01:38 - and the name of the image we selected
in the animation tab.
01:43 - Now when we run our program, the sprite 
will be drawn with image we selected.
01:52 - All of the sprite's properties can still
be modified as usual to do things like moving across the screen.
01:59 - You're not limited to the images that come built in the Game Lab. You can also choose to
upload an image from your computer
02:07 - or draw something yourself. 
In fact, you can edit any image in the animation tab using the pixel editor.
02:14 - Using the different commands in the pixel editor, you can easily draw erase or modify images.
02:22 - To adjust the dimensions of an image, just make changes in the menu on the right side.
02:27 - It's also just one quick to flip your image to face the opposite direction.
02:32 - If you like an image you've made, but want to make some changes, just make a copy.
02:36 - There are lots of helpful little tools 
in the pixel editor. Play around with them on your own and see what they do.
02:44 - Back in your code, the drop
down of animations makes it easy to pick
02:47 - which animation your sprite should use
until you find the perfect look.
02:52 - Adding images or your own drawings to sprites
lets you unleash your creativity and make
02:56 - your programs really your own. Let's get
to it!
