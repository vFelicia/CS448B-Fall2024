00:06 - To build your own apps you're going to need to start designing screens and elements from scratch.
00:11 - App Lab makes this easy to do with Design Mode.
00:15 - Use the switch on top of your app to go into design mode.
00:20 - You can add new elements by dragging them onto the screen.
00:24 - You can move them around to different locations
00:27 - and change their size by dragging the
bottom right corner.
00:31 - To change an element's properties use the controls on the right.
00:36 - For example, it's really easy to change this button's text,
00:42 - color,
00:46 - and font size.
00:48 - When you add a new element to your screen it'll get a generic ID like button1.
00:53 - It's a good idea to change this button's ID to something more meaningful like "rightButton".
00:58 - So that you'll know which one it is when you go to the program.
01:03 - If you add an element to your app by mistake,
01:05 - just drag it out or hit the delete.
01:08 - You can add entirely new screens to your app
01:10 - by dragging in a screen element
01:12 - From the drop-down at the top you can quickly
01:14 - switch back and forth between the
screens you create.
01:20 - Inside your app, you'll need a way to switch between all of these screens
01:25 - so the setScreen block has been added to the toolbox.
01:28 - Use "setScreen" inside the "onEvent" block
01:31 - to change screens at the click of a button.
01:35 - In the next few levels you'll be working on a single project.
01:39 - First you'll add a button then you'll add a new screen
01:42 - and finally you'll write code so that the
button switches to the new screen.
