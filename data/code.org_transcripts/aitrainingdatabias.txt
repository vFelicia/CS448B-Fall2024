00:07 - Machine learning is only as good as the
training data you put into it.
00:11 - So, it's super important to use high quality data, and lots of it.
00:16 - But if data is important, it's worth asking where does training data come from?
00:22 - Often, computers are collecting training data from people like you and me,
00:26 - without any effort on our part.
00:28 - A video streaming service might keep track of what you watch, then it can recognize patterns
00:31 - in that data to recommend what you might want to watch next.
00:37 - Other times, you're directly asked to help, like when a website asks you to spot street signs and photos,
00:43 - You're providing training data to help a
machine learn to see, and maybe even one day drive.
00:52 - Medical researchers can use
medical images as training data to teach
00:56 - computers how to recognize and diagnose diseases.
01:00 - Machine Learning needs hundreds and thousands of images, and training direction from a doctor
01:05 - who knows what to look for, before it can correctly identify disease.
01:10 - Even with thousands of examples, there can be problems with the computer's predictions.
01:15 - If X-ray data is only collected from men, then the computer's predictions may only work for men.
01:21 - It may not recognize diseases when
asked to diagnose the X-ray of a woman.
01:26 - This blind spot in the training data
creates something called bias.
01:31 - Biased data favors some things, and de-prioritizes or excludes others.
01:36 - Depending on how training data is collected, who is doing the collecting, and how the data is fed,
01:41 - there is a chance that
human bias is included in the data.
01:45 - By learning from bias data, the computer may make biased predictions,
01:50 - whether the people training the computer
are aware of it or not.
01:54 - When you are looking at training data, ask yourself two questions:
01:58 - Is this enough data to accurately train a computer?
02:02 - And, does this data represent all possible scenarios and users without bias?
02:07 - This is where you, as the human training, play a crucial role.
02:11 - It's up to you to give your machine unbiased data.
02:14 - That means collecting tons of examples, from lots of sources.
02:19 - Remember, when you pick and choose data for machine learning,
02:22 - you're actually programming the algorithm, using training data instead of code.
02:27 - The data IS the code.
02:30 - The better the data you provide, the better the computer will learn.
