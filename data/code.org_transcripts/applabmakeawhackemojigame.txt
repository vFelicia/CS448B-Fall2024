00:04 - hi my name is mayal Shaw I'm one of the
00:05 - engineers at code.org and I helped build
00:08 - applab and today we're going to
00:10 - demonstrate an app that I built called
00:12 - whack and emoji and uh I'll talk about
00:14 - how we actually built it here's what
00:16 - whack and Emoji looks like um there's a
00:18 - little Emoji that's going to appear on a
00:19 - bunch of green buttons and you have to
00:21 - click on it every time you click on the
00:23 - Emoji you get 100 points every time you
00:25 - click on something else you lose 100
00:27 - points and at the end it shows you how
00:29 - many points you and there's a little
00:30 - button to go and play again so let's
00:33 - talk about how to build it so I'm making
00:35 - a new applab project I'm going to give
00:36 - it a
00:39 - name like
00:45 - that we're going to have three different
00:47 - screens on the app there's going to be
00:49 - the welcome screen there's going to be
00:51 - the uh game screen where you actually
00:54 - playing the game and there's going to be
00:55 - a screen where you see your final score
00:57 - and get an option to play again so so
01:00 - let's make those screens I'm going to
01:01 - make a screen for the game here I'm
01:03 - going to make a screen for welcoming the
01:06 - user and that'll be the first one
01:08 - they'll see and I'll make a screen
01:11 - for showing their final
01:14 - score now let's build the controls that
01:17 - will actually go on the welcome screen
01:19 - and welcome screen will be pretty simple
01:21 - it'll be the text
01:23 - saying welcome to whack an emoji bang
01:28 - bang bang nice big
01:32 - font not that
01:35 - big and we'll put it right there and
01:38 - then we'll put big green buttons that
01:40 - says start new
01:43 - game start new
01:48 - game
01:50 - here and we'll call the button play
01:52 - button we're going to wire up what the
01:54 - play button does in just a little bit uh
01:57 - your screen size is 320 pixels across
02:00 - and 480 pixels down and it doesn't sound
02:03 - like a lot but that's actually a pretty
02:05 - good number for any game that's going to
02:07 - show up on your phone next we're going
02:09 - to build the game screen the game screen
02:11 - is going to be a grid of uh four green
02:14 - buttons uh going left four green buttons
02:17 - going down and then there'll be a little
02:19 - smiley face that will appear on some of
02:21 - the green buttons so at the bottom we
02:24 - have a label showing what your score is
02:26 - and a number that's going to
02:28 - change and let's let's drag a background
02:31 - image on here that's going to have our
02:33 - game board and we're just going to use
02:35 - this file which I've already uploaded if
02:38 - you want to precisely position your
02:40 - control you can use the properties Tab
02:42 - and say this is going to go at exactly
02:45 - this location and be exactly this size
02:49 - so let's put the background right there
02:53 - and then we'll have a label that's going
02:55 - to be the Emoji that's going to hop
02:57 - around from button to button and so this
03:00 - is the Emoji
03:03 - label and the text is going to be an
03:07 - emoji right
03:09 - there let's make it
03:12 - bigger and let's put it on the first
03:15 - button so put it at
03:18 - 6060 right there let's make it a little
03:21 - bigger okay um and now um the code so
03:27 - we're going to have a function to
03:29 - actually place the
03:31 - game
03:32 - and um the game is going to be about 15
03:36 - seconds and every second the Emoji is
03:39 - going to jump from one position to
03:41 - another position so to have something
03:44 - happen every 15 seconds we can use the
03:46 - set interval function and you give it a
03:50 - function to call every so many seconds
03:52 - so we're going to have the move Emoji
03:55 - function and we're going to call it
03:57 - every 1,000 millisecond seconds or every
04:01 - every second and then to end the game
04:04 - what we're going to do is say set
04:05 - timeout and that'll call a function
04:07 - after a certain amount of time and the
04:08 - function we're going to call is endgame
04:11 - and we're going to call that
04:14 - after 15,000 milliseconds or 15 seconds
04:19 - now let's define the two
04:20 - functions function move
04:25 - Emoji function and game
04:34 - so to move the Emoji uh I'm going to set
04:38 - the position of the Emoji
04:41 - label to be some
04:45 - random uh location in here so I need to
04:47 - generate two random numbers random
04:51 - number 03 so this will generate a random
04:54 - number between 0 and three
04:57 - inclusive and this will generate a
04:59 - second second random
05:04 - number okay to figure out where the
05:07 - Emoji is going to go we're going to call
05:10 - set
05:11 - position on the
05:15 - Emoji and then uh we know that the
05:18 - position is going to begin at
05:21 - 6060 and is going to be offet by the
05:25 - random number we generate in the x axis
05:28 - time 60
05:31 - and the random number we generate and
05:32 - the Y AIS time 50 that should line up
05:36 - pretty well with this let's just try it
05:39 - out yeah there we
05:43 - go then we also have functions for when
05:45 - you click on the Emoji label we're going
05:48 - to increase your score by 100 and we're
05:50 - going to update the score counter here
05:52 - when you click on the background image
05:54 - we're going to reduce your score by 100
05:55 - and we're going to update the score
05:58 - counter
06:03 - image okay um so we have these functions
06:06 - defined and now when you end the
06:09 - game we're going to set the
06:12 - screen to uh the score
06:18 - screen and we're going to set the text
06:20 - on the final score label to be whatever
06:25 - your score
06:28 - was okay so let's try this out see how
06:31 - it
06:41 - looks now let's try this out and see how
06:43 - it
06:45 - looks so gives me the welcome screen and
06:48 - let's start a new game and there's the
06:50 - Emoji and it's kind of hopping around on
06:53 - spot to spot and when I click on it my
06:56 - score goes
06:58 - up and when I click somewhere else my
07:01 - score goes
07:02 - down I need to make this label a little
07:05 - bigger so let's just do
07:09 - that run it
07:15 - again and there we
07:18 - go you can do things like if we wanted
07:21 - to make the game harder and have the
07:22 - Emoji move around faster we can change
07:25 - the interval from say 1 second to half a
07:31 - second and now it's moving around a lot
07:34 - faster probably too fast for me to
07:37 - actually click on
07:41 - it or you can make it easier and make
07:44 - the number go up but I think one
07:46 - second's fine for
07:48 - now let's just play a quick
07:58 - game
08:05 - and once you're done if you want to
08:06 - share it with someone you can click the
08:08 - share
08:09 - button and you get a link you can send
08:11 - them a link on Facebook or Twitter or a
08:14 - text message and they can play the game
08:15 - for themselves we built this app in just
08:18 - 5 minutes but if you wanted to remix
08:19 - this there's a whole lot of things you
08:21 - can do you can add sound effects you can
08:23 - change the appearance of it you can
08:24 - change the difficulty you can even use
08:27 - our data interface to build a scoreboard
08:29 - so you can compete with your friends
08:30 - thanks for trying out applab and we
08:32 - can't wait to see what you build with
08:39 - it
