00:15 - finish and make it do something i'm
00:17 - always one of those that has has hand
00:19 - movements and stuff like i don't really

00:22 - unique i like to fidget
00:26 - i also love the fact that anything i do
00:28 - does have a lot of impact
00:31 - i'm a software engineer i work on our
00:33 - payment fraud detection team effectively
00:35 - we catch bad guys anytime that you
00:38 - tap buy on your android app or anytime
00:40 - google accepts money we're there to make
00:42 - sure that they don't get away with uh
00:43 - stealing money from our users or google
00:46 - itself we call them fraudsters by the
00:47 - way uh that is actually the official
00:50 - name fraudsters we improve our systems
00:53 - they're improving their systems they're
00:54 - engineers too in a lot of ways and so
00:55 - they'll have like this infrastructure
00:57 - that's attacking us and we'll have this
00:58 - infrastructure that's stopping them and
00:59 - so it's like
01:01 - you get to wake up every day and kind of
01:02 - go like i'm going to catch some people
01:03 - that are bad yes

01:08 - and terrifying all at the same time
01:09 - which is you know the way that life has
01:11 - got to be i think
01:13 - when i was like 12 or 13 i do remember
01:15 - the first time i made one of those
01:17 - little lego mindstorms like actually
01:18 - just move
01:19 - it had a little like puzzle piece
01:21 - interface you could do and you just like
01:22 - take these puzzle pieces and tell it
01:23 - like move forward turn left do this kind
01:26 - of do this again with just a few
01:27 - commands i can have this little robot
01:29 - run around the room and search for light
01:32 - once i got that going it was kind of
01:33 - like you sort of expand from there you
01:35 - know then what like a for loop is you
01:36 - know what these other things are and
01:38 - then like from there i was able to kind
01:39 - of move on there's a little bit of
01:41 - breaking your brain to sort of think
01:42 - like a computer because like you are in
01:44 - a lot of ways it's like learning a new
01:45 - language you have to kind of like go
01:47 - okay
01:48 - now i get it i can now think in that
01:50 - that way
01:52 - stick with it it there will be a point
01:54 - where you're kind of like oh
