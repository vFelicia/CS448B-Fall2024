00:06 - Have you ever thought of math not just as
a way to calculate numbers but to communicate
00:11 - ideas?
00:13 - Just like English, Spanish or Chinese, math
is a language, a way to talk to others.
00:20 - When we speak, we use nouns like bread, tomato,
mustard and cheese to describe things.
00:25 - And verbs like toast, cut and melt to describe
actions.
00:29 - Math is the same way, using numbers like 1,
2 and 3 to describe things and operators like
00:36 - addition and subtraction to describe actions
that you can do to those things.
00:41 - Just as you can toast a piece of bread, a
person can also add four and five.
00:47 - Let's get familiar with how to program in
Code Studio.
00:50 - Your screen is split into three main parts.
00:52 - On the left, is the play area where your program
will be evaluated.
00:57 - The instructions for level are written below.
01:01 - This middle area is the toolbox.
01:03 - Each of these blocks is part of our math programming
language.
01:07 - Later on, we'll many views of blocks in each
menu item.
01:11 - The white space on the right is called the
work space.
01:14 - This is where we'll build our program.
01:15 - To link blocks together, drag them out to
your work space and drop them next to each
01:20 - other.
01:21 - When you see the yellow arrow, they'll snap
together.
01:25 - If you want to delete a block, you can drag
it back to the toolbox.
01:28 - When your program is ready, you can hit the
run button over here.
01:35 - After your program has been evaluated, you
can hit reset to get back to the beginning.
01:40 - Have fun programming!
