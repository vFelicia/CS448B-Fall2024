00:05 - [Music]
00:12 - okay guys for our lesson today we're
00:14 - going to play Four Loop fun and this is
00:17 - a dice game so we are going to get
00:20 - together in pairs and we're going to
00:23 - roll dice and we're going to learn how
00:26 - to use for Loops so first we need to
00:29 - talk about what for Loop is because a
00:32 - for Loop is different than kind of Loops
00:34 - we've used before
00:37 - so what do you remember about a
00:40 - loop yes it's something that repeats
00:42 - over and over and tell you how it to
00:44 - stop a a loop is something that repeats
00:47 - and you get to tell it when to stop
00:48 - right so we might have a
00:52 - loop and in CS fundamentals we call it a
00:55 - repeat block right so we might repeat
01:02 - something five
01:04 - times and the thing that we repeat five
01:07 - times might be something like move
01:13 - forward now when we repeat something
01:16 - five times we go through and it's it's
01:19 - kind of like it's keeping track one at a
01:22 - time so it'll have a variable if you
01:26 - remember that from when we were talking
01:28 - about um the brace bracelets or the Sun
01:31 - Catchers then we can have a variable
01:35 - that starts out at zero times and it'll
01:38 - go through and it'll say one and it'll
01:40 - go through and say two three four and
01:45 - five and then it'll be all done so
01:48 - that's how this is going to work but
01:51 - there's a more powerful Loop out there
01:54 - that we're going to learn about today
01:56 - and it's called the for Loop now with a
01:58 - for Loop
02:00 - we get to choose where it starts maybe
02:03 - we want it to start at zero maybe we
02:06 - want it to start at three right so we
02:10 - have a for
02:13 - Loop and then we have a variable or a
02:18 - counter of some kind and we're going to
02:25 - say for our counter and we get to say
02:28 - where it starts
02:30 - so where do we want our counter to start
02:33 - yeah start at 10 let's have it start at
02:36 - 10 so from we're going to have it start
02:40 - as equal to
02:43 - 10 and
02:46 - then when do we want it to stop so at
02:52 - 30 okay so when the counter is equal to
02:57 - 30 why did you write two equals that's a
03:00 - very good question so what I'm doing now
03:02 - is called PSE suda code and it's kind of
03:04 - like what a computer would use but it's
03:06 - more englishy so uh when I do this it
03:11 - means set that equal to 10 when I do
03:15 - this it means compare to see if it's
03:17 - equal to 10 so it's two different kinds
03:20 - of
03:21 - equals and now what do we want to add by
03:24 - do we want to count by ones or do we
03:26 - want to count by something else fives
03:29 - count by five
03:30 - that's
03:31 - awesome so that's going to be our
03:34 - Loop and while we're running our four
03:37 - Loop do you put stuff in variables you
03:40 - put stuff in variables so that you can
03:44 - change what happens throughout your
03:46 - program and still use the same word to
03:50 - refer to whatever that number is going
03:52 - to be because we don't know at any given
03:56 - time what the value of this is going to
03:57 - be we only know what ever that value is
04:00 - we need it so for this we're going
04:04 - to
04:08 - say counter now are we actually going to
04:12 - say counter counter counter no this is
04:17 - kind of like chorus where it means
04:19 - something different than what we're
04:21 - reading right so to start out the first
04:24 - time through what are we actually going
04:25 - to
04:26 - say go ahead and Shout It Out five 10 oh
04:30 - wait wait where are we starting 15 okay
04:34 - now the first time through we're going
04:36 - to
04:37 - say and then the second time through 15
04:40 - and then 20
04:43 - 25 30
04:46 - 35 where do we stop there you go okay so
04:51 - that's how a for Loop works it lets you
04:53 - choose your start Point your end point
04:58 - and how much you count by we call that
04:59 - the increment can you guys say increment
05:02 - increment increment it's like increasing
05:05 - right but we're increasing something by
05:08 - the same amount over and over and that's
05:12 - how we're going to play this
05:14 - game dang
05:16 - it okay it is a dice game so you got
05:22 - this grid that you're going to play with
05:25 - and you're going to play with a
05:27 - partner and you're going to roll one
05:30 - dice and you're going to find out what
05:32 - your starting number is by the value of
05:33 - the one dice and then you're going to
05:36 - roll three dice or the same die three
05:38 - times and add them all up and that's
05:41 - going to be your ending
05:43 - number and then you'll roll to see how
05:46 - many you count by you'll go through and
05:50 - you'll Circle all the numbers as you go
05:53 - through by adding them all up and having
05:55 - the highest score yeah what if your
05:58 - counting number can't add up to your
06:00 - ending number then you do the last
06:03 - counting number before you get to the
06:05 - ending number
06:08 - okay all right so let's try this and
06:11 - I'll come around and help on the first
06:12 - round there are three rounds you get to
06:15 - play and there's a
06:17 - example if you want to see how other
06:19 - people play it
06:23 - okay so you're going to do your first
06:27 - roll here take this okay so write a four
06:31 - there and then make a little bracket
06:34 - around the four so you know that's where
06:36 - you're
06:37 - starting there you go and now you have
06:39 - to roll three times okay why three times
06:43 - because you have to get a big number a
06:45 - high number to know what your ending
06:46 - number is so it's two
06:51 - plus four plus 6 2 + 6
06:58 - Plus four so what's 2 + 6 +
07:01 - [Music]
07:03 - 4 what's 6 + 4 10 what's 10 + 2 okay so
07:09 - now do one this
07:11 - direction around the
07:13 - 12 so that's how far you get to go now
07:17 - you have to figure out how many you get
07:19 - to move by okay do so write your 12 here
07:25 - okay you have to roll one more
07:27 - time is
07:33 - one oh that's a good roll so you put a
07:35 - one
07:37 - there so now here here's so now Circle
07:42 - four and now Circle every number add one
07:46 - add one add one and then you have to add
07:48 - all those up together and that's your
07:49 - score for the round okay
07:52 - [Music]
08:00 - this game is actually a little bit
08:02 - complicated so it helps if you have a
08:05 - document camera where you can play
08:07 - around with your class and show them
08:09 - where to start and where to
08:11 - stop it also helps to take the start
08:13 - number and make a parentheses around it
08:16 - and the end number and make a
08:17 - parentheses around it so that you can
08:20 - see clearly when you've gotten to your
08:22 - stopping point
