00:15 - hello out there
00:16 - thank you for joining us my name is dan
00:20 - and i am a curriculum development
00:21 - manager here at code.org
00:23 - and thank you so much for joining us for
00:25 - our afternoon session of
00:27 - code bytes i'll make a little camera
00:29 - adjustment so that you can see my
00:31 - wonderful um
00:32 - head accessory going on up here um thank
00:35 - you so much for joining us
00:36 - in this episode of code bytes we are
00:38 - going to be talking about artificial
00:39 - intelligence
00:40 - or ai and we're going to teach a
00:42 - computer to classify different
00:44 - images um and i'm super excited because
00:46 - you're coded or we believe that
00:48 - anyone can code and so i am excited to
00:51 - be joined by my
00:52 - father eric and together we're going to
00:55 - learn about artificial intelligence
00:57 - you want to come join me up on the stage
00:58 - round of applause
01:00 - round of applause for eric here hey
01:03 - folks
01:03 - there we go right here we have been this
01:06 - is very important we are now
01:07 - matching a little bit i have my code
01:09 - chart and he is of course the code
01:12 - guest and so we are very excited to be
01:14 - um
01:15 - facilitating this investigation into
01:17 - artificial intelligence
01:19 - um so first of all so welcome pops it's
01:21 - good to see you it's been a long time
01:22 - yes
01:23 - absolutely can you share how old you are
01:25 - with the world
01:27 - i i know i look young but um i'm really
01:30 - 72.
01:31 - 70 to accept generations and we're going
01:34 - to talk about ai have you
01:35 - have you done any work with ai before
01:39 - not knowingly not knowingly what are
01:40 - some ways you think ai
01:42 - is like impacting your life right now
01:49 - the news in what way well i get my daily
01:52 - news brief
01:53 - and i notice that it's geared
01:56 - specifically to me
01:58 - so like the recommendations yeah the
01:59 - recommendation it's saying things like
02:01 - we think you'll like this we think
02:02 - you'll like that you know what you're
02:03 - exactly right
02:04 - any of those recommendations things like
02:06 - on netflix or spotify we think you'll
02:07 - like this we think you'll like that
02:09 - that's ai okay um so thank you so much
02:12 - for joining us
02:13 - here um and we know that you out there
02:15 - in the world are joining us as well we'd
02:16 - love to know where you're from
02:18 - there's a couple of ways you can tell us
02:20 - there's this link that you can
02:22 - go to code.org map and you can tell us
02:25 - where you're from
02:27 - and i think we're going to switch over
02:28 - and take a look at all the folks who are
02:30 - joining us right now
02:32 - we have over 400 viewers tuning in
02:35 - a look at all these people from all over
02:38 - not just the us all over the world
02:39 - wait down in antarctica we have someone
02:42 - who do you know in antarctica
02:43 - santa claus that's very true
02:47 - so we probably have antarctica on the
02:49 - screen we have the us i see i'm we're in
02:51 - arizona i live in tucson so i wonder if
02:53 - there's some arizona folks
02:55 - oh and i see people in the chat sharing
02:57 - where they're from thank you so much
02:59 - oh this is wonderful well we are going
03:01 - to go ahead and get started
03:03 - and so this week we're celebrating the
03:05 - hour of code which is when millions of
03:07 - students like yourselves are learning
03:08 - the basics of computer science
03:10 - and this event has passed over 1 billion
03:12 - student engagements did you know that 1
03:14 - billion people
03:15 - that's crazy right yeah pretty amazing
03:18 - pretty amazing
03:18 - reaching students in every city around
03:21 - the world
03:22 - and so we are going to do a couple of
03:24 - things today we're going to train an ai
03:26 - to recognize different fish to help it
03:28 - clean up the ocean
03:29 - we're going to train an ai from our
03:31 - webcam in order to recognize sign
03:33 - language which is going to be really
03:34 - cool
03:35 - and we're talking about some strategies
03:36 - involving bias and harm
03:38 - to avoid those when we're working with
03:40 - artificial intelligence
03:41 - some really deep stuff going on wait so
03:43 - are we teaching the people about
03:45 - sign or are we teaching the fish we're
03:47 - going to teach
03:48 - well that's a good question here i can
03:49 - tell you exactly who we're going to
03:50 - teach
03:51 - okay so we're going to teach our friend
03:54 - ai bot
03:55 - right here this is a i bought floating
03:56 - in the world and his job is to clean up
03:59 - the ocean
04:00 - but ai bot has a problem you see so
04:02 - we're going to start with ourselves
04:04 - first
04:04 - all right so like because we have
04:06 - intelligence we have natural
04:07 - intelligence and one of the ways we know
04:08 - that is
04:09 - [Laughter]
04:12 - okay do i not always have natural no no
04:13 - no no no
04:15 - thank you so much so other things
04:19 - we can do this thing as human beings we
04:21 - can close our eyes
04:22 - and when i say the word fish i want you
04:25 - to think of the first thing that pops
04:26 - into your head and those of you
04:27 - participating as well in the chat
04:29 - i want you to try that too close your
04:31 - eyes and when i say the word
04:32 - fish type in the chat what type of fish
04:36 - do you see
04:37 - ready three two one fish what kind of
04:40 - fish did you see when you closed your
04:41 - eyes and thought of a fish
04:42 - soda fish you know one of those tropical
04:44 - fish with the
04:46 - the appendages that go up and down and
04:49 - and
04:49 - uh they look superfluous but they're not
04:51 - uh i guess they have some function
04:53 - you know it's beautiful but small very
04:56 - colorful
04:57 - with like the extra little like
04:58 - appendages and things there's like those
04:59 - deep sea fish that are all the way down
05:00 - to the ocean
05:01 - coral reef the coral reef fish see
05:03 - that's that's a fish when we think of it
05:05 - yes i thought of like nemo from finding
05:07 - nemo i thought of the little clownfish
05:08 - design
05:09 - but important thing is that we have
05:11 - these mental models for what a fish is
05:14 - and our ai bot does not have the same
05:17 - model
05:18 - he has no idea what a fish is so one of
05:21 - the first things that we need to do is
05:22 - give it a machine
05:24 - learning model just like we have a
05:25 - mental model it needs a machine learning
05:28 - model
05:28 - to know what a fish is so what do you
05:30 - think about this is that a fish
05:31 - yeah i think so too that's a fish what
05:34 - about this one
05:34 - uh yeah yeah what about this is that
05:36 - fish well
05:38 - as far as i know no i agree with you
05:40 - that is not a fish
05:41 - so we're going to say that this is not a
05:43 - fish now what about this
05:45 - no i think so too i'm going to kind of
05:47 - click through some others fish and not
05:49 - fish and what we're doing
05:51 - is we're giving ai bot these mental
05:53 - images we're letting it figure out what
05:55 - are the things that are fish
05:57 - versus not fish and it might start to
05:58 - notice some patterns it'll notice
06:00 - patterns with like
06:01 - how the the image is shaped it'll notice
06:05 - patterns with the colors it'll notice
06:07 - patterns with the features
06:09 - fish have eyes and mouth and trash does
06:12 - not
06:12 - and when we've done this for a while we
06:14 - can have aibot
06:16 - test out and see how it does based on
06:19 - this machine learning model that it's
06:20 - done
06:21 - you ready to see how it does yeah so
06:22 - this so what should it do with this this
06:24 - light bulb should keep it get rid of it
06:25 - get rid of it should get rid of it let's
06:26 - find out okay
06:28 - what right away it made a mistake
06:33 - well this is good though it's getting
06:34 - rid of that that's a fish that's a nope
06:38 - clearly we made some mistakes in here
06:40 - somewhere ai bot does not have a very
06:42 - clear mental model
06:43 - of what or rather a machine learning
06:44 - model of what a fish is versus not a
06:46 - fish
06:47 - we can even investigate a little bit and
06:49 - take a look at the things that ai bot
06:51 - has learned
06:52 - so ai bot thinks all of these things are
06:55 - fish
06:56 - and over here it thinks all of these
06:58 - things
06:59 - are not fish
07:03 - and so what's happened is aibot has
07:04 - noticed patterns
07:06 - it's noticed some commonalities it's
07:08 - maybe tried to figure out with its
07:09 - mental model what a fish is
07:11 - for example like most of these fish look
07:12 - round right yeah so i think that's why i
07:14 - thought the light bulb was the fish
07:15 - because light bubbles around
07:16 - my boat so how do you think we can fix
07:18 - this with ai bot how can we make sure
07:20 - that it doesn't make those same mistakes
07:21 - we need more fish
07:22 - examples we need more fish examples but
07:25 - isn't like there's more than just fish
07:27 - in the sea right yeah there's like
07:29 - seahorses and starfish
07:30 - even if we trained it to recognize all
07:32 - the fish wouldn't it still get rid of
07:33 - those other ocean creatures too
07:37 - i think that'd be like a problem i don't
07:39 - know so okay so with my ai experience i
07:42 - know but i'm sure that if you
07:43 - put enough information in it'll be able
07:45 - to discern the difference
07:47 - i agree with that enough and varied
07:49 - information
07:50 - it can figure it out that's like the key
07:52 - principle of ai look at you you can go
07:54 - apply for ai jobs now you can go work at
07:56 - like amazon or google or microsoft
07:58 - look at that so
08:01 - we have just trained this little ai bot
08:03 - in order to tell the difference between
08:05 - fish
08:06 - and not fish and it's built its own
08:08 - little machine learning model
08:10 - and this process where we gave it some
08:11 - data we
08:13 - let it train on itself and then we
08:15 - tested it to see how it does
08:16 - that's the really common process that
08:18 - happens with ai
08:19 - all the time if you wanted to play
08:22 - around and keep going with this little
08:24 - tutorial
08:25 - you can find all that information here
08:26 - at code.org
08:28 - oceans which is pretty cool but we're
08:30 - going to switch gears a little bit and
08:31 - we're going to go to a different program
08:33 - we're going to go to a program called
08:34 - teachable machine
08:36 - and the thing that teachable machine
08:38 - does which is really cool is instead of
08:40 - training images just on the fish on
08:42 - there
08:43 - we can have it train on our webcam up
08:45 - here okay
08:46 - so in order to do that if you decided to
08:48 - do this at home and you wanted to play
08:49 - around
08:50 - i would recommend just googling
08:51 - teachable machine which is a nice thing
08:53 - to do because google makes this program
08:55 - so then you'll find it really easy
08:56 - google will point you right there
08:58 - and so one thing that we can do is we
09:01 - can use our webcam to train things now i
09:03 - need to do something special that you
09:05 - won't have to do at home i need to turn
09:06 - off my video here
09:08 - so that i can turn on the webcam here
09:12 - and then you can see me on this website
09:15 - there we go
09:15 - we're right there see we're back yes
09:17 - we're back okay so we're gonna do now
09:19 - we're gonna do something that was
09:20 - inspired by an experience i had when i
09:22 - was still teaching
09:23 - and so when i was still teaching at the
09:24 - high school classroom we had a student
09:26 - enroll a couple of years ago
09:28 - and she was a deaf student and when she
09:30 - enrolled a lot of the students in our
09:32 - community started to realize
09:33 - there were some accessibility problems
09:35 - in our
09:36 - in terms of this person participating in
09:38 - high school and engaging in high school
09:40 - and being able to get the education they
09:42 - deserved and we started to realize that
09:44 - there's a lot of things about
09:46 - our environment that wasn't very
09:47 - inclusive to the deaf and hard of
09:49 - hearing community
09:50 - and so what the students did is they
09:52 - made a petition and they rallied the
09:54 - administration and they said hey
09:55 - instead of french and spanish and these
09:58 - other world languages
09:59 - you should offer american sign language
10:01 - too and they listened and they found a
10:03 - teacher
10:04 - and they started a program and now that
10:06 - school has a thriving american sign
10:08 - language program
10:09 - did you know that this is a true story
10:10 - no i didn't i know it's pretty cool
10:12 - right
10:12 - yeah so i was inspired by these students
10:15 - and i was really motivated to try and
10:17 - continue to build an inclusive community
10:19 - for the deaf and hard of hearing
10:21 - and i wanted to make something with ai
10:23 - that could recognize sign language
10:25 - because then i could help communicate
10:27 - with folks in the deaf and hard of
10:29 - hearing community
10:30 - so we're going to do we're going to use
10:33 - american sign language
10:34 - which is these features here and so you
10:37 - can use your hand to form different
10:39 - letters of the alphabet
10:41 - and we're going to spell the three
10:43 - letters e
10:45 - v and a
10:48 - so again we're gonna do e v
10:52 - and a do you know why we're gonna do eva
10:54 - it's my favorite word one of my favorite
10:56 - words why is it one of your favorite
10:57 - words
10:57 - uh your daughter i have a daughter named
10:59 - ava isn't that so cute we're going to
11:01 - teach you if there are any avas out
11:03 - there in the world this is for you
11:04 - same name as my daughter same name as
11:06 - lots of folks out here at code.org
11:08 - we're very excited so if i want to use
11:10 - this website to do that
11:12 - first i need to say i'm going to train
11:14 - this
11:15 - on the letter e oops
11:20 - and then down here i need to let it know
11:21 - i'm going to train on the letter
11:24 - v and then i need to add one more
11:27 - section to let it know i need to train
11:29 - on the letter a
11:33 - oops i misspelled something that's okay
11:34 - we all make mistakes cool
11:36 - eva so the way this works is we have to
11:40 - hold up our hands to represent
11:42 - the letter e so e was like this all
11:44 - right so i'm going to do it first you
11:45 - ready i'm going to use the same let's go
11:46 - ahead okay
11:47 - so i'm going to press and hold record
11:50 - i'm going to move this around a little
11:51 - bit
11:52 - and what's happening is this machine is
11:54 - learning i've given it 99 images
11:57 - all representing the letter e now i need
12:00 - to do the same thing with the letter
12:02 - v and so when this loads up
12:05 - okay are you ready yeah that's my big
12:07 - moment this is your big moment big
12:08 - moment folks all right so you're going
12:09 - to hold up the v
12:10 - you ready v there you go okay now
12:14 - there you go you kind of move it all
12:15 - over the place
12:18 - no not sideways that's your voguing now
12:20 - v for voguing okay there you go
12:22 - that's a good one right there okay great
12:24 - so we're moving in all those different
12:25 - places so it can learn that it's the v
12:27 - that's important and not all the other
12:28 - stuff that's going on
12:30 - now we're going to go down here to a and
12:32 - i'll do the a again
12:36 - so as i go to do this here is a
12:39 - and i have my a right over here
12:42 - and i've given it about a hundred images
12:45 - so i made sure that i've given it the
12:47 - same amount of training images i got 99
12:49 - i got 120 i got 99 right here
12:52 - and now that i've trained it on all
12:53 - these images i can press this button
12:55 - and this is when it starts to do the
12:57 - work of training the machine
12:59 - of learning the differences between the
13:01 - e and the v
13:03 - in the a and so as it's going through
13:05 - and doing this
13:07 - i got to stay in this tab and it's going
13:10 - to click through and do these pieces
13:13 - i'm going to try and share my video
13:14 - again oh look at us over here on the
13:15 - side
13:16 - um in preparation for this i reached out
13:19 - to my
13:20 - old high school and i asked the american
13:21 - sign language club there to share some
13:23 - facts about the
13:24 - um deaf and hard of hearing community in
13:26 - asl i want to share some of them with
13:27 - you can i do that
13:28 - right ahead so did you know that
13:31 - 90 of deaf babies are born to hearing
13:35 - parents
13:36 - no i didn't know that either until they
13:38 - told me i was going to share some more i
13:40 - have a couple more that i'll share in a
13:41 - little bit but right now
13:43 - i want to go back to this and i want to
13:46 - test out this model that got trained
13:49 - so here we are right there okay so you
13:51 - see us here in the middle and then down
13:53 - here we have these predictions of what
13:54 - it's trying to do
13:56 - okay so i'm going to hold up this was e
13:59 - i'm going to do an e right here it's
14:01 - getting a little confused a little
14:04 - confused
14:05 - it keeps thinking that it's an a oh
14:08 - there we go
14:09 - so down here at the bottom it has these
14:10 - little percentages of what it's trying
14:12 - to predict why don't you try your v
14:14 - why don't you hold the v very strongly
14:17 - thinks it's a v you did a much better
14:18 - job of training than i did that probably
14:19 - because you moved it all around the
14:21 - place
14:21 - because i'm older it's because you just
14:23 - have more experience more wisens
14:25 - hopefully hopefully i think so too and
14:27 - then if i do the a
14:28 - out here there we go pretty strongly
14:31 - down here knows that it's an a
14:32 - down here i'm not sure what happened
14:34 - with the v i'm a little sad that the v
14:36 - didn't show maybe i'm like holding it
14:38 - the wrong way
14:39 - oh no well the e oh wait hold on come
14:41 - back into the picture a little bit
14:42 - because you were like oh see that makes
14:44 - a difference
14:45 - because it's learned that you're in the
14:46 - picture when i do the e and the v
14:48 - and the a i have a lot of troubles with
14:50 - some people
14:51 - um even though this is kind of a silly
14:53 - example where i can't tell the
14:54 - difference between an e and a v
14:55 - and an a sometimes artificial
14:57 - intelligence is used in things like
14:58 - facial recognition
14:59 - where telling the difference between one
15:01 - person or another
15:02 - it's not as silly as just these asl
15:04 - letters it can mean the difference for
15:06 - someone it can be very impactful
15:08 - for the people when it doesn't work as
15:10 - expected so we always want to be careful
15:12 - when we're doing things with artificial
15:14 - intelligence and things like image
15:15 - recognition
15:16 - to make sure we get the most accurate
15:18 - models possible
15:19 - when you follow along at home there's a
15:21 - couple of extra cool steps that you can
15:23 - do to make sure that you can share this
15:25 - out
15:25 - if you decide to make an app that uses
15:28 - eva
15:29 - or you decide to train on other asl
15:31 - symbols once you've done that you can go
15:33 - into this menu
15:34 - and click upload my model
15:38 - and when you do that it'll take a second
15:40 - but then you'll get this
15:41 - link here and when you get this link
15:44 - here
15:44 - one thing that you can do is you can
15:46 - copy and paste it
15:48 - into a new window and you'll get this
15:52 - other website that you can send to your
15:55 - friends and your family and you can use
15:57 - out in the world
15:59 - that has your same trained model in it
16:01 - down here
16:02 - so then if i wanted to there's your v
16:04 - why don't i try a it was over here a is
16:06 - working
16:07 - i don't know what happened with e oh
16:08 - wait e's a little bit i didn't maybe
16:10 - it's because like you know what it is i
16:12 - blame these guys that must be what it is
16:14 - ai isn't always perfect another cool
16:17 - thing that you can do with this same
16:18 - model as well
16:20 - is you can use a website called p5js
16:24 - and if you've done things with web
16:26 - design or web editing
16:28 - this is a way that you can import your
16:29 - model into this other website
16:32 - we can click on that top one there and
16:35 - if i press this play button right here
16:38 - it loads a website that i can also share
16:40 - with people
16:41 - that will also use our machine learning
16:44 - model
16:44 - you see how down here it says daytime
16:47 - yeah
16:47 - it's not what i want because it's using
16:49 - someone else's machine learning model
16:51 - so instead i'm going to go in here and
16:54 - i'm going to copy
16:55 - this line of code that has my model with
16:58 - it
16:59 - and i'm going to paste it right here
17:02 - instead
17:04 - and i'm gonna paste oh i lost paste
17:07 - where's paste
17:08 - i'll just use my keyboard for it instead
17:13 - and then i'm gonna stop and refresh the
17:16 - page
17:18 - and now if we did it correctly see
17:20 - letter v
17:21 - letter v then i'm gonna hold up the a
17:23 - letter a
17:25 - so if you were to do other sort of hour
17:27 - of code tutorials involving websites or
17:29 - things like that
17:30 - you can then build more out of this as
17:32 - well
17:33 - so cool we made an artificial
17:36 - intelligence machine learning model
17:38 - brave for ava um at this point
17:41 - actually i think what i'm going to do
17:42 - now is i'm going to jump ahead
17:45 - to this website i'm going to stop
17:48 - sharing my screen so that you all can
17:50 - see me
17:51 - on the big window here oops
17:55 - i didn't mean to do that i'm going to
17:56 - have to go back to the screen that i was
17:58 - at before
17:58 - there we go um one of the things that
18:01 - we're about to do now is we were going
18:02 - to have ava join us
18:04 - um but ava is asleep so you don't get to
18:06 - meet my baby
18:07 - i know so that's very sad we weren't
18:08 - going to wake her up just for code bites
18:10 - um but we were going to have her come
18:12 - and join us as well
18:14 - but in the meantime we have honored
18:16 - ava's memory
18:17 - and made her letters here if you wanted
18:20 - to look up other american sign language
18:22 - symbols and make your own app around it
18:24 - you can totally do that that just about
18:27 - wraps up our code byte episode so
18:28 - hopefully now you know a little bit more
18:30 - about artificial intelligence and the
18:31 - machine learning process
18:33 - where we gather data we train a model we
18:35 - test it out
18:36 - and if we had more time i would go back
18:38 - and retrain it because
18:40 - oh boy that e still isn't going very
18:42 - well do you learn some things about
18:43 - artificial intelligence
18:45 - i think so yeah what's like what's like
18:47 - your takeaway you're like your five word
18:48 - summary
18:50 - my five word summary sure oh gosh
18:54 - um um
18:58 - you're less than 10 words and that's in
19:00 - some word summary but you wanted a quick
19:01 - answer i don't know if i have a quick
19:02 - answer i'll come back to you
19:03 - okay um i want to share with you
19:06 - if you would like to learn more about
19:09 - artificial intelligence
19:10 - we've got this really awesome panel
19:12 - coming up
19:13 - that you can participate in tomorrow as
19:16 - well
19:16 - i've got a website for you that you can
19:19 - check out
19:20 - it's code.org slash ai and we have
19:24 - this ethics of ai panel that's happening
19:26 - tomorrow
19:27 - that you can participate in and so when
19:30 - you go to that website code.org
19:32 - ai you can see this ai for oceans you
19:34 - can learn more about that and help train
19:36 - the fish
19:37 - you can learn more about what's
19:38 - happening behind the scenes with this
19:39 - how ai works
19:41 - and we've got this awesome exploring the
19:43 - ethics of ai panel
19:44 - that happens tomorrow at 10 30 pacific
19:47 - and i think it's 1
19:48 - 30 eastern those are about those times
19:51 - which is pretty cool
19:53 - all right do you have your do you have
19:54 - your do you have your thoughts around
19:56 - artificial intelligence
19:58 - [Laughter]
20:00 - no i want to say that i'm suffering from
20:02 - a 72 year old
20:05 - sense of memory and uh you'd have to
20:08 - repeat the question again
20:09 - well hopefully advances in artificial
20:11 - intelligence can help with things like
20:13 - memory like those are some of the things
20:14 - that they're doing yeah definitely
20:15 - definitely i would need that
20:16 - you need like a little ai um you need a
20:19 - little ai
20:21 - assistant or something right right right
20:24 - well
20:24 - i am going to close out of these things
20:26 - really enjoyed my time with you all
20:28 - thank you all for coming
20:29 - go make some artificial intelligence
20:32 - machine learning
20:32 - apps go use them to improve the world
20:35 - around us and be careful with the data
20:37 - that you use
20:38 - thank you all so much
20:47 - what happened to the people who raised
20:48 - their hands
