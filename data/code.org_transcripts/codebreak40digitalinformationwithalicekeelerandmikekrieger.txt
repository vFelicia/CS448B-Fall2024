01:36 - hi everybody and welcome to code break
01:39 - we're all here together and together
01:40 - we're hoping to build the world's
01:42 - largest live interactive classroom
01:44 - last week we had thousands of viewers
01:46 - between zoom and facebook uh all
01:48 - together we had almost 15 000 people
01:50 - joining us at and we're hoping to build
01:53 - a larger and larger audience each time
01:56 - so as you join if you enjoy what we do
01:58 - on code break please invite other
02:00 - families other students friends to join
02:02 - us as well
02:03 - i'm here at
02:04 - org headquarters and just kidding i'm
02:07 - here in my living room because nobody's
02:09 - going to their headquarters and i'm
02:11 - joined by my daughter in sidekick sophia
02:14 - hello
02:19 - sophia's going to manage our sounds as
02:21 - as we go along and today we have two
02:23 - very special guests uh
02:25 - the first i want to introduce is alice
02:27 - keeler
02:28 - alice
02:31 - and is mike krieger on already hello
02:34 - hi mike how are you doing doing great
02:37 - so mike is one of the two co-founders of
02:39 - instagram how are you today been really
02:41 - well thank you good to be here
02:43 - where are you joining us from from
02:45 - california from stinson beach
02:47 - since beach california um
02:49 - and uh any thoughts you want to share
02:51 - with all the students who are at home
02:52 - while school is closed well i'm very
02:55 - excited to be here with all of you um
02:57 - it's really inspiring to see this many
02:59 - folks interested in
03:01 - learning more on how to code i'm excited
03:02 - for the the lesson we have ahead uh i
03:05 - think we'll have some some fun doing
03:06 - doing the the exercise and yeah i think
03:09 - it's a
03:10 - i think back to when i was learning to
03:12 - code i was born and raised in brazil so
03:15 - imagine me in brazil with a book that's
03:18 - all i had at the time there was no real
03:19 - you know internet access to coding
03:21 - classes and to go from that to now being
03:23 - able to
03:25 - meet other people who are also
03:26 - interested in the same thing and have
03:28 - all the the classes online i think is is
03:31 - really an interesting opportunity for
03:32 - people to to pursue their curiosity
03:36 - all right so we'll be thank you
03:38 - and yeah it's been a major difference
03:39 - when i started learning as well when i
03:41 - was i started when i was nine years old
03:43 - in tehran iran
03:45 - very very different experience than now
03:47 - um
03:48 - so mike we're going to be building an
03:49 - app uh in the second half of the show
03:51 - but i want to switch to talking with
03:52 - alice briefly alice how are you doing
03:56 - hey i'm good it is beautiful weather out
03:58 - here in california
04:00 - so both of you are in from california
04:03 - um and alice is a superstar teacher who
04:06 - uses technology in her classroom can you
04:08 - tell us a little bit more about uh they
04:10 - see the work that you do
04:11 - absolutely i started teaching math in
04:14 - 1999 i have a degree in math and i
04:17 - inherited the laptop algebra program so
04:20 - my whole teaching career has been
04:22 - helping kids learn math using computers
04:25 - and i've also written some books for
04:27 - teachers
04:28 - i wanna have five kids
04:31 - you have five kids that's wonderful um
04:33 - so i'm like with everybody else i'm home
04:35 - with my family and my daughter sophia
04:37 - joins us every week um partly to learn
04:40 - herself uh partly to keep me in check um
04:43 - and she also has her app to make sound
04:45 - effects so she's my daughter student
04:47 - co-host and also part of the production
04:49 - crew and we're going to start
04:50 - today with the computer joke of the day
04:53 - so sophia you want to ask the computer
04:55 - joke question
04:56 - why was the computer late for work
04:59 - all right mike alice any ideas
05:02 - i got nothing
05:04 - [Music]
05:05 - because it had a hard drive
05:15 - my daughter's wanting to drive right now
05:17 - and believe me it's hard
05:19 - sophia is not happy about having to tell
05:21 - these bad jokes um let's get a chance to
05:24 - meet our our audience we have dozens of
05:26 - students on camera so uh we've switched
05:28 - to gallery view so if everybody could
05:30 - wave and say hello
05:40 - [Music]
05:44 - there's a whole audience that's also
05:46 - joining us from that's not on camera and
05:48 - i want to switch to screen share to see
05:50 - where these folks are from so i'm going
05:52 - to share my screen
05:54 - to
05:55 - we did a geographic poll as people were
05:57 - joining
05:59 - that
06:00 - other people in california with us
06:02 - yeah
06:03 - some uk
06:04 - wow folks looks like all the way over in
06:07 - india and maybe parts of china and
06:09 - thailand
06:11 - antarctica
06:13 - good coding cutting uh opportunities
06:15 - there
06:16 - yeah
06:21 - so besides saying i mean by the way it's
06:23 - crazy that there's people in china in in
06:25 - eastern china or in hawaii i'm not sure
06:28 - what time zone in hawaii it's i think 7
06:30 - a.m
06:31 - in china it's well after midnight i
06:33 - believe
06:34 - let's also to learn more about the
06:36 - audience i want to get a sense of what
06:37 - grade people are in so if we could put
06:39 - up an audience poll for people to enter
06:40 - their grade band
06:42 - so we get a sense of the different age
06:44 - groups so whether it's in the elementary
06:47 - school high school
06:49 - it's kind of like it was first all out
06:50 - high schoolers we've got a lot of third
06:52 - and fifth grade students joining us
06:54 - today which i have a fourth grader
06:57 - awesome
07:00 - kinder
07:01 - all age groups
07:02 - yeah everybody you share the polls
07:04 - everybody can see them
07:06 - all right so our biggest group is third
07:09 - fourth and fifth graders but we have a
07:10 - little bit of a spread from all over now
07:12 - no matter what group you're in it's
07:14 - never too late to learn computer science
07:15 - so even if
07:17 - or too early
07:20 - whether you're in your 70s and joining
07:22 - us or whether you're a beginner
07:24 - or whether you're younger there's
07:25 - different skill levels so let's do
07:26 - another poll just get a sense of the
07:27 - different skill levels of people whether
07:30 - you're a beginner intermediate or
07:31 - advanced
07:33 - and if everybody could just submit
07:35 - so we get a sense of that intermediate
07:36 - users
07:38 - got some pressure
07:41 - good
07:42 - it's my first zoom pole it's very cool
07:44 - to see the votes come in live
07:46 - yeah this is similar to most zoo
07:48 - meetings but the the audience that's in
07:49 - the background that we have to do extra
07:51 - work to make sure they they get a sense
07:53 - a chance to interact as well if we could
07:55 - share these results on screen as well um
07:57 - it's not intermediate it's across
08:00 - all
08:01 - across the range and i want to say for
08:03 - the folks who are beginners we're going
08:05 - to start at beginner level stuff and get
08:08 - more advanced please stick with us even
08:10 - if things go a little bit over your head
08:11 - or more than what you're used to
08:12 - learning
08:13 - you'll always be able to
08:15 - keep up with something and if you're
08:17 - more advanced uh we'll try to make it
08:19 - interesting even at the early parts of
08:20 - the episode uh and by the later parts
08:22 - we'll be doing some fun stuff one of the
08:24 - most exciting parts is we're gonna be
08:25 - recreating one of the features of
08:26 - instagram live and code uh with the
08:29 - co-founder of instagram which should be
08:30 - pretty interesting
08:32 - as we're going along if you're in the
08:34 - audience that isn't on camera you can at
08:36 - any point to ask a question by clicking
08:38 - the q a button if you're on a touch
08:40 - screen you may need to tap the screen to
08:42 - see this button show up the team at
08:44 - code.org is going to be answering
08:45 - questions live so at any point if you're
08:47 - whether it's a question about this
08:49 - episode or just a generic computer
08:51 - science question feel free to use that
08:54 - and we'll take some of the best
08:55 - questions to ask of either mike or alice
08:57 - or myself uh in the middle at the end of
08:59 - the show
09:00 - we have three parts to today's episode
09:03 - uh we're gonna start by learning about
09:05 - images and pixels as part of learning
09:07 - about digital information then we're
09:08 - going to learn about color pixels and
09:10 - then we're going to build a feature of
09:12 - instagram ourselves live
09:15 - and as we go we may have
09:17 - bugs that happen and we're going to
09:19 - learn about a computer science concept
09:20 - called debugging this is our fourth time
09:22 - doing this so there may always be
09:23 - problems um
09:25 - sophia's got a little bug that she's
09:27 - painted so if we run into technical
09:29 - issues as we are sure to do we'll debug
09:31 - them and figure them out on the fly so
09:33 - please please be patient with us before
09:36 - we go into the today's lesson on digital
09:38 - information one thing i want to do is i
09:39 - want to welcome students to demo their
09:42 - creations so last week we learned about
09:44 - encryptions and secret messages and each
09:47 - week when you share your creations we're
09:48 - going to invite some of the best ones on
09:50 - next week's episode uh so this week we
09:53 - want to invite
09:54 - anna anna are you there with us
09:57 - yeah i'm here hi
09:59 - hi there anna so last week we learned
10:00 - about making a password generator
10:03 - and anna submitted the coolest
10:05 - more advanced password generator of all
10:06 - the students participating um so i'm
10:09 - gonna screen share to show but you can
10:10 - say hi to
10:12 - to mike and alice while i turn on my
10:13 - screen share to show your app
10:15 - and i'm excited to see this thanks
10:19 - anna where are you calling from
10:22 - rochester new york rochester new york so
10:24 - this is anna's
10:26 - password generator so you can choose how
10:28 - many words you want
10:29 - in a password
10:31 - and if i click
10:33 - you know this is a three word password
10:35 - so for game near
10:37 - uh you can make so anna can you walk me
10:39 - through one of the features that you
10:40 - added to this to make it more
10:42 - uh
10:43 - yeah so um one of the things i noticed
10:46 - was that in the original app you could
10:49 - end up with the same word twice in a
10:50 - password so i added a feature to
10:54 - remove that so the default is now you
10:56 - can only have each word once but you can
10:59 - choose to have it more than once and
11:02 - then i also added in
11:04 - number
11:05 - substitutions for some letters so
11:07 - e is substituted with three o and zero
11:10 - and things like that i guess
11:13 - what would this be
11:16 - so yeah that would be
11:18 - oh the one is i so that would be wild
11:20 - tried pure and it says underneath oh no
11:26 - nice how did you get the possible
11:29 - passwords down there
11:31 - um so when you're
11:33 - i used a factorial so when you
11:36 - are reusing the words it's just
11:39 - the exponential um but then when you're
11:42 - not allowing the usable words it was the
11:45 - number of words factorial
11:47 - divided by
11:48 - the number of words in the password
11:49 - factorial
11:52 - all right cool
11:54 - that's pretty cool all right so thank
11:56 - you so much anna um i'm going to stop
11:58 - the screen share for a second uh and i
12:01 - also want to introduce uh
12:03 - students that are basically working in
12:05 - our classrooms doing computer science
12:06 - principles
12:08 - so computer science principles is the
12:10 - most popular high school computer scores
12:12 - in the nation students are learning
12:14 - anything everything from how the
12:15 - internet works to cyber security to
12:17 - learning how to program and build your
12:19 - own app and in the programming units one
12:21 - of the things that these cs principal
12:23 - students are learning is how to use
12:24 - coding to create complex scenes and
12:27 - we've done this before with the code.org
12:29 - artist tool but what the high school
12:30 - students are doing are making much more
12:32 - complicated scenes and we ask high
12:34 - school students from all around the
12:35 - country to submit their creations uh
12:38 - there were a lot of really good ones so
12:39 - it was hard to choose
12:41 - the ones to highlight but i'll i'll
12:43 - quickly screen share to show some
12:45 - examples of these
12:48 - so what you see here is basically
12:50 - at
12:51 - five different creations
12:53 - uh this rainbow here with uh and then
12:56 - this sort of
12:57 - thing
12:59 - and then this uh these hot air balloons
13:01 - in the city these are all from different
13:03 - students around the country and these
13:04 - may look like drawings you could make
13:06 - with a pen or or so on but in every one
13:08 - of these cases they're using computer
13:10 - programming commands like the rainbows
13:12 - are parts of a circle or the little
13:14 - cactuses have little lines or so on
13:18 - the one i want to go into more is this
13:20 - one that kira made so cara's gonna join
13:22 - us uh cara are you there have we unmuted
13:24 - you yet yeah i'm right here
13:26 - all right so this is patient
13:29 - where are you from
13:31 - i live in rockville maryland
13:34 - awesome
13:35 - i'm going to reload this so we can see
13:37 - that looks nice outside there
13:40 - yeah sun's shining
13:44 - so this is the the drawing that your
13:46 - code makes if we look at the actual code
13:48 - for this uh there's quite a lot going on
13:52 - all those for loops many hundreds of
13:54 - lines of code but one thing i was
13:56 - looking through your code i noticed
13:57 - basically these are this right here is
13:58 - the code to draw the stars
14:00 - and 300 stars each at a random location
14:04 - and some
14:06 - of width 0.3 and then you draw some you
14:08 - draw some bigger stars and then some
14:10 - straw smaller stars at which with 0.2 um
14:14 - and then even smaller stars so as the
14:16 - code runs as a whole sort of
14:18 - different levels of stars being drawn
14:22 - so each time you run this code you
14:24 - basically see a different night sky
14:25 - because the positions and locations of
14:26 - the stars or buildings are randomized
14:28 - which is kind of cool i really like the
14:30 - comet getting thicker as it goes along
14:32 - too
14:34 - so thank you i think that was definitely
14:35 - the most complicated part because i
14:37 - ended up using circles with radii that
14:40 - were increasing incrementally and it was
14:42 - very difficult to get the position so
14:44 - that it was like arced the way that it
14:46 - does so i think that was definitely the
14:48 - most labor-intensive part of the code
14:50 - but it's also the most satisfying to see
14:52 - when you run it again and again yeah it
14:55 - looks very cool
14:56 - totally i'm just noticing how many of
14:58 - these functions you have with the
14:59 - positions i'm thinking that had to take
15:01 - in a really long time to figure out
15:03 - where all of the
15:04 - numbers are the between
15:06 - yeah it was a lot of trial and error for
15:08 - sure but
15:09 - eventually you kind of noticed patterns
15:11 - with how far you need to move as you
15:13 - increase the radii and you decrease the
15:15 - distance between the points
15:17 - so it got faster as i worked more and
15:19 - more
15:20 - awesome
15:22 - all right well thank you so much kyra
15:24 - and hope you're doing well in maryland
15:26 - uh
15:27 - so today's episode what we're going to
15:29 - learn about is digital information so
15:32 - our
15:32 - special word of the day where is my
15:34 - special word of the day is two words of
15:36 - the day there are two words is digital
15:39 - information and if you notice i colored
15:41 - the eyes and the o's differently because
15:43 - digital information is stored in ones
15:45 - and zeros computers use ones and zeros
15:48 - to represent information
15:50 - and we're going to learn today about
15:52 - three different things and we're going
15:53 - to start with images and pixels
15:56 - so ones and zeros can be used to
15:57 - represent numbers and there's a bunch of
15:59 - math that goes behind that they can be
16:00 - used to represent letters colors sounds
16:04 - but today what we're going to learn
16:06 - about is how ones and zeros are used to
16:08 - represent images and and photos
16:12 - now
16:13 - if you look at the ones and zeros you
16:15 - don't need to think about the math just
16:16 - think about the ones and zeros as lights
16:18 - if you look at the monitor on your
16:20 - screen every little dot on your screen
16:22 - is effectively a light
16:24 - and it can be on or off and in fact the
16:26 - reason we use ones and zeros is because
16:28 - the electricity in a computer can be on
16:30 - or off like a light bulb so when it's a
16:31 - one it's on
16:33 - when it's a zero it's off and so
16:36 - inside a computer there's wires and
16:39 - basically the ones and zeros turn those
16:41 - wires
16:42 - on to have voltage are off to not have
16:44 - voltage that's also what's happening on
16:46 - the screen of your computer as well
16:48 - so every little dot on your screen
16:50 - can be on or off and in fact if it was a
16:52 - purely black and white screen all we
16:54 - would need is ones and zeros to
16:56 - represent what's going on there and so
16:58 - what we're going to do is a funky little
16:59 - exercise where the actual students on
17:01 - camera are themselves going to be
17:04 - individual pixels
17:06 - as part of an image at this is something
17:09 - we've never tried before and it's a
17:10 - setup that's kind of funky so we're
17:12 - going to switch into a gallery view
17:14 - where we see
17:16 - 20 or so of us all on camera all at the
17:18 - same time
17:20 - uh this is going to take a little bit of
17:21 - setup to do because different screens
17:23 - that students are going to be on whether
17:24 - you're on a mobile phone or so on might
17:26 - be slightly different
17:27 - and we have a funky set up to try to get
17:30 - everybody basically to see the same 20
17:33 - students all at once
17:36 - so right now we all see the same screen
17:38 - of 20 students whether you're on a
17:40 - mobile phone whether you're on an ipad
17:41 - etc um
17:43 - just so you know how we're doing this is
17:45 - pretty
17:46 - complicated what what's happening behind
17:48 - the scenes is there's somebody who's
17:50 - using a phone to capture a picture of
17:52 - zoom and then streaming back from that
17:54 - phone back into zoom so we see all the
17:56 - same things um so what we're gonna do
17:59 - everybody on camera uh do you all have a
18:01 - piece of paper like a white piece of
18:03 - paper
18:05 - and can you hold up your white piece of
18:07 - paper
18:08 - so when you hold up your white piece of
18:10 - paper this is like you're holding a one
18:13 - it's like there's a
18:14 - light on your screen and the light is on
18:17 - and we have everybody holding that piece
18:19 - of paper up
18:20 - except i think sophia we don't see yours
18:23 - in akira we don't see yours
18:25 - right so that's everybody holding up a
18:28 - one now let's turn off our pieces of
18:30 - paper and everybody hold the zero which
18:32 - take your pieces of paper down so
18:34 - uh now what i want to do which we
18:36 - haven't really practiced or tried before
18:38 - but what we want to do is try to spell
18:40 - something
18:41 - so let's try to spell a c
18:44 - uh so depending on where you are on the
18:46 - screen
18:47 - see if you want we want to spell a
18:48 - letter c
18:50 - along the top and sides yeah along the
18:52 - top
18:54 - and then the left side but the middle
18:55 - shouldn't so ryan drop your piece of
18:58 - paper because you're
19:02 - sophia you should hold up a piece of
19:03 - paper
19:06 - rise on can you hold up your piece of
19:08 - paper
19:13 - and jj if you could drop yours
19:18 - if you hold yours closer up there there
19:20 - you go this is kind of a letter
19:22 - c and you can imagine this letter c if
19:26 - this was a screen some of the some of
19:27 - the dots in the screen are white some of
19:29 - them are black and whether they're white
19:30 - or black depends on whether they're ones
19:32 - or zeros
19:34 - let's see if we can make a letter o
19:36 - so the folks on the right side can you
19:38 - hold up your pieces of paper too and
19:39 - everybody else who was in the sea keep
19:41 - it up still
19:43 - so sasha
19:45 - patrick
19:46 - caleb put yours down jj
19:50 - there we go so depending on whether we
19:53 - have these pieces of paper up or down uh
19:55 - basically we can show different things
19:57 - on the screen so
19:59 - one thing we want to do is basically now
20:01 - try
20:02 - sending a pattern
20:03 - of ones and zeros to everybody who's on
20:05 - the screen so that we're gonna
20:07 - we're gonna copy and paste into the chat
20:09 - room a pattern of ones and zeroes so uh
20:13 - hannah if you're in the background there
20:14 - can you can you all if you look at the
20:16 - chat there's a bunch of ones and zeros
20:18 - for different people in the first row to
20:20 - hold a one then a zero then a one then a
20:23 - zero in the second row to hold a zero
20:25 - then a one then a zero then a one don't
20:27 - hold it up yet what i wanna do is have a
20:30 - poll of the audience who's not on the
20:31 - screen if you can look in the chat the
20:34 - code for what's going to be displayed is
20:35 - one zero one zero zero one zero one one
20:38 - zero one zero zero one zero one one zero
20:41 - one zero and the question is what is
20:44 - what is the pattern that this is gonna
20:46 - create
20:46 - so if we do a poll of the whole audience
20:50 - is it going to be a smiley face or a
20:51 - flower or a star
20:54 - or a checkerboard
20:56 - let's see the audience guesses we have a
20:58 - whole bunch of different guests people
20:59 - get different things
21:02 - you're not sure about the code you can
21:04 - click on the chats to see the different
21:06 - options
21:07 - all right
21:08 - uh
21:10 - about half the audience has already
21:11 - voted and the guesses are all over the
21:14 - map but i think a lot of the students
21:15 - have figured it out but not everybody
21:17 - has figured it out um can we share the
21:19 - poll results
21:22 - look at that checkerboard
21:24 - checkerboard actually we should have
21:25 - done it with your results can you hide
21:27 - the poll results
21:29 - and let's basically if you're in the if
21:31 - you're on the people on screen you see
21:33 - from your row what you should be doing
21:35 - uh
21:38 - so if you um so in the first row
21:40 - basically find your name in that row
21:43 - and then hold up your one or the zero
21:45 - depending on what you are or whether
21:47 - it's a one or a zero
21:49 - and i'm going to paste these values in
21:51 - the chat window again
21:56 - there we go
22:00 - so we sort of see a checkerboard
22:05 - we're almost at checkerboard i think
22:06 - rosie
22:08 - somebody's got some ones or zeros off
22:10 - but anyway so that's about as close as
22:13 - we can get to doing pixel photography
22:15 - with people on a zoom call uh and if you
22:17 - share the poll results again basically
22:19 - the audience guessed it that the the
22:21 - pattern of ones and zeros makes a
22:22 - checkerboard but it would have been
22:24 - really cool if we could have had a
22:26 - flower or star um so that was
22:29 - basically how ones and zeros can be used
22:30 - to represent digital photography um and
22:34 - we learned now how a bit of a one or
22:35 - zero can represent
22:37 - basically black or white but you know
22:40 - most pictures are not black or white so
22:41 - let's talk about how we can use pixels
22:43 - to represent color
22:46 - and we're going to basically do this
22:47 - with
22:48 - with i'm going to show a slide
22:50 - presentation about how this works but
22:52 - alice do you alice or mike do you have
22:53 - any ideas about how we can represent
22:55 - colors using just zeros and ones
22:58 - well sometimes if you if you go i don't
23:00 - know if it works on these computers but
23:01 - when you go old-school computers you got
23:03 - really really close you would see that
23:05 - there was actually not just one little
23:07 - dot uh on every little row but actually
23:10 - three little dots on every little row
23:12 - yes
23:13 - since i like to do html i'm guessing it
23:16 - has to do with the rgb color code which
23:19 - i never fully knew what that was but i
23:22 - use it
23:23 - so that's what we're gonna learn right
23:24 - now so this is actually a
23:26 - zoom in of an old school monitor on old
23:31 - school computers if you got close enough
23:32 - with a magnifying glass you'd actually
23:34 - see little lights for red green and blue
23:37 - so even though the colors on the screen
23:38 - might be white or gray
23:40 - each of the little dots on the screen
23:42 - had three little lights
23:44 - and each one of these lights
23:47 - can have information storing what color
23:49 - or how bright that light is now if you
23:51 - had only one
23:53 - uh bit of information a zero or one for
23:56 - each light you could have the red be a
23:58 - one
23:59 - and what you'd see in that dot is all
24:01 - red or if the blue is a one you'd see
24:04 - all blue or if the green is the one
24:06 - you'd see all green
24:08 - what would happen to your favorite
24:10 - yeah
24:10 - but what would happen if two of these
24:12 - were a one you'd get them mixed like red
24:15 - and green together is yellow is that
24:17 - what you've learned in school too sophia
24:18 - no no no
24:20 - yeah usually red and green is like this
24:22 - kind of what color would that be brown
24:24 - or mustard or something i mean i've been
24:25 - to art class but it depends on the shade
24:28 - like
24:29 - if it's really a close enough shade it
24:31 - can make yellow yeah the thing is in art
24:34 - class you're mixing paint so when you
24:36 - mix multiple colors it gets darker in
24:39 - computer science you're actually mixing
24:41 - light so when a red and a green light
24:43 - are both on it gets more bright the more
24:45 - lights you have on the more bright it is
24:48 - and red plus blue usually with paint is
24:51 - purple but in computers it becomes pink
24:53 - or
24:54 - blue plus green becomes cyan
24:57 - and what happens if you mix red and blue
24:59 - and green together with paint you just
25:01 - get mud
25:03 - but with light
25:04 - you get perfectly white
25:06 - whiteness so when all the lights are on
25:09 - it's white and when all of them are off
25:11 - it's black so with three bits of
25:13 - information
25:14 - red blue and green you can represent
25:17 - four colors based on whether they're all
25:19 - zero or one just one of them is on and
25:22 - then if you have the mixtures you can
25:24 - have multiple different colors on
25:27 - so what we're going to do for the entire
25:28 - audience is we're going to give you a
25:30 - chance to each come up with your own
25:31 - pixel and submit it into a shared screen
25:35 - where we're all going to see the pixels
25:36 - people suggest so basically if you could
25:39 - go to this url bit dot lee code
25:41 - codepixel
25:42 - or if you have a phone
25:44 - use the phone's camera to scan this qr
25:46 - code over here
25:49 - what's going to happen when you do that
25:51 - is what you do when you click that url
25:53 - is going to see a google form and inside
25:56 - this google form basically what you're
25:57 - going to see is
26:01 - you can submit your name and you can
26:03 - submit three individual pixels your red
26:06 - value your green value and your blue
26:09 - value and we'll actually see all the
26:11 - values that people submit from all
26:12 - around the uh all around the world
26:15 - and then what we're going to do is we
26:16 - have a spreadsheet that's going to
26:18 - actually combine these so that each one
26:20 - of the pixels individually gets
26:21 - converted into colors
26:25 - and then we're actually going to lay
26:26 - them out
26:27 - like the dots on a screen on a computer
26:29 - screen to actually make a picture that's
26:31 - combining all the pixel pixels submitted
26:33 - from students all around the country
26:36 - now i'm going to stop my screen share
26:38 - briefly
26:39 - as we do this and switch to show a
26:41 - spreadsheet that actually does this
26:43 - as people are submitting their values
26:45 - wait dad your shirt it's like pixels
26:49 - yes that's pretty funny when i was
26:50 - getting dressed this morning sophia knew
26:52 - that we were going to talk about pixels
26:54 - today so that's how we decided what to
26:56 - wear today
27:01 - so we have that spreadsheet that people
27:03 - submitted their information to
27:07 - about google forms is that it's so easy
27:09 - to get information from a lot of people
27:11 - all into one place quickly
27:15 - so i'm going to switch to my google
27:16 - spreadsheet i'm a little worried because
27:18 - this spreadsheet has had so many people
27:20 - submitting to it all at the same time
27:22 - that i'm not sure if it's even going to
27:23 - work but
27:26 - it doesn't it's a bug but
27:28 - if it doesn't it's a bug we'll find out
27:30 - it's it won't actually be a bug it'll
27:32 - just be that my computer is too slow so
27:34 - here's a spreadsheet with people
27:35 - submitting
27:36 - their names
27:38 - and their pixels to it
27:40 - and it's so laggy that i can barely even
27:42 - load it in time
27:44 - but you can see pixels gradually coming
27:46 - in as students are submitting that your
27:48 - individual pixels whoa look at all that
27:51 - that's so cool
27:52 - so those are all the ones and zeros that
27:54 - everybody submitted from all around the
27:56 - world and what we've done is we've added
27:58 - conditional formatting which is a
27:59 - feature in excel so each person is
28:02 - submitted when you get a zero one one or
28:04 - a one one one and it's making one big
28:06 - monitor and by the way we haven't tested
28:08 - this before because we didn't have a
28:10 - thousand students to try this so i'm
28:12 - very happy that it actually worked
28:15 - i can scroll down there's more yeah
28:17 - there's a lot of
28:19 - pixels coming in as people are
28:21 - submitting us
28:22 - isn't it fun when you build something
28:24 - and it works on the very first try
28:27 - that never
28:28 - happens
28:30 - yeah exactly um one thing that's cool
28:32 - here is the black ones you can't see the
28:35 - numbers there but those are zero zero
28:36 - zero uh alice can you tell me how i
28:39 - could actually see the zero zero zeros
28:41 - there
28:42 - that's actually the fun so if you go in
28:44 - and change the font color to white so i
28:46 - like to use the conditional formatting
28:48 - where i set the font color
28:50 - and the
28:52 - fill color to be the same so i wouldn't
28:54 - see the numbers but in this case because
28:56 - we do
28:57 - i would set a contrasting color so yeah
29:00 - depending on what's in the cell
29:03 - what color to make it so it says if the
29:05 - cell contains zero zero zero
29:07 - it colors it black and i can say if it's
29:10 - zero zero zero i'll change the font to
29:12 - be white
29:13 - and i say done
29:16 - now we should see all the black ones you
29:18 - should see the zeros show up in them
29:20 - but of course
29:22 - because there's so many cells being
29:23 - calculated all at once
29:26 - yeah it's calculated i have a
29:27 - spreadsheet so much of this which i did
29:29 - all minecraft style and the same thing
29:31 - it takes a little bit for it to upload
29:33 - but there it goes all right well that
29:35 - was pretty cool everybody got to submit
29:36 - their own pixel and we all made a
29:38 - beautiful photo of i don't know what
29:41 - it's like it's just as hard to recognize
29:43 - as our checkerboard or
29:45 - see but but what you realize is how
29:47 - these little digital pieces of
29:48 - information can be used to create
29:50 - a photo on the screen
29:52 - and if you now look at your screen and
29:54 - you see my face or you see alice or mike
29:56 - every time you look at a computer screen
29:58 - like if you look at the green behind
30:00 - alice uh alice can you talk so we can
30:02 - see the green oh yeah
30:04 - this is my uh my wall at my house
30:07 - every little dot on that screen that's
30:08 - green is because there's enough ones to
30:11 - turn on the green lights on her monitor
30:14 - to be on and the red lights and the blue
30:16 - lights are zeros to be off
30:18 - every single time you see a photo on
30:20 - instagram there's a whole bunch of ones
30:22 - and zeros turning on little lights
30:24 - there's literally more than a million
30:27 - dots on the screen so more than 10
30:30 - million ones and zeros coloring every
30:32 - single
30:33 - image and when there's a video happening
30:35 - at 30 frames a second billions of times
30:38 - little ones and zeros are turning on and
30:39 - off lights on your monitor to actually
30:42 - change what's what you see on the screen
30:44 - it's kind of crazy that there's billions
30:46 - per second of changes in ones and zeros
30:48 - to turn on lights but that's basically
30:50 - how all computer videos and and computer
30:53 - photos are displayed
30:56 - um
30:58 - alice can you tell us about how else
30:59 - you've used maybe basically technology
31:01 - like this in classrooms for teaching
31:04 - yeah absolutely i even use something
31:05 - very similar to this with pixel art
31:08 - because i love pixels and when you make
31:10 - a google drawing and you go into resize
31:12 - it i always like to reset it to pixel
31:14 - sizes because that's the width of your
31:16 - screen so pixels are a great way for
31:18 - students to create and be
31:20 - um show what their learning is in a more
31:22 - fun way so i use alaska.com pixel art
31:26 - which allows them to select
31:28 - uh with numbers they just like pink by
31:30 - number and i every day i have students
31:33 - sending me what they've been creating
31:35 - because we want students to create and
31:37 - pixels are one way that students can
31:39 - show what they've learned
31:41 - wonderful and in fact in one of the
31:43 - challenge assignments we're going to
31:44 - send to students
31:46 - at the end of this episode includes uh
31:48 - some some work that you could do with a
31:50 - different tool for making pixel arts but
31:51 - it'll be very similar um
31:54 - alice there's a lot of students at home
31:56 - and also teachers as well do you have
31:57 - any message to share with folks who are
31:59 - basically home by themselves studying
32:01 - during this protracted period of who
32:03 - knows how long school is closed yeah
32:05 - that's a great time though to learn
32:07 - something new and you're not set at a
32:10 - bell schedule right now is that you can
32:12 - take some time to say like i want to
32:13 - learn how to code some images in
32:16 - instagram and it takes some time like i
32:19 - don't always get it right the first time
32:21 - so i it's just an opportunity to
32:23 - kind of breathe and have the time to
32:25 - explore things you're excited about
32:28 - thank you so much uh yeah we've been
32:31 - spending a lot of time while we're at
32:32 - home it's our spring break right now in
32:34 - in seattle but sophia has been doing a
32:37 - lot of coding but also a lot of other
32:38 - stuff as well sophia what have you been
32:40 - doing while you've been at home i mean
32:42 - now that i think of it i can't really
32:44 - decide but i've done a lot of arts and
32:46 - crafts a lot of arts and crafts yeah you
32:49 - do any minecraft
32:51 - actually yes actually she's done a
32:54 - little bit of minecraft but we actually
32:56 - i we limit our screen time so we do more
32:58 - coding and creativity when we're on
33:00 - computers and less video games because
33:02 - encode in minecraft i'm just saying
33:05 - minecraft that's true
33:07 - um i want to switch to see if we have
33:10 - any um we have some questions from the
33:12 - audience uh so regan b uh said what is a
33:17 - factorial uh alice do you want to answer
33:20 - that question great question so when you
33:22 - want to multiply the same thing uh say 5
33:26 - factorial so it's 5 times 4 times 3
33:28 - times 2 times 1. so where that comes
33:30 - into play is when you're doing
33:32 - permutations so i have five people and i
33:35 - pick a liter well now i need to take
33:36 - that leader out and now i have four
33:38 - people and i pick the second person so i
33:40 - take that person out and so i'm looking
33:42 - for how many ways i can take these five
33:45 - people and put them in line
33:46 - so you multiply them together
33:48 - is a great practical application for
33:50 - factorials and you would write it as
33:52 - like five
33:53 - with an exclamation mark so in her code
33:56 - each letter has 26 options so 26
34:00 - factorial
34:01 - would give you
34:02 - uh 26 for the first a letter 25 for the
34:06 - second letter just generating up those
34:07 - numbers
34:09 - and then there's a question from molina
34:11 - a teacher in los angeles saying as we
34:13 - all adjusted teaching from whom
34:15 - many of us teachers have directed our
34:16 - students to code break what advice do
34:18 - you have for teachers adjusting to
34:20 - remote learning and bringing their
34:21 - students to today's call or to remote
34:23 - learning in general
34:25 - well my favorite is to be collaborative
34:27 - i mean this is times where we can't be
34:29 - together so looking for
34:31 - tools that allow us to be together so i
34:33 - love everyone on the same spreadsheet or
34:35 - everyone on the same google slides and
34:37 - if you're a microsoft teams user the
34:39 - teams chat is just a great way to
34:41 - interact and focus on ways that we can
34:44 - be together when we can't
34:46 - yeah
34:47 - one thing i also recommend is just
34:48 - spending a little bit of time
34:50 - this these moments aren't just about
34:52 - education but also about a little bit of
34:53 - inspiration and community because
34:55 - everybody's stuck
34:56 - dealing with just their mom or dad or
34:58 - brother or sister and not getting enough
35:00 - time seeing regular people so just a
35:02 - little bit of time to connect and ask
35:04 - how are you doing and how's your day uh
35:07 - can go a long way
35:08 - and it's a good time to recognize that
35:10 - school isn't just about math and reading
35:12 - you can learn all sorts of things like
35:14 - learning to play a new musical
35:15 - instrument reading a book that you
35:17 - thought was too hard to understand
35:19 - there's so many things we can learn
35:20 - during this time
35:22 - um
35:22 - alice thank you so much for joining us
35:24 - we're halfway through this episode and
35:26 - want to go on to the next stage but
35:28 - could we switch to gallery view and have
35:30 - everybody say goodbye to alice and
35:31 - sophia's going to play an applause sound
35:33 - for you
35:37 - hi alice hi thanks for having me
35:40 - all right uh
35:42 - mike thank you for uh sitting through
35:44 - the first half of the show we want to
35:45 - talk now about your work um so you were
35:48 - born in brazil like you mentioned
35:49 - earlier what brought you to the united
35:51 - states yeah so brazilian brazil uh i was
35:54 - there until um i was 18 and um at the
35:58 - time there was not a lot of um
36:00 - computer science and startup sort of uh
36:03 - education in brazil that's really
36:05 - changed now but at the time i was really
36:07 - interested in in programming and and
36:09 - decided to come to the us because at the
36:11 - time that was where
36:12 - you know i could come and learn um so
36:14 - that was the big leap um but it's been
36:17 - exciting actually in the last few years
36:18 - to see
36:19 - so many coding schools and other things
36:22 - appear in brazil a lot of interest from
36:23 - people there too now yeah so you and i
36:27 - are both immigrants and many american
36:29 - entrepreneurs are immigrants but when it
36:31 - comes to technology and computer science
36:33 - you don't see a lot of successful latino
36:35 - americans in tech or in computer science
36:38 - what was it like going through studying
36:39 - computer science at stanford and
36:41 - starting your own company being
36:43 - from south america
36:44 - well i think you know i think role
36:46 - models are really important role models
36:48 - and mentors and one of the things that
36:49 - was hard for me was there weren't just
36:51 - that many other latinos other brazilians
36:54 - who were you know have been doing that
36:56 - so um one thing i try to do now is when
36:58 - there are people in brazil who are
37:00 - trying to start something or trying to
37:02 - learn i'm really excited to help them
37:04 - because i think if you see somebody that
37:06 - you know you know or who has the same
37:07 - background as you do something it's a
37:09 - lot more helpful and it can be inspiring
37:12 - um so i have a question about instagram
37:14 - how did the idea for instagram come
37:16 - about and what was it like creating it
37:18 - in the early days
37:19 - were you what were you doing what like
37:21 - right before that happened uh where were
37:23 - you and your co-founder kevin
37:26 - can you tell us a little bit about the
37:27 - story of the creation of instagram yeah
37:29 - so i was before instagram i was working
37:31 - at a startup called mebo it's not around
37:33 - anymore but it let you basically chat on
37:35 - your computer uh back when like aol
37:37 - instant messenger way before most of
37:40 - your times but you know that was where
37:42 - we were mostly chatting uh before text
37:44 - messaging uh and i was there and i was
37:46 - you know coding and doing some design
37:49 - but then met up with my friend kevin and
37:50 - he was really interested in doing a
37:51 - company
37:52 - and i was too
37:54 - and uh
37:55 - i think you know sometimes people think
37:57 - startups like just happen in like a
37:58 - light bulb but it actually was a lot of
38:01 - sort of trying one thing seeing
38:05 - so we definitely went through a lot of
38:07 - different you know attempts that like
38:09 - should work like this now that doesn't
38:11 - work should it work like that um
38:13 - and so it was a lot of trying things out
38:16 - seeing if they worked it took us almost
38:18 - a year to really get to the idea of
38:20 - instagram but the idea of instagram came
38:22 - from trying a lot of other ideas and
38:24 - kind of narrowing down from there
38:26 - got it and did you expect it to be one
38:28 - of the world's largest social networks
38:30 - in history when you're starting it out
38:32 - not at all we were you know really
38:33 - trying to do something that we thought
38:34 - was cool that we wanted to use and uh
38:37 - you know if you asked me to guess how
38:39 - many people would use it ever maybe i
38:40 - would have said if we're really lucky
38:42 - like a million people will use it um and
38:45 - so it was really amazing to see it grow
38:47 - that's awesome uh yeah similarly when we
38:50 - started code.org in the hour of code we
38:52 - we kicked off the hour of code with the
38:54 - goal of getting 10 million students to
38:56 - do the hour of code in one week and in
38:58 - fact when we said that we're like if we
39:00 - ask for 10 million students we might get
39:02 - 1 million yeah first week we had 20
39:05 - million students uh and we've now in the
39:08 - six years the hour of code has been
39:09 - around we just passed 900 million hours
39:13 - of code being done which has been
39:15 - incredible to say that incredible
39:17 - there's another thing i wanted to ask
39:18 - you because people talk about you know
39:20 - when you see stories or movies about
39:22 - people creating things there's a lot of
39:24 - talk about like the special moment of
39:25 - genius like light bulb moment did you
39:28 - all have a light bulb moment where like
39:30 - everything came together like we're
39:31 - going to create instagram and it's going
39:32 - to have stories and this and that
39:34 - so to us it was a lot more about sort of
39:37 - figuring one thing out and then trying
39:39 - it and then like going to the next one
39:40 - we did have the moment though where uh
39:43 - we named it which was kind of a light
39:44 - bulb moment so uh you know it was just
39:47 - called code name we didn't even it was
39:48 - just you know we didn't have a name for
39:50 - it yet and i remember i mean my
39:51 - co-founder had a uh two like word
39:54 - documents open with a bunch of like
39:56 - starts of words and ends of words so
39:58 - like insta pic like that doesn't sound
40:00 - that good uh you know like cool pick and
40:04 - then all of a sudden we made insta and
40:05 - gram and we're like whoa that that's
40:07 - pretty good so we decided to go with
40:09 - that and it works in portuguese too like
40:11 - instagram and it works in a lot of
40:12 - languages which is important sometimes
40:14 - when you're naming things so that was
40:16 - our like okay let's go with instagram
40:18 - let's like stop looking at this text
40:19 - file let's get back to building it
40:22 - but the actual coding takes a lot of
40:23 - hard work and grit and late nights more
40:26 - than
40:27 - random strokes of genius i suspect
40:30 - exactly and you know and you it's
40:33 - you never know if something's going to
40:34 - work until you try it both on the coding
40:36 - side but also just on you know seeing if
40:38 - some people are going to enjoy it and
40:40 - use it so you just have to you know keep
40:42 - keep at it
40:44 - what about instagram meter resonates so
40:46 - much when people already had facebook
40:48 - and twitter and and sort of other social
40:50 - media outlets i think because it's so
40:53 - visual so you know it was so
40:55 - international even from the beginning
40:56 - like when i when we started instagram
40:59 - my family was still in brazil and but
41:01 - through instagram i made friends in
41:02 - japan i made friends in europe i made
41:05 - friends everywhere and got to know
41:07 - people's lives just because you don't
41:08 - have to speak the language you just have
41:09 - to see the photo and i think that was
41:11 - something different and new uh back then
41:13 - and i think continues to be something
41:15 - that people really like is the like the
41:16 - fact that it's not really that much
41:18 - about what you write it's just about
41:19 - what you see and what you share
41:22 - so speaking about what you see we want
41:24 - to switch to the last stage of our
41:26 - lesson yeah
41:27 - pixels but now we're going to code a
41:29 - feature of instagram uh and when you're
41:31 - coding something like instagram how much
41:33 - are you worrying about the individual
41:34 - pixels or actually not even the pixels
41:36 - the ones and zeros are you dealing with
41:39 - i want to turn that one on and that one
41:40 - off or is it is it easier than doing
41:43 - that yeah so the the good news is you
41:46 - know i think in the early days people
41:48 - really were saying like turn this pixel
41:50 - on turn this pixel off and luckily now
41:52 - we're at a level you know we call it
41:54 - abstraction where you can like go up a
41:56 - level and and uh tell the computer what
41:58 - you want it to do rather than worrying
41:59 - exactly how it's going to do it so when
42:01 - we were writing things on instagram for
42:03 - example the you know different image
42:05 - editing and filters and drawing you know
42:07 - you're usually saying all right computer
42:10 - or you know xcode or ios i want you to
42:13 - draw a line from here to here a lot like
42:15 - uh the stars that we saw earlier in the
42:17 - comment
42:18 - so that's exactly what we're going to do
42:19 - next what we're going to create is an
42:21 - image doodler which is one of my
42:22 - favorite features of instagram sophia do
42:24 - you use instagram
42:26 - no why not because i'm too young because
42:28 - you're not allowed to that's right
42:31 - instagram but uh if you were old enough
42:34 - to use instagram one of the most popular
42:35 - features is if you take a photo you can
42:37 - doodle on it and draw on it just do that
42:40 - if you go to edit you can do that in
42:42 - camera as well um
42:44 - actually the last feature i uh i wrote
42:47 - code for on instagram was the drawing
42:48 - tool oh that's pretty awesome well
42:51 - i should be able to help here
42:53 - that's so awesome that was basically the
42:54 - last thing you did on instagram and now
42:56 - we're gonna do it again in the next 15
42:58 - minutes
42:59 - it probably took you longer than 15
43:00 - minutes
43:03 - it's more work to do something at that
43:04 - scale but we're going to screen share a
43:07 - tool on code.org called app lab
43:09 - and this is basically the tool that we
43:11 - use for prototyping apps and last week
43:14 - we used it to create a password
43:15 - generator this week we're going to
43:17 - create an image doodler uh here's an
43:19 - image i've chosen but we have actually
43:21 - four choices of screens we can choose to
43:24 - doodle on one is flowers we also have a
43:27 - beach
43:28 - and then we also have a bird
43:31 - and then we also have a cat
43:33 - uh this cat is special because it's
43:35 - sophia's cat sunshine
43:37 - his name is mr sunshine and we want to
43:40 - choose which image to doodle on so
43:42 - before we actually write the code can we
43:44 - run a live poll for the audience to
43:46 - choose which of these four images we
43:48 - choose between i already know what's
43:49 - cats are very big on instagram
43:51 - cats are very big on instagram yes
43:54 - sophia's pretty excited because she was
43:56 - hoping her cat would get selected i
43:58 - think you'll like this is this is
43:59 - trending in a good direction here
44:01 - cat and beach are kind of
44:03 - duking it out
44:05 - uh but i think because we're speaking we
44:07 - have a little bit of an advantage here
44:08 - on the cat side all right can we show
44:10 - the poll results
44:12 - all right so
44:14 - you wanted the cat so that's what we're
44:15 - gonna go with um
44:17 - so i'm gonna make this the default
44:18 - screen for our app so when we start the
44:21 - app that's what we see
44:23 - and now we're going to go into the code
44:25 - for this
44:26 - so
44:26 - when we want to make the code for an
44:28 - image doodler what we're going to use is
44:30 - we're going to use the
44:32 - the turtle
44:34 - commands in the app uh but you know
44:36 - what's fun is i learned to code when i
44:38 - was 12 or 13 using logo which was the
44:42 - sort of grandfather of the turtle tool
44:45 - so that was really you know it's been
44:47 - helping people learn to code for a long
44:48 - time exactly so the turtle tool lets you
44:52 - basically say things like move forward
44:54 - move backward moves to this an x and y
44:56 - location and it draws as you get there
44:59 - but we want to know we want to make it
45:00 - follow along as our mouse does this so
45:02 - i'm going to add an event handler first
45:05 - so i'm going to say when an event
45:06 - happens
45:08 - and the event that i'm going to look for
45:10 - is on this on the cat screen
45:12 - anytime there's any movement of the
45:14 - mouse of any sort so when the mouse
45:16 - moves at any point we're going to have
45:18 - the turtle
45:19 - move to that point
45:22 - and what point do we deal with i'm going
45:24 - to put the variable here so the event
45:27 - handler and i'm going to have us move to
45:31 - dot x
45:34 - and event dot y
45:36 - in past versions of code break we
45:38 - learned about events it's like an event
45:40 - like a button click but with a mouse
45:42 - move event we actually get an event x
45:44 - and an event y so when i hit run on the
45:46 - screen you can see as i move the mouse
45:50 - it should be drawing although i'm not
45:52 - sure why it isn't
45:57 - maybe it's because my computer's
45:59 - not
46:00 - enough it's a bug is it a bug
46:03 - do we need to debug this i didn't expect
46:05 - to be developing this right now
46:10 - why is it drawing to a weird place on
46:12 - the screen
46:13 - i must have misspelled something oh i
46:16 - didn't do
46:17 - move two i didn't move
46:19 - that's
46:22 - i'm going to draw this again
46:25 - so i thought i was going to move that
46:26 - that far away from where it's from the
46:28 - center of the screen
46:30 - so it was going really far
46:33 - and
46:35 - all right so i'm using the move blocks
46:37 - now when i hit run
46:39 - as i move mouse i can see a bunch of
46:42 - doodling happening it took literally
46:44 - three lines of code and a few seconds of
46:47 - debugging to make this but there's a few
46:49 - problems with this first of all you can
46:51 - see the little arrow of this little
46:53 - turtle guy
46:54 - and i don't want that to be showing up
46:57 - and then the second thing is i can't
46:58 - stop doodling
47:00 - i'm not holding my mouse down it's just
47:01 - doodling
47:02 - whatever i do so there's a couple of
47:04 - things i want to do first
47:06 - i'm going to stop this code
47:08 - and
47:08 - first i'm going to use the hide block
47:11 - to hide that little triangle
47:14 - uh and i'm also going to set the pen
47:16 - color
47:17 - uh what color should i start this as
47:21 - blue i like blue all right well sophia
47:24 - clearly likes blue um but the other
47:26 - thing i want to do is i want to make
47:27 - sure so that the pen doesn't start as
47:29 - drawing so i'm going to start with the
47:30 - pen up
47:32 - so
47:33 - now when i hit run
47:35 - it doesn't do anything when i move
47:36 - around the mouse
47:38 - and what i want to do is
47:40 - when i hit the mouse down
47:43 - i want it to draw
47:45 - so only when i have a mouse down event
47:51 - so when the cat screen
47:53 - gets a mouse down event
47:55 - and we're going to be done real soon
47:57 - with a very basic image doodler when the
47:58 - cat screen gets a mouse down event
48:01 - i'm going to first
48:02 - move to that location
48:04 - i'm using the move to block correctly
48:06 - this time
48:08 - and i'm going to move to that location
48:10 - just like before
48:12 - event dot x
48:17 - and event dot y
48:19 - and the other thing i'm going to do is
48:21 - put the pen down
48:23 - when that happens
48:25 - and the other there's another thing i
48:27 - need to do so that's what happens when
48:28 - the mouse goes down what should i what
48:30 - is there something else i'm missing mike
48:31 - do you want to
48:33 - help me out
48:34 - okay got done you got to move to that
48:36 - place put the pen down and then you also
48:39 - need to handle the mouse up
48:41 - exactly
48:42 - mike did not know i was going to call on
48:43 - him for something like that
48:45 - so mouse up and when i have the mouse up
48:48 - what should i do
48:49 - uh you want to do pen up
48:51 - yeah
48:52 - so
48:53 - basically now we have a situation
48:56 - i don't need the event there because i
48:57 - don't need the x and y so now if i move
48:59 - around the mouse nothing happens but if
49:00 - my mouse is down
49:02 - i'm drawing
49:04 - and when my mouse is up i'm not drawing
49:07 - and my mouse is clicked down i'm drawing
49:09 - again
49:10 - and so on
49:12 - so we can do more interesting stuff to
49:14 - our doodler as well so i want to add
49:15 - some other features what are some of the
49:17 - features that image doodlers have that
49:19 - are that are fun we got to pick a color
49:21 - we could pick a color so i'm going to
49:23 - let us choose between three different
49:24 - colors
49:25 - so i'm going to add buttons to help us
49:27 - choose colors
49:29 - so this will be button one
49:31 - and button two
49:33 - and button three and we'll have three
49:34 - colors to choose
49:36 - i'll let sofia choose one of them and
49:38 - then mike to choose one and then the
49:39 - audience can choose a third color
49:42 - sophie what do you want is the color for
49:43 - your first button blue again blue yes
49:46 - all right
49:48 - so
49:50 - that's a good blue that's a good blue
49:53 - and i'll take this text off so it
49:54 - doesn't say button right mike what do
49:56 - you want for the next button uh let's
49:58 - make it red
50:00 - red
50:03 - that's a pink
50:04 - sort of bacon
50:07 - that's pretty good red
50:08 - and i'll take get rid of the text on
50:10 - this one and now let's do an audience
50:12 - poll so the audience can choose the
50:14 - color for the next button
50:15 - so
50:17 - can we put the poll on the screen of the
50:19 - the different color options
50:24 - i think we have color options queued up
50:26 - for a poll
50:30 - if we don't you have a chat
50:35 - all right we don't have the call options
50:36 - ready
50:37 - um so why don't we use a show of hands
50:40 - um we're gonna have a choice between
50:43 - uh
50:44 - we're gonna choose between green and
50:46 - yellow if you want the the button to be
50:49 - green
50:50 - click the raise hand button
50:52 - it looks like this if you can see this
50:56 - and we're going to count how many people
50:57 - raise their hands well it looks more
50:59 - like this
51:01 - so you need to click the raise hand
51:03 - button to see oh my god my screen is
51:04 - getting filled with people raising their
51:06 - hands
51:06 - i can't see anything
51:10 - all right i saw so many raised hands
51:13 - which color you guys see if you want i
51:15 - think this is great
51:17 - all right we're gonna go with green
51:19 - i can't even see what's going on my
51:21 - screen anymore because zoom has covered
51:22 - it with ray's hand buttons lower your
51:24 - hands please
51:28 - do we have all the hands lowered and i'm
51:30 - going to try to change this
51:32 - to green
51:39 - all right so this third button is green
51:41 - so now we have red blue and green
51:42 - buttons
51:48 - and i'm also going to change the text of
51:50 - this to not be button so we have these
51:52 - three buttons now having the buttons
51:54 - isn't enough to actually change the
51:55 - color of our doodler so now we actually
51:57 - need to write the code for doing this as
51:59 - well so
52:01 - for doing this now we need to actually
52:02 - go back into code mode and we need to
52:04 - write the code for what happens when any
52:06 - of these buttons are clicked so what i
52:08 - want is when i hit run if i click the
52:10 - blue button or if i click the red button
52:12 - it should change this to be red colored
52:15 - so how can i do that can you help me out
52:17 - here mike i think yeah so what we're
52:18 - going to want to do is add a new event
52:20 - handler and when you handle each button
52:23 - event we're going to set the pen color
52:25 - to each different um
52:27 - each different color
52:29 - all right so button 2 which is the blue
52:32 - one
52:32 - is gonna go and say
52:37 - set the pen color
52:43 - button two is
52:44 - blue and then i'm going to go
52:50 - on event
52:52 - when button three is pressed
52:54 - and by the the numbers of these buttons
52:56 - when i hover over and it shows me that
52:58 - this is button three and that looks like
53:00 - your video might have frozen so i don't
53:01 - know if you can uh stop and reshare to
53:04 - have it pop up again
53:05 - thank you i will do that i will stop the
53:08 - share
53:08 - thanks so much of course if you want to
53:11 - hold up the bug button to show that
53:13 - we're debugging
53:15 - we don't have it
53:16 - okay
53:19 - there we go thing is one button two is
53:21 - clicked when button three is clicked
53:23 - when each one of these buttons gets
53:24 - clicked we're gonna change the pen
53:26 - color so when button three is clicked
53:29 - we're going to choose pen color red
53:31 - and when button four is clicked
53:33 - and by the way this may look like we're
53:35 - adding a lot of code but it's so much
53:37 - less code to do it than i'm sure when
53:39 - you were doing it in instagram
53:41 - in xcode
53:42 - to be able to just say change the button
53:44 - the pen color color exactly
53:47 - all right and green
53:49 - all right so now we have so now we can
53:51 - click run and it defaults to blue
53:54 - and i can click red
53:56 - and now i got red perfect
54:00 - and green as well
54:02 - i want to add one more feature which is
54:04 - to let you choose the width of the
54:05 - doodler because as i was doodling it's
54:07 - kind of hard to
54:08 - let's add see
54:09 - slider you want to use a slider sofia so
54:12 - we'll put a slider to change the width
54:14 - uh and i'm gonna make it a bigger slider
54:16 - so we can it goes all the way across
54:21 - so and this slider basically will have a
54:23 - value that it shows
54:25 - um
54:27 - so
54:28 - where did my screen go
54:30 - [Music]
54:32 - i think my screen share just stopped
54:34 - again
54:41 - should i get my bug
54:43 - no you think we're okay with that
54:45 - um so now what we want to do is when the
54:47 - slider changes we change the pen width
54:49 - as well and this again is really simple
54:52 - so we're going to do another on event
54:53 - handler
54:55 - and mike you haven't seen how this works
54:57 - but i'm going to pull an on event yeah
54:59 - this is new
55:00 - this is new
55:01 - and when we say the slider
55:04 - the slider is what's going to generate
55:06 - the event
55:07 - and the question is what events do you
55:08 - think we're going to look for uh
55:10 - probably change
55:13 - so i'm going to look for the change
55:14 - event on the slider
55:17 - so when the slider changes and that's a
55:19 - good guess
55:20 - um now we're going to go to the turtle
55:23 - and change the pen width of the turtle
55:27 - and when the slider gets a change
55:30 - we don't want to change the
55:32 - value to three we can basically find out
55:34 - the value of the slider by saying
55:37 - getting the text
55:39 - oops it looks like you froze again
55:41 - on the video
55:43 - can i fuse again
55:44 - just a share
55:46 - oh no
55:48 - this is a tough one
55:49 - i think i should get that later thank
55:52 - you so much for calling up this doesn't
55:53 - happen usually when we do this i'm not
55:55 - sure why it's happening now
56:00 - all right can you see it now uh i can
56:02 - see it now great so we're getting the
56:03 - text from the
56:05 - and width to the value in the slider so
56:07 - if the slider is low we just have one
56:09 - value and if it's high we have another
56:10 - value so if i get the text from the
56:12 - slider
56:13 - now when i hit run
56:15 - i can set the slider to a big width
56:17 - and now i get her
56:20 - and if i have a small width
56:22 - i have a small doodle
56:24 - i can switch to green and have a small
56:26 - doodle
56:27 - and i can switch to a big width and have
56:30 - a big doodle
56:31 - um so we basically have an image doodler
56:34 - now you might not want the value to be
56:36 - big so there's lots of bugs in this
56:38 - thing that we created so far
56:40 - but this is the basics of an image
56:41 - doodler and it's one of the most popular
56:43 - features in instagram and it took only
56:45 - about 20 lines of code to create
56:47 - what's particularly cool about this is
56:50 - we can now share this out and i can
56:52 - click send to phone
56:53 - and so if any of you are at home and
56:55 - have a phone as well
56:57 - you can look at this qr code that you
56:59 - see on the screen and if you hold out
57:01 - your phone with your camera and scan
57:04 - that qr code the app that we just
57:06 - created your on your camera you should
57:08 - see a little bubble at the top of your
57:10 - phone and you can actually see a link
57:12 - and then literally the app that kept
57:13 - that we just wrote together right now
57:16 - mike and i and sophia
57:17 - can now be on your phone and you can
57:19 - actually do your own image
57:21 - and it should work on android or ios
57:23 - phones mike are you doing it yep there
57:26 - it is sophia's cat is now in the hands
57:29 - of hundreds of students um
57:32 - the really cool thing about this is that
57:34 - we wrote this code just now we created
57:36 - it and every one of you can now start
57:38 - image doodling but that image doodler
57:40 - that we have is missing a lot of
57:41 - features what are some features mike
57:43 - that you think students can add to it
57:45 - oh um let's see
57:48 - um there's always more colors um
57:51 - what else could they do um
57:55 - they could
57:57 - thicker stickers are a great idea yeah
58:00 - could do stickers you could let the the
58:02 - pen change colors while you're drawing
58:04 - that would be a really fun advanced
58:06 - feature
58:07 - oh like so like it becomes a rainbow
58:09 - kind of it becomes a rainbow we had that
58:11 - as a little easter egg in our drawing
58:12 - one and people really liked it
58:14 - that's pretty cool
58:16 - i'm gonna stop the screen share now so
58:18 - we shared out that app via the qr code
58:20 - but we're also going to send it via
58:21 - email and when you get the app via email
58:24 - any app that anybody creates on code.org
58:26 - you can remix and make your own versions
58:28 - of it
58:29 - which is pretty cool and that's actually
58:31 - one of the challenge things we're going
58:32 - to ask students to make their own
58:34 - version of the image doodler add
58:35 - features to it and then we'll have you
58:37 - present that to next week's special
58:39 - guest who's going to be an extremely
58:41 - special special guest uh i'm not sure
58:44 - i'm allowed to share who it is yet we're
58:45 - going to be announcing that i'm not
58:47 - secret it's secret we're going right
58:49 - even i don't know it's great you don't
58:51 - even know i don't think i know his first
58:53 - name is bill oh that's that's the most
58:55 - i'm gonna be able to say
58:57 - i'm too much that's not too much
59:00 - created a monster all right
59:04 - so
59:05 - let's switch to see if there's questions
59:07 - for that folks have for mike um
59:10 - mike there's a question from
59:13 - actually akira can you come on screen
59:14 - akira has been managing collecting
59:16 - questions in the background
59:19 - akira is basically one of the behind the
59:21 - scenes producers of code break and if we
59:23 - could get her on screen to ask the
59:25 - questions for mike hello everyone yes so
59:28 - mike one of the questions we have from
59:29 - sebastian it was how do you manage your
59:32 - time and what do your days look like now
59:34 - both pre-pandemic and during pandemic
59:37 - yeah um so i'm
59:39 - working on a new project with my
59:40 - instagram co-founder right now that has
59:42 - to do with covid and we're trying to get
59:44 - some good information out there um so i
59:47 - think one of the things that i've
59:48 - learned is it's easy for me to get very
59:50 - deep in coding and kind of lose track of
59:52 - the rest of the world it's probably
59:53 - happened to some of you as you as you've
59:55 - learned things and it's been
59:57 - a lesson i've learned over time that
59:59 - it's really worth taking some breaks
60:00 - going on a little walk we have a dog so
60:02 - playing with the dog seeing my daughter
60:04 - like whatever those different things are
60:06 - it might feel in the moment like you're
60:07 - like oh but i'm just coding i just can
60:09 - code for another hour but in the long
60:10 - run it's really nice to make sure you've
60:12 - got some ability to get some fresh air
60:15 - trust me i definitely had some instagram
60:16 - days where i would like get up i'm like
60:18 - i haven't showered in three days i've
60:20 - gone up from my chair in 12 hours so
60:22 - learning to have a little bit of uh of a
60:25 - break every now and then is really
60:26 - important
60:28 - thank you so much and our second
60:29 - question is for both mike and hattie the
60:31 - student said i'm interested in pursuing
60:33 - something related to computer science
60:36 - what should i do at home in order to
60:37 - prepare myself and also is there any
60:39 - code or content i should look for so
60:41 - both mike from your experience when you
60:43 - were younger and hottie from the
60:44 - code.org perspective i loved like um
60:49 - basically seeing how things were built
60:51 - so um
60:52 - as you learn to code if there's
60:54 - something that you're really interested
60:55 - like if there's a website that you think
60:57 - is really cool or if there's a project
60:59 - that you see online
61:01 - in a lot of cases the code isn't online
61:03 - if it's on github if it's on if it's
61:05 - linked from code.org
61:07 - so
61:08 - i learned a lot just from seeing how
61:10 - other people did their projects um and i
61:13 - think there's that's one of the things i
61:14 - love about computer science is there's a
61:15 - real culture of sharing like you do
61:18 - something interesting and then you can
61:19 - tell the world how you did it there's
61:20 - tutorials um so i think that's a really
61:23 - good way to continue to learn
61:26 - yeah and and there's so many one of the
61:28 - beauties of computer science is it's
61:30 - perfect for the time we're in right now
61:32 - because computer science is something
61:33 - where part of the learning comes from a
61:35 - teacher in a classroom but a huge part
61:37 - of it just comes from experimentation
61:39 - trying something seeing how it breaks
61:41 - trying it a different way you know most
61:43 - subjects in school are about a right or
61:45 - wrong answer did you get the answer
61:47 - right did you get it wrong when we made
61:49 - our image doodler there's bugs but if
61:51 - you find you always run into bugs and
61:53 - then you fix it and it's the right color
61:55 - red or green or blue you can choose what
61:56 - you want you know you get some
61:58 - expressiveness and creativity
62:01 - and and working with other people's
62:02 - projects is one great way
62:04 - if you visit code.org if you're in in in
62:08 - high school middle school or elementary
62:10 - school there's uh there's courses there
62:11 - for all ages to learn so
62:14 - if you haven't done it at all our
62:15 - express course on code.org is one of the
62:17 - best ways to do it
62:19 - if you're in school and your school
62:21 - offers computer science principles
62:23 - that's the most popular high school
62:24 - course in computer science right now
62:26 - there's over 100 000 students almost 150
62:29 - 000 students all across the united
62:30 - states taking that course with code.org
62:33 - right now so if you're in high school
62:35 - please sign up for computer science
62:37 - principles for next year and if your
62:38 - school doesn't offer it ask the
62:40 - principal to offer it code.org will
62:42 - prepare your existing teachers so that's
62:45 - a wonderful way to do it
62:47 - we're at the top of the hour so i want
62:48 - to tell people we're going to send you
62:50 - email with assignments for this week if
62:52 - you're not on our email list go to
62:54 - code.org break so you can get the
62:56 - assignments for this week and
