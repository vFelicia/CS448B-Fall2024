00:32 - hi everybody welcome to code break my
00:37 - name is Hadi partovi I'm calling from
00:39 - code.org headquarters here in our studio
00:42 - actually no I'm just at home let me
00:45 - change up my virtual background this is
00:48 - my living room and I'm joined with my
00:50 - daughter Sofia Sofia's gonna be the
00:53 - sound board manager and we're joined
00:57 - here with a whole bunch of folks there's
01:00 - about 1200 people find it on zoom'
01:03 - already and last week we had 10,000
01:06 - viewers streaming live on facebook and
01:08 - there's people joining him as we as
01:10 - we're talking still about 10 or 20 per
01:13 - per second last week we had 10,000
01:16 - viewers joining from places as far away
01:18 - as India and Spain and Greece Israel and
01:22 - Azerbaijan at all hours of the night
01:24 - thank you we're hoping together to build
01:27 - the world's largest live interactive
01:29 - classroom if you enjoy what we do here
01:31 - today please invite others to join as
01:33 - well if each one of you invites to two
01:36 - other parents or families to join we
01:38 - should hopefully be able to double every
01:39 - single week I want to introduce our
01:41 - first special guest today Lindsay Scott
01:43 - who's a actress model and also an
01:46 - awesome software engineer Lindsay how
01:48 - are you doing I'm doing well and yeah
01:51 - thanks for asking how are things in Los
01:53 - Angeles they're good I've been home
01:56 - obviously quarantined but I've enjoyed
01:59 - being home I think it's nice to have
02:01 - this time to be at home and maybe learn
02:05 - something new or or try something
02:08 - normally would have that time to do lots
02:12 - you want to share what the millions of
02:13 - students are at home without school oh
02:15 - yes I think that code code org
02:19 - especially is a great way for you to
02:22 - maybe spend your time and you can spend
02:24 - the next couple weeks in quarantine or
02:26 - however long it takes and then you could
02:28 - come out with a great new skill set so
02:31 - you yourself have been successful both
02:33 - as a model and an actress but I'm most
02:35 - interested in your computer science
02:37 - background can you share about how you
02:39 - got into computer science and what
02:41 - you're doing with it
02:42 - sure so I went into Amherst College
02:44 - knowing that I wanted to act but dropped
02:48 - my time there I made my way into
02:49 - computer science class and I loved it so
02:51 - much that I ended up double majoring in
02:53 - both theatre and computer science
02:56 - alright and now it's perfect I'm able to
02:59 - program from home here in LA and then
03:03 - normally go out and act and it's been a
03:05 - great way to find my acting career while
03:07 - I'm trying to work through that that's
03:10 - great yeah Lindsay's got an incredible
03:12 - reputation as a software engineer and in
03:14 - fact on stackoverflow which is one of
03:16 - the top websites for coders to ask
03:18 - questions and answers she has all sorts
03:20 - of questions that people ask her about
03:22 - iOS engineering and making apps which
03:25 - he's done a lot of I would say you're
03:26 - kidding yeah that's good
03:28 - you want to introduce all right so
03:34 - before we start we're gonna do a joke of
03:36 - the day or computer joke of the day so
03:38 - Lindsay why was the computer cold I
03:40 - don't know why was it called hi to all
03:53 - the other students for joining us around
03:54 - the country so who you can switch to gal
03:56 - or review and we're gonna unmute
03:58 - everybody so if you could
04:10 - [Music]
04:12 - hey Brian what's up alright so the next
04:17 - thing we wanted to do is you want to say
04:18 - hello to the audience who's not on camp
04:20 - right everybody can see you have a chat
04:23 - button on your screen if you're on a
04:26 - tablet or phone you may need to tap the
04:27 - screen to see it if you click the chat
04:29 - what you need to do is to click the
04:31 - little blue drop down that says and
04:34 - choose to all panelists and attendees
04:36 - and this way you can type in there and
04:39 - everybody can see it if you could all
04:40 - tell us where are you from and where
04:44 - people are from Illinois Tennessee
04:48 - Puerto Rico Nevada Florida let's see
04:53 - other countries Orlando Memphis Bellevue
05:00 - awesome now can people also type what
05:03 - what grade they're from Lebanon Honduras
05:08 - you type in your grade fifth grade
05:18 - fourth grade okay third first and third
05:22 - oh wow
05:23 - and so then the last thing I want to ask
05:26 - if people couldn't have twenty fifth
05:27 - grade I so want to get a sense of
05:30 - people's computer science experience if
05:33 - you could type in either one if you're a
05:36 - beginner too if you're intermediate
05:37 - three if you're advanced okay seems like
05:43 - we have a good mix some some people are
05:45 - four wow we're gonna have an opportunity
05:56 - to hear from today so you do all three
05:59 - different levels so we're gonna start
06:01 - with much more beginner stuff as we go
06:04 - along I want to give people let you know
06:06 - that there's a button for Q&A so if you
06:08 - have any questions as we go along you
06:10 - can click this button and those
06:12 - questions will come to the a team at
06:14 - code Oracle try to answer them in real
06:16 - time and we'll get hopefully a chance
06:18 - later in the episode to answer one or
06:20 - two questions live
06:22 - and for today the agenda we have is
06:26 - we're going to talk about prototyping
06:27 - and we're gonna start learning about
06:29 - first designing an app or designing on
06:31 - paper second we're gonna build an
06:33 - interactive card and then lastly we're
06:36 - gonna do rapid app design those are the
06:38 - sort of three stages of what we're gonna
06:39 - be doing and as we go through this I
06:42 - also want to call out this is our second
06:43 - time hosting code break it is not a
06:46 - simple thing to pull together with such
06:47 - a large live audience
06:49 - we have almost twice as many people
06:50 - today as we had last week if we run into
06:54 - problems we're gonna learn an important
06:55 - computer science concept called
06:56 - debugging and this is a bug that's
07:00 - Sophia Drew and so when we run into bugs
07:02 - we'll just deal with them if we have
07:04 - tech issues if people have trouble
07:06 - calling in etc um so I want to start by
07:10 - showing some of the things that the
07:12 - students who joined us last week
07:15 - submitted we asked for people to we
07:17 - learned about algorithms and how to make
07:20 - art using code and so many people shared
07:23 - your drawings to social media and I want
07:24 - to share some of these on my screen so
07:27 - this this one is from Lycia tattoo Lee
07:29 - and this was a whole team of 20 kids in
07:32 - Milan Italy that drew these different
07:35 - shapes and she said even if we're locked
07:37 - down in our houses we had fun so thank
07:39 - you Lisa for calling in from Italy and
07:42 - this other one I want to show is from
07:44 - our Nabi swass his daughters Miren Lanie
07:47 - and share Anya sent in these two
07:49 - drawings and then they've been coding
07:51 - all week making different drawings
07:54 - Arnab are you there with us right now
07:59 - can we are not to just say hi briefly
08:02 - with his daughters they're Ron's onion
08:12 - Malini how are you doing great um so
08:18 - it's great to see you and they're
08:19 - calling they're dialing in from
08:21 - Bangalore India what time is it in there
08:23 - in Bangalore right now it's 10:40 right
08:26 - now
08:27 - 10:40 in the night well thank you for
08:30 - joining us so today's computer science
08:33 - word of the day is prototype
08:35 - today Thank You Sofia for this design
08:37 - we're gonna learn how prototype starting
08:40 - with design on paper but Lindsey since
08:43 - you've made so many apps what do you do
08:45 - when you are making an app have you ever
08:47 - started by prototyping in some other
08:48 - tool before you get started yeah
08:50 - definitely
08:51 - prototyping is a great way to work out
08:54 - what your app will look like or do
08:56 - before you put too much energy into it
08:58 - it's a great way to show clients or or
09:02 - customers what you have to look forward
09:04 - to and hopefully they like it too before
09:07 - you get started alright so I want to
09:09 - show sort of a view of an example of an
09:11 - end result what we're gonna do today is
09:12 - prototype and then build an interactive
09:14 - card this here if you see my screen is
09:18 - an example of what the end result will
09:20 - look like and let me see I'm not sure if
09:25 - it's showing for people yet
09:27 - oops that's my whole screen let me come
09:32 - back and do it differently all right
09:41 - this is what an example of an
09:42 - interactive card would look like that
09:44 - we're gonna build so you have a little
09:45 - bear here that you need to feed and you
09:48 - can click on different food for him so
09:50 - you can eat the watermelon or you can
09:53 - eat the hamburger and he gets bigger as
09:55 - he eats food each time we click on
09:57 - something the bear gets bigger and
09:59 - finally he says happy crow break and we
10:01 - fed the bear it's a very simple card
10:03 - with a background in a character and
10:05 - then reacts to different behaviors we're
10:07 - gonna make a similar interactive card
10:08 - right now but we're gonna start by
10:10 - designing it on paper first so I want to
10:14 - show the example of what it's gonna end
10:15 - up looking like and now we want to have
10:17 - a number of students basically join us
10:20 - to help Lindsay design her cards so can
10:23 - we welcome David Lana and Claudia you're
10:29 - all gonna be now unmuted so you can say
10:31 - hello so David are you there yeah me
10:37 - hello where are you from where we go Oh
10:42 - Puerto Rico okay so what grade are you
10:44 - in six ever done computer programming
10:48 - before well they give it they give it
10:51 - for a grade here in school as technology
10:54 - teacher so where are you from sorry my
11:12 - animals just made a little noise
11:14 - fighting in the background where did you
11:16 - say you're from Massachusetts we're in
11:20 - Massachusetts okay I went to school in
11:25 - Massachusetts that's why I asked so what
11:28 - grade are you in
11:31 - and what's your favorite subject in
11:33 - school reading in Sophie are you
11:40 - with us as well yeah hi I Sophie are you
11:44 - and Bellevue Washington
11:48 - I'll be Washington and what grade are
11:51 - you in I'm a ninth grade okay nice high
11:54 - school so how how are you enjoying your
11:58 - quarantine is there something fun you've
11:59 - been up to uh I've been in and out my
12:07 - business Wow yeah business yeah I'm a
12:13 - fashion bad company oh wow well that's a
12:17 - great way to spend time at home you know
12:19 - so inspiring to be able to have your own
12:24 - business at your age that's amazing all
12:29 - right so now we're gonna switch to going
12:32 - to the prototypes of Lindsay we want you
12:34 - to start by asking the folks who are on
12:36 - screen they see questions to basically
12:39 - help do you design a card so and for
12:42 - everybody else who's calling in if you
12:43 - have a paper and pen please draw along
12:46 - with Lindsay so we're gonna draw the
12:47 - card in the top part of your paper and
12:49 - those have you heard live on camera you
12:51 - can do the same as well there go ahead
12:53 - Lindsay okay so let's see first we need
12:59 - to figure out what the background should
13:00 - be so should it be a city a farm a
13:05 - desert underwater a rainbow with Sun any
13:09 - ideas
13:09 - you guys can type type it in the chat
13:14 - underwater underwater people really seem
13:17 - to like this underwater idea so but
13:20 - that's very hard to draw space that's a
13:23 - good one um let's do the rainbow yes I
13:26 - can I can draw a rainbow okay and so
13:30 - next what type of characters or objects
13:35 - should we put on the card we can have a
13:39 - person an alien a bunny a cow a crab a
13:43 - fish car kangaroo anything I see some
13:48 - things miss chat but do we have any
13:50 - ideas also from our panelists panelists
13:53 - um David or Ilana or Claudia do you guys
13:57 - have any thoughts on that it may be like
14:01 - a Martian Martian okay I like that and
14:05 - it seems like some people in the chat of
14:07 - s'en said alien 2 so so that works we'll
14:10 - have a rainbow and an alien oh gosh I
14:14 - need to draw an alien okay well while
14:17 - I'm working on that so what the next
14:22 - thing we need to figure out is what
14:23 - happens when we tap be alien actually
14:25 - let's come up with two objects there's
14:27 - the alien and what else let's figure out
14:29 - one more object they see a lot of people
14:35 - saying cats
14:36 - so we'll do a cat and an alien with a
14:40 - rainbow in the back so what happens when
14:42 - we talk that alien or cat it can they
14:46 - can move they can jitter they can wander
14:49 - around they could spin I can say
14:53 - something any ideas panelist someone a
15:02 - chat dude maybe like do like a default
15:11 - dance like somebody said here like in
15:13 - for an eye or something
15:15 - unfortunately the program we're gonna
15:16 - use doesn't have that kind of capability
15:19 - but I'm sure you guys can create that in
15:21 - current sometime later okay so we'll
15:25 - have them alien spin and the other
15:31 - creature we chose maybe like teleport or
15:36 - something Oh
15:38 - teleport now we can't do that either
15:39 - unfortunately but we can make them move
15:43 - walk around say something maybe maybe I
15:47 - should say something anybody have an
15:48 - idea for what the cat can stay first
15:52 - thing it doesn't have to be meow happy
15:56 - birthday April Fool's Day okay yeah
16:00 - that's good alright so the cat will say
16:04 - so I'm going to write down
16:07 - these behaviors at the bottom of my card
16:09 - and I guess well I'll do that you
16:11 - haven't have any trivia for me hottie so
16:15 - so Lindsey's basically your drawing to
16:17 - write down basically what's gonna happen
16:19 - in terms of the code that we're gonna do
16:20 - so she's saying that when the alien is
16:22 - clicked you want the alien to do some
16:25 - spinning and when the cap is clicked you
16:28 - want the clap cat to say happy April
16:30 - Fool's Day and you're writing this down
16:33 - basically just to keep notes of / want
16:35 - to create in code and the reason to do
16:38 - this on pen and paper the first is to
16:40 - plan out what you're gonna do in code
16:41 - it's it's easy when you're in code to
16:43 - basically make mistakes and then get
16:45 - stuck and then change your code as you
16:47 - go when you write down a plan in advance
16:49 - you can then basically organize your
16:51 - thoughts and once you're coming on the
16:53 - computer you have a clear idea of what
16:55 - you want to build now for something this
16:56 - simple you don't necessarily need to do
16:58 - that but it helps to organize your
17:00 - thoughts and it dance to do this then
17:02 - there are you close enough to done to
17:04 - show us your finished paper yes here's
17:15 - my rainbow my alien and my cat and then
17:21 - it says and I think it says in reverse
17:24 - on camera but what it says here it says
17:26 - when alien is clicked it spins but cat
17:30 - says have an April Fool's Day win it
17:32 - scratch and Sophia did you make it
17:35 - yourself to show yours so if you do
17:38 - something very similar all the other
17:43 - students on the camera so we can see and
17:45 - hold up if you made drawings what you
17:47 - made all right so we're gonna next jump
17:50 - into coding to actually create something
17:52 - that does something like this and thank
17:53 - you David Lana and Sophie for joining us
17:55 - in a few minutes we're gonna learn how
17:58 - to pattern this paper prototype into an
18:00 - interactive card that Lindsey can share
18:02 - but first I want to give me just one
18:08 - second
18:09 - first we want to do trivia time Sophie
18:12 - are you ready for today's trivia
18:13 - question alright so we're gonna open a
18:17 - poll for everybody to take a
18:18 - true-and-false question
18:19 - you're gonna see a pole pop up on your
18:21 - screen if you're following on facebook
18:24 - live or some other platform you won't
18:26 - but today's question is a true or false
18:29 - question true or false the term bug or
18:33 - debugging was first used by Admiral
18:35 - Grace Hopper who found a real-life bug
18:38 - stuck inside a compiler in the 1940s so
18:42 - we're gonna keep the poll open answer
18:49 - the poll
19:09 - all right can we get the results of the
19:14 - poll up on the screen for everybody to
19:17 - see all right so it looks like 75% of
19:20 - you said that the answer is true and 25%
19:23 - of you said the answer is false
19:25 - correct answer is false even though
19:28 - Grace Hopper is known for having
19:29 - popularized the term bug or debugging
19:31 - both terms that existed before as far
19:33 - back as Thomas Edison in the 1870s and
19:36 - throughout the 1900s at bugs in those
19:41 - words were used in the context of flaws
19:42 - and engineering or robotics that
19:44 - predated modern computers but grace ha
19:47 - the first recorded incident were an
19:49 - actual real-life bug a moth got stuck
19:53 - inside a computer and caused a problem
19:55 - because she was such a well renowned
19:58 - computer scientist for the work that she
19:59 - did in in innovation with compilers she
20:03 - desi has been known as a person who
20:04 - popularized the term all right so now
20:07 - we're gonna switch to having some real
20:09 - code written and my sidekick Sophia is
20:12 - gonna be the one doing the coding and
20:13 - Lindsay's gonna be instructed in Sophia
20:16 - how to basically create the interactive
20:18 - card that we saw I'm gonna start by
20:21 - sharing Sophia's screen Sophie are you
20:23 - ready yep he was born ready all right so
20:29 - now we see Sophia's screen and Lindsey
20:31 - are you ready to give Sophia
20:32 - instructions if Lindsey's on mute can we
20:39 - unmute Lindsey so I'm gonna explain what
20:41 - we see on the screen on the left side of
20:43 - the screen here is where the card is
20:44 - gonna be made on the middle are the
20:46 - commands that Sophia can use and these
20:48 - are in different categories like world
20:50 - sprites etc and the right side over here
20:53 - is what are we gonna make her code
20:55 - Lindsey's a computer scientist so she
20:57 - does
20:58 - she works in much harder tools than this
21:00 - but she spent the night last night to
21:02 - learn this tool to help teach it to
21:04 - Sophia so go ahead Lindsey
21:08 - Oh Lindsay is still muted can somebody
21:11 - unmute Lindsay all right yes there we go
21:20 - okay perfect
21:22 - so when run we're going to when run is
21:25 - tapped we want to create a background so
21:29 - go to world and we're going to set the
21:33 - background you can drag it into the
21:36 - project underneath run there we go and
21:41 - then we're going to change that to tap
21:44 - the down arrow or tap city and we're
21:47 - going to change that to rainbow let's do
21:51 - a rainbow with Sun I think there's a
21:52 - rainbow with Sun option
21:53 - okay well rainbow works too oh nice
21:57 - and next we're going to add the sprites
22:00 - which are the objects so tap sprites
22:03 - underneath the blocks menu and you're
22:06 - going to make a new sprite so drag that
22:08 - into the project and this sprite is an
22:13 - alien so pinyin can you change out an
22:15 - alien alright that's alien like and to
22:22 - change the position of the alien tap the
22:24 - pin next to the 200 200 and then you can
22:28 - move it around wherever you want and
22:30 - it'll change the coordinates for you in
22:33 - the code alright that looks good and
22:37 - we're going to add one more sprite so go
22:39 - back to sprites and next we're going to
22:42 - add so drag in the make new sprite yeah
22:47 - and you're going to change that to cat
22:50 - and if you don't see a cat here for
22:54 - anyone who needs help you could tap more
22:56 - at the bottom and tap animals and you
23:03 - should be able to find a cat here yep so
23:06 - tap the cat and then go back to the down
23:09 - arrow and you can find the cat in that
23:10 - menu there you go and again you could
23:13 - tap the pin and move the object around
23:18 - so
23:19 - now that we've got the scene in place
23:20 - the next step is to react when the
23:24 - objects are clicked so when the alien is
23:27 - clicked it's going to spin in order to
23:29 - do this you're going to go to the events
23:31 - menu and drag in the when clicked and
23:38 - you're going to actually put it separate
23:39 - from the other code because it happens
23:41 - not one app when the project runs but
23:45 - when the items clicked so you could
23:47 - change that to the alien great and we're
23:54 - going to add a behavior so go to the
23:56 - b-58 behaviors and let's find the
24:00 - behavior of spinning either left or
24:08 - right
24:08 - I think either works oh one more thing
24:11 - back in behaviors scroll up and you're
24:16 - going to add the sprite begins to
24:19 - connect the click action to the spinning
24:23 - action and then put the spinning when
24:26 - the click action ian's perfect
24:30 - now I'm change that sprite object to the
24:37 - alien so when the alien is clicked the
24:39 - alien will spin left now let's try
24:42 - running it now to see what happens
24:46 - okay well that aliens actually spinning
24:49 - kind of fast for its own liking we don't
24:51 - want it to get sick so let's press the
24:53 - edit button stop the project press the
24:55 - edit button and let's slow down that
24:57 - spin by by cutting down a number of
25:00 - degrees it it goes for each timer cycle
25:06 - so let's change any of the behaviors
25:09 - that you actually see so Sophia you can
25:11 - change the speed of the spin here yeah
25:13 - so you could change that number ten to
25:15 - one let's be gentle to this alien
25:18 - perfect okay now let's try running that
25:22 - again much better all right let's stop
25:25 - it for now and then we're gonna add the
25:26 - one last action
25:29 - the cat saying happy April Fool's Day so
25:32 - back in the events menu drag in a click
25:37 - action change that to cat and then the
25:44 - options have print something actually is
25:46 - in the world menu so top world and you
25:50 - could dry again print and put it right
25:53 - on your with clicked when clicked and
25:55 - you can type in happy happy April Fool's
25:59 - Day perfect ok so now that everything's
26:12 - in place we can build and run what build
26:14 - run normally I build and run because I
26:17 - have to compile the estimate run then
26:22 - you can click them and see you do the
26:23 - pieces yeah and now we can click happy
26:26 - April Fool's Day it says it at the top
26:30 - and one last thing I want to do just for
26:33 - them more advanced people in the top
26:35 - right corner there's a code button so
26:37 - let's take a look at what we did in code
26:39 - and the top right of the workspace there
26:44 - we go so that's real code underneath all
26:46 - of that action pretty cool so this is
26:49 - the JavaScript code behind everything
26:50 - that we did includes the blocks that we
26:53 - dragged out but it also includes the
26:55 - definitions of the various behaviors as
26:57 - well as you can see spinning is defined
27:01 - as how it's done so behind all these
27:04 - blocks there's real JavaScript and even
27:06 - though drag-and-drop coding is the way
27:07 - people start learning it as you get more
27:10 - experience you end up using sort of a
27:12 - typed programming language or you need
27:14 - to type in the code the capabilities are
27:16 - very very similar and it's more about
27:18 - thinking how you want to put your code
27:21 - interactions together what we built here
27:23 - today was relatively simple there's a
27:25 - lot more actions a lot more types of
27:27 - events and a whole lot of types of
27:29 - behaviors for what you can do with with
27:31 - it making an interactive card and when
27:33 - you're done making your card you can
27:35 - click the share button and then you get
27:38 - a link to the card that you can share
27:39 - and send to a friend
27:41 - you can send it to a phone or did send
27:43 - it to your mom or dad's phone to get
27:44 - that your interactive card on your phone
27:46 - if you have an account on Facebook or
27:48 - Twitter you can post it to social media
27:49 - and so basically after you're done
27:52 - making your creation you can share it
27:54 - and at the end of this episode we're
27:55 - gonna email all of you the information
27:57 - for how to make your own card and we'd
27:59 - love for you to share where you create
28:01 - and then on next week's show we're gonna
28:03 - showcase the best things people created
28:06 - so next I want to see if we have any
28:10 - questions for Lindsey let me stop doing
28:12 - my screen share and if you remember we
28:15 - have the option for doing Q&A now it's a
28:20 - good time for Chad apps don't I have to
28:24 - use Swift or iOS programming um that's a
28:28 - good question gets a bit more advanced
28:29 - but I'm definitely going to answer it um
28:32 - so with the programming idea you can
28:35 - either use Swift which is Apple's
28:36 - programming language or you could use
28:38 - objective-c which is the older language
28:40 - that was originally the only language
28:43 - you could use for iOS development so
28:44 - yeah now I normally code in Swift you
28:47 - normally code in Swift whoa you later
28:49 - today is using a code or a tool called
28:51 - app lab which is great for prototyping
28:52 - it doesn't create iOS apps it creates
28:56 - what's called web apps the benefit of
28:58 - web apps is that you can see them on
28:59 - your phone very quickly and you can see
29:01 - the minoan page on any kind of phone
29:04 - rather than the the process of building
29:07 - a real iOS app has a lot of extra steps
29:09 - and you also need a more powerful
29:12 - computer and you can only actually do it
29:13 - on a on a Mac I believe partition Drive
29:18 - and into the computer but yeah I mean
29:20 - that's a great way I need to check out
29:22 - this tool before I you know get into the
29:25 - hard coding definitely a good way to
29:26 - prototype sounds like um and Akira or a
29:31 - person from coder is on the line as well
29:34 - to ask students from the the broader
29:37 - audience that I've used the cuny but
29:38 - Mercure are you there
29:39 - I am Hadi hi how are you all so we have
29:45 - a question for both Hadi and Lindsey
29:46 - first why do you both like coding so
29:48 - much what drew you to the field for me
29:52 - it felt like
29:54 - soon as I got at the class I was just so
29:55 - excited I was raising my hand all the
29:57 - time because it felt like I was playing
29:58 - logic games so even now it still feels
30:01 - like I'm solving these little logic
30:03 - games and then I end up with this
30:05 - masterpiece at the end of creating
30:09 - exactly what I wanted to create to begin
30:10 - with it's very exciting to me I got into
30:14 - coding when I was growing up in Iran and
30:17 - this was actually during the iran-iraq
30:18 - war it was a terrible place to grow up
30:21 - my neighborhood was getting bombed every
30:23 - single night so I we spent every night
30:24 - in the basement holding our ears hoping
30:27 - in your house wasn't gonna get destroyed
30:28 - by the bombing but so for me the
30:31 - computer that my dad brought my back
30:33 - home for my brother and I was our one
30:35 - escaped from a really terrible whole
30:36 - world and we learned how to code on that
30:39 - and then when we came to the United
30:41 - States as immigrants my family didn't
30:43 - have a lot of money but it as as early
30:45 - as 14 years old I started interning at
30:47 - tech companies and so for me back then
30:50 - coding was their way to is he make extra
30:52 - money and took help our family get our
30:54 - lives started in the in a new country as
30:57 - immigrants but really the beauty of
30:59 - computer science and the reason I
31:01 - started org is not just because you can
31:04 - get jobs as a code because the
31:05 - creativity because it helps teach you
31:08 - how to think and even if you don't want
31:10 - to get into computer science as a career
31:12 - it helps give you an understand how the
31:14 - world around you works everything around
31:16 - us is increasingly impacted by
31:19 - technology and the confidence of knowing
31:21 - you can build that own technology
31:23 - yourself you understand how it works you
31:26 - can program the world rather than having
31:27 - it will program you is something that
31:29 - every student should have the
31:30 - opportunity to learn yeah that's one
31:32 - thing I love about programming is that
31:34 - any interest you have can be made better
31:36 - by technology and to have the tools to
31:39 - build ask really powerful and Lindsay we
31:42 - have one more question for you before
31:43 - you go this person said you're
31:45 - successful in so many fields during
31:47 - actress your model your computer
31:49 - scientist you basically do it all what
31:51 - advice would you have for a young coder
31:53 - who is also interested in other things
31:54 - how if you learned to balance all of
31:56 - your priorities yeah I've been really
31:58 - lucky so at a certain point I was
32:00 - modeling and it was so time
32:02 - zooming that was all I could do but then
32:04 - I I moved out to LA to focus on my
32:06 - acting and in order to focus on it I
32:09 - knew that I had to make some money from
32:11 - doing something and so that's when I
32:13 - started doing client work for different
32:16 - app companies and so it's have been
32:19 - great that I've been able to make a
32:21 - living from doing that and support my
32:23 - acting work but it's also been great
32:25 - that I've been able to use my interest
32:26 - in acting to inspire some of the apps
32:29 - that I created like I just created this
32:31 - self tape app crackers and it's just
32:35 - nice to have that perfect meshing of my
32:39 - interest and my skill set thank you so
32:43 - much Lindsay and thank you hi thank you
32:45 - and if we could switch to gallery view
32:47 - and give a chance for everybody to say
32:50 - goodbye to Lindsay thank you so much for
32:51 - joining us Lindsay know you're allowed
32:58 - to stay on if you want to I wasn't sure
33:00 - if your time is emitted we'd love to
33:01 - have wonderful well then you can get to
33:04 - see how Apple AB works as well so Thank
33:07 - You Lindsay now we're gonna welcome our
33:10 - next special guest Mark Cuban needs no
33:13 - introduction and we are so lucky to have
33:14 - him on the second episode of code break
33:16 - market I'm here with my daughter Sophia
33:19 - they said yeah but you doesn't students
33:22 - you see on camera there's about 1,700
33:25 - students live on zoom' and on Facebook
33:27 - we're gonna have on the order of 10 to
33:29 - 20,000 folks watching the live stream as
33:31 - well - guys I'm hanging in there you
33:35 - know it's fascinating listening to your
33:37 - story howdy growing up and what you had
33:39 - to deal with because it's relevant to
33:41 - what people are going through today I
33:43 - mean we've tried to teach my are kids
33:45 - who are 10 13 and 16 now you may think
33:48 - this is bad but what others have gone
33:50 - through this is this is nothing I mean -
33:52 - to wake up to bombs and not know if your
33:55 - buildings still going to be there or
33:56 - where you're going to live it's you know
33:58 - it's it's a lesson of resilience that
34:00 - I'm glad you could share with us thank
34:02 - you for folks in the audience if you
34:05 - have questions for mark again use the
34:07 - Q&A button and we're going to have a
34:08 - chance to have some of those questions
34:10 - answered when you type your question
34:12 - please enter your name and also where
34:14 - you're from so we can call
34:15 - let outs so marked 90% of the students
34:18 - in the world are now studying home alone
34:20 - do you have any words of inspiration or
34:23 - encouragement for them you know this is
34:25 - the chance you have if there's something
34:27 - you really like to do to try to be great
34:29 - at it you know I started going back on
34:31 - the piano which I haven't been in years
34:33 - you know just picking up some of my
34:35 - favorite songs and and annoying my kids
34:37 - and my wife but you know Reed picking up
34:40 - books that that I wanted to get to
34:42 - whatever it may be however you learn
34:44 - what a great time to learn absolutely
34:47 - and you know the first you're so well
34:50 - known for the work on Shark Tank and
34:52 - also for you know for owning a
34:54 - basketball team but the very first
34:56 - companies that you started as businesses
34:58 - were tech companies can you tell us more
34:59 - about those and how you got one of my
35:02 - first jobs out of college was working
35:03 - with for a software company way back
35:05 - when and I could started a company
35:07 - called micro solutions in the 80s and we
35:10 - were one of the very first companies to
35:11 - connect pcs together when back then
35:13 - people thought there was no need to
35:15 - connect a PC together I'll just carry my
35:17 - floppy disk from this PC to that PC and
35:20 - so I started doing local area networks I
35:22 - taught myself to code I didn't have a
35:24 - technical background but the way I
35:26 - always looked at technology was that
35:28 - there's the the person who developed it
35:30 - whether it was software or hardware then
35:32 - there was everybody else so I was
35:34 - effectively tied for second place and if
35:36 - I worked hard to learn it then I can
35:38 - learn it as well as everybody maybe even
35:40 - as much as the original developer and
35:42 - that gave me an edge to be able to apply
35:44 - to different businesses and that's how I
35:47 - grew that business and then after I sold
35:49 - that took a few years having fun and
35:51 - then in the mid 90s when the internet
35:53 - was starting to take off I felt a friend
35:56 - of mine from college Todd Wagner and I
35:57 - decided you know what this new internet
35:59 - thing there's got to be a way we could
36:01 - do audio over the internet so we can
36:02 - listen to Indiana basketball and
36:04 - effectively we had the first streaming
36:07 - business in the country in the world and
36:09 - that was a company called audio net and
36:11 - you know it was it was an early early
36:13 - version of what we're doing right now
36:15 - yeah that's great so you know learning
36:19 - computer science is what we're here
36:20 - about and it's obviously part of how you
36:22 - got your early starts there's about a
36:24 - hundred thousand students in the country
36:26 - right now they're taking a course called
36:27 - compete
36:28 - science principles and for many of them
36:30 - they're taking as an Advanced Placement
36:31 - course for credit and in that course one
36:35 - of the things you work up to is to build
36:37 - and prototype an app that as something
36:40 - that you build by the end of the course
36:41 - and the students who take that course
36:43 - and use a tool called a pleb for their
36:46 - prototyping and in fact the AP exam
36:48 - unlike most AP exams which are like a
36:50 - multiple-choice test and just QA you
36:53 - actually to submit the app you create to
36:55 - the College Board and your graded not
36:57 - only on your coding but also in your
36:59 - creativity it's a wonderful course
37:00 - that's great if there's any high school
37:02 - students in the audience if your high
37:04 - school offers CS principles you should
37:06 - take the class and if it doesn't I hope
37:08 - you incurred your principal to ask added
37:10 - to the class schedule with help from
37:12 - code org so for the next segment we've
37:15 - selected three students to pitch their
37:17 - app ideas right it is like Shark Tank
37:22 - but there's a there's a twist there
37:25 - they're gonna pitch you their ideas
37:26 - they're gonna get your feedback but for
37:29 - the choice of what which app we're gonna
37:31 - pick we're gonna let the entire audience
37:32 - choose one winner I like it I like it a
37:35 - lot cool about this since our word of
37:37 - today is prototype what we're gonna do
37:40 - is we're gonna let the audience choose
37:42 - the winning idea and then we're gonna
37:44 - prototype it today live in code I'm no
37:47 - we're gonna prototype in live in code if
37:49 - you have a phone separate from the
37:51 - screen you're watching on you'll be able
37:52 - to get it right on your phone by the end
37:55 - of the hour I'm not sure that's ever
37:58 - been done before it's our first time
38:00 - doing everything here so forgive us so
38:05 - we've now selected three students to
38:06 - pitch their app ideas to get their
38:08 - feedback from mark and we've got so many
38:11 - amazing student submissions by the way
38:13 - since we announced this on Friday I made
38:15 - the time to look at all of them myself
38:16 - and I was blown away the the three we
38:19 - picked one is that I thought we could
38:22 - prototype in real time because we want
38:24 - to teach you how to make an app and
38:25 - coding it live so nicely for you to hear
38:28 - from students give them come the idea
38:31 - I'm gonna introduce the students my
38:33 - daughter Sophia is going to manage the
38:35 - one minute timer if people she's ready
38:38 - set go and if people go over
38:41 - she's gonna make a sound so if you do
38:42 - you have a sound Sophie do you wanna
38:45 - practice your sound first time sound and
38:52 - then mark after each pitch we wanted to
38:54 - ask probing questions getting back have
38:56 - them have a chance to talk with you so
38:59 - first we have Yasmine and I'm Tara from
39:00 - Nevada and Yasmine is gonna present
39:02 - Yasmine are you there with us ready set
39:13 - go
39:14 - did you know that 57% of Generation Z
39:17 - doesn't know what they have in their
39:18 - savings pod the savings will fix that
39:21 - our app is it financing how about
39:22 - teaches young adults how to manage their
39:24 - expenses through a reward system
39:26 - last summer I added difficult time
39:27 - managing my finances I I didn't have the
39:31 - organizational skills needed to create a
39:33 - balanced budget as I spoke to my peers I
39:35 - realized an same problems as me as young
39:38 - adults were given many new financial
39:39 - responsibilities that I'm a new
39:42 - financial responsibility but do not have
39:44 - time or skills to create balanced
39:45 - budgets this app divides your salary to
39:48 - different categories that you choose
39:49 - such as housing and food and each
39:51 - category you set a price range and if
39:53 - you stay within the price range you earn
39:54 - points but if you exceed it you lose
39:56 - points and once you accumulate a Sarah
39:58 - mad appointee to win prizes such as gift
40:00 - cards and quokka merchandise this reward
40:02 - system is used to UM to make saving more
40:07 - fun for our users and ultimately prepare
40:09 - the youth for fully entering the
40:11 - consumer world thank you I wish you
40:18 - could teach all the Shark Tank
40:19 - contestants to go that fast and be
40:20 - that's the thing it's a great idea now
40:24 - there's a lot of competition out there
40:26 - there's others elders that deal with
40:27 - budgeting but I think if you hear the
40:31 - app towards a younger audience like
40:32 - who's watching today then there's a real
40:35 - need for financial education because to
40:37 - your point most kids don't understand it
40:40 - and even a lot of adults don't
40:41 - understand it so the question I would
40:43 - have is what kind of learning modules
40:46 - would you include so that kids can under
40:49 - two so that kids can learn more about
40:51 - finance and how it works so in our app
40:54 - um it's going to automatically so it's
41:00 - gonna divide your seven different
41:01 - categories that we based on so we're
41:03 - gonna have I heard the percent rule but
41:06 - I it might have been like the 30 20 10 I
41:10 - forgot but in terms of distribution of
41:14 - where you put your money how you saved
41:15 - your money right right and that's good
41:17 - so but I think think the key to this is
41:19 - really working partnering with some
41:21 - folks that can provide you a lot of
41:23 - educational materials right because it's
41:26 - hard to put together a budget if you
41:28 - don't know what each category stands for
41:30 - you know it makes it more difficult so
41:32 - just and the second question is will you
41:34 - be able to retrieve specific category
41:37 - amounts from someone's bank account or
41:40 - are you looking for them to enter it
41:41 - manually sir looking for them to enter
41:44 - it enter their own categories manually
41:46 - and will sync up the purchases they make
41:50 - with their being counts so they have a
41:51 - good transportation category it's gonna
41:53 - show that purchase history with like
41:55 - your gas and your insurance bill and
41:57 - everything like that so you got it yeah
42:00 - right
42:01 - so let's switch to our next app which is
42:04 - from Paige from Texas Paige are you
42:06 - there with us
42:11 - can we unmute Paige I paint Sofia you
42:18 - want to kick her off are you ready I'm
42:20 - ready whenever you are
42:21 - ready set go kids love repetitive games
42:26 - my app uses repetition by asking the
42:29 - user to input one good thing about
42:30 - themselves per day the first time the
42:33 - user does this a small tree is planted
42:34 - but each time they enter a compliment to
42:37 - themselves it grows as the user gets
42:40 - into the app they'll start to receive
42:41 - notifications of positive impacts the
42:44 - tree has on the community like being
42:46 - able to provide shade on a sunny day not
42:49 - only does the repetition allow the kid
42:51 - to have the habit or reform the habit of
42:55 - good self-confidence but the symbolism
42:58 - of the tree shows that our own
43:00 - self-confidence positively impacts the
43:02 - world around us this can be used by
43:06 - parents kids teachers and counts
43:08 - to show kids that we can build our own
43:11 - self-confidence and have the tools we
43:14 - need to succeed that's great I think
43:19 - it's a great idea
43:21 - how are you looking to code it look what
43:23 - tools were you looking to use so my I'm
43:26 - in a computer science class right now
43:28 - and we're in mobile app in gaming and
43:30 - definitely like Hadi said using a web
43:32 - app just so it was more accessible for
43:35 - people to get into it but then also
43:38 - easier for me to code just because web
43:41 - coding is a little bit easier than Swift
43:43 - how are you like daily inspirations to
43:46 - people to get them excited and remind
43:49 - them to continue to use the app how I
43:51 - guess the better question is how are you
43:53 - going to how are you going to incent
43:55 - them to continue to use it
43:56 - I like the reinforcement of the tree but
43:58 - sometimes people need to be reminded
44:00 - sure so I would probably if I'm using a
44:04 - web app I would set up an email system
44:06 - just so you know daily they would get an
44:08 - email or they could opt out of that if
44:10 - they feel they're comfortable but
44:12 - definitely an email system and maybe
44:14 - adding things to the tree every once in
44:16 - a while like cherried making it a cherry
44:19 - blossom on a certain day you know just
44:20 - so they're excited to come back will you
44:23 - allow perhaps like Instagram
44:25 - oh absolutely I like it I like I like
44:29 - the idea thank you alright so the third
44:32 - student is Trisha from Pennsylvania as
44:35 - Trish that we're gonna unmute you so you
44:37 - get a chance to introduce yourself and
44:39 - Sophia's gonna give you your ready set
44:40 - go or you are you there with us Trisha I
44:42 - am here I trace on hi okay three two one
44:49 - go hi my name is Trisha and I'm a junior
44:53 - at the Episcopal Academy right outside
44:55 - of Philadelphia it is my passion to save
44:57 - the mother earth that inspired me to
44:59 - start a save the planet Club in my
45:00 - sophomore year and it had an
45:02 - overwhelming response however I always
45:04 - had one issue when approached by one of
45:07 - my peers who asked how they can help in
45:08 - this global issue I was only able to
45:11 - give responses that benefited my local
45:13 - community due to a lack of centralized
45:15 - global data the homepage of my app lists
45:19 - sustainability issues such as ocean
45:21 - pollution
45:22 - depletion and deforestation the user can
45:25 - click one of these issues and will be
45:26 - taken to a page that specifies the
45:28 - broader concept for instance ocean
45:30 - pollution the next step is plastic or
45:32 - Wildlife as interested the user can
45:35 - select any one of these options each
45:37 - with their own facts and figures page
45:39 - and resources to directly aid each issue
45:41 - this format and many others can be
45:45 - provided for a variety of global
45:46 - problems including Koba 19 and provides
45:49 - a succinct platform to make a change Oh
45:52 - God
45:53 - so effectively you want to be a home
45:55 - page for all things related to
45:58 - sustainability for the planet
46:00 - essentially there are like different
46:02 - options hopefully so you can pick what
46:04 - you are interested in an 8 in that ok
46:07 - and how will you source all the data
46:08 - that you'll present so a lot of these
46:11 - come from rabb-ul sources so UN has a
46:13 - bunch of great sources as does NASA and
46:17 - I think if we collect data from those
46:19 - sites that are incredibly reliable then
46:22 - the information will come together very
46:23 - quickly how will you make that
46:25 - connection will you how do you think
46:26 - you'll be able to automate it
46:28 - are there api's to your sources do you
46:30 - know yet I I don't
46:33 - okay I'm hoping that it will become
46:35 - clear once that's all put together in
46:38 - one place yeah cuz I think it could be
46:40 - really cool if the data updates in real
46:43 - time so it gives people a reason to go
46:45 - back all the time right because that's
46:47 - the hard part sustaining their interest
46:48 - in the app but it's a cool idea
46:50 - congratulations thank you so much I want
46:55 - to thank all three of the panelists for
46:56 - your ideas and I wanted to say also
46:58 - again that like I said earlier we had so
47:01 - many amazing submissions from students
47:03 - it was so hard to pick the three that we
47:05 - picked and part of why we picked them is
47:07 - so that we could wrap it prototype them
47:09 - so now we want to let the audience
47:11 - choose between these three app ideas and
47:13 - to see which one we're gonna rapid
47:15 - prototype we're gonna put a poll on the
47:17 - screen so everybody should get a chance
47:19 - to vote for different screens that hole
47:22 - might take a little longer to take and
47:24 - for those who are watching a little
47:25 - Facebook live livestream it might be a
47:28 - little bit of you well you won't see the
47:30 - poll that will show you the results
47:31 - afterwards
47:33 - all right so the votes are coming in I
47:36 - can see them but we haven't shared them
47:38 - yet there's I think I see a winner
47:42 - already but it's a tight contest I don't
47:48 - want to share the results here until we
47:49 - have more votes in so Paige well let me
47:53 - vote you guys would let me fall down bad
47:55 - we didn't want to put too much pressure
47:57 - on the students it's okay all right I
48:03 - think we're ready to share the results
48:05 - of the vote do you all see them can we
48:08 - share these out to the screen there's a
48:10 - tight contest wow that is really tight
48:16 - thank you so much to the other
48:18 - contestants and Paige if you could stick
48:20 - around because we're gonna want your
48:22 - help for actually designing your app
48:24 - obviously everybody can stay online but
48:26 - we're gonna mute folks we also have
48:28 - before we switch to the live coding and
48:30 - Mark since you're short on time we were
48:31 - gonna do the coding parts after you hang
48:34 - up with us both yeah a little bit of
48:36 - time for some additional Q&A for mark so
48:38 - students from home if you remember you
48:41 - can submit your question using the Q&A
48:43 - box we're gonna take two questions
48:45 - quickly because mark is short on time
48:47 - and congratulations to Paige it was a
48:50 - great app Paige you were my favorite I
48:52 - kind of liked the way it turned out all
48:54 - right so so here's one from mark he says
48:59 - or a question for mark a student says
49:01 - I'm eight and I invest with my
49:03 - grandparents do you have any advice for
49:06 - how to weight or invest now how do I
49:09 - learn from this as a great question that
49:13 - is a great question first I say watch
49:14 - Shark Tank on Friday nights on ABC
49:16 - because you'll learn about all different
49:18 - kinds of businesses because the key to
49:20 - investing in the stock market is
49:22 - understanding the company that you're
49:24 - going to invest in there's there's no
49:26 - real easy way that's why people make and
49:28 - lose money but at eight years old I
49:30 - would tell you look at the companies
49:32 - that you like to use you know maybe if
49:36 - you're a gamer what companies are into
49:38 - gamey but find the companies that you
49:39 - like and if you think they're really
49:41 - popular check to see if their stocks for
49:43 - them and dip your toe and then
49:45 - in 30 years 40 years you'll be dealing
49:48 - with all right another questions didn't
49:52 - ask if the student has a great app idea
49:54 - and has a paper or coded prototype where
49:57 - do they go to get it to the next level
49:58 - and this is finger right this one right
50:02 - here you learn you learn how to code you
50:04 - know and you're old enough to learn how
50:06 - to code and to prototype it and to put
50:08 - together you know at least a Minimum
50:10 - Viable Product is what they call it an
50:12 - MVP so that you can see if the worst and
50:15 - you know what I'm sure you have friends
50:16 - that are really into coding - it's
50:18 - really fun to work with your friends and
50:20 - maybe even other family to put together
50:22 - apps it's really it's a great goal to
50:24 - set together especially now so you know
50:27 - what I have total confidence you can
50:28 - figure it out in the next two months so
50:31 - many people are going to be staying and
50:32 - studying at home it's a great
50:33 - opportunity to develop new skills all
50:38 - right well thank you so much for that
50:39 - for these I'm going to actually suggest
50:41 - actually there's one question that just
50:43 - came in somebody said how do you use
50:45 - computer science to help your basketball
50:47 - team we use it all the time
50:49 - we call it analytics because we want to
50:52 - be able to monitor during the game as a
50:54 - player getting tired you know we monitor
50:56 - heart rates we monitor speed we monitor
50:59 - a lot of different variables that we put
51:02 - into algorithms that tell us okay this
51:04 - is the path they're on they're gonna be
51:06 - tired too quickly we track how they work
51:08 - out we track their performance how they
51:10 - shoot every piece of data we try to use
51:13 - to get a competitive advantage to help
51:15 - our Mavericks win a game and I'll tell
51:17 - you this if you want to work in sports
51:19 - learn to code learn statistics and learn
51:23 - artificial intelligence you may think
51:25 - because you're just a middle school or
51:27 - younger you may be too young you're not
51:29 - artificial intelligence is gonna be so
51:31 - impactful that by learning your
51:33 - programming languages any of them you'll
51:36 - be prepared to really be ahead of the
51:37 - curve when you get to high school
51:38 - college alright thank you so much mark
51:42 - before we wrap adapt design and Mark
51:45 - you're welcome to stick around to watch
51:46 - it'll take about 15 minutes but I don't
51:49 - think you have the time because yeah but
51:52 - no I appreciate it thanks Sophia you
51:54 - were great and congratulations to Paige
51:57 - all right well thank you and I'd like to
51:59 - right everybody to wave goodbye to
52:01 - market as we say for joining us and can
52:04 - you set the applause thanks guys
52:07 - right bye mark thank you so now we're
52:12 - gonna switch and introduce a lady named
52:15 - Hannah Walden Hannah what Hannah is one
52:17 - of the top computer science teachers in
52:20 - the entire country and she's one of the
52:22 - co-authors of the CS principles course
52:24 - that I was talking about earlier so
52:27 - Hannah's gonna be the one to actually
52:28 - rapid prototype Paige's idea and act so
52:33 - and also Hannah has had a little bit of
52:36 - a head start for the last five minutes
52:37 - of Q&A just because we're short on time
52:39 - so she hopefully got started building
52:42 - some of it but if we could unmute Hannah
52:44 - and introduce her hello everyone hi
52:48 - Paige Congrats on your winning idea I'm
52:52 - super excited to help you turn your
52:55 - mental wellness app into this prototype
52:58 - now Paige are there while we're getting
53:04 - Paige unmuted I'm gonna explain a little
53:06 - bit what's on your screen here so this
53:09 - is a pleb and we're gonna be working in
53:11 - a plaid Apple app has a couple different
53:14 - modes
53:14 - I have design mode and code mode and in
53:18 - design mode I can set up just how I want
53:20 - my screen to look by dragging on
53:22 - different elements so I can put a button
53:24 - on I can put an image in I could put a
53:27 - drop down on that the user could select
53:30 - like this oops let's go back to the
53:33 - screen that I'm on there we go
53:35 - and many different things that I can do
53:38 - and I can drag and drop these around I
53:40 - can change what's on these different
53:41 - buttons I could say hello and have the
53:44 - user click on this button so I can set
53:46 - all of this up in design mode and then
53:49 - in a little bit we're gonna hop into
53:51 - code mode and here is where I'm actually
53:52 - going to code the app all right Paige
53:56 - are you there hello hi Paige
53:59 - alright let's get started so as Hadi
54:02 - said while we were doing Q&A I got a bit
54:04 - of a head start
54:06 - so I have just the basics of the app
54:09 - laid out here but I want to get some
54:11 - ideas from you Paige so first
54:13 - what would you like for the title of
54:15 - your app okay you know one of the first
54:19 - things you should think of them I didn't
54:24 - maybe just okay this is something we
54:31 - could ask the people watching right you
54:35 - type in the chat with the title should
54:38 - be sure all right
54:40 - and howdy can you read from the chat for
54:43 - me giving tree tree giving tree Oh
54:46 - perfect okay so that's a great start and
54:53 - here's the basic layout of the home
54:55 - screen and again page this is all set so
54:58 - that we can change things around we can
55:00 - move things I've got an image here that
55:02 - starts as just a little seed and then as
55:04 - the user interacts it will grow into a
55:08 - tree I've got a place down here this is
55:11 - a user input input box where users can
55:14 - type in their positive comments but what
55:17 - I'm missing here is a button for users
55:20 - to click when they've added a comment
55:21 - I'm gonna drag a button over here like
55:24 - that
55:25 - and let's actually I'm gonna call this
55:29 - button my add button and instead of
55:32 - having the word button on it let's
55:35 - actually pick an icon instead so I'm
55:39 - gonna look and see what I have here all
55:42 - right page what do you like I've got
55:44 - plus with the square with the circle
55:46 - what looks good to you I like the the
55:49 - plus square what Square perfect okay we
55:53 - can also change the color of the icon do
55:55 - you have a preference there um
55:58 - maybe green okay perfect all right let's
56:02 - go with a green that shows up kind of a
56:06 - bright green all right perfect
56:08 - okay so now when the user put something
56:12 - in they're going to click on this plus
56:13 - button this add button and we will store
56:17 - their information and that will impact
56:18 - the tree that we see here I also put
56:22 - together one other screen this is the
56:24 - journal screen so
56:26 - I was thinking Paige was I'm on the
56:28 - homescreen and I add in different
56:32 - comments that I've made about myself and
56:34 - I want to save them now I can go to my
56:37 - journal by clicking the growth journal
56:39 - button and now I can see those things
56:42 - listed out here and I can go back to my
56:45 - home here before I do that I have the
56:49 - journal right here and it doesn't have a
56:50 - background color it's transparent so I
56:53 - was wondering Paige do you have a color
56:56 - that you'd prefer for our journal
56:57 - background um I like the light blue you
57:00 - chose all right let's see if I can get
57:04 - back to something Jimmy like this light
57:07 - blue right here right perfect
57:10 - okay so actually I can copy that hex
57:13 - code exactly go back over here go to my
57:17 - background color and now it matches
57:20 - perfectly okay all right so we've got
57:24 - the basic layout of our app we've got
57:28 - the title we've got the image we've got
57:29 - a place for the user to add their
57:31 - comment and to add in the comment and
57:34 - then we've got the journal so let's go
57:36 - code this app all right we're gonna work
57:41 - in block mode today and first we're
57:44 - going to pick the variables that we're
57:46 - going to store information in so I'm
57:48 - gonna drag a variable block out here and
57:51 - the first thing that I'm going to store
57:52 - is the comment the next thing that I
57:56 - want to store I know I'm gonna want to
57:57 - store how many comments the user has
58:00 - made so I'm gonna say comments count and
58:04 - right now how many comments do I have
58:05 - page zero zero so let's set that to zero
58:10 - I have no comments right now so I'm just
58:14 - gonna put an empty string up here it's
58:16 - completely blank now here's what's gonna
58:19 - happen when I click this button I'm
58:23 - gonna get the information from here it's
58:25 - gonna store in this variable up here the
58:28 - comment variable and then it's going to
58:31 - display the correct tree version and to
58:35 - do that I'm going to grab an on event
58:37 - block this yellow on event block
58:40 - drag it over and I'm going to choose the
58:43 - ID for this button which is the add
58:45 - button so when the add button is clicked
58:49 - I'm going to get the comment and I'm
58:53 - gonna update my variable so I'm gonna
58:56 - put the name of the variable here
58:57 - comment and now I'm gonna do some fancy
59:02 - stuff Here I am going to and I'm
59:04 - actually gonna close down my tool box
59:06 - you can see all this first I'm going to
59:09 - get whatever comments were previously
59:12 - stored at the beginning there's nothing
59:14 - it's just blank but as we add more and
59:16 - more comments we want to make sure that
59:17 - we don't forget those old comments I'm
59:20 - gonna get whatever comment was
59:21 - previously stored and I'm going to add
59:25 - in a blank line between each comment I
59:29 - do that by doing a backslash N and then
59:33 - I'm going to get the text from this area
59:36 - so I'm gonna say get text and if I click
59:41 - out of here now it will automatically
59:44 - turn those into blocks and now I can
59:47 - pick the ID for this area which is
59:50 - comment input there we go so that's now
59:53 - stored in comment and each time we get a
59:57 - new comment we need to increase our
59:59 - comment count I'm gonna do that here
60:02 - comments count equals comments count +1
60:07 - all right now here's the fun part
60:10 - here's where we get to control our tree
60:13 - and I want to show you page I go here
60:16 - into manage assets you can see that I
60:19 - have a couple trees already uploaded
60:21 - here to show how the tree can grow over
60:24 - time so we're gonna throw in an if
60:27 - statement here I'm gonna choose this one
60:30 - and basically we're gonna say if
60:33 - comments count is over a certain number
60:35 - we're going to show a version of the
60:38 - tree so the first one I want to set is
60:40 - the one that will show the biggest tree
60:43 - so page what's the biggest number you
60:47 - think for the number of comments that
60:49 - should be for the final version of the
60:52 - tree
60:54 - normally I'd say probably like since it
60:57 - takes a couple months to form a habit
60:59 - but we don't have that time so maybe
61:01 - seven perfect and that is exactly what I
61:05 - would say - yeah so normally this might
61:07 - be a couple thousand maybe or a couple
61:10 - hundred but since we're prototyping I
61:12 - don't want to type in a thousand
61:13 - comments to make sure this is working so
61:16 - we're just gonna put in seven and let's
61:18 - actually put in a couple more so I'm
61:20 - just gonna go straight down and say
61:22 - comments count is over six comments
61:29 - count is over five let's do comments
61:33 - count is over four and one more comments
61:40 - count is over three and now we're going
61:42 - to put in our picture images so if I go
61:44 - into the UI controls drawer and I'm
61:47 - going to choose set image URL now drag
61:51 - this over and again I'm going to close
61:53 - down my toolbox so you can see this
61:54 - better and the image here is called tree
61:57 - picture so I'm gonna select tree picture
62:00 - and again the most comments that should
62:03 - get the biggest tree and then the next
62:06 - one I'm gonna actually copy this with
62:09 - command C and then command V I can paste
62:12 - this down here to give me a little bit
62:15 - of a head start here so the next image
62:17 - we're gonna go with tree 5 and then tree
62:22 - 4 and then tree 3 entry to you
62:29 - and finally tree 1 which is just a seed
62:35 - and there we go okay the final thing
62:39 - that we need to do here is we need to
62:42 - make sure that all of these comments are
62:44 - going to get sent over to our journal so
62:49 - I'm going to pick the set text block
62:52 - which is right here and if I go over to
62:58 - my journal screen I can see that this is
63:00 - called Journal output so I'm gonna look
63:03 - for that here it is Journal output
63:06 - and I'm going to use that variable where
63:10 - I stored all of my comments and it will
63:14 - output it there so let's give this a try
63:18 - all right page I need a compliment I
63:22 - really like your glasses there we go and
63:28 - I hit the plus button oh no nothing
63:31 - happened when I clicked the plus button
63:32 - any ideas
63:33 - ooh now it is happening so do you know
63:36 - what happened there Paige why the tree
63:38 - didn't grow the first time I clicked the
63:40 - plus button mm-hmm looking at your code
63:44 - uh-huh
63:47 - would it be that you didn't have an LS
63:51 - for one compliment you only had it for
63:55 - oh wait yeah that's exactly yeah that's
64:00 - exactly it so I had tree one set all the
64:03 - way until I have four comments in and
64:05 - once I get four comments in then it
64:07 - starts showing an image so let's let's
64:10 - actually bump that down a little bit so
64:12 - we can test this out quickly so I'm
64:15 - going to run this I'm going to say I
64:19 - read a book today and we hit plus and I
64:24 - could say I went to the kitchen and ate
64:33 - a really great sandwich and plus I
64:39 - notice it's starting to grow and then
64:41 - the more comments that I added in it
64:43 - would continue to grow and grow and grow
64:46 - and now if I click on the growth journal
64:49 - button it would take me to my journal
64:51 - but we haven't programmed that so let's
64:53 - do that really quick I'm gonna grab my
64:56 - own event again I'm gonna go here and
64:59 - stick it on the bottom and scroll down a
65:04 - little bit and now I'm gonna say when I
65:06 - click on my growth but my growth journal
65:08 - button if my screen does not lock up I'm
65:15 - not sure
65:17 - I think it's locking up a little bit on
65:21 - me and actually see if I can go to text
65:24 - and see if I can fix it that way that
65:28 - works okay so my growth journal button
65:32 - if we remember that's called journal
65:35 - button I'm gonna go back here and I'm
65:37 - gonna type Journal button and by the way
65:41 - what I did just there is one of the fun
65:42 - parts of Apple app at any point I can
65:44 - switch back and forth between blocks and
65:47 - text so when I go to when I click on the
65:52 - journal button I want to switch my
65:54 - screen so I'm going to actually go set
65:56 - screen to the journal screen and also
66:07 - I'm going to make sure that I have it
66:09 - set so that when I click on the home
66:11 - button it's on the journal screen page
66:14 - I'm gonna go to my home screen ok I
66:18 - think we're ready to try this out here
66:21 - we go we're gonna click run and hope for
66:23 - the best
66:24 - so my first compliment or my first
66:26 - comment might be I again I read a book
66:30 - today I I ate an apple I feel confident
66:44 - I can program an app I can be a computer
66:53 - scientist and my tree is growing every
66:58 - time I click on that let's go to my
67:00 - growth journal and now I can see that it
67:02 - is not displaying there maybe it is but
67:05 - the text is actually blue so we need to
67:08 - make sure that in our design we account
67:10 - for that so that our text if you look
67:12 - here text color is the same as our
67:14 - background color the text was there we
67:17 - just couldn't see it so one last quick
67:19 - test here we're just gonna say
67:22 - test test test test test test growth
67:26 - journal and there it is and our journal
67:29 - is populated and we
67:31 - back to our home screen now here's a
67:34 - really great thing actually I'm going to
67:35 - change one quick thing with our text if
67:37 - you notice it was our code every time I
67:39 - typed in here I had to delete my
67:42 - previous thing that I put in here before
67:45 - I could put something else I can make
67:47 - that a lot easier with code if I just
67:51 - put in a new set text down here and I'm
67:58 - going to say set the text for my comment
68:05 - input and I'm gonna set it to a blank
68:07 - string so what this means is when I put
68:12 - a new comment in it's going to reset it
68:14 - to be blank so I'm gonna say test and
68:18 - it's blank test and it's blank go to my
68:22 - growth screen again and our my growth
68:24 - journal it's ready alright this is
68:26 - really great page I really hope that you
68:28 - can take something like this and make it
68:30 - a full app again this is just a
68:32 - prototype but we were able to do this in
68:35 - 10 minutes which is incredible and for
68:37 - all of you at home here's the really fun
68:40 - part I am now going to share this app
68:42 - and I can click on send to phone now you
68:48 - have an option here to send to a u.s.
68:50 - phone number I am NOT going to be able
68:53 - to type in thousands of phone numbers
68:54 - right now that would take way too long
68:56 - so what I'm gonna do is show you how to
68:59 - use this QR code if you have a smart
69:02 - phone nearby you can pick up your smart
69:05 - phone and turn on the camera and hold it
69:08 - up to your screen so I'm gonna do this
69:09 - right here and once I hold it up to the
69:12 - screen I get a pop-up you might get
69:15 - something similar that says open in
69:17 - Safari so I'm going to open it and let
69:21 - it load for a minute and now I have
69:25 - Pages app on my phone and I hope you do
69:28 - too
69:28 - howdy do you have it on your phone okay
69:31 - show you I show the app on their phone
69:34 - so here's a phone that is so great I
69:39 - love it and page this was such a great
69:41 - idea it was really fun to build this
69:42 - with you I hope that you can
69:44 - in you to go with this idea and make it
69:46 - even better and for all of you who are
69:48 - watching we are going to share this app
69:50 - out and you can take it you can remix it
69:53 - you can make it your own you can make
69:56 - something similar please share it back
69:58 - with us using the hashtag code break we
70:00 - really can't wait to see what you make
70:02 - and again congratulations page back to
70:04 - you Hadi and everybody I hope you had a
70:07 - chance to scan that QR code I would say
70:11 - thank you everybody we're basically
70:12 - about to get done I wanted to talk about
70:15 - assignments and homework of challenges
70:17 - that you can do between now and next
70:20 - week we're gonna send you basically
70:23 - assignments or basically these
70:25 - challenges to either make an interactive
70:27 - card for beginners or to make an app or
70:29 - to do both if you want to try if you
70:31 - aren't signed up via email go to code
70:34 - org slash break and enter your email and
70:36 - then share out what you create using
70:39 - hashtag code break also because we're
70:42 - learning prototyping what you're gonna
70:44 - see when you get the email is some
70:46 - printouts that you can print first for
70:48 - an interactive card we want you to
70:50 - prototype the card first and write the
70:52 - behaviors before you jump into the code
70:54 - or if you're making an app design
70:56 - printout to actually make the flow of
70:59 - what screen goes to what so you have
71:01 - different screens that you can draw on
71:03 - throughout and draw out with your
71:05 - handwriting what you want to create like
71:07 - we said today's one for the day is a
71:09 - prototype and it's really important for
71:12 - any software engineer to take notes in
71:14 - advance and plan their code before they
71:16 - jump into it so parents the weekly
71:20 - challenge email is also going to include
71:21 - activities that students can do on a
71:23 - mobile phone and a really fun unplugged
71:25 - activity that teaches computer science
71:27 - without any screen time so if you
71:29 - haven't already signed up get on the
71:31 - mailing list by joining code org slash
71:32 - break lastly if you have any feedback on
71:35 - how we can improve please fill out our
71:37 - survey that's going to be emailed to you
71:39 - if you signed up and if you enjoyed this
71:41 - show please spread the word if each of
71:43 - you invites two other parents and each
71:45 - of them invites two other families and
71:47 - each of them invites two other families
71:48 - will soon have a hundred thousand
71:50 - families here and all of us can learn
71:53 - computer science together I want to
71:54 - switch to the gallery view and unmute
71:57 - as we say goodbye
72:04 - [Music]
72:12 - take a code break we'll see you next
72:14 - week
