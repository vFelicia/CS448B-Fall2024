00:10 - i'm searching for a book at the library
00:12 - the library database shows images of
00:15 - book covers but when i click the book
00:17 - cover it doesn't show me all the
00:19 - information about the book instead i get
00:21 - this
00:23 - how can we fix this
00:25 - the library's database code for a book
00:27 - object doesn't tell java how to print
00:29 - the information about a book
00:31 - the library database could use the
00:33 - accessor methods for the instance
00:34 - variables in the book class to get this
00:36 - information
00:38 - for example we could use the get author
00:40 - method to get the author
00:42 - use the get title method to get the
00:44 - title
00:45 - then the numpages method to get the
00:48 - number of pages
00:50 - but it would be a bit tedious especially
00:52 - for multiple books
00:55 - the object class has a tostring method
00:58 - since it is the parent class of all
01:00 - classes in java this is called
01:02 - automatically every time we print an
01:04 - object
01:06 - the tostring method returns a string
01:09 - so when we use a print statement with an
01:11 - object
01:13 - it prints the string that is returned
01:15 - from automatically calling this method
01:18 - however it's impossible for the object
01:20 - class to know about all the attributes
01:22 - for all of the types of objects we could
01:24 - ever make in java
01:26 - this means the book class in the
01:28 - library's database program needs its own
01:30 - version of the tostring method
01:33 - when we give a child class its own
01:34 - version of a method that is in a parent
01:37 - class we are overriding the method
01:40 - to override a method we have to use the
01:43 - same method signature
01:45 - so for the tostring method we use the
01:47 - same method signature like this
01:52 - now we can specify what information to
01:54 - provide when we want to print an object
01:56 - we start by using the return keyword and
01:59 - then the string we want to return
02:02 - in this case we want to print the title
02:04 - the author
02:06 - and the number of pages when we print a
02:08 - book object
02:10 - since the tostring method is written
02:12 - inside the book class we can use the
02:14 - instance variables in the string we want
02:16 - to return
02:17 - let's create a book object in our tester
02:19 - class
02:21 - this cs book object is a book by
02:24 - code.org
02:25 - called adventures in java lab
02:28 - and it is a hundred pages
02:31 - when i print this book object using a
02:33 - print statement
02:34 - and run my code
02:36 - i get the information about the book
02:40 - java will check the book class first for
02:42 - a tostring method before moving up the
02:44 - hierarchy to the object class
02:47 - since our book class now has a tostring
02:49 - method it automatically calls it to get
02:51 - the string to print
02:53 - which means we don't have to call each
02:55 - accessor method for each book object
02:58 - now that we have a tostring method
03:00 - we can easily print the state of an
03:02 - object to the console
03:05 - see
03:06 - click on the book and it shows all kinds
03:07 - of information
