00:04 - For our new high school course, which teaches
Computer Science Principles, Code.org is about
00:09 - to release a new tool called App Lab.
00:11 - App Lab is a programming environment for students
to make really simple apps.
00:16 - It has a design mode to let you design the
look and feel of your app.
00:19 - You can then write the code either using blocks
or using the JavaScript programming language.
00:23 - And then you can send your app to your phone
in just a matter of seconds.
00:27 - Let's check it out!
00:28 - Hi, I'm Sarah.
00:29 - I'm the Product Manager on Code.org's Computer
Science Principles project, and I'm going
00:35 - to show you design mode of App Lab which is
where I can create the layout for my app without
00:39 - having to know HTML or CSS.
00:42 - The app I'm going to build is--we've been
having a debate in the office on who is the
00:46 - most prolific pop star of our day--Lady Gaga
or Taylor Swift?
00:49 - So I'm going to make an app to let me pick
which one you like best.
00:54 - Hi, I'm Anthony and I worked on a feature
in our workspace where you can transition
00:59 - from blocks to text and back.
01:00 - I started working on App Lab more than half
a year ago.
01:06 - You can build games, build lots of interactive
graphics.
01:10 - So if you like to build animations, connect
up an event for when that button is clicked,
01:16 - I'm going to use the Play Sound command.
01:21 - All the applications you build in App Lab
you can share with friends.
01:25 - I'm going to share with my friend Alice, and
I can just click the share button up here.
01:28 - So, Hi!
01:30 - I am Sarah's friend and she just sent me that
app that she made, and I can play her app
01:36 - right here on my phone.
