00:01 - okay hello this is James guertin from
00:04 - co.org on the chief evangelist for code
00:06 - org and I am I just can't tell you how
00:09 - excited I am to be here today it is
00:11 - Friday we are on day 5 of the hour of
00:14 - code or the cs education week day 5 of
00:17 - doing the RF code and the response has
00:20 - been phenomenal uh we had a stretch goal
00:24 - when we started this week of maybe
00:26 - possibly trying to reach 10 million
00:28 - students by the time the week is over uh
00:30 - and frankly that was an aspirational
00:33 - goal if we'd gotten to 1 million we
00:35 - still would have taught more kids how to
00:36 - program then learns computer science and
00:39 - then tried computer science into the
00:40 - last for three or four years combined
00:42 - instead we not only hit our 10 million
00:44 - goal we actually blew past it we're
00:46 - already at was at 14.1 million students
00:50 - have now done our programming since we
00:52 - started and we're only on day five we're
00:54 - not even done with day five yet still
00:55 - have a weekend ago it's unbelievable we
00:58 - thought maybe who is it 15 million now
01:00 - it looks like we're going to go and
01:01 - beyond that so thank you to everyone's
01:03 - been part of it you haven't yet done
01:05 - your RF coat it's not too late you can
01:07 - still do the RF code you can talk to
01:09 - schools talk to teachers talk to
01:10 - colleagues talk to friends talk to
01:12 - parents talk to your own kids we've got
01:14 - them and do the RF code because this has
01:16 - been such an amazing event we really are
01:19 - changing the future of computer science
01:22 - really because when you think about it
01:23 - every year in this country roughly
01:25 - 70,000 students study and graduate the
01:28 - computer science degree this year right
01:30 - there on this week we're reaching 14
01:32 - million students to try programming if
01:34 - even just well if ten percent of those
01:37 - students decide they want to study
01:38 - computer science that's 1.4 million
01:40 - students if you know it's an amazing set
01:43 - of numbers was thrilled to see the
01:44 - participation we've had obviously
01:46 - code.org does this because we believe
01:47 - computer science is a basic literacy the
01:49 - feature we believe everyone should learn
01:51 - how to program a computer even if you
01:53 - don't want to do and go into it as a
01:54 - full-time career it's still a valuable
01:57 - background ahead because frankly every
01:58 - career out there these days needs
02:00 - computer programming some degree or
02:01 - another they look at the data from the
02:03 - Department of Labor Statistics every
02:05 - single career every single industry now
02:08 - has space for computer scientists and
02:11 - computer programmers and so it's a great
02:13 - deal
02:14 - the theme of our code one the whole
02:16 - reason we're doing this is to send a
02:17 - message that anyone can learn that you
02:19 - do not have to be a math genius you
02:22 - don't have to be a bill gates in order
02:24 - to learn how to program and so by giving
02:25 - this one hour long taste of computer
02:29 - science the hope is it a significant
02:31 - percentage of people who try will decide
02:33 - they want to go on and go further and
02:35 - actually I do this as a career and take
02:38 - a programming professionally so the
02:41 - today's the focus of this chat was going
02:43 - to be an interview with Leo decoder he's
02:46 - gotten a lot of press recently he was
02:49 - formula he's still as homeless but he he
02:53 - reached an unusual agreement with a
02:57 - gentleman New York who got to know him
03:00 - and stop the one day and said look I
03:02 - could give you money i'm willing to give
03:04 - you a hundred bucks cash or i want each
03:06 - other program which would you like and
03:07 - you said I won't limit a program and so
03:09 - he did he went off he learned got a
03:10 - program and he wrote his first
03:12 - application which to publish this week
03:14 - it's a very inspiring story so this is
03:16 - going to be a chat with Leo as a chance
03:18 - to talk about the tools he used uh
03:20 - fitting of a theme of anyone can code
03:22 - unfortunately something come to us
03:24 - minute Lou had to step out and we're not
03:25 - sure if we're going to get them back
03:27 - again in time for this chat so for those
03:29 - of you who are watching live uh my
03:32 - apologies right there that's the that's
03:34 - the office early literally just minutes
03:36 - ago was sitting along with Patrick the
03:38 - gentleman tato had a code and so what I
03:41 - want to do is while we're waiting for
03:43 - him I will let you take your questions
03:45 - about topics other than Leo himself if
03:48 - anyone has any questions about our of
03:49 - code or broad questions would have to
03:52 - take them while we wait and then and
03:55 - then we can go from there it really is i
03:57 - must say to anyone who's watching if
04:00 - you've done the hour of code thank you
04:02 - if you haven't done it yet you really
04:03 - should it's been fantastic and and so
04:07 - yeah so I see a comment here the RF code
04:09 - is awesome thank you very much I think
04:11 - so too I must say it's been the response
04:14 - has been phenomenal we haven't already
04:15 - go to Twitter and n search for the
04:18 - hashtag hour of code and you will see
04:21 - some really inspiring photographs and
04:23 - comments from people from living across
04:25 - the world there are my favorite
04:27 - photographs
04:28 - are these shots of like kindergarten
04:30 - classrooms with like 20 kids lying on
04:32 - their stomachs on the floor surrounding
04:34 - a set of iPads all learning how to code
04:36 - together it's just been great we're
04:37 - hearing reports and teachers who say our
04:39 - kids never collaborate together and now
04:41 - they're actually collaborating to
04:42 - program which has just been amazing so
04:43 - that's just been really fantastic Ike
04:46 - another question here how many total
04:47 - lines of code have been ridden in the
04:49 - hour of code so far yeah it's crazy
04:51 - we've actually had at the exact number
04:53 - now is 450 million lines of code of them
04:57 - written now here computer scientists you
04:58 - know that's kind of a funny statistic
05:00 - because you don't really measure
05:01 - productivity by the number of lines of
05:03 - code written but it is still a useful
05:05 - measurement of this how much activity's
05:07 - been going on and so together all of our
05:09 - students have written 450 million lines
05:11 - of code which is pretty remarkable so
05:13 - that's kind of fun ok so what are the
05:15 - questions we have here I learned how to
05:17 - program a time only nine congratulations
05:19 - that is awesome we have always believed
05:22 - that you do not have to be in high
05:24 - school or in college to learn how to
05:26 - program I learned how to program basic
05:28 - when I was in elementary school I think
05:30 - a lot of the programmers who do this
05:32 - professionally learn the code when they
05:34 - were kids and so that we even data and
05:37 - as you might be skeptical there's even
05:39 - data that shows that people can learn
05:41 - how to program before they can learn how
05:42 - to read presumably not by typing text
05:45 - but by using the visual programming
05:46 - language but the concepts are the same
05:48 - so we think this is a fundamental
05:49 - literacy that is a great skill for the
05:52 - future that's great another question
05:54 - what is next for code Oregon 2014 great
05:57 - question so this hour of code if it was
06:00 - just the hour it would be a marketing
06:03 - stunt it wouldn't really be fun but it
06:05 - wouldn't have a lasting impact the
06:07 - ultimate goal for code org is to get
06:09 - computer science into blew up our
06:12 - ultimate goal is to ensure that every
06:14 - student has the opportunity to learn
06:15 - computer science and so that means
06:17 - number one teaching you right now we
06:20 - need only ten percent of our schools
06:21 - teach computer science ninety percent of
06:23 - our schools don't teach computer science
06:24 - and so our first goal is getting
06:26 - computer science into 100 cyber schools
06:28 - then once we've gotten there the next
06:31 - step is to start working toward getting
06:32 - computer science is part of required to
06:34 - Torah curriculum we're ideally every
06:36 - student in America graduating high
06:38 - school should have at least a year
06:39 - computer science we believe that would
06:40 - be a great
06:41 - to get to they already have that
06:42 - requirement in many countries within the
06:44 - to be requirement here in America as
06:45 - well but that's a longer term goal for
06:46 - now let's just focus on getting computer
06:48 - science into the schools and so next
06:50 - fall we're doing our first pilot program
06:52 - we're working with 100 schools that
06:54 - don't turn the teach computer science to
06:56 - introduce computer science into their
06:57 - curriculum we're also working with
06:58 - school districts around the country to
07:00 - help them introduce computer science so
07:01 - for example Chicago we're partnering
07:03 - with Chicago they just announced on
07:05 - Monday that they're going to be offering
07:06 - computer science in every school in
07:08 - Chicago School District which means in
07:09 - the first school district in the country
07:11 - to make that a goal which is fantastic
07:13 - and we expect to see many more to follow
07:15 - okay next question is the number of cut
07:18 - lines of code written just from the code
07:20 - that our tutorial or from all the other
07:22 - tutorials an answer is just the lines
07:24 - just the code org tutorial we don't have
07:27 - a way of tracking lines of code written
07:28 - across all the tutorials so in fact if
07:31 - you were to add up all the code written
07:32 - across all of our tutorials the number
07:34 - would be a lot higher because we're
07:35 - seeing a lot of activity in code Academy
07:38 - Khan Academy app inventor tinker a
07:41 - lightbox gotten a lot of positive
07:43 - feedback I've heard a lot of great
07:44 - things from a lot of people on all the
07:45 - tutorials we've been offering so yeah
07:47 - that's just the beef or hundred fifty
07:49 - million lines of code is just the hour
07:51 - of code to 12 that we wrote here at
07:53 - code.org okay let's see what else are we
07:56 - planning on making stuff besides games
08:01 - let's right answer that the tutorial
08:03 - that we built ourselves here is it's a
08:07 - it's like a game but really it's
08:09 - teaching computer science and if you go
08:10 - all the way through it it really is a
08:12 - pretty good introduction of computer
08:13 - science but not all the tutorials are
08:15 - like that some of the tutorials for
08:16 - example from the team of processing is
08:18 - actually focusing on using a computer
08:20 - language to create art which is a great
08:21 - activity and there are others so so I
08:27 - encourage you to check out other
08:28 - tutorials they're very different and not
08:30 - all about games in fact only few don't
08:32 - actually our focus on games or game like
08:35 - okay that's it for the questions I've
08:37 - got so far um let's see one thing I
08:41 - would also like to share some
08:43 - interesting statistics from our
08:45 - department of code or statistics not
08:48 - only have we reached now over a 14
08:51 - million students but that is more
08:53 - students uh
08:55 - and have studied programming in the
08:57 - entire history of computer science is
08:58 - that right yes so we've had more
09:00 - students study computer science in past
09:02 - week or so that more students try
09:05 - programming in the past week as far as
09:07 - we can tell have tried programming an
09:08 - entire history of computer science in
09:10 - the US schools which is a superset and
09:12 - if you start looking at example women or
09:15 - minorities like African Americans or
09:17 - Hispanics the numbers even crazier
09:19 - something like more girls and try
09:21 - computer science in the last week then
09:23 - it's like five times more girls of prior
09:26 - to the last week than an entire history
09:27 - of computer programming English schools
09:29 - and and even crazier like 20 X when you
09:32 - should talk about minorities like
09:33 - students of color so that's that's just
09:35 - awesome so that's it that's the update
09:38 - from co.org headquarters here in
09:40 - beautiful Seattle I wish we had a Leo
09:43 - here to join us unfortunately he had to
09:46 - step away and we had some technical
09:48 - snafus that prevented us from starting
09:50 - on time and so my apologies to everyone
09:52 - so if you were here early you're here on
09:54 - time thank you if you missed it uh well
09:57 - and will stream this and hopefully we'll
09:59 - be able to reschedule this chat for
10:01 - later once when so we get them back okay
10:03 - thank you very much thanks for joining
10:05 - in and please again go do hour of code
10:08 - code org you haven't had a chance yet
10:10 - watch the video to really fun video two
10:12 - minutes long you can see that on co.org
10:14 - as well alright thank you and signing
10:16 - off
