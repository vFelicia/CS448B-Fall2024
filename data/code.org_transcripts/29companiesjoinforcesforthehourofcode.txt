00:00 - well staying with tech coding is the new
00:02 - literacy two dozen tech companies are
00:05 - working to make sure more people are
00:07 - equipped Microsoft Google others
00:09 - partnering with code.org it teaches
00:12 - computer science students worldwide and
00:14 - increasing diversity in the programming
00:16 - field Jeff Elder is with me now from The
00:18 - Wall Street Journal so Jeff why what's
00:21 - in it for these big tech
00:24 - companies well diversity has been one of
00:26 - the big issues this year dearra and it's
00:29 - a systemic problem it begins with
00:31 - education and tech companies have said
00:34 - we have to start walking the walk so
00:37 - this is a way for them to band together
00:38 - some of these companies are competitors
00:40 - so it can be difficult for them to work
00:42 - together on something that has to do
00:44 - with their personnel so this is a way
00:46 - for them to commit to take part so at
00:48 - what point Jeff are they getting in the
00:50 - mix I mean are they going with high
00:52 - school students what ages are we talking
00:55 - about well uh code.org aims to get
00:58 - computer science part of a Core
01:00 - Curriculum throughout education the tech
01:03 - company's two dozen big CEOs sent out
01:06 - emails today to all of their employees
01:09 - asking them to participate in this
01:11 - December program to help raise money for
01:14 - schools so they can get this curriculum
01:16 - and to take part in these online
01:18 - tutorials themselves so is it taking off
01:20 - I mean it's one thing for two dozen
01:22 - companies to say to a few exacts okay
01:24 - listen you really should go do this but
01:26 - are you seeing a reaction I mean you're
01:28 - out there in Silicon Valley is there a
01:32 - commitment I do I think it begins with
01:34 - raising awareness deardra and I think
01:37 - people are realizing that computer
01:38 - science is science computer science is
01:41 - math that this can take the place of
01:43 - some core curricula that have been there
01:45 - in the past and be a verifiable part of
01:48 - Education and Training preparation for
01:50 - the workforce Jeff makes sense thank you
01:54 - very much Jeff Elder joining us there
