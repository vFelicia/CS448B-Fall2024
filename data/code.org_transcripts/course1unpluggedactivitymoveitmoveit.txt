00:07 - This lesson is called move it, move it. Together
00:11 - we're going to write a program to get our
friends from the starting spot with the compass
00:15 - rose to the smiley face goal. But the smiley
is face down and only one person knows how
00:26 - to get there. Let's get this program started.
A program is an algorithm that has been coded
00:32 - into something that can be run by a machine.
Most of us think of a program as something
00:38 - that we write for a computer. Programs are
really good for that but they're also helpful
00:42 - in other places. You can make your own game
or even program a robot to do things for you.
