00:03 - welcome to computer science connections
00:05 - modeling animal
00:07 - adaptations this module makes
00:09 - connections between science and computer
00:11 - science specifically it can introduce
00:15 - reinforce or extend any student learning
00:17 - related to animal adaptation if you're
00:20 - teaching about Behavior cause and effect
00:24 - or just want to get your students coding
00:26 - you've come to the right
00:28 - place
00:31 - in this module students will use Sprite
00:33 - lab a block-based programming platform
00:36 - to code an event-based cause and effect
00:39 - model to demonstrate how species Survive
00:43 - by adapting to their environment over
00:46 - time the main computer science Concepts
00:49 - in this module are Sprites events and
00:53 - behaviors a Sprite is something you
00:55 - interact with like a character or an
00:58 - object in a scene each Sprite can have
01:01 - different properties like its
01:03 - costume size and location in coding
01:08 - there are cause and effect relationships
01:10 - we trigger with events an event is an
01:12 - action that tells a specific chunk of
01:15 - code to run events allow us to change
01:19 - our programs in real time for example by
01:22 - assigning a spin right Behavior with a
01:25 - mouse click event we can command this
01:28 - hamburger to spin to the the right when
01:30 - it is clicked behaviors are actions that
01:34 - happen over and over while the program
01:37 - runs students will use behaviors in
01:40 - computer science to represent animal
01:42 - survival behaviors they will give their
01:45 - Sprites a set of instructions to execute
01:47 - over and over like an
01:53 - animation there are three lessons in
01:56 - this module in lesson one students
01:58 - explore examples of evolution
02:00 - adaptation migration natural selection
02:04 - and survival in
02:09 - groups in lesson two students will Model
02:12 - Behavior adaptations by using events to
02:14 - trigger multiple behaviors as well as
02:17 - using new properties like a Sprite size
02:20 - and
02:24 - speed in the third and final lesson
02:26 - students learn how to edit animal
02:29 - behavior in code students will make a
02:31 - prediction about a fox's mystery
02:33 - Behavior use the edit button to debug
02:37 - different animal parameters like speed
02:40 - and direction to complete the lesson
02:43 - students will choose an environmental
02:45 - change scenario use their own creative
02:48 - code to model a new and unique animal
02:51 - adaptation and share their behaviors
02:54 - with their
02:57 - peers a student might might encounter a
03:00 - bug if their Sprite costume selections
03:02 - are inconsistent have students double
03:05 - check that they've selected the correct
03:07 - costume to call the intended Sprite in
03:10 - this example the coder wants the parrot
03:12 - Sprite to dance when the program is run
03:16 - however the coder mistakenly assigned
03:18 - the eagle Sprite to dance because there
03:20 - is no Eagle in the play Space users will
03:23 - not be able to see any Sprite dance to
03:26 - debug change the eagle Sprite to the
03:29 - parrot right in the
03:35 - block often students try to snap a green
03:38 - event block under the win run block but
03:41 - this will not work the event block
03:44 - stands on its own and any code added to
03:46 - it will run when the event is triggered
03:49 - encourage students to frequently test
03:51 - their code they will need to press run
03:54 - then use the play Space to trigger the
03:58 - event
04:01 - it can be easy for students on laptops
04:03 - to miss part of the instructions because
04:06 - the panels are small reminding them to
04:09 - expand the instruction panel down will
04:12 - allow students to see all of the
04:18 - steps if a student gets confused after
04:21 - making several changes in their code it
04:23 - is easy to reset the level and start
04:27 - blocks just click version history and
04:30 - then start over to reset just the level
04:34 - there
04:37 - on in every lesson plan discussion
04:40 - questions are coupled with discussion
04:42 - goals check for understanding and
04:44 - promote student Reflection by
04:46 - incorporating these discussion questions
04:48 - into your
04:53 - teaching review the concepts of
04:55 - adaptations camouflage Evolution and
04:58 - migration with with your students use
05:01 - the provided slideshow to introduce
05:03 - these Concepts and teach the vocabulary
05:06 - within the context of the
05:11 - lesson this module is aligned with ngss
05:14 - and the computer science Teachers
05:16 - Association standards in order to align
05:19 - to the concepts you already teach to
05:22 - help you think of ways to integrate ask
05:24 - yourself how might this module support
05:27 - the content I'm already teaching and
05:30 - should I use this module to introduce
05:33 - reinforce or extend student learning on
05:35 - this
05:39 - topic don't forget about the hide and
05:41 - show feature for each lesson it's best
05:44 - practice to only show the lesson
05:46 - students are currently working on if you
05:48 - do not hide the following lessons
05:50 - students will be moved to the next
05:52 - lesson
05:56 - automatically before teaching the module
05:58 - complete each coding level on your own
06:01 - you can write your own code as an
06:03 - example for students make sure to review
06:06 - the lesson plans and additional
06:08 - resources code.org provides resources
06:11 - like slides student handouts and helpful
06:14 - hints to help you and your students get
