00:00 - hey class today we are going to be in
00:01 - explore lessons students learn a new
00:03 - concept through a teacher-led
00:06 - hands-on group activity
00:08 - the goal of explore lessons is for
00:10 - students to develop a shared mental
00:13 - model
00:14 - of a new programming concept a mental
00:16 - model is a representation of how
00:18 - something works
00:20 - frequently mental models will build over
00:22 - time throughout the course
00:24 - for example a mental model of a variable
00:27 - will be used to develop a mental model
00:29 - of a list
00:30 - in later lessons
00:32 - explore lessons typically use physical
00:35 - manipulatives
00:36 - visual slides and activity guides linked
00:39 - in the lesson plan
00:41 - to prepare for the lesson first take a
00:44 - look at the lesson plan and the slides
00:46 - provided
00:47 - some teachers find it helpful to print
00:49 - out the lesson plan and use it as a
00:51 - reference while teaching the lesson
00:53 - itself
00:55 - before you teach the lesson it can be
00:57 - helpful for you to use the manipulatives
00:59 - to act out the prompts from the lesson
01:03 - explore lessons start with a short
01:05 - prompt or activity to grab students
01:07 - interests and activate their prior
01:09 - knowledge
01:12 - from there you will introduce the new
01:14 - concept using manipulatives or an
01:16 - activity guide
01:18 - often the activity alternates between
01:19 - the teacher giving short explanations
01:22 - and students completing the tasks using
01:24 - manipulatives
01:27 - these tasks are collaborative as
01:29 - students are working
01:31 - circulate the room to listen to
01:32 - conversations
01:34 - and see if you identify any
01:35 - misconceptions hey
01:37 - all right i'm noticing you have two
01:40 - stickies in the same baggie common
01:42 - misconception this can't happen
01:44 - baggy can only hold one sticky so what i
01:46 - want you two to do is as partners is
01:48 - look up there try to figure out what
01:50 - line of code you think that happened on
01:52 - but you only want one sticky in the
01:54 - baggie
01:55 - all good okay cool yeah you got it
01:58 - when they're stuck encourage students to
02:00 - explain their thinking using the
02:02 - manipulatives
02:04 - all right class great job today i have
02:06 - some vocabulary so why don't we go and
02:09 - add these to our journals
02:11 - explore lessons typically end with
02:13 - students adding new vocabulary or
02:15 - concepts to their journals
02:18 - sometimes code may be referenced in an
02:20 - explore lesson but students don't need
02:22 - to know how to use it on their own yet
02:25 - the two most important parts of an
02:27 - explore lesson are to build a shared
02:29 - mental model and to introduce key
02:31 - vocabulary
02:34 - you and your students will refer back to
02:35 - this mental model in the upcoming
02:37 - investigate practice and make lessons
