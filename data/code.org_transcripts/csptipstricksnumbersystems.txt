00:04 - this lesson is about number systems the
00:06 - decimal number system that we're all
00:08 - taught in school has 10 symbols to
00:10 - represent numbers 0 through 9 but what
00:13 - if our number system only had two
00:15 - symbols to represent number what about
00:18 - 16 symbols it turns out that the concept
00:21 - of a number and the symbols you use to
00:23 - represent them is somewhat arbitrary and
00:26 - more abstract than you might
00:28 - think up to now we've represented
00:30 - information using combinations of two
00:33 - states A and B we've combined these
00:36 - states in a variety of ways but without
00:38 - any particular order or protocol in this
00:41 - lesson we make the bridge to the binary
00:43 - number system and other number systems
00:45 - by exam examining properties of all the
00:48 - number systems number systems are
00:50 - defined by their base or how many
00:52 - different symbols there are so the
00:54 - decimal number system with 10 symbols
00:56 - for numbers is called a base 10 number
00:59 - system in computer science we most
01:01 - frequently use binary which is a base 2
01:04 - number system decimal which like I said
01:07 - is base 10 and a hexadecimal which is
01:09 - base 16 the Cs principles framework
01:11 - discusses numbers in their
01:12 - representations under Big Ideas
01:14 - abstraction and
01:17 - programming at the most primitive level
01:19 - all data inside of a computer must be
01:21 - represented as combinations of binary
01:24 - States a great challenge of computing is
01:26 - to find ways to represent different
01:28 - kinds of information as numbers
01:30 - if you can figure out a way to represent
01:32 - it as a number then you can store it in
01:33 - a computer so to get started I'd like
01:36 - you to flip your worksheets over and on
01:38 - the back I would like you to represent
01:42 - seven in as many ways as you can in the
01:45 - warm-up activity we had students think
01:48 - about how many different ways they can
01:50 - write out and represent the number seven
01:52 - the purpose of this activity is to show
01:54 - that representation of a number is an
01:56 - arbitrary choice and it doesn't change
01:58 - the fact about the underlying inform
02:00 - inform if I'm trying to say that there
02:02 - are seven apples on the table I could
02:03 - write seven as the number seven I could
02:05 - write out the word seven I could write
02:07 - the r a numeral seven and that doesn't
02:09 - change the fact that there are seven
02:11 - apples from here we transition to
02:13 - working with a set of three shapes some
02:15 - red circles you have some green
02:18 - triangles and you have some blue squares
02:21 - to try and make a number system out of
02:23 - them we first have to discover how many
02:25 - three symbol groupings there are and try
02:27 - to put them in a logical and predictive
02:29 - order
02:30 - I want you to change the last Circle the
02:33 - third circle to a different
02:37 - shape the lesson concludes by
02:39 - recognizing that the circle triangle and
02:40 - square shapes are just arbitrary symbols
02:43 - and that we can easily turn them into a
02:44 - number system with all of the familiar
02:47 - properties of the systems that we're
02:49 - used to for example if the problem had
02:51 - 10 shapes and we mapped each one of
02:53 - those to the digits 0 through 9 it would
02:55 - be really obvious how to count when
02:58 - we've only got three symbols it takes a
02:59 - little still getting used to but the
03:00 - number system operates in the same way
03:03 - it would probably be helpful if in your
03:05 - partner one person is the Scribe and is
03:08 - writing down the ordering that you're
03:10 - making and the other person actually
03:12 - goes through and does the
03:14 - arranging because you want to record it
03:16 - as you go at some point you'll have to
03:17 - reset and start reusing your
03:19 - pieces so continue this pattern where
03:23 - you keep changing just one shape and do
03:26 - that until you get all the way through
03:28 - and you've represented as many shapes as
03:29 - you can wait triangle triangle square
03:31 - have we done that yet okay there we go
03:33 - do square square square triangle
03:36 - circle is it important to have a
03:39 - predictable 18 it's not a number system
03:43 - if it's just a jumble of symbols you
03:45 - have to have rules that let you get from
03:47 - the start to somewhere further along the
03:50 - number system in an incremental way not
03:53 - in a pseudo random way as a helpful tool
03:56 - the odometer widget can be used in the
03:58 - lesson and in the course more broadly to
04:00 - help visualize number systems and
04:02 - different bases this is going to roll
04:05 - over to
04:07 - 18 so we drive one mile now it's 018
04:11 - this is a brand new car by the way
04:12 - because your parents only have 18 miles
04:14 - on it both students who self-identify as
04:16 - bad at math and those who don't might
04:18 - find many of their assumptions about
04:20 - numbers are challenged in this lesson
04:23 - and they might begin to become
04:25 - frustrated remind students that computer
04:27 - science is not a math class and we're
04:30 - what we're doing here is looking for
04:31 - patterns order and logical systems
04:34 - working with abstract symbols at its
04:36 - core is the work of computer
04:39 - science some students might recognize
04:41 - early on that three symbols and three
04:43 - place values means that there are 27
04:46 - possible
04:47 - combinations encourage them still to
04:49 - write them all out as defining a logical
04:51 - order ordering will still be a challenge
04:54 - for them it's not essential that their
04:56 - system for ordering the patterns mimic
04:58 - normal counting system
05:00 - there are many creative ways to do it
05:01 - and this type of concept invention by
05:03 - students should be encouraged you're
05:05 - like oh well if we had that one left we
05:07 - could use it down here to transition to
05:09 - the next shape when using the circle
05:11 - triangle and the square students might
05:13 - not see the connection to num number
05:15 - systems and struggle particularly when
05:17 - it comes to developing and ordering for
05:19 - the symbols but it's a good struggle
05:21 - because it's important that they make
05:23 - some of these discoveries on their own
05:26 - try to keep their focus on looking for
05:27 - patterns and developing systematic rules
05:30 - that can describe how to get from one
05:32 - set of symbols to the next and to test
05:34 - that out with their
05:35 - partner after this lesson we're going to
05:38 - transition into using binary numbers
05:40 - which are base 2 as well as the
05:42 - hexadecimal number system which is base
05:44 - 16 a common Mis misconception is that
05:47 - binary is zeros and ones after this
05:49 - lesson we know a a slight difference on
05:52 - that and binary just means that there
05:53 - are two symbols and it is a number
05:56 - system so we happen to use zeros and
05:58 - ones in common practice because they're
06:01 - easy to write but we could use icons of
06:03 - giraffes and ponies to communicate the
06:04 - same information this is an important
06:07 - example of abstraction that you can
06:08 - really emphasize to your
06:10 - students
