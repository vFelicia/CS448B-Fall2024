02:51 - student interactions serve to shape
02:53 - learning opportunities
02:54 - dr brown's work in science education in
02:57 - urban communities focuses on developing
03:00 - collaborative curricular cycles and
03:02 - classroom pedagogy
03:04 - and dr brown's recent work explores how
03:06 - race language and cultural impacts
03:08 - students learning in urban science
03:10 - classrooms
03:12 - lastly i would like to introduce our
03:14 - code.org ceo heidi petrovi who will then
03:17 - share his welcome address
03:19 - heidi is a tech entrepreneur and
03:21 - investor born in iran
03:23 - heidi grew up during the iran-iraq war
03:25 - he did not
03:27 - his school did not offer computer
03:28 - science classes so he taught himself to
03:30 - code at home on a commodore 64.
03:33 - after immigrating to the united states
03:35 - he spent his summers working as a
03:37 - software engineer to help pay his way
03:39 - through high school and college
03:41 - heidi graduated from harvard university
03:42 - with a master's degree in computer
03:44 - science and pursued a career in
03:45 - technology starting at microsoft before
03:48 - creating code.org in 2016.
03:51 - today hottie leads a team of nearly 100
03:53 - members to ensure access to computer
03:56 - science by every student
03:58 - welcome hottie
04:01 - thank you so much good morning i'm going
04:03 - to keep my comments really short so we
04:04 - can get into the panel on behalf of
04:06 - code.org i want to extend a warm welcome
04:09 - to our panelists trish rashad and dr
04:11 - brown
04:12 - at the current representation of black
04:14 - students and black teachers
04:16 - in k-12 computer science although it's
04:19 - been steadily growing for the last eight
04:20 - years
04:21 - is still far from balanced and the gap
04:24 - is there not only because of the unequal
04:26 - access to computer science courses but
04:28 - also because the challenges of
04:29 - recruiting and retaining students and
04:31 - talent in the field of computer science
04:34 - at code.org we're committed to ensuring
04:36 - access to computer science to all
04:37 - students with a special focus on closing
04:40 - gaps and broadening participation among
04:42 - unrepresented youth
04:43 - as we hopefully and i'm going to knock
04:45 - on wood as we hopefully start closing
04:47 - the chapter on this terrible pandemic we
04:50 - all recognize that the pandemic has
04:52 - widened the digital divide among
04:53 - marginalized populations making this
04:56 - work
04:57 - more important than ever and so if you
04:58 - think about what school year 2022 is
05:01 - going to look like what could we do to
05:03 - not only make back the ground that we
05:05 - lost from the pandemic but then do more
05:08 - to even close gaps
05:11 - we're so delighted to have you here with
05:12 - us i'm eager to hear more about your
05:13 - insight on this important topic so once
05:15 - again welcome to our panel and thank you
05:17 - leoland and sabine and i'll let you all
05:19 - take it off from here
05:22 - thank you so much hattie for your
05:23 - welcome
05:24 - and panelists like we said before thank
05:26 - you all so much for being here
05:28 - as sabine has said the aim of this first
05:30 - panel is to continue to explore the why
05:32 - for recruiting black students and
05:33 - teachers into computer science education
05:37 - so recently our chief academic officer
05:39 - shared a gallup study stating that 78 of
05:42 - black parents and guardians agree that
05:44 - learning computer science is important
05:47 - however our data also shows black
05:49 - students who represent 15 percent of the
05:52 - national student demographics account
05:54 - for only 5 percent of those taking the
05:56 - ap computer science exam
05:58 - these numbers are important place to
06:00 - start and display the reality of the
06:02 - representation of black students in high
06:04 - school cs education
06:06 - parents are clearly curious and engaged
06:08 - but this interest is not reflected in
06:10 - the numbers of students moving forward
06:12 - with ap computer science so trish we'll
06:14 - start with you
06:16 - can you start us off and share why we
06:17 - should be concerned about this disparity
06:19 - shared in these numbers and how has this
06:21 - impacted your mission at taft
06:24 - well yeah i think we should care about
06:26 - it i think the the important thing
06:28 - though is
06:30 - for us to realize that our public school
06:32 - systems were never built
06:34 - for black students
06:36 - and so we are trying to fit
06:38 - black students into a structure that was
06:42 - not designed for them period so when you
06:44 - look at
06:45 - schools that offer ap classes
06:49 - it's hard to get students black students
06:51 - into
06:52 - ap computer science right i mean ap
06:56 - world government
06:58 - and
06:59 - english and all those things so we
07:00 - certainly are not going to get them
07:03 - into ap computer science because they
07:05 - already know that those classes are not
07:08 - meant for them so but when you look at a
07:10 - school that's majority
07:12 - of students of color
07:14 - they don't even have that array of
07:16 - classes so it's about availability when
07:19 - i look at the work we do what we focus
07:21 - on mostly
07:23 - is around giving kids those core stem
07:25 - skills that they need
07:27 - um
07:28 - critical thinking problem solving being
07:30 - able to ideate communicate
07:32 - um and uh create community for whatever
07:36 - it is they do and the way we introduce
07:39 - computer science is um
07:42 - is through projects so we're a
07:43 - project-based learning model and so all
07:46 - of our students so it's not if you want
07:48 - to
07:49 - it's all of our students take those
07:51 - classes right that's one of the the
07:54 - issues that we have we have
07:56 - some classes for some kids and some from
07:58 - other for others in our traditional
08:00 - public schools and the way we get around
08:02 - it is saying that this is a requirement
08:04 - for everybody and if you actually like
08:06 - programming
08:08 - after you've taken it through your math
08:10 - class if you actually like it then we
08:12 - provide a mechanism for you to even
08:14 - explore it further
08:16 - but the whole goal is to get everybody's
08:19 - feet wet in it and not make it an option
08:28 - dr brown our brother's brother
08:30 - feel free to
08:31 - jump in as well
08:33 - i'm happy to to to add to that idea and
08:36 - i i want to point to the infrastructure
08:39 - meaning
08:40 - what are we really talented at the us is
08:43 - leading the world in basketball the u.s
08:46 - is leading the world in football
08:48 - you can find someone to teach you how to
08:50 - play basketball there's a basketball
08:52 - court in every school
08:54 - a ball available at any time if i'm
08:56 - interested in learning about code
08:59 - if i'm fortunate enough that my school
09:01 - offers something i need a computer that
09:04 - has the access to engage and i need the
09:06 - expert so we're suffering from real
09:08 - infrastructure so let's start at one
09:10 - level we need the teachers and i'm not
09:13 - talking about the teachers in school
09:14 - because we have an irrational
09:16 - expectation that an elementary school
09:18 - teacher who's teaching because they love
09:20 - kids is now going to be a expert at
09:23 - science
09:24 - math history english and oh by the way
09:27 - let's add computer science yeah we need
09:29 - to train
09:30 - an infrastructure that gives us a wealth
09:33 - of computer science educators now here's
09:35 - let's live in the real world
09:37 - if i know cs and i can code i can go
09:40 - make 60 000 as a as a teacher or i can
09:43 - make 150 working for some company or
09:46 - well beyond that right so what's the
09:49 - incentive to to embed
09:51 - a structure that provides students
09:53 - access this is the last thing i'll say
09:55 - we have an opportunity in front of us um
09:57 - those of you have children like i had
09:59 - children um the way that our work system
10:01 - is structured is we're working until 5
10:03 - 30. our kids get out of school at 3 15.
10:06 - so you tell me what are we doing between
10:07 - the hours of 3 15
10:09 - and when parents are available to
10:12 - to to pick their kids up you know
10:14 - there's an entire
10:16 - opportunity there in between those hours
10:18 - to embed after school structures that
10:21 - really empower young people to learn and
10:22 - learn early but it requires us to teach
10:25 - the teachers
10:27 - and dr brown man you you hit right on
10:29 - the head i was just gonna add my um my
10:32 - way of engagement and what i've seen in
10:33 - the schools as well i remember being in
10:35 - a particular school in washington state
10:38 - and walking through and having to go and
10:41 - um give information around the college
10:43 - that i work for and when i'm going into
10:45 - these classrooms
10:46 - i'm seeing nothing but um our white and
10:49 - asian students and i see none of my
10:50 - black and brown students but in the
10:52 - lunchroom during lunch when i was there
10:54 - they're all around sitting around but
10:56 - they're not in that college
10:58 - going um classroom where i'm introducing
11:01 - what programs and so forth we have at
11:03 - the particular college at highline and
11:05 - and while while i'm in there i go and
11:08 - ask the teacher i said man where's my
11:09 - black and brown students at and and i
11:12 - asked her like did they get the invite
11:14 - as well and she tells me that you know
11:16 - she gave it to all the seniors the
11:19 - senior english classes that's who she
11:21 - invited so then i go back and i said
11:23 - well well you're telling me that there's
11:25 - no black and brown babies in the senior
11:27 - classes in english classes and then she
11:30 - actually shows me the report from her
11:33 - school and shows that none of those
11:35 - black and brown babies were in senior
11:37 - english classes none of them so i'm
11:39 - still thinking like men how else are we
11:42 - getting the information to our black and
11:43 - brown babies if they're not even in
11:45 - particular classes that are getting all
11:47 - this information pertaining to certain
11:49 - fields and certain programs so i go to
11:52 - the students and i asked him hey why are
11:54 - you not in senior classes senior english
11:57 - classes
11:58 - and one of them said this and it hurt my
12:00 - heart and they said well i don't need a
12:02 - foreign language and i said no no no no
12:04 - young man that has nothing to do with
12:05 - this
12:06 - like for you to even
12:08 - why are you even answering this question
12:10 - like this what why how does this answer
12:12 - come out and we still allow you to just
12:15 - pass through these quantities school
12:17 - without you knowing that you need senior
12:19 - english like this is so this is a
12:21 - tragedy that we're having right now in
12:23 - these schools and sister trish is right
12:25 - on you know we're we're trying to put a
12:28 - square in a circle you know that's just
12:30 - tough it wasn't meant for us in the
12:32 - first place so now we're trying to say
12:34 - please not just not integrate let's
12:36 - collaborate let's do that now and that's
12:38 - a whole different step that's that's a
12:40 - whole tear down and we build it together
12:43 - you know what i'm saying so now we're
12:44 - talking about collaboration right now
12:45 - we're talking about integrating and just
12:47 - helping us put some program in so we
12:49 - just got to be real with this this is
12:51 - going to be a tough uh the tough feat
12:53 - but you know i think it could be do it's
12:54 - doable and i i love your idea dr brown
12:57 - you're right i think we need to make our
12:59 - own institution
13:01 - mm-hmm
13:02 - yeah you're not wrong
13:05 - are not wrong i mean we're trying to put
13:07 - a band-aid on the system
13:09 - that needs just to be torn down and
13:11 - rebuilt
13:13 - uh with the focus on on voice and choice
13:15 - of students all the students
13:18 - um right now it's just you know we put
13:20 - one band-aid in after another first it
13:23 - was math everybody needs to be better at
13:25 - math so let's bring in some google fancy
13:28 - online math programs like that's gonna
13:30 - make a difference right now we're
13:32 - talking about everybody needs computer
13:33 - science well what we're doing there is
13:36 - we're actually widening the gap
13:38 - national science foundation about six or
13:41 - seven years ago i was at a conference
13:42 - there and they were talking about how
13:44 - the previous 20 years of work
13:47 - to get more kids of color and more girls
13:50 - um into computer science actually widen
13:53 - the gap because people were afraid to
13:55 - talk about
13:56 - we are specifically targeting kids of
13:58 - color
13:59 - specifically underrepresented kids of
14:01 - color and so then they would just open
14:03 - up the programs they had to everybody
14:06 - and now who's going to come the same
14:08 - people who always come right because
14:10 - they're the ones who get the information
14:12 - first they're the ones who have the
14:14 - family structure and the income
14:16 - structure that can get them there first
14:18 - and so now we're widening the gap so
14:20 - this whole thing in washington state and
14:22 - i don't know if it's true anywhere else
14:24 - about this computer science for all
14:27 - is widening the gap because there's no
14:29 - money mandate behind that that says
14:31 - every single school needs to now have
14:33 - enough equipment um to brother brown's
14:37 - point enough equipment enough
14:39 - infrastructure and all that to make it
14:41 - happen they're just saying make it
14:42 - happen i didn't sign on to that
14:45 - you know i mean that's just crazy we
14:48 - need to think of a better way to do that
14:52 - to add to that i think we need to kind
14:55 - of in the spirit of wisdom look
14:56 - backwards to say well if people are
14:59 - thriving in new industries where are
15:02 - african-americans thriving in industries
15:04 - that are emerging so if i take
15:06 - engineering and say well where are those
15:08 - who are getting the most degrees in
15:09 - engineering coming from well that answer
15:11 - north carolina's a t university
15:13 - historically black college and
15:14 - university so
15:16 - it's not that they have some secrets off
15:18 - the question is what is happening in
15:20 - that institution that's producing these
15:21 - outcomes if i go to look at biomedical
15:24 - research um the leading institution
15:26 - right now and graduating phds or seeing
15:29 - posds one of those is the university of
15:31 - maryland baltimore county where freeman
15:33 - hebrowski has created a specific program
15:35 - to empower the students and here's one
15:37 - thing that they that they share in
15:38 - common this is part of what my research
15:40 - works on is if i'm at north carolina a t
15:42 - and i'm in a classroom and i'm learning
15:44 - code i am not questioning whether or not
15:47 - i should be here whether or not people
15:49 - like myself are involved in the the uh
15:52 - in the coding community and why that's
15:54 - important is the psychology of
15:55 - performance
15:56 - there are studies that say if i have
15:58 - doubt about who i am and i encounter
16:00 - something that's difficult i'll then say
16:02 - you know what i shouldn't be here
16:04 - if
16:05 - i have a history that says i i'm not
16:08 - supposed to be part of this group but
16:09 - the inverse is if i'm no i'm supposed to
16:11 - be part of the group it's just difficult
16:13 - and i will get through it because i will
16:15 - get through it so the question is when
16:17 - you think about building a generation of
16:19 - computer scientists where are those
16:21 - schools that say
16:23 - all right we're going to focus on
16:24 - computer science and give early access
16:27 - to african americans and understand
16:29 - understandably saying let's focus on
16:31 - getting them teachers who look like them
16:33 - let's make sure we have access to
16:35 - computers unless do often do well
16:37 - meaning this it's not complicated any
16:40 - skill that is mastered is one that is
16:41 - practiced every day for years at a time
16:44 - so we're over complicating it by trying
16:47 - to change an infrastructure well we
16:48 - don't need permissions to take over one
16:51 - institution one school and we need to
16:53 - look historically at where that success
16:55 - was found and it is found in
16:56 - institutions where the identity politics
16:59 - are reduced because we affirm who people
17:01 - are and this crosses gender if you want
17:03 - to look at women physicists
17:05 - the majority of them at large volumes
17:07 - are coming from female only institutions
17:10 - and we need to look at that kind of
17:12 - focus and say how does this translate
17:13 - over to computer science i will offer a
17:15 - critique and here's a critique those in
17:17 - computer science have failed to even
17:20 - delve into the education research to
17:22 - find out what have educated educational
17:24 - researchers in schools done that works
17:26 - and let's translate this over to
17:28 - computer science
17:31 - go ahead i'll let you asking that's
17:32 - another question because that's not
17:33 - gonna be just about to be stuck for me
17:39 - no go ahead go ahead because i had
17:40 - somebody go ahead go ahead go ahead
17:42 - really great um
17:44 - i will make a comment as you all are
17:45 - talking about um
17:48 - where students are coming from that are
17:50 - succeeding and the importance of seeing
17:52 - yourself
17:54 - in these roles i will share a story that
17:56 - i always tell when i'm on panels talking
17:58 - about
17:59 - my experience with computer science i
18:00 - went to university of illinois in
18:02 - urbana-champaign which is a well-known
18:04 - uh engineering school
18:06 - and i won't say it with the year but
18:07 - i'll just say that was the year that
18:08 - those really cool mac computers that had
18:10 - the color on the back those big ones
18:12 - first
18:14 - and my mom i was a freshman my mom was
18:16 - like huh i think that computers are
18:18 - going to be a big thing you should maybe
18:20 - you should major in that and my first
18:21 - thing was like mom that's for white men
18:23 - i'm not i'm not doing that and went a
18:25 - whole different
18:26 - different pathways so it wasn't about me
18:29 - i knew i was smart i was at this great
18:31 - school but that little thing of i didn't
18:33 - see myself in that world
18:36 - and i made that quick decision to just
18:38 - not even not even
18:40 - think of going into it so
18:42 - thank you um dr brown you have started
18:44 - talking about it already so it kind of
18:46 - leads into our next question that we had
18:48 - what the conversation is happening
18:49 - already and specifically those um that
18:52 - data that we shared at the beginning
18:55 - how can we create the sense of urgency
18:56 - or what can we do um to help with
19:00 - teachers and getting teachers educated
19:02 - who may not be already in this field i'm
19:04 - not sure if you know but for code.org
19:07 - our pd are for teachers who have no
19:09 - experience in computer science so those
19:10 - are those teachers you're talking about
19:11 - how do we get them
19:13 - um set up for success
19:16 - well let me let me offer a paradigm
19:19 - redirection um i don't pretend to be
19:21 - normal in that sense that i think a
19:23 - paradigm has to shift and here's the
19:25 - paradigm i don't want a teacher to add
19:28 - it to the curriculum i don't want a
19:30 - school to add it to the curriculum i
19:33 - would love code.org to say you know what
19:35 - we're going to offer free computer
19:37 - science training from three to six from
19:38 - grades three to eight for every
19:40 - elementary school in the state of
19:42 - washington and when that works well
19:44 - we'll move to california and we'll move
19:46 - to texas like
19:47 - do it for them because the fiscal
19:50 - infrastructure of schools doesn't
19:52 - provide teachers with the opportunity to
19:54 - make a reasonable decision so think
19:56 - about it
19:57 - i don't know the data of a person who's
19:59 - who learns a coding language
20:02 - i do know people who learn coding
20:04 - languages as second jobs switching
20:07 - careers
20:08 - inevitably they have moved out of
20:10 - schools into the professional world of
20:13 - tech companies and this is a bay area
20:15 - phenomena so
20:16 - i love the idea of training the trainer
20:18 - but we need to rethink the paradigm all
20:20 - together because adding something to a
20:23 - school is adding an additional burden
20:25 - now going to the questions i'm trying to
20:26 - answer the question the question is
20:29 - how do we build this generation of
20:30 - teachers well we have to build an
20:32 - infrastructure that supports them
20:34 - because people teach because they love
20:35 - kids they don't love subject matters
20:37 - and i think that's where that's that is
20:39 - the thing that i think is lost often a
20:41 - person who loves kids is going to spend
20:43 - their career teaching and they may teach
20:45 - computer science because they think it's
20:46 - interesting but i don't think a person
20:48 - who who loves
20:50 - computer science will do that work so
20:52 - let me offer the other i'm a proponent
20:55 - that providing kids opportunities to be
20:57 - producers will change the paradigm right
21:00 - so the minute kids shift their their
21:02 - thought from saying hey i'm a consumer
21:05 - of technology too i get to produce my
21:07 - own i think
21:08 - then you'll see a huge shift and we're
21:10 - seeing it now kids making their own
21:11 - games their own websites their own
21:13 - businesses i'm actually more encouraged
21:15 - than i am discouraged about how
21:17 - african-americans are engaging in
21:19 - computer science and and let me add to
21:22 - that because you know um dr brown you
21:24 - make a good point you said something
21:26 - earlier around athletes and how we're
21:28 - entertainers and so forth and
21:30 - you know i read this interesting um
21:32 - statistic around
21:34 - black folk um in america taking up maybe
21:38 - i don't want to i don't know the
21:39 - percentage but i know it's a high
21:40 - percentage of social services jobs like
21:43 - a lot of our kids do see us doing social
21:45 - service jobs always trying to help
21:48 - somewhere around that line so
21:51 - you know i i continue to to to ponder
21:54 - and just think that you know you could
21:56 - you continue to see those type of
21:58 - positions and you see us in the way that
22:00 - we come in those positions oftentimes is
22:02 - almost like you know sluggish you know
22:05 - not wanting to do it either you know we
22:07 - we we're trying to get them go to
22:09 - another position that we don't see
22:10 - ourselves in you know so if i don't see
22:13 - nobody who is in cs programming or don't
22:15 - know how am i trying to put somebody to
22:18 - tell them they should go do this as well
22:20 - especially if they're seeing you more
22:21 - often than than anybody else that you're
22:24 - you wanted them to go and be so i would
22:28 - take it as far as saying that some of
22:30 - our coaches a lot of our coaches we need
22:32 - to expand our athletic scope and we need
22:34 - to span the holistic scope of that
22:36 - athlete and start to include some of
22:39 - these things inside these practices even
22:41 - if it's not a true practice may be
22:43 - included on a day that you work with
22:44 - your student athlete and let them know
22:46 - the importance of expanding their scope
22:49 - of wanting to be and and the skill set
22:51 - that they have to be successful in
22:53 - fields like this so i think that there's
22:55 - multiple ways that we can go at this and
22:58 - i think there's different agents that
23:00 - can play a part of it and i think that
23:02 - it will work if we just start to expand
23:05 - the way we present this information to
23:06 - our young people and let them know that
23:08 - this is a possible field for you to go
23:10 - into and most of my outreach skill sets
23:13 - and the strategies that i use you know
23:15 - it comes from edward nichols and he
23:17 - talks about the philosophical aspects of
23:19 - cultural differences and he talks about
23:21 - how we as black and brown folk we need
23:24 - to see images we need to see some type
23:26 - of there needs to be a rhythm with what
23:28 - you're giving me there needs to be
23:29 - something that i i can fill it inside i
23:33 - can see it i can feel it it represents
23:35 - me and not only do i see it that one
23:37 - time but i see it quite often so it
23:39 - needs to be something that's repetitive
23:41 - and it needs to be consistent so that's
23:43 - where i became successful in the way
23:45 - that i do my outreach with young people
23:47 - so i'm always trying to present them new
23:48 - information and i keep trying to bring
23:51 - people in and let them see people that
23:53 - look like them who are in these fields
23:55 - so it's important that we just expand
23:57 - the way that we already are connected
23:58 - with our young people through all the
24:00 - other social social services that we
24:02 - have created or we are part of and start
24:05 - to infiltrate it by saying you know what
24:07 - let's bring in some other people from
24:08 - the community that are in these other
24:10 - programs and show these babies that this
24:12 - is something else that you can do
24:13 - besides this right here
24:16 - and i think you do that at school
24:18 - early right i mean i'm gonna go back to
24:22 - our kids spend six and a half hours a
24:24 - day in school
24:25 - and all these other this is the reason
24:27 - why taft moved from the out-of-school
24:29 - space to being a school because in the
24:32 - out of school space you can only help
24:34 - the kids that can get there and that's
24:36 - great but you get to all the kids if you
24:40 - change their school environment
24:42 - and that's our whole focus is getting
24:44 - kids hands on early building up their
24:47 - confidence early bringing in
24:50 - people who look like them to work with
24:53 - them get them used to working with
24:55 - adults it starts in kindergarten
24:57 - and then as you work up and you get
24:59 - older and you have opportunity to do job
25:02 - shadows and internships it just becomes
25:05 - a part of what you do what we're talking
25:08 - about right now is something completely
25:10 - separate we're talking about computer
25:12 - science as if it's its own entity
25:14 - but you've got if you're going to make
25:15 - change in the school environment you
25:18 - actually have to change the environment
25:20 - so you know what we do because we don't
25:22 - have teachers who can teach computer
25:24 - science at the high school level we
25:27 - merge it in with math and we have a
25:29 - partnership we used to be with microsoft
25:31 - nails with amazon in our teacher
25:33 - scientist partnership program and they
25:36 - come in and they teach and they show the
25:38 - teacher what needs to happen when
25:40 - they're not there so the kids can
25:42 - continue moving on and it's in context
25:45 - of a project so now i'm interested in
25:47 - coding because i have an end goal that's
25:50 - tied to my grade right but i also have a
25:53 - project that i helped define and i'm
25:55 - interested in
25:57 - yeah you take that and then um for our
26:00 - younger kids it's more of a
26:02 - an elective or um just experiential
26:05 - learning and it's a little smaller scale
26:08 - but they're still working with external
26:10 - people that way we're not having the
26:12 - number one add a whole nother class that
26:15 - not everybody can go to
26:17 - right and and we we don't segregate kids
26:20 - so
26:21 - we're not adding another class we're not
26:23 - trying to um
26:24 - retrain teachers or anything like that
26:27 - we're bringing the experts in who know
26:29 - how to do this and who also want to
26:32 - teach so they get paid their big old
26:34 - salary from their company and then they
26:36 - volunteer their time with us and you
26:39 - know that's something that could be
26:40 - scalable
26:42 - um is scalable because we do it in seven
26:44 - schools right now um
26:47 - but we all i don't want us to lose the
26:50 - fact that the school structure is what's
26:53 - killing us here and then the other side
26:55 - is the corporate structure because
26:57 - nobody ever really talks to them about
26:59 - creating an environment where i feel
27:02 - welcome as a black woman
27:05 - programmer right it's always about
27:07 - pipeline pipeline pipeline well i can
27:10 - get to your company and if i feel like
27:12 - the environment
27:14 - is not welcoming to me i'm going to
27:15 - leave come on i have personally
27:18 - counseled a number of
27:20 - mostly black men
27:22 - who were trying to leave industry and
27:24 - i'm trying to get them they're young
27:26 - trying to get them to stay to make
27:27 - enough money so that
27:30 - they can come out and volunteer or maybe
27:32 - work in a non-profit or something
27:35 - but they can at least have that
27:36 - experience but look
27:38 - i don't care how many people
27:40 - of color you get i don't care how many
27:42 - black computer scientists you get it's
27:45 - never going to be a critical mass enough
27:48 - for them to feel like they are welcome
27:50 - in whatever company they work for so i
27:52 - think the onus needs to be put on these
27:55 - companies and you know maybe the big
27:58 - companies like microsoft amazon facebook
28:00 - they may be too big to change but all of
28:03 - those companies have people who have
28:05 - startups
28:06 - and what do they do they hire the same
28:08 - people who look like them who they're
28:10 - comfortable with and then all of a
28:12 - sudden somebody calls them on diversity
28:14 - it's like oh we never thought i needed
28:15 - to hire somebody right now that's always
28:18 - the excuse i needed to hire somebody
28:20 - right yeah so i went with you
28:22 - i'm gonna fall for that crap otherwise
28:24 - don't even say you care about that
28:27 - for real you're about people look all
28:29 - stop lying yes right
28:32 - i'm gonna jump
28:33 - trish i'm gonna jump in and i can't
28:36 - thank you enough because i'm just like
28:39 - leolan
28:40 - way back when
28:41 - my first computer science class at mount
28:43 - holyoke
28:44 - college way back when when we still had
28:47 - those the max that new holland described
28:50 - yes
28:51 - yes it is a women's college therefore
28:53 - there was immense representation around
28:55 - the presence of women in that computer
28:57 - science class but as i look to the right
28:59 - and to the left
29:00 - vivid i was the only one that looked
29:03 - like me certainly the only one that also
29:05 - sounded like me and so representation is
29:08 - is incredibly important and so
29:12 - until we are able to um replicate and i
29:15 - hope this happens very soon an
29:18 - opportunity to replicate institution
29:20 - lacked half
29:21 - um
29:22 - what what arguments can continue to be
29:25 - made and you've made several and i'm
29:26 - curious if we can expand on those
29:28 - um until we are able to get to this
29:31 - incredible representation where
29:33 - arguments can be made
29:34 - in favor of focus recruitment
29:38 - for black teachers in cs education this
29:40 - is the first part of my question
29:42 - what focused arguments can be made
29:44 - around recruiting black students in cs
29:47 - and also for the purpose of
29:50 - leoland and i including our team here at
29:53 - code.org
29:54 - which one should we focus on first
29:57 - recruitment focused recruitment of black
29:58 - teachers focus recruitment of black
30:01 - students in computer science education
30:11 - yeah i really am that those are
30:13 - band-aids right now
30:16 - so um
30:18 - when i think about washington state we
30:21 - don't even have enough money you're
30:22 - talking about bringing in computer
30:24 - science teachers
30:26 - um we don't even have enough money to do
30:29 - a portion of the things that we should
30:31 - be doing as a state
30:33 - there are a lot of mandates with no
30:35 - funding right we got mandates on class
30:38 - size we got mandates on
30:40 - you know where there isn't one on
30:42 - bringing in teachers of color there
30:44 - needs to be one
30:45 - right so the teaching industry is just
30:47 - as bad or the education industry is just
30:50 - as bad in terms of recruitment um taff
30:53 - runs the martinez fellowship program
30:55 - where we bring bring teachers of color
30:57 - into washington state we don't really is
31:00 - we're not we're pretty agnostic in terms
31:02 - of what they teach we want them in our
31:04 - classrooms but it's really difficult
31:07 - because now you have the issue of
31:10 - teachers of color not feeling welcome in
31:12 - their own day up on school because
31:14 - they're one of one two or three and now
31:16 - they're new teachers right coming into
31:19 - the space
31:20 - and um of course new teacher regardless
31:22 - of your race the the experienced
31:24 - teachers are going to pooh-pooh any idea
31:26 - you have because they got a kind of
31:28 - comfy and cushy there and they don't
31:29 - want you rocking the boat they certainly
31:31 - don't want you rocking the boat if
31:33 - you're black
31:34 - right and then what they're going to do
31:36 - is send you all the black kids that they
31:38 - don't want to deal with because under
31:40 - the guise that you can relate to them
31:42 - right they never cared about that before
31:44 - but now that you're there you can relay
31:46 - to them and so now you're a new teacher
31:49 - you got your own responsibilities you
31:52 - got all these kids that you know you're
31:53 - not going to abandon because you're
31:54 - going to love them right and now you're
31:57 - you're saddled with a black tax you can
31:59 - no longer just be a teacher you got to
32:02 - be all things to black kids
32:05 - right you got to be all things sometimes
32:07 - to all the kids of color and you got to
32:09 - do your job so
32:11 - bringing in teachers is not enough again
32:14 - the environment you got to change the
32:16 - environment that they're coming into
32:19 - regardless of whether you're talking
32:20 - about teachers of computer science or or
32:23 - engineers and computer scientists in
32:25 - their field the environments are not
32:28 - made for us
32:30 - and it's very discouraging they're
32:31 - they're very discouraging too um um
32:33 - sister tradition
32:35 - you look at how they do our babies they
32:37 - they either put them in iss
32:39 - they label them with some type of um
32:41 - behavior disruptive um issue a problem
32:44 - and so they don't even like the school
32:47 - setting and let me just tell you a story
32:48 - about my own son you know my son was
32:51 - almost diagnosed with some adhd where
32:53 - the teacher is not even a clinician to
32:55 - even do something like that but wanted
32:57 - to tell me and my wife that my son had
32:59 - an issue because he wanted to stand up
33:01 - at his desk to do his work so i tell her
33:04 - move the desk of the corner so then if
33:06 - he stands up he ain't bumping nobody
33:08 - he's doing his work still just adjust
33:10 - yourself a little bit so did i ask her
33:13 - again i said and give me your one reason
33:15 - give me your biggest
33:17 - issue that you have in my son that you
33:19 - showing me that he has some type of adhd
33:23 - behavior problem and she tells me that
33:25 - one day she asked him to go to recess
33:27 - and he gets up very quickly without
33:29 - grabbing his coat and just runs to the
33:30 - front of the line i said you better not
33:32 - put down in your notes you better not
33:35 - that is that's that is crazy that you
33:37 - have the opportunity to do that so why
33:39 - do i say all that and i had to also
33:42 - advocate for my son let me just tell you
33:44 - this how to advocate for my son and i
33:47 - had to hold him back a year get him back
33:50 - into an environment where he was getting
33:52 - encouraged to go to school and then put
33:55 - him back into the school system where
33:57 - now he's thriving because he's now
33:59 - encouraged to stay in school and want to
34:01 - be in school so you are so right sister
34:04 - trish around what these schools are
34:05 - doing to our kids mentally it is
34:07 - discouraging for them to even want to be
34:09 - in that building so when you talk about
34:11 - recruiting our black
34:13 - teachers and getting our black students
34:16 - dire my environment is so toxic that you
34:19 - first had to adjust whatever places
34:21 - these babies are learning from that has
34:24 - to be straightened up that has to be
34:26 - fixed there's no way that you're going
34:28 - to put the our black and brown babies in
34:30 - this environment and think that just
34:31 - because you put a black teacher in there
34:33 - that's gonna be all good and you're
34:35 - right such a trish i go into these
34:36 - schools they send me right to the iss
34:39 - right to the iss for shot go talk to
34:41 - these babies or rashad we got men do you
34:42 - want a mentor or should i go talk to
34:44 - these babies and they're all in iss
34:47 - they're just sitting there and those
34:48 - teachers who are those individuals who
34:50 - are sitting at iss they're not even
34:52 - teachers or para educators there are
34:54 - people who are just coming in saying
34:55 - that i need a job so let me just make
34:58 - sure that i can sit here watch over our
35:00 - babies and at the same time they could
35:02 - be finished share their credentials to
35:03 - be a teacher yeah and so can you expand
35:06 - on iss just for the audience that's the
35:08 - end school suspension that's a black
35:10 - room it's it's just it's the prison it's
35:13 - a school-to-prison complex that's the
35:16 - that is the gate keeper of putting our
35:19 - babies inside that prison to school um
35:22 - um complex because those rooms i'm gonna
35:25 - tell you right now
35:26 - most of them don't have no windows
35:29 - the the curtains usually are closed it's
35:31 - very dark it's not it's it's it's not
35:34 - even a classroom setup it's it's very
35:37 - it's it's very discouraging for a
35:40 - student to know that they're in a room
35:42 - where they're not even learning any
35:43 - content to get themselves ahead but
35:45 - they're sitting there because their
35:47 - behavior
35:48 - that's what that is so it's very
35:50 - discouraging for us to think that our
35:52 - babies are in environments where they
35:54 - want to learn that there's some type of
35:56 - programming and they could get into and
35:58 - not even be in a proper classes
36:01 - to even get themselves to be in such a
36:03 - program like we're talking about right
36:04 - now
36:05 - and behavioral
36:06 - classrooms are pretty much the same
36:09 - as well
36:10 - that's under the guise of special ed yep
36:13 - that's exactly what it is
36:15 - yeah so i know we sound discouraging i'm
36:18 - sorry
36:19 - but you know we don't sound truthful we
36:21 - just disagree we sound truthful but i
36:23 - know they want to come out with
36:24 - something but here's the thing
36:26 - 90 of teachers in our public schools are
36:30 - white
36:32 - i don't know how many people know that
36:34 - and out of that 90
36:37 - i would say probably 85 percent of them
36:39 - are women
36:42 - right we lost all our black teachers and
36:44 - yeah because they were not allowed to
36:46 - have jobs
36:48 - in the integrated schools
36:50 - and so we've been working hard as a
36:52 - society to get it back and then you got
36:54 - the other side that says and this was a
36:57 - personal challenge for me when we
36:59 - started tap is you know i know we need
37:01 - black teachers but i'm trying to get you
37:03 - ready for a tech job right and how can i
37:07 - tell you to go be a teacher when i know
37:10 - you can make generational changes
37:12 - within your family and your community by
37:15 - getting a job in computer science and
37:18 - then i'm also sending you to the wolves
37:20 - because i know they don't want you right
37:22 - so it's like god you know but but you
37:25 - keep doing it and i don't know what the
37:27 - role is for code.org in terms of
37:30 - changing
37:31 - um
37:32 - you know changing what you want you want
37:34 - to get more black teachers you want to
37:36 - get more black students um into computer
37:39 - science but it's
37:41 - the infrastructure has got to change it
37:44 - really does and until that changes
37:47 - you're going to be you'll have success
37:49 - here success there you know maybe find a
37:51 - school
37:52 - that has um already has a high
37:56 - percentage of black teachers and see if
37:58 - you can wrap code.org stuff around that
38:01 - school
38:02 - and what the possibilities are but but
38:05 - um
38:06 - there is no
38:07 - no nationwide strategy to do that kind
38:11 - of thing and honestly i don't know if we
38:14 - need to be scaling like that
38:16 - right it's like we need more depth than
38:18 - breath
38:20 - and so this is going to go slower and i
38:22 - know you young people want to go fast
38:24 - but you know it it has to you've got to
38:28 - get depth and build relationships
38:31 - right now what's happening is very
38:32 - transactional and it doesn't last
38:36 - right and so you need to have those
38:37 - relationships that are deep with with
38:40 - teachers with students with families
38:43 - with community for change and people are
38:46 - finally starting to come around with
38:48 - that we used to get pooh-poohed for that
38:50 - all the time
38:51 - right why don't you scale why don't you
38:52 - scale you can't cause learning
38:55 - you just can't
38:57 - so what we can do though is to really
39:00 - build a systemic structure so that
39:02 - people can maintain it without having to
39:05 - have tap there all the time right let's
39:08 - get people started let's build community
39:10 - together and that's what how we're going
39:13 - to win so we need to get away from those
39:16 - majority population
39:18 - methods
39:20 - and move more to what we're used to as a
39:22 - community
39:23 - can you expand a little bit on and i
39:25 - couldn't agree more with you and i will
39:27 - take and accept my my designation as a
39:29 - youth
39:31 - that's good
39:32 - all y'all i'm 63 years old all you all
39:34 - are babies come on now
39:36 - we'll take it okay thank you
39:39 - all right
39:41 - i'm i'm curious if you can um expand on
39:44 - the the importance of of steady desert
39:47 - right really the importance of being
39:49 - able to to create this this relationship
39:52 - locally originally and dr brown uh once
39:55 - trish is able to take it there i'd love
39:57 - for you to touch a little bit on what
39:59 - does this look like as you are yourself
40:02 - working and and and and essentially
40:04 - growing growing teachers how are you
40:07 - instilling quite a bit of what we're
40:08 - talking about here through your lenses
40:10 - as we're working with with teachers so
40:11 - trish take us to i'll just quickly
40:13 - summarize it's about building trust
40:16 - it really is you know one of the things
40:18 - i talk to people about particularly um
40:21 - uh young folks getting into leadership
40:24 - and all that is that you need to show up
40:26 - as yourself every time so that people
40:29 - know what to expect and it's the same
40:31 - thing when when you're partnering
40:34 - with schools and students and families
40:36 - they need to know what to expect they
40:38 - need to be able to trust
40:40 - right they already have been um
40:43 - marginalized so much and told so many
40:45 - lies and and so for us it's really
40:49 - important that
40:50 - um they know that their kids are our
40:53 - kids that they understand exactly what
40:55 - we're doing we're not hiding anything
40:57 - we're actually sharing with families
40:59 - what their kids are doing
41:01 - right that we we as an organization are
41:04 - majority people of color so that helps a
41:06 - lot right and so they know and most of
41:09 - us well it used to be not anymore but
41:11 - most of us came from washington state
41:14 - and from this area in particular right
41:16 - and so all those things together
41:19 - really build that trust and we stay with
41:22 - the kids until they understand it right
41:25 - it's not like for two weeks we're
41:27 - learning this if you don't know it we're
41:28 - sending you over here to the kids you
41:31 - know to remedial learning it's like
41:33 - however long it takes you
41:35 - yeah we're going to stay with you
41:37 - because you got to learn this standard
41:39 - and and your teammates will help you and
41:41 - every right so it's that whole community
41:44 - um so we shy away from that timeline of
41:47 - by the end of this school year you need
41:49 - to know these 20 things
41:51 - you know you might know 10 of them and i
41:52 - can see you're emerging on another 10.
41:54 - i'm not going to fail you
41:56 - right we we see you're growing
41:59 - right that's the kind of stuff i'm
42:00 - talking about all right it's not that
42:03 - quick
42:03 - um oh you failed your state test in
42:06 - third grade we're gonna change your
42:08 - entire life because of that one data
42:11 - point
42:12 - all right and we're not changing it for
42:14 - good
42:15 - yeah thank you
42:17 - thank you
42:18 - dr brown
42:20 - well you know along those same lines i
42:22 - think teaching is always about culture
42:24 - uh and and this actually addresses the
42:26 - the
42:27 - not the computer science world as well
42:29 - uh culture is not your idea of what
42:32 - people are but it's your decisions about
42:34 - people so dealing with the institutions
42:36 - the the businesses uh if you look at
42:38 - your leadership team uh you've made a
42:41 - decision just look at the pictures who
42:42 - is your senior leadership who's your hr
42:44 - department uh who's your recruitment
42:46 - team uh who are your middle managers
42:49 - just look at the pictures and that will
42:51 - tell you about the decisions you've made
42:53 - about culture and that speaks volumes
42:55 - far far louder than any diversity
42:57 - statement the hiring of a diversity
42:59 - inclusion officer your decisions are
43:01 - reflected
43:03 - the culture is reflected in your
43:04 - decisions so as a teacher
43:06 - right the decisions i'm making is what
43:08 - am i teaching
43:09 - and where does it live so for example
43:11 - we've tried to build out a culturally
43:13 - relevant curriculum uh in computer
43:15 - science and engineering so the question
43:17 - was what do i teach that the kids will
43:19 - take great pride in and it's not
43:21 - complicated we go ask the kids what are
43:23 - you interested in right what is the
43:24 - thing that you're you're most curious
43:26 - about and that's what we teach them the
43:28 - code yeah so quick examples and i'll
43:30 - move on is we had a group of elementary
43:33 - school kids who wanted to build a robot
43:34 - but here's what was interesting they
43:36 - wanted to build and program robots to
43:38 - carry groceries for the grandparents
43:39 - right so it was about the abuela the
43:42 - older kids were interested in
43:43 - gentrification so we were we were
43:46 - helping them build websites to tell the
43:47 - story of the city of oakland so
43:49 - tell me the the pride of your community
43:52 - so the thought is that the actual
43:54 - instruction sends a message it's a
43:56 - decision what do i value and so again
43:59 - i'll go back to the same point we don't
44:00 - teach anything you don't teach computer
44:02 - science you teach people you have to
44:04 - start understanding what they're
44:05 - interested in and that's where you're
44:07 - that's where the coding language should
44:08 - be taught and so that's the big thing is
44:10 - a real focus on culture
44:12 - students yeah
44:14 - yeah culture is big i i teach that
44:16 - you're you are totally correct um dr
44:18 - brown and and you know
44:21 - when i when i connect with my young my
44:23 - young people i'm always trying to
44:25 - bring in
44:26 - the history you know james baldwin you
44:29 - know someone that i look up to he said
44:31 - if you don't know what happened behind
44:32 - you you never understand what's
44:33 - happening around you so you have to
44:35 - bring in you know this this structural
44:38 - context to these babies so they can see
44:40 - it and they reach and they they receive
44:43 - it i i'm so amazed that when people
44:45 - think that oh some of this stuff can be
44:47 - boring no it's your delivery it's how
44:49 - you deliver the message uh how are you
44:52 - and how consistent are you with the
44:54 - message you know it's just not no black
44:56 - history i don't call black this is black
44:58 - excellence this is not history this is
45:00 - excellence all around you that you need
45:02 - to see on a daily basis so when you do
45:05 - when i do my outreach and engagement i'm
45:07 - always trying to bring the excellence
45:09 - regardless of what month it is so they
45:11 - can see that this is something that's
45:13 - year-round this is your history this is
45:15 - not this i mean this is your excellence
45:17 - beyond just your history this is you
45:20 - look what's around you that is part of
45:22 - you that you had no idea that you had no
45:25 - idea so it is it's been bringing me joy
45:29 - to be able to bring individuals such as
45:30 - yourself i've been working with sister
45:32 - tris she opened up path i was probably
45:35 - one of the first mentors that came into
45:37 - that school to meet with some of those
45:38 - students and really talk to them so and
45:41 - i i have nothing but the utmost respect
45:42 - for what she did and i still love that
45:44 - school what she's doing
45:46 - and so um you know the the outreach and
45:49 - engagement piece is very important we
45:51 - cannot go and recruit our babies we have
45:53 - to do engagement and outreach with them
45:55 - it's a big difference when you recruit
45:58 - you're going for numbers and then your
46:00 - your your mindset is set with that
46:03 - western civilization mindset where we're
46:06 - looking for numbers and measurements
46:07 - where you need to get to
46:09 - our way of interacting and engaging
46:12 - which is more relational so you have to
46:14 - go in wanting to engage you wanted to do
46:17 - our outreach true outreach i'm not
46:20 - trying to recruit you i'm trying to
46:22 - engage with you so that means that you
46:23 - have to bring in all types of different
46:26 - information that represents who they are
46:28 - so they can see it
46:30 - yes
46:31 - yes
46:32 - these are no i don't know
46:37 - well listen i
46:39 - and i we knew this would happen one hour
46:42 - is not enough it's not nearly enough
46:45 - um i will say this these these are
46:48 - we we are consistently re-rethinking our
46:52 - outreach um not just leona not just
46:54 - myself but the entire outreach team
46:56 - rethinking
46:58 - outreach rethinking outreach with being
47:00 - with having incredible level of
47:02 - mindfulness
47:03 - um what i have gathered what recently
47:06 - have gathered collectively is dr brown
47:08 - talked to us really thinking about
47:10 - student empowerment
47:11 - psychology of performance trish you
47:14 - highlighted the importance of creating a
47:16 - structure that is welcoming that is
47:18 - grooming that is creating that
47:21 - foundations for students to see
47:22 - themselves in this curriculum and also
47:24 - specific around community engagement
47:27 - right
47:28 - growth steady slow
47:31 - um
47:32 - dr brown you also highlighted the
47:33 - importance of co-designing as we are
47:36 - bringing not only teachers but students
47:39 - engaging them into the process of what
47:42 - it means to be able to be part of this
47:43 - curriculum um brother rashad you
47:46 - definitely talk to us about thinking a
47:47 - little outside of the box so certainly
47:49 - we go into these um
47:51 - into computer science into tech what
47:52 - does it look like to bring it back to
47:54 - the community what does it look like to
47:56 - be able to think about access to those
47:58 - advanced classes how do we normalize and
48:00 - to certainly demystify what it looks
48:02 - like
48:03 - um
48:04 - and and culture you took us home
48:07 - dr brown
48:09 - in terms of rethinking what what culture
48:12 - looks like so i
48:14 - i certainly these are a few of many gems
48:17 - that you shared with us trish you are
48:19 - very right this is just the beginning
48:23 - we are appreciative of of your time
48:25 - being here with us and um
48:28 - aqua moderator leolain it's gone
48:31 - actually before we wrapped up i just
48:32 - wanted to give you all just um do have a
48:35 - couple more minutes if you if there's
48:36 - anything that you feel like you wanted
48:38 - the audience to hear that you haven't
48:40 - got a chance to say or we haven't asked
48:42 - um here's the perfect time we would love
48:44 - to hear anything else you all would like
48:45 - to close us out with um i would like to
48:48 - see everybody that
48:52 - says
48:54 - they care about black students
48:56 - and all students of color
48:59 - to actually go on a personal anti-racism
49:03 - journey
49:05 - we don't need allies we need
49:06 - co-conspirators
49:08 - and in order to be a co-conspirator you
49:11 - need to also be anti-racist
49:13 - so
49:14 - it's not enough to say i don't condone
49:16 - racism
49:19 - uh you got to take that next step
49:20 - further and it's going to be painful as
49:23 - hell
49:24 - and they're going to be some roadblocks
49:25 - but it will say a lot about whether
49:27 - you're true to it or not if you push
49:29 - through it
49:30 - [Music]
49:32 - and i always like i i like to end just
49:34 - saying that you know um
49:36 - we we come through this month of
49:38 - february we say black history but like
49:40 - again i like to say black excellence and
49:42 - a lot of dei work wouldn't even have
49:45 - started if it wasn't for our black
49:47 - plight or black injustices that happened
49:50 - then are in and continue to happen to
49:52 - our babies our black and brown babies in
49:54 - these schools so um just like such a
49:57 - trish you know she i like her as
49:59 - co-conspirator i say accomplice you know
50:01 - i just say you know what help me build
50:02 - the whole plan and help me tear it down
50:04 - too so if i get caught you right behind
50:06 - me saying i helped them and so you know
50:08 - i don't want you to talk about some oh i
50:10 - knew i heard about the plan but no no no
50:12 - i don't want you hearing about i want
50:13 - you to say my hands was on it too and so
50:16 - i love it um but i'll just say that you
50:19 - know there's so many babies out here
50:20 - that we we cannot forget i work with
50:22 - incarcerated youth and this is the shirt
50:24 - that i represent today with them and i
50:26 - told them that i'm gonna give them a
50:27 - shout out and it stands for um
50:30 - making a difference every day made men
50:32 - and these young
50:34 - young fellows who are getting out of the
50:35 - prison incarcerated system and they're
50:37 - becoming part of our community again so
50:40 - even implement even introducing to this
50:42 - type of field is something that i'm i've
50:44 - i've been doing so this is good so i
50:47 - just want to give a shout out and then
50:48 - also say thank you to you for inviting

51:15 - i'm relevant engagement on my um on my
51:18 - instagram and linkedin and then facebook
51:21 - shot perfect thank you so on behalf of
51:24 - code.org we'd like to thank all the
51:26 - panelists for their time today um i was
51:28 - taking notes and i had to remind myself
51:30 - that i'm moderating this i can't just

51:34 - really appreciate you all time um like
51:36 - sabine said an hour definitely isn't
51:38 - enough time to discuss this topic but
51:40 - hopefully the audience you were able to
51:42 - gain some knowledge and action steps
51:44 - that you can take back to your school
51:45 - districts and classrooms
51:47 - when we close the survey will pop up
51:49 - please take a couple of minutes to
51:50 - complete it as will provide us valuable
51:52 - feedback on this panel as well as help
51:54 - us to ensure that the next series of
51:56 - panels will be as valuable to you as
51:58 - this one is
51:59 - if you're a school or a teacher or
52:01 - school administrator and are interested
52:03 - in code.org computer science
52:04 - professional development applications
52:06 - are now open across the u.s and yes
52:08 - scholarships are available for teachers
52:10 - who meet the requirements please visit
52:12 - code.org apply for more information
52:15 - so this panel is a part of a series of
52:17 - panels on recruiting black students and
52:19 - teachers to computer science that we
52:21 - will be hosting throughout the next few
52:23 - months please follow us on twitter at
52:25 - code.org to stay up to date as these are
52:28 - scheduled thank you all so much again
52:30 - for watching and we'll see you soon
52:32 - bye-bye thank you take care everybody
52:36 - y'all be good be safe stay healthy thank
