00:01 - Data and Medicine
00:09 - This is really a magic era for 
software.
00:12 - We can use computers now to simulate so many different things.
00:16 - So every person has a DNA sequence that's 3 billion letters long.
00:20 - That's a really long sequence!
00:22 - And in order for me to study it, I can't do it by hand.
00:25 - I need to use computer programming in order to go through this code that's 3 billion letters long
00:30 - in order to figure out how your DNA code is associated with disease.
00:34 - My interests are actually right at the interface between biology and computer science.
00:38 - There is a huge database that contains all known organisms...
00:43 - so humans, monkeys, mice, viruses, bacteria.
00:47 - Usually now if a doctor is worried about you having an infection,
00:52 - based on your age and where your symptoms are
00:56 - if it's in your ear, your heart, or your brain,
01:00 - they try to make a best guess as to what type of infection you have.
01:05 - Then they'll send off tests specifically for those bugs.
01:10 - So if they think you have strep throat, they send off the strep test.
01:14 - But the type of testing that we do, since we can essentially test for any type of infection
01:19 - with a single test so we don't have to have a bias going into the testing
01:24 - saying we think it's X, Y, or Z.
01:26 - We just say "let's see what's in there".
01:30 - A Cottage Grove teenager now says he's taking one life one day at a time
01:34 - after being critically ill from a mysterious illness.
01:37 - Mary Jolla has his story and details into new DNA sequencing that helped solve a medical mystery.
01:45 - It's spring and like any other teenager, Joshua Osborn can't be stuck indoors.
01:51 - Josh: "I feel wonderful today. It's 80 degrees."
01:54 - It's a welcome change from last summer, here in the hospital and in a coma.
02:01 - His symptoms began last April with fevers and headaches and he only got worse.
02:06 - Clark: "And he needed to be hospitalized."
02:09 - Josh may not remember the hospital stay but his dad, Clark does.
02:13 - They tested for everything that they knew.
02:16 - They tested for viruses and bacteria and ultimately he had a brain scan
02:21 - and two or three spinal taps.
02:25 - He had all these crazy tubes.
02:28 - I remember that weekend when they were doing it,
02:30 - it was so intense. It was like he was going to die that week.
02:34 - We got Josh's samples from his doctor, because his doctor was giving up.
02:39 - They had no idea.
02:40 - They sunk millions of dollars into this kid and they have used hundreds of test. Hundreds--
02:46 - sent to the CDC, sent to multiple labs, and
they couldn't get an answer back.
02:51 - And they... I mean so much money right?And they turned to us and they were like,
02:55 - "We need to know what it is."
03:04 - So this is where we have the gene sequencers.
03:08 - We got a small amount of Josh's cerebral spinal fluid which is the fluid that bathes the brain,
03:15 - with very powerful computer algorithms we took out all the human sequences that were present in the data.
03:24 - And then searched all the non-human sequences that we got against a giant database that
03:31 - contains gene sequences of all known organisms.
03:36 - And very quickly we saw that the sequences were all for a particular organism
03:42 - that Josh likely contracted when he visited Puerto Rico about nine months before.
03:49 - And fortunately, that organism, it's a bacterium.
03:53 - And there is a very straightforward treatment for it: penicillin.
03:57 - The doctor gave him the drugs that same day and he was fine 24 hours later.
04:03 - All I can tell you is that, I'm happy to be alive and I have dreams and
04:11 - I'm looking forward to accomplishing them.
04:17 - Data analysis is changing all medicine.
04:20 - It's not just changing how diseases are diagnosed.
04:23 - Data is changing how we discover cures to diseases.
04:26 - And even after a cure is known, data is used for delivering medicine to patients,
04:31 - for example, to fight polio in Africa by distributing vaccines to everybody who needs it.
04:37 - The magic of polio is finding all the kids and getting them to have the vaccine three times.
04:46 - And so we're taking satellite photographs
04:48 - and using visual analysis to figure out what the population is.
04:54 - And so we can look and see if we're giving out a certain amount of vaccine
04:58 - are we really reaching all the kids?
05:01 - And amazingly what we found, on the boundaries between political areas
05:06 - there are various settlements that one group thought that the other group was taking care of.
05:11 - We also can take the phone that has the GPS tracking
05:16 - and when they come back at the end of the day, plug it in,
05:20 - and see where they've been every minute.
05:23 - And that's making all the difference because just getting coverage up from 80% of kids to 90% of kids
05:30 - that's the difference between success and failure.
05:33 - And literally the software that lets us look at the movements of the teams,
05:38 - looks at the satellite maps, gathers all the statistics together and tracks this thing,
05:44 - that's what's going to make this the second disease we finally get rid of.
05:49 - So it's systems thinking, and the magic of software are really at the center.
