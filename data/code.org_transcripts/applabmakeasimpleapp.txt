00:09 - metamorphos and we take your old rip
00:11 - clothes and turn them into new
00:14 - accessories in addition to the website
00:17 - we wanted to make an app using app lab
00:19 - and i'm going to show you how i made
00:20 - that
00:21 - so now i'm already in the code mode so
00:24 - i'm going to go up here and switch to
00:25 - design
00:27 - so now it shows me all of these buttons
00:31 - that i can choose to put pull in pull
00:34 - and drag
00:35 - and i can change the background color
00:38 - so i'm gonna click on this and choose a
00:41 - color that i
00:43 - like for the background
00:45 - so how about this color
00:49 - right here
00:52 - and now i'm going to name the screen so
00:54 - that i know what it's going to be called
00:57 - so i'm going to call this the home
00:59 - it's in catalog the home screen
01:03 - so now i'm going to
01:05 - drag this text box on and i can change
01:08 - the text over here
01:09 - to say the title of
01:12 - what i want this to be called
01:19 - so now
01:20 - and i can also
01:22 - over here
01:23 - scroll down and change the font size
01:30 - okay and
01:32 - i can also
01:34 - change
01:35 - where the text is by dragging it
01:40 - so
01:41 - now
01:42 - i'm also going to add an image
01:46 - so i'm going to just pull this image on
01:49 - and then i can here and go to picture
01:52 - and hit choose so now i can upload a
01:55 - file
02:02 - so now i can hit choose and there's my
02:04 - image
02:06 - so i'm going to center it
02:09 - and
02:11 - there
02:12 - so now i'm going to add some more text
02:13 - so i'm just going to pull this
02:15 - text box over and
02:18 - say
02:29 - not going to finish because that was too
02:31 - long to type
02:32 - so
02:33 - so now that i have this screen i'm going
02:36 - to add a new screen
02:38 - so
02:40 - it's going to be my donate screen so i'm
02:42 - going to drag this text on and
02:44 - call it donate
02:48 - and i'm also going to make the font size
02:50 - bigger
02:53 - and drag it a little bit so now i'm
02:55 - going to also change the background
02:56 - color to
02:59 - a different color
03:01 - and this page is going to be different
03:03 - because
03:04 - it's going to have a quick
03:06 - survey like thing
03:08 - so i'm going to actually use these radio
03:10 - buttons
03:11 - because that allows you that makes sure
03:13 - that the user only checks one instead of
03:16 - both at the same time unlike a checks
03:18 - box check check box
03:21 - and
03:21 - so i'm gonna
03:23 - you have to create a group id so that
03:25 - they only check one so i'm gonna call
03:26 - this survey
03:29 - and same on the other one and i'm also
03:31 - gonna
03:32 - rename this to just be radio
03:36 - button
03:37 - one
03:39 - and do the same the other
03:45 - okay
03:48 - radio
03:52 - button
03:53 - 2
03:55 - and
03:58 - survey so i'm also going to make a
04:02 - question
04:04 - so
04:06 - would you
04:09 - donate
04:10 - your
04:12 - clothes
04:13 - to us
04:17 - so
04:18 - now i'm gonna also put the answers so
04:21 - they could either say
04:23 - yes
04:25 - or no
04:27 - so this will be yes
04:32 - yes
04:34 - and this one will say no
04:41 - no
04:45 - so
04:46 - so now
04:47 - you're going to add a button that says
04:50 - submit
04:51 - or whatever you want so that when they
04:55 - choose
04:56 - either yes or no they have a they can
04:59 - submit it and then it will take them to
05:01 - a new page so
05:03 - if you hit
05:04 - so
05:05 - for right now i'm gonna do two pages so
05:07 - if they say yes
05:09 - i'm going to add a new screen and it
05:11 - will be like a
05:13 - thank you screen
05:14 - so we'll say
05:16 - thanks for your
05:20 - input
05:24 - then i'm going to also do it
05:26 - first i have to name this so this is if
05:28 - they say yes
05:32 - yes
05:33 - and then i'm going to add another screen
05:35 - and if they say no
05:37 - so so i'm going to call this no
05:40 - then this screen
05:42 - is going to be
05:43 - like green
05:47 - and this will say
05:49 - maybe next time
05:58 - i'm also going to make this
06:00 - bigger
06:05 - now
06:06 - that i have this all set up i'm going to
06:08 - do the code
06:09 - so i'm going to drag this on event
06:12 - when
06:14 - button 4
06:16 - is clicked
06:19 - i'm going to go to control
06:20 - and say
06:22 - if
06:24 - and then
06:30 - uh
06:36 - can't find it
06:37 - oh here if
06:39 - get checked
06:42 - if radio
06:44 - radio button
06:48 - one
06:49 - gets checked
06:52 - then
06:55 - set the screen
06:58 - to screen yes because radio button one
07:00 - is the one if they said check yes
07:04 - then you're going to add a plus down
07:06 - here
07:08 - and then
07:11 - so then you're going to do the same
07:12 - thing so if
07:15 - get checked here it is
07:20 - but then this one is radio button two
07:24 - button
07:25 - two gets if so if radio button two gets
07:28 - checked i'm going to set the screen
07:32 - to the no screen
07:35 - so now this should work so next we're
07:38 - going to do the drop down so that you
07:39 - can change between
07:42 - the different pages so i'm gonna go to
07:44 - home first
07:46 - so you're gonna just drag this drop down
07:48 - on
07:50 - and option one
07:53 - okay so you can change the option so
07:54 - option one should be home
07:56 - then donate and you don't want to have
07:59 - the option to yes or no because that
08:02 - is
08:02 - based off of the survey
08:06 - so i'm going to call this
08:09 - drop
08:11 - down
08:14 - one
08:16 - so then
08:18 - you're gonna also add one on the donate
08:21 - page
08:22 - so that you can get back to home
08:26 - so option one and option two
08:32 - okay
08:36 - so home
08:39 - and donate
08:43 - and i'm gonna call this drop down too
08:46 - so
08:47 - now you're gonna go back into code
08:50 - so now that i've
08:52 - added the drop down we're going to make
08:55 - the codes so that it actually
08:57 - changes between the different pages so
09:00 - i'm going to drag this on event
09:02 - so if
09:04 - drop down 1
09:05 - is changed
09:08 - then you're going to go to control
09:12 - so if
09:15 - so basically
09:17 - if
09:19 - what
09:21 - so
09:22 - if
09:24 - what they
09:26 - if drop down 1
09:28 - equals donate for example
09:33 - then you want to set the screen to the
09:36 - donate screen
09:38 - so set screen and donate
09:42 - so
09:43 - then you're also going to want to do
09:45 - this on the other donate page but for
09:48 - the opposite
09:49 - for the home
09:50 - so an easy way to do this is if you go
09:53 - to
09:53 - the text
09:55 - you can
09:56 - just copy
09:59 - and then you're going to copy this down
10:01 - here
10:04 - and
10:06 - i'm just going to go to block mode and
10:08 - change
10:10 - these so instead of drop down 1 you want
10:13 - drop down 2
10:15 - and you want it to equal home
10:19 - and then set screen to home
10:21 - so now you're just going to run this to
10:23 - see if this works so i'm going to hit
10:25 - run
10:26 - oh look it's on the home page let's go
10:28 - to donate
10:30 - it worked
10:31 - now would you done it you're close to us
10:33 - i'm going to say yes
10:34 - and submit
10:36 - thanks for your input
10:38 - this is a simple two-page app
10:41 - in the future you could also use this
10:42 - data button up here which allows you to
10:45 - view the data so that you can actually
10:48 - store the data that the user inputs
10:51 - so if you actually want to share your
10:53 - app you can click the share button and
10:56 - type in a phone number and there it is
10:58 - on my phone
