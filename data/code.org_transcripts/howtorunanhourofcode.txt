00:09 - Hi, my name is Alice and I work at Code.org.
00:14 - Today, we're calling on students from all
over the world to learn one Hour of Code.
00:19 - We need your help to make it happen.
00:21 - Participating in the Hour of Code means doing
a one hour computer science activity.
00:25 - It's for all learners, all ages, and is available
in over 30 languages.
00:30 - No previous experience is required and activities
are self-guided, empowering students to learn
00:35 - at their own pace.
00:37 - Students have already done over 100 million
Hours of Code during Computer Science Education
00:43 - Week and you can join the movement this December.
00:47 - This matters because the number of open computing
jobs are growing a lot faster than students
00:52 - entering the field.
00:54 - And these are great jobs!
00:55 - Every young person should have the opportunity
to learn these foundational skills no matter
01:00 - what field they end up pursuing.
01:02 - Now, let's talk about how to host an Hour
of Code itself.
01:07 - Step 1: Plan where you will do your Hour of
Code.
01:10 - You can offer the Hour of Code on any device
including tablets, PCs, Macs, smartphones.
01:17 - Students can also take turns in your classroom
using a shared computer or try a tutorial
01:22 - together on the board.
01:24 - There are even unplugged tutorials that can
be completed without any computers at all.
01:28 - Unplugged options can be done anywhere!
01:30 - Even outdoors.
01:31 - These activities are especially fun for groups
and really illustrate the point that computational
01:36 - thinking isn't just about computers.
01:39 - Once you've planned where you'll be doing it,
it's time for Step 2: Picking a tutorial.
01:45 - We have over 20 different one hour tutorials
to choose from, each introducing computer
01:49 - science in its own way for all students from
K-12 and all learners of any age.
01:56 - For example, there's a tutorial that teaches
you how to create an interactive card using
02:01 - the programming environment Scratch.
02:03 - Another one from Khan Academy teaches the
basics of JavaScript, a popular programming
02:07 - language.
02:09 - Code.org offers tutorials that introduce computer
science principles through fun puzzles and
02:14 - art, featuring characters students love like
Angry Birds, Ice Age, Flappy Bird, Anna and
02:20 - Elsa from Frozen, and more!
02:22 - Check out the options and choose the best
fit for your students.
02:26 - We encourage you to try your selected tutorial
yourself, before your class does it, so you
02:30 - can answer questions that might come up.
02:33 - And now you're ready to go to Step 3: Coding.
02:35 - It's time for your students to do the Hour
of Code themselves.
02:39 - Have them visit code.org/learn and choose
the tutorial you picked out.
02:44 - Students who finish early can try a different,
perhaps more advanced tutorial, or help others.
02:50 - If you're doing an unplugged tutorial, pass
out the materials and explain the rules.
02:54 - That's it!
02:55 - As you can see, hosting an Hour of Code with
your students requires minimal prep and no
03:00 - prior experience.
