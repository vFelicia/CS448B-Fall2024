00:00 - on behalf of microsoft it's a real honor
00:02 - to be here and to celebrate the
00:03 - wonderful code.org community
00:06 - um co.org's mission is deeply personal
00:09 - to me i am an engineer
00:12 - at college i learned a code and my first
00:14 - job
00:15 - outside of college was coding and
00:17 - computer science has in many ways been
00:20 - the foundation of my career it's really
00:22 - changed my life
00:23 - but i have to say
00:25 - it almost was an accident it wasn't
00:27 - supposed to be that way and i'll give
00:29 - you a little bit of the back story on
00:30 - that
00:31 - i am one of 15 kids so i have 14
00:34 - brothers and sisters in my family
00:36 - there's a little bit irish catholic in
00:38 - there that's how that happened
00:39 - um
00:41 - but i had the the unenviable position i
00:43 - wasn't the oldest i wasn't the youngest
00:45 - i was one of the 13 in the middle so for
00:47 - those of you who remember the brady
00:48 - bunch i definitely had some jan brady
00:50 - syndrome but my parents had two rules um
00:54 - one you had to go to college and two you
00:57 - had to pay for it yourself
00:59 - so
00:59 - following my older brothers and sisters
01:01 - as younger siblings do they had already
01:04 - gone off to college and many of them had
01:05 - become business majors and so i just
01:07 - sort of followed in their footsteps went
01:09 - off to san diego state got a job on
01:12 - campus and started my what i thought was
01:14 - going to be my my business degree
01:17 - and one day i find myself delivering a
01:19 - package to the engineering department a
01:21 - place i have never been to before in my
01:24 - life i didn't even know where it was i'd
01:25 - ask people how to get there
01:27 - so i walk in and i struck up a
01:29 - conversation with the two executive
01:32 - assistants who were behind the desk
01:34 - and who were strangely so excited to see
01:37 - me and what i didn't realize is they'd
01:39 - just been having a conversation about
01:41 - how they could get
01:42 - more women into engineering
01:45 - and the sad fact was they just they they
01:48 - tried they just couldn't get more in and
01:50 - all of a sudden i showed up in front of
01:52 - them so these two ladies they went to
01:54 - work on me they sat me down
01:55 - on the clock by the way
01:57 - and they said so what are you studying
01:59 - you know what are you going to be
02:01 - do you like math and science have you
02:03 - ever considered
02:05 - seeking a degree in engineering and
02:08 - frankly to be brutally honest no i
02:10 - didn't even really know what engineers
02:12 - did to tell you the truth there was no
02:13 - engineers in my family
02:15 - going up there you know it was business
02:17 - majors
02:18 - and these two ladies just started
02:19 - working on me and working on me and i
02:21 - remember something that still resonates
02:23 - with me today they said the world will
02:25 - be your oyster if you pursue an
02:27 - engineering degree
02:28 - and the next morning i woke up changed
02:30 - my major to engineering and i tell you
02:32 - this story because it has a lot to do
02:34 - with luck
02:35 - when i looked around at my classes they
02:37 - were it was under 10 and the double e
02:40 - department were women i was i was just
02:42 - there by pure luck because of this
02:44 - package i had dropped off and frankly
02:48 - the the issue is that for too many of
02:51 - our young women today for too many of
02:53 - our young people of color for too many
02:54 - young people all together luck is still
02:57 - too much a part of the equation
02:59 - and as computer scientists
03:01 - luck is not a variable we like to deal
03:03 - with data okay probability odds things
03:06 - we can change but luck not so much
03:09 - and for me i wanted to be able to to
03:13 - change this number and
03:16 - for you the opportunity is there every
03:19 - day
03:19 - we are improving the odds with our kids
03:22 - when teachers introduce them to our of
03:25 - code when schools and districts scrape
03:27 - money together to get a computer
03:29 - scientist on their payroll and every day
03:32 - we can change a kid's life by saying to
03:35 - them hey have you ever thought about
03:38 - pursuing a degree
03:39 - and hey have you ever thought about
03:42 - going after coding and learning how to
03:44 - code
03:45 - so it's really incumbent upon all of us
03:47 - to to change that equation
03:52 - in computer science
03:53 - or sorry
03:55 - code.org is all about
03:58 - really it's all about changing that
04:00 - equation leveling the playing field for
04:02 - all of these young kids it's why
04:04 - microsoft is so deeply involved in the
04:07 - program we're a founding member of it
04:09 - and we're continuing to embrace that
04:11 - vision because every child should have
04:13 - the opportunity to be able to change the
04:16 - world and coding is one way that they
04:17 - can do that no matter where she was born
04:20 - no matter who her parents are no matter
04:22 - what hallway she walked down to get
04:23 - there so thanks very much i hope you
04:25 - enjoy the rest of the day
