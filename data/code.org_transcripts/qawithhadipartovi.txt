00:02 - welcome everyone this is our QA event
00:05 - with CEO and founder of code or kadhi
00:07 - part OV we're really excited to have
00:09 - hottie with us tonight and we're going
00:10 - to jump into his presentation in just
00:12 - one minute go to the next slide I just
00:16 - wanted to bring your attention to the
00:17 - fact that we're going to be having a
00:19 - series of these live on event live
00:20 - events online for CS educators over the
00:23 - next several months we're generally
00:25 - having them on on Wednesdays or
00:27 - Thursdays towards the middle of the
00:29 - month this first session is the QA with
00:31 - Hattie part OV next month we're going to
00:33 - be talking about how we increase access
00:34 - to CS education and looking at some of
00:37 - the results of code orbs recent
00:39 - evaluation work and then moving into
00:41 - november and december we'll be taking a
00:42 - look at hour of code and how you can
00:44 - read it in your classroom so we're super
00:46 - excited that you're joining us tonight
00:47 - for the first session and we'll dive
00:48 - right in if you go to the next slide bar
00:50 - i'm really excited to introduce hardy
00:53 - for Toby many of you know hottie is the
00:55 - CEO and founder of code org hottie is
00:58 - such an inspiration to all of us and has
01:00 - really been a driving force behind all
01:02 - the great work that we're doing here as
01:04 - an organization and tonight we've got a
01:06 - number of questions lined up for hottie
01:08 - but before we dive into those I wanted
01:09 - to ask howdy to share a few opening
01:12 - words how do you do you want to go ahead
01:13 - and do that sure ad is this working I
01:19 - think it's working it in first for
01:23 - anybody who's dying and i should say
01:25 - this is our first time doing it
01:27 - dismissed format melissa is literally in
01:29 - the room right next door so that the
01:32 - fact that we're on different screens is
01:34 - kind of funny code.org is a slightly
01:38 - larger organization than the tiny tiny
01:41 - startup it was two years ago at but
01:43 - we're still a pretty small bootstrap
01:45 - startup so we're kind of figure
01:47 - everything out as we go ad and this is
01:50 - our first of these teacher community
01:52 - style ad online hangouts we are hopeful
01:55 - to do at least one a month to sort of
01:57 - build it in the community in touch with
02:01 - lesson to hear their questions and to
02:04 - help inspire people I want to briefly
02:06 - talk about just a quick state of the
02:08 - world of what code org does at an
02:11 - this is going to be more about beyond
02:13 - the hour of code every I think I think
02:15 - everybody here is aware of the hour of
02:16 - code campaign it's probably the headline
02:19 - effort of what co.org does but the four
02:22 - other bullets here are the things that
02:23 - we actually spend the most of our time
02:25 - on and that's what I personally focused
02:27 - the most on at one creating fantastic
02:29 - curriculum as online courses for
02:32 - students to take but more actually
02:34 - directly thinking about the classroom
02:37 - and giving teachers a tool that they can
02:39 - use to teach computer science even if
02:41 - they have them before at the second is
02:43 - partnership with school districts to add
02:45 - computer science the curriculum add
02:47 - which then quickly gets into doing
02:49 - teacher training and hosting
02:51 - professional development workshops to
02:53 - prepare non CS teachers to become CS
02:55 - teachers and lastly changing state and
02:58 - in some cases federal policies to help
03:00 - bolster computer science and to quickly
03:02 - summarize where we are with these things
03:03 - had I think you need to click on the
03:06 - animation scrubbers controlling these
03:08 - our metrics of success at first of all
03:11 - is that our online courses now reach six
03:13 - million students we're now in
03:15 - partnerships with 70 school districts
03:17 - had we've trained 15,000 teachers and we
03:21 - have changed policies in 18 different
03:23 - states now all of these are pretty
03:25 - insanely big numbers for a two year old
03:28 - organization at that's kind of just
03:31 - figuring things out the hardest of these
03:33 - by four has been at the 15,000 teachers
03:36 - having gone through PD workshops you
03:39 - know we we I think are one of the
03:40 - largest PD organizations in the country
03:42 - at this point with the number of
03:45 - teachers that have gone through our
03:47 - pediat although I would say that most of
03:49 - that is going through one day PD in our
03:50 - elementary school program focusing on
03:53 - the six million students had something
03:56 - that's somewhat insane is just that the
03:58 - scale of this work code studio our
04:00 - learning platform was only launched at
04:02 - less than two years ago it's now has a
04:05 - hundred and fifty thousand teachers on
04:07 - the platform and six million students
04:10 - we've had seven billion lines of code
04:12 - written by students as you probably know
04:14 - these lines of code are just dragging
04:16 - and dropping at code but still the fact
04:18 - that that's been done seven billion
04:20 - times is pretty crazy and most
04:22 - importantly ten percent of all
04:25 - elementary and middle school students in
04:26 - the united states have created an
04:28 - account on the platform which is at a
04:31 - stunning success not just for code or
04:33 - but for the 150,000 teachers that have
04:36 - gotten engaged in bringing this to their
04:38 - students and then lastly the thing that
04:40 - I'm probably the most excited about is
04:42 - the diversity at these students when you
04:45 - when you look at the tech industry in
04:47 - general you see a very very under
04:49 - sticker when you look at the code org
04:52 - student body it's almost perfectly
04:55 - balanced with diversity we still have a
04:57 - little bit of room to go on the gender
04:59 - of our students and if you take out the
05:02 - students that basically sign up for
05:03 - code.org at home and look at the ones
05:05 - that are in classrooms it's actually a
05:07 - perfectly balanced as to in an audience
05:09 - which basically proves out the theory we
05:11 - had that if you teach this in school
05:13 - where all the kids are it becomes
05:16 - something that no longer represents the
05:18 - stereotypes that people bring to
05:19 - technology and you know out of our six
05:23 - million students were now at the point
05:24 - that there's two million women and too
05:26 - many two million black and Hispanic
05:28 - students on the platform and those
05:30 - numbers are gigantic compared to the
05:32 - traditional software computer science
05:34 - space you know to put it in perspective
05:37 - u.s. University's Graduate eight
05:40 - thousand women a year in computer
05:41 - science and the entire software
05:43 - engineering profession in the United
05:45 - States is 500,000 women you know our
05:48 - elementary and middle school girls
05:50 - aren't software engineers but the fact
05:52 - that those two million of them relative
05:53 - to 8,000 and university is still a huge
05:56 - deal so computer science just through a
06:01 - few years ago was this sort of little
06:03 - field that could and had a small number
06:05 - of people that wanted it to grow it's
06:07 - now become the fastest spreading course
06:09 - in public education and the schools that
06:11 - offer it they see record enrollment by
06:13 - students this is a picture of the AP
06:17 - computer science class just in the last
06:18 - few years at where you know 2013 and
06:22 - beyond its been at the fastest growing
06:24 - course in the in the 2010s decade but we
06:28 - still have a long long way to go
06:29 - ninety-five percent of high schools
06:31 - don't even teach computer science at the
06:33 - AP level and seventy-five percent of
06:35 - high schools don't teach any form of
06:37 - computer programming
06:38 - that's it for my quick sort of state of
06:41 - the world of cobourg and computer
06:44 - science and mainly I wanted to just open
06:47 - things up to a QA ad I'm happy to be
06:50 - here and answer whatever questions
06:52 - people have for me thanks so much Hattie
06:56 - so we have a number of questions i'm
06:58 - already queued up for you and for folks
07:00 - who have further questions for Hattie we
07:02 - would really love to make this an
07:03 - interactive session so if you could go
07:05 - ahead and type your questions into the
07:07 - chat pod on blue jeans or tweet them at
07:10 - teach code hashtag move forward I mean
07:13 - if we have time later on in the session
07:15 - I can also call on folks individually to
07:17 - turn their mics on and off and actually
07:19 - speak and have a dialogue which I think
07:20 - would be really fun as well so how do
07:23 - you justice or not much preferred I'd
07:25 - much prefer to have Mike's going turning
07:27 - on an office of as it's super impersonal
07:29 - it'll feel weird for me yes sorry and I
07:31 - know that's totally that's totally a
07:33 - good idea I think the one of the what
07:35 - best ways to manage that is if you have
07:37 - a webcam tonight and you want to turn it
07:38 - on your picture will show up along the
07:41 - bottom of the screen so I can see Joel
07:43 - and Alana already and Joel Alana or
07:46 - anyone who's webcam is on if you'd like
07:48 - to ask patty a question you can raise
07:50 - your hand physically then I can call on
07:53 - you a one-on-one right so the Joel just
07:56 - waved to us so i could say Joel unmute
07:57 - yourself and ask us a question and Joel
08:00 - I know you actually did post a question
08:03 - on Twitter's evening so maybe you want
08:04 - to kick us off by asking that one
08:08 - oh hello hello hottie how you doing
08:11 - today
08:13 - that's right the question I see is what
08:15 - I get a lot from from teachers and from
08:17 - legislators is is where do you see this
08:19 - movement going like what is your what's
08:22 - your five-year plan what you know what
08:23 - do you see where do you see code organ
08:25 - five-year or DC computer science in five
08:27 - years you know what's the what's the big
08:30 - picture you know so so in its so much so
08:32 - many of us work in the classroom but
08:33 - look at the small picture in daily basis
08:35 - looks like the big overarching picture
08:37 - that you guys see yourselves in 3 5 7
08:40 - years sure you know my my long term view
08:43 - is that computer science belongs in the
08:47 - curriculum in a similar place as
08:49 - something like biology or chemistry or
08:52 - pick a subfield of math and you know
08:56 - those nobody questions why those things
08:58 - are being taught in schools there's no
09:00 - effort to try to get biology into the
09:02 - school system it just is at and there's
09:05 - no biology org that exists to help make
09:10 - sure people are teaching biology it's
09:11 - just part of the system so our long-term
09:13 - goal is to get computer science to have
09:16 - that same position but if you look at it
09:19 - feel like biology you know that the
09:21 - field has existed for a long time at you
09:24 - know it people were studying biology I
09:27 - think before schools existed but if you
09:29 - look at more recent fields you know
09:31 - electricity has only been studied for
09:33 - about a few hundred years but it's in
09:36 - most schools kids learn how a light bulb
09:38 - works and how batteries work and many
09:40 - many schools certainly more than
09:42 - computer science have a physics class
09:45 - that teaches more about electromagnetism
09:47 - and etc so getting computer science to
09:50 - reach its place in the world alongside
09:52 - those fields is our long-term goal add
09:55 - and my hope is that at some point is
09:57 - that in 10 years is that in 20 years or
09:59 - is it sooner that code.org can move to a
10:01 - model that is more about supporting
10:03 - something that's already in the school
10:04 - system had but between now and there
10:07 - we're doing everything we can to get
10:09 - ourselves there and that's working both
10:12 - top down and bottoms up at the same time
10:14 - you know at the top down level we're
10:16 - trying to get states and governments and
10:19 - in some cases even countries to pass
10:22 - regulations that either required
10:24 - Computer Sciences taught or at least
10:26 - support it when it is taught you know
10:28 - right now when we started computer
10:30 - science was kind of this bastard
10:31 - stepchild of the education system and if
10:34 - you're a computer science teacher you
10:35 - need to constantly kind of advocate why
10:38 - you even exist I don't think that
10:41 - there's too many computer science
10:42 - teachers that feel that way anymore had
10:44 - you know if anything that they're being
10:46 - asked you know offered new jobs at other
10:48 - schools and it's become a much more
10:49 - hotly demanded field but you know the
10:52 - top down approach alone isn't enough if
10:55 - you look at a country like the UK
10:56 - they've made a top-down mandate that
10:58 - every school must teach this and
11:00 - everybody's kind of at the school level
11:02 - rolling their eyes and wondering is that
11:04 - what's it going to mean and they look
11:06 - you know there's other top-down mandates
11:07 - in the American education system that
11:10 - you look at top-down mandates don't have
11:13 - fantastic teacher response so really
11:16 - co.org is a lot more about the bottoms
11:18 - up grassroots movement really led by
11:20 - teachers and empowering teachers who
11:22 - believe that this is right for their
11:23 - students and so the majority of our work
11:26 - is supporting those teachers to just put
11:28 - this in the classroom and then to
11:30 - develop a enough teacher capacity to let
11:33 - the administration's frankly catch up
11:35 - with what's happening on the ground
11:35 - anyway thanks Hattie a related question
11:41 - that came to us through the chat pod
11:43 - here in blue jeans what are you seeing
11:45 - across the different states in terms of
11:46 - teacher licensing and how quickly are we
11:48 - moving towards CS certification um
11:52 - that's a great question I put that in
11:55 - the context of a number of policy
11:58 - related questions that really can't be
12:00 - resolved by individual teachers you know
12:02 - if you're a individual teacher you can
12:04 - just start introducing concepts to your
12:06 - kids and nobody will you know to tell
12:10 - you exactly how you should or shouldn't
12:11 - do that but there's a whole bunch of
12:13 - state policy issues that really only the
12:15 - state can resolve it's something the
12:17 - federal government can't do your your
12:19 - individual principal or school district
12:21 - can't do either at one of those as
12:23 - standards one of those is teacher
12:25 - licensing and credentialing another them
12:28 - is what are the requirements for what a
12:30 - school of Ed should be teaching
12:32 - pre-service teachers you know because
12:34 - one of the most important things that
12:36 - that happens in our education system
12:38 - that is overlooked is
12:39 - the schools of Education which are
12:41 - graduating thousands of teachers a year
12:43 - and those teachers come with the sort of
12:46 - they're already set up learning and
12:49 - knowing how to teach biology for example
12:51 - but you know that the incoming graduates
12:53 - each year don't have the computer
12:55 - science skills all of these pieces need
12:57 - to be adjusted at the state level we
12:59 - have an extremely small team it's one
13:02 - person that now just we just hired
13:04 - somebody new so it's two people who are
13:05 - working with the various states on these
13:08 - issues and the work that code org does
13:10 - is mostly helping States just wrap their
13:13 - mind around what needs to be changed add
13:15 - and sort of supporting states that care
13:18 - about this enough to go forward add
13:20 - actually enjoy stay the last question um
13:23 - Joel state is one of the leading states
13:25 - in terms of passing a comprehensive
13:28 - legislative package to basically drive
13:30 - computer science throughout the state
13:31 - happen but teacher certification in
13:34 - particular comes up it's a little gnarly
13:35 - because in some cases you have science
13:39 - or math teachers who've learned a little
13:41 - bit of cs in some cases you have
13:43 - software professionals who've learned a
13:45 - little bit of teaching and both of those
13:48 - are already in classrooms and at any
13:51 - state that wants to set up licensing
13:53 - rules for sure needs to grandfather and
13:55 - whoever's already teaching CS had the
13:58 - worst thing that could happen is kind of
14:00 - getting existing CS teachers told that
14:02 - you can't do it anymore unless you get a
14:03 - certificate but we do need to get states
14:06 - to establish policies to at least define
14:09 - what what it means to be a CS teacher
14:11 - because without that you can't get
14:13 - schools abed actually producing CS
14:14 - teachers and you need to set some bar so
14:17 - so it organizations such as code over
14:19 - know what to aim for we're actually
14:21 - about to publish sort of a draft
14:24 - recommendation for states to adopt for
14:26 - teacher licensing and we're in
14:27 - conversations with a number of states
14:29 - about this issue
14:33 - great there's some really great
14:35 - questions in the chat pod from Brittany
14:37 - and Kathy I don't know if either of you
14:39 - have a mic would like to meet and then
14:41 - Angie I see your hand as well Brittany
14:43 - did you want to ask your question about
14:45 - curriculum let's see I can ask it for
14:55 - her as well so Brittany said that she's
14:59 - recently been brought on board to build
15:00 - the STEM program in their school hottie
15:02 - in the school district rather and she
15:04 - wonders what advice you have on what you
15:06 - think is a must for middle and high
15:07 - school students they're already doing
15:09 - code.org so what else should middle and
15:11 - high school students see before they
15:13 - graduate in your opinion um all right hi
15:17 - Brittany had its funny we I usually
15:20 - don't use the word stem ad not just
15:24 - basically because it's a little bit
15:25 - confusing and different it means that
15:27 - different things for different people
15:28 - and it's kind of funny that the there's
15:31 - a guy at code.org who actually coined
15:33 - that word at back where he worked in
15:36 - Capitol Hill who's now at greatly
15:38 - regrets it because the amount of sort of
15:39 - multiple uses stem has and the reason I
15:43 - don't love the term is because first of
15:46 - all the average parent has no idea what
15:48 - stem is we've acted in a survey and
15:50 - seventy percent of parents don't know
15:52 - what stem means at all of them know what
15:55 - computer science means have but the real
15:57 - confusion is math and science are
16:00 - probably already being taught in your
16:02 - school so when you say you're in charge
16:04 - of stem it's probably not the M or the s
16:08 - in stem it's probably the tea and the e
16:10 - because those are the parts that aren't
16:12 - taught in most schools ad so and for the
16:15 - technology and engineering parts you
16:18 - know what co.org provides just I think
16:20 - today had initial curriculum to help
16:23 - people get started we have a program
16:25 - that basically has deeper curriculum
16:28 - that we bring to school districts but
16:29 - only when we partner directly with those
16:31 - school districts so that the the courses
16:34 - that are on our online code studio
16:35 - platform those are designed for
16:37 - elementary or early middle school
16:39 - students and we're busy working on
16:42 - rolling out of a longer deeper middle
16:45 - school course and a longer high school
16:46 - course by one years from now somewhere
16:49 - by one year for now we'll have a
16:52 - complete high school course that's like
16:54 - our elementary school courses and by two
16:56 - years from now we'll have a complete
16:57 - middle school course as well we don't
16:59 - have those a hundred percent done yet
17:02 - we're piloting the high school course
17:03 - right now will be piloting the middle
17:05 - school course next year but an interim
17:08 - there's a ton of additional resources I
17:10 - would look at you know at the high
17:11 - school level had frankly if you go to
17:14 - code org slash educate / third-party
17:17 - you'll see all of our recommendations
17:19 - for courses had the ones I'd give
17:21 - shoutouts to add if you want a sort of
17:25 - purely online formats either Khan
17:28 - Academy's computer programming course or
17:30 - the code HS computer programming course
17:32 - are really great ones and don't require
17:35 - a teacher to have gone through a PD
17:37 - program beforehand but if you want to
17:39 - have you the teachers in your district
17:41 - to go through PD there's a bunch of
17:43 - other sub providers alongside co.org
17:46 - cool they see give training to the
17:47 - existing teaching staff to integrate
17:49 - computer science and we're all about
17:52 - computer science but since you said stem
17:54 - I think you should for sure look at a
17:56 - number of the various robotics or maker
17:58 - type opportunities out there we we don't
18:01 - really do much the sort of maker
18:03 - movement at not because we dislike it
18:06 - but just because we focus on computer
18:07 - science
18:09 - alright Angie thank God Angie hi so my
18:15 - question kind of goes off of Joel's
18:17 - question and it's what are some unique
18:20 - or interesting jobs that you have run
18:23 - into in the computer science field or
18:25 - people that you've met and you're like
18:27 - wow that's a great job more people
18:29 - should know about that so that we can
18:31 - bring those to our teachers and our
18:33 - students you mean do mean jobs for
18:36 - software engineers or people who have
18:38 - learned computer programming yeah yep um
18:43 - yeah the the things I mentioned for
18:47 - stuff like this aren't just people who
18:48 - have cool jobs are usually things that
18:50 - stretch people's vision of what computer
18:53 - programming or software impacts and we
18:57 - actually are about to release a video
18:58 - specific to this as part of our new
19:01 - computer science principles course just
19:04 - to show how far is changing literally
19:06 - every industry for me the most extreme
19:10 - one of this is the impact that software
19:14 - has had on ornithology most people I
19:17 - haven't even heard of Ornithology
19:18 - ornithology is the study of birds at so
19:22 - bird-watching has been around for I
19:24 - think I don't know for as long as people
19:26 - have existed some some of them have
19:28 - watched birds um but recently
19:30 - ornithologists made a breakthrough
19:32 - learning in ornithology which is
19:34 - understanding why birds fly in a V ad
19:37 - and you know you may wonder why do black
19:40 - birds fly in a V why aren't they in a
19:42 - different shape while I am just a
19:43 - straight line and computer scientists
19:47 - basically attached little GPS devices to
19:49 - all these bird's wings to measure their
19:52 - exact position relative to each other to
19:54 - find out why they fly in a V and they
19:55 - found out that you know when the front
19:57 - bird flaps their wings the air is pushed
20:00 - down and then over the next two words
20:01 - birds fly on top of that air the air
20:03 - comes back up and so each bird's wings
20:06 - help lift the next bird which use
20:11 - software to
20:12 - if you look at any field you can find
20:14 - things like that in the field of
20:15 - Agriculture there's a startup that makes
20:18 - a product called lettuce spot which is
20:20 - this gigantic robot on wheels that is
20:23 - that you drive it over a field and it's
20:26 - the front of the robot is scanning the
20:28 - lettuce you know taking pictures of it
20:31 - and analyzing it and by the time the
20:33 - back of the robot gets to the lettuce
20:35 - it's like kind of a long truck with all
20:37 - these cameras in the front and all these
20:39 - things in the back and the front of it
20:41 - is scanning the lettuce in the back of
20:42 - it is spraying things on the lettuce and
20:44 - each lettuce gets a different treatment
20:46 - based on what the picture of the front
20:48 - of the robot saw at which you know
20:51 - instead of having individuals look at a
20:54 - lettuce and spray something differently
20:55 - you just drive on top of them and it
20:57 - does the job have you know things in
21:01 - entertainment or communication that are
21:03 - just see so I usually look at the fields
21:06 - that you don't think of as being
21:07 - impacted by technology had certainly
21:11 - transportation in space and things like
21:12 - that when you see people like Elon Musk
21:14 - it's an interesting thing in Detroit the
21:18 - home of the auto industry the most
21:20 - wanted job is for software engineers not
21:23 - for mechanics or manufacturers or so on
21:28 - so honey there's a little bit of
21:30 - discussion going on in the chat pod
21:31 - related to what you were saying about
21:33 - our middle school and high school pilots
21:35 - there's been a couple different kinds of
21:37 - questions some teachers have asked you
21:40 - know I started teaching code.org this
21:42 - year what am I going to do next year
21:43 - what do you what are you going to have
21:44 - ready for me similarly I'm in Australia
21:48 - what can I do when is code data or
21:50 - partnership coming here so I think folks
21:52 - would love to hear from you about sort
21:55 - of how you would approach this year and
21:57 - next year and how teachers can use what
22:00 - we have and then also plan for the
22:01 - future sure that you know I'll mention
22:07 - the Australia one first which is that we
22:09 - have our hands pretty full with the
22:11 - United States mmm partly because it's a
22:14 - big country but also because it's an
22:16 - incredibly decentralized education
22:18 - system and there's a whole lot of other
22:20 - countries that are just top-down saying
22:23 - we're just going to teach computer
22:24 - science in every single classroom and
22:25 - that's just done you know Australia
22:28 - actually just recently announced that at
22:30 - South Korea though the UK and a year ago
22:34 - in the u.s. each individual state would
22:38 - need to do that except for those states
22:40 - that constitutionally can't in which
22:42 - case each individual school district we
22:43 - need to do that so add you know solving
22:46 - the problem in the u.s. separate from
22:48 - the size of the population is like
22:49 - dealing with 50 different countries add
22:51 - so we focus our advocacy efforts and our
22:55 - teacher training and professional
22:56 - development and district management
22:58 - efforts in the US but our curriculum is
23:01 - being used globally already and
23:03 - certainly in english-speaking countries
23:04 - everything we produce for the u.s. is
23:06 - available in those countries and in the
23:09 - non-english speaking countries that we
23:11 - have volunteers that help us translate
23:12 - and we're always looking for more
23:14 - translation volunteers with respect to
23:17 - our online courses AB and it's a really
23:21 - tough balance to deal with what's the
23:23 - right amount to provide for the teacher
23:24 - who's just getting started versus the
23:26 - teacher who's like gotten into it and
23:28 - loves it and just want me once more so
23:30 - one thing will be start doing is in our
23:33 - courses right now they just have numbers
23:34 - here's course one hears course 2 here's
23:36 - course three at one thing we recently
23:38 - decided as we want to differentiate sort
23:40 - of the core poor
23:41 - the course from the bonus materials so
23:43 - that you know everybody can do course
23:45 - one the short version and then if you
23:47 - want more of course when you could do
23:48 - the bonus materials at and our fourth
23:52 - course in that sequence is still not
23:53 - done yet it's got a little beta tag on
23:55 - it but for sure if your kids are zooming
23:58 - through courses two and three at course
24:01 - for when it's done is going to be much
24:04 - harder to zoom through it will have much
24:06 - more challenging programming puzzles in
24:08 - it and our CS principles course it's not
24:12 - nearly as student driven and so on
24:15 - that's designed for high school but both
24:16 - are both the upcoming courses I
24:18 - mentioned are going to be relying a lot
24:19 - more on teacher facilitation have you
24:23 - know the top feedback we get about our
24:25 - elementary school courses are that they
24:28 - don't leave as much room for
24:29 - project-based creativity and they're
24:31 - more about just here's a puzzle solve
24:33 - the puzzle and the project-based
24:35 - creativity is way more exciting for the
24:37 - students but it also is harder for the
24:39 - teachers because we can't as code or we
24:43 - can't tell if you made a good project or
24:44 - a bad project you need somebody else to
24:47 - sort of review that work and help you
24:48 - build whatever it is you want to build
24:50 - so that's why we started with the
24:52 - puzzles because that kind of reduces the
24:55 - teachers have onus in terms of knowing
24:57 - the field themselves
25:01 - thanks Hattie I'm just going to pull up
25:03 - more web cams here in case there are
25:05 - folks who'd like to ask how do you
25:06 - question you can bet and raise your hand
25:08 - gasps testing with the tie your hands a
25:11 - lot I don't know if you have a question
25:12 - or if you're just adjusting I also don't
25:15 - know your names I apologize for that but
25:17 - if you like to ask adding a question
25:18 - feel free anyone else that would like to
25:20 - ask the question just raise your hand
25:21 - with your mic ha be a fun question here
25:25 - what's your favorite unplugged activity
25:26 - and why
25:30 - I don't actually know the name of the
25:31 - unplugged activity but I'll say I'm the
25:34 - one that is my favorite I had a small
25:37 - role in creating it so that may be part
25:39 - of the why um although I think the
25:41 - reason that created it is because it's
25:43 - my favorite not the other way around um
25:45 - but it's the unplugged activity that
25:47 - teaches how packets work on the internet
25:51 - and how information is travelled in
25:53 - packets between routers going from the
25:55 - source of the destination where there's
25:57 - little pieces of paper and kids need to
25:58 - pass it from person to person until it
26:01 - gets to its end goal and the reason I
26:04 - like that is because it's actually quite
26:08 - easy to do you just have little you know
26:10 - little pieces of paper that show the
26:12 - destinations address on them and you had
26:14 - them from person to person and one thing
26:16 - you quickly realize as kids is you don't
26:19 - need to do or thank you Mike for
26:21 - pointing out it's called relay
26:23 - programming at the ad but you quickly
26:27 - realize as kids you don't need a lot of
26:28 - instructions to basically hand the
26:32 - package to know which direction to send
26:35 - the packet to to eventually get it to
26:36 - your goal you know you see this one
26:38 - needs to go to Bob and you just look and
26:40 - see whoever's between you and Bob and
26:42 - you give it to that person add and add
26:47 - basically as an individual you do the
26:50 - exact same thing that a router does and
26:52 - a router doesn't know how the entire
26:54 - internet works it just knows who's on
26:55 - which direction and sends it to in that
26:58 - direction so how do we think that one's
27:02 - actually called the Internet Mike Harvey
27:04 - favorite uncle Hubbins I've brought
27:06 - oakham what you saw that we have made it
27:11 - kind of a big commitment to unplugged in
27:12 - our curriculum why what do you think the
27:14 - benefit is of having unplugged and
27:16 - plugged lessons side by side um it's
27:20 - funny this is probably a topic of a lot
27:22 - of vigorous debate at you know I never
27:25 - did any unplugged exercises when I
27:27 - learned computer science so i can't
27:30 - speak from personal experience in terms
27:33 - of the benefit from my own learning but
27:36 - i know there's a number of benefits of
27:38 - unplugged exercises one is at the
27:40 - elementary grades for sure add
27:43 - it's just useful to get the kids up and
27:45 - moving you know kids especially boys
27:49 - just need to like let out some energy
27:51 - and and add if you just force them to
27:54 - have their heads in front of the
27:55 - computers that they might not sort of
27:57 - get a chance to do that and often their
27:59 - parents don't want to see their kids
28:01 - have their heads and screens the entire
28:03 - time so those little is just sort of
28:05 - physical you know social reasons to do
28:07 - it um but the other reason is there's an
28:11 - equity reason which is that if you start
28:12 - computer science just with coding a
28:14 - bunch of kids will already know it and a
28:16 - bunch of kids won't and the ones who
28:19 - don't already have some experience on
28:21 - day one they feel like I'm the worst
28:22 - student in the class and everybody else
28:24 - already knows this and I'm bad and
28:26 - they're good or as if you start with an
28:28 - unplugged lesson most likely none of the
28:30 - kids have done that and it's just about
28:32 - pure problem solving and you know the
28:35 - kid who didn't go to an after-school
28:37 - summer camp can start at the same level
28:39 - and not feel sort of left out or fallen
28:43 - behind and that's also a very valuable
28:44 - reason the last reason is there are a
28:47 - whole bunch of things that you don't
28:48 - actually learn from from just writing
28:51 - code that and that's part of why the
28:53 - internet unplug lesson is the one I
28:55 - mentioned had because there's no like
28:58 - computer programming sort of problems
29:01 - that that teaches you how at how the
29:03 - internet works as a packet-switched
29:04 - Network that's not a computer
29:06 - programming topic it is a computer
29:08 - science topic but if you want to teach
29:10 - it you you need something different than
29:13 - just writing a computer program in order
29:14 - to teach it and that's that unplug
29:16 - lesson does a really good job
29:19 - so how do we have a question from a
29:22 - frame who's Mike is not working but he
29:24 - would like to know what's code.org doing
29:26 - to reach students of color and get them
29:29 - interested in computer science um that's
29:32 - a great question add you know we care a
29:35 - ton about diversity except that it's not
29:39 - in our name and the reason it's not in
29:41 - our name is because you know you see a
29:42 - lot of organizations who have one
29:44 - particular diversity goal in there in
29:48 - the tightly know if they're girls who
29:50 - code or girl develop it or black girls
29:53 - who code or etc at we're just code org
29:57 - and the reason is because we think all
29:59 - kids should get exposed to this and the
30:01 - most fundamental way we do that is by
30:03 - aiming to get this into the school
30:05 - system ad and you know if you look at
30:09 - the average school classroom it's a very
30:11 - diverse classroom and you have diversity
30:14 - there already and so if we get the
30:17 - average school classroom to teach
30:18 - computer science then we actually solve
30:20 - the diversity problem that's kind of
30:21 - kind of a hand wavy answer so I'll just
30:23 - go to actual specifics of things we're
30:26 - doing and one thing is you know when we
30:29 - make district partnerships we're focused
30:31 - on the largest school districts in the
30:34 - country which happen to also have the
30:36 - most underprivileged kids which happen
30:38 - to also have the most black and Hispanic
30:39 - kids so we're in New York City Chicago
30:41 - Los Angeles Miami Las Vegas at Broward
30:45 - County Houston at these seven districts
30:48 - alone have about fifteen percent of the
30:50 - black and Hispanic population in the
30:52 - country had and in fact in our courses
30:54 - in those school districts were you know
30:56 - are thirty-seven percent overall black
30:59 - and Hispanic population is much smaller
31:01 - than what it is in those school
31:02 - districts where we have a sixty percent
31:04 - black and Hispanic population in the
31:07 - sort of code or classroom at the other
31:10 - thing that we do is to make sure the
31:12 - people in our videos represent a diverse
31:15 - group and this is a pretty hard thing to
31:19 - do em and kind of funny when you think
31:21 - about the work that we end up doing but
31:23 - every video we make we we keep track of
31:25 - how many white people are there in the
31:27 - video how many black people how many
31:29 - brown people how many boys how many
31:30 - girls how many old how many young
31:33 - you know to make sure that we don't have
31:35 - too much of anything and to just
31:37 - represent this as a field that everybody
31:39 - participates in and we also try to make
31:41 - sure we don't have too many you know
31:43 - social media website game developer
31:46 - people so we have people working from
31:49 - medicine or people working from
31:51 - entertainment or so on to show that this
31:53 - is not just about building a website or
31:55 - building an app and it's also just about
31:57 - building things that impact any parts of
31:59 - society had lastly the facilitators who
32:03 - do at who hosts professional development
32:06 - workshops for us are also a very ethnic
32:09 - group at and so if you look at the
32:12 - traditional computer scientists the
32:14 - traditional computer scientists is
32:16 - generally a white male in terms of the
32:19 - teachers in the classroom it's the only
32:21 - field of teaching where there's more men
32:23 - who are teachers than women had whereas
32:26 - if you look at our pd facilitators
32:29 - they're more women than men and that
32:31 - alone is it had an important thing for
32:33 - us thanks Hattie I've noticed a few
32:38 - folks have joined us sort of Midway so
32:40 - just to remind everybody if you have
32:41 - questions for had a you can put them in
32:43 - the chat pod here on blue jeans or tweet
32:45 - them with at teach code howdy what was
32:49 - your proudest moment at code data code
32:51 - dad work so far um my proudest moment
32:56 - was also my most shameful moments was
32:59 - kind of a weird extreme of both but it
33:03 - was basically standing in the White
33:05 - House as the president walked in to do
33:08 - his very brief hour of code and said how
33:13 - amazing co.org and he said coder is
33:15 - doing amazing thing for our country as
33:17 - amazing organization and in the back I
33:20 - mind our website was down because too
33:21 - many other people were doing the hour of
33:23 - code so I didn't know whether to you
33:26 - know jump up for joy or cry or as kind
33:28 - of trying to do both at the same time um
33:30 - but it definitely was I don't think
33:33 - there's anything more special than
33:34 - having you know the president of your
33:36 - country call out your work especially
33:38 - just 22 years after we started so that
33:42 - was pretty awesome
33:44 - that's great as a similar fun question
33:52 - have you coded while surfing I know the
33:54 - answer to this one um actually yeah
33:57 - that's kind of for people who don't know
34:00 - the background at my favorite thing to
34:02 - do on the side is wakesurfing which is
34:04 - kind of like waterskiing surfboard ad
34:08 - and you know surfing the wave created by
34:12 - a boat ad but yes I have that's actually
34:15 - I learned you know once you learn how to
34:17 - surf behind a boat and get a certain
34:21 - level of good you can do all sorts of
34:22 - things on it ad and when we were lining
34:25 - it for the first hour of code we try to
34:27 - get all sorts of selfie videos from
34:29 - people saying you know that they had
34:31 - just done the hour of code to make this
34:34 - one compilation video and if you look on
34:36 - youtube for the hour of code is here
34:39 - you'll see a video that has all these
34:41 - little mini little selfies but somebody
34:45 - asked me to sort of while i was
34:46 - wakesurfing to say that i just did the
34:48 - hour of code so i did but then I
34:49 - realized I wasn't anywhere near a
34:51 - computer I'm so didn't come off quite as
34:54 - right so we had to do it again and give
34:56 - me a laptop so I could actually drag
34:57 - block of code and make an angry bird do
35:00 - something um so I'd solved puzzle one of
35:04 - the first hour of code tutorial on a
35:07 - surfboard and you can see it in that
35:09 - video I mentioned so so there is
35:12 - evidence out there so also if you have
35:16 - your webcam you can turn it on and raise
35:17 - your hand if you'd like to speak to
35:18 - hottie and ask a question in the
35:20 - meantime how do we have a question where
35:22 - did the whole idea for code.org come
35:24 - from what inspired you this was this
35:31 - movement has been probably the most sort
35:33 - of not pre-planned effort not enough
35:38 - other things like this are planned far
35:40 - in advance but it's kind of a little bit
35:42 - more of an accident than anything else
35:44 - add did I want I've been interested in
35:47 - computer science education for probably
35:49 - 15 years I remember graduating from
35:51 - college and wondering why isn't this a
35:52 - field you know I I'm a journey but I
35:55 - just thought why isn't everybody
35:55 - required to get at least the basic
35:57 - knowledge in this
35:58 - and you know I'm when I was graduating
36:01 - from college was right when the internet
36:03 - it was exploding and web browsers had
36:04 - been invented and so on and it just felt
36:07 - like everything in our lives was going
36:08 - to change this is important and I had
36:11 - that thought and I didn't do anything
36:12 - about it for 15 years but you know three
36:15 - years ago I decided I really should do
36:17 - something about this but I didn't decide
36:19 - I'm gonna start code or guy decided I
36:21 - just make a short youtube video to say
36:24 - that this is an important field that
36:26 - people should try it have enough
36:29 - connections in the tech industry that I
36:30 - managed to recruit some of the best
36:32 - people in the tech industry to
36:34 - participate in the video and my plan was
36:37 - you know I'll make this video and put it
36:39 - on youtube and that's it um the plan got
36:44 - bigger because I realized I can't just
36:46 - put this video in my own YouTube channel
36:48 - like you know and once it has Bill Gates
36:50 - and Mark Zuckerberg on it it needs like
36:51 - a website and then if it needs a website
36:54 - that website needs a name and my twin
36:57 - brother who was co funding the project
36:58 - with me said you should get the best
37:00 - name possible so we got the name code
37:02 - org and had basically when the original
37:08 - code.org video launched you know my
37:11 - inspiration was this an important field
37:12 - every student should learn this it
37:14 - should be in every school let's put out
37:16 - this video get the word out and then
37:17 - good things will happen and then I'll go
37:19 - back to my sort of cozy little
37:21 - retirement add the video however was so
37:25 - popular that literally 15,000 schools
37:28 - and teachers reached out saying you know
37:30 - this is awesome we want this in our
37:31 - school and there wasn't any this you
37:34 - know it was just a video and me and so I
37:37 - think the real inspiration was just the
37:41 - demand from from educators who thought
37:43 - this is a great idea and they want
37:45 - computer science in their schools and
37:47 - realizing that there's no organization
37:49 - out there that has the capacity or the
37:51 - or the tools to bring something to
37:53 - 15,000 schools at ever since then co.org
37:56 - has been this continuously trying to
37:59 - catch up and keep up with the demand in
38:01 - this space and to effectively give to
38:04 - those teachers and educators what they
38:08 - they tell us that their students wanted
38:10 - need
38:12 - thanks honey we have a question here
38:15 - about the hour of code which is coming
38:17 - up in a couple months um possibly you
38:19 - can't answer but maybe you can speak to
38:21 - other parts of what we have planned the
38:22 - question is do we have any surprise and
38:24 - quotes exciting things planned for this
38:27 - year and what should teachers be looking
38:29 - forward to so the wimpy heads is last
38:35 - year we kind of went pretty all out at
38:38 - you know between getting on an Elsa and
38:41 - a tutorial and getting the president's
38:43 - to participate in the hour of code and
38:46 - having a lucky classroom at literally
38:49 - get taken to the White House to meet the
38:51 - President and the Vice President for
38:53 - like 30 minutes there's no way we can
38:56 - top any of that so and I want to at
39:01 - April just asked about the Pope yeah I
39:05 - want to sort of kind of remove any
39:08 - expectations of us trying to top
39:09 - ourselves each year on this and in fact
39:11 - might we need to quickly shift the hour
39:14 - of code from it's this thing that code
39:17 - org does that is bigger than last year's
39:19 - each year to this thing that just
39:21 - schools and teachers do and you know if
39:24 - you look at something like Earth Day
39:25 - there's no organization that organizes
39:28 - Earth Day people just do stuff and as an
39:31 - organization we at code or we need to
39:33 - figure out how to hand over the reins of
39:34 - different pieces of this to effectively
39:38 - the third the education system and
39:41 - educators to take over it had that said
39:45 - we have some pretty awesome things
39:47 - coming up this year which I can't really
39:48 - tell you about with respect to the Pope
39:51 - in particular add that is I think the
39:55 - only person we can think of add that
39:58 - could either top or equal the president
40:00 - at and I just happen to go to Italy last
40:04 - week for a at four because our partner
40:07 - that really wanted us to meet with them
40:09 - for Italian issues but while we were
40:11 - they they also said that had you know
40:13 - they had independently thought how could
40:15 - get the Pope involved so we're going to
40:17 - make a shot at it if any of you know the
40:20 - Pope please let me know add but there
40:24 - there's definitely a
40:25 - outs we have to get to him so we're
40:27 - going to give it a try you know if there
40:29 - was ever a pope that would consider like
40:32 - writing a line of code it's definitely
40:33 - this poke at that that's certainly for
40:36 - sure at but I have no idea if he's at
40:40 - all interested I have no idea what the
40:41 - process is for booking the coach and but
40:44 - but we're trying from the standpoint by
40:47 - the way of tutorials we have to kick ass
40:50 - awesome tutorials that we're working on
40:52 - em and I don't know if every one of your
40:54 - students have tried all the other of our
40:55 - tutorials so even if it's not the new
40:57 - ones the existing ones are still quite
40:59 - good but we'll have two new ones that
41:01 - are both add over the top and in some
41:04 - ways better than all the ones we've done
41:05 - before
41:06 - and this year we're also soliciting
41:09 - lesson plans from teachers right howdy
41:12 - yes one thing we're actually about to
41:14 - announce this is actually a pretty big
41:16 - deal um but I do want to mention because
41:19 - I just saw on the chat pod that somebody
41:21 - mentioned the Pope wearing the coat or
41:22 - hat and if we get the Pope we're gonna
41:25 - have to design a special white white on
41:28 - white co.org hats just to see if that
41:32 - would be possible for him to wear i'm
41:33 - not sure if it's possible i'm bad but in
41:37 - terms of the teacher in terms of a
41:40 - teacher created lesson plans one thing
41:42 - that the past hours of code have all had
41:44 - is the sense of effectively here's this
41:47 - game tutorial put it in front of your
41:48 - kids hit play they'll learn to code
41:51 - which has been an easy way to get
41:53 - teachers involved especially the
41:55 - teachers who don't know anything because
41:56 - they don't really need to know anything
41:58 - themselves because the thing kind of
42:00 - runs itself at that said it kind of had
42:06 - you know none of us believe that
42:08 - teachers don't need to know anything and
42:10 - there's a lot of teachers who are much
42:11 - better than that but the tutorials we've
42:13 - created don't actually provide an outlet
42:17 - for what should the teacher do other
42:18 - then look over kids shoulders and try to
42:20 - help here and there and there's lots of
42:22 - teachers who would want to have a more
42:24 - traditional lesson plan that they can
42:27 - use and facilitate there's a similar
42:30 - opportunity there's a lot of teachers
42:31 - who don't do the hour of code because
42:33 - they think the hour of code is for the
42:34 - tech teacher rather than for them so
42:38 - we're going to be opening up a call for
42:40 - any teacher who wants to create a lesson
42:42 - plan for the hour of code with a
42:44 - specific call to action which is to try
42:46 - to design it specific to an English
42:48 - teacher or specific to a history teacher
42:50 - or specific to a I don't know algebra
42:53 - teacher geometry teacher at and it can
42:56 - be an unplugged thing or it can be a
42:57 - blood thing and it doesn't need to be a
42:59 - special game featuring you know plants
43:02 - vs zombies it could just be a google doc
43:04 - or whatever at telling a teacher how to
43:07 - facilitate something and you know
43:09 - something that's effectively for the
43:10 - teacher who wants to plan an evening in
43:13 - advance and read through it and learn it
43:16 - and practice it or whatnot you know with
43:19 - 70,000 teachers having done the hour of
43:21 - code I'm sure there's at least 10,000
43:23 - who would want to go do that and i'm
43:25 - sure there's 10,000 more in other
43:28 - classrooms that would want to do that so
43:30 - hopefully we'll get some really cool
43:31 - lessons and we're going to have a
43:33 - community of teachers that helps us q8
43:35 - those lessons so any of you here you can
43:38 - help on either side of that if your if
43:40 - your experience whether it's to create
43:41 - lesson plans or to help us sort through
43:43 - the things we get and see which ones are
43:45 - good at that's part of how we'd like to
43:47 - sort of hand over the reins of the hour
43:49 - of code to the broader education
43:50 - community
43:53 - so we're coming down towards the end of
43:55 - our hour here had a just a couple more
43:57 - questions for you a couple of folks in
43:59 - the chat pod asking about our recent on
44:01 - cost analysis that we put out with our
44:04 - evaluation reports if you could talk a
44:06 - little bit towards the funding and and
44:09 - how much it costs to train a teacher and
44:11 - what you think the sustainability of the
44:13 - movement is sure so for anybody who
44:16 - didn't see it we recently announced our
44:18 - analysis of our cost per teacher who we
44:21 - effectively trained at and at the
44:25 - elementary school level our cost is a
44:27 - hundred and fifty dollars per teacher at
44:29 - the middle school level it's a little
44:30 - over two thousand at the high school
44:33 - level it's about forty five hundred
44:34 - dollars per teacher that isn't money
44:38 - that goes to the teacher or it adds up a
44:41 - whole lot of things in some cases
44:45 - actually it includes money that goes to
44:46 - the teacher in middle school in high
44:47 - school in our first cohort of teachers
44:50 - we also paid the full stipend for the
44:52 - teacher to attend PD in elementary
44:54 - school we don't pay stipends for PD F
44:57 - and in middle school in high school over
44:59 - time we'll probably migrate to a model
45:00 - where we don't pay stipends for PT we're
45:02 - already in our new school agreements
45:04 - we're only going to cover half of those
45:06 - costs where we pay it to the district in
45:09 - the district and can pay it out to the
45:10 - teacher um what we look at for the cost
45:13 - is everything that needs to be paid by
45:16 - us for the outcome that we want to
45:18 - happen whether that includes supplies
45:21 - for the PD workshop whether that
45:23 - includes catering for the PD workshop
45:25 - paying the venue paying our own staff
45:28 - whoever it took to even talk to the
45:31 - school district to decide to have a PD
45:33 - workshop in the first place at
45:35 - everything add you know the code org add
45:41 - the reason we do this frankly is because
45:42 - I've looked at this as this is something
45:44 - that our entire country needs which
45:46 - means rather than thinking how do we
45:48 - host a PD workshop for 30 people
45:50 - thinking about it as if we want to train
45:53 - hundreds of thousands of teachers what's
45:55 - it going to cost and how do we bring
45:57 - those elements of cost down because how
46:00 - do we make it not be a billion-dollar
46:01 - problem and they can instead be a 400
46:03 - million dollar problem because a 400
46:05 - million dollar phone is easier to solve
46:07 - but but we add up all the elements of
46:10 - cost in doing that add to come up with
46:14 - those numbers in terms of the
46:16 - sustainability question basically our
46:18 - view is how to base e hand off add many
46:22 - of those elements of costs to the
46:23 - education system itself you know over
46:25 - the long run schools of Ed or
46:28 - traditional PD providers should be doing
46:30 - the PD and existing PD budgets should
46:33 - pay for it and nobody should be
46:36 - advocating for CS because it just is
46:37 - already there just like nobody advocates
46:39 - for biology and so that's how
46:43 - theoretically which you have
46:44 - sustainability and in the interim we're
46:47 - paying for a whole lot of it until they
46:48 - get there hey so just one last question
46:53 - um what's keeping you up at night what
46:55 - do you think is the next big challenge
46:56 - for code.org to address um
47:01 - thing keeps me up at night just because
47:03 - I'm a stress case and that's just my
47:04 - personality so if it's about one thing
47:07 - it's the next so you know the current
47:10 - things that keep me up at night and that
47:12 - have probably kept me up at night for
47:14 - all the last few years we're always
47:16 - trying to do more than we're set up to
47:19 - do because there's so much opportunity
47:21 - add you know everybody looks at the
47:24 - education system in this country and
47:26 - thanks god there's so many ways it could
47:27 - be better and most people think yeah but
47:31 - that's never going to happen except in
47:33 - this one case of what's happening in
47:35 - computer science it totally is happening
47:37 - and the system is changing and it's not
47:40 - any one organization that's changing its
47:42 - this collective of now tens of thousands
47:45 - of teachers who really care for helping
47:47 - change our school system but a code that
47:50 - over in such a unique position to help
47:53 - and facilitate that change answer every
47:56 - opportunity we have to do something good
47:58 - if we're not doing it stresses me out so
48:01 - you know the fact that we don't yet have
48:03 - a middle school course that's a full
48:05 - year middle school course and that it
48:07 - may be a year until we pilot in two
48:09 - years until we roll it out just dumb and
48:12 - we don't even have the staff to build it
48:13 - yet we need to start hiring for that
48:15 - staff and so on add all of those stress
48:17 - me out because the opportunity for our
48:19 - change is so great and we're always
48:21 - falling short of where we could be
48:24 - we want to thank you so much happy for
48:27 - being open to all these questions is
48:29 - there anything you'd like to say if we
48:30 - close out um the one thing I'd like to
48:33 - say is that ad you know this is kind of
48:38 - the vibe of what I said as well before
48:39 - you know if if you view co.org via our
48:42 - website or our programs we may look like
48:46 - this like Borg like entity that's just
48:48 - kind of solving all these problems for
48:50 - us schools we're a relatively small
48:51 - organization and we very much believe in
48:54 - trying to help find things that solve
48:56 - problem and frankly empowering educators
48:58 - to solve problems themselves if there
49:02 - are things we could do better that you
49:03 - just think hey they're doing this why
49:05 - don't they do it this other way or you
49:07 - know they need as such and such I made
49:08 - it all ready for my own classroom please
49:11 - send them to us at and we'd love to
49:14 - incorporate other people's ideas or
49:16 - creations or so on we definitely can't
49:18 - do everything ourselves and we always
49:19 - look for the community of educators to
49:22 - to help effectively do this for us and
49:26 - thank you all so much for your support
49:28 - and everything you do you know obviously
49:30 - coded or would be nowhere without the
49:32 - work of literally 150 thousand teachers
49:35 - had especially the ones who are in this
49:37 - room would obviously carry enough about
49:38 - it to come to kind of listen to this so
49:42 - thank you so much have a great evening
49:45 - so just a couple closing words before we
49:48 - sign off officially thank you so much to
49:50 - honey for taking the time thank you to
49:51 - all of you for joining us I just wanted
49:54 - to remind you that this is just the
49:56 - first in a series of meetings that we're
49:58 - planning for our teacher communities so
49:59 - we hope to see you next month in October
50:01 - where we're going to dive in deeply and
50:03 - into the results of our evaluation work
50:06 - so on that call you're going to meet Pat
50:08 - young petite is the director of
50:09 - education here at code.org as well as
50:12 - Heather King from outlier are
50:13 - independent evaluator and we're going to
50:15 - talk about some of the challenges and
50:17 - successes that code.org has encountered
50:19 - over the past year and then as i
50:22 - mentioned in november and december will
50:23 - be moving into our code conversations
50:25 - you can find a list of all of the
50:27 - upcoming hangouts and down meetings at
50:29 - code.org / educate flash events and if
50:33 - you register in advance you'll get email
50:34 - reminders as well as an email to the
50:36 - recording after the events of
50:38 - great way to just keep everything
50:39 - organized for yourself you go to the
50:41 - last slide here as howdy mentioned we
50:43 - are really committed to staying
50:45 - connected to our teacher community we've
50:47 - recently launched a twitter handle teach
50:49 - code you'll want to follow that to keep
50:51 - up to date on the latest goings-on for
50:54 - the teacher community at code.org we
50:56 - also have teacher blogs at code.org
50:57 - which is a tumblr blog that you can
50:59 - follow and then finally we've launched
51:01 - an online professional learning
51:03 - community forum for teachers which is
51:05 - located at forums at code.org if you go
51:07 - there and log in you'll find threads on
51:09 - everything from our CS fundamentals
51:11 - courses all the way up to some of the
51:13 - questions that on how you talked about
51:15 - today with them regard to the future and
51:18 - funding and things like that that's a
51:19 - great place to check in to communicate
51:21 - with us here at code.org and then also
51:23 - with your fellow teachers so thank you
51:25 - all so much for joining us this
51:27 - recording will be posted soon and we
51:29 - look forward to seeing you in October
51:31 - good night
