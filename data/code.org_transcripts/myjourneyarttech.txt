01:34 - we're going to start off with the
01:36 - question when you were in elementary
01:37 - school
01:38 - um what was your most prized stuffy or
01:42 - uh item so when i was uh my first
01:45 - birthday i actually got a little teddy
01:47 - bear that was um my favorite uh stuffed
01:50 - animal and i just called him teddy and i
01:52 - have two little boys who are seven and
01:54 - four and they have little stuffed dogs
01:56 - that they sleep with and they love so i
01:58 - just want to hear what's your most what
01:59 - was your most prized um
02:02 - uh possession at that age whether it was
02:04 - when you were in kindergarten or fourth
02:05 - or fifth grade um so let's go ahead and
02:07 - start with uh tomas and then you can
02:09 - tell us about what you do
02:12 - all right well that's an easy one uh my
02:14 - favorite uh
02:16 - stuffed animal when i was a kid was a
02:18 - rabbit named henry
02:20 - uh my grandma gave to me
02:22 - probably around the time i was six years
02:24 - old and he is still residing in my
02:27 - parents house he made it all the way
02:29 - through our childhood on many family
02:31 - trips and
02:32 - many long journeys uh every time i'm
02:34 - over there my dog does try and find him
02:38 - uh with the intention of destroying him
02:40 - but so far has been unsuccessful so
02:41 - henry continues to live
02:43 - um
02:45 - so and just introduce myself my name is
02:47 - thomas garcia
02:49 - i am the assistant vice
02:51 - president of technology and digital
02:53 - alaca which essentially means i oversee
02:55 - all of the technology and digital things
02:57 - that happen in the museum happen online
02:59 - around the museum
03:01 - um and get to work with a lot of really
03:03 - cool people like joel
03:08 - thanks thomas
03:09 - um
03:10 - so yeah my name is joel ferry and i am
03:13 - the program director of uh the
03:17 - art and technology lab at the
03:20 - la county museum of art
03:22 - and um
03:24 - let's see let me start with my my
03:26 - stuffed animal question
03:29 - so i had a stuffed animal dog um
03:33 - i left when i was really little i left
03:36 - i think i had a teddy bear
03:38 - and i was on a trip with my parents and
03:41 - we left
03:42 - the teddy bear in a motel room
03:45 - and i think i'm pretty as i remember it
03:47 - was in colorado and by the time i
03:49 - remembered
03:51 - that i forgot my stuffed animal we were
03:53 - in kansas
03:54 - and so it was kind of out of the
03:56 - question
03:57 - you know going back to get it um
04:01 - so i i got a new stuffed animal while i
04:03 - was on the road
04:05 - and it was a stuffed it was like a
04:06 - stuffed dog
04:08 - um
04:09 - and
04:10 - i named him ruff ruff
04:12 - and you know i think my sister actually
04:15 - still has ruff ruff
04:17 - uh but anyway it was like ruff ruff
04:20 - became my constant companion after that
04:23 - um
04:25 - so what do i do i run the art and
04:27 - technology lab program at lacma
04:30 - and what that is it's a grant program so
04:33 - we provide grants
04:34 - to artists
04:36 - uh that are working in technology in
04:38 - some way
04:40 - that are
04:40 - that are bringing technology into their
04:43 - artwork uh so we we help them produce
04:46 - their their work and we also give them a
04:49 - grant of up to fifty thousand dollars
04:54 - that's great thank you both so much and
04:57 - uh as a parent i know what that's like
04:59 - when you have a child losing a stuffy
05:01 - and having to go back and retrace your
05:03 - steps and yes going a whole nother state
05:05 - is usually out of the question
05:07 - um so i want to go back to tomas i want
05:09 - you to tell us a little bit more about
05:11 - the work at lacma and
05:14 - um some of the the projects you all are
05:16 - working on so if any of us happen to be
05:18 - in the los angeles area and want to
05:20 - visit what are some of the things we
05:21 - might be seeing
05:25 - absolutely um so you should be able to
05:27 - see on my screen a picture of laugh but
05:29 - it's probably the most
05:31 - recognizable picture of laughter around
05:34 - uh very popular on instagram and
05:37 - uh in in media and television shows and
05:40 - movies this is an artwork we have
05:41 - atletico called urban light um right in
05:43 - front of museums so if you if you've
05:45 - ever driven
05:46 - past these lights you've seen lacquer if
05:48 - you've ever been to these flights you've
05:49 - been to lacma um but lacma is a large
05:52 - museum in los angeles the largest uh
05:54 - encyclopedic museum on the western half
05:57 - of the united states and what that means
05:59 - is that we collect
06:00 - and exhibit a lot of different styles of
06:02 - art so while something like this is
06:04 - maybe our most famous uh we also have a
06:07 - really great collections of ancient
06:09 - american art
06:10 - uh we have uh exhibitions that come
06:13 - through about uh movies and and films
06:16 - uh we had an exhibition uh during the
06:19 - world cup around soccer
06:21 - uh we have japanese art you see samurai
06:25 - excuse me from a recent exhibition
06:27 - chinese art
06:29 - art on fashion and clothing
06:33 - this one is also a very recognizable
06:35 - piece this is the rain room uh which we
06:37 - had a few years back
06:38 - many of you may have seen that uh in
06:40 - which it rained in a room and wherever
06:42 - you were standing the rain stopped
06:45 - and then right now we're very excited to
06:47 - have the obama portrait tour in town
06:50 - many of you may recognize these images
06:52 - of uh former president barack obama
06:54 - former first lady michelle obama
06:57 - and they are at the museum right now so
06:59 - if you're in los angeles area i
07:01 - definitely recommend coming by they're
07:03 - really amazing portraits and we have a
07:05 - uh
07:06 - exhibition on you as well called black
07:08 - american portraits that showcases a wide
07:10 - variety of portraiture of black
07:12 - americans over the past uh three
07:14 - centuries so it's a really exciting
07:16 - place to work
07:18 - um it's a really you know meaningful
07:20 - museum for our community because it
07:21 - showcases a lot of different parts of
07:23 - different cultures different places and
07:26 - sort of you know helps to give the
07:28 - community more information and context
07:30 - around you know why that artwork exists
07:33 - why it's important
07:34 - um and you know why we should be uh
07:37 - considerate and aware of other cultures
07:39 - uh other artistic forms
07:42 - uh and just
07:43 - you know
07:44 - maintain a a positive and open uh
07:48 - uh mindset as as we look at art and look
07:51 - through our history
07:54 - thanks so much tomas
07:56 - so joel um given that we're talking to
07:59 - students um who are tuning in you know
08:02 - at code.org we obviously have an
08:04 - interest in technology but what i really
08:06 - like about your job is that it's the
08:08 - visual art and technology can you talk a
08:10 - little bit more about um about how that
08:13 - how that works if you're interested in
08:15 - art but you're also interested in tech
08:17 - tell us about tell us more about that
08:21 - sure so
08:23 - um we work with a wide range of artists
08:26 - we work with some artists
08:28 - that um come into our program with some
08:32 - pretty sophisticated technological
08:34 - skills
08:35 - um
08:36 - and we also work with artists that don't
08:39 - sometimes you know the artists that
08:41 - we'll work with will come in and they'll
08:43 - they'll have a sort of creative problem
08:46 - that they're looking to solve
08:48 - by producing an artwork and they know
08:50 - that they want to use technology to
08:53 - create it or to solve that problem but
08:56 - they don't know how
08:58 - but luckily we have an advisory board
09:01 - from a
09:02 - number of technology companies as well
09:05 - as from universities and independent
09:08 - artists
09:09 - who
09:10 - are able to help our grant recipients
09:13 - um
09:14 - come up with a technological solution
09:16 - um you know whether it's implementing
09:19 - uh
09:22 - robotics whether it's
09:24 - scripting
09:25 - something in uh
09:27 - java or
09:29 - python or you know one of the one of the
09:32 - many many languages
09:34 - um
09:35 - sometimes it's it's uh you know it's a
09:38 - very unexpected solution
09:41 - um
09:42 - we've we've done like very sophisticated
09:44 - 3d modeling
09:46 - of uh lacmas antipode which is the place
09:51 - on the exact opposite side of the earth
09:53 - from where you're standing
09:55 - and um we needed we're working with an
09:58 - artist to help image this or to imagine
10:00 - what lachman's antipoa looked like and
10:04 - um
10:06 - we did all this 3d modeling and what
10:08 - have you but in the end when it came to
10:10 - producing the physical sculpture of the
10:13 - anticode we ended up just hiring a
10:15 - sculptor who could work in marble and um
10:19 - you know so it was a very uh uh
10:21 - analog solution but it had a very
10:25 - sophisticated technological means of
10:27 - getting there and that's you know that's
10:30 - that's i feel like working with art and
10:32 - technology you know you're you're really
10:34 - trying to
10:36 - stay within the the marriage of those
10:38 - two and stay true to the creative
10:41 - impulse um while still you know
10:45 - leveraging all the power that that
10:48 - technology can provide you as an artist
10:52 - thank you so much joel we started
10:53 - getting a couple of um questions in the
10:55 - chat so again as a reminder to our
10:57 - teacher friends for tuning in with their
10:59 - classes feel free to put
11:01 - questions in the chat uh what your what
11:03 - grade your students are in and what the
11:05 - question is um before we get to those i
11:07 - would love to ask because we're talking
11:08 - about your work but we also know you're
11:11 - both creative individuals and have
11:13 - different passions outside of technology
11:15 - and art
11:16 - can you talk to us a little bit about
11:18 - what you like to do outside of work and
11:20 - i'll start with tomas
11:25 - sure um yeah outside of work i
11:29 - uh let's see i really
11:31 - have i'd say
11:33 - three main passions uh one of them is is
11:36 - just creating things and tinkering
11:38 - things and learning new things
11:40 - um recently i've uh been working on i
11:44 - learned how to program uh some video
11:47 - games and here's a simple
11:49 - video game project i was working on in
11:51 - which uh santa claus is uh trying to
11:54 - compete with a reindeer to collect the
11:57 - most cookies
11:58 - which ties in one of my other big
12:00 - passions which is christmas i really
12:02 - like christmas
12:03 - um
12:04 - another project i worked in on recently
12:06 - is digital rendering
12:08 - this is a digital rendering i made
12:10 - recently of
12:11 - a space with neon sign and my dad in it
12:15 - uh and which ties in one of my other
12:17 - passions which is neon
12:19 - this is a neon sign i made recently
12:22 - of an astronaut obviously
12:24 - uh and if you look closely you can see
12:26 - his visor is sort of mirrored so that
12:28 - when you look at the sign you see
12:29 - yourself in the face mask to remind
12:32 - yourself that you know anything you
12:33 - really want to do you can achieve if you
12:36 - put in uh the effort and then last but
12:39 - not least which i may have mentioned
12:40 - already is
12:42 - is my dog is definitely a big uh
12:45 - uh
12:46 - passion of mine in my free time we do a
12:48 - lot of things together so
12:50 - you know i think i think uh
12:52 - a mixture of of digital and non-digital
12:56 - and uh uh
12:58 - uh al all sorts of all over the map when
13:01 - it comes to my personal life but uh
13:03 - those are definitely
13:04 - things that keep me busy when i'm not at
13:06 - work
13:07 - that's great thanks so much tamask
13:09 - um and i'll ask you to stop screen
13:11 - sharing because i want to see maybe joel
13:13 - has some some interesting things to show
13:15 - us so joel what do you do
13:17 - um outside of work and you know what
13:19 - kind of projects are you working on
13:22 - um for me i i there's kind of two other
13:26 - things in my life
13:27 - one is i like to try
13:30 - i like to go hiking or or biking
13:34 - out in the wilderness um
13:36 - i like to try and find a place
13:39 - on the map that is like one of the most
13:41 - far away
13:43 - uh remote locations that is like you
13:46 - know within a day's worth of driving
13:48 - distance
13:50 - and then i i i typically will go there
13:52 - and i'll spend the night there
13:54 - um and just really kind of
13:57 - enjoy the peace and quiet the solitude
14:01 - um the landscape
14:03 - and
14:04 - um the you know and also you know just
14:07 - the the temporary disconnect from uh
14:11 - the internet and from technology it's
14:14 - it's just a nice way to kind of clear
14:16 - your head
14:17 - and um you know recharge your your
14:20 - batteries
14:21 - so um
14:23 - that i think is is one of my favorite
14:25 - things and i'll spend you know count
14:27 - right before doing this i'll spend
14:29 - countless hours
14:30 - studying the map and trying to figure
14:32 - out what the you know the lay of the
14:34 - land and how to get there and everything
14:37 - um how much water you have to bring how
14:40 - much food you have to bring all that
14:42 - planning is is part of the fun
14:45 - so um
14:46 - that you know that's a that's a passion
14:49 - and then i guess my other passion is um
14:52 - [Music]
14:53 - buying old bicycles taking them apart
14:56 - and then
14:57 - rebuilding them so
14:59 - i think i can my computer will will stay
15:02 - awake um i could show you my workshop
15:05 - which is actually right next to my
15:06 - office so yes please we would love to
15:09 - see that we would love to see your
15:10 - workshop
15:11 - okay hang on one sec
15:17 - this is so fun i can't wait
15:22 - [Music]
15:28 - i'm gonna get like an impromptu tour
15:33 - this is the garage
15:37 - let's see if my cat's awake
15:42 - my cat lives in the garage
15:48 - all right so
15:50 - well it's dark is it spooky oh that's so
15:53 - fun
15:54 - so you can kind of see this here yeah so
15:56 - this is my current project
15:58 - um this is an old mountain bike that i
16:01 - kind of hacked apart and
16:03 - um
16:04 - took some some different bike parts and
16:07 - put on it kind of like that you know
16:10 - i go i have a big bin of parts of random
16:13 - bike parts that i keep over here
16:17 - but
16:19 - i actually just sorted it out it doesn't
16:21 - look very tidy but actually that's very
16:24 - organized for me
16:25 - um
16:26 - but generally i like to
16:30 - take them apart i'll spend hours just
16:32 - trying new solutions
16:34 - to see if i can get certain bike parts
16:37 - to work that normally shouldn't work
16:38 - together
16:40 - and um
16:41 - when it does work it's really gratifying
16:43 - because you can end up with like a
16:44 - really cool bike that you know no one
16:46 - else has
16:48 - so and that's kind of also building
16:50 - bikes it's so much learning by doing and
16:53 - trial and error that
16:54 - it's you know when you get to a point
16:56 - where you have a really cool bike it's a
16:58 - lot of fun
16:59 - and then you can
17:01 - put some bags on it and go ride out into
17:03 - the wilderness so
17:05 - wow that is so cool thank you for
17:07 - sharing your workshop and
17:09 - um your passion both of you
17:11 - so in the in the 10 minutes we have left
17:13 - i really want to hear from our students
17:16 - and one of the questions here is from
17:19 - um i don't know if this is chamber's
17:20 - last name or the teacher's name but a
17:22 - fifth grade class the fifth grade class
17:24 - is asking um which has been your most
17:27 - difficult piece to create
17:29 - so i will leave it up to you to answer
17:32 - do you what's what's been the most
17:33 - difficult thing that you yourself have
17:35 - created or
17:37 - what has been one of the most difficult
17:39 - pieces that lacma artists have created
17:41 - maybe something that's kind of way out
17:43 - there and just a very time consuming or
17:45 - tough so i'll let each of you choose
17:47 - which one to answer but um let's start
17:49 - with tomas
17:52 - sure um we've we've got a lot of
17:55 - difficult projects let's see
17:57 - i'll i'll start with um some exciting
17:59 - ones that i think are relevant to
18:01 - conversation today
18:05 - we recently did a partnership with
18:07 - snapchat which is
18:08 - an app many of you may know and use in
18:10 - which we created augmented reality uh
18:13 - monuments around los angeles and so uh
18:16 - you can see here this is sort of what it
18:17 - looked like if you're at the park
18:19 - and then and through your phone screen
18:21 - you would see all these different um
18:23 - augmented reality pieces that the artist
18:25 - reuben ochoa came up with to display in
18:28 - the park and this is macarthur park in
18:29 - downtown los angeles uh as a
18:32 - honor to uh uh the the people who uh
18:36 - sell food
18:37 - um in stands in the park uh uh
18:40 - vendors and and um so it was a really
18:43 - cool project but really you know on the
18:45 - cutting edge of technology uh at the
18:47 - same time we did one um that showcased
18:50 - the story of ada pinkston
18:52 - um
18:53 - an african-american woman from uh uh
18:56 - early la history who who was a
18:59 - significant landowner and a significant
19:00 - role in uh los angeles history who had
19:03 - been sort of forgotten from some of the
19:05 - uh
19:06 - la histories and we really wanted to
19:08 - showcase her story and uh there's audio
19:11 - playing of her voice and when you go to
19:12 - the park you can experience her through
19:14 - an augmented reality experience
19:17 - um so those are really difficult there's
19:19 - a lot of other difficult projects that
19:20 - have happened but
19:22 - these ones are really cool because they
19:23 - sort of sort of told stories that you
19:24 - might not otherwise think of when you
19:26 - think of monuments
19:28 - um so it was really exciting project but
19:30 - i know joel has a lot of
19:32 - crazy and difficult projects i
19:34 - definitely want to leave some time for
19:36 - him to share those
19:40 - sure thanks tomas yeah that that
19:43 - snapchat collaboration was super cool
19:46 - and i think that the ada pinkson one is
19:48 - one of my favorites of that series that
19:50 - y'all did so
19:52 - very cool um
19:54 - for the art and tech program you know we
19:57 - we really try and work with the artists
19:59 - to realize what their vision is
20:02 - and that vision
20:04 - it's constantly changing and so we
20:07 - worked with an artist named tavares
20:09 - strzok who came into our program
20:12 - and he was really interested in
20:14 - launching
20:15 - um these small sort of glass model
20:18 - rockets
20:19 - um kind of like what you'd get in a
20:21 - hobby store or something
20:23 - but they're really beautiful he was me
20:25 - he was making them out of glass and he
20:27 - was making the glass from uh he's from
20:30 - the bahamas and so he made
20:33 - the glass out of sand that came from the
20:35 - bahamas or these beautiful little model
20:38 - rockets that he was launching
20:40 - and
20:41 - in our program he he we introduced him
20:44 - to the
20:46 - one of the
20:47 - directors of spacex
20:49 - um the rocket company
20:52 - and
20:53 - they got into a conversation and before
20:56 - we knew it
20:57 - we were going to be launching a
20:58 - satellite into space um a satellite that
21:01 - contained an artwork
21:03 - and all of a sudden
21:05 - you know i was at one point just
21:07 - thinking okay yeah we'll you know maybe
21:08 - launch some model rockets and um you
21:11 - know try and see if we can have an
21:13 - exhibition or something and
21:14 - well and now at this point we're we're
21:17 - actually trying to figure out how to get
21:19 - an artwork into space
21:21 - so that was a very steep learning curve
21:24 - um but
21:25 - we did uh
21:27 - we were able to i mean there was a lot
21:30 - of many many many many conversations
21:32 - that we had to have it was a lot of work
21:34 - it took us five years
21:36 - to do this just just to make the
21:39 - satellite
21:40 - um to meet all the requirements um
21:44 - for an artwork to be in space there's
21:47 - certain materials you have to use
21:49 - there's certain testing you have to go
21:51 - through
21:52 - um
21:53 - you have to talk to all these different
21:55 - government agencies and
21:57 - you know confirm with them that what
21:59 - you're doing isn't going to hurt
22:01 - everything else that's floating around
22:02 - in space
22:04 - but um actually it's
22:06 - it's going to be in
22:09 - i think our three-year anniversary of
22:11 - launching uh our enoch sculpture and
22:14 - that's the name of the artwork
22:16 - um our three-year anniversary is coming
22:18 - up in this early december
22:21 - so in this satellite that we launched
22:24 - it's about the size of a shoe box and
22:27 - it's orbiting earth like as we speak and
22:29 - i can go online and anyone can go online
22:32 - and if you google like um
22:34 - a uh
22:36 - satellite tracker if you just google
22:37 - like satellite tracker and then you type
22:39 - in
22:40 - lacma enoch you'll
22:42 - our satellite will show up and it will
22:44 - tell you where it is uh you know over
22:47 - the earth at this current moment so
22:49 - that's a really gratifying project that
22:52 - was really fraught with uh pitfalls
22:55 - but we were able to push through and
22:57 - realize it
22:58 - so
22:59 - that is so cool kids make sure you ask
23:02 - your teachers at some point maybe um
23:04 - after the thanksgiving holidays to
23:07 - please show you um the satellite tracker
23:09 - that is such a fun
23:11 - um an interesting thing i didn't even
23:13 - know that existed so it could be a
23:15 - lesson plan out of that probably
23:17 - um there was a question in here asking
23:19 - from miss woodward's class in
23:21 - connecticut the students would like to
23:23 - know where alexis is are you sitting in
23:24 - a museum i am not i was mentioning at
23:27 - the start i know some folks jumped on
23:29 - late i am actually at the most magical
23:31 - place on earth i am at walt disney world
23:34 - right now and i am sitting in a
23:37 - hotel
23:38 - kind of lobby area and i'll just show
23:41 - you really quick and it's obviously the
23:42 - holiday so they're decorating it with
23:44 - christmas trees and
23:46 - um yeah it's a fun little space so
23:49 - that's where i'm at um and thanks for
23:50 - asking
23:52 - so
23:53 - let's see the next question
23:55 - there are a lot of them here
24:03 - so uh victoria is actually um at home
24:06 - and victoria would like to know what was
24:08 - your favorite subject when you were a
24:11 - kid
24:12 - joel let's start with you
24:17 - all right that's a good question um
24:20 - all right i'm in a minute my favorite
24:22 - subject actually i mean well this is
24:24 - kind of obvious now but it was art
24:27 - but i wasn't
24:29 - an artist um
24:31 - that was you know the tricky thing is
24:33 - that i i may have had like a lot of
24:35 - creative ideas but
24:37 - i couldn't draw i couldn't i wasn't very
24:40 - good with sculpture and and
24:42 - when i was in lower school i really
24:44 - struggled with with art class just i
24:47 - mean i could do things that involved
24:49 - like collages and stuff like that but i
24:51 - just i just didn't my hands weren't good
24:53 - enough for me to draw
24:55 - um and so that kind of held me back for
24:58 - a long time
25:00 - until middle school when i took my first
25:02 - photography class and i got my hands on
25:04 - a camera
25:05 - and
25:06 - i guess that was the first time that i
25:08 - really started i realized that you know
25:11 - it when you start working with
25:13 - technology it can really help people who
25:15 - are creative who may not
25:16 - be able to come up with a sort of analog
25:19 - solution or you know a pencil and paper
25:21 - kind of solution but maybe
25:24 - work doing something on a computer can
25:25 - really help
25:27 - and i was one of those kids that you
25:29 - know technology really helped them
25:33 - find a way to ex express themselves um
25:38 - and so yeah that was sort of my earlier
25:41 - interests
25:44 - thanks joel
25:45 - what did you enjoy studying in what was
25:47 - your favorite subject
25:51 - you may have been able to tell from my
25:53 - uh
25:54 - response on the snapchat augmented
25:56 - reality project but history was my
25:58 - favorite i really love you know looking
26:00 - back in time and finding interesting
26:02 - stories all of the interesting people
26:04 - that have come before us
26:05 - understanding how we got you know to the
26:08 - world that we live in today and really
26:10 - just appreciating you know
26:13 - the that all of the things that we've
26:15 - accomplished um you know all the things
26:17 - that uh we can learn from
26:20 - and and and just you know look through
26:22 - that uh deep through history and try to
26:24 - apply those things to our lives
26:26 - um at the time i you know i wasn't keen
26:29 - on uh subjects like math uh because i
26:32 - didn't understand how they applied but
26:34 - as i got older and realized you know
26:36 - that like math is everywhere and
26:37 - everything we do like has some element
26:39 - of math in it uh even like joel was
26:42 - saying with planning a camping trip
26:44 - uh i also really started to appreciate
26:46 - math just because it was something that
26:48 - you know once you sort of understood it
26:49 - you could use it every day and it wasn't
26:52 - always you know something you'd have to
26:54 - write out on a chalkboard or a piece of
26:56 - paper you could really just you know
26:57 - think about it in your head and it'd
26:59 - help you get through your days so those
27:01 - are probably my top two
27:04 - thanks so much um we are almost out of
27:07 - time here but there was a question again
