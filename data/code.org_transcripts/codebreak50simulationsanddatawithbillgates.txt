01:25 - all right i'm taking us off of mute so
01:27 - people can hear us
01:29 - they can hear you now
01:30 - yes we're no longer on youtube have one
01:33 - more minute before we start because
01:34 - people are going to start joining in
01:40 - are you ready sofia
01:42 - don't get nervous
01:54 - so
01:59 - the hannah
02:01 - you can slightly here
02:06 - all right we're waiting a few more
02:08 - seconds because people are joining the
02:09 - zoom call really really quickly
02:14 - we're almost ready to start
02:28 - all right it's 10 a.m almost ready
02:31 - don't forget to smile
02:40 - um
03:05 - hi welcome to code break and happy earth
03:07 - day my name is hadi there are tens of
03:10 - thousands of people joining us across
03:11 - zoom on facebook live and on youtube
03:14 - live together we're hoping to build the
03:16 - world's largest live interactive
03:18 - classroom
03:19 - with so many students at home my team at
03:21 - code.org invites families everywhere to
03:23 - join us for a weekly dose of inspiration
03:25 - community and computer science
03:28 - this is my daughter and sidekick sophia
03:30 - hello
03:31 - she's a budding computer scientist
03:33 - for those families who've been enjoying
03:35 - code break i want to take a moment to
03:36 - thank you for joining us every week and
03:38 - also to ask you to consider supporting
03:40 - us at code.org our goal is to give every
03:43 - student in every school the opportunity
03:45 - to learn computer
03:46 - science and every dollar you can give
03:48 - code.org will support one student to
03:49 - learn
03:50 - our team created the hour of code which
03:52 - has engaged so many students and we're
03:54 - just a few days away from celebrating
03:56 - one billion hours of
03:58 - done by students but we need your help
04:00 - to keep education free for all students
04:02 - so to support us
04:04 - please considering going to code.org and
04:06 - click the button that says help us or
04:08 - you can visit code.org help
04:11 - whether you choose to donate money or
04:13 - you can buy one of these super cool hats
04:16 - together you can help our cause
04:18 - please spread the word and invite others
04:19 - to join code break the larger our
04:21 - audience the better the special guests
04:23 - will have to join us and today we have a
04:25 - very very special guest bill gates
04:28 - who'll be joining us in a little bit
04:30 - but first let's get a chance to meet our
04:32 - live audience we have dozens of students
04:34 - on camera can everybody wave we're going
04:36 - to unmute you and everybody say hello
04:38 - all at the same time
04:46 - [Music]
04:54 - and i want to get a chance to meet the
04:55 - rest of our audience to find out where
04:58 - everybody is from we use a geographic
04:59 - poll
05:00 - so i'm going to switch to screen share
05:04 - to show where all these students are
05:05 - calling from
05:08 - look at all the countries of the world
05:09 - that folks are calling from so there's a
05:11 - whole bunch of people in the united
05:13 - states you can see
05:15 - uh but
05:17 - yeah and also from canada there's people
05:19 - from
05:19 - hawaii there's people from africa
05:23 - there's people a lot of people from
05:25 - india oh my gosh from south korea from
05:27 - japan so these folks are calling it it's
05:29 - it's live but it's for some folks at 7am
05:32 - or 6am for some folks it's after
05:34 - midnight uh people are calling from
05:36 - really all hours to see this live
05:39 - show you can also of course watch the
05:41 - recordings after the fact if you miss it
05:43 - so those of you who are in japan or
05:44 - china uh it's great to have you join us
05:47 - live but if there's families who miss
05:49 - this they can also watch it on youtube
05:50 - afterwards i also want to get a sense of
05:53 - the difference age levels grade levels
05:55 - and experience levels so could we do a
05:56 - quick audience poll to get a sense of
05:58 - what grade the students joining us are
06:01 - in
06:02 - so if you're on zoom you can answer this
06:04 - poll and submit it those of you who are
06:06 - watching us on youtube or on facebook
06:08 - live will share the results of the poll
06:11 - relatively soon
06:14 - and we're collecting answers from
06:17 - thousands of folks let's put the answers
06:19 - up on the screen
06:20 - all right so we can see the biggest
06:22 - group of folks are in middle school and
06:23 - in late elementary school but they're
06:25 - students ranging everywhere from k-12
06:28 - and a whole bunch of adults as well
06:30 - let's also get a sense of the experience
06:32 - level of folks so we're going to put up
06:34 - another poll asking you
06:36 - what your computer science experiences
06:38 - now we've prepared code break for
06:40 - students who are beginners just getting
06:43 - started or intermediate or even advanced
06:46 - we're going to try in one hour to go
06:47 - through all levels of computer science
06:49 - uh which is not an easy thing to do in
06:51 - one hour
06:54 - all right if we could put the results on
06:55 - screen
06:56 - you can see the majority of folks are
06:58 - intermediates and a lot of beginners a
07:00 - few advanced folks as well if you're
07:02 - advanced please be patient with us we're
07:04 - gonna get to more advanced stuff by the
07:06 - end of the hour and if you're a beginner
07:07 - and things move too quickly for you it's
07:09 - okay you won't necessarily need to learn
07:11 - every single thing we talk about but
07:13 - you'll still learn some stuff that's
07:14 - cool
07:16 - now when bill gates joins us i want to
07:19 - make sure to give everybody a chance to
07:20 - ask bill a question he's a few minutes
07:22 - away but you have time now to think of
07:24 - your questions in advance and i'm going
07:26 - to tell you how to ask your questions
07:27 - when bill joins so listen carefully
07:29 - because i'm not going to repeat this on
07:31 - the fly if you're on zoom you can use
07:34 - the q a button which looks like this
07:39 - and if you're on a touch screen you may
07:40 - need to tap the screen to look at it if
07:42 - you're on facebook live you can use the
07:44 - comments in the live stream
07:46 - and if you're on uh youtube live the
07:48 - comments have been disabled but you can
07:50 - always use twitter if you post to
07:52 - twitter using the hashtag codebreak
07:54 - like this hashtag codebreak
07:57 - we'll pull the best questions to ask
07:58 - from bill gates
08:00 - now today's episode has multiple parts
08:03 - we're going to talk about simulation and
08:05 - data
08:07 - first we're going to talk about
08:09 - simulating a disease
08:11 - next we're going to do a q a with bill
08:13 - gates
08:14 - then third then we're going to talk
08:15 - about estimating the spread of the
08:16 - disease and then finally about
08:18 - visualizing data and all of this of
08:20 - course in the context of the cronovirus
08:22 - pandemic that's going on through the
08:24 - world
08:25 - as we go through this we may run into
08:26 - few bugs and if we do run into glitches
08:29 - we're going to learn a computer science
08:30 - concept called debugging
08:32 - this is sophia's little bug
08:34 - she drew it herself and debugging is
08:36 - what we do when we try to run into
08:38 - problems problems happen all the time
08:40 - with computer science and it's not a
08:42 - question whether you run into problems
08:43 - it's how you debug them
08:45 - now before we start today's lesson we
08:47 - want to welcome some students to demo
08:48 - their creations
08:50 - last week's challenge was to make your
08:51 - own pixel art or to improve our image
08:53 - doodler each week when students join
08:56 - code break we we ask you to send the
08:57 - things you create as the challenges for
08:59 - the next week and then we'll invite some
09:01 - folks to join us for next week's episode
09:04 - uh so i'm going to screen share but can
09:05 - we first invite daniel and sophia who
09:08 - who sent us stuff from last week hi
09:11 - are you guys up there say hi
09:13 - hi
09:15 - hi there where are you calling us from
09:17 - austin texas
09:19 - austin texas wow that's a you're like in
09:21 - the middle of a flower field aren't you
09:24 - yeah
09:26 - that's a very cute background so i'm
09:28 - gonna screen share what you two created
09:30 - uh and why don't you tell us a little
09:32 - bit about what this is so you use the
09:33 - pixel
09:35 - yeah
09:36 - pixel emojis which one have you made
09:38 - which one
09:39 - [Music]
09:40 - so
09:41 - i made the red heart
09:43 - and my sister made the other one i made
09:46 - the red part with the black
09:48 - outline and then daniel made the one
09:51 - with
09:52 - a red heart but with a green outline
09:55 - all right and so you see ones and zeros
09:58 - so you guys didn't actually color the
09:59 - dots in you made all these little tiny
10:01 - little ones and zeros over here to make
10:03 - the r to yourself
10:06 - was it a lot did it take a lot of time
10:08 - to make this
10:13 - oh i think we lost them in their cool
10:15 - background well
10:18 - i can't hear them so bye-bye to daniel
10:20 - and sophia
10:21 - the other thing i want to share is this
10:23 - this pixel art that was created by ish
10:25 - john ishan is a six-year-old boy
10:27 - studying uh in bangalore india and he's
10:29 - been with code break for the entire time
10:32 - we've been doing it
10:33 - and he sent this in and again this is
10:35 - pixel rt created using ones and zeros
10:37 - and he said he wrote sentences and said
10:39 - i love the pixelation it is so so cool i
10:42 - use three-bit code to make the code sign
10:45 - i first drew it on my math book and then
10:47 - i coded it on the workspace using ones
10:48 - and zeros and i chose the aqua color
10:51 - with the zero one one code because it's
10:53 - thecolorofcode.org
10:54 - i loved it thank you thank you so much
10:56 - ishaan as well
10:58 - so we're to start today's lesson and
11:00 - we're going to start learning about
11:01 - simulation
11:03 - our word for today is simulation
11:06 - simulation is something that scientists
11:07 - and computer scientists use to run
11:10 - science experiments usually when you
11:13 - make science experiments you do it in a
11:15 - lab like in chemistry when you mix a
11:16 - bunch of chemicals together to see what
11:18 - happens or you can do something with
11:20 - live animals but there's a lot of things
11:22 - you can't do in a lab and that's why you
11:24 - use simulation to make an experiment
11:27 - that simulates the real thing that
11:29 - happens rather than having it happen in
11:31 - real time so for example if we want to
11:33 - simulate how a disease spreads you don't
11:36 - want to actually spread a disease among
11:38 - real humans you want to simulate it to
11:40 - see what could happen now sophia is
11:42 - going to join me to code this uh and i'm
11:45 - going to share my screen to show you
11:47 - what we're going to be creating
11:49 - so just one second
11:53 - so i'm going to first show you the
11:54 - finished product of what we're going to
11:56 - create is going to be a simulation that
11:58 - shows a bunch of sprites or little
12:00 - monsters
12:03 - you're going to see these there's going
12:04 - to be one that is going to be red the
12:06 - red one is infected
12:08 - with a disease and if anybody any of
12:10 - these sprites that's red touches one of
12:12 - the blue sprites they spread the
12:14 - infection and you can see gradually the
12:16 - whole community is getting that
12:18 - infection
12:19 - we're going to see we're going to create
12:20 - the simulation in code and sophia is
12:22 - going to be doing the coding here we are
12:24 - in code.org in our tool called sprite
12:26 - lab this over here is where you're going
12:28 - to see the simulation
12:30 - this here are the different commands you
12:31 - can use
12:32 - and our code itself is going to be over
12:34 - here and i'm going to hand the mouse to
12:36 - sofia to do this
12:37 - so sophia the first thing you want to do
12:39 - is create a background so go into the
12:41 - world menu and set a background
12:44 - and make it be a k because our sprites
12:47 - live in a cave now what we want to do is
12:49 - we want to create
12:50 - 10 different sprites so go into the
12:52 - sprite menu
12:53 - and club make new sprite
12:57 - um but instead of having one of these we
12:59 - want 10 of them so i'm going to loops
13:01 - and repeat 10 times
13:03 - so we're going to make 10 sprites
13:06 - and now these are all at the middle of
13:08 - the screen so we want to change the
13:09 - location so if you could take that
13:10 - little block out
13:12 - and go to the
13:14 - sprite menu and choose random location
13:16 - so there's going to be 10 sprites at
13:17 - random locations are perfect now these
13:20 - are too big so if you could make them
13:21 - smaller or go into the
13:24 - action menu and set their spot size to
13:26 - 50.
13:27 - all right perfect
13:29 - right so now we have our 10 sprites and
13:31 - these are the healthy sprites but we
13:32 - want one that is infected with the
13:34 - disease so make a new sprite go into the
13:36 - sprite menu
13:38 - into the sprite menu
13:40 - and make a new sprite
13:43 - and choose a different costume for this
13:46 - make the red one
13:47 - now i want to show something by the way
13:49 - you can change the costumes if i go into
13:51 - the costume tab you can choose different
13:53 - looks and feels for these sprites and
13:55 - you can actually edit them yourselves
13:57 - we've already created some to use in
13:59 - this tool right now so for this red
14:01 - sprite we also want to make this one uh
14:03 - small as well so go into the action menu
14:06 - and set its size to 50 as well
14:11 - so we're going to make the red side
14:12 - sprite size 50 great
14:15 - so this is how our world is going to
14:17 - start but we want to have all these
14:18 - spots moving around so go into action
14:21 - and have the sprites begin wandering
14:23 - so have that wandering block that's
14:25 - going to make all of the blue sprites
14:27 - wander and you want to make the red
14:28 - sprite wander as well
14:35 - all right now if you hit run what's
14:36 - going to happen
14:37 - they're going to want they're all going
14:38 - to wander
14:40 - but right now nothing's the infection
14:42 - isn't passing around but we want to
14:43 - write codes that every time the red
14:45 - sprite touches one of the blue sprites
14:46 - it passes on the infection so hit reset
14:49 - and now we want to use events go into
14:51 - the event area and and save so that when
14:54 - a red sprite touches a blue sprite
14:59 - or sorry when a blue sprite touches the
15:00 - red sprite
15:03 - so first thing you want to do is have it
15:04 - bounce off so have it have an action to
15:06 - make it bounce off
15:10 - and then have another action to have the
15:12 - blue sprite change costume to become red
15:15 - because basically he's getting the
15:17 - disease
15:18 - and it becomes red
15:20 - all right now hit run and see what
15:22 - happens
15:22 - as soon as a blue sprite touches the red
15:24 - sprites wait all of them turn red oh
15:27 - that's because we made all of the blue
15:29 - sprites turn red
15:30 - hit reset
15:32 - and see where it says change the blue
15:33 - sprites to red you want to get rid of
15:35 - that and instead you want this sprite to
15:37 - turn red so
15:39 - yeah so that way only this sprite that
15:41 - touch the red sprite turns red
15:44 - right
15:45 - so now we can see as soon as any of
15:47 - these sprites touches the red sprite the
15:48 - disease is spreading and this now we
15:51 - made a simulation of how disease can
15:52 - spread but that's not all we can
15:55 - simulate more stuff let's simulate what
15:57 - would happen if we want to try to
15:58 - prevent the spread of the disease so
16:00 - what i want to do is introduce the idea
16:02 - of a green sprite that doesn't get the
16:04 - disease and when you click a sprite you
16:06 - make it green so uh so can you add an
16:10 - event so when you click
16:12 - on a blue sprite
16:15 - when you click on a blue sprite change
16:16 - its color to be green
16:19 - go to action
16:20 - to change its costume
16:22 - to be green
16:25 - right now i run this to see how it goes
16:27 - and then click on
16:28 - this oh wait oh all of them turn green
16:30 - stop it again
16:32 - instead of the blue turning instead of
16:33 - making all of the blue ones turn green
16:35 - again we want to make the just this
16:37 - sprite that you
16:38 - turn green
16:40 - all right so now
16:42 - anytime we click on a blue sprite it's
16:44 - green
16:45 - and because it's green the other event
16:47 - won't happen so it's protected from
16:49 - getting the disease
16:51 - this protection is like a vaccine it
16:53 - stays on and protects the sprite so it
16:56 - can't get that disease but we can also
16:58 - use a different kind of simulation and
17:00 - simulate as if it's washing their hands
17:02 - so hit reset we want to make it so that
17:04 - if you're green if clicking a sprite to
17:07 - make it green is like washing your hands
17:08 - it doesn't stay washed you can actually
17:11 - make it so that if the green sprites
17:12 - it's got its hands clean but if it
17:14 - reaches a red stripe again it's no
17:16 - longer clean you can't wash your hands
17:18 - today and then keep it clean yeah
17:20 - they're not clean forever so make it so
17:22 - that when one of the green sprites touch
17:24 - a red sprite
17:27 - when a green sprite
17:32 - the red one
17:33 - it has its hands clean but when it
17:35 - touches somebody with the infection it
17:37 - bounces off again
17:44 - and then also you want to change its
17:45 - costume now to become
17:47 - blue so it's back to normal it's not
17:49 - sick
17:50 - change that to this sprite
17:54 - so now when a green sprite touches the
17:56 - red sprites
17:57 - when you when you click a sprite they
17:59 - wash their hands
18:01 - and when you click you wash your hands
18:02 - they're protected briefly but if they
18:05 - touch an infected sprite again
18:07 - they need to become green again you need
18:09 - to continuously wash the hands of these
18:11 - spikes to protect them click click
18:13 - protect them see if as soon as a blue
18:15 - sprite touches the sprite with the virus
18:18 - you need to click it again so it washes
18:19 - its hands again and so this is
18:22 - a simulation of how the virus is trying
18:24 - to spread and if you don't wash hands
18:26 - quickly enough everybody gets this
18:28 - infection all right so this is kind of a
18:31 - interesting way to show a simulation and
18:34 - you know this looks a little bit more
18:35 - like a game real science uses a much
18:37 - larger simulation
18:40 - but this is something that we just
18:41 - created in just five minutes uh and we
18:43 - can share this out to you i'm gonna
18:46 - click the share button
18:47 - to share this out
18:49 - uh and you see this qr code
18:51 - and i'm gonna make this a little bit
18:53 - larger
18:54 - if you have a phone you can actually
18:55 - scan that qr code by opening your
18:58 - phone's camera
18:59 - and if you do that you're gonna actually
19:01 - get a little pop-up on your browser that
19:02 - actually sends you a url to the code
19:04 - that sofia just made
19:06 - and you can actually play that
19:08 - simulation on your phone right now
19:11 - and don't worry if you don't have a
19:12 - phone if you're actually watching this
19:14 - on your phone if you sign up for code
19:16 - break we're going to email this to you
19:17 - afterwards now not only can you play the
19:20 - simulation that we just created we're
19:22 - going to challenge you to improve on it
19:24 - you know what we created simulates
19:26 - washing of your hands but as we know to
19:28 - stop the spread of the vaccine stop the
19:30 - spread of the disease something else all
19:32 - of us have been doing a social
19:33 - distancing and staying away from each
19:35 - other so one of our challenges is going
19:37 - to be what if you could make some walls
19:40 - to prevent the sprites from running into
19:42 - each other so they could sort of get
19:43 - back and forth between the walls but
19:45 - they don't run into each other quite as
19:47 - often that's going to simulate what
19:49 - social distancing does or you can
19:51 - simulate what it's like to have a
19:53 - vaccine
19:54 - all of these simulations are basically
19:56 - things you can add to the code yourself
19:59 - and let me stop my screen share so
20:02 - if you
20:04 - um
20:06 - so
20:07 - one thing i want to do uh last is show
20:09 - by the way another very simple thing you
20:11 - could do in the simulation is you can
20:13 - see for example what would happen if we
20:15 - had more sprites to begin so if we had
20:17 - 20 sprites at the beginning
20:19 - look how quickly the disease spreads and
20:22 - how hard it is to wash your hands
20:24 - so this is just an interesting
20:26 - simulation you can do to see basically
20:28 - what the spread of a disease looks like
20:30 - now what i want to
20:32 - do um
20:34 - all right we're done with talking about
20:36 - our simulation now we're ready for the
20:37 - next part of today's lesson which is our
20:40 - q a
20:41 - with bill gates
20:43 - our special guest is joining very very
20:45 - soon
20:46 - now
20:47 - i can't wait to join bill gates to join
20:49 - us i first met bill when i was working
20:51 - at microsoft years ago when i was a
20:53 - college student actually and i was
20:55 - amazed by how much effort bill put into
20:57 - learning everything about everything
21:00 - this is a man who was reading multiple
21:01 - books a day
21:03 - every day and at code.org we are so
21:05 - fortunate to consider bill among the
21:07 - very very first supporters of the work
21:08 - that we do
21:09 - bill are you here with us yet
21:11 - i am do you hear me
21:13 - yep we can hear you how are you doing
21:16 - uh you know it's a crazy time uh very
21:19 - different but uh
21:21 - you know i'm safe and with my family and
21:24 - you know trying to help out with all the
21:26 - drugs and vaccines we're gonna need to
21:27 - get out of this situation
21:30 - yeah
21:31 - so bill today's code break is about
21:32 - simulation and data and we're going to
21:34 - talk about how we use modeling and
21:35 - simulation to stop diseases we're joined
21:38 - by tens of thousands of students either
21:40 - on this live zoom call or on youtube or
21:42 - on facebook and they're ranging from
21:44 - kindergarten through high school they're
21:46 - joining us live from as far west as
21:48 - hawaii and as far east as japan so it's
21:51 - anywhere from six a.m to after midnight
21:53 - their time
21:55 - but first i want to introduce my
21:56 - daughter and coding sidekick sophia
21:58 - hello
21:59 - she's an avid computer scientist and
22:01 - she's going to start us off with the
22:02 - computer science joke of the day
22:05 - okay
22:06 - hi mr gates or am i allowed to call you
22:08 - bill
22:10 - sure
22:11 - all right okay
22:12 - bill why did the java programmer need
22:14 - eye glasses
22:19 - he couldn't see shark
22:23 - that's a good one
22:24 - and if people didn't get the joke c
22:26 - sharp is a microsoft programming
22:28 - language all right so bill i have a
22:30 - first question is this with one billion
22:32 - students at home with school closed and
22:35 - teachers or parents are struggling to
22:36 - make sure learning keeps going
22:38 - everybody's having trouble focusing what
22:40 - do you do personally to make sure you
22:42 - spend this time productively instead of
22:44 - just watching tv or playing on an xbox
22:46 - or
22:47 - what do you what are you doing with your
22:49 - time are you reading
22:50 - how do you stay focused
22:53 - of course we're all on
22:55 - different schedules and
22:58 - you know we're
22:59 - often squeezed into less space you know
23:02 - all trying to get things done than
23:04 - before i do think that having a normal
23:06 - pattern
23:08 - a new normal pattern of okay what time
23:10 - am i gonna
23:11 - really focus on my schoolwork
23:14 - what breaks am i gonna take in that and
23:16 - trying every day to stick to that you
23:18 - know it's pretty helpful then you can
23:20 - figure out uh you know who has the
23:22 - machine and when people need to be quiet
23:24 - in the room that you're trying to do the
23:25 - work in
23:26 - uh you know it is amazing there's you
23:29 - know you guys are putting out great
23:31 - resources
23:32 - uh
23:33 - khan academy is putting out great
23:35 - resources so people are rising to the
23:37 - occasion
23:38 - uh you know sadly some schools
23:41 - uh aren't as equipped uh as others and
23:45 - you know teachers are having to learn
23:46 - new things but i do think the discipline
23:49 - uh is pretty important i'm
23:52 - still reading a lot you know mostly
23:54 - about the epidemic frankly
23:57 - i'm not reading as many books as i used
24:00 - to because the stuff about the epidemic
24:02 - every day there's just so much new yeah
24:04 - it's not even in books it's online
24:06 - exactly
24:07 - and by the way one great thing about
24:09 - code break this format that we're doing
24:10 - we've designed it so students can even
24:12 - participate on smartphones so even in
24:15 - families that don't have computers can
24:16 - be watching and lots are
24:18 - sophia has a question which i think is
24:20 - on behalf of literally every student in
24:23 - the world so if you want to ask your
24:24 - question do you think schools will open
24:26 - up against fall i mean nobody knows for
24:29 - sure but what are the
24:30 - odds i'm pretty optimistic uh
24:35 - but
24:36 - you know we can't say for sure what's
24:38 - going to happen is that
24:40 - we'll get through this first peak
24:43 - in the united states and many other
24:45 - countries
24:46 - and then we'll
24:48 - want to open up somewhat so you know
24:50 - some people will be going back to work
24:53 - although probably wearing masks and
24:54 - still trying to distance from each other
24:57 - and
24:58 - by the fall we should have
25:00 - uh better treatments for the diseases so
25:03 - it's not as risky uh as it is now
25:06 - uh
25:07 - you know we'll be
25:09 - getting closer to a vaccine but we won't
25:11 - have a vaccine until sometime next year
25:13 - you know we'll understand why young
25:15 - people don't seem to get uh infected
25:18 - this much or and you know don't get
25:20 - serious disease you know so maybe
25:23 - uh if they're careful
25:24 - uh that you know having school back in
25:27 - place doesn't create a large risk so i
25:30 - you know i'm i think it's likely but
25:33 - there's a few months here where we need
25:35 - to learn about the disease you know for
25:37 - example we don't know
25:38 - if it's seasonal most respiratory
25:41 - viruses including the flu which is the
25:43 - most common
25:44 - uh respiratory virus are
25:47 - rhinovirus that causes the common cold
25:49 - or
25:50 - these other forms of chronovirus uh that
25:52 - were benign that came before
25:55 - they're seasonal and that would mean
25:57 - that
25:58 - you could get um
26:01 - in the summer less spread but then as
26:04 - the fall came you might see a rebound
26:06 - there and the key is going to be having
26:08 - lots of testing
26:10 - so that we can start to see their
26:12 - pockets
26:13 - it won't be as uniform as it is right
26:15 - now there'll be many places that have it
26:17 - under control and then there'll be
26:18 - rebounds in a few places and those
26:21 - places may have to tighten up their
26:22 - policies so uh you know schools are
26:25 - going to have to be agile i think they
26:27 - will meet in person but they might face
26:30 - a situation that you know for a month
26:32 - you would go back in if that particular
26:35 - location was seen to see spread you
26:36 - might have to go back online for a month
26:39 - and
26:40 - um you know so we have to prepare for
26:42 - that eventuality
26:44 - but you know i'm i feel really bad
26:46 - for the students who've missed out like
26:48 - three months of school
26:50 - particularly if their school isn't set
26:52 - up uh to provide the online connection
26:55 - yeah well hopefully they can spend that
26:57 - time whether on khan academy or on
26:58 - code.org to keep up
27:00 - so bill we're learning about simulations
27:02 - and and modeling
27:04 - today
27:05 - scientists have been studying medicine
27:07 - disease for centuries and you know
27:09 - vaccines were invented in the 1700s
27:12 - antibiotics were invented in the 1900s
27:14 - in this century what's different about
27:16 - medicine that's uniquely possible thanks
27:18 - to computers and computer science
27:22 - well we're if this epidemic could come
27:25 - along say 10 years ago
27:28 - there's a lot of things that would be
27:30 - worse both in terms of our
27:32 - ability to do medical work and in terms
27:34 - of our be able to stay in touch i mean
27:36 - things like you know the call we're
27:37 - doing today there wasn't the bandwidth
27:40 - or capability uh you know you couldn't
27:43 - do netflix you couldn't do these
27:45 - business meetings people are doing so
27:47 - you know the internet is helping uh
27:49 - reduce the pain a little bit
27:52 - in biology
27:54 - now we can actually sequence things it's
27:56 - so cheap to sequence things we can
27:58 - understand things about who's infecting
28:00 - who
28:01 - we can discover antibodies very quickly
28:04 - and
28:05 - make tests based on those antibodies
28:08 - so eventually we'll have a little strip
28:09 - test that instead of having to send the
28:12 - sample the swab up in your nose
28:14 - into a big machine which is called the
28:16 - pcr machine you'll be able to
28:19 - take that swab put it in liquid and then
28:21 - pour that on a piece of paper and it'll
28:23 - indicate our do you have some of the
28:25 - virus and therefore you should be
28:28 - isolating yourself and getting that
28:30 - skilled up
28:31 - you know it looks like in the next six
28:33 - months we'll get a lot of those and
28:35 - that's based on uh you know new
28:37 - technology
28:39 - also the ability to make these drugs
28:42 - very quickly and test them uh
28:45 - you know we have these mass assay
28:47 - capabilities that have come along in the
28:49 - last 10 years and so treatments that's
28:51 - an area that i'm seeing you know fairly
28:54 - quick response we have scientists
28:56 - sharing all over the world uh you know
28:59 - trying to figure out what are the
29:00 - symptoms you know because we don't have
29:03 - enough tests for everybody if we can
29:04 - figure out what symptoms
29:06 - might indicate that you have disease
29:08 - then we can give the test just to those
29:10 - people
29:11 - and so uh you know we'll find out very
29:14 - quickly
29:15 - uh who's
29:17 - who's at risk and then uh trace their
29:19 - contacts
29:20 - um we're not we weren't just ready for
29:22 - this epidemic as we should have been uh
29:25 - there were people including myself that
29:28 - worried about this and spoke a bit about
29:30 - it uh some work was done to
29:32 - make vaccines faster because they
29:34 - usually take five years to create
29:36 - here we're hoping uh that you know
29:39 - somewhere between a year and two years
29:41 - we'll get a vaccine uh which is pretty
29:43 - unheard of but we have like
29:46 - uh over a hundred efforts around the
29:47 - world ten of which look very promising
29:50 - and uh you know if this had come ten
29:52 - years from now i think we would have had
29:54 - the tests out more quickly in the
29:56 - vaccine more quickly
29:58 - and when something's spreading
30:00 - exponentially it's hard for people to
30:02 - appreciate just acting a month earlier
30:05 - you know would have been like you know
30:07 - 30 times better
30:08 - uh
30:10 - exponential stuff you know we we should
30:12 - show people with software how you know
30:14 - it's either doing this if your
30:16 - reproduction rate is greater than one or
30:18 - it's doing this if your reproduction
30:21 - rate gets below one and you know that's
30:23 - where a lot of the us's today is because
30:26 - of these drastic actions which and
30:28 - caused big problems that reproductive
30:30 - that exponential number
30:32 - is below one
30:34 - uh but sadly as we open up and some
30:37 - places will go too far and it'll get
30:39 - back to say two
30:41 - and that runs the risk of filling up the
30:43 - hospitals again and we're actually later
30:45 - in this episode we're gonna walk through
30:46 - modeling in a spreadsheet how you do
30:48 - that because these models and
30:50 - simulations are exactly how people are
30:51 - figuring out how to slow down the virus
30:53 - um we want to give a chance to the
30:55 - audience to have an opportunity to
30:56 - engage with you bill uh so folks have
30:59 - submitted questions and i'd like to
31:00 - invite akira gilbert who helps us run
31:02 - code break to introduce the various
31:04 - student questions akira are you there
31:07 - i am how are you up how are you hottie
31:10 - i'm great thanks
31:11 - yeah and hello bill so last week we put
31:14 - out a call to students around the world
31:15 - to ask one question to bill gates so
31:17 - today we have our top video selection as
31:19 - well as some excited panelists that you
31:21 - can see on screen and first i'd like to
31:23 - introduce aisha cortez who is from
31:26 - puerto rico aisha are you ready you
31:28 - should be unmuted
31:29 - yes hi hi bill gates in haiti
31:34 - are you sure do you have your question
31:36 - yes okay um my question is what advice
31:39 - would you give to the parents the
31:41 - teachers and students who are working
31:43 - from home
31:46 - well it it takes a little more
31:48 - discipline i think to
31:51 - uh learn from home i you know you don't
31:54 - have everybody sitting there
31:57 - uh if you get confused
31:59 - it's a little harder to reach out and
32:01 - uh and sometimes it's hard to stay
32:03 - motivated hard to stay focused you know
32:05 - your siblings are running around and
32:08 - uh
32:09 - you know that that can be tricky
32:11 - i do think uh you know some students are
32:13 - going to actually learn more
32:15 - it'll be interesting what they learn
32:16 - about themselves and their ability to
32:19 - uh look online you know some of the
32:21 - online material whether it's lectures or
32:24 - exercises are just really super good and
32:26 - of course you do get to go at your own
32:28 - pace if you're confused about something
32:30 - you can go back
32:31 - uh look at it
32:33 - uh i know a lot of parents are kind of
32:35 - frustrated that if their students are
32:37 - studying a subject they don't know they
32:39 - feel like oh i wish i could help out
32:42 - uh you know so
32:44 - still you know reaching out to your
32:46 - friends particularly your friends who
32:47 - are really good
32:48 - at the subject uh and sitting and
32:51 - talking think throughs i think that's
32:52 - important you can get discouraged if you
32:54 - you're just totally studying on your own
32:56 - and you can share
32:58 - you know where you're understanding
32:59 - stuff share that with other other
33:01 - students uh
33:03 - and you know you still should get
33:05 - outside a little bit if you're allowed
33:07 - to uh you know and get refreshed so you
33:10 - don't
33:11 - overwhelm yourself but i can sit in
33:12 - front of the screen for a long
33:14 - uh period of time you know sometimes i i
33:17 - stay up a lot later than i should if i
33:19 - run into some really good
33:20 - good online lectures
33:23 - well
33:24 - thank you
33:26 - thank you aisha and thank you bill um
33:28 - i'd now like to invite bennett schwartz
33:30 - from new jersey to share his question
33:32 - bennett are you ready you should be
33:34 - unheated
33:36 - hi mr grades i'm bennett schwartz and
33:38 - i'm eight years old i am an avid coder
33:41 - what can i do at home with my own coding
33:43 - to help with this pandemic
33:47 - well i think uh
33:49 - you know pandemic
33:50 - is an opportunity to look at many
33:52 - different things there's a
33:55 - group called neck strain
33:57 - that's got a website where they show how
33:59 - they're sequencing the virus and how
34:01 - it's changing over time
34:04 - and there's a lot of data there that you
34:06 - could write programs to try and
34:07 - visualize there's a lot of data you know
34:10 - like different states uh
34:12 - you know compared to their population
34:14 - are having different uh number of cases
34:17 - different numbers of deaths the trend
34:19 - over time so you know in terms of
34:22 - navigating data and graphing data to
34:25 - show interesting trends you know i think
34:28 - there's an immense amount that can do
34:29 - that that could even contribute
34:31 - to people's understanding the actual
34:34 - simulation
34:36 - of which activities put us at risk the
34:39 - modelers are having a very tough time
34:41 - with that and because it's exponential
34:43 - if you get just a few parameters that we
34:45 - don't really know you get them wrong you
34:47 - can over predict or under predict
34:50 - and
34:51 - the model that's actually been the most
34:54 - successful
34:55 - is more of a statistical model more of a
34:57 - trend following model that a group i
34:59 - fund called international health metrics
35:02 - and evaluation is done it's at
35:03 - healthdata.org
35:05 - so i'd encourage you to look at that but
35:07 - uh data visualization is something that
35:11 - i think
35:12 - is an exciting thing and then code isn't
35:14 - that complicated to try and look at data
35:17 - in different ways
35:18 - uh you know there's different runtime
35:20 - libraries that can help with that or you
35:21 - can uh write the code for that yourself
35:24 - uh so it's great everybody's being open
35:26 - about how many cases they have and
35:28 - deaths and the trends on those things we
35:30 - need insights that pour out that will
35:32 - help us set the right policies
35:37 - thank you so much bennett um so last
35:40 - week we actually had our audience submit
35:41 - video questions for bill to answer live
35:43 - on our show we have one question from
35:45 - andrew casey who's a literacy coach and
35:48 - he joined
35:50 - in with his family in halifax canada
35:58 - considering we are in a world of
36:00 - connectivity and what way do you foresee
36:02 - students within our schools can connect
36:04 - with those in situations of high needs
36:06 - throughout the globe to help with early
36:08 - literacy
36:10 - we are a nation in canada of diverse
36:12 - languages and cultures and as an
36:13 - elementary teacher myself i see an
36:15 - opportunity for global book buddies
36:25 - you know the
36:26 - you know the use of digital which we're
36:29 - all uh
36:30 - you know doing a lot more than uh
36:34 - we've ever
36:35 - done in the past it definitely uh
36:39 - it makes us think okay how can we reach
36:41 - out to other people you know whether
36:43 - it's mentoring
36:45 - uh tutoring
36:46 - uh just you know
36:48 - getting in touch with people from other
36:50 - cultures you know particularly the
36:52 - disease is is going to be worse in the
36:54 - developing countries which is uh
36:57 - uh although the number of cases are
36:58 - still pretty low you know it's likely uh
37:01 - to be
37:03 - much worse there
37:05 - and so
37:08 - you know i think you're right that
37:10 - the
37:10 - you know who can do tutoring who can
37:13 - share ideas
37:14 - uh even you know you do need to have a
37:17 - common language still the translation
37:18 - isn't good enough to
37:20 - uh avoid uh that requirement uh but we
37:24 - ought to be able to find you know
37:26 - there's a lot of older people who would
37:27 - love to mentor and tutor
37:29 - uh who are almost kind of isolated and
37:32 - matching them up with students that
37:33 - would benefit from that even if they're
37:35 - not uh in the same country
37:38 - uh
37:39 - a lot a lot that could be done there to
37:41 - take the idle time and and put it to
37:43 - good use
37:48 - thank you for that um and so now we have
37:51 - time for a question that was submitted
37:53 - by our audience in our q a this question
37:55 - comes in from susanna and she said how
37:58 - important is imagination when doing work
38:00 - with computer science what exercises do
38:02 - you do to stimulate your imagination and
38:04 - how do you think that's contributed to
38:06 - your success
38:09 - well of course you you don't want to
38:11 - write the same program that everybody
38:12 - else has written uh
38:14 - you know first trying to do the kind of
38:17 - standard problems helps you understand
38:19 - data structures and algorithms
38:21 - uh but then you know the real value
38:23 - added is when you think okay what can i
38:26 - do that hasn't been done
38:28 - uh by somebody else before
38:30 - now you can be very inspired uh from
38:33 - people who've done uh you know fantastic
38:36 - work in the past
38:37 - uh but it's
38:39 - you know it's kind of uh
38:41 - you know trusting that
38:43 - you know your wild ideas will sometimes
38:45 - be right about things i remember i tried
38:47 - to write
38:48 - programs for things
38:50 - uh
38:51 - you know i tried to do this huge
38:53 - baseball simulation program and it
38:55 - turned out that was
38:56 - way too ambitious i
38:59 - you know the computers and the software
39:01 - of the time just
39:02 - didn't let me do it so you can sometimes
39:04 - uh reach too far
39:06 - uh
39:07 - in in things but you know you're going
39:09 - to be motivated to really learn how to
39:11 - program if you think there's something
39:13 - cool
39:14 - for some people that's a way of looking
39:16 - at data some people that's a way of uh
39:19 - making a game
39:21 - uh you know sometimes it's actually
39:23 - solving a problem and so
39:25 - uh
39:26 - you know everybody everybody should you
39:29 - know push themselves to think okay my my
39:31 - programming where can i contribute to
39:33 - the world
39:38 - thank you so much and for our last
39:40 - question i actually like to head back
39:42 - over to our student panel and introduce
39:44 - fiona from colorado um it's earth day
39:47 - and she had a climate change question so
39:48 - fiona are you ready to share you should
39:50 - be unmuted at this point yeah
39:52 - hi bill
39:56 - um
39:57 - what is a big project the gates
39:59 - foundation is working on to cope with
40:01 - climate change
40:04 - yeah climate change of course is a huge
40:07 - looming problem and you know before the
40:08 - pandemic
40:10 - we might have identified it as one of
40:11 - the problems we're not
40:13 - putting enough effort into
40:16 - because over time it'll be such a big
40:18 - deal
40:19 - it's a challenge because we have to
40:21 - change that not only the way we
40:23 - make electricity but the way we do
40:25 - transportation the way we
40:27 - grow food the way we make materials like
40:30 - cement and steel
40:33 - and
40:33 - even though i'm mostly working on the
40:35 - pandemic i'm still keeping some of the
40:37 - climate change work up it's going to
40:39 - require incredible technology innovation
40:42 - you know one of the simulations uh
40:46 - is the
40:47 - uh what's the electricity grid going to
40:49 - look like because it's we're putting
40:52 - unreliable sources intermittent sources
40:54 - like sun and wind in where we used to
40:56 - have uh constant
40:58 - uh things that wouldn't all go away at
41:01 - the same time like a coal plant or a
41:02 - natural gas plant that now we have to
41:04 - get rid of uh so you know i've been
41:07 - supporting uh the idea of energy storage
41:11 - which would help a lot or you know if
41:13 - nuclear reactors could be much cheaper
41:15 - and safer
41:16 - that could help a lot and i created a
41:18 - venture
41:19 - thing called breakthrough energy
41:20 - ventures
41:21 - that's out investing in uh now over 30
41:24 - companies
41:26 - uh that have these ideas of
41:28 - making steel a new way so we need we
41:31 - need a lot of innovation the cost of
41:34 - doing things in a greenway is so
41:36 - expensive that even if rich countries
41:38 - chose to do it
41:40 - the countries like india um you know as
41:43 - they're trying to build new cities and
41:45 - provide light
41:47 - and thing air conditioning things we
41:49 - take for granted if if the premium the
41:52 - so-called green premium is still as high
41:54 - as it is today
41:56 - you know they won't be able to shipped
41:57 - over uh and so the us
42:00 - even though we have to cut our 15 of
42:02 - emissions we have to do more than that
42:03 - we also have to do the innovation to
42:06 - make it economic for all countries to go
42:09 - along with these green approaches so
42:11 - our foundation helps farmers uh
42:14 - and because they are going to suffer the
42:16 - most you know the bad weather
42:18 - is meaning that the crops fail which for
42:20 - a subsistence farmer means they don't
42:22 - have enough to eat so the pain of
42:24 - climate change
42:26 - uh is already evident uh
42:28 - in the the places where people live the
42:31 - the toughest lives so giving them better
42:33 - seeds helping them out
42:35 - uh that's called uh
42:37 - uh adaptation
42:39 - and then reducing the emissions which is
42:41 - called mitigation both of those are a
42:43 - big deal
42:44 - and uh you know i hope we don't get too
42:46 - distracted away from that or at least
42:48 - get back to it
42:50 - uh as we get the pandemic over
42:53 - thank you bill so much for inspiring
42:55 - students about the ways we can help
42:57 - solve these problems you know computer
42:58 - science is increasingly becoming part of
43:00 - the school curriculum and six studies
43:02 - have now shown that students who learn
43:04 - coding and computer science go on to
43:06 - outperform in reading and writing math
43:08 - and science and they're even more likely
43:10 - to enroll in college but with great
43:12 - power comes great responsibility and as
43:14 - we celebrate the 50-year anniversary of
43:15 - earth day it's so important that
43:17 - educators make sure computer science is
43:19 - taught equitably and that students like
43:21 - the ones here are inspired to learn to
43:22 - harness technology for good
43:25 - i have one last question i want to ask
43:26 - you i know you're short on time with
43:28 - millions of coronavirus infections
43:30 - globally many people are pointing
43:32 - fingers placing blame and deepening
43:34 - political divides but we're all going to
43:36 - look back one day and this is going to
43:37 - be one of the greatest trials the human
43:39 - race has ever faced what are the some of
43:41 - the best things you've seen people do to
43:42 - support each other and what would be a
43:44 - message you can send about how we can
43:46 - use this pandemic as an opportunity to
43:48 - bring the world together rather than
43:49 - stray apart
43:52 - yeah this is a bit like a war but
43:54 - in this case all of humanity
43:57 - is fighting the virus and so
44:00 - every bit of understanding
44:02 - uh that can be developed
44:04 - you know helps all of us
44:07 - so it doesn't really matter which
44:08 - country the vaccine comes from or the
44:10 - drug that's a therapy or even the
44:12 - understanding of what type of opening up
44:15 - how you can do it in such a way uh that
44:17 - you don't get more cases and so you know
44:19 - we're looking at germany and sweden and
44:22 - denmark
44:23 - who are a little ahead doing this
44:25 - opening up and trying to see okay
44:28 - what happens there
44:29 - uh you know sadly some people are trying
44:32 - to
44:33 - uh
44:34 - you know point fingers at other
44:35 - countries because of course the
44:36 - infection has spread by international
44:39 - travel
44:40 - and you know international travel will
44:42 - be greatly reduced so hopefully
44:45 - that's not a permanent thing in terms of
44:47 - uh
44:48 - the international commerce or exchange
44:50 - of ideas that have built up the trust
44:52 - and
44:53 - uh working together i am seeing uh at
44:56 - the scientific level it is pretty
44:58 - amazing i mean the chinese even in the
45:00 - early days were publishing the
45:03 - the gene sequence and now the number of
45:05 - papers coming out
45:07 - uh that international collaborations and
45:09 - you know clearly they
45:11 - in order to make
45:12 - uh
45:13 - the vaccine we're gonna have to have
45:15 - factories in many many many countries
45:18 - and multiple companies collaborating on
45:20 - that
45:21 - and
45:22 - you know wow everybody's got this has
45:25 - their attention
45:26 - uh and so you know we have to see great
45:29 - international collaboration we also see
45:32 - crazy rumors but i don't think that many
45:35 - people are paying attention to those i
45:37 - hope not
45:38 - uh you know there's a big triumph
45:40 - that'll come here based on
45:42 - the scientists of the world working
45:43 - together you know uh and
45:46 - so i'm optimistic about
45:48 - uh you know that we've got all of
45:51 - humanity working towards a common goal
45:56 - thanks so much bill thanks so much for
45:58 - inspiring us uh and i know i speak on
46:00 - behalf of all of us that we really
46:02 - appreciate you joining us today uh we
46:04 - have all the students on camera right
46:05 - now everybody could all wave and say
46:07 - goodbye to bill to and thank you thank
46:09 - you guys that was great it was fun
46:12 - good to see you all thanks buddy
46:14 - bye-bye
46:15 - bye-bye
46:17 - all right so now we're going to take a
46:18 - quick break for a trivia question it's
46:20 - trivia time
46:23 - so since we just met with bill gates
46:25 - today's trivia question is which was
46:27 - released first the first version of
46:29 - microsoft excel or the first version of
46:31 - microsoft windows
46:33 - and this is going to show up as a as a
46:35 - zoom poll for those of you who are
46:36 - joining us live on zoom those of you who
46:39 - are on youtube or facebook we're going
46:40 - to share the answers soon but which came
46:42 - first microsoft excel or microsoft
46:45 - windows
46:46 - kind of a tough question
46:49 - right we're collecting answers in real
46:51 - time from thousands of people let's
46:53 - share the results
46:55 - all right so most of you guessed that
46:57 - windows came first and some of you said
46:59 - that excel came first then a small group
47:01 - said that both came at the same time
47:04 - so i'm going to show the results on
47:05 - screen
47:06 - just one second
47:09 - uh and this is a very short history
47:11 - lesson in microsoft windows 1.0 was
47:14 - released on november 20 1985. that was
47:17 - 35 years ago and it was the first
47:19 - version of the microsoft windows line
47:21 - this is what it looked like sophia does
47:23 - this look like your computer no no
47:26 - um but it turns out microsoft excel was
47:28 - released earlier 51 days earlier and was
47:32 - released for the macintosh operating
47:34 - system in september 30 1985
47:37 - and this is what microsoft excel used to
47:39 - look like 35 years ago okay
47:42 - um so yeah it's kind of interesting and
47:43 - in fact excel for windows took two more
47:46 - years before it came out now speaking of
47:48 - excel
47:49 - this is going to take us to the next
47:51 - part of our episode
47:52 - which is just as bill talked about how
47:54 - scientists use data on simulation to
47:56 - look at accidental growth we're going to
47:58 - learn about how to estimate the spread
48:00 - of a virus and we're going to use
48:02 - microsoft excel as our tool for doing
48:05 - that
48:06 - so i'm going to share my screen again to
48:09 - do this
48:10 - just one second
48:13 - and what we're going to do is show what
48:15 - it's like
48:16 - to model the spread of a virus
48:18 - now this is going to be a very
48:20 - simplistic model but it's going to
48:21 - familiarize us with how exponential
48:23 - growth can get really big and how uh how
48:26 - delicate is and how scientists are using
48:28 - actually computer science to protect us
48:31 - so let's start by asking how many people
48:34 - does an average person
48:37 - meet in a day so if what would you say
48:39 - like five or ten or twenty let's say ten
48:42 - let's do ten right so if an average
48:44 - person meets ten people in one day
48:46 - so what's the chance
48:49 - that an infected person
48:52 - passes the disease when they meet
48:54 - somebody should we say like one percent
48:57 - two percent two percent two percent so
48:59 - if you run into somebody and they're
49:00 - infected and there's a two percent
49:02 - chance you get it from them so then each
49:04 - day
49:05 - one infected person
49:07 - infects how many more point two right
49:11 - point two yeah they're going to meet ten
49:13 - people and there's a two percent chance
49:14 - and we can calculate this with an
49:16 - equation we can say equals
49:18 - this
49:19 - times
49:20 - that
49:22 - so points each one infected person
49:24 - infects
49:25 - 0.2 people
49:26 - now let's model the growth of a virus
49:30 - just using those very simple assumptions
49:32 - and i'm not assuming how many people
49:34 - die or how many recover or if we have
49:37 - any other things just at this very basic
49:39 - thing and if we start with 500 people on
49:42 - one day and i'm going to put january
49:44 - 22nd here because that's the day that
49:45 - the coronavirus had had 500 people uh
49:49 - and then if i say what happens the next
49:50 - day so if it's this day plus one
49:55 - we're going to have
49:56 - the next day the same 500 people
49:59 - plus
50:01 - a new
50:02 - set of infections which is this people
50:04 - this set of people multiplied by 0.2
50:09 - so basically
50:10 - 500 people who already had the infection
50:12 - and each one of them brings on 0.2 more
50:15 - so then what happens one day later
50:18 - those 600 people infect 720
50:21 - and then one day later those 720 and i'm
50:24 - just copying down these formulas and i
50:26 - can copy them way down to here
50:29 - all the way to april 22nd
50:33 - and we get a whole bunch of people
50:36 - and now if i actually want to chart this
50:38 - growth
50:40 - i can insert a chart
50:43 - so i'm going to say insert
50:45 - chart
50:48 - and this can now chart the growth of the
50:50 - virus using these very simplistic
50:52 - assumptions
50:54 - now
50:55 - what you'll see right now is this font
50:57 - is a little small so let me change the
50:58 - font so everybody can see it
51:00 - with this tiny font you can see
51:03 - in just the three months we reached 8
51:05 - billion people which is the entire human
51:08 - population would get the virus with
51:09 - these assumptions now what's interesting
51:12 - about exponential growth is how small
51:13 - changes can make a difference so if we
51:16 - had people meeting each other just a
51:17 - little bit less like each person meets
51:19 - nine people a day
51:20 - suddenly instead of 10 billion people we
51:22 - got to 1.8 billion if each person met
51:25 - only eight people in a given day
51:27 - suddenly that top line growth became
51:29 - only 350 million
51:32 - what would happen if we all started
51:33 - washing our hands more which of these
51:34 - numbers would change
51:38 - the second one the two percent chance
51:40 - you're less likely to get the disease if
51:41 - you if you wash your hands so let's say
51:43 - it's a 1.5
51:45 - chance you get the disease now it's 14
51:47 - million people or if you said there's a
51:49 - one percent chance you get the disease
51:52 - now only 500 000 people get the disease
51:54 - and if we distance ourselves even more
51:56 - so the average person only needs three
51:58 - people a day
52:00 - wow now only 7 000 people get the
52:02 - disease it's a complete difference
52:05 - small numbers can make a huge difference
52:08 - now this is basically fake data we're
52:09 - making up but scientists are looking at
52:11 - the real data that looks like this and
52:14 - we're actually going to share out to all
52:15 - of you real data that is live that shows
52:17 - in every state in the united states on
52:20 - any given date how many cases there were
52:22 - and how many deaths and in every country
52:25 - uh
52:26 - oops these are all states as well but we
52:28 - have data for basically every state and
52:30 - every country showing how many people
52:32 - have gotten this disease now if you have
52:34 - this data on excel you can click here on
52:36 - ideas and excel will help you visualize
52:39 - it
52:42 - but instead of doing that what i'm going
52:44 - to do is we're going to switch the next
52:45 - part of our episode which is going to be
52:48 - about talking about
52:49 - visualizing data
52:51 - oops
52:52 - visualizing data and to do this we're
52:55 - going to bring on
52:56 - hannah
52:57 - hannah walden is going to join us and
52:59 - hannah is one of the top computer
53:00 - science teachers at code.org she's
53:02 - actually the author of the cs principles
53:04 - curriculum which is the most popular
53:06 - high school course in computer science
53:08 - and it's a wonderful course and in fact
53:09 - what she's going to be walking us
53:10 - through is going to be part of what
53:12 - students are going to do in that course
53:13 - later this year uh hannah are you there
53:16 - with us
53:17 - hi hottie can you hear me
53:19 - yep i can hear you but i didn't can you
53:21 - say hi again
53:22 - hello
53:25 - all right i think zoom may be acting up
53:27 - on us we may be having a bug sophia do
53:30 - you got your bug ready
53:32 - all right
53:34 - all right continue calling us from
53:35 - hannah
53:36 - so i am calling from maine and i am here
53:39 - with my daughter ava av you want to say
53:41 - hi hi
53:44 - hi ava how old are you
53:46 - i'm 17.
53:48 - so ava is my daughter she's joining me
53:50 - here in maine we are social distancing
53:52 - together
53:54 - here in our house and i'm going to try
53:56 - to pull up my screen for all of you
53:58 - right now how do you think if you stop
53:59 - sharing your screen
54:02 - i believe i've stopped you have yes yes
54:04 - zoom is uh crashing on my computer so
54:07 - that's a lot of fun right now
54:09 - all right so hottie what i think that we
54:11 - should do right now is if you could take
54:13 - over this i'd like you to show the model
54:15 - again on your screen and i'm going to
54:17 - reload zoom on my end and i will rejoin
54:20 - in just a minute
54:22 - all right all right
54:24 - well i'm gonna go into screen sharing
54:26 - again
54:28 - and so if you pull out your bug
54:32 - so
54:33 - what hannah's gonna do is
54:35 - basically bring us to
54:37 - to show
54:38 - the same excel spreadsheet that we
54:40 - created that showed the number of deaths
54:41 - and we add and the number of cases from
54:44 - a virus what we're going to do is we're
54:46 - going to take data that looks like this
54:49 - that has data from every state and from
54:52 - every country
54:54 - and we're going to make our own app that
54:55 - basically graphs the growth of the virus
54:58 - uh and hannah if you're not ready there
55:00 - if your computer's still crashing i can
55:01 - i'm ready honey i think we're here
55:04 - all right
55:05 - yeah there you are
55:06 - all right let's do this
55:08 - okay so i'm gonna share my screen
55:11 - here we go
55:14 - all right so we are looking at app lub
55:16 - right here and ava's gonna be my pair
55:18 - programming partner and we are going to
55:21 - program an app to visualize the data
55:23 - that hottie just showed so uh let's get
55:26 - started here i'm going to actually show
55:27 - what this app is doing right now it's
55:30 - partially working we're going to finish
55:31 - it up so as i click run it's loading and
55:35 - now we're going to pick a u.s state or
55:37 - territory to visualize ava where are we
55:38 - going to start let's do north carolina
55:41 - all right so we're going to do north
55:42 - carolina here we go
55:44 - and what's happening here ava what are
55:46 - we seeing so we're looking at the north
55:48 - carolina kevin 19 cases and deaths on
55:50 - any given day right so as i as i mouse
55:54 - over or i click on the line i can see
55:56 - the data points for any given day and
55:58 - now if i go to country and i choose a
56:00 - country ava what country should i choose
56:02 - the bahamas ooh nice and warm in the
56:05 - bahamas
56:06 - let's go there okay um but nothing's
56:09 - showing up ava why is that because we
56:11 - didn't add the chart we need to add the
56:13 - chart so if you remember from previous
56:15 - episodes we showed you that in design
56:17 - mode you can set up your app so i'm
56:19 - going to go to design mode now and ava's
56:21 - going to take over and show us how to
56:23 - add a chart to our app all right so to
56:25 - add a chart you can either drag over the
56:27 - chart button or to make things a lot
56:29 - easier you can click on the chart that
56:31 - you've already created
56:32 - and you can duplicate it and drag it
56:34 - down
56:36 - yeah all right i'm going to make my
56:38 - screen just a little bit wider
56:40 - so we can see things a little bit easier
56:42 - there we go okay so we've created a
56:44 - chart and now let's go code it
56:47 - so up at the top of the code this may
56:50 - look like a lot of code to you but
56:52 - what's happening here is this is starter
56:54 - code that is pulling in the spreadsheets
56:57 - that hottie just showed you so we've
56:59 - done the work for you and when we share
57:01 - out this app later with you you can take
57:03 - a look you can unpack all of these start
57:06 - web request blocks and read our comments
57:08 - and see how all this works but we've got
57:10 - it set up so that we can just focus down
57:12 - at this bottom part and set up things so
57:15 - we're going to go right down to the
57:16 - bottom
57:17 - and this is the area where we set up our
57:19 - charts
57:20 - so ava
57:21 - first we need to make sure that we're
57:22 - sending it to the right chart we're
57:24 - going to draw the correct chart so what
57:25 - do we need to do here we need to call
57:27 - chart
57:28 - two
57:29 - okay so we're gonna we're gonna draw
57:31 - chart two and right now it's set to be a
57:34 - bar chart what type of chart were we
57:35 - using we want a line chart all right so
57:37 - let's set a line chart and let's run it
57:41 - and here we go the data is loading once
57:44 - it's done it will swap to the next
57:45 - screen where we can visualize it here we
57:48 - go all right i have another another
57:49 - state let's do connecticut connecticut
57:51 - it is
57:52 - and
57:53 - one more country to france france okay
57:58 - and our app is working and this is an
58:01 - interesting app it helps us to compare
58:03 - different states different countries get
58:05 - that information but as i was hearing
58:08 - hadi and i was hearing bill gates talk
58:10 - about using computer science for good i
58:13 - was thinking about how we can use these
58:15 - visually visualizations as inspiration
58:18 - and what we can do now that we have this
58:20 - knowledge so i've been working on an app
58:22 - that i'd like to share with you now
58:25 - and this is the main kovad19 data app uh
58:29 - ava for those who don't know where is
58:32 - maine located so maine is in the
58:34 - northeast of the united states upper
58:36 - corner and it is very cold
58:39 - yes and in fact it snowed last night
58:42 - so a little colder
58:44 - yes it did
58:47 - so here we've got our app and it's got
58:49 - the same starter code up at the top
58:51 - we're loading our chart just like we did
58:53 - in the other app
58:54 - but now
58:56 - we have some new buttons down here that
58:58 - take us to helpful websites that will
59:01 - give us kind of
59:02 - interesting information that we can use
59:04 - then to help our community so i've got a
59:06 - button down here it says sewing masks
59:08 - for me if i click on this button it's
59:10 - going to take me to this website and on
59:13 - this website there's information about
59:16 - how to sew masks how to make them the
59:18 - correct way how to volunteer um and then
59:21 - hooking up with people who uh who need
59:23 - those masks um so
59:25 - ava
59:27 - tell me about your sewing skills um
59:29 - they're not very good
59:30 - okay
59:32 - so maybe this volunteer opportunity
59:34 - isn't isn't quite the right one for you
59:35 - but let's see if we can find another one
59:38 - so let's go back here and we're going to
59:39 - add another button here so ava can you
59:42 - walk me through how to do that all right
59:44 - so we're going to go to the home screen
59:46 - and you can select the sewing mac master
59:49 - remain and you can duplicate it all
59:52 - right so we're going to create a button
59:52 - that looks just like the other one so it
59:54 - looks nice and neat
59:55 - and what are we going to call it
59:56 - volunteer button okay so this is our
59:58 - volume tier button
60:01 - and what text is going to display we're
60:03 - going to display volunteer opportunities
60:07 - perfect
60:08 - all right so
60:10 - uh now we have our button all set and
60:12 - now where is that butt gonna go
60:14 - so i did a little research beforehand
60:16 - and i found a website called the main
60:18 - ready website and this website has all
60:21 - sorts of volunteer uh opportunities
60:23 - essential volunteer opportunities in
60:25 - maine so these are the volunteer
60:26 - opportunities that are safe to
60:28 - participate in that are essential for
60:30 - the state and good ways to get connected
60:33 - so again this is our local community we
60:34 - want to support them so i'm going to
60:36 - copy this url and go back here
60:39 - and now ava what am i going to do
60:42 - to
60:43 - program this button
60:45 - i'm going to need to create an on event
60:48 - all right
60:50 - so let's go over here to my toolbox i'm
60:52 - going to grab an on event and
60:55 - pop it in here
60:56 - okay and then you need to
60:59 - create the open link
61:01 - right first off i'm gonna make sure that
61:02 - we're connecting to the volunteer button
61:04 - yes and i'm gonna use the open block
61:07 - that's down here it's a yellow block in
61:09 - the ui controls
61:11 - drawer and i'm going to drag it over
61:14 - and here's how the open block works
61:17 - i have the command open and then over
61:19 - here i have a string where i'm going to
61:21 - put the url the website the web link
61:23 - that i'm going to go to the address so i
61:26 - going to copy paste that in there
61:29 - and now we're all set and we're ready to
61:30 - go one last thing actually
61:32 - let's actually change our chart up a
61:34 - little bit so i'm going to hit run just
61:36 - so we can see how things are set up i'm
61:38 - not going to test my button just yet but
61:40 - we're almost there so i've got a green
61:43 - line and a purple line here but what if
61:45 - i wanted to change the way my chart
61:46 - looks
61:47 - ava can you give me two other colors i
61:49 - could use
61:50 - orange okay
61:53 - and blue perfect that's some good colors
61:56 - okay
61:57 - we're gonna have some good contrast
61:58 - there that's a good good thing to think
62:00 - about when you're charting so i'm going
62:02 - to click run
62:03 - and let's look at this chart now
62:07 - the data is loading we don't want to
62:08 - visualize the chart before the data is
62:10 - ready here it is we have a nice orange
62:12 - line and a blue line very visible great
62:15 - and now i if i'm using this app i'm
62:18 - seeing the trend in my state and i'm
62:20 - ready to click on different links that
62:22 - will give me information what can i do
62:23 - now that i see the trends now that i
62:25 - know what's happening in my state what
62:26 - can i do about it so let's actually test
62:29 - out the button that we added but to do
62:31 - that what we're going to do instead of
62:33 - testing it here on the screen is i'm
62:35 - going to click the share button so all
62:36 - of you at home can test this out with us
62:38 - sophia are you ready with your phone too
62:42 - all right so i'm going to put up the qr
62:45 - code i'm going to make it nice and big
62:48 - you can scan that qr code ava's going to
62:50 - scan it
62:52 - all right
62:53 - and
62:54 - i'm going to
62:55 - take this down for just a minute
62:58 - stop screen sharing
63:00 - so i can show you ava's phone and on
63:02 - ava's phone
63:04 - it's loading the data right now
63:07 - a little hard to see there ava can we
63:08 - hold it up there
63:09 - okay
63:10 - [Music]
63:11 - so
63:12 - yep there we go
63:13 - thousands of people loading the data all
63:15 - at the same time so i don't know if
63:16 - that's making it any harder oh that's a
63:18 - very good point everybody's loading it
63:20 - all at once so it's a little bit slow
63:22 - but what will happen eventually uh is
63:25 - the data will load and we'll be taken to
63:27 - that screen and we'll be able to test
63:29 - our button so let's actually go back to
63:30 - the screen share so we can see that
63:32 - really quick before we close this out
63:36 - so i'm going to go back here
63:38 - i'm going to close this down same time
63:40 - as well
63:43 - and if i click on my volunteer
63:44 - opportunities button
63:46 - it's going to take me it's going to give
63:48 - me a message asking if i want to open
63:50 - that link and i do and it will take me
63:51 - right here so that's what should happen
63:53 - on your app as well when you load it so
63:56 - i would say give it another 10 minutes
63:58 - or so uh and give it another try and
64:01 - we'll see if that works
64:04 - so this app was made
64:06 - hannah said uh if you could stop screen
64:08 - sharing for a second what we're going to
64:09 - do for anybody who wants to get that app
64:12 - that hannah shared out we're going to
64:14 - email
64:15 - multiple apps and the spreadsheets for
64:18 - people to follow on as your challenge
64:19 - for this week
64:20 - you'll certainly get the two apps that
64:22 - hannah and ava showed for us one
64:24 - visualized visualize
64:25 - states and countries where you can
64:26 - change your state and country and one
64:28 - which you can customize to your own
64:30 - country or your own u.s state and you
64:33 - can put whatever you want on it the
64:35 - starter code we give you pulls that live
64:37 - chronovirus data from the spreadsheet
64:39 - that i showed earlier and we'll also
64:42 - send you a link to that spreadsheet so
64:43 - you can do your own modeling or
64:45 - visualization in the spreadsheet and
64:47 - then lastly we'll also send
64:49 - the code to the
64:51 - the the simulation that sophia made with
64:54 - the little sprites moving all around
64:55 - infecting each other and we're going to
64:57 - challenge you to create a busy model and
65:00 - simulate what would it be to add a
65:01 - vaccine on top of washing your hands or
65:03 - to model and simulate
65:05 - how social distancing would work to get
65:07 - every one of these assignments you want
65:09 - to go to code.org break
65:12 - and sign up there and each week we'll
65:14 - send you the assignments for that week
65:16 - so whether it's creating your custom
65:17 - coronavirus tracking app for your
65:20 - location whether it's modeling and
65:21 - simulating the data better any of those
65:23 - things you can get from there
65:26 - i also want to remind you again by the
65:27 - way parents who are out there please
65:29 - support us at code.org if you go to
65:31 - code.org help or if you click the help
65:34 - us button
65:35 - we want your help to support the work at
65:36 - code.org to keep computer science free
65:39 - and you can buy our hats which are very
65:41 - very cool as well
65:43 - before we close i also want to say two
65:45 - more things first of all please spread
65:47 - the word to other families the more
65:49 - people we have joining code.org the
65:51 - better the special guests we're going to
65:52 - have and in fact next week's special
65:55 - guest i'm going to announce ahead of
65:56 - time there's two of them but one of them
65:58 - is going to be vint cerf the actual
66:00 - inventor of the internet is going to be
66:02 - joining us on code break uh and what's
66:05 - particularly neat about vint cerf is
66:06 - he's a relatively older guy
66:09 - and he actually just caught the
66:10 - coronavirus he's been struggling with it
66:13 - throughout the month of april and he
66:14 - just recovered in time to join us on
66:16 - code break next week so that's going to
66:18 - be pretty cool to see uh to see the
66:20 - actual inventor of the internet um
66:22 - there's also another special guest
66:24 - that'll be joining him as well so we'll
66:26 - announce that in a few days um but
66:28 - that's it for today's episode let's
66:30 - switch to folks on camera
66:32 - i also want to say since we're on uh
66:35 - since we're here on zoom i wanted to say
66:37 - one cool thing we can do that's the
66:38 - benefit of the pandemic is when you're
66:40 - on zoom in it doesn't matter how you're
66:42 - dressed because we're all at home and
66:44 - i'm proud to say i spoke to bill gates
66:47 - in my pajama pants
66:49 - which of course bill didn't know uh but
66:52 - thank you everybody and let's wave hi to
66:53 - the camera as we close today's code
66:55 - break and see you next week if you're
66:57 - studying alone take a code break bye-bye
67:00 - everybody
67:01 - [Music]
67:05 - all right
68:56 - you
