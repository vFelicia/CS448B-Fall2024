00:03 - welcome to computer science connections
00:05 - simulating a marine ecosystem this
00:08 - module makes connections between science
00:11 - and computer science specifically it can
00:13 - introduce reinforce or extend any
00:17 - student learning related to marine life
00:19 - if you're teaching about ecosystems
00:21 - sustainability or the food chain or just
00:25 - want to get your students coding you've
00:26 - come to the right
00:28 - place
00:32 - in this module students will simulate a
00:33 - marine life ecosystem and code several
00:36 - sustainable fishing practices the main
00:39 - computer science Concepts in this module
00:41 - are events and conditionals in coding
00:44 - there are cause and effects
00:45 - relationships we trigger with events an
00:48 - event is an action that tells a specific
00:50 - chunk of code to run for example you can
00:53 - use events to make the boat catch the
00:55 - fish Sprites or to make the boat
00:58 - disappear from the screen after after a
01:00 - certain number of seconds events make
01:02 - your code more Dynamic each time you run
01:05 - the simulation you will have a slightly
01:07 - different
01:08 - outcome conditionals cause something to
01:11 - happen if a condition is true for
01:13 - example if there is too much algae the
01:16 - coral becomes sick or if there is too
01:19 - little algae the fish have no food
01:21 - source and leave the
01:26 - area there are three lessons in this
01:29 - module in lesson one students will
01:31 - program a model of an aquatic ecosystem
01:34 - and then simulate an overfishing
01:36 - situation students will learn how to
01:38 - program conditional statements to check
01:40 - the amount of algae in the
01:45 - water in lesson two students will read
01:48 - about and then program three different
01:50 - solutions to the problem of overfishing
01:53 - first students will modify the behavior
01:55 - of the boat so it can only move within a
01:57 - specified fishing Zone
02:01 - second students will program a new event
02:04 - to specify a fishing season and a no
02:07 - fishing
02:13 - season third students will learn how to
02:16 - use a variable to keep track of the
02:18 - number of fish the boat has removed in
02:20 - order to enforce a fishing
02:26 - limit in the final lesson students will
02:29 - EXP explor several different ecosystem
02:32 - simulations students can choose to
02:34 - explore a rainforest desert Arctic or
02:38 - Wetlands ecosystem they will take on the
02:41 - role of an ecologist and investigate the
02:44 - interactions between the plants and
02:46 - animals in order to rebalance each
02:53 - ecosystem often students try to snap a
02:56 - green event block under the when run
02:58 - block but this will not work the event
03:01 - block stands on its own and any code
03:03 - added to it will run when the event is
03:05 - triggered to test students will need to
03:08 - press run trigger the event they coded
03:11 - and make sure it's working
03:16 - correctly when adding conditional blocks
03:18 - to their code students need to make sure
03:21 - to put a block of code inside the
03:23 - conditional statement remember a
03:25 - conditional represents an if then
03:28 - statement if the condition is true then
03:31 - the program will run the code inside the
03:33 - conditional block because the simulation
03:36 - changes each time sometimes the students
03:39 - will need to run their code multiple
03:41 - times in order for the condition to
03:43 - become
03:49 - true in every lesson plan discussion
03:52 - questions are coupled with discussion
03:54 - goals check for understanding and
03:56 - promote student Reflection by
03:57 - incorporating these discussion questions
03:59 - into into your
04:03 - teaching this module is aligned with
04:06 - ngss and the computer science Teachers
04:09 - Association standards in order to align
04:12 - to the concepts you already teach to
04:14 - help me think of ways to integrate ask
04:16 - yourself how might this module support
04:18 - the content I am already teaching and
04:21 - should I use this module to introduce
04:24 - reinforce or extend student learning on
04:26 - this
04:28 - topic
04:31 - don't forget about the hide and show
04:33 - feature for each lesson it's best
04:35 - practice to only show the lesson
04:37 - students are currently working on if you
04:40 - do not hide the following lessons
04:42 - students will be moved to the next
04:44 - lesson
04:48 - automatically before teaching the module
04:50 - complete each coding level on your own
04:53 - you can write your own code as an
04:54 - example for students make sure to review
04:57 - the lesson plans and additional
04:58 - resources
05:00 - code.org provides resources like slides
05:03 - student handouts and helpful hints to
05:05 - help you and your students get
