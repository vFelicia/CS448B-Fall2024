00:10 - hi i'm jessica i'm a software engineer
00:12 - at code.org hi i'm judy and i'm a
00:14 - software engineer at snap acceptance
00:16 - testing is making sure that the
00:20 - code that's been written and the feature
00:23 - that's been built is at a quality that
00:25 - is good for the user we never fully roll
00:28 - out a product unless it has been fully
00:30 - tested out first you never want your
00:31 - users to be the first people to test
00:33 - your code
00:35 - because it will be broken you write some
00:37 - code
00:38 - and you know the ins and outs of it and
00:40 - then the next day someone else comes in
00:43 - and looks at your code and adjusts it or
00:46 - makes something new without tests
00:47 - there's a very good chance that they
00:49 - will unintentionally break something
00:51 - that you wrote testing is a continuous
00:53 - process we do vigorous testing we have
00:56 - to make sure that it does what it's
00:57 - supposed to do and so every single day
00:59 - this code gets deployed to a test
01:01 - environment which is
01:03 - a clone of our production environment
01:05 - once the project is ready to get tested
01:08 - we make sure we announce that to our
01:10 - quality assurance engineers qa engineers
01:13 - are also software engineers but they
01:15 - focus more on quality assurance that's
01:17 - what qa stands for testing is done in a
01:19 - group it's a very collaborative
01:20 - environment the good thing about sharing
01:22 - that around to a bunch of different
01:24 - people is now a lot of different people
01:25 - know the way it's supposed to work how
01:27 - we decide on what to test is basically
01:29 - engineers work with product manager
01:31 - closely to make sure all the
01:33 - requirements are defined test cases are
01:35 - defined so that lqa engineers can follow
01:38 - finding a bug is you know really a
01:41 - process of searching something breaks
01:43 - someone will notice it'll affect
01:44 - someone's day we really have to give it
01:46 - up to our qa teams though because
01:48 - they're the ones who are literally
01:50 - testing every single day to ensure that
01:52 - our product remain at the highest
01:54 - quality that it can be there's this
01:57 - piece called beta testing as well we
01:59 - have an idea of something that we want
02:02 - to build and there's a set of people who
02:05 - are going to try it out first who didn't
02:07 - work on building it who don't know it so
02:10 - well as we do in that test sessions
02:12 - we're involved are usually the engineers
02:13 - building the products so they can answer
02:15 - any questions people who are testing
02:17 - have testing allows us to detect a lot
02:19 - of things like are the business
02:20 - requirements meant do we have good
02:22 - performance is it secure do we handle
02:26 - data correctly it's the only way to
02:28 - ensure a customer and users happiness if
02:31 - you didn't test everything would be
02:33 - broken all the time
