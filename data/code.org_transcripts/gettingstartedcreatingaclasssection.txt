00:04 - Hi! My name is Bryan, and i'm part of the 
product management team here at Code.org.  
00:10 - In this video, I'll show you how to create a classroom section. 
00:13 - Classroom sections are how you manage and organize your students, assign work to your class, and track student progress.
00:20 - We recommend that you create one classroom section, for each class or period that you teach.
00:25 - Let's get started! After logging in, you'll land on the home page called "My Dashboard".
00:31 - Start by clicking on the "Create a section" button. 
00:35 - You choose how students in your section log in to Code.org.
00:39 - Different login types accommodate 
various student ages and abilities.
00:43 - If you use Google Classroom or Clever to 
manage your section, you can easily sync  
00:47 - your class roster to a Code.org section, and 
your students will log in via Google or Clever.
00:52 - Your account must be linked to Google or Clever
to see these options.
00:56 - For both "picture" and "secret word" login types you'll create accounts for your students.
01:01 - The "picture password" login type uses a picture as a password, while the "secret words" login type uses two random words that are easy to remember.
01:10 - For the "personal email login" type, students will create their own accounts using an email address they have access to, and a password they come up with.
01:19 - After choosing a login type, you'll be asked to add some details to your new section. 
01:28 - Don't worry, you can always change these details later.
01:32 - Once you're finished, click the "Save" button to finish creating your section. 
01:37 - You'll see your newly created section at the top of your list of class sections, along with the section code.
01:44 - If you selected picture password or secret word logins, click the "Add Students" button to add students to your class.
01:52 - You can add students one by one,
01:57 - or add multiple students by clicking on the button that says "Add Multiple Students"
02:10 - Next, let's talk about how students will log into Code.org.
02:16 - You can print login cards with login instructions for each student, by clicking on the "Print login cards" button at the top of the "Manage Students" tab
02:23 - Or, you can click on the option menu, next to each student's name, to print an individual card for them. 
02:33 - For Google Classroom, students will click on the sign in button, 
02:37 - and then the "Continue with Google" button.
02:43 - For Clever, students must log into their Clever account, then click on the Code.org widget on their class page.
02:52 - To sign in with picture passwords or secret 
words, students will click on the sign in button ,
02:59 - enter your section's six letter code in the section code box, 
03:05 - then select their name from the list of names.
03:08 - Then enter their password either by choosing the picture from the list of pictures,
03:15 - or by entering their two secret words if prompted.
03:21 - For personal email logins, students will create their own accounts  
03:25 - using an email address they have access to,
03:27 - Or, reuse an existing account on code.org if they  have one.
03:32 - At the bottom of "My Dashboard", students will be able to join your section by typing in your section code, then clicking "Join Section".
03:42 - That's it! If you need additional help please, check out our list of support articles, at support.code.org.
