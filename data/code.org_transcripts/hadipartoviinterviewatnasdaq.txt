00:00 - from the Nasdaq market site in Times
00:01 - Square I'm Brad Smith and you're
00:02 - watching behind the Bell
00:03 - now as you may have seen on some of the
00:05 - broadcast networks or perhaps even here
00:07 - on Facebook live
00:08 - code.org rang the opening bell to
00:11 - celebrate hour of code which is
00:13 - officially kicked off and now we're
00:15 - joined by their chief executive officer
00:17 - how do you part Toby to discuss a lot of
00:19 - the great initiatives that are going on
00:20 - around this I did great to have you here
00:22 - thank you so much it was such an
00:23 - exciting morning yeah yeah so we saw you
00:26 - on the broadcast networks here on
00:27 - Facebook live - how was it ringing the
00:29 - opening bell it was such an amazing
00:30 - experience you know I've always seen you
00:32 - know what companies I've invested and
00:34 - I've gone public watching them you know
00:36 - bring the opening bell but the
00:37 - excitement was just palpable it's
00:39 - awesome absolutely now hour of code and
00:41 - code or you're no stranger to the Nasdaq
00:43 - market side as well especially last year
00:46 - when you brought r2d2 who is a very well
00:49 - known figure obviously for any of us
00:52 - so what does co.org an hour of code have
00:55 - in store for this year and and perhaps
00:58 - even before that take us back had an
00:59 - hour of code get it start so you know
01:02 - code.org had the original vision that
01:04 - every student in every school should
01:06 - have the opportunity to learn computer
01:07 - science but you know the challenge with
01:09 - computer science is you don't need to
01:10 - explain to people that technology's
01:12 - changing the world or that there's money
01:14 - in it everybody already knows that you
01:16 - could go anywhere in the country people
01:17 - understand that but people don't realize
01:19 - that I could learn to make an app or my
01:22 - eight-year-old daughter could learn to
01:24 - code or my classroom of kids in New York
01:26 - City can all start learning computer
01:28 - science people just don't imagine that
01:29 - and the idea behind the hour of code is
01:32 - to ask every student in every classroom
01:34 - in the entire world to try just one hour
01:37 - to demystify this field to realize that
01:39 - you can learn this and then once you do
01:41 - the first hour you go well beyond to
01:43 - then decide okay I can actually do this
01:45 - now there's another side of the
01:47 - conversation that would argue shouldn't
01:49 - we let children choose their own
01:50 - passions instead of pushing this on them
01:53 - but but what would you have to say to
01:54 - that
01:54 - I completely agree the data when you
01:57 - actually survey students if you ask them
01:58 - what is what are the classes that they
02:00 - like the most
02:01 - number one is art number two is dance
02:03 - number three is computer science well
02:05 - you would not believe that so yes we
02:07 - should let you students study what they
02:09 - want but the way to do that is to offer
02:11 - computer science in the schools
02:13 - the problem we try to solve is that most
02:14 - schools don't even teach computer
02:16 - science so they're kids who would like
02:17 - to learn it don't have a chance and then
02:19 - the other thing is if they don't ever
02:20 - get a taste of it they won't even know
02:23 - if they like it and an hour of code is
02:25 - enough to give you that taste to give
02:26 - you get you hooked so what what exactly
02:28 - can we learn in just one hour then the
02:30 - the most important thing you learn in
02:32 - one hour is that this is more fun than
02:34 - you thought and easier than you thought
02:35 - and that you'd like to learn more that's
02:37 - that's the most important thing but in
02:39 - terms of actual technical concept so you
02:41 - can learn the idea of a repeat loop that
02:43 - you can have a bunch of commands in and
02:45 - then say I want this to repeat a
02:46 - thousand times and how quickly you can
02:48 - do a computer can do a lot more than one
02:51 - thing at a time you know that's a simple
02:53 - type of a technical concept that you can
02:54 - learn easily with an hour of code
02:55 - absolutely now before we started we were
02:57 - actually discussing you know exactly
02:59 - what kind of systems they're using to
03:01 - learn how to code and and they you know
03:04 - giving my own personal example you know
03:06 - the reason why I got my first job was
03:08 - because I had made my own website and I
03:10 - had kind of dropped in different pieces
03:12 - of open source code and information to
03:15 - be able to really make it my own and
03:18 - customize it and that in that sense so
03:20 - how exactly are kids learning this day
03:22 - these days or is it through you know a
03:24 - WYSIWYG or you know what's what's this
03:26 - bar for younger kids the most popular
03:28 - way of learning is with block based
03:30 - coding okay and in fact the code.org
03:32 - tutorial system our our website actually
03:34 - has a full coding environment Wow that
03:36 - is by far the most popular learning
03:38 - environment for computer science right
03:39 - now it's literally used by a hundred
03:42 - million students globally one out of ten
03:44 - students in the entire planet has used
03:46 - code org to learn basic block based
03:48 - coding now can America's public schools
03:51 - teach coding as well how do we roll that
03:54 - out that's a great question because when
03:56 - I started three years ago people just
03:57 - said no they said don't even bother
03:59 - trying to get public schools to teach
04:01 - this they always said do an after school
04:02 - thing or a summer thing and I just
04:05 - thought that just is gonna leave half
04:07 - the country or more than half the
04:08 - country behind you know we have a
04:09 - trillion dollar system called the
04:12 - American public school system every kid
04:14 - goes through it that school system can
04:16 - change and the last three years we've
04:18 - got a hundred of the largest districts
04:20 - in the country as well as many states
04:22 - that say we're going to teach us in
04:23 - public schools so New York City Oakland
04:26 - Chicago
04:27 - Los Angeles all of these cities have
04:29 - said every school must teach computer
04:31 - science and that's completely just gonna
04:33 - change the nature of who gets into tech
04:35 - so now thinking in the broader education
04:38 - system as well you know President Obama
04:39 - was obviously a huge supporter for
04:42 - advancing technology and computer
04:44 - science education within the K through
04:46 - 12 academic curriculum so with the new
04:51 - administration coming in what what I'm
04:53 - interested in knowing is how do we think
04:54 - that'll shake things up or perhaps move
04:56 - it forward hopefully so I actually think
04:59 - what we're doing is more important now
05:01 - than ever before what we learned in this
05:03 - election is that Americans demand
05:05 - opportunity whether you're an urban you
05:08 - know kid living in a neighborhood in New
05:10 - York City or Chicago or whether you're
05:12 - part of the working class in a rural
05:14 - region Americans just feel like the
05:16 - system isn't repaying hard work and now
05:19 - I don't think manufacturing jobs are
05:21 - gonna be coming back quite the way we'd
05:23 - like not because they're gonna stay in
05:24 - China but because they're gonna get
05:25 - automated we're living in a world where
05:27 - computers are gonna automate
05:29 - manufacturing jobs they're gonna
05:30 - automate truck driving jobs and I think
05:33 - even works of work in medicine is gonna
05:35 - be increasingly automated there's
05:37 - already computers that can detect cancer
05:39 - better than a doctor can so as a lot of
05:41 - the work that we do gets automated
05:43 - where's the growth in the economy it's
05:45 - in computing and computer science right
05:46 - now the currently open jobs in computing
05:49 - fields are the largest slice of new
05:52 - wages in the country so we already have
05:54 - the jobs we just need to train people to
05:56 - go into them so getting back to the new
05:58 - administration this is the best way for
06:01 - the new administration to help fix the
06:02 - economy and and Donald Trump's
06:05 - hundred-day plan has already mentioned
06:06 - technology education and he's got like a
06:08 - two-sentence is about education but
06:10 - technology is part of that so I think
06:12 - I'm looking forward to seeing what kind
06:13 - of support that certainly and even more
06:15 - over with the sectors that it impacts
06:17 - one that we don't think about all the
06:19 - time agriculture and you see companies
06:21 - like blue apron that are rolling out and
06:23 - using technology to better facilitate
06:25 - how they're tracking things in their
06:27 - warehouse is to actually facilitating a
06:29 - service where they're making sure the
06:32 - food is getting fresh from farm-to-table
06:34 - and losers are able to do that yeah we
06:37 - hear about self-driving cars or
06:38 - self-driving trucks already right now
06:41 - and
06:41 - Fields John Deere has self-driving
06:43 - tractors Wow
06:44 - you know self-driving tractors are much
06:46 - there's nothing you can bump into you're
06:48 - not gonna run into humans or you know
06:50 - there's not it's on a freeway so it's on
06:52 - a giant field but these aren't sort of
06:53 - just an idea in the lab they're actually
06:55 - out in the field today which means the
06:57 - farmers that are managing those
06:58 - self-driving tractors are actually
06:59 - coding on a tablet what the tractors
07:02 - supposed to do and they're actually
07:03 - giving it commands a lot like the block
07:05 - based coding that we do with kids had
07:07 - and that's gonna change agriculture
07:09 - there's not a single field there's not a
07:11 - single career not a single area of
07:13 - academic study that's not getting
07:14 - disrupted by computing computer science
07:16 - certainly so if I'm a parent how do I
07:18 - become an advocate for this and make
07:20 - sure that I can get involved the most
07:22 - important thing any parent can do is go
07:24 - to your school your kids school and say
07:26 - please teach computer science and coding
07:28 - that's the most important thing you
07:29 - might think I want to find a summer camp
07:32 - for them or an after school thing like
07:33 - real school should be teaching this and
07:35 - of course then if the school doesn't you
07:37 - can try to find an after school activity
07:39 - and if you go to code org we both have
07:42 - online courses we also have a whole map
07:44 - where you can find workshops or summer
07:46 - camps but to advocate for your school to
07:48 - teach computer science that's the most
07:50 - important thing now horse who are some
07:51 - of the figures that have gotten involved
07:53 - this year because we were talking about
07:55 - some of them before and it's quite
07:56 - amazing so could you share with the
07:59 - Facebook audience sure you know we've
08:01 - always had the good fortune of having
08:03 - you know amazing people support what
08:06 - we're doing cuz it's such a good idea so
08:08 - you know we started off with Mark
08:09 - Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and Jack
08:10 - Dorsey saying this is important then
08:12 - President Obama joined it and said and
08:14 - then that not just the president
08:15 - Republicans Democrats celebrities this
08:18 - year our theme has been athletes so
08:20 - we've had Serena Williams Kobe Bryant
08:22 - Neymar Marcelo and Sergio Ramos from
08:25 - Spain
08:26 - draymond Green Carmelo Anthony Sue Bird
08:29 - Alana beard a whole cast of characters
08:31 - from the NBA it's been amazing having
08:33 - these athletes do this and if you
08:35 - actually look at their Facebook pages
08:36 - Neymar actually just posted this video
08:38 - we put out of all these athletes
08:40 - together encouraging kids to be all that
08:43 - they can be in to push themselves to
08:44 - learn computer science and just before
08:46 - we wrap the the brandy fills here at
08:48 - Nasdaq is that of ambition coupled with
08:50 - tagline a nitro ambition what piece of
08:52 - advice would you have for the next
08:54 - generation of perhaps
08:55 - ambitious coders out there well you know
08:58 - our vision aligns really well with the
09:01 - Nasdaq vision because if you have this
09:03 - ambitious vision of something you want
09:05 - to do the best way to do something big
09:07 - is with coding there's no other field
09:09 - where you could start a company from
09:10 - your bedroom and then suddenly see it
09:12 - expand all around the world
09:14 - that's literally what I've done with the
09:15 - hour of code it started out as a simple
09:16 - idea and it's now worldwide but I would
09:19 - say learn computer science and then
09:21 - stick with it
09:22 - absolutely I did great to have you here
09:24 - after the Nasdaq opening bell and look
09:26 - forward to having hour of code in co.org
09:27 - back many more times in a few thank you
09:30 - so much absolutely and thank you all for
09:31 - watching live on Facebook stay tuned for
09:33 - more coming from the Nasdaq market site
09:35 - throughout the rest of the day
