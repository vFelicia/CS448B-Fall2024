00:00 - for our new high school course where we
00:02 - teach computer science principles
00:04 - code.org has built a new tool called
00:06 - applab it's a webbased programming tool
00:09 - that lets you build mobile apps super
00:11 - quickly and share it to your friends on
00:13 - their phones applab has two main parts
00:16 - design mode where I can build the layout
00:18 - of my app and code mode where I can
00:20 - power the my app with code either in
00:23 - blocks or JavaScript text so I'm going
00:26 - to dive in and show you the different
00:28 - features of applab and what you can do
00:30 - with it so here I've landed in code mode
00:33 - but I'm actually going to switch over to
00:35 - design mode quickly the app I'm going to
00:37 - build is an app that lets you pick your
00:40 - favorite pop star whether it's Lady Gaga
00:42 - or Taylor Swift so in design mode I
00:45 - don't need to know HTML or css and I can
00:48 - get going with my layout I can also
00:50 - choose and upload my custom images and
00:53 - assets so I've designed this background
00:55 - here that I can add to my
00:58 - app
01:01 - and choose that and then I can easily
01:04 - drag and drop uh design elements into my
01:06 - app so this is going to be my drop down
01:08 - where you can
01:09 - pick whether you like Lady Gaga or
01:12 - Taylor Swift
01:17 - better and then I'm also going to have
01:19 - an image here where I show their face
01:22 - depending on what you've picked so again
01:25 - I can just easily upload some new
01:28 - images
01:30 - so I'll start with Lady Gaga because
01:32 - that's what's Chosen and that's the
01:33 - basics of my app so now I'm going to go
01:35 - over to code mode to power
01:37 - it what you're seeing here over in code
01:39 - mode is I've got these blocks arranged
01:41 - in different categories and like a
01:44 - typical block-based programming
01:45 - environment I can just drag these on so
01:48 - this is the on event block so when drop-
01:51 - down one is
01:54 - changed I want to change the face so I
01:57 - can drag and drop this if else in
02:00 - what's super neat is that I can
02:01 - transition over to text if it's easier
02:04 - to type so now if the text of drop down
02:10 - one is Lady Gaga then I want to change
02:13 - the images super neat thing is that I
02:16 - can actually drag these blocks straight
02:18 - into text mode here so depending on what
02:23 - the user picks I want to change the
02:25 - image and I can seamlessly just
02:27 - transition back into code mode and say
02:30 - that I want image one to be Lady Gaga if
02:32 - she's Chosen and I want image one to be
02:34 - Taylor otherwise I don't have my Taylor
02:37 - picture yet so I can just add this
02:42 - quickly and choose her and that's my
02:44 - basic app and let's make sure it
02:48 - runs so I pick Taylor Swift she shows up
02:52 - Lady Gaga perfect so I could share this
02:54 - app right now and I would do that by
02:56 - clicking share up here and I could text
02:58 - my friend the link
03:01 - but I can make this app even more
03:03 - interesting applab has built a
03:05 - lightweight persistent data service so
03:07 - that if I want to store data for my app
03:10 - I can so let's make this a bit more
03:13 - interesting and say that I actually want
03:14 - to send out this app to all my friends
03:16 - and make it a survey where they get to
03:18 - vote whether they like Lady Gaga or
03:19 - Taylor Swift better and then I'm going
03:21 - to analyze the results so to do that I'm
03:24 - going to go back to design mode and I'm
03:26 - going to add a submit button so that
03:28 - after you've made your
03:31 - choice you can submit it and because I'm
03:34 - building a mobile app I can easily add
03:36 - new screens so I'm just going to make a
03:39 - very basic uh thanks for voting
03:42 - screen so just going to change the
03:48 - background add some text here change
03:51 - some of the properties super
03:55 - easily just make this a bit
03:58 - bigger and and there okay so now I want
04:01 - to make sure that I actually write to
04:05 - the database when the person hits submit
04:08 - so similar to what I did for the
04:10 - drop-down I'm going to use the on event
04:13 - block and when button one which is my
04:15 - submit button is
04:17 - clicked I'm going to write to the
04:19 - database so here's the data category and
04:21 - I'm going to use the create record
04:23 - block I'm going to make a new table
04:26 - called see pop stars
04:30 - and I'm going to the name of the column
04:33 - is going to be name and then what do I
04:35 - want to actually send that same get text
04:38 - from the dropdown so that'll either be
04:40 - Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift so I can just
04:42 - say get the text from dropdown one and
04:45 - save it to the database in this format I
04:48 - want the column name to be name and
04:50 - that's it so and then when the record is
04:53 - done being created I want to switch to
04:55 - my thank you for your vote screen so I
04:58 - can come down here in my UI controls and
05:00 - set the
05:01 - screen to screen
05:04 - two so let's check this
05:07 - out so go ahead and
05:10 - run I'll pick Taylor Swift and hit
05:15 - submit so I got the thanks for my vote
05:18 - but I can't see yet whether uh whether
05:21 - that actually stored successfully or not
05:23 - but luckily I can take a peek at what is
05:26 - going on in the database so I'm opening
05:29 - up my data here here's my table pop
05:31 - stars and I can view
05:34 - that and I can see that I've got one row
05:36 - for the Taylor Swift uh the Taylor Swift
05:39 - entry that I made I could go back and
05:41 - run my app
05:43 - again and instead submit Lady
05:46 - Gaga and I can go back to my data
05:49 - refresh
05:50 - that and there's my second entry so you
05:52 - can see how all these will accumulate in
05:55 - the same place and I can do any kind of
05:57 - analysis on that data that I want
06:01 - so I've shown you around the different
06:03 - features of applab uh we're really
06:05 - excited about it and it's getting
06:07 - incorporated into our computer science
06:08 - principles class and we hope you enjoy
06:11 - thanks
