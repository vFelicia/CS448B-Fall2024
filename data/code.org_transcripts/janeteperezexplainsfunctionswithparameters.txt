Anyone can be a programmer.
00:01 - You just have to be a little bit adventurous,
00:03 - be willing to learn, and have a great idea.
00:07 - To explain functions and parameters,
00:10 - I can use the example of when you order food for lunch.
00:13 - So say you're ordering a sandwich and a drink.
00:16 - Well, the parameters would be
00:19 - what flavor of drink you want and what size sandwich do you want.
00:23 - And so in this way,
00:25 - functions in computers take parameters so that
00:28 - you can specify how big a shape is
00:32 - or what color the shape is.
00:35 - What if we want to draw a bunch of triangles and have
00:37 - their lengths be different sizes?
00:39 - Now you can use our function block and input different numbers
00:43 - so that we can draw different sized shapes.
00:45 - If you click the star on the draw triangle function,
00:48 - you can drag input name into input block;
00:51 - and then if you write
00:52 - length in the spot where it says X and press Enter.
00:56 - You'll create a length input for your function.
00:59 - Then click on the star again to close it out.
01:02 - Now, you'll want to click on the variables category
01:06 - and drag the length block into the move
forward block of your function definition.
01:10 - Drag away the old number block and now
you have a function block
01:14 - where you can input the length of the sides of your triangle.
01:18 - This is called a function with parameters.
01:20 - To use it, click on the functions category
01:24 - and drag out your draw triangle with length function.
01:27 - Now you can use the math block to input different numbers
01:30 - to draw triangles of different sizes.
01:33 - Give it a try in soon you'll be a coding ninja.
