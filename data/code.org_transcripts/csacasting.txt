00:10 - let's explore the concept of casting and
00:14 - rounding using shapes
00:16 - casting converts one type of variable
00:19 - into another compatible type
00:22 - we know two different ways to represent
00:25 - number of values in java
00:27 - integers which have no fractional or
00:30 - decimal point
00:32 - and doubles which always have a
00:34 - fractional or decimal point
00:38 - we can convert or cast integers to
00:41 - doubles and vice versa
00:43 - imagine i have a machine to give back
00:46 - exact change to a customer
00:48 - the dollar slot needs to know how many
00:51 - dollars to dispense
00:54 - captain can help us do this
00:57 - to understand what happens when we cast
00:59 - a double to an integer or an integer to
01:02 - a double let's think of integers as
01:05 - values that fit inside of squares and
01:07 - doubles as values that fit in rectangles
01:11 - we can think of casting as transforming
01:14 - a numeric value to fit within a given
01:16 - shape
01:18 - when casting a double into inch the
01:20 - double must transform to fit in a square
01:24 - when casting an int into a double the
01:26 - int must transform to fit in a rectangle
01:31 - for example if we want to cast the
01:33 - integer seven into a double we take the
01:36 - square container in seven and move it
01:38 - into the rectangle
01:40 - when 7 is casted into a double it is now
01:44 - 7.0
01:46 - now what happens when we cast a double
01:48 - into an int
01:50 - we might think that when transforming a
01:53 - double such as
01:55 - 3.99 into an int that it would be
01:58 - rounded to the nearest whole number
02:00 - four
02:01 - but that is not what happens when
02:04 - casting
02:05 - remember
02:06 - when casting from double to int we
02:09 - transform the current rectangle into a
02:11 - square
02:13 - in this case we could transform our
02:15 - rectangle into a square by cutting down
02:18 - the middle and removing the decimal and
02:21 - the decimal numbers behind them
02:24 - now we have a square which is a perfect
02:28 - fit
02:29 - to cast in java we can put the data type
02:32 - we want to cast 2 in parenthesis in
02:35 - front of the value
02:37 - if you are casting from a double to an
02:40 - integer this will truncate or shorten
02:42 - the number to everything before the
02:45 - decimal point
02:47 - back to our cast machine let's use
02:50 - casting to know how many dollar bills
02:52 - the machines have returned
02:54 - testing allows us to do even more
02:57 - interesting things with data in our
02:59 - programs
