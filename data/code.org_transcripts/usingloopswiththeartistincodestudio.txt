00:06 - to help us save some steps when
00:08 - programming our artist

00:12 - stage but they only get us started
00:14 - to loop those same blocks four times to
00:17 - draw the whole square we just drag out
00:19 - the repeat block and put the move
00:21 - forward and turn right blocks inside the
00:23 - repeat block when we hit run the artist
00:25 - will repeat those steps four times and
00:28 - complete the square
