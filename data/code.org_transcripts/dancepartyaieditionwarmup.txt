00:32 - the tools to write software and it's the
00:35 - possibilities are really
00:37 - endless over the next hour you're going
00:40 - to get started with computer science and

00:44 - own dance party we've assembled some hip
00:47 - music and a team of great dancers for
00:49 - you to play
00:50 - with you'll be using blocks of code to
