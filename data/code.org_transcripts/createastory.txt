00:00 - So far you've been making an animation or
a story that does the exact same thing every
00:05 - time you run it. Now you can make an interactive
game that you can actually play. There are
00:12 - some new blocks to try out. There's the "when
arrow" block and the "move actor" block. You
00:17 - can put these blocks together to move the
actors around with the arrow keys. And there
00:22 - are some blocks that do stuff when actors
collide or are clicked.
00:27 - Check them out and have fun!
