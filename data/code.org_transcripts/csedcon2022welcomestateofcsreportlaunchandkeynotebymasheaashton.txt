00:00 - I want to share a few words about our
00:03 - Collective need to reignite the movement
00:05 - for computer science because we've had
00:07 - now three years of a hunkering down
00:10 - through school closures and economic
00:13 - challenges and during the last two years
00:16 - it has not been easy to tell schools
00:18 - that it's time to teach computer science
00:20 - almost anybody doing this work has been
00:22 - like yeah we want to do that but we also
00:25 - need to like figure out how to deal with
00:26 - covet and masks and school closures and
00:29 - zoom and all these other things and that
00:32 - was this new school year begins for all
00:34 - of us that care about the movement for
00:36 - growing computer science in schools one
00:38 - of our top challenges is to make sure
00:40 - administrators leaders School leaders
00:43 - teachers classrooms reignites the
00:46 - interest in teaching computer science in
00:48 - every school and to every child and this
00:51 - is not easy because schools still have
00:53 - so many challenges just trying to reopen
00:56 - dealing with teacher shortages and
00:58 - getting the system back going again
01:01 - I want to talk briefly about something
01:03 - we did this past July that just shows
01:05 - how potent and Powerful the interest in
01:08 - computer science is not only in this
01:10 - country in the United States but in a
01:12 - way that I think has Global resonance
01:15 - back in January the national Governors
01:18 - Association which basically hosts the
01:21 - annual Gathering of the 50 United States
01:24 - Governors decided under the leadership
01:26 - of Arkansas governor ASA Hutchinson to
01:28 - to create a Governor's compact to come
01:31 - together to collectively make a
01:33 - statement in support of computer science
01:34 - and when that happened we had code.org
01:37 - decided if the governors are going to do
01:39 - this we need to bring the private sector
01:41 - as well to get corporate leaders and
01:43 - non-profit leaders to come together with
01:45 - our government leaders to all say that
01:47 - computer science is important for every
01:49 - child and you know I started recruiting
01:52 - folks from the tech companies and so we
01:54 - we eventually and unsurprisingly got the
01:57 - leaders of the largest tech companies
01:59 - whether it's Apple Microsoft Google and
02:01 - Amazon Facebook and many many many other
02:04 - technology companies to all collectively
02:07 - sign a statement but what was most
02:09 - unique was what we came together when
02:11 - this when this finally launched was not
02:14 - only the technology companies but the
02:16 - largest companies in every single sector
02:19 - of Industry whether it's the largest
02:21 - Airlines the largest phone companies
02:24 - coffee companies like Starbucks shoe
02:27 - companies like Nike Walgreens UPS
02:30 - Walmart you name it all came together
02:33 - behind the idea that computer science
02:35 - needs to be part of the curriculum and
02:38 - not only did these employers
02:39 - representing millions and millions of
02:41 - jobs agreed to to come behind this
02:44 - non-profits and non-profit leaders from
02:47 - the College Board to Khan Academy and
02:50 - also the two largest teacher unions in
02:52 - the country came behind the same
02:54 - statement and at
02:57 - and then the next day 50 Governors 45
03:00 - State Governors plus five territories
03:02 - collectively also signed a statement
03:04 - basically saying that in the United
03:06 - States we need to move to a world where
03:09 - computer science is available and every
03:11 - student in every school has the
03:13 - opportunity to learn computer science
03:15 - and this Collective coming together of
03:18 - Business Leaders non-profit leaders
03:20 - government leaders when you sue billion
03:24 - billionaires and unions coming together
03:26 - tech companies who are competitors
03:28 - coming together and groups from every
03:31 - Walk of Life and then Democrat and
03:33 - Republican Governors coming together
03:35 - we showed that computer science is
03:37 - important and we also showed that the
03:40 - United States of America can act United
03:42 - on an issue that is important to our
03:45 - future and what happened is not only did
03:48 - we make this statement every one of
03:50 - these CEOs then tweeted this statement
03:52 - creating a global awareness and all
03:54 - around the world other people said why
03:56 - isn't our country doing this too and
03:59 - this shows that the movement to teach
04:00 - computer science is important and it's
04:02 - important globally it is something we
04:05 - all care about here and as we think
04:07 - about basically the bounce back after
04:09 - the pandemic it's on all of us to share
04:12 - that excitement and to reignite interest
04:14 - in this movement
04:16 - the computer science education movement
04:18 - did not have its best last two years
04:20 - it's been hard because almost everything
04:22 - in education didn't have its best last
04:24 - two years but the rest of this decade
04:26 - are going to be the best years for
04:28 - computer science when we look back at
04:31 - the end of this decade I'm quite
04:32 - confident that we will have reached the
04:34 - points where in the United States every
04:37 - single student has access to computer
04:39 - science in their schools and in Most
04:41 - states it will be mandatory for high
04:43 - school graduation and since there are so
04:45 - many Global computer science leaders
04:47 - here I expect that as we do that in this
04:49 - country many many other countries will
04:51 - be doing the same thing some of them
04:53 - ahead of the United States some of them
04:55 - behind the United States but our goal by
04:57 - the end of this decade should be to have
04:59 - at least 50 countries where every
05:02 - student has access and every student is
05:04 - learning computer science as part of a
05:07 - requirement for high school graduation
05:08 - and so I'm so excited to welcome you
05:11 - here today I I want to let us get along
05:14 - with the agenda we have a packed agenda
05:15 - with some amazing speakers thank you for
05:18 - being here thank you for everything you
05:20 - all do behind this movement for computer
05:22 - science for every student
05:25 - I next want to introduce Lisa Dr Lisa
05:28 - milankovic from Broward County Broward
05:30 - county is the first school district in
05:33 - the United States to adopt computer
05:35 - science in every school and they are the
05:38 - sixth largest District Dr milankovic has
05:41 - been this stem and computer science
05:43 - supervisor and a partner for code.org
05:45 - since our very first year give her a
05:48 - warm Round of Applause and thank you so
05:50 - much
05:57 - I want to welcome you to thank you first
05:59 - of all good morning
06:03 - I am the supervisor of stem and computer
06:04 - science in the applied learning
06:06 - Department with all the other electives
06:08 - but we're more than an elective in
06:11 - computer science and I'll share a little
06:13 - bit of information about that Broward
06:14 - County Public Schools is the nation's
06:17 - sixth largest District
06:19 - and through Partnerships both internal
06:21 - within the district large district and
06:24 - external we have grown computer science
06:26 - from 66 students that took the AP test
06:29 - in 2012.
06:32 - and and very unsuccessful failure of an
06:35 - NSF proposal to try to bring computer
06:37 - science across the whole District
06:39 - to a community-wide culture shift that
06:41 - now supports computer science for all
06:44 - and thanks in part a big part to the
06:47 - partnership in 2013 of code.org coming
06:49 - to our district and kind of saying that
06:52 - they wanted to do everything that the
06:53 - failure of an NSF proposal was going to
06:56 - do and more
06:58 - and then internal collaboration across
07:00 - many departments in Broward schools
07:01 - through CTE and learning departments and
07:05 - I.T and a bunch of different departments
07:07 - have worked on this and our schools
07:09 - itself getting the administration on
07:11 - board
07:12 - and the community with our stem
07:13 - ecosystem and our business Community who
07:16 - volunteers for hour of code and be and
07:19 - along with other days in the classroom
07:21 - and have hackathons and enrichment
07:24 - activities so students know how do they
07:26 - can apply their computer science we have
07:28 - reached thousands of teachers now
07:30 - and their students and I think yesterday
07:32 - when we looked in Tableau we found out
07:34 - that we were reaching more than a
07:35 - hundred thousand students have been
07:37 - reached by our teachers over the years
07:40 - [Applause]
07:44 - and we couldn't do that without the
07:46 - support of code.org and the National
07:48 - Science Foundation in partnership with
07:50 - our research Partners at University of
07:52 - Chicago University of Florida MIT and
07:54 - digital promise and prior support we've
07:57 - received from Google
07:58 - and the current funding from the state
08:00 - of Florida and of course code.org we've
08:02 - been able to sustain and grow computer
08:04 - science beyond what is typically thought
08:05 - of as CS teachers because we're still at
08:08 - a hundred thousand students not reaching
08:10 - all
08:11 - over 266 000 students in our district
08:15 - we have now trained media Specialists
08:17 - music and art and PE teachers to be
08:19 - computer science teachers as well PE
08:21 - teachers are making fitbits out of micro
08:23 - bits and other wearable devices and
08:25 - having fun with it
08:27 - students are creating with computer
08:29 - science social studies teachers ELA
08:31 - teachers are emphasizing sympathy and
08:33 - computer science for social good through
08:35 - learning about artificial intelligence
08:37 - and digital citizenship and why that's
08:39 - important in ethics
08:40 - and we have initial training for over 2
08:44 - 000 teachers we have 14 000 teachers to
08:46 - go
08:48 - so still working on that and now every
08:51 - student has the opportunity to learn and
08:53 - apply computer science to solve problems
08:55 - so we're getting there but we're not
08:57 - quite there yet and we welcome you to
08:59 - Broward County and to Sunny Fort
09:01 - Lauderdale beach and enjoy your time
09:02 - here
09:03 - I want to start with who's at CS edcon
09:09 - we have
09:11 - 350 participants this year
09:15 - this year we have 50 over 50 people from
09:20 - outside the U.S representing
09:23 - 32 countries
09:25 - countries such as Spain Brazil Chile
09:29 - Thailand Kazakhstan Maldives and Myanmar
09:33 - from the U.S we have 48 states
09:35 - represented including 25 from Florida
09:39 - plus DC the U.S Virgin Islands and
09:43 - Puerto Rico and actually I wanted to
09:44 - mention that unfortunately some of our
09:47 - um participants participants from Puerto
09:49 - Rico couldn't attend because obviously
09:51 - the impact of the hurricane uh this
09:54 - session is actually going to be recorded
09:56 - and put on YouTube later so just to our
09:59 - Puerto Rican colleagues you know our
10:01 - hearts are with you we're thinking about
10:02 - you we miss you
10:04 - [Applause]
10:11 - so many people here are involved in
10:14 - leading District regional state or
10:16 - national initiatives what we brought
10:18 - together at CS edcon are really the the
10:20 - movers and shakers All Around the World
10:22 - in terms of Computer Science Education
10:24 - there are over 200 CEOs directors vice
10:27 - presidents principals superintendents
10:30 - and 150 State Education Agency staff
10:33 - local Education Agency staff Regional
10:36 - staff researchers leaders of non-profits
10:39 - and Industry Representatives
10:42 - the most special thing about CS edcon
10:44 - are the people and so I want to start
10:47 - out by talking about some of these
10:49 - people and introducing them they don't
10:51 - know that their pictures are about to
10:53 - show up on these slides
10:55 - so we'll start out with zomira May
10:58 - zamira is an education specialist for

12:02 - a corn is the person to talk to if
12:04 - you're going to be training thousands of
12:06 - teachers over the next couple of years
12:08 - because they've done that in Thailand
12:10 - um in Thailand if you don't know they
12:12 - require computer science every single
12:14 - year every single grade
12:16 - and pecoran had to lead that effort to
12:18 - train all those teachers
12:21 - dimitro zagavrovni is the director
12:24 - general for digital transformation at
12:26 - the Ministry of Education and science of

13:43 - disabilities
13:44 - these are just some of the people I want
13:47 - you to meet as you walk the hallways and
13:50 - the sessions at CS edcon I could go on
13:53 - and on and pick lots of different people
13:54 - but that's why we have a networking
13:56 - session later today as well as a
13:59 - reception this evening
14:01 - I did want to give a special shout out
14:04 - to all of our state superintendents
14:06 - commissioners of Public Instruction and
14:08 - secretaries of Education in attendance
14:10 - today let's give them a round of
14:11 - applause
14:18 - getting 12 State Chiefs on stage for any
14:23 - issue let alone computer science is a
14:26 - very special thing we are delighted to
14:29 - have you all here today
14:31 - now I'd like to introduce you to Sean
14:33 - Roberts code.org vice president of
14:37 - government Affairs Sean
14:43 - thanks
14:45 - thank you Pat and uh welcome to the
14:48 - state of computer science I am so glad
14:51 - that this report is here this year it's
14:53 - really a foundational part of what we do
14:55 - at code.org and we're grateful for the
14:57 - partners we have in supporting us I'm
15:00 - going to actually ask you to do
15:01 - something a little bit different from
15:03 - maybe other talks you're at and please
15:05 - take out your phones
15:06 - um you can take them out uh both because
15:10 - we're going to need them here in just a
15:12 - few moments but also there's like
15:15 - 30 chance I might fall off the end of
15:17 - the stage with the lights here and that
15:19 - would make a great Tick Tock so feel
15:21 - free to take them out for that
15:23 - also as you're taking pictures you know
15:24 - feel free I'll give you a couple poses
15:26 - here to get started this is me making a
15:28 - real Salient point on the state of
15:30 - computer science
15:37 - here's me dealing with a Heckler in the
15:38 - front row
15:40 - [Music]
15:42 - all right
15:46 - um okay as I said uh great to be here
15:48 - great to talk about the state of Cs
15:50 - report uh with you all this year
15:54 - um very glad to have uh the partners we
15:56 - we do we've seen tremendous growth in in
15:59 - state policy in making computer science
16:01 - a requirement for graduation and this
16:04 - year's report addresses some of those
16:05 - early results we've seen and provide
16:07 - some recommendation and guidance around
16:08 - it so I'm going to get into that a
16:10 - little bit before we move on to our
16:11 - co-authors who are also joining me up
16:13 - here but first I want to thank everyone
16:16 - who made this report possible including
16:19 - all of you the work you do in your
16:20 - communities and districts and states
16:22 - the state of computer science is a
16:24 - collaborative effort between us at
16:26 - code.org the computer science Teachers
16:28 - Association and expanding Computing
16:30 - education Pathways this year's report
16:33 - was made possible by cognizant and our
16:35 - supporters of Computer Science Education
16:38 - please give those organizations uh
16:47 - this is the sixth year of the state of
16:49 - Cs report and one of the things we
16:52 - wanted to do is take a step back and
16:54 - reframe the foundational nature of
16:56 - computer science
16:57 - looking back we've come an extremely
16:59 - long way in the past five years so in
17:02 - 2017 just seven states across the U.S
17:06 - had standards for Computer Science
17:08 - Education just seven
17:10 - five years later 43 states have
17:13 - standards for Computer Science Education
17:20 - it's hard to believe and beyond that
17:24 - 27 States now require schools to teach
17:28 - computer science
17:29 - think about that for a second yeah
17:34 - five years ago only seven states even
17:37 - defined computer science
17:39 - now we're at a point where the majority
17:41 - of States think it's so important that
17:43 - it has to be taught in their schools
17:46 - let's take a moment to celebrate that
17:48 - how about a hand for our students
17:49 - parents teachers principals districts
17:52 - and state that have made this possible
17:58 - and let's spread the word about this
18:00 - let's get this going so there's a QR
18:01 - code this is where you can use your
18:03 - phone
18:04 - and if you can scan the code and let's
18:07 - help spread the word about this
18:08 - milestone in the state of Cs report in
18:11 - your communities and nationally
18:13 - so if you have Twitter take out your
18:15 - phone it'll lead you to a tweet that you
18:18 - can retweet and we can let people know
18:20 - that the majority of States now require
18:22 - computer science in their schools
18:25 - if this is possible to achieve in five
18:27 - years so as we talked about you know we
18:29 - had seven states that defined computer
18:31 - science and now we're at the majority of
18:33 - States requiring it in their schools if
18:36 - we could accomplish that in five years
18:38 - I'm really excited to see what the next
18:40 - five years could bring
18:42 - stronger scores and reading and math
18:45 - as we know that computer science
18:47 - correlates with better test scores and
18:49 - reading and Math and Science and dozens
18:52 - of Studies have shown
18:55 - what if every high school student in the
18:57 - country had a fundamental understanding
18:59 - of how the algorithms that influence and
19:02 - are shaping their lives every day are
19:04 - working
19:06 - unfortunately
19:08 - not every student has that opportunity
19:10 - today
19:12 - we have more schools than ever offering
19:14 - computer science courses but is it
19:17 - really Equitable access when only 32
19:19 - percent of our students are young women
19:23 - this trend also continues at the
19:25 - post-secondary level as well
19:27 - more CS degrees are being awarded than
19:29 - ever but women share of those degrees
19:31 - are increasing only incrementally
19:34 - and this continues post-graduation too
19:37 - at the current rate it would take over
19:38 - 100 years for computing jobs to achieve
19:41 - balanced gender representation
19:43 - of course this isn't just about tech
19:45 - jobs it's the foundational nature of
19:47 - computer science that students will need
19:48 - to thrive regardless of their future
19:50 - courses of study or their careers
19:53 - but it starts in our schools certainly
19:55 - and the work you all do
19:58 - what if there was a way we could
19:59 - accelerate that growth
20:01 - well these states have
20:04 - South Carolina Maryland and Mississippi
20:06 - are the only states in the country to
20:09 - have achieved above 40 percent
20:11 - participation by young women in computer
20:13 - science courses
20:21 - how have they done that
20:23 - well you might guess they each have some
20:26 - form of requirement for computer science
20:29 - Maryland and Mississippi have computer
20:31 - science or technology requirements and
20:34 - most of those courses above 90 percent
20:35 - of those courses are computer science
20:38 - South Carolina instituted their
20:40 - graduation requirement and had more
20:42 - young women take a computer science
20:44 - course this year than North Carolina
20:46 - Florida Alabama and Georgia combined
20:49 - they're about the same number of young
20:51 - women taking a computer science course
20:53 - this year in South Carolina than there
20:55 - are in the entire state of Texas Texas
20:58 - is a population of about 30 million
21:00 - South Carolina is about 5 million
21:08 - and what's more is a funny thing
21:10 - happening in South Carolina after the
21:13 - computer science graduation requirement
21:15 - went into effect graduation rates have
21:17 - actually gone up
21:20 - eliminating gender disparities in high
21:22 - school computer science access is no
21:25 - longer a 20-year incremental issue where
21:28 - hopefully we'll make progress and we
21:29 - won't plateau and we'll see small
21:31 - step-by-step progress
21:33 - it's achievable in five years
21:36 - as these states have shown
21:38 - computer science is necessary
21:40 - it engages students and their academics
21:42 - and supports learning in other subjects
21:46 - that's what we want out of graduation
21:48 - requirements
21:50 - and states are recognizing this
21:52 - five states across the country now
21:54 - require students to take computer
21:56 - science for graduation
21:58 - Tennessee Nebraska and Arkansas all pass
22:00 - theirs recently and those states are
22:02 - scheduled to begin implementing over the
22:04 - next few years when they'll join South
22:06 - Carolina and Nevada at a point where
22:09 - every student will learn computer
22:11 - science
22:12 - we'll have more sessions and discussions
22:14 - on this over the next few days to talk
22:16 - about what we've seen in these states
22:18 - we'll hear from some of these states
22:19 - we'll hear from students and their
22:21 - experience and why computer science
22:24 - makes sense as a graduation requirement
22:27 - policy makers Advocates and education
22:30 - leaders have to make this a priority
22:31 - though
22:32 - see computer science is a graduation
22:34 - requirement isn't an ending that's not
22:36 - the end goal like we get there in these
22:38 - states and then we're done as I'm sure
22:40 - these states will tell you
22:42 - but it's a beginning step toward
22:43 - ensuring students have the foundational
22:46 - skills that they'll need
22:48 - it's a responsibility that's up to all
22:50 - of us
22:51 - and of course this isn't possible
22:53 - without teachers in the classroom it
22:55 - being a beginning then it's going to be
22:57 - up to teachers and we're going to rely
22:58 - on teachers to continue to make sure
23:00 - students are getting high quality
23:02 - Computer Science Education instruction
23:03 - that's why we're honored to co-author
23:06 - the report with the computer science
23:08 - Teachers Association so please join me
23:10 - in welcoming one of my fellow co-authors
23:12 - Jake Baskin executive director of the
23:15 - computer science Teachers Association
23:25 - I owe someone a drink tonight
23:29 - um thanks Sean thanks for setting the
23:32 - stage for that and welcoming amount
23:33 - welcoming me on stage and before I jump
23:35 - in I want to just take a second and give
23:37 - a shout out to past csta board member
23:40 - Janice Mack
23:42 - although her term on the board just came
23:44 - to an end in July she's continued to
23:46 - serve our organization by Leading our
23:48 - contributions to this report over the
23:50 - last several months so I just want to
23:52 - say a huge thank you to Janice for all
23:54 - of your work on this report let's give
23:56 - her a round of applause
24:03 - now Sean you've made a pretty compelling
24:06 - case for the impact of States
24:08 - implementing a graduation requirement
24:09 - it's really clear to me from the data
24:12 - that you've shown and what we see in the
24:13 - report that these states have seen a
24:15 - dramatic shift in who takes at least one
24:18 - computer science course and especially a
24:21 - shift in how young women and non-binary
24:23 - students engage in CS
24:25 - but before everyone in this room walks
24:28 - away thinking this is going to be easy
24:30 - I'll just make it CS graduation
24:31 - requirement next year
24:33 - I want to take a moment and recognize
24:35 - that none of these changes would be
24:37 - possible without one key group
24:39 - the amazing computer science teachers
24:41 - that bring these courses to life
24:51 - in fact at csta we know from our reach
24:54 - to the teacher census that among
24:56 - computer science teachers there's strong
24:58 - support for states to enact graduation
25:01 - requirements when implemented
25:03 - thoughtfully and that thoughtfully part
25:05 - is important here
25:07 - from this year's report we know that
25:09 - still only 53 percent of schools offer
25:12 - even one foundational computer science
25:14 - course
25:15 - and just 5.6 percent of students took a
25:18 - computer science course last year
25:21 - in order to make graduation requirements
25:23 - a reality
25:24 - we're going to need to see those numbers
25:25 - change dramatically
25:28 - and states are going to need to get
25:29 - serious about investing in teacher
25:31 - development with an eye towards career
25:34 - long support
25:36 - in fact we've been talking a lot about
25:38 - South Carolina this morning and at csta
25:41 - we're really proud of the work we've
25:43 - done with our South Carolina chapter the
25:46 - Department of Education and the Citadel
25:49 - to support teachers with an annual cspd
25:52 - week event for the past three years
25:54 - where each summer hundreds of teachers
25:56 - have come together to learn not only how
25:59 - to start teaching CS
26:01 - but to continue to deepen their
26:03 - understanding of how to teach equitably
26:05 - and inclusively in the Cs classroom year
26:08 - after year
26:11 - and as everyone in this room begins to
26:13 - plan for things like graduation
26:15 - requirements or other new policies in
26:17 - your state I want you to know that csta
26:20 - is here to help with keyword resources
26:22 - that all policy makers and state
26:25 - department staff should be aware of
26:28 - beyond the work we do directly with
26:30 - teachers in every one of your States
26:32 - we have brought the community together
26:34 - to define the characteristics of high
26:37 - quality Computer Science teaching
26:39 - through the csta standards for CS
26:41 - teachers
26:42 - we have a regularly updated list of
26:44 - accredited professional development
26:46 - providers and opportunities that support
26:48 - teachers in meeting these standards and
26:51 - working towards implementing high
26:53 - quality inclusive and Equitable Computer
26:55 - Science teaching in their classrooms and
26:58 - we verified curricular alignments to the
27:00 - csta standards for K-12 computer science
27:02 - which nearly everyone in this room has
27:04 - used as the base for your own state
27:06 - standards for CS
27:09 - all of these tools are key to ensuring
27:11 - that when CS graduation requirements are
27:14 - implemented
27:15 - they don't become just another computer
27:17 - science class in name only
27:20 - and making sure that your students your
27:21 - teachers are receiving the high quality
27:23 - support that they and their students
27:25 - deserve
27:28 - because at the end of the day as I said
27:30 - to start this teachers are the key to
27:32 - making sure that all students not only
27:34 - have access to but are engaging in and
27:37 - succeeding in a foundational K-12 CS
27:40 - education and I for one cannot wait to
27:43 - welcome the next wave of computer
27:45 - science teachers to our world's largest
27:47 - computer science department
27:49 - so next I'm looking forward to turning
27:52 - it over to Josh Childs from esep to
27:54 - share a little bit more about some
27:55 - specific State policy Trends thanks
27:57 - everyone
27:57 - [Applause]
28:05 - thank you Jake yo someone else to drink
28:09 - uh before I begin talking about uh
28:11 - policy Trends I want to give a special
28:13 - shout out to Dr Carol Fletcher and Sarah
28:16 - Dunn part of our esep team that have
28:19 - helped lead the efforts around producing
28:21 - the reports so thank you to very much
28:22 - for the efforts you did in this
28:27 - so there's a lot to be excited about
28:29 - there's a lot of positivity moving in
28:32 - States and there's some current policy
28:34 - Trends I want to talk about that I think
28:36 - can help lead us over the next few days
28:37 - in an incoming year upcoming year when
28:40 - it comes to Computer Science Education
28:43 - so let's look about back over the last
28:44 - five years
28:46 - since 2017 we've seen increases in
28:48 - things such as state level funding for
28:51 - computer science
28:52 - increases in state plans for K-12
28:55 - computer science
28:56 - and most importantly high schools
28:58 - requiring to provide Computer Science
29:00 - Education in five years the work of
29:04 - State leaders District level leaders
29:06 - Community efforts families have led to
29:09 - these increases that we are seeing
29:11 - across the country today that's
29:13 - something to be excited about but some
29:16 - that deserves a round of applause not
29:17 - now
29:20 - and why I say not now is the work is not
29:23 - done there's more work that needs to
29:26 - that is required and more states that we
29:28 - have to see increase efforts around
29:31 - computer science education and hopefully
29:33 - that will be our goal over the next year
29:35 - and years to come
29:37 - so I want to highlight two states
29:38 - Kentucky for one Kentucky in the house
29:42 - there we go I'm sorry
29:44 - not in the house and Pat's house my
29:46 - apologies and Pat's house
29:48 - so Kentucky centering equity
29:51 - producing uh uh our annual report that
29:55 - measures the Equitable outcomes and
29:57 - participation of students in computer
29:59 - science education to see where they're
30:01 - missing the mark and seeing what needs
30:03 - to be done to provide resources and
30:06 - strategies to see improvements and
30:08 - increases in computer science education
30:09 - participation
30:11 - and then Louisiana Louisiana where you
30:13 - at
30:15 - there we go there we go let the good
30:16 - times roll Louisiana
30:19 - that's Double Down efforts and provided
30:21 - recommendations around professional
30:23 - development of teachers
30:25 - and thinking about ways in which again
30:27 - how do we increase access and
30:29 - participation of our students in
30:31 - computer science education these are
30:33 - just two states that are in the report
30:35 - that you can learn from and see what
30:37 - they've done over the last year to see
30:40 - how they've thought about increasing
30:42 - access and participation pure science
30:46 - and then how do we learn from States
30:47 - like Indiana that have done marvelous
30:50 - jobs around implementation and thinking
30:53 - about ways in which they can get 91 of
30:55 - their students to attend at least a high
30:58 - school attend who attended high school
30:59 - that offers a foundational uh computer
31:02 - science course so how do we learn from
31:04 - one another how do we learn from other
31:07 - states when it comes to improving
31:10 - Computer Science Education
31:13 - even there are important questions that
31:14 - we need to ask as we move forward in
31:16 - this work
31:17 - and so I have four of them here from a
31:20 - cape framework that we've used over the
31:22 - last several years to think about how do
31:23 - we Center and move in Equitable ways so
31:27 - that students all students no matter
31:29 - background
31:31 - no more the family they come from no
31:33 - matter what their communities are that
31:36 - they can also have the opportunities
31:39 - to experience what can come from
31:41 - Computer Science Education questions
31:43 - like do districts in all areas have the
31:45 - resources to offer CS to train and
31:48 - certify teachers
31:49 - and what would that look like
31:52 - RCS courses offered in low-income
31:55 - schools at similar rates to other
31:57 - schools are we doing enough
31:59 - to make sure that everyone has access
32:03 - which subgroups are underrepresented in
32:05 - our CS courses who's missing
32:09 - there are opportunities that exist there
32:11 - and how we flip the narrative not from a
32:13 - deficit perspective of these students
32:15 - but how do we think about the
32:16 - opportunities they provide by attending
32:18 - and being part of our CS classrooms
32:20 - and finally how does the quality
32:23 - instruction differ
32:24 - across subgroups of students and how
32:27 - does that affect learning
32:29 - and speaking from a state level
32:31 - perspective
32:32 - how do we equip and Empower our state
32:35 - leaders invested in our state houses
32:38 - or state Departments of Education to
32:39 - continue to support and dive in and
32:42 - provide resources around CS education
32:45 - there's a lot to be excited about
32:46 - there's also a lot more work to do and I
32:50 - hope you'll join all of us in helping
32:51 - move this work forward thank you
32:56 - thanks
33:00 - please reach out to us if with any
33:03 - questions about the report as you're
33:04 - going through uh thank you for your
33:06 - support of computer science please share
33:08 - the report far and wide hard copies are
33:11 - available if you didn't get one already
33:13 - hard copies are available out by
33:15 - registration so please pick one up if
33:17 - you haven't received one this year's
33:19 - report reflects continued progress in
33:21 - computer science education through the
33:23 - work and support of teachers as we heard
33:26 - from Jake and an advancing State
33:28 - policies as we heard from Josh it also
33:30 - provides us with a sobering reminder of
33:33 - how far we have to go
33:35 - but thanks to the leading States in
33:37 - computer science we know that our shared
33:39 - vision of every student in every school
33:42 - having the opportunity to learn computer
33:44 - science is not wishful thinking decades
33:47 - from now
33:48 - we do however have to act on that
33:50 - opportunity and that time is now thank
33:53 - you all
33:54 - [Applause]
33:57 - I want to introduce to the stage Dr
34:00 - Christina Grant
34:01 - the state superintendent of education
34:04 - for Washington D.C
34:07 - good morning
34:09 - oh we can do better than that good
34:11 - morning
34:13 - too many Educators in the room to not
34:15 - have a good good morning I bring you
34:17 - greetings from the nation's capital
34:19 - Washington DC uh it is I'm geeked out to
34:23 - be here because it is always a joy as a
34:25 - state chief to be able to celebrate one
34:28 - of your schools and
34:30 - um there's an amazing story that I hope
34:32 - you hear more about this school but the
34:34 - joy of my morning is to tell you about
34:36 - one of my students and so Quran Owens
34:40 - has attended D.C public schools his
34:42 - entire life
34:44 - he's an honor roll student he's one of
34:47 - 540 Scholars from Southeast DC who has
34:51 - chosen to enroll in a public charter
34:54 - school digital Pioneers Academy remember
34:57 - that name thunders in the room remember
34:59 - that name
35:01 - anyone who wants to move to DC remember
35:03 - that name but the important part of the
35:07 - school is that is explicitly focused on
35:10 - computer science and computer science
35:12 - education
35:13 - Quran and his classmates are by Design
35:16 - Pioneers they embody the spirit of the
35:20 - school the spirit of our values in
35:22 - Washington DC and they are forging a
35:25 - path for Computer Science Education that
35:28 - will transform their Futures transform
35:30 - our district and transform the world
35:33 - digital Pioneers Academy is
35:35 - unapologetically committed to ensuring
35:39 - our students are prepared for college
35:41 - that they are grounded in high quality
35:43 - instructions in computer science and
35:46 - that they receive an entire whole
35:49 - rounded education for all of their
35:51 - students please join me send him a lot
35:55 - of love this is very hard for adults to
35:57 - do and so one could imagine that he may
36:00 - be a little nervous but please welcome
36:02 - to the stage digital Pioneers Academy's
36:05 - founding scholar Quran Owens
36:11 - you got this
36:14 - [Applause]
36:39 - uh
36:44 - good morning
36:47 - I'm Karan Owens from Southeast
36:49 - Washington DC
36:51 - I'm the oldest of my siblings and love
36:53 - attending digital Pioneers Academy
36:55 - because of the schools Computer Science
36:57 - Focus in our caring teachers I enjoy
36:59 - creating and building and quoting an
37:02 - anime
37:03 - when I graduate from DPA I want to earn
37:06 - a full scholarship to a top 10 school
37:07 - for Esports and prepare for a career as
37:10 - a coder I also want to volunteer as a
37:13 - mentor to Young students in computer
37:14 - science and create virtual reality
37:16 - experiences like Dungeons and Dragons
37:19 - I am very excited to introduce our
37:22 - school founder and leader Michelle
37:23 - Ashton the thing I appreciate most about
37:26 - Miss Ashton is that she really knows me
37:28 - and cares about my growth and happiness
37:30 - I am grateful to go to a school where I
37:33 - feel known loved and respected which is
37:35 - a key part of our culture
37:37 - my experience is that DPA is a school
37:40 - that really lives its values which are
37:42 - accountability growth ownership optimism
37:45 - Innovation and empathy
37:48 - performance as an open Digital Pioneers
37:51 - Academy in 2018 she spent over two
37:53 - decades working to improve Urban
37:55 - education across the country most
37:57 - recently as CEO of the Newark Charter
37:59 - School fund Miss Ashton graduated from
38:02 - William and Mary College and began her
38:04 - career as a special education teacher in
38:07 - my hometown of southeast Washington DC
38:10 - she also understands what it means to be
38:12 - a middle school student firsthand
38:14 - she is the parent of twin sixth graders
38:17 - please welcome my principal Ms Ashton
38:20 - [Applause]
38:23 - Quran a round of applause
38:25 - [Applause]
38:31 - my heart is so warm thank you Quran
38:35 - good morning everyone
38:37 - I am so excited to be here at Cs edcon
38:42 - and to get this opportunity to speak to
38:45 - a room full of Educators and policy
38:48 - leaders who share my passion for
38:51 - computer science and education
38:54 - at my school we send snaps if something
38:57 - I say resonates with you if I start
38:59 - struggling up here you can send me some
39:01 - magic I'll take all the magic all the
39:03 - snaps
39:05 - my journey
39:07 - um to founding a computer science
39:09 - focused School began way back when I was
39:13 - growing up in New Jersey I met my New
39:16 - Jersey people I think they were back
39:17 - here woohoo
39:20 - any Eagles fans Fly Eagles Fly okay okay
39:24 - so I'm focused I'm focused all right
39:26 - so one of the pivotal moments in my life
39:30 - happened in a small conference room at
39:33 - my elementary school
39:36 - the principal had convened a little
39:38 - meeting to share the news that my sister
39:41 - and I had failed the school year
39:44 - and we would need to repeat the grade
39:48 - to this day I remember the look of anger
39:52 - in my mom's eyes
39:55 - this did not happen in third or fourth
39:58 - grade
39:59 - my identical twin sister and I were in
40:04 - kindergarten
40:06 - yes and you won't know anything about
40:10 - kindergarten kids are not supposed to
40:13 - fail kindergarten
40:16 - I must have just colored Outside the
40:18 - Lines or broke all the rules I'm still
40:21 - kind of doing that but anyway
40:23 - failing kindergarten impacted my
40:26 - direction and my career in two very
40:29 - important ways
40:31 - the first is it exposed me to school
40:34 - choice
40:35 - I believe that parents should have a
40:37 - choice and if you look at my resume
40:39 - you'll see that I'm the crazy Charter
40:41 - School person and I want to just tell
40:44 - you right now there are some good
40:46 - charter schools and there are some bad
40:48 - charter schools there are some good
40:50 - traditional public schools and there are
40:52 - some bad traditional Public Schools what
40:55 - I know is our parents want Great Schools
40:58 - regardless of the title and the name
41:01 - but once my mom learned that they plan
41:04 - to hold my sister and I back she
41:07 - searched and worked diligently to until
41:10 - she found another school that would meet
41:12 - our needs my parents knew the school
41:15 - what we were assigned to was not a good
41:18 - fit
41:19 - and they had the agency or maybe the
41:23 - audacity and they knew they had the
41:26 - agency to find something better for
41:28 - their children
41:29 - I believe that every family and every
41:33 - scholar deserves that
41:35 - in Washington DC students have that
41:39 - choice more than half of our students
41:41 - who attend Polk School are either
41:43 - enrolled in a traditional public school
41:45 - or a public charter school for Charter
41:48 - Schools they apply and they are they get
41:51 - in through a lottery
41:53 - every family and every scholar deserves
41:56 - this opportunity
41:59 - the second impact failing kindergarten
42:02 - had on me it is that it is it forever
42:05 - altered the perception I had of myself
42:08 - at an early age I was told that I was
42:12 - not smart
42:13 - a school that creates that feeling in a
42:17 - child is it a school that any child
42:20 - should attend
42:22 - I would never want my own children Duke
42:25 - and Dylan who are twins starting Middle
42:27 - School to have this experience and if it
42:31 - is not acceptable for my kids it is not
42:34 - acceptable for anyone's kids
42:37 - in case you are wondering spoiler alert
42:40 - I turned out okay
42:44 - in fact my sister and I found our way
42:48 - through Elementary School we were
42:50 - successful in school and Athletics we
42:53 - were both the first African-American
42:55 - women soccer players at the College of
42:57 - William and Mary
42:59 - yes
43:03 - she I went on to grad school at William
43:06 - Mary she went on to grad school at
43:08 - Harvard so I think back to that
43:10 - kindergarten teacher I know her name I
43:13 - have a picture I haven't hunted her down
43:14 - yet she just made a mistake we all fail
43:16 - sometimes and in fact I graduated from
43:20 - college and I got my first job as a
43:23 - special education teacher at Ian beers
43:25 - Elementary right in Washington DC
43:29 - but after teaching I spent 15 years
43:32 - working for various roles in leadership
43:34 - all across the country including the CEO
43:36 - of the Newark Charter School fund but my
43:39 - family moved back to Washington DC in
43:43 - 2016 to be closer to family
43:45 - but professionally I wasn't exactly sure
43:48 - what I would do next
43:51 - and this is where computer science
43:53 - enters my life
43:56 - one day I promise you I read one article
44:00 - about how Innovation is changing the
44:03 - world economy in ways that were
44:05 - unimaginable a decade ago this fourth
44:09 - Industrial Revolution based on
44:11 - technological advances in artificial
44:14 - intelligence robotics biotechnology in
44:17 - which transforming how we live and how
44:19 - we work today and how our children live
44:23 - and how they will work in the future
44:25 - in DC I read that there were 10
44:30 - 000 vacancies for High-Tech high-paying
44:33 - jobs in the metro area
44:36 - that would pay a salary of over a
44:38 - hundred thousand dollars
44:41 - that's real money y'all
44:44 - and to put that salary in perspective at
44:47 - our school 98 of our Scholars are
44:51 - eligible for free and reduced lunch
44:53 - to qualify in D.C a family of four has
44:57 - to make less than fifty one thousand
44:59 - dollars
45:01 - these aren't just jobs these are careers
45:04 - and they are careers that can break the
45:07 - cycle of poverty and build generational
45:10 - wealth an opportunity that black and
45:12 - brown families have not had due to years
45:16 - of systemic racism and oppression
45:19 - this realization
45:22 - fundamentally shifted my perspective
45:25 - about the importance of computer science
45:27 - education for students especially for
45:31 - low income and working-class Families I
45:35 - now believe that computer science should
45:39 - be a course that begins as early as
45:42 - Elementary School it's snap if you agree
45:45 - because I think this is the room that
45:46 - agrees
45:47 - it should be a core subject like math
45:51 - and eoa snap if you agree
45:55 - it should be a core class not just an
45:58 - elective snap if you agree
46:01 - it should be a core class not just an
46:05 - after-school program snap if you agree
46:09 - it should be a high school graduation
46:13 - requirement snap if you agree
46:16 - a computer science education should not
46:20 - be for just kids who attend affluent
46:22 - private schools or Suburban schools
46:25 - it should be for all students CS for all
46:32 - for real snap if you agree
46:37 - as in many of our nation cities in DC
46:40 - there is a huge gap between those who
46:43 - are prepared for this rapidly evolving
46:45 - economy and those who are not
46:48 - digital Pioneers Academy operates in one
46:51 - of the most under-resourced communities
46:54 - in Washington DC in Ward 7 and 8. the
46:59 - unemployment rate in these areas was
47:01 - nearly three times the national average
47:04 - in only 1 in 10 adults have attained a
47:08 - college degree
47:11 - I think this is similar for many cities
47:13 - across the country
47:15 - but for me I find myself grappling with
47:18 - this dichotomy
47:20 - incredible career opportunities for
47:23 - young people in our city
47:25 - and many many young people in my city
47:28 - who look like me who are not being
47:31 - adequately educated for these jobs and
47:34 - these opportunities
47:35 - that did not sit well with me at all
47:40 - it actually didn't just sit poorly it
47:43 - felt like a call to action
47:46 - every child in DC should have the
47:50 - opportunity to pursue one of these
47:53 - high-paying high demand jobs and have
47:56 - the schooling to prepare them to excel
47:58 - at one of those jobs
48:00 - so what was I going to do about it
48:04 - I fought back to my own experience my
48:07 - parents were able to find the right
48:08 - school for my sister and I to Excel and
48:11 - to be prepared to do whatever career we
48:15 - hope to pursue
48:17 - every parent should have the ability to
48:21 - do that for their child snap if you
48:23 - agree
48:25 - okay so here I was it was 2017 and the
48:31 - idea for digital Pioneers Academy was
48:33 - born in the months after that I
48:36 - developed a 500 page yes 500 page
48:41 - Charter application that outlined this
48:44 - vision for a computer science immersion
48:47 - school where every child would take
48:50 - computer science and we adopted a
48:52 - curriculum that emphasized computational
48:55 - thinking skills like problem solving
48:58 - collaboration and critical thinking
49:00 - we had this amazing Mission around
49:03 - developing the next generation of
49:06 - innovators but I needed to Define
49:08 - innovation we came up with this
49:11 - innovators think thoughtfully creatively
49:15 - and critically about solving complex
49:18 - problems and this is a complex problems
49:22 - problem and there were three things that
49:25 - we needed to do to figure out how we
49:28 - were going to offer our kids from
49:31 - Southeast Washington DC a rigorous
49:33 - computer science experience
49:36 - Talent curriculum and culture
49:41 - on Talent we needed a strategy to
49:44 - recruit retain and train our best
49:47 - teachers when I developed the idea of
49:50 - DPA at that time there were there were
49:53 - no schools that I could find that
49:55 - required computer science as a core part
49:57 - of the program and a story I always tell
50:01 - is I actually went to csta that's where
50:04 - I met Pat and I was looking for all the
50:07 - computer science teachers I was going to
50:10 - steal them from all of your places I was
50:13 - gonna lure them to to DC to have helped
50:16 - found the school that we were going to
50:18 - change the world
50:20 - and guess what I found
50:22 - a whole bunch of Math teachers science
50:25 - teachers social studies teachers who
50:28 - love computer science and we're teaching
50:29 - and learning computer science along with
50:32 - our Scholars and I thought man
50:35 - this is a real problem
50:38 - and it's a tremendous opportunity
50:42 - the Second Challenge we had was
50:44 - curriculum
50:45 - we had to bag borrow and steal from the
50:49 - best because that's what innovators do
50:52 - so we decided early on that we were not
50:56 - going to be curriculum experts while we
50:58 - navigate the founding of a CS immersion
51:01 - school we would let co.org and code HS
51:04 - and others figure out the curriculum
51:06 - page
51:07 - in fact we decide to partner with
51:10 - Republic in in Tennessee and we use
51:13 - code.org to supplement our Middle School
51:16 - rigorous curriculum
51:18 - Fifth Third piece and this is really
51:21 - important
51:22 - we had to figure out the culture
51:25 - we had to live our values of empathy and
51:29 - growth at DPA when we say growth we mean
51:34 - fat ass
51:36 - play along with me failure and
51:39 - difficulty is opportunity for growth and
51:42 - feedback fat ass that's what we mean
51:46 - you fail a lot in computer science we
51:49 - had to get our Scholars with the right
51:51 - mindset that failing and failing forward
51:54 - is what great computer scientists do our
51:58 - value on empathy was around creating
52:00 - this known love respected community
52:03 - our Scholars had to feel safe to take
52:07 - risks and to share their ideas
52:10 - we are trying to change history and
52:12 - prove that all kids but particularly
52:15 - kids from the most under-resourced parts
52:17 - of our city can be the next generation
52:21 - of innovators that they can change the
52:24 - face of Technology with 83 percent of
52:28 - our Tech Executives being white we have
52:30 - to do more if we are going to change
52:33 - that data our kids have to feel
52:35 - confident they have to feel safe they
52:39 - have to believe that they can be
52:41 - computer scientists you have to create a
52:44 - school that feels that the biggest
52:47 - obstacle to taking computer science then
52:50 - isn't just our teachers teaching
52:52 - computer science it includes this aspect
52:55 - this confidence and this opportunity
52:59 - students have to believe that they can
53:01 - have these jobs
53:03 - this goes for students of color women
53:05 - students in rural communities and
53:08 - under-resourced communities everyone a
53:11 - school that focuses on computer science
53:14 - tries to bridge all of these gaps
53:18 - at the end of the day we believe that
53:21 - DPA is proving that a school like ours
53:25 - should exist for all Scholars but
53:29 - particularly for those who come for our
53:31 - utmost under resource communities okay I
53:35 - have just a couple more points if this
53:37 - is great you can blame Pat if it's bad
53:41 - you can blame Pat too so I'm just going
53:43 - to say this is his house
53:44 - my last point
53:46 - so going back to when I prepared to open
53:49 - DPA I visited various elementary schools
53:52 - to share with students and parents about
53:54 - our school and our mission to develop
53:57 - the next generation of innovators I
54:00 - distinctly remember visiting Ketchum
54:02 - Elementary and meeting Quran and his mom
54:04 - who's here with us today as they were
54:07 - considering yes give a shout out to
54:08 - Quran and his mom
54:13 - I also happy with me two of my Scholars
54:16 - Ms Fields and Jasmine are here as well
54:19 - [Applause]
54:22 - when I talk to them about computer
54:24 - science and coding and Robotics quran's
54:26 - mom said to me this is the perfect
54:29 - school for my son DPA represented a new
54:33 - school choice option for Quran and
54:35 - students in the area one that was
54:38 - focused on computer science had smaller
54:40 - classes and is committed to a culture of
54:43 - every scholar and every staff feeling
54:46 - known loved and respected
54:49 - we opened our doors with 120 scholars in
54:52 - Fall of 2018. our incredible team of
54:56 - Educators and leaders had dedicated
54:58 - themselves to our students and having
55:01 - them be creators in this digital world
55:03 - not just consumers we may have students
55:07 - who will contribute to technology
55:08 - needing to send people to Mars sitting
55:11 - in Miss Harding's class right now
55:14 - I firmly believe that I have Scholars
55:18 - who will become household names
55:21 - founding the next Dell or apple or next
55:25 - Google or the next Tick Tock or SnapChat
55:27 - they are they are at digital Pioneers
55:30 - Academy I believe it I had the faith
55:34 - that these dreams are becoming a reality
55:36 - because I know that providing our
55:39 - Scholars an opportunity that most
55:41 - students in this country unfortunately
55:43 - aren't receiving which is why as a
55:47 - country we have to shift for computer
55:50 - science for all
55:52 - for real
55:54 - the idea of computer science and you
55:57 - won't you guys may agree with this or
55:58 - not but this is what I talk to folks who
56:00 - don't know computer science this is they
56:03 - say it is so daunting but in 2020 as
56:07 - some of the data shared there were only
56:09 - 423 exams that were taken for AP
56:13 - Computer Science in high school students
56:15 - in DC
56:16 - we have 120 students per grade if 100 of
56:22 - our Scholars take the AP Computer
56:24 - Science exam before they leave High
56:26 - School which is our goal we would
56:28 - increase those numbers by 25 percent
56:32 - this goal and this reality is very close
56:36 - we can do it but part of what makes this
56:40 - goal seem so daunting is what people
56:43 - think about computer science instruction
56:46 - they imagine an intensive boot camp
56:48 - coding classes and it feels very Out Of
56:51 - Reach I'm here to tell you that in the
56:54 - Middle School level computer science is
56:57 - very accessible we don't have dedicated
57:00 - computer science teachers at DPA our
57:03 - Math teachers teach math and computer
57:06 - science and they incorporate
57:08 - project-based learning into the concepts
57:10 - of the curriculum the teachers love it
57:13 - and so do our Scholars we start early
57:16 - because it's helpful to think of
57:18 - computer science as a foreign language
57:20 - the malleability of our Scholars young
57:22 - brains means that earlier you introduce
57:25 - the material the stickier it becomes you
57:27 - don't expect students to become fluent
57:29 - in Spanish with just four years of high
57:31 - school Spanish but if you immerse them
57:34 - in it they will when they are young they
57:36 - that's another story entirely
57:39 - and here's a brutal facts in high school
57:42 - it is different we cannot expect our
57:45 - algebra and geometry teachers to teach
57:48 - computer science you need a certified
57:50 - computer science teacher at least
57:52 - someone with industry experience who
57:55 - knows the content and to get real with
57:58 - this group the biggest challenge we face
58:00 - in DPA and not not at DPA but across the
58:04 - country is expanding the number of
58:06 - computer science teachers and as we all
58:09 - know we have a K-12 teacher shortage
58:11 - alone this shortage is even more acute
58:15 - for computer science teachers and at DPA
58:18 - we put out all the stops to recruit the
58:21 - best and brightest to teach computer
58:22 - science I'm at a policy expert but I
58:26 - know this I'll leave the details to you
58:28 - in this audience to figure out how do we
58:31 - get more teachers to teach computer
58:33 - science but you did give me the mic so
58:36 - I'm going to take this opportunity to
58:38 - share a cup couple ideas that I have
58:41 - first we must embark on a national
58:44 - initiative where tech companies lend us
58:48 - their employees in public schools for a
58:51 - year or two if you give me a Google
58:54 - engineer for two years who gets to keep
58:57 - his nice Google salary and I get to turn
59:00 - I I then get to have them teach with our
59:04 - teachers share their knowledge to
59:07 - improve our teacher capacity that would
59:09 - help us
59:10 - second we do need to dedicate more
59:13 - resources to Computer Science Education
59:15 - the federal government state departments
59:17 - and cities need to provide grants to
59:20 - help build the entire Talent pipeline
59:22 - from high school teachers to Tech
59:24 - Teacher prep providers at the school
59:27 - level we have to experiment with signing
59:29 - bonus higher pay and other Financial
59:32 - ways to lower computer science teachers
59:35 - into public schools I think teaching is
59:38 - the world's most fulfilling and
59:40 - meaningful profession but if we are
59:42 - going to compete with tech companies for
59:44 - a small pool of talent we are going to
59:48 - lose and with that here's my last Point
59:50 - hold on
59:51 - before I leave you I want to bring you
59:54 - back to what really matters and that is
59:57 - our students do you have my uh picture
60:00 - perfect
60:01 - and I want to remind you why I believe
60:04 - so strongly in computer science as the
60:07 - ticket to the 21st century indulge me
60:11 - for a minute
60:12 - these are our founders
60:15 - this is our last day of our end of our
60:17 - first year these Scholars are the future
60:21 - of technology they are the future of
60:24 - innovation and right now they are with
60:27 - us today but back at home there's a
60:30 - scholar that you know there's a school
60:32 - that you know there's a community I need
60:34 - you to put them on your shoulder today
60:36 - as you go through this conference
60:39 - because they need you to be bold they
60:41 - need you to dream big and they need you
60:43 - to break all the rules
60:46 - one last question
60:48 - how many of you raise your hand know of
60:52 - Jeff Bezos anybody know of Jeff Bezos oh
60:55 - okay okay I heard that how many of you
60:59 - guys though keep your head raised I
61:00 - can't really see you but I I can hear
61:02 - you uh how many of you guys know Elon
61:05 - Musk anybody okay hands are raised all
61:08 - right all right here we go
61:09 - how many of you have heard of David
61:12 - Stewart
61:14 - anybody
61:16 - no that's exactly what I thought David
61:19 - Stewart is the CEO of worldwide
61:22 - technology and he is the second richest
61:25 - black man in America
61:27 - he was born in poverty in the segregated
61:30 - South and now he is worth
61:33 - six billion I said billion dollars
61:38 - he should be a household name and yet as
61:41 - I just proved he had he wasn't I want
61:44 - students like Quran to become a world
61:47 - last coder I want students like Jasmine
61:49 - to develop advances in space travel I
61:52 - want students like Samaya Ballard to be
61:54 - Forbes 30 under 30. and at digital
61:58 - Pioneers Academy you will find
62:00 - classrooms where teachers are are not
62:02 - they're not speaking at the podium like
62:03 - me I'm thanks for indulging me but in
62:06 - our classrooms you will see teachers
62:07 - serving as coaches and guides and
62:10 - students doing authentic work so on that
62:13 - note I want you all to commit to keeping
62:16 - those Scholars on your shoulder as you
62:19 - network as we have happy hour as we
62:21 - figure out how to make CS for all for
62:24 - real and I want to and challenge you to
62:26 - do two things
62:28 - computer science should be a graduation
62:31 - requirement for all kids snap if you
62:34 - agree
62:37 - and here's my last challenge I bought my
62:40 - Scholars and our parents here we have to
62:42 - have parents as partners in this effort
62:45 - to bring CS for all for real it is a
62:49 - great start I mean I actually can't
62:51 - believe all these State Chiefs are here
62:52 - today you guys literally run the whole
62:54 - country uh it is the idea that you all
62:58 - are here on this topic of Cs you all
63:02 - have such a tremendous opportunity and I
63:05 - challenge you to keep the scholars at
63:07 - your on your shoulder but to network to
63:09 - know that you're not by yourself we can
63:12 - do this see all CS for all for real
63:16 - thank you
63:21 - foreign
63:25 - [Applause]
63:35 - [Applause]
63:40 - thank you for that glimpse into uh a
63:43 - beautiful future that's actually now we
63:45 - hope that there are more schools like
63:47 - digital Pioneers Academy there are more
63:49 - kids like Jasmine and Quran uh more
63:53 - parents like their parents who chose to
63:55 - send their schools to digital Pioneers
63:57 - Academy and obviously more folks like
63:59 - you we have some time for a couple
64:02 - questions we have some mic Runners so if
64:04 - you have a question about like what it
64:06 - looks like for all students to learn
64:08 - computer science year after year after
64:09 - year please ask a question
64:12 - um and unfortunately the lights are
64:15 - right in my eyes
64:16 - uh but uh if our micrunners could put
64:20 - their hands up and yeah and if you have
64:22 - a question you can put your hand up when
64:24 - you when you have when you have a
64:25 - question please just quickly introduce
64:27 - yourself and then ask your question
64:29 - hi Becky ash from Tennessee and what a
64:33 - wonderful idea and culture you've
64:36 - created I wonder if you could
64:39 - um mind read for just a moment with your
64:41 - teachers for us how do you think they
64:44 - would describe their biggest challenge
64:45 - at working at a school like that and
64:48 - what are some of the things that you've
64:49 - done to help them address those
64:52 - great question so let's get let's keep
64:56 - it real
64:57 - running schools and being a teacher is
65:00 - hard work it is hard work pre-pandemic
65:05 - and it is even tougher post pandemic I
65:10 - actually serve as the principal now and
65:12 - I um I ask this question to our teachers
65:14 - all all the time
65:17 - I would I would actually say the biggest
65:19 - challenge
65:21 - um is is ongoing professional
65:23 - development specifically related to CS
65:25 - but our model and this is where I want
65:28 - to dispel some of the myths because at
65:30 - middle school it is way more accessible
65:32 - High School very different our teachers
65:35 - collaborate but what we tell them at the
65:37 - middle school level is its Project based
65:39 - as long as you do the project before the
65:42 - kids you can fail forward with them so
65:44 - it's a learning experience that you
65:46 - don't have to be the expert at and that
65:49 - mentality and mindset are our teachers
65:52 - really really
65:54 - um address and and I think it makes it
65:56 - easier the second thing that makes it
65:58 - easier is they are collaborating
66:00 - um what I have found is that CS teachers
66:03 - doing it by themselves is what makes it
66:06 - really really hard at our Middle School
66:08 - level they collaborate across the grade
66:10 - so it's like wait how did you figure
66:12 - this out I remember our first year a
66:14 - teacher I mean she was running around
66:15 - the building she's like how do I unlock
66:16 - this code and she was so frustrated she
66:18 - went to teachers she actually went to
66:20 - the kids and they figured it out so I
66:22 - think it's the mindset of collaboration
66:25 - not doing it by yourself but teaching is
66:27 - really really hard I think the obstacle
66:30 - for maybe for maybe for others is
66:33 - actually making sure that there is time
66:35 - and space to play these are all like
66:37 - regular teacher challenges time and
66:39 - space to plan and to to collaborate
66:42 - um I think that would that if I if I
66:45 - could uh you know shut the school down
66:46 - for a week and say you have time to
66:48 - collaborate plan and talk to other
66:50 - people that would give our teachers a
66:53 - huge boost of confidence and time and
66:55 - really get them to be excited to teach
66:57 - and tackle the curriculum but you know
66:59 - teaching is hard kids bring all I mean I
67:03 - know this parents send their very best
67:05 - kids to us they they really do
67:08 - and some days it's a lot tougher so I
67:12 - personally don't think teaching computer
67:13 - science is not the challenge just
67:16 - general teaching is a challenge thank
67:18 - you Michelle
67:20 - uh we have time for one more question
67:22 - out there
67:24 - is there another question out there
67:27 - I can't see I just I just see two Bright
67:31 - Lights
67:32 - okay uh right over here okay one more
67:35 - question uh my name is Ben I come from
67:37 - uh Sioux Falls South Dakota
67:39 - and so Upper Midwest right
67:42 - um I'm an informal science educator and
67:44 - so like I go out to the classroom and
67:45 - talk to kids about science but like how
67:48 - do you how do you keep your teachers
67:49 - engaged with that sort of community you
67:51 - said that like a Google engineer should
67:53 - loan you their or Google send an
67:55 - engineer for a couple of years at a time
67:57 - right but how do you keep your teachers
67:58 - engaged with the people that are coding
68:00 - other than watching videos that they
68:02 - might produce for online content
68:05 - so if I hear this right you're saying
68:07 - that they have access but they may not
68:10 - actually feel like authentically engaged
68:14 - and passionate and committed is that
68:15 - right yeah
68:16 - you know I think for us at our school we
68:21 - always always communicate the why
68:24 - um if the why for us is about being
68:27 - Unapologetic college prep and computer
68:30 - science and for us computer science is
68:33 - about we want our Scholars to have the
68:36 - technical skills we want them to create
68:38 - apps in games and websites and do all
68:41 - the things that coders do and we want
68:44 - them to have the computational thinking
68:46 - skills around problem solving
68:49 - communication and collaboration and so I
68:51 - think when you explain for us doing the
68:55 - curriculum doing our work isn't just
68:57 - about okay teach computer science
68:58 - because it's a requirement it's because
69:00 - we want our Scholars to be on the path
69:02 - to College and Career and these are the
69:05 - skills that are really going to break
69:07 - the cycle of poverty they're going to
69:09 - allow our Scholars to be their very best
69:12 - whatever it is and again one more thing
69:14 - I interviewed a hundred high school kids
69:17 - before I opened the school and what they
69:21 - said to me is yeah yeah we hear you on
69:23 - those high paying high demand jobs we
69:25 - want those too but we want to do what we
69:29 - want to do
69:30 - we want to be a doctor a lawyer a
69:34 - veterinarian and so I think for us as
69:37 - Educators we have to explain the why we
69:40 - have to make the connection that these
69:42 - are skills that you are going to need
69:43 - regardless of any passion any career you
69:47 - have and I think for our Educators when
69:50 - you're we are throwing so much at them I
69:52 - mean and I'm I'm guilty of it as well
69:54 - it's like you got to do attendance you
69:56 - got to call the parents you got to do a
69:57 - sunshine heat calls you got to teach
69:58 - computer science I think for us we
70:01 - always want to be grounded in our why we
70:03 - want to listen to to show empathy to be
70:06 - able to support them but at the end of
70:08 - the day it's about being Unapologetic in
70:11 - your why being Unapologetic about what
70:13 - it means for kids and it's not just
70:15 - computer science because it's a high
70:17 - school requirement although it should be
70:18 - it is because we want our kids to have
70:21 - access to College and Career and
70:23 - opportunities let's give a round floss
70:26 - the mache okay thank you that was
70:28 - awesome
