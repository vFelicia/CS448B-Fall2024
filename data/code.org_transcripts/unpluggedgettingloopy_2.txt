00:00 - Unplugged Activity | Getting Loopy
00:06 - Hi! My name is Miral Kobt.
00:09 - I'm the creator of iLuminate.
00:12 - In my work there is something I use in both dances
00:15 - and in programming light suits. And that is... loops!
00:20 - Loops are repeating an action over and over.
00:23 - When you repeat something multiple times, like my actions to keep the hula hoop spinning,
00:28 - I'm performing a loop of that action
00:31 - This is a loop
00:41 - Today we're going to have a dance party. We'll act out loops with a new dance: The Iteration.
00:47 - We're going to learn about loops using a dance.
00:51 - You'll learn a couple of easy steps and then repeat them over and over to complete the dance.
00:56 - Here are the steps you'll need to learn:
00:59 - clap your hands, put your hands behind your head
01:04 - put your hands on your waist, lift your left hand up
01:08 - lift your right hand up
01:11 - Pretty simple, right?
01:12 - Head, waist. Head, waist. Clap clap clap.
01:16 - Do you see how some steps are repeated? Such as clap? That's a loop!
01:22 - We need to do it two more, ready?
01:25 - You will discover that you can shorten the directions by putting some dance steps in loops.
01:30 - Are you ready?
01:31 - Now we're gonna do a belly laugh, ready?
01:38 - We actually do use loops in our dancing
01:41 - The dancers are wearing computers and they're all in the same network
01:44 - So I might loop the lights through the same dancers over and over again
01:48 - So in the loop I might have an iteration, I'll say you wanna go
01:51 - loop through these 6 dancers over and over again and then within the loop
01:55 - you'll want to increase the speed so that
01:56 - you're both looping through the same dancers but you're also increasing
01:59 - the speed of the lights so that it kind of plays a visual trick on the audience.
02:03 - And that's all created through loops.
02:06 - Loops are important in computer science because they make our work shorter and easier.
