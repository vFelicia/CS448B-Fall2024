00:06 - My name is Jordan
and I'm Lakota and Nez Perce.
00:10 - I'm also Hopi and Mojave
00:12 - and I lead a team 
called Global Outsourcing at Pinterest.
00:16 - Now that you've learnt 
how to use Sprite Lab,
00:19 - you're going to want 
to make your program react
00:22 - when someone plays with it.
00:24 - To do that, you're going to use events.
00:28 - An event tells your program 
to listen for something to happen
00:32 - and then react right away.
00:36 - Some examples of events 
are listening for a mouse click,
00:41 - an arrow button or a tap on the screen.
00:46 - Blocks like "when key pressed"
and "at seconds" are called event blocks.
00:54 - The code connected to an event block runs
00:58 - when the appropriate action is detected.
01:02 - For example, here's a program
I started with a wobbling sprite.
01:10 - If I attach another "sprite begins" block
to the app's seconds event,
01:17 - my sprite can begin a new behavior
01:19 - after a certain number 
of seconds have passed.
01:27 - I can also use actions
like the change block
01:30 - with events like 
the "when up arrow pressed" block.
01:39 - Now each time
the user presses their up arrow,
01:43 - my sprite gets bigger.
01:46 - Notice that event blocks 
don't snap into your main program.
01:50 - Instead, they create 
little programs of their own.
01:55 - Remember that behaviors go
until you tell them to stop.
02:02 - If you don't want multiple events 
to combine behaviors,
02:06 - you'll need to use 
one of the stops blocks.
02:15 - Other events you learn will let you make
different things happen
02:18 - when two sprites touch on the screen
02:21 - or when the user clicks a sprite.
02:25 - Using events you can create imaginative
programs and interactive worlds.
02:31 - Give it a try.
