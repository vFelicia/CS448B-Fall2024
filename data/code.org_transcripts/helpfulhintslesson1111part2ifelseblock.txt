00:00 - okay you're almost there i can feel it
00:03 - you already know that you need to move
00:05 - forward to the end of the path and then
00:07 - check to see if there's a flower or a
00:09 - honeycomb underneath the cloud
00:11 - in order to do that you're going to need
00:13 - this if else block if you're at a flower
00:17 - or you know what you can even change
00:19 - this to honeycomb and go the other
00:20 - direction
00:22 - if you're at a honeycomb you'll do
00:24 - what's in this first slot so what do we
00:27 - need to do if we're at a honeycomb
00:29 - that's right make honey
00:31 - else you're going to do what's in this
00:33 - slot so if you're not at a honeycomb
00:36 - that means you're to flower and you need
00:38 - to
00:39 - get nectar
00:40 - that's right
00:42 - so now you're going to move all the way
00:44 - to the end of the path and then you're
00:46 - going to get
00:48 - nectar if there's a flower there
00:51 - you can see that we haven't yet turned
00:53 - right gone to the end of this path this
00:56 - path or this path when all of this is
00:58 - done you'll want to turn right and do it
01:01 - again
01:02 - if you're very clever you'll figure out
01:04 - how to solve this entire problem in nine
01:06 - blocks or less
01:08 - happy coding
