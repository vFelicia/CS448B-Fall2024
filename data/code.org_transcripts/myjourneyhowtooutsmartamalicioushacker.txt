00:06 - hi everyone my name is kylie and i'm
00:08 - super excited to be here with you today
00:10 - i first just want to say thank you to
00:12 - all the classrooms that are tuning in to
00:14 - the my journeys class chat today
00:16 - teachers just a quick reminder that
00:18 - we've enabled live closed captioning for
00:19 - all of our class chats going forward
00:22 - today we're excited to welcome
00:24 - christopher lopez who spends most of his
00:26 - time trying to catch people doing bad
00:28 - things with computers as part of
00:30 - tanium's security operations center team
00:33 - teachers make sure to put your students
00:35 - questions in the chat
00:37 - for the q a and we'll be able to ask
00:40 - chris those questions at the end of the
00:42 - talk
00:43 - now let's start with a fun icebreaker to
00:45 - get us started i was thinking about
00:47 - candy this morning who doesn't want
00:49 - candy for breakfast if i had candy for
00:51 - breakfast it would be a snickers bar
00:54 - chris what about you what would you have
00:56 - for breakfast if you had to choose candy
01:00 - so
01:01 - i was gonna say snickers you complete
01:03 - that for me so i had to think back um i
01:06 - love peanut butter so it's gonna have to
01:08 - be reese's
01:09 - oh gotta love those as well also well
01:11 - can you just start by telling us about
01:13 - your work what exactly is your job title
01:16 - and what do you do
01:17 - yeah uh so my official job title is
01:20 - security analyst i work as you mentioned
01:23 - in a security operations center uh it's
01:26 - just a fancy way of saying a bunch of
01:29 - people that work together to try to find
01:31 - bad things and protect uh company uh so
01:34 - i consider my role to be more aligned
01:37 - with like a computer detective i'm
01:39 - trying to identify or see when something
01:42 - bad happens or maybe try to catch
01:44 - something before something bad happens
01:46 - and then we basically work together my
01:49 - team and i to let people know about
01:51 - what's going on and we analyze things
01:54 - like that
01:55 - that is so cool could you tell me a
01:57 - little more about what your typical day
01:59 - would be like for a computer detective
02:00 - is it like a real detective
02:02 - do things change depending on like your
02:04 - case file or what's happening in the
02:07 - world yeah uh actually let me share my
02:10 - screen here and i'll start with like my
02:12 - battle station so you guys can see you
02:14 - know what it is that i'm trying to do
02:16 - and work with
02:18 - a battle station oh i'm so excited
02:20 - so
02:21 - here is where i spend most of my time is
02:24 - in front of this computer i hope that
02:26 - you are able to see it um i hope i'm
02:29 - sharing right perfect awesome so
02:31 - um a lot of my day is spent right here
02:34 - standing i got a standing desk recently
02:36 - i didn't want to sit down i know a lot
02:38 - of us have dealt with working from home
02:40 - recently and that's something that's
02:41 - helped me um so i spent a lot of time
02:43 - here looking at logs so essentially
02:48 - um what that is is okay perfect example
02:51 - would be uh whenever you log into your
02:53 - computer uh example like windows
02:56 - computer and you type in your password
02:58 - your computer basically writes a note of
03:01 - that somewhere on the computer so it
03:02 - basically says oh christopher lopez
03:05 - logged in at this time you know from
03:08 - this location
03:09 - i spent a lot of my time looking at
03:11 - those records that computers write about
03:14 - stuff that happens and i try to use all
03:17 - of that information to tell a story so i
03:20 - try to translate
03:22 - what a computer is saying about stuff
03:23 - that happened into something that is
03:26 - more understandable and something i can
03:28 - have a conversation with other people
03:30 - about oh so this and this happened at
03:32 - this time which led to this thing occur
03:36 - wow that's i love that uh telling a
03:38 - story i think that's something you see
03:40 - in a lot of computing related jobs i am
03:42 - curious though what is your absolute
03:44 - favorite thing though about being
03:46 - computer detective if you had to pick
03:48 - one thing
03:49 - so
03:50 - solving problems and trying to
03:52 - understand how things work uh so this is
03:55 - an example of where i spend most of my
03:57 - time this is just like a log file um and
04:00 - this is looking at specific logins this
04:02 - is more for like mac like you know apple
04:05 - computers uh but this is where i spend
04:07 - most of my time is looking at how things
04:10 - are written to a computer and like how
04:13 - that stuff looks like i love
04:15 - understanding why something happened the
04:18 - way that it did when it happened and
04:20 - trying to answer those very basic
04:21 - questions that we try to answer to
04:23 - figure out you know what's going on so
04:25 - this is an example of where i'm the
04:27 - happiest is looking at things like this
04:30 - another example would be looking at
04:32 - another set of logs in a different
04:34 - machine and trying to piece together
04:36 - what does this mean and trying to answer
04:39 - the question of is this bad and how can
04:41 - i determine if something is bad
04:44 - and uh yeah so a lot of problem solving
04:48 - nice i'm curious how did you decide to
04:50 - become this computer detective
04:54 - see that's an amazing question uh
04:56 - because it all just worked out honestly
04:59 - i had no idea that i was gonna fall in
05:01 - love with cyber security um i started
05:04 - out you know in i.t so it is more
05:07 - focused on at least what i used to do
05:09 - was more fixing computers and basically
05:13 - making sure that computers are running
05:15 - for a company and making sure that
05:16 - everything is running the way it's
05:17 - supposed to
05:19 - so i started studying security as a
05:21 - hobby i got a lab set up at my house you
05:24 - know with a couple computers that were
05:26 - very old and i just started trying to
05:28 - understand like how things work and what
05:31 - ended up happening was and lucky for me
05:33 - um i ended up talking to the right
05:35 - people that led me in the right
05:37 - direction of like hey you can actually
05:39 - have a career with that hobby and i had
05:42 - no idea that those two things can
05:44 - actually coexist like that uh so it
05:47 - ended up working out perfect for me
05:50 - nice could you tell me a little bit
05:52 - about why cyber security is important
05:54 - and perhaps how it affects your
05:56 - community
05:57 - yeah um so to me cyber security is
06:00 - important because a lot of people that
06:02 - are in my role specifically as analysts
06:04 - that are helping companies try to solve
06:07 - computer related problems is everyone
06:10 - benefits from computers being more
06:12 - secure or networks being more secure and
06:15 - that's basically what we try to do so in
06:17 - my job as i mentioned earlier we try to
06:20 - let our leadership know so like our
06:22 - managers and their managers know about
06:24 - things that we discover which then leads
06:26 - to a change in the company potentially
06:29 - uh which ends up anyone that uses a
06:31 - service that is you know created by us
06:34 - or created by another team it's safer to
06:37 - use
06:38 - that's awesome i am so glad there's
06:40 - people like you making the internet
06:41 - safer
06:43 - and our computers itself i am also kind
06:45 - of curious what skills or abilities does
06:48 - your work require is that something you
06:50 - had to build up before you took this job
06:52 - or is it something you built on the job
06:54 - so
06:56 - to me the most important skill that
06:59 - every human being has because this is
07:00 - like innate in the way that we are is
07:03 - curiosity just being curious about stuff
07:06 - i spend so much of my time just trying
07:09 - to answer the question of why like why
07:11 - is this the way that it is so that led
07:14 - me to security it works out perfectly
07:16 - because i was like why does this like
07:19 - hack or whatever you want to say why
07:20 - does this thing work that way like how
07:22 - is a computer able to be taken advantage
07:25 - of by someone that's malicious or trying
07:28 - to do something bad like how does that
07:29 - look and how can we look and find things
07:33 - like that so curiosity to me is one of
07:35 - the biggest things and that led
07:37 - perfectly into another skill set that i
07:40 - think is important and that is just
07:42 - trying to understand how computers work
07:44 - like a fundamental understanding of
07:46 - computers and just digging into why
07:48 - certain things happen this a certain way
07:50 - at a certain time is super important and
07:53 - that's all because of uh your own
07:55 - curiosity
07:57 - oh i love that being curious is just
07:59 - such a great skill and ability
08:01 - now i want to do a quick reminder to
08:03 - teachers please use the q a to post any
08:06 - questions you have for chris
08:08 - and now let's jump to the next question
08:10 - which is kind of fun i am really curious
08:12 - about what you do outside of work do you
08:14 - have any hobbies i'd love to hear more
08:17 - ah yeah um when i'm not staring at a
08:20 - computer screen which i love by the way
08:22 - i don't mean that in a bad way um i
08:24 - spend a lot of my time staring at a tv
08:27 - stream because i love playing video
08:29 - games so there's that uh i have a 10
08:31 - year old and him and i are constantly
08:33 - playing video games together i can share
08:36 - uh here something really quickly just to
08:38 - kind of showcase uh you know where i
08:41 - spent a lot of my time
08:43 - outside of work
08:44 - uh here we go let me do that
08:47 - so this is my second battle station in
08:49 - my opinion this is where i spent a lot
08:52 - of my time playing games with my son i
08:54 - mean right now we're playing like the
08:55 - latest pokemon game together uh pokemon
08:57 - legends is fantastic i love it um and
09:00 - this is something that i use to you know
09:03 - uh wind down after working even though i
09:06 - love what i do
09:09 - another example
09:10 - yeah um also i really love to run
09:14 - and be outside you know we spend a lot
09:15 - of time with technology
09:17 - especially now and luckily i actually
09:20 - ran
09:21 - a race with my son recently he joined me
09:23 - and since i live in orlando
09:26 - i get to go to all the really cool theme
09:28 - parks here uh and here goes an example
09:30 - of that running and taking my son to you
09:33 - know to universal because harry potter
09:35 - is amazing and uh we get to do that
09:38 - together
09:42 - dang i'm jealous i want to go to a theme
09:44 - park right now let's all go we can get
09:47 - on a plane right
09:48 - yeah awesome well i'm curious chris when
09:51 - you talked earlier about your job
09:54 - how do you work with other people you
09:56 - talked about you know looking at the
09:57 - logs like do you have to have meetings
09:59 - to discuss your findings what do other
10:01 - people in cyber security do yeah so
10:05 - that's the beauty of this field in my
10:07 - opinion and that's it's such a vast
10:10 - field there's so many different things
10:12 - that people can do i for example am not
10:15 - really a developer or someone that
10:17 - writes code on a day-to-day basis but i
10:20 - work
10:21 - all the time with another team that's
10:23 - basically part of the security team
10:26 - as engineers and they help build the
10:28 - tools that our team uses in order to
10:32 - investigate things which is super cool
10:34 - and if someone really enjoys coding i
10:36 - mean that is such an amazing field to
10:38 - get into because it's part of security
10:40 - you're just building a really awesome
10:42 - things and new things
10:46 - that is so awesome i actually got a cool
10:48 - question from mrs carr's classroom
10:51 - going back to your hobbies what video
10:53 - games do you play i know you mentioned
10:54 - pokemon but what other video games do
10:56 - you and your son play
10:58 - so
10:59 - we have been spending a lot of time
11:01 - recently playing a lot of old games
11:04 - uh i'm trying to get him into a lot of
11:07 - the collection that's on the switch
11:09 - right now for uh the snes the super
11:13 - nintendo uh so we've just finished uh
11:16 - metroid like a really old game yeah
11:18 - fantastic i love it uh and it's actually
11:21 - really hard more difficult than i
11:22 - remember i think we're getting a little
11:24 - bit lazy with our games now everything
11:26 - is so helpful uh with games and yeah
11:29 - another one uh that came out recently
11:31 - i've been playing a lot of halo
11:33 - multiplayer i know that's more for like
11:35 - older uh you know people but it's been
11:37 - fantastic uh so there's been a lot of
11:39 - that recently that's fun maybe some of
11:41 - the teachers play halo and some of the
11:43 - students might be older you might be
11:45 - playing halo hey there you go who knows
11:47 - awesome well i have another classroom
11:50 - question from carlin's class they want
11:52 - to know how do you actually stop the
11:54 - hackers or the hacks from happening i
11:56 - know you talked a little bit about
11:58 - finding kind of the breadcrumbs
12:00 - in the logs and such but is there
12:02 - anything you could do to prevent it from
12:04 - happening or is that what you were
12:05 - saying the engineers do
12:07 - yeah so that there's an entire cycle
12:09 - with how that works so first you need to
12:12 - identify that something is even
12:14 - happening in the first place once you
12:16 - identify meaning you just see that
12:18 - something bad may be happening then you
12:21 - move towards like how do i like contain
12:24 - this like how do i stop this let's say
12:26 - that it's for example like a file a
12:28 - virus that's spreading first thing would
12:30 - be like how do i stop this from
12:32 - spreading right in order to basically
12:34 - stop the quote-unquote the bleeding of
12:36 - that situation and then from there you
12:38 - move towards how do i
12:40 - mitigate this right like meaning how do
12:43 - i fix this from happening in the future
12:45 - right so that's where the preventive
12:48 - cycle comes in like
12:49 - that would be like a lot of things you
12:51 - may hear in the news about like oh
12:52 - there's this new vulnerability right and
12:54 - then you patch that vulnerability like
12:57 - you do an update like you see like how
12:59 - windows for example would be like hey
13:00 - there's a new update uh usually that
13:02 - comes with things that are made to
13:04 - secure that pro that application better
13:08 - so you may patch something for example
13:10 - or you may upgrade something in your
13:12 - environment to prevent that from
13:14 - happening in the future uh so it's a
13:17 - cycle detection containment uh being
13:20 - able to stop hackers is well let me say
13:23 - malicious hackers because i think that
13:25 - there's a
13:26 - sometimes a negative feeling towards the
13:28 - word hacker i consider myself to be a
13:30 - hacker but a good one a lot of people in
13:32 - the field consider themselves to be that
13:33 - too a hacker to me is just someone that
13:35 - likes to understand how something works
13:37 - and likes to see how they can change it
13:39 - to make it work for them in a certain
13:41 - way um so catching and stopping is a
13:44 - little bit difficult
13:46 - because sometimes when you find
13:47 - something this may have occurred months
13:50 - ago or this may have occurred like you
13:52 - know a week ago so you may not have the
13:54 - ability to stop at that moment but you
13:57 - can prevent from there or you can
13:59 - attempt to prevent things from happening
14:02 - yeah that makes a lot of sense and i
14:04 - think that's a great reminder that
14:05 - hacking there's bad hackers and good
14:08 - hackers sometimes called ethical hackers
14:10 - and if you were interested in trying to
14:13 - like solve puzzles and break things
14:15 - computer security is a great field
14:17 - because you can really try to break
14:19 - things as an ethical hacker and then
14:21 - that helps these computers and internet
14:24 - products to become more security
14:26 - hardened so that there's less chance for
14:28 - the bad guys to get in
14:30 - awesome i've got a question here from
14:32 - david higley when did you start your
14:35 - cybersecurity journey i know you talked
14:37 - about how you weren't expecting it um
14:39 - but yeah when did you get started
14:41 - um
14:42 - that's a good question i i feel like i'm
14:44 - getting a little bit older now i got to
14:45 - think back like what year
14:48 - it was but it wasn't right after um you
14:51 - know high school it took a while for me
14:53 - to go to college it wasn't something
14:55 - immediate i went to college when i was
14:58 - probably i think maybe like 22-23 so
15:00 - there was definitely a big gap i didn't
15:02 - get into cyber security until around the
15:05 - time that i was like 25 i was fortunate
15:08 - enough to land into that role
15:10 - without much
15:12 - college behind me
15:15 - nice
15:16 - i've got another question from odyssey
15:18 - charter how can we as users of
15:21 - technology use this type of log analysis
15:23 - to make ourselves safer is that
15:25 - something you can do or would you advise
15:28 - any other tools to make yourself safer
15:30 - using computers in the internet
15:32 - well that's a really good question
15:35 - i'm not sure how
15:37 - log analysis translates to that um i
15:40 - think blog analysis really helps when
15:42 - you're trying to like troubleshoot for
15:44 - example like you're trying to figure out
15:46 - why something is not working the way
15:48 - that it does uh from a more how can that
15:51 - be more secure
15:53 - perspective i'm not sure that that is
15:55 - like i didn't like a direct correlation
15:57 - to that uh personally i mean there's so
16:00 - many uh things out there to try to make
16:02 - you uh safer on the internet um i would
16:04 - say one of the things that i i'm always
16:06 - talking about from like just a general
16:09 - basis uh just given the fact that we
16:12 - leverage we use so many things now that
16:14 - are like you know on the internet uh
16:16 - like whatever it is like we're trying to
16:18 - access like our google account we're
16:20 - trying to access our microsoft account
16:21 - or school account i would say that one
16:24 - of the biggest things that you can do to
16:26 - protect yourself is to use some kind of
16:29 - like password vault protector or
16:31 - something like that
16:32 - somewhere you can store all this stuff i
16:34 - know one password i don't know any other
16:37 - passwords because everything is stored
16:39 - in this place because that's like one of
16:41 - the things that hackers and malicious
16:44 - attackers leverage to be able to access
16:46 - people's things uh unfortunately so
16:48 - that's what i would say from a log
16:50 - perspective i mean i think it's really
16:51 - great like go in there and learn how
16:54 - those things work and it may translate
16:56 - you may find something that's like super
16:57 - cool that you can use to protect
16:59 - yourself better um but yeah i hope that
17:02 - answers the question yeah thanks chris i
17:05 - think that's a great reminder to
17:06 - everyone password managers are fantastic
17:08 - in helping you keep all your passwords
17:10 - super secure and you only have to
17:12 - remember that one password i personally
17:14 - use a password manager and it is so
17:16 - helpful
17:17 - and it makes you feel safer on the
17:18 - internet
17:19 - and going back to those logs i think
17:21 - some of you in the audience might be
17:23 - learning about computer science or maybe
17:25 - even cyber security
17:27 - i am curious what advice you would have
17:29 - for the students out there listening you
17:31 - know so we were talking about logs you
17:33 - might be looking at debug logs for your
17:35 - computer science program there's lots
17:37 - and lots of opportunities for this like
17:39 - cross translation um but yeah what
17:41 - advice would you give to the students
17:42 - out there today listening
17:44 - yeah um advice uh
17:47 - i would say to try to find something in
17:50 - this field if this truly interests you
17:52 - uh find something that you really enjoy
17:55 - to do if that's solving puzzles from a
17:58 - coding perspective right where you enjoy
18:00 - writing code spend all your time
18:03 - learning and master that like that is so
18:05 - cool i didn't have that love i loved the
18:08 - analytical side of things like being
18:10 - able to figure out what's wrong or what
18:13 - happened here and that led me to loving
18:15 - what i do so this is the same thing i
18:17 - tell my son all the time you know he
18:19 - gets interested in things and he's like
18:21 - looking at this video game and he loves
18:23 - it i'm like well why don't you figure
18:24 - out like how that's made
18:26 - um you know how that works use your
18:29 - curiosity to be able to answer those
18:31 - questions of like why did this ball move
18:33 - from this location on screen to this
