00:00 - as you can see i've already coded the
00:02 - program to move forward to the end of
00:04 - the path
00:05 - once we're there we need to figure out
00:07 - how to tell if there's a flower or a
00:10 - honeycomb
00:11 - for that we're going to use the if block
00:15 - if it flower you'll do what's in this
00:17 - top spot what should that be
00:20 - that's right get nectar
00:22 - but if you're not at a flower that means
00:24 - you're at a honeycomb so what should you
00:27 - do
00:28 - that's right make honey
00:31 - now
00:34 - you've got the perfect solution no
00:36 - matter what is hidden in the clouds
00:38 - happy coding
