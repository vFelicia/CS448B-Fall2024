00:08 - who's that you have with you hill piers
00:10 - let's come down a little bit so you can
00:12 - get on the screen so pierce is here say
00:14 - hi pierce hi i'm my name is not pierce
00:21 - today pierce is black panther he is not
00:23 - pierce
00:24 - uh so that's what today is

00:50 - audience
00:51 - okay anybody that's joining tell other
00:53 - people to come on this is going to be
00:55 - the largest live interactive classroom
00:58 - happening and we're going to learn to
00:59 - code together bring your kids bring the
01:02 - family gather around
01:04 - let other people know this is happening
01:06 - and it's live so we now have 600 people
01:09 - in the audience and i'm just going to
01:11 - get started
01:12 - while people are joining so welcome to
01:14 - code break
01:15 - there's a few dozen of us on screen but
01:18 - there's hundreds of more tuning in and
01:20 - about 20 or 30 joining every second
01:23 - uh this is our first time doing
01:24 - something this we're going to find ways
01:26 - for everybody to interact together if
01:28 - you've ever joined zoom meetings and
01:30 - you're looking at this one you don't
01:32 - have all the same tools because there's
01:33 - too many of us to talk at all the same
01:35 - time together we're hoping to build the
01:37 - world's largest live interactive
01:39 - classroom
01:40 - if you enjoy it please invite others to
01:42 - join
01:43 - i'm gonna enjoy i'm gonna invite my
01:45 - daughter sophia to join in
01:48 - hi
01:50 - hi sophia yeah
01:53 - i am sophia i'm 11 years old and i'm in
01:56 - fifth grade let's go fifth grade
02:00 - it's awesome
02:02 - hey pierce what grade are you in pick
02:04 - hey
02:05 - he's a pre pre-k yeah i love projects
02:10 - sound board she's gonna make sound
02:12 - effects for our show so so if you will
02:15 - right now
02:17 - [Music]
02:19 - all right
02:20 - today our special guest is actor and
02:22 - author hill harper who's on screen right
02:24 - now obviously for those of you who are
02:26 - still tuning in welcome
02:27 - uh so hill how are you doing right now
02:29 - how are you handling this whole
02:31 - quarantine situation hey everybody um
02:34 - you
02:34 - know being
02:37 - quarantined or doing self quarantine is
02:39 - is it's been it's been interesting for
02:41 - sure uh one thing that's done is that
02:45 - pierce and i get to spend a lot more
02:46 - time together which is which is which is
02:48 - i think great um and at the same time
02:51 - though you know i just feel for all
02:53 - those people out there and all those uh
02:55 - folks who who are who are actually
02:57 - suffering with with health consequences
02:59 - and just reminding everybody that
03:01 - you know staying at home doing this you
03:04 - you don't see the benefits immediately
03:06 - it's kind of like i guess learning to
03:08 - code in a way right you it's we do this
03:11 - now to reap the benefits for weeks from
03:14 - now months from now and we save lives so
03:17 - so if we can do this together for
03:19 - instance build community online through
03:21 - things like this um hopefully we can
03:23 - establish some measure of learning and
03:25 - normalcy but at the same time reinforce
03:27 - that if a virus can spread so can love
03:30 - and so can support and so can learning
03:32 - in the same exact way and so we can we
03:34 - can represent that here so i'm so
03:35 - excited that so many people are on great
03:38 - excited to have my son here with me and
03:40 - and sophia great to see you and and and
03:44 - uh thanks for organizing this
03:46 - of course
03:48 - we had a corny joke for you hill to get
03:50 - things started where do all the cool
03:51 - mice live
03:53 - where do all the cool my slip pierce
03:54 - where do all the cool mice live do you
03:56 - want to give me an answer right
03:58 - yes

06:11 - headway
06:14 - midway massachusetts
06:16 - all right so for everybody else who's
06:19 - in the live audience there's almost a
06:21 - thousand people already
06:23 - uh click to see if you haven't found it
06:25 - already there's a button like this
06:26 - called chat
06:27 - because we want to hear from all of you
06:29 - as well and
06:34 - you click this button look for the blue
06:36 - button that chooses who you're chatting
06:38 - with and choose all panelists and
06:40 - attendees it's a big blue button
06:43 - and people are asking there's a there's
06:44 - over a thousand people here but what i
06:46 - want everybody who's chatting
06:48 - can you stop for a second and not type
06:51 - for a little bit of seconds so we can
06:52 - then ask a question for everybody to
06:54 - answer what i want to ask is everybody

07:33 - fourth sixth forty fourth grade that's
07:35 - that's a big one fifth fifth dubai yuri
07:39 - what grade five
07:40 - tonight's tenth then fifth first third
07:43 - fourth third third second
07:46 - kindergarten
07:47 - there's so many all right we have one
07:49 - last question we want to get a sense of
07:51 - people's coding capability or computer
07:53 - science capability so everywhere in the
07:55 - chat window if you're a beginner type of
07:58 - one
07:59 - if you're intermediate type of two and
08:01 - if you're relatively advanced as a coder
08:04 - type of three we want to get a sense of
08:05 - how many people here have experienced
08:07 - one computer program
08:10 - two one one two one
08:12 - one one
08:14 - one
08:15 - a lot of ones a lot of twos a lot of uh
08:17 - there's the twenty two very advanced
08:20 - eleven there wow i saw a one thousand
08:23 - we have a one thousand yeah
08:25 - there's a three there's a three out
08:27 - there's a 2.5 wow okay so there's some
08:30 - advanced coders in here there's also
08:32 - some a lot of beginners like me like
08:34 - pierce pierce and i are beginners we're
08:36 - we are minus
08:38 - one minus one all right so for those of
08:42 - you who are calling in from a mobile
08:43 - device whether on a tablet or a phone
08:46 - close the chat now we're gonna let you
08:47 - know when to open up again so we want
08:49 - you all to be able to see the whole
08:50 - screen
08:51 - for those of you who are older or more
08:53 - experienced please stick with us through
08:55 - the end
08:55 - even if you said that you're a three
08:57 - level coder we're always going to start
08:59 - with easier material but we're also then
09:01 - going to get more advanced too by the
09:03 - end of today's code break you should be
09:05 - able to make pretty cool stuff with only
09:07 - a few lines of code let me give you an
09:09 - example of what we're going to learn to
09:10 - do by the end of today
09:13 - with just five lines of code i'm going
09:15 - to share my screen to show you what
09:16 - we're going to make
09:20 - so if you see my screen right now
09:23 - this shows you what we'll be able to
09:25 - create all of the drawings here will be
09:27 - able to do with only five lines of code
09:30 - what do you think sophia
09:33 - sophia is going to do our sound effects
09:35 - she's my daughter here
09:37 - that's that's impressive that is very
09:39 - impressive sofia is our lead coder
09:42 - uh now let's talk a little bit about
09:43 - code break each week we're going to host
09:45 - weekly episodes with special guests like
09:48 - today we have actor and author hilla
09:49 - harper and we're so lucky to have you on
09:50 - board we're going to cover computer
09:52 - science concepts in a fun and
09:54 - collaborative way and then at the end
09:56 - we're going to send
09:58 - challenge questions for folks to do at
10:00 - home so if you haven't signed up already
10:02 - to get the challenge questions you can
10:04 - give us your email address
10:06 - at code.org
10:08 - break or if you just google code break
10:10 - you'll find it we're not going to send
10:12 - any kind of spam marketing messages just
10:14 - just the challenge questions from each
10:16 - week's episode
10:18 - and if you have any questions during
10:20 - today's show you can ask us these
10:22 - questions there's a button for q a
10:25 - if it's a question about what you're
10:26 - seeing or really any kind of computer
10:28 - science question feel free to ask it at
10:30 - any time and then we're going to take a
10:32 - break a few times during the hour to see
10:34 - people's answers
10:36 - the last thing i want to say before we
10:38 - start is this is our first time doing
10:39 - this nobody that i know has ever run an
10:42 - interactive classroom at the scale of a
10:44 - thousand people before uh and certainly
10:46 - we haven't we're we're figuring it out
10:49 - as we go uh and so please bear with us
10:52 - if things break we're gonna learn a very
10:54 - important computer science concept
10:56 - called debugging so if you have the
10:58 - drawing you made of that for this
11:01 - this is a bug sophia drew this bug
11:03 - a bug in computer science is when
11:05 - something breaks and you need to figure
11:06 - out how to fix it so if anything breaks
11:09 - sophia is going to hold up this bug and
11:10 - we'll fix it
11:12 - if my screen goes out always the
11:14 - solution there's always a fix
11:16 - there's always a fix in some classes
11:19 - there's a right and wrong answer and if
11:21 - you get it wrong you're just wrong in
11:22 - computer programming if you get it wrong
11:24 - you can tweak it and improve it and see
11:26 - if you can debug it and so we'll
11:28 - probably going to be doing that a couple
11:29 - of times today
11:31 - so
11:32 - today the concept we're going to learn
11:33 - about is algorithms it's a computer
11:35 - science concept we're going to learn but
11:37 - we're going to learn this
11:39 - with a little bit of fun we're going to
11:40 - have three stages
11:42 - in today's code break
11:44 - segment one is gonna be learning
11:47 - unplugged algorithms segment two we're
11:50 - gonna do some live coding at a beginner
11:52 - level and then segment three we're gonna
11:53 - do some intermediate coding uh as we go
11:56 - along
11:57 - are you all ready to get started
12:00 - yes i am let's go
12:02 - so sound effects
12:05 - [Music]
12:06 - all right
12:08 - we're gonna learn about algorithms
12:10 - that's my favorite thing hottie
12:12 - algorithms i i feel like i am an
12:14 - algorithmic expert all the time awesome
12:18 - so
12:19 - an algorithm is a list of steps you give
12:21 - to a computer for what you want to do
12:23 - and we're going to do this by having our
12:25 - participants give instructions to give
12:27 - an algorithm to code
12:30 - to make a peanut butter and jelly
12:31 - sandwich so if i want to see all the
12:33 - students who joined us on screen
12:35 - i we told you in advance to write down
12:37 - your instructions for how to make a pb
12:39 - and j sandwich so if you have those can
12:42 - you hold up your instructions you wrote
12:44 - down on paper so we can see them all
12:49 - all right so i'm going to call out to
12:50 - somebody right before you start i want
12:52 - to ask everybody a question first okay a
12:55 - lot of people there was controversy
12:57 - about peanut butter versus almond butter
13:01 - so i got both i want to see what people
13:04 - want do they want me to make an almond
13:06 - butter sandwich with organic almond
13:08 - butter or do they want me to make a
13:09 - peanut butter
13:11 - oh that's moderation
13:14 - ray's hand to do that
13:16 - which one
13:18 - so to do this you have a button for
13:21 - ray's hand at the bottom of the screen
13:23 - raise your hand click this button if you
13:25 - want peanut butter
13:27 - click it if you want to be peanut butter
13:30 - raise your hand
13:33 - all right i see
13:35 - three four hundred and fifty cents
13:39 - 490 500 let's say 500 raised hands i
13:42 - think peanut butter is going to be
13:43 - winning here well you never know almond
13:45 - butter could make a big comeback no
13:47 - there's no way more than half of them
13:49 - want people no but they may vote again
13:51 - raise your hand
13:53 - lower your hands everybody lower your
13:55 - hands and we can lower your hands for
13:57 - you automatically
13:59 - to get it done peanut butter one you're
14:01 - right yeah peanut butter one peanut
14:03 - butter one
14:04 - all right so now sylvia and mark and nia
14:06 - are you all ready
14:10 - uh we're gonna unmute you so we can hear
14:12 - from
14:14 - you sylvian mark
14:19 - can
14:21 - and nia
14:23 - can somebody unmute sylvia and mark and
14:25 - nia
14:28 - i'm not sure whether you need to unmute
14:30 - on your end so we can hear you
14:40 - we're having trouble unmuting sylvia and
14:42 - mark all right
14:44 - uh nia are you ready
14:54 - can somebody unmute and yes
14:55 - the first panelists are for students to
14:57 - give us
15:00 - all right there we are silvia and mark
15:02 - thank you and first i should say that
15:04 - was our first
15:06 - bug
15:08 - so um nia
15:11 - we're going to hear from you right now
15:12 - nia we want to hear your instructions
15:14 - for making pb j sandwich but first can
15:16 - you say hi to us
15:23 - i can't hear can you get here
15:27 - we might have broken zoom i'm not even
15:29 - sure nia can you can you say hello
15:38 - let's go back to sylvia
15:41 - i can hear the twins i think
15:46 - sylvia and mark can we hear from
15:52 - you all right let me switch to somebody
15:55 - else we're going to switch to darius and
15:57 - mozzie
16:01 - darius and mazzy are you there
16:03 - yes can you guys hear us hi hi hi darius
16:06 - and mazzy all right so muzzy we want you
16:10 - to give hill
16:12 - directions for how to make a peanut
16:14 - butter and jelly sandwich so think in
16:16 - your mind how do you make peanut butter
16:18 - and jelly sandwich hill's got his peanut
16:20 - butter he's got bread and jelly and then
16:22 - give him the instructions but what's
16:24 - really important is you can you can't
16:26 - change the instructions after he'll
16:28 - started doing stuff you just need to
16:29 - tell him what to do
16:32 - mozzie are you ready
16:36 - have darius do it all right darius you
16:39 - could do it
16:40 - go ahead
16:42 - pick up a slice of bread and lay it flat
16:44 - on the table
16:46 - pick up a slice of bread
16:49 - and lay it flat on the table
16:53 - you really going to have me make a
16:54 - peanut butter sandwich on my table is
16:56 - that
16:57 - is that for me
16:59 - but i'm going to do it go ahead yep go
17:02 - um pick up a jar of jelly
17:07 - okay
17:08 - and untwist the lid to open it
17:12 - i'm twisting the lid to open
17:16 - pick up pick up your knife hello
17:19 - hello
17:21 - i don't have any hands left how do i
17:23 - pick up the knife
17:25 - put down the jar of jelly
17:29 - using the sharp side of the knife scoop
17:31 - out some jelly and
17:33 - put on the bread
17:39 - okay
17:41 - is this enough do more
17:44 - do more how much
17:48 - just do a lot until you think it's
17:50 - enough okay i'm gonna do a lot good job
17:54 - that should be enough
17:56 - okay
17:57 - phil can you bend down your
18:09 - now pick up your container of peanut
18:12 - butter
18:17 - open the peanut butter and do the exact
18:18 - same thing with the peanut butter that
18:20 - you did with the jelly
18:22 - okay
18:24 - put a lot on the bread
18:27 - okay
18:30 - it's not coming out the same way
18:36 - what do i do
18:38 - scoop it out using the knife
18:48 - okay
18:52 - good job now put
18:54 - okay stop stop stop now put the now pick
18:57 - up another slice of bread and put it on
18:59 - top of all of
19:01 - that stuff
19:03 - how do i pick it up
19:06 - put down everything you're holding just
19:08 - drop it
19:10 - [Laughter]
19:13 - pick up your pick up i think i broke my
19:15 - table
19:16 - what
19:17 - i think i broke my table
19:19 - that's okay don't that's not what we're
19:21 - worrying about right now pick up another
19:23 - slice of bread
19:27 - put it on top of your mound of jelly and
19:30 - peanut butter
19:34 - good job
19:35 - there you go
19:38 - all right
19:39 - can we all give hill a round of applause
19:42 - for making a peanut butter and jelly
19:43 - sandwich
19:45 - oh no
19:49 - it's a pretty big sandwich
19:54 - you want to try the salmon yeah
20:00 - so
20:02 - what we just saw we all remember when
20:04 - you're talking to a regular person
20:07 - we all know that when you're talking to
20:09 - a regular person they follow
20:10 - instructions way better than hill just
20:12 - did hill acted the way a computer would
20:16 - when you're giving instructions to a
20:17 - computer you have to be very precise a
20:20 - computer may seem smart but it's
20:22 - actually not smart at all
20:25 - no offense hill we know that you were
20:27 - acting
20:29 - a computer needs to hear instructions in
20:31 - the language it expects and they will
20:33 - make mistakes if you tell it to it'll
20:35 - eat as much peanut butter as you tell it
20:37 - to
20:38 - it doesn't know what you want it to do
20:40 - it only knows what you tell it to do
20:42 - remember the word of the day
20:44 - algorithm
20:46 - an algorithm is a list of steps you have
20:48 - a computer to finish a task it's like a
20:50 - recipe or driving directions and just
20:53 - now we made an algorithm for making a
20:54 - peanut butter and jelly sandwich
20:57 - now we're going to switch to doing some
20:59 - algorithm coding on a computer next but
21:02 - first i want to take a quick break for a
21:04 - trivia question
21:05 - it's trivia time
21:08 - sophia's got a trivia time sound so are
21:11 - you all ready for a trivia question
21:13 - remember the raise hand button we had i
21:15 - want you all to lower your hands
21:18 - so uh
21:20 - the folks in the control room can you
21:21 - lower everybody's hands
21:24 - so the trivia question for today's day
21:27 - is to ask was the first computer
21:30 - programmer a man or a woman
21:33 - was the first computer programmer a man
21:35 - or a woman raise your hand if you think
21:38 - the first computer programmer was a man
21:43 - all right
21:44 - how many hands do you see there
21:49 - hill how many hands do you see raise i
21:51 - see
21:52 - 199 hands raised
21:54 - 200 hands raids 208 hands raised
21:58 - 200.
22:00 - either people think it's a woman or they
22:01 - just don't know
22:03 - 230 230 people think it's a
22:06 - man
22:07 - all right 240.
22:10 - all right now everybody lower your hands
22:14 - lower your hands
22:17 - and the next question we want to ask is
22:19 - raise your hand if you think the first
22:21 - computer programmer
22:23 - was a man
22:25 - sorry it was a woman if you think the
22:26 - first computer programmer was a woman i
22:29 - do
22:30 - clicked click the raise hand button
22:32 - so
22:33 - what do you think computer programmer
22:35 - was a woman
22:36 - ray's hand
22:41 - wow there's a lot more people raising
22:43 - their hand thinking it's a woman so
22:46 - hill what do you think is the right
22:47 - answer oh i think it's definitely a
22:49 - woman there's no doubt about it
22:51 - i saw the movie hidden figures with my
22:54 - friend taraji p henson so i know
22:57 - it was a woman
23:01 - that's right
23:05 - i'm not saying it was kathleen johnson
23:07 - but you know
23:09 - so i'm sharing my screen right now do
23:11 - you all see my screen share
23:16 - wow my computer's going nuts with
23:18 - everybody's hands raised can somebody
23:20 - lower the hands so the first computer
23:22 - programmer was a woman named ada
23:24 - loveless
23:25 - ada lovelace i knew that i knew it
23:30 - all right well aydah loveless is the
23:32 - first known computer programmer and
23:34 - what's really interesting about ada
23:35 - loveless is not only that she was the
23:38 - first computer programmer but that she
23:40 - wrote the first computer program in 1842
23:43 - almost 100 years before the first
23:46 - computer was even invented or built so
23:49 - before we had any kind of computers to
23:51 - do the stuff we do for smartphones a
23:53 - hundred years earlier aydah loveless
23:55 - wrote the first computer program and the
23:57 - reason this is interesting is because a
24:00 - loveless did something very similar to
24:02 - what we did with our unplugged algorithm
24:04 - which we wrote for a peanut butter and
24:06 - jelly sandwich she was writing a
24:08 - computer program on paper
24:10 - so now we're gonna go do some real
24:13 - coding to make a computer program so i'm
24:14 - gonna go back to my screen share and
24:17 - sophia is going to do the coding for us
24:19 - sophia are you ready yes
24:21 - right uh so i'm going to go share my
24:23 - screen again
24:25 - sophia here is a practice coder but this
24:28 - is her first time doing something like
24:30 - this in front of such a large audience
24:33 - can you all see my screen again
24:36 - yes
24:38 - you can see the screen great
24:41 - sophia
24:42 - i'm going to explain the screen and what
24:43 - we see right here on the left side of
24:46 - the screen what you see is an artist
24:48 - he's a little guy with a big pencil and
24:50 - he's going to draw whatever we tell him
24:52 - to do
24:53 - in the middle of the screen you see the
24:54 - blocks for what the artist can do those
24:57 - are his commands and then on the right
24:59 - side of the screen is where sophia is
25:01 - going to make the code
25:02 - now sophia drag out
25:04 - one block to see
25:06 - what is going to happen
25:12 - all right so hill what do you think is
25:13 - going to happen when we drag out this
25:15 - one block
25:16 - it's going to the depends the artist is
25:18 - going to move straight across and draw
25:20 - something that's 100 pixels long i'm
25:22 - going to move forward for 100 pixels
25:25 - all right it sounds like you may have
25:27 - some prep for for doing this so the
25:29 - artist is going to move forward 100
25:30 - pixels are we right
25:32 - sophia are you going to hit the r oh you
25:34 - want to make a sound effect
25:41 - that's right
25:42 - all right so we do a hundred pixels and
25:44 - what's important about the artist is
25:46 - anytime he moves he's drawing if you
25:48 - want him to move without drawing you can
25:50 - use this jump command
25:52 - now the next thing i want to do is
25:53 - sophia is going to draw something with
25:55 - some instructions i'm gonna whisper in
25:57 - her ear and tell her what she's gonna
25:58 - draw and i want everybody in the
26:00 - audience to take out a piece of paper
26:02 - and a pencil
26:04 - and follow along as sophia's writing
26:06 - commands for the computer and draw what
26:08 - you think the computer is going to make
26:11 - and then we'll see if you got it right
26:12 - so sophia
26:16 - everybody follow along at home with a
26:18 - piece of paper and pencil
26:20 - and see if you can follow what sofia is
26:22 - doing
26:23 - and maybe you can draw the same shape as
26:24 - her and then we're going to see if you
26:26 - got it right
26:29 - so if you need to reset
26:34 - 90 degrees
26:35 - move forward turn right move forward 100
26:39 - pixels
26:42 - turn right
26:43 - by 90 degrees
26:46 - move forward 100 pixels
26:50 - turn right
26:54 - move forward 100 degrees
26:58 - and turn right
27:00 - one last
27:03 - time
27:05 - all right
27:07 - has everybody at home made their own
27:09 - guess as to what is going to happen i
27:11 - want to switch to see everybody we're
27:13 - going to stop the screen share
27:15 - and i want everybody who's on camera
27:18 - if you've drawn what you think is going
27:19 - to happen hold your drawing in front of
27:21 - the camera so we can see it
27:23 - those of you who aren't on camera can
27:25 - you type your guess into the chat box if
27:28 - you remember the chat box is the little
27:29 - sort of the thing that looks i don't
27:32 - know if you can see my camera or not but
27:33 - it looks like this
27:34 - click that and type your guess into the
27:36 - chat box hill what are you seeing on
27:38 - screen or in the chat what are people
27:39 - getting square square square box box box
27:42 - square square square box box box box
27:44 - square square square box box square
27:46 - square box so sophia are you ready to
27:50 - to share what happens you wanna do a
27:51 - drumroll sound before we see the answer
27:54 - look the drum roll
28:02 - oh yeah
28:03 - oh yeah
28:05 - oh yeah
28:06 - all right we have a square now again
28:08 - this is very beginner stuff any of you
28:10 - who've done coding before have known how
28:12 - to do this but we're gonna now get much
28:14 - faster quickly and do more interesting
28:15 - stuff so the first thing we want to do
28:18 - is to make our square a different color
28:20 - sophia can you choose a color for the
28:21 - square can you make it just be a random
28:23 - color
28:27 - all right now the square is going to set
28:29 - color to random so when you run it
28:31 - it's going to be a different color each
28:33 - time can you run it
28:36 - let's make it a little bit faster so it
28:38 - goes more quickly and i'll draw another
28:40 - square what color is that pink okay draw
28:43 - another square
28:44 - pink oh another square
28:47 - purple all right so we're getting lots
28:48 - of different colors but i'd love to see
28:50 - lots of these colors happen all at the
28:52 - same time so you can see multiple
28:54 - squares so i want to ask some of the
28:56 - folks who are on camera to to tell us
28:59 - how we can do that so uh
29:01 - can we unmute uh jack barry
29:06 - and we want to hear from you to see what
29:08 - your ideas are in terms of how we can
29:09 - get more squares on the screen because
29:11 - we want to have multiple squares of
29:12 - different colors
29:14 - uh
29:15 - jack are you there
29:17 - yep
29:18 - hi jack so how would you suggest for us
29:21 - to get multiple squares instead of
29:22 - having her to run and then stop and run
29:24 - and stop all over again
29:26 - uh
29:27 - multiple artists i guess
29:29 - multiple artists no we want one artist
29:31 - to do multiple squares
29:33 - a forever loop on a rotation
29:36 - a loop on a rotation
29:39 - and is barry there by any chance or is
29:41 - barry your last name
29:43 - no that's where i am
29:45 - oh you're from barry
29:47 - okay so multiple loops on a rotation so
29:49 - looking at the blocks that you see on
29:50 - the screen can you figure out a block
29:52 - that we can use for doing that uh the
29:55 - pink repeat question mark question mark
29:57 - question mark times
29:58 - all right let's drag that out
30:01 - so that block can repeat anything you
30:03 - put inside it as many times so how many
30:06 - times should we have this happen can
30:08 - folks in the chat window say how many
30:10 - times do we want to repeat and see a
30:12 - square
30:13 - four
30:14 - there's one percent four
30:16 - four five
30:19 - i want more 100 because somebody said
30:21 - 100. somebody said 100 sophia you want
30:24 - to type 100 in here
30:26 - and just make it go real fast so i want
30:28 - to see it fast and i want to see a
30:30 - hundred fast and 100
30:33 - super fast super fast all right hit run
30:35 - surf
30:42 - all right
30:43 - let's stop this so that's a hundred
30:45 - squares going by super fast but jack if
30:47 - you're still on there those squares are
30:49 - all on top of each other can you think
30:50 - of ideas how we can see those squares
30:52 - but see them all
30:54 - separate from each other
30:56 - yeah
30:57 - um either
30:58 - when they're done maybe set a script to
31:01 - turn them
31:02 - or move them somewhere else
31:05 - which of those do you want to do uh
31:06 - let's turn okay do a turn
31:10 - so after each square we're going to turn
31:12 - the artist a little bit
31:13 - why don't you turn them like three
31:15 - degrees
31:17 - and change the number up here to 120 so
31:21 - longer all right
31:23 - now hit run is everybody ready to see
31:24 - what's gonna happen drum roll
31:30 - oh yeah oh yeah
31:36 - i see in the chat room somebody wants us
31:38 - to do them like a trillion trillion
31:40 - squares
31:42 - and one thing i want to say for whoever
31:44 - typed that alex t and harley hendrickson
31:47 - who wanted a trillion trillion squares
31:49 - one of the amazing things about computer
31:51 - programming is you can tell a computer
31:53 - to repeat something as many times as you
31:54 - want and it doesn't get tired
31:57 - it doesn't say oh i want to go to bed
31:59 - the computer will repeat an algorithm
32:01 - over and over and it'll not make
32:03 - mistakes it'll do exactly what you tell
32:05 - it to do now you make mistakes in what
32:08 - you tell it but after you tell it what
32:09 - you want to do and then you ask it to
32:11 - repeat it it will do it over and over so
32:13 - we could have done a hundred times or a
32:15 - thousand times i think if we hit a
32:17 - million times i think that might have
32:18 - broken our computer because our computer
32:20 - here isn't good zach
32:22 - good job
32:24 - excellent
32:25 - thank you so much zach so i want to do
32:27 - something else now uh let's make this
32:29 - drawing a little bit more interesting
32:31 - we're going to add
32:32 - a cool little sticker to it sophia can
32:35 - you drag out the sticker block
32:37 - it's down at the bottom of the screen
32:40 - now i want to add the sticker right
32:42 - after the first move forward block so
32:44 - the first move block is when we begin
32:46 - the square so what are our options for
32:48 - what we can put in a sticker wow wow
32:50 - there's a lot of stickers there
32:53 - i'm also seeing a lot of people raising
32:55 - their hands if you raise your hand if
32:56 - you have questions type them into the q
32:59 - a area but now i want people to tell us
33:01 - what sticker should we use
33:03 - you see all these options for stickers
33:05 - on the screen
33:06 - type in your sticker choices and we can
33:08 - choose from them and he'll tell me what
33:10 - you said
33:11 - goes penguin wizard
33:13 - ninja
33:15 - i've seen a few penguins
33:16 - i think penguin a lot of penguins a lot
33:18 - of people penguin that's way too many
33:20 - choices let's let's actually do
33:22 - something different i want to have us
33:23 - take a simpler vote
33:25 - so i want us to choose between four
33:27 - options
33:28 - and we're going to choose the top four
33:30 - options you wanted a penguin hill
33:33 - well i i was just i was just being the
33:35 - voice of the people yeah the voice of
33:37 - the people you think is a penguin what
33:39 - what do you want as your favorite option
33:41 - oh
33:42 - um
33:44 - i'm my favorite option i like this
33:45 - little guy down here bottom left i don't
33:47 - even know what you call him but he's got
33:49 - the big eyes and he's hanging out little
33:51 - guy down here all right sophia what do
33:52 - you want
33:53 - uh let's
33:55 - do
33:56 - the chicken where's the chicken i don't
33:59 - know can you point to the chicken
34:01 - that one
34:02 - there the chicken yeah and that's the
34:04 - guy's name number two what is his name
34:08 - i'm gonna choose a little alien oh not
34:10 - an alien it's a zombie
34:12 - all right so now
34:13 - in the chat room type the number for who
34:15 - you want number two you guys
34:18 - number two number two go two
34:22 - take two big two all right hill it
34:24 - sounds like everybody wants your choice
34:26 - so we're gonna go with number two here
34:29 - and we're gonna close our little voting
34:30 - area sophia you wanna choose
34:32 - the little guy a little guy with the big
34:34 - eyes
34:36 - over there little guy with the big guys
34:37 - and now for the turns here can we make
34:39 - each of these turns
34:41 - 33 degrees apart so people can see
34:44 - these stickers a little bit apart all
34:46 - right now hit run
34:56 - oh yeah
34:57 - so every time we draw a square we're
34:59 - adding a sticker
35:00 - and it's doing it over and over again
35:04 - 120 times that little guy is getting
35:07 - repeated many many times
35:09 - and so it's basically adding to our
35:10 - picture here
35:12 - now one thing you notice is i change the
35:13 - angle as we're going along one of the
35:15 - best things about computer programming
35:17 - in computer science is unlike a lot of
35:19 - subjects you learn in school it's not
35:21 - just about getting it right or getting
35:23 - it wrong what we're doing here is just
35:25 - we're being creative and we're playing
35:26 - around so there's not really a right or
35:29 - wrong answer just like an art class your
35:31 - art teacher doesn't usually tell you oh
35:33 - that that picture was wrong or you got
35:35 - it right you're just making something
35:37 - pretty that you can then share
35:39 - and when you're done making it you can
35:41 - click the finish button
35:42 - and you can see what you made
35:44 - you have a url to it that you can send
35:47 - you can send it to your mom or dad's
35:48 - phone or if you have a social media
35:50 - account if you are a mom and dad you can
35:52 - post it to social media or if you want
35:54 - to change it and you want to keep going
35:56 - you can click keep playing and mess
35:58 - around with it some more that's going to
36:00 - be my new profile shot on my instagram
36:03 - it's going to be all right people are
36:04 - going to love it
36:06 - so
36:07 - uh i'm going to stop the screen share
36:09 - for a second and i want to see if we
36:11 - have any questions
36:12 - from our from the folks who've been in
36:13 - the audience we might not but uh
36:16 - [Music]
36:18 - i want to give a chance if folks have
36:19 - had any questions from what they've seen
36:21 - before and these could be questions
36:23 - about what's honorary fans there's a lot
36:25 - of raised hands we did have one question
36:28 - um it was specifically for hill was the
36:30 - peanut butter and jelly sandwich
36:31 - delicious what type of jelly was it
36:33 - where did you get it oh okay well i'll
36:36 - answer that
36:38 - it was organic wild maine blueberry jam
36:41 - so this is from maine
36:43 - um fancy stuff great state
36:46 - from stonewall kitchen
36:48 - and then the peanut butter was this
36:50 - organic peanut butter from trader joe's
36:51 - which is good now the bread was this
36:53 - some kind of
36:55 - some kind of organic seedless bread
36:57 - whatever
36:58 - i think that the directions overdid the
37:01 - jam it's too sweet
37:03 - it's too much jam in a jam to peanut
37:06 - butter ratio
37:08 - i'm eating it anyway because i'm really
37:10 - hungry
37:11 - but it's a little the jam to peanut
37:13 - ratio is not programmed properly and
37:16 - that's no knock against the programmer i
37:19 - know that it was their first time
37:20 - programming a peanut butter and jelly
37:22 - sandwich or coding one so i think the
37:25 - next time we code this like hottie said
37:27 - there's no right or wrong that we should
37:28 - code less jam
37:30 - and more peanut butter
37:33 - and maybe even less bread to be honest i
37:35 - i could do for just like one slice
37:37 - folded over something like that but
37:38 - that's just me that's just me personally
37:41 - all right there's a question from
37:43 - christine hawley asking about the artist
37:46 - saying is forward relative to where you
37:48 - are because when sophia said move
37:51 - forward turn right move forward turn
37:53 - right
37:54 - i thought it was going to be stairs
37:56 - because i thought forward always meant
37:58 - right and so christine forward depends
38:01 - on which direction the artist is facing
38:03 - if the artist is facing right move
38:05 - forward takes it to the right side of
38:07 - the screen when the artist turns right
38:10 - then it turns
38:12 - relative to where it was already pointed
38:14 - and then it points down and then it
38:16 - moves forward to go down and then if it
38:17 - turns right again it'll actually be
38:19 - facing left
38:21 - so and each time it moves it goes in a
38:24 - direction and each time it turns it
38:26 - changes that direction
38:28 - all right that's a good question
38:30 - so howdy just so i know how did would
38:32 - you do steps
38:33 - since she thought that was steps how
38:35 - would you do steps do you want to take a
38:37 - guess at that hill
38:38 - i absolutely do not okay i assume you go
38:42 - move forward left then go move forward
38:44 - right move forward left move forward
38:45 - right exactly move forward
38:48 - turn left which is actually going to
38:50 - then punch you up and then go up
38:53 - in fact let's go do that right now and
38:55 - i'll show you how that would work
38:57 - uh if i take these squares
39:00 - and i'm just going to take
39:02 - go back to your screen so we can see you
39:03 - cody
39:05 - yeah sorry thank you
39:06 - and we're a little bit off script but i
39:08 - want to do this because somebody asked a
39:09 - question about it and it'd be helpful to
39:11 - see the difference and then we're going
39:12 - to get into advanced coding afterwards
39:15 - so
39:16 - here we are
39:20 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
39:21 - reset this little thing we have with the
39:23 - sticker and i'm going to get rid of the
39:25 - sticker for now but we'll bring it back
39:26 - in a second we're going to move forward
39:28 - 100 and then you set to turn left then
39:32 - move forward and turn right and then
39:34 - move forward and turn
39:36 - left then move forward and turn right
39:39 - and if we do that it'll draw stairs
39:44 - and i can make it so that each one of
39:45 - these stairs is
39:47 - is 10 steps long
39:51 - and in fact after i just do two stairs
39:53 - like this move forward turn left
39:56 - i can then repeat that
40:02 - 120 times
40:05 - [Laughter]
40:07 - and it's drawing stairs of different
40:08 - colors wow
40:11 - wow you sound super excited sophia so
40:14 - christine thank you so much for that
40:15 - wonderful question i'm not sure if you
40:17 - uh we're hoping to get that much
40:18 - attention to your question but thank you
40:20 - christine
40:21 - and we hope you try coding yourself and
40:23 - after the show we're going to send the
40:25 - links so you can practice with this but
40:27 - what i want to do next is to show more
40:29 - advanced coding
40:31 - and if you remember and you can see on
40:33 - my screen we're now in section three of
40:35 - showing more intermediate level coding
40:37 - sofia are you ready for this part yeah
40:40 - so i'm going to be doing the coding on
40:42 - this part now and uh sophia is going to
40:44 - be making sound effects and making fun
40:45 - of me as we go along
40:47 - and
40:49 - we're now in a slightly more advanced
40:51 - version of the same tool so this is a
40:54 - more advanced version of artists you
40:56 - have the same blocks but they're not all
40:58 - laid out here they're in different
40:59 - sections so there's action blocks like
41:01 - move forward or turn right or jump
41:03 - forward
41:04 - there's brush blocks and one of them for
41:07 - example sets the width of the brush
41:09 - i'm going to set the width of the brush
41:11 - to 1 so it's like draws a thin line so
41:14 - we can draw more fine-tuned stuff but
41:16 - you can see we have loops like the
41:18 - repeat block and these other things like
41:20 - logic for if then statements or
41:22 - functions and variables and these are
41:25 - other computer science concepts that
41:26 - we're going to learn over time
41:28 - so the first thing i want to do is show
41:31 - how we can just draw a simple square
41:33 - like we did before
41:34 - i'm going to draw a repeat block and
41:36 - again this is going to be relatively
41:38 - simple but then we're going to get a
41:39 - little bit more advanced so i'm going to
41:40 - say let's move forward
41:42 - let's say 50 pixels
41:45 - and then turn right
41:49 - 90 degrees
41:51 - and a square if we move forward turn
41:52 - right and repeat it over and over
41:55 - four times this should draw a square
41:59 - it's a fewer lines of code to draw a
42:00 - square how exciting was that sif
42:05 - all right sophia's falling asleep um now
42:08 - we can try try drawing different squirt
42:10 - shapes by drawing angles so let's draw
42:12 - let's say a triangle that's got three
42:14 - sides so i'm going to repeat three times
42:17 - what's the angle we should do for a
42:19 - triangle this is something that gets
42:21 - confusing sometimes because
42:23 - if you're in math class you know that
42:24 - the angle of the inside of a triangle
42:27 - if it looks like this is 60 degrees but
42:29 - when when we're an artist the artist is
42:32 - actually turning so the artist's angle
42:35 - is this outside angle of the turn that's
42:37 - 120 degrees the inside of the triangle
42:40 - over here is 60 degrees so if we have a
42:43 - 120 degree turn and we do it three times
42:46 - we get a triangle
42:48 - and we can now do a hexagon
42:50 - six times and since i've done this
42:52 - before we can go 660 degrees
42:55 - and this will draw a hexagon
42:58 - or we can go you want to do pentagon
43:00 - sophia pentagon is 72 degrees
43:04 - now i've memorized these degree numbers
43:06 - but you can just learn them through
43:07 - experiment
43:09 - you think i haven't memorized an octagon
43:11 - i'll figure it out for an octagon it's
43:14 - 45 degrees
43:16 - and we can do eight times
43:18 - [Laughter]
43:21 - all right was that exciting for you
43:22 - sophia
43:24 - wow you got excited by that
43:27 - sophia has never seen me draw an octagon
43:29 - before um so
43:31 - now i'm going to change this to say we
43:32 - can do whatever shape we want so instead
43:34 - of repeating eight times i'll say let's
43:36 - repeat 100 times
43:39 - and so we can change different degrees
43:41 - so we can make
43:43 - very few degrees
43:44 - sorry very tight turns like 160 degree
43:47 - turns and if we hit reset and run look
43:50 - what it does and it just goes over and
43:51 - over on top of itself
43:53 - or we can make a slightly weirder number
43:57 - and now it's going to draw this cool
43:58 - little circle
44:01 - but now i want to show
44:03 - a different type of repeat loop because
44:06 - what we're doing right here is just
44:08 - repeating over and over and over and
44:10 - drawing the same line
44:12 - and then uh
44:14 - and and basically it's the same and by
44:15 - the way i want to say for some people
44:17 - that are asking how is this coding even
44:19 - working why is it going with blocks
44:20 - instead of what they expect as coding
44:23 - everything we're doing here is actually
44:25 - under the hood is javascript so if you
44:28 - see this right here this is the
44:30 - javascript code that matches
44:33 - the blocks over here
44:34 - it's literally the same thing but this
44:37 - is how computer programmers in the real
44:39 - world do it they write this stuff by
44:41 - typing it instead of dragging and
44:42 - dropping blocks
44:44 - but it doesn't matter you can do the
44:46 - same thing with blocks and when we learn
44:47 - about algorithms
44:49 - it doesn't matter whether you're typing
44:50 - or not it's matters which blocks and
44:51 - which commands you use
44:53 - so what we're going to do now is do this
44:55 - new type of loop instead of the repeat
44:56 - loop we're going to do a for loop so if
44:58 - you have you learned this before
45:01 - this is your first time too isn't it
45:03 - this for loop is a counter and we said
45:05 - let's repeat
45:06 - before we were saying let's repeat 100
45:08 - times so we can do the same thing let's
45:10 - count from one
45:12 - to a hundred
45:13 - a thousand uh i'll say it's count from
45:16 - one to five hundred
45:18 - um
45:19 - actually but you can choose how much you
45:21 - wanna count by so let's count by fives
45:24 - so i'm gonna count from
45:26 - or shall we count by threes we'll count
45:28 - from three to five hundred going in
45:30 - steps of three each okay so it's going
45:32 - to go 3 6 9 and so on
45:36 - and what we're going to do is after each
45:38 - step
45:40 - it's going to move forward 50 pixels but
45:42 - if you run this it's just basically
45:43 - drawing a square
45:45 - what we can do is since the counter is
45:47 - changing it starts at three and then it
45:49 - goes at six
45:51 - hill what do you think we could do to
45:52 - make each one of these steps a different
45:54 - length
45:56 - we could change
45:58 - change the number of pixels it moves
46:00 - forward
46:01 - right so instead of going 50 pixels now
46:04 - what number you can do if you want it to
46:05 - be different each time there's a
46:07 - variable called counter
46:09 - that matches what's happening in the
46:11 - repeat loop
46:12 - have it add 10 pixels every time it goes
46:16 - so it's the first time it's going to be
46:18 - going three pixels the next time six
46:22 - because we start at three and it's going
46:24 - to go to 500. that's it and we'll run
46:26 - this in really slow motion so you see
46:27 - what it does it goes forward three
46:30 - turns goes forward six
46:33 - turns goes forward nine
46:35 - then twelve
46:37 - then fifteen
46:38 - then eighteen
46:41 - then 21
46:42 - and then 24. do you want to make it
46:44 - faster sophia all right we're going to
46:45 - go faster
46:46 - the nice thing is computers can go super
46:48 - fast
46:55 - sophia is that good for you yeah all
46:57 - right so look how few lines of code it
47:00 - took to do this just counting move
47:02 - forward turning right and now what's
47:04 - great about this is if you experiment
47:05 - with this here we can do lots of
47:07 - interesting things so now i can do 120
47:10 - degrees like what makes a triangle
47:13 - and i run the same thing
47:15 - and it makes a triangle like shape
47:17 - [Laughter]
47:23 - you want to do an octagon
47:25 - we can do the oops
47:28 - we haven't done an octagon before except
47:29 - a little bit earlier if you do the same
47:31 - thing with an octagon
47:32 - it makes an octagon-like shape
47:35 - now i want to show something else we can
47:37 - do we can go into brushes
47:40 - and choose a different pattern for the
47:41 - brush
47:43 - there's many patterns we can choose from
47:45 - here there's four or five so can folks
47:47 - in the chat room say what pattern we
47:49 - should use
47:51 - you can see a line a rainbow
47:53 - a rope
47:54 - a squiggly
47:56 - or what would you call this one here
47:58 - it's a chain
48:00 - a chain
48:01 - all right what are folks asking for
48:03 - rainbow is winning by a
48:05 - rainbow is winning by a total landslide
48:08 - so let's do a rainbow and i'm going to
48:10 - run this ready set go
48:16 - all right that's pretty cool
48:21 - so
48:22 - i want to try something different i'm
48:23 - going to go back to a regular line
48:25 - and going back to the way we were doing
48:27 - it as a square do you remember when we
48:29 - had this as a square when it drew like
48:31 - this
48:33 - what's pretty cool is if you make it
48:34 - just this is a 90 degree turn which is
48:37 - what squares have but what if we made it
48:39 - just a little bit less or more than 90
48:42 - degrees so 89 degrees the turn on these
48:44 - angles will be a little bit tighter than
48:46 - a square
48:47 - so if you run this it's going to spiral
48:55 - and you actually don't need to be a
48:56 - geometry expert to do this you just
48:59 - experiment and play with different
49:00 - numbers and see what it does but if we
49:02 - did this now with a rainbow
49:05 - check out how it looks
49:06 - [Laughter]
49:10 - come on sophia can i get a sound for
49:11 - that
49:14 - yay
49:24 - you want to do a squiggle so let's try a
49:26 - different angle now so i'm going to do
49:27 - like
49:28 - this angle and see what happens
49:31 - [Laughter]
49:33 - and there's a squiggle going around like
49:35 - that
49:38 - you want to do ropes i see a lot of
49:40 - ropes which is the rope oh that's the
49:42 - rope yeah that weird a lot of people ask
49:44 - for rope right let's pick a different
49:46 - angle for this
49:47 - i'm gonna go like that angle
49:49 - [Music]
49:55 - it doesn't look like real rocks
50:00 - so
50:01 - the reason i wanted to show you all this
50:03 - if you see how many lines of code we
50:05 - have here one two three four five lines
50:07 - of code and in fact we don't even need
50:09 - to set the width of this brush anymore
50:12 - so the code that does that in javascript
50:14 - is just those lines of code and if you
50:17 - change the angle and change the pattern
50:19 - you can get all sorts of different
50:21 - drawings
50:22 - it's really not that complicated
50:26 - if you forgot how i did this this whole
50:28 - live stream of this is going to be on
50:29 - youtube as well so you can do it
50:31 - yourself and now what we want to talk
50:33 - about is how you can go learn at home
50:35 - and try doing this at home to make your
50:37 - own beautiful drawings and by the way
50:39 - you don't need to be limited to these
50:40 - five lines of code this is just what i
50:42 - showed today but there's lots and lots
50:44 - of different commands you can use in
50:46 - this area to make interesting stuff
50:49 - so
50:50 - let me get off of the screen share for a
50:51 - second now
50:54 - bill you still with us i'm i'm here that
50:56 - was fantastic i'm excited to go do it
50:59 - myself and create some amazing art
51:02 - through coding
51:04 - all right
51:05 - so
51:05 - uh
51:07 - what i want to ask for folks to do is
51:08 - when you think about uh making these art
51:11 - we're going to give you some uh
51:12 - basically some challenges some take-home
51:14 - questions or basically some take-home
51:16 - work to to try this on your own
51:18 - before we go into that i want to ask are
51:20 - there any more questions akira have
51:22 - there been any questions that came in on
51:23 - the on the message line
51:25 - there have we have a couple for you and
51:27 - a couple for hill
51:28 - so for you hottie someone asked um i
51:32 - have two six-year-old boys and i'm
51:33 - teaching them coding through code.org
51:35 - although sometimes their attention
51:37 - strays and they get bored what advice
51:39 - would you have for somebody learning
51:40 - coding and they may be a bit discouraged
51:44 - um
51:45 - so my first thought is coding is a lot
51:47 - more fun when you make it creative
51:49 - and you know on code.org we have some
51:51 - exercises but we also have some projects
51:54 - so if you're on code.org there's a
51:56 - little create button and if they're
51:58 - bored having them go into the create
52:00 - button into the artist which just takes
52:01 - you to this tool we just showed let's
52:03 - give them a chance to make what they
52:04 - want rather than doing sort of the more
52:07 - school-like exercises uh
52:09 - but i also would say since they're kids
52:11 - let them take a break as well you know
52:13 - at code.org we're very aware that
52:15 - parents don't want their kids in front
52:16 - of screens the whole time being in front
52:18 - of a screen coding is wonderful because
52:20 - it's creative and educational we also
52:22 - have unplugged activities that kids can
52:24 - do to learn computer science a lot like
52:27 - when we had peeled and make a peanut
52:28 - butter and jelly sandwich and in fact
52:30 - we're gonna send an email at the end of
52:32 - this to tell you about an unplugged
52:34 - activity that kids can do together or
52:37 - with you that teaches the same kind of
52:39 - concepts but without the screen and it's
52:40 - a little bit more fun because it's more
52:42 - physical and sort of you know in the
52:44 - real world
52:47 - great and for hill how did you first get
52:49 - involved in computer science and what
52:52 - does it look like in your everyday life
52:54 - oh wow so it seems like technology's
52:56 - everywhere um you know i feel like i
53:00 - have to come with me i'll show you
53:02 - something i just
53:04 - i have a sh this shower right
53:06 - and
53:07 - it feels like i have to know how to code
53:10 - like i have to know how to code to turn
53:13 - on the shower so this is like a glimpse
53:16 - into the future i feel like because i
53:18 - couldn't even if i didn't know how to
53:21 - it's like this shower is so confusing to
53:23 - me but that's the way we are we're in a
53:25 - place but
53:26 - i think hottie would tell you i honey
53:29 - aren't we at an inflection point where
53:31 - technology and coding is actually going
53:34 - to get more user-friendly just like
53:36 - using a computer has gotten more
53:38 - user-friendly like like instead of
53:39 - having to learn how to write javascript
53:42 - or instead of having to learn how to do
53:44 - i hate to say this long division we can
53:45 - actually use a calculator is that going
53:48 - to be the same for coding as time kind
53:50 - of goes by that we don't have to learn
53:52 - how to do javascript we can just learn
53:54 - how to put things together and then we
53:55 - could be even more creative because
53:57 - we're not so much spending so much
53:59 - mental energy on learning
54:01 - the actual
54:02 - it's like you learn how to drive a car
54:04 - but you don't necessarily have to be a
54:05 - mechanic to drive a car right
54:08 - absolutely so first of all in case
54:10 - anybody is wondering whether the
54:12 - question that was just asked or the view
54:14 - into hills shower was planned that was
54:16 - definitely not planned i wasn't
54:17 - expecting to see the inside of your
54:19 - shower
54:20 - on our first code break so thank you
54:22 - hill for for walking us into the to the
54:25 - shower for that uh
54:26 - sneak peek of of the the tablet you've
54:29 - got there but yeah absolutely computer
54:31 - programming when my father first learned
54:33 - it involved punching holes into a
54:36 - cardboard piece of paper and whether
54:38 - there was a hole or not a hole was kind
54:40 - of a one or a zero and you
54:42 - shoved that into a computer and that was
54:43 - how you did your computer program and
54:45 - then 10 years later you had to type
54:47 - numbers on a typewriter but those
54:49 - numbers were the computer program and
54:51 - then as time has gone on you have to
54:53 - learn these sort of more sort of
54:56 - english looking like languages like the
54:58 - javascript language i showed earlier and
55:00 - now as you can see this dragging and
55:02 - dropping of blocks you can use those the
55:05 - block-based programming to do very very
55:07 - complicated stuff
55:08 - and it's getting easier and easier so
55:11 - what's great about computer science is
55:13 - as it gets easier
55:14 - more of the sort of busy work goes out
55:16 - of the way and it's much more about
55:18 - learning how to communicate what it is
55:20 - that you want and in fact
55:23 - you know computer scientists often are
55:24 - very good compu communicators because
55:26 - they practiced communicating what they
55:28 - want or what they need but they're also
55:30 - very literal and very explicit because
55:32 - the more you work on programming a
55:34 - computer it's like programming hill was
55:36 - for making a peanut butter and jelly
55:38 - sandwich and they want to know exactly
55:40 - and very precisely what's needed but the
55:42 - actual languages are getting easier and
55:44 - easier i started on c which wasn't
55:47 - nearly as easy as python which is one of
55:49 - the most popular programming languages
55:50 - which is just easier to type
55:53 - you're learning python why are you
55:54 - learning python tech class i didn't know
55:56 - that that's pretty awesome
55:58 - all right
55:59 - we're almost out of time so what i want
56:01 - to talk about is
56:02 - the exercises we want to do before next
56:05 - week so we're going to send you all an
56:07 - email with exercises you can make
56:09 - if you aren't signed up for our email
56:11 - list go to code.org
56:14 - make sure this is in front of break
56:15 - camera code.org
56:17 - break
56:19 - we're not going to send you marketing
56:20 - messages you're just going to get a an
56:22 - email with the exercises with the links
56:24 - to where we just were playing ourselves
56:26 - so you can make your own stuff
56:28 - what you're going to get is if you're a
56:30 - beginner
56:31 - you're going to get an exercise that
56:33 - asks you to make this drawing this is
56:35 - really not that hard to do and all of
56:38 - you can do it i am sure
56:40 - if you're more advanced
56:43 - sophie is going to hold up what we want
56:44 - you to do
56:45 - which is that drawing this is a lot
56:47 - harder it's it's a 10 by 10 grid of
56:50 - squares so it's a hundred little squares
56:52 - but this is interesting because what
56:54 - you're going to need to do to make that
56:55 - is come up with an algorithm that's
56:57 - different than what we showed you and as
56:59 - you look at this you have to ask well
57:00 - what's the algorithm for doing this
57:02 - maybe you want to draw 10 lines across
57:04 - and 10 lines going up and down
57:07 - maybe you want to make a row of squares
57:09 - and then come back and make another row
57:10 - of squares maybe you could do sort of a
57:12 - spiral of squares going around in a
57:14 - circle
57:15 - you can come up with your own algorithm
57:18 - and
57:19 - you know we talked about algorithms
57:21 - before like i said there's not a right
57:23 - or wrong
57:24 - way to go about making that square you
57:26 - could do one of many different ways and
57:28 - we want to see what way you come up with
57:30 - after you make your algorithms what we
57:32 - want to do is to have you make your own
57:34 - creative creation
57:36 - so here are examples of things you can
57:38 - make with code that sophia and i made
57:40 - earlier so if you want to hold your
57:42 - examples up
57:44 - it is as you saw very easy to make cool
57:47 - drawings like this on code.org
57:49 - somebody's posting something of this
57:51 - nature roughly every two minutes so
57:54 - everybody in this group can make your
57:55 - own drawing and parents if you're there
57:57 - we want you to share these drawings to
58:00 - social media
58:02 - if you share the social media use the
58:03 - hashtag codebreak so the team at
58:06 - code.org can
58:07 - what you've created and we have over 2
58:09 - million people who follow code.org on
58:11 - twitter and facebook and on instagram
58:13 - and they would love to see what your
58:14 - students are making
58:16 - for those of you who don't have
58:17 - computers at home we have two options
58:19 - you can do coding on smartphones and
58:22 - we're going to send options in that
58:23 - email for how your students can download
58:25 - an app to learn how to code and also if
58:27 - they don't have a smartphone or you just
58:29 - want to give them less screen time
58:30 - there's an unplugged activity as i said
58:32 - earlier which teaches them how to make
58:34 - algorithms without using a computer all
58:37 - you need is a bunch of paper cups and
58:39 - i'm sure that with this
58:40 - chronovirus quarantine i bet many of you
58:42 - have paper cups
58:44 - and so you can learn how to make an
58:45 - algorithm without writing any code
58:48 - so again if you haven't signed up
58:50 - already
58:51 - sign up at code.org break or just google
58:54 - code break and you'll get to see how
58:56 - that works
58:58 - uh so we're now done with the show i
59:00 - want to say thank you to everybody can
59:01 - we get all the audience on camera so we
59:03 - can say goodbye to all of them at once
59:05 - and can we unmute everybody so everybody
59:08 - can say bye everybody
59:14 - [Music]
59:22 - can we end with like a dance party or
59:23 - something sophia you got any music let's
59:25 - end with a little dance party
59:28 - in a dance party
59:33 - so before we close i want to recognize
59:36 - what a unique time we're in
59:38 - with tens of millions of students at
59:39 - home and the entire human race working
59:41 - together to fight a new virus
59:43 - none of us have anything like this i
59:45 - know we're all making the best of us
59:48 - so many groups are using their
59:49 - imaginations to solve old problems in
59:51 - new ways and that's what we're trying to
59:53 - do here
59:54 - [Music]
59:57 - to a chance to give you an hour of
59:59 - education
60:00 - and a moment of community in the middle
60:02 - of all our aloneness and i want to give
60:03 - a special thanks to my friend hill
60:06 - harper for being such a great sport and
60:08 - joining us for our first code break
60:10 - are you stuck at home and tired of
60:11 - studying
60:12 - take a code break and goodbye
60:22 - [Music]
60:27 - all everybody
60:28 - bye everybody
60:42 - [Music]
60:45 - that's not
61:12 - [Music]
61:34 - [Music]
61:37 - leave meetings
61:40 - [Music]
62:12 - um
