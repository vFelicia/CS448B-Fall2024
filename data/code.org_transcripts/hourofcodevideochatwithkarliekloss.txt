00:00 - hello everyone i'm maria from co.org
00:02 - thanks for joining us today for a
00:04 - special hour of code video chat to
00:06 - celebrate Computer Science Education
00:07 - Week today we have Karlie Kloss joining
00:10 - the QA Carly's an entrepreneur and one
00:13 - of fashion's top models who plunged into
00:15 - her very first programming courses past
00:17 - year please join me in welcoming Carly
00:41 - morning Wallis beautiful but I'm excited
00:46 - to be here and I'm excited to talk to
00:48 - you guys I appreciate this opportunity
00:50 - to connect with you I wish I was
00:54 - actually there in person and could meet
00:57 - you guys but um this is kind of awesome
01:01 - that I'm sitting in my kitchen and I can
01:02 - talk to to you guys all over the country
01:05 - so I'm excited to be here so I'm ready
01:09 - to begin
01:13 - excellent our first question is from
01:16 - Fort Greene Preparatory Academy in
01:18 - Brooklyn New York good morning good
01:26 - morning take to your question okay so
01:32 - how does the model industry a technology
01:35 - work together first of all you look
01:40 - beautiful even a little fuzzy in this
01:42 - very beautiful um yeah I you know
01:46 - surprisingly the modeling industry and
01:49 - the technology world are connected in
01:52 - many more ways than you would imagine um
01:56 - I started modeling when I was 15 years
01:59 - old actually 14 years old so probably
02:02 - the age of a lot of you guys out there I
02:06 - too in the last 8 years of working in
02:10 - the fashion industry and as a model I
02:13 - seen the way that technology has really
02:15 - impacted the world but specifically my
02:19 - job as a model it's essentially given me
02:23 - a voice you know platforms like
02:27 - Instagram like Twitter like Facebook
02:30 - give me an opportunity to sort of show
02:34 - Who I am and and sort of what I think
02:37 - and connect with people all around the
02:40 - world in a way that just was never
02:43 - possible before so as a model um you
02:47 - know I'm able to connect with you guys
02:49 - through my platforms through Instagram
02:52 - you know I can share with you what I'm
02:54 - doing today or you know backstage at
02:59 - Fashion Week I can share that with you
03:01 - um and and I think that's really
03:03 - exciting because that just was never
03:06 - possible before is the modeling industry
03:08 - and the fashion industry which is foods
03:10 - very sort of small and exclusive and if
03:14 - you work backstage at the show you had
03:16 - no idea that it even was going on so
03:19 - through these sort of platforms I can
03:21 - connect with anybody who cares to follow
03:26 - and the other really interesting cool
03:28 - part is that I think in fashion you know
03:31 - there's so many cool ways that
03:33 - technology and fashion are sort of
03:36 - working together like I don't know if
03:38 - you guys everyone anyone has like a
03:42 - jawbone or wearable tech like a Fitbit
03:45 - or you know all of all of a sudden a
03:49 - wearable tech has been on the runway
03:51 - Google Glasses Diane von Furstenberg
03:54 - head Google glasses in her runway Tory
03:57 - Burch also so a lot of these fashion
03:59 - designers are realizing that fashion and
04:03 - technology there's unlimited potential
04:06 - to work together so surprisingly there's
04:09 - a lot of crossover and and it's been
04:12 - cool because I've seen I've seen it
04:15 - happen throughout my career since I was
04:17 - 15 since I was your age I was I had a
04:20 - job working in the fashion industry so
04:23 - I've learned a lot
04:27 - our second question is from Wilde Lake
04:30 - Middle School in Columbia Maryland whoo
04:33 - hello
04:36 - go ahead are you guys seeing the
04:38 - question okay how did you get started in
04:40 - coding oh oh
04:45 - hi my name is idea what is I hired you
04:48 - hello my name is Kayla and who helped
04:53 - you get started
04:55 - these are awesome questions um
04:58 - especially since I don't think it's
05:00 - normally what you would expect a model
05:03 - in fashion to care about coding um and
05:06 - and I think that's why I really enjoy it
05:09 - is because it's something so it's
05:14 - something that you know you would think
05:17 - I have no reason to know or to care
05:20 - about but I don't think it matters if
05:23 - you're a fashion model or if you're you
05:25 - know a student in middle school or high
05:28 - school you know with that skill set with
05:32 - knowing how to code or at least even
05:34 - understanding that it's the way that
05:37 - everything is built I think that's so
05:40 - important and even if you're not you
05:43 - know a programmer and that's not the
05:45 - career you want to go into
05:50 - great we'll move on to our third
05:52 - question from Gateway High School in
05:56 - Monroeville Pennsylvania cool okay so
06:00 - our school wanted to know what the
06:01 - coolest thing you've made so far with
06:03 - code is or was okay so I'm very proud of
06:09 - it because I think drones are amazing
06:14 - kind of scary but they're a really
06:17 - exciting technology and I learned how to
06:20 - program drones to ship essentially just
06:23 - fly and we were practicing sort of
06:26 - within a classroom space so it didn't we
06:30 - didn't even have to think about factors
06:32 - like wind like rain but the idea of
06:35 - programming a drone to you know
06:39 - potentially deliver something that's
06:41 - what I was playing with so I don't know
06:44 - um I'll tell you a little bit about me I
06:46 - have outside of my modeling career I
06:49 - have this sort of charity project that I
06:51 - have a cooking line like a vegan healthy
06:55 - but yummy cookie line and I thought it'd
06:58 - be cool to deliver the cookies via drone
07:01 - or at least potentially someday down the
07:05 - line deliver my cookies via drone so I
07:08 - am I programmed the drone to sort of fly
07:12 - across the room and it sounds really
07:15 - easy but it was surprisingly complicated
07:19 - because there were just so many things
07:21 - that you have to think about you know
07:22 - how fast to fly the drone how far it was
07:25 - really fun though um but yeah I'm kind
07:28 - of I'm kind of a nerd if you can't pick
07:30 - that up by now but um programming drones
07:33 - was probably the funnest thing I've
07:35 - learned so far very cool all right our
07:39 - fourth question is from Shelburne
07:41 - Community School in Shelburne Vermont
07:42 - our fourth question is from Shelburne
07:46 - Community School in Shelburne Vermont
07:49 - hi I'm Delaney and in your opinion why
07:52 - do you think more girls should study
07:53 - computer science so when I was in school
07:58 - a middle school and high school Computer
08:01 - Sciences wasn't offered
08:03 - as an option even to two boys or girls
08:06 - just to any student and I really wish I
08:10 - would have been exposed to this the
08:15 - opportunity to understand
08:20 - it is the language that essentially
08:23 - writes everything it's why what you and
08:27 - I are able to talk right now
08:28 - over a Google hangout is because
08:31 - somebody wrote that with code and not
08:34 - something that I just have learned in
08:37 - year of taking lessons and the teacher
08:42 - or learning the basics of computer
08:46 - sciences I don't really want to be a
08:50 - computer scientist III but I I'm
08:52 - fascinated by coding and I want to have
08:55 - the ability to write code I don't think
08:57 - you know I don't think you have to you
09:00 - don't have to go into that as your major
09:02 - in college to care and I think that's
09:05 - that's the cool thing is that you guys
09:07 - are in middle school in high school now
09:09 - and you're already thinking about it
09:10 - you're already starting to understand
09:13 - that it that it exists and that it's a
09:17 - really powerful language that if you
09:19 - learn you have unlimited opportunity in
09:23 - any industry that you want to go into
09:25 - you know you can go into fashion with
09:28 - this skill set you can go into any
09:30 - industry and I think that's really
09:31 - empowering as a girl or as a boy but as
09:34 - a girl I think it's really cool if you
09:36 - know how to go great alright our fifth
09:41 - question is from westerly high school in
09:43 - Westerly Rhode Island very good hi we
10:03 - were wondering how deeply technology
10:05 - will impact daily life in the future how
10:11 - long I wish I had a crystal ball because
10:15 - I would make some investments in those
10:17 - companies that are going to disrupt the
10:19 - world and you know III think it's it's
10:23 - been really exciting to live in New York
10:26 - City
10:27 - where so much is happening so many
10:28 - companies are here building a building
10:32 - sort of taking an idea and building it
10:35 - out into an app or into you know a
10:38 - business that is transforming how we
10:41 - live and you know III don't know how
10:46 - where we'll go but I just know that we
10:49 - are the next generation and we are the
10:53 - ones that you know it's with this
10:56 - ability to speak this language and to to
10:59 - take an idea and build it into a product
11:05 - or an app or you know it's it's like a
11:10 - superpower you know having this ability
11:12 - is is you can do anything and so I don't
11:17 - know I think um I I think that it's
11:21 - impacted my daily life quite a bit and
11:23 - that's why I'm taking interest in you
11:26 - know even just understanding how it's
11:29 - written and it's really cool because I
11:31 - you know living in New York City even
11:34 - though I work in the fashion industry
11:35 - I've been able to meet and talk with a
11:37 - lot of different founders of Instagram
11:40 - of Twitter of snapchat you know I've met
11:44 - all the people that have difficulties
11:46 - companies and I'm fascinated by that I'm
11:50 - fascinated by them I think that um and
11:52 - and they're normal people just like us
11:53 - you know and I think that's the really
11:55 - cool part is that you know we we can
11:59 - build anything you know with just
12:02 - understanding
12:03 - learning how to speak this language and
12:06 - I think that's really really kind of a
12:10 - superpower in my opinion right our sixth
12:14 - question is from Alden school in Duxbury
12:17 - Massachusetts hi you've been all over
12:25 - the world modeling and you've met all
12:27 - kinds of people from different
12:29 - backgrounds how do you think learning
12:31 - code helps to connect us all as a world
12:34 - community you're right I've traveled
12:41 - when
12:44 - switches and it's hard to communicate
12:47 - you know even just getting around so
12:50 - over the last eight years I've traveled
12:53 - to Paris quite a lot for my job and I've
12:57 - learned French along the way which is
12:59 - you know just completely transformed my
13:03 - ability to connect and speak with people
13:05 - and I think the interesting thing is
13:08 - again you know Ruby you know I'm
13:12 - learning to code Ruby and like I can
13:15 - write something in Ruby that somebody in
13:17 - Paris somebody in Tokyo you know can can
13:21 - read as well you know and and build off
13:24 - of its this universal language that I
13:28 - think almost even simplifies I
13:31 - connecting with people around the world
13:33 - in a way that is really exciting because
13:36 - it means that together as a global
13:39 - community we can build things by
13:42 - actually even working together even if
13:44 - we don't speak the same you know English
13:48 - or a French you can you can work
13:50 - together to build something using code
13:53 - and I think that that's that's pretty
13:56 - cool all right our last and seventh
14:00 - question is from school crow Valley High
14:03 - School in leesport Pennsylvania hi my
14:12 - name is Genesis eight Ron what what are
14:16 - you most proud of accomplishing thus far
14:19 - in your career um I I actually really
14:27 - lucky to have the job that I have I
14:29 - really like my job um mainly because it
14:32 - it gives me an opportunity to do cool
14:35 - things like this hang out with you guys
14:37 - on a Thursday morning uh you know you
14:40 - guys are in classrooms all around the
14:42 - world are all around the country at
14:43 - least and I'm sitting in my kitchen even
14:45 - though we're having technical
14:46 - difficulties it's still pretty cool
14:48 - that we can connect and I really I think
14:52 - the coolest part of of my career is that
14:54 - I feel like I
14:58 - get to see I get to see firsthand the
15:02 - impact that technology is having on for
15:05 - instance my job and my industry and but
15:08 - also through this job that I have in
15:12 - these platforms like Instagram or
15:14 - Twitter or Facebook I can use that to
15:17 - talk about things or that that interest
15:20 - me and that I think are important to
15:22 - share like how powerful this skill set
15:26 - is to be able to to be able to write
15:30 - code and if nothing else to even just
15:32 - know that it exists you're really
15:38 - beautiful by the way all right well
