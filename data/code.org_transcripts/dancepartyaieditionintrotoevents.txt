00:07 - hi I'm Hannah and I'm a software
00:08 - engineer at code.org choreographers give
00:11 - dancers directions on exactly when to do
00:13 - a dance move in dance party you'll use
00:16 - code to direct your dancers to move when
00:17 - you want them to so how do you do this
00:20 - think of a situation where you do
00:22 - something like press a doorbell and then
00:24 - something else happens the doorbell
00:26 - rings when coding your dance party you
00:28 - can use events to make your program
00:30 - respond to a key you press for example
00:33 - you can code an event in your dance so
00:35 - when the up key is pressed your dancer
00:38 - does a dab or maybe when the down key is
00:42 - pressed a different dancer does the star
00:44 - events are like many dance sequences
00:47 - that aren't connected to your main setup
00:49 - they stand on their own and the dancer
00:51 - only responds with the dance moves you
00:53 - coded when you press the right key on
00:54 - the keyboard be careful when choosing
00:57 - dance moves make sure the dancer you're
01:00 - cing is already on the stage if your
01:02 - dancer isn't there they won't get the
01:04 - command to dance so what kind of dance
01:07 - will you queue up press run hit those
01:10 - keys and watch your dancer
