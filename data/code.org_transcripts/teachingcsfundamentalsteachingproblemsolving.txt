00:09 - one important thing you can do to help
00:10 - your students succeed with the cs
00:12 - fundamentals course is to encourage them
00:14 - to develop their own problem solving
00:15 - process
00:17 - a metacognitive approach to tackling
00:19 - complex problems is something your
00:20 - students can rely on again and again as
00:22 - their computer science studies become
00:24 - more difficult
00:25 - at code.org we like to teach a four-step
00:28 - problem-solving process which we call
00:29 - the puzzle solving recipe
00:31 - step one understand the problem
00:34 - when introducing a puzzle on code studio
00:36 - or a challenge in an unplugged lesson
00:38 - help your students deeply understand the
00:40 - problem before they begin to solve it
00:42 - this can be done by asking students to
00:43 - restate the problem in their own words
00:45 - or make connections to problems that
00:46 - they've solved in the past
00:49 - step two make a plan
00:51 - before your students attempt a solution
00:52 - have them create a strategy for how they
00:54 - will get there what steps will they need
00:56 - to take and in what order
00:58 - step 3 perform and perfect the plan
01:01 - now have your students put their plan
01:02 - into action while they're working
01:04 - through their strategy and encountering
01:05 - obstacles remind them to revisit their
01:07 - initial understanding of the problem let
01:09 - them know that it's okay to make changes
01:11 - to the plan as needed and don't let them
01:13 - give up persistence is the key to being
01:15 - a successful computer scientist
01:17 - step four check your work
01:19 - once they've solved the problem have
01:21 - your students go back and check their
01:22 - work then talk through the
01:24 - problem-solving experience with the
01:25 - class
01:26 - what did they learn about computer
01:27 - science from this specific problem and
01:29 - what did they learn about problem
01:30 - solving in general
01:32 - scaffolding cs fundamentals puzzles and
01:34 - lessons in this way helps your students
01:36 - experience success with the challenging
01:38 - content
01:39 - additionally these problem solving
01:40 - strategies are not just relevant to
01:42 - computer science problem solving is a
01:44 - skill that can be used to tackle
01:45 - challenges in any aspect of your
01:47 - students lives
01:48 - how do you scaffold problem solving in
01:50 - your classroom tell us on twitter at
01:52 - teach code
