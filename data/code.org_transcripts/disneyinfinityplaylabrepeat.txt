00:00 - Can you imagine if you had to repeat something
forever and ever? Hopefully you'll never have
00:06 - to because computers are really good at repeating
things. This is the "repeat forever" block.
00:13 - Anything inside this block will happen forever
in the game. So if we wanted an actor to do
00:17 - something repeatedly without the player having
to do anything, we'll put those blocks inside
00:22 - the "repeat forever" block. In this next puzzle,
our goal is to help Anna walk up and down
00:28 - continuously. Learning how the repeat commands
work will save you a ton of time later when
00:33 - you build your own game.
