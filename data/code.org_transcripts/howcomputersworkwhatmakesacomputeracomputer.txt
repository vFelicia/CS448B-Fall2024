00:02 - ﻿[Music] [Title: HOW COMPUTERS WORK: 
WHAT MAKES A COMPUTER, A COMPUTER?] 
 
00:05 - May-Li: My name is May-Li Khoe and 
I’m a designer and an inventor. So,  
00:10 - some of the things I’ve designed have been at 
Apple, and now I design products for kids to use  
00:15 - so that they can have an easier time in school. 
My other jobs include DJing and dancing. [Music]  
00:25 - Computers are everywhere! They’re in 
people’s pockets; they’re in people’s cars;  
00:31 - people have them on their wrists; they 
might be in your backpack right now.  
00:36 - But what makes a computer a computer? 
Nat: What does make a  
00:39 - computer a computer anyway? 
May-Li: And how does it even work? [Music] 
 
00:45 - Nat: Hi, I’m Nat. I was one of the original 
designers of the Xbox. I’ve been working with  
00:51 - computers since I was maybe seven years old, and 
now I work on virtual reality. [Music, laughing]  
01:07 - As humans, we’ve always built tools to help 
us solve problems: tools like a wheelbarrow,  
01:12 - a hammer, or a printing press, or a tractor 
trailer. All of these inventions helped us with  
01:18 - manual work. Over time, people began to wonder 
if a machine could be designed and built to help  
01:23 - us with the thinking work we do, like solving 
equations or tracking the stars in the sky.  
01:29 - Rather than moving or manipulating physical things 
like dirt and stone, these machines would need to  
01:35 - be designed to manipulate information. [Music] 
May-Li: As the pioneers of computer science  
01:41 - explored how to design a thinking machine, 
they realized that it had to perform four  
01:45 - different tasks. It would need to take input, 
store information, process it, and then  
01:54 - output the results. Now this might sound simple, 
but these four things are common to all computers.  
02:02 - That’s what makes a computer a computer. 
Nat:  
02:07 - The earliest computers were made out of wood 
and metal with mechanical levers and gears.  
02:13 - By the twentieth century, though, computers 
started using electrical components.  
02:17 - These early computers were really large and really 
slow; a computer the size of a room might take  
02:23 - hours just to do a basic math problem. 
[Music] Old timey announcer:  
02:27 - These machines are things 
of gleaming, varied metal  
02:30 - and numerous flashing lights. 
May-Li: Computers started out  
02:34 - as basic calculators, which was 
already really awesome at the time,  
02:38 - and they were only manipulating numbers back then. 
But now we can use them to talk to each other; we  
02:43 - can use them to play games, control robots, and do 
any crazy thing that you could probably imagine. 
 
02:49 - Nat: Modern computers look nothing like 
those clunky old machines, but they still  
02:54 - do these same four things. 
[Music] [Title: INPUT] May-Li:  
03:02 - First, we’re going to talk about input. This is my 
favorite because what input is, is the stuff that  
03:08 - the world does—or that you do—that makes the 
computer do stuff. You can tell a computer what to  
03:13 - do with a keyboard; you can tell them what to do 
with a mouse, the microphone, the camera. And now,  
03:18 - if you’re wearing a computer on your wrist, it 
might listen to your heartbeat. Or, in your car,  
03:23 - it might be listening to what the car is doing. 
And a touch screen can actually sense your finger,  
03:28 - and it takes that as input on what it’s doing. 
[Music] [Title: STORAGE & PROCESSING] Nat:  
03:36 - All these different inputs give a computer 
information, which is then stored in memory.  
03:42 - A computer’s processor takes 
information from memory;  
03:45 - it manipulates it or changes it using an 
algorithm, which is just a series of commands;  
03:49 - and then it sends the processed information back 
to be stored in memory again. This continues until  
03:55 - the processed information is ready to be output. 
[Music] [Title: OUTPUT] Nat:  
04:03 - How a computer outputs information depends 
on what the computer is designed to do.  
04:07 - A computer display can show text, photos, videos, 
or interactive games—even virtual reality! The  
04:13 - output of a computer may even include signals 
to control a robot. And, when computers connect  
04:18 - over the internet, the output from one computer 
becomes the input to another, and vice versa. 
 
04:23 - May-Li: The computers we use today look really 
different from the earliest thinking machines,  
04:30 - and who knows what the computers of tomorrow 
will be like? My hope is that you get to help  
04:34 - decide what you want the computers of tomorrow to 
look like. But across all computers, regardless  
04:39 - of the different types of technology they use, 
they’re always doing the same four things. They  
04:44 - take in information, they store it as data, they 
process it, and then they output the results.
