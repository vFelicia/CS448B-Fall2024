00:01 - All the sprites in your big game are now animated.
00:10 - But nothing happens when they run into each
other.
00:13 - We're going to use collision detection to
find out when sprites have touched each other
00:18 - so that we can later apply rules like increasing
or decreasing your score when your sprites
00:23 - collide.
00:24 - Using the provided line-length function, you
will complete a function distance that uses
00:29 - the distance formula to calculate the distance
between the center points of two sprites.
00:35 - Next you'll update the collide function to
use the distance function.
00:39 - If the distance between two sprites is less
than 100 pixels, the sprites are close enough
00:45 - to be touching and the collide function should
return true.
00:50 - If everything works, you'll see that when
the player collides with the target, your
00:54 - score increases.
00:56 - And when the player collides with the danger,
your score decreases.
