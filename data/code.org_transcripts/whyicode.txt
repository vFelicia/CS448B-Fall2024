00:10 - my name is Luna Ruiz I am a senior in
00:13 - high school and I live in New York City
00:15 - I was one of those kids that my mom
00:18 - would tell me don't touch the fire I I
00:21 - was obedient I wouldn't touch the fire
00:22 - but I'll probably throw stuff at it and
00:24 - make a bigger fire I was always very
00:25 - adventurous and curious that's why I got
00:28 - into computer science cuz I was always
00:30 - curious about how things worked well
00:33 - other than computer science I'm into
00:36 - things like sports I'm a serious athlete
00:39 - I play volleyball softball and
00:42 - basketball I'm really competitive as you
00:45 - can see I'm like
00:52 - compe sometimes I go to sleep very late

01:09 - think CS is hard at the beginner stage
01:12 - like it's really easy to get get started
01:16 - and it's cool to create things I have
01:20 - the power to be a producer not so much a
01:23 - consumer all the time I think CS is
01:26 - mostly problem solving thinking
01:29 - logically and and thinking outside of
01:32 - the box when I say that I mean literally
01:35 - starting from scratch like having to
01:37 - make a new idea I think that's applies
01:40 - to basically everything like I think if
01:43 - someone doesn't know what they want to
01:44 - do in their career I think they should
01:46 - take
01:50 - CS
