00:05 - using the data visualizer tool in app
00:07 - lab we can also make scatter plots
00:09 - scatter plots are useful for answering
00:10 - questions about relationships between
00:13 - variables or attributes in your data set
00:15 - first we'll want to choose scatter plot
00:17 - from the drop down
00:20 - and let's start with some variables that
00:22 - we've looked at before
00:23 - and the x values will look at the total
00:25 - percent of female
00:27 - test takers
00:28 - now if i wanted to know about the
00:30 - relationship between the percentage of
00:32 - female cs test takers in a state and the
00:35 - percentage of schools in that state that
00:38 - offer an ap program i could make this
00:40 - scatter plot
00:43 - now this scatter plot shows along the
00:44 - x-axis the total percent of female test
00:47 - takers and on the y-axis the percentage
00:50 - of schools in a state that offer an ap
00:52 - program
00:53 - each dot represents a particular state
00:56 - so for example we can see that this
00:58 - state right here
01:00 - had 38 percent of the schools in that
01:01 - state offer an ap program and 29 of the
01:05 - test takers in that state identified as
01:07 - female
01:08 - by looking at this entire graph we can
01:11 - see what if any relationship exists
01:14 - between these two variables
01:16 - we can also use the filter tool at the
01:18 - bottom
01:19 - to narrow down our investigation
01:23 - let's say we're interested in looking at
01:25 - only states where a large amount of
01:27 - tests were taken
01:29 - let's say two thousand
01:30 - we can choose the appropriate value here
01:33 - total apcs exams
01:36 - we can choose greater than or equal to
01:40 - and then we'll find the first value
01:42 - that's larger than two thousand here two
01:44 - thousand two hundred and fifteen
01:47 - now this graph still shows the same
01:49 - variables it's just that we're looking
01:50 - at only the states where there were 2
01:53 - 000 or more cs tests taken the last type
01:57 - of visual we can make is a cross tab
01:59 - cross tabs are useful
02:01 - for looking at data sets that involve
02:04 - some values that are strings instead of
02:06 - numbers so for this type of
02:08 - visualization let's look at another data
02:11 - set
02:16 - this data set comes from the publication
02:18 - the root and contains information about
02:20 - the 100 most influential
02:22 - african-americans
02:25 - after we import it we can look at it
02:27 - here
02:30 - let's say
02:32 - we wanted to get a sense of the most
02:34 - common type of people included in this
02:37 - list maybe with respect to
02:39 - the sector that they're in and their age
02:43 - we can choose those two variables here
02:45 - for our x
02:46 - and y
02:47 - values
02:48 - and now you'll see this table that shows
02:51 - up
02:52 - each of these values here in different
02:54 - shades of blue show the frequency at
02:57 - which these different combinations
02:58 - showed up so for example we can see here
03:01 - that in this entire data set four of the
03:04 - people on this list are age 39 and work
03:07 - in the community sector and we can see
03:09 - that that's the most combination out of
03:11 - all the possible combinations in this
03:12 - data set there are any number of
03:14 - possible questions you can investigate
03:16 - using these visualizations from
03:18 - understanding the variability in your
03:20 - data set to starting to uncover patterns
03:23 - and relationships in the data
03:25 - these visualizations will help you gain
03:27 - insight into topics that are of interest
03:29 - to you and are important to you
