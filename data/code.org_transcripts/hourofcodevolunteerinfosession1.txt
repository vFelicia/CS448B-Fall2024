00:00 - we are getting started with our first
00:01 - volunteer info session if you're an
00:04 - engineer or work with computer science
00:07 - in your day to day and you volunteer to
00:09 - sign up technology with the RF code this
00:11 - session is for you right now we're just
00:14 - sharing a few links in the sidebar that
00:16 - will be helpful for you we're going to
00:17 - share the agenda what we'll be talking
00:19 - about today and you can add sanu ghal
00:22 - doc you prefer back to at any time and
00:24 - we will also be sharing the link that
00:27 - teachers are using to find volunteers
00:31 - you can see how you're getting matched
00:32 - live on the website so to go through a
00:36 - few items just to get a sense but we're
00:38 - going to chat about we're going to go
00:40 - over how to coordinate with a teacher in
00:42 - your area what to bring to your hour of
00:45 - code what to do at your classroom
00:47 - session is it step by step and how you
00:51 - can further engage other people
00:53 - companies like your company or friends
00:55 - and we will then go to a Q&A session you
01:00 - can see on the right sidebar that we
01:02 - have an option for you to submit
01:03 - questions so after we go through our
01:06 - discussion and then we'll answer
01:08 - questions as you submit them so first
01:12 - and foremost we wanted to start with how
01:14 - do you get connected with the volunteer
01:16 - so everybody here hopefully has already
01:18 - signed up at code.org / volunteer and
01:21 - you should see in our showcase sidebar
01:24 - the link which is coded org slash
01:26 - volunteer / local and that is the map
01:29 - teachers are using to find volunteers so
01:31 - your address whatever address you gave
01:33 - up gave us is showing up as a pin on
01:36 - that map and teachers can select those
01:39 - pins um then they'll fill out a contact
01:42 - form so probably some of you have
01:44 - already received emails from teachers so
01:47 - what you need to do next is reply to
01:49 - that email what you'll want to follow up
01:52 - with is just to reiterate your name your
01:56 - company your job description or if
01:58 - you're a student where you're studying
02:00 - and what you're studying um please
02:02 - provide the days and times you are
02:04 - available to volunteer at the school and
02:07 - it'd be great to share just a little
02:08 - blur but why did why did you sign up to
02:10 - volunteer what's exciting about
02:11 - computers
02:12 - to you what do you want to share with
02:13 - students and then you'll need to ask the
02:16 - teacher what paperwork you need to fill
02:18 - out for the school before you volunteer
02:20 - so the point that you reply to the
02:22 - teacher you can see you are then
02:24 - directly working with that teacher to
02:27 - work with their school and it is your
02:29 - responsibility to work with the future
02:31 - work with the school to find a day and
02:33 - time that works for you if I love the
02:35 - paperwork you need to fill out and we're
02:37 - really excited to be launching this
02:38 - volunteer program but at code.org we
02:40 - don't have the capacity to handle any
02:43 - individual volunteer requests so it's up
02:46 - to you to work with school to set that
02:48 - up before you even arrived at the school
02:51 - is a few things you need to fill out so
02:53 - almost every public school is going to
02:55 - ask you to submit a background check and
02:58 - there might be other paperwork or formed
03:00 - you to fill out as an outside volunteer
03:03 - coming in so you'll need to work with
03:05 - your teacher they might need to ask
03:06 - their principal or administrator what
03:08 - forms they do need to fill out and
03:11 - you'll also want to confirm before you
03:13 - show up with your teacher the day and
03:15 - time you'll be at the school if you're
03:17 - just going to show up for one hour of
03:19 - class if you're going to show it for
03:20 - multiple class periods that day if
03:23 - you're going to an assembly that's all
03:25 - stuff you'll want to set up before and
03:27 - then it's important to establish
03:28 - expectations with the teacher before you
03:30 - arrive of what you'll be doing so we
03:32 - really set up this program as a way to
03:35 - inspire students to keep learning and so
03:37 - it's important that teachers recognize
03:39 - that your role as a volunteer is much
03:40 - more on the side of being a mentor and
03:43 - showing how students can learn and
03:45 - really a less emphasis on providing
03:48 - technical help for the hour of code the
03:50 - RF code is really easy to do teachers
03:52 - love it students love it we're happy to
03:55 - have volunteers answer questions but we
03:58 - really want to help students and
04:00 - teachers learn how to do this themselves
04:02 - so when you go to your hour of code what
04:05 - should you bring um one thing we
04:07 - recommend is that if you're coming from
04:08 - a company it could be great to bring
04:10 - some swags if it's stickers or handouts
04:13 - from your company to share with students
04:14 - students younger tips especially really
04:16 - love stickers your doesn't want to think
04:19 - about in terms of talking points what is
04:22 - your store with computer time
04:24 - and what entire you to learn the first
04:26 - time and why do you continue to stay
04:27 - engaged now let's we're going to move to
04:31 - they of what to do during your classroom
04:34 - visit so at this point you should have
04:36 - established with your teacher what time
04:38 - and day you'll be at the school at that
04:41 - time and day you'll need to sign in at
04:43 - the front office and greet the teacher
04:44 - you'll want to go over your schedule for
04:46 - the day and maybe confirm any talking
04:49 - points um want to spend 5 to 10 minutes
04:52 - talking about computer science so
04:54 - introduce yourself and your story what
04:56 - do you do with computer science in your
04:58 - job or when your studies and maybe share
05:01 - an anecdote of why did you say why what
05:04 - what was the first computer science
05:05 - class you took what was your first
05:06 - exposure why did you decide to keep
05:08 - learning what do you love about your job
05:10 - what kind of opportunities has computer
05:12 - science given you we have a link in our
05:16 - agenda doc which is linked to our
05:18 - inspirational hour of code videos so
05:21 - that's a video you could show to the
05:22 - classroom and then after that brief
05:24 - interruption you'll want to just dive
05:26 - into the tutorials so the tutorials are
05:28 - available at code.org / learn as you may
05:32 - have seen we have some pretty exciting
05:33 - new tutorials this year including Star
05:36 - Wars and then just today we announced
05:38 - minecraft so what people want to work
05:41 - with students through those tutorials
05:43 - make sure that they're learning on their
05:45 - own pace and so you're there to provide
05:47 - support and to answer questions but we
05:49 - really want students to be learning this
05:51 - themselves and then finally what we
05:54 - really like to see is help help how our
05:57 - volunteers can engage even more
05:59 - volunteers so right now we have about
06:01 - 700 sorry seven thousand volunteers
06:05 - signed up but we have seventeen thousand
06:08 - teachers who are still looking for
06:09 - volunteers and so any support we can get
06:11 - from our volunteer community and
06:13 - engaging even more people would be
06:16 - phenomenal so we've got a sample email
06:18 - in this document where you can send that
06:21 - to your co-workers and send it to your
06:23 - boss if you're at a CS program at a
06:25 - university share with your entire
06:26 - department and that's where we can
06:30 - that's how we can recruit even more
06:32 - volunteers so this is a broad overview
06:37 - and that we will be right back okay we
06:40 - actually like to introduce hi acres yeah
06:42 - i mean you come on Jordan um Hadi poor
06:45 - toby of course our co-founder and CEO
06:47 - and Alice Stein glass one of our product
06:50 - managers for our product and engineering
06:52 - team yeah yeah that's what is that roll
06:55 - over everybody hi so we were just going
07:00 - over the road overview of what to do as
07:03 - a volunteer how to connect with the
07:04 - teacher what to do when you sign up and
07:06 - haunting I'll come show a little bit
07:08 - more about why we're introducing this
07:09 - program this year and well you take it
07:12 - from them yeah sure at yeah the goal the
07:15 - hour of code is to get tens of thousands
07:18 - of teachers to try computer science in
07:20 - some format in their classroom and most
07:22 - of them are doing it for the very very
07:23 - first time and their count taking the
07:25 - leap of faith of trying this new field
07:27 - and we've given them tutorials that make
07:30 - it really really easy to do and in fact
07:32 - if you spend just five minutes looking
07:33 - at the tutorial you realize that you can
07:35 - probably wing it and your kids will have
07:37 - a great time have but it's still useful
07:39 - to have somebody there and back up just
07:42 - in case you can't and in fact each of
07:44 - our tutorials have some levels they get
07:46 - difficult enough that somebody might get
07:48 - stuck like if you needed to do a for
07:50 - loop with an if statement inside it
07:52 - that's a concept that people have
07:53 - trouble learning the very first time so
07:55 - I think somebody technical who's run
07:56 - through the tutorial once in advance is
07:58 - really useful the such as their comments
08:01 - with teachers yeah brought in college
08:03 - yeah I remember last year going into the
08:04 - classroom but the teachers like I am
08:06 - really afraid to teach this because I
08:08 - don't know about computers and I don't
08:10 - know what's going to happen and you know
08:12 - but you know before we started she was
08:14 - like okay okay you got it you got it you
08:17 - know are you are you going to make sure
08:18 - there are things okay now halfway
08:20 - through she was fine I bet is how we
08:22 - were done she said to me hey I just
08:24 - teaching after school club with this so
08:25 - it's not actually that intimidating once
08:28 - you get going but having you there
08:29 - knowing that you're a tech person or
08:31 - that you can do it is is it gives a ton
08:33 - of confidence the teacher that this is
08:35 - going to be okay and it might take a
08:36 - teacher who wouldn't have done it and
08:38 - just pushed over the edge so they're
08:40 - like I can do this is my classroom just
08:41 - because you're there so yeah absolutely
08:43 - that confidence is really important yeah
08:45 - the other thing that's super valuable is
08:47 - having if you're attending
08:49 - person in your classroom or via at video
08:52 - conferences helping brought in people's
08:55 - view of the importance of computer
08:57 - science and coding where people
08:59 - stereotypes are that coding is first of
09:03 - all their computer science is only about
09:04 - coding they don't realize that it's
09:06 - about cybersecurity or data analysis or
09:09 - you know network architecture design or
09:12 - those types of things people stereotypes
09:14 - ulcers that this is a field for genius
09:16 - white men they don't realize that you
09:18 - can participate in it regardless of your
09:21 - gender or background and you don't need
09:23 - to be a genius to do the most basic
09:26 - stuff and then the third stereotype is
09:28 - that computer science is basically about
09:29 - websites apps and games they don't
09:32 - realize that it's used for you know soil
09:35 - analysis for agriculture or you know if
09:39 - all that all the banks of the world run
09:41 - on computer systems all
09:43 - telecommunications is run by software
09:45 - own you know helping robbing people
09:47 - sense in general of the importance of
09:49 - computer science in tomorrow's world is
09:52 - something anybody can talk about if
09:53 - you're familiar with tech and if you can
09:55 - bring a personal story about it that
09:57 - also helps a lot because kids can't
09:59 - really quite imagine what it's like to
10:01 - work day to day in a tech company or in
10:03 - a text fear or do be a student in a
10:06 - university program one thing I found
10:08 - really helpful with that was playing a
10:10 - video at the beginning there's a whole
10:12 - bunch of videos online their list is
10:13 - inspirational videos and you can see
10:15 - them right the beginning of the
10:16 - tutorials there's a page on the new
10:19 - tutorials on Star Wars of my cat both
10:20 - know the page of videos you can play and
10:23 - sometimes you get in front of a
10:24 - classroom you don't know what to talk
10:26 - about right I want to say and play the
10:28 - video the kids get really excited
10:30 - because they see you know people they
10:32 - know or you know last year I had a bunch
10:34 - of kids all scream like she here out of
10:36 - the junior came on the street and that
10:38 - was fun and it was exciting for them and
10:40 - then being able to play off of that
10:42 - afterward if you know relate some of the
10:44 - things that they were talking about the
10:45 - things I had done in my job was cool and
10:47 - just gave me a starting point to and you
10:50 - know also just the classroom management
10:52 - or if you play video that it forces the
10:53 - gifts to sit down and be quiet and watch
10:55 - something which is you know helpful with
10:58 - a classroom full of students so that's a
11:00 - great way to get started and you
11:03 - to talk about very long I mean I don't
11:04 - think the at the end of the day you want
11:06 - the Deaf time to actually do the
11:07 - experience so you know three minutes
11:10 - five minutes that's a perfect amount of
11:12 - time to tell them a little bit about
11:14 - what you do there's a question there
11:18 - from Oscar I think saying I signed up as
11:21 - a volunteer but I've actually receive
11:23 - any information on how to select the
11:25 - actual school or their time to volunteer
11:26 - on what we're doing is rat where we've
11:29 - made a map where schools can see the
11:31 - volunteers and schools and teachers will
11:33 - actively reach out to you if you aren't
11:37 - reached out to that maybe because you're
11:38 - in a region where there's either more
11:40 - volunteers than teachers who want
11:42 - volunteers I guess that's the only
11:44 - reason is either more volunteers or not
11:47 - enough teachers participate in yeah but
11:49 - the way we want this is for those
11:51 - schools to reach out to the volunteers
11:52 - we aren't giving any of your email
11:54 - addresses to them they have a form where
11:55 - they can type in stuff and you'll
11:58 - receive an email without your emailed us
11:59 - being disclosed that if you want to
12:01 - respond then you can connect directly
12:03 - with the teacher adamant if nobody
12:05 - reaches out to you at other option fact
12:08 - is to just find a local school and try
12:10 - to convince them to post an hour of code
12:12 - and offer your help and letting them do
12:14 - that you know the way the hour of code
12:16 - spreads from school to school is partly
12:18 - from teacher word of mouth but partly
12:20 - from people from the outside just asking
12:22 - and offered help so if you're if you're
12:24 - not already tied up with an appointment
12:25 - to do this I encourage you to reach out
12:28 - to a local school and try to make it
12:29 - happen and so that multiple times
12:31 - they're pretty excited to hear like if
12:33 - you just reach out you know they
12:34 - probably don't know where to start so if
12:35 - you reach out to your local school of
12:37 - that could be a great way you know teach
12:39 - you a problem you thrilled if you say
12:40 - you're off you offer to do it for them
12:41 - and they may have already heard of the
12:43 - hour of code but not know how to do it
12:44 - themselves so that's really helpful when
12:47 - you reach out I think we have one
12:49 - related to them question about a local
12:50 - makerspace and that's another way of
12:52 - doing is if you have something like a
12:53 - makerspace it's so somebody's asking
12:57 - they have a they have an hour of code
12:59 - class at a local makerspace we already
13:01 - do several cody classes does anything
13:03 - special we need to do for the hour of
13:04 - code and you worked with maker spaces
13:06 - before and yeah I would definitely
13:09 - encourage you to just you know make an
13:11 - event of it you might encourage
13:12 - you don't normally come to your
13:13 - makerspace to come and bite the students
13:16 - who come to bring their friends or you
13:18 - know make it a special activity you can
13:20 - do one of the hours of code on are on
13:21 - our website or if you have a bigger
13:24 - space and you have a bunch of activity
13:26 - you can they go what would be a fun
13:27 - activity to do for an hour in your space
13:30 - thats related to coding it doesn't have
13:31 - to be something on the website you might
13:33 - have great ideas about how to use your
13:34 - makerspace for that our tutorials aren't
13:37 - the required thing to do they're just
13:38 - recommended and fun and awesome if you
13:41 - want to use them and you can do
13:42 - something that you make up yourself as
13:43 - long as it teaches computer science or
13:45 - conviction of thinking or robotics or
13:47 - anything and everything yeah you can
13:50 - also if you want to with your makerspace
13:51 - of I do one where we can do anything on
13:53 - the website but we print out the
13:56 - certificates afterward for all the
13:57 - students and this is place in the
13:59 - website you just go ahead and print out
14:00 - the certificates for all the students
14:02 - whether or not they did this particular
14:04 - tutorial or that particular tutorial and
14:06 - the kids got a blast out of taking their
14:07 - certificates off to show their parents
14:09 - that they dunk hour of code and you can
14:11 - also register your makerspace is being
14:13 - an hour code event so you know you can
14:16 - go ahead and do that as well if you do
14:18 - want to print out a certificate that's a
14:19 - cut out our / certificate and the
14:21 - teacher should have that link to if they
14:23 - don't have it you should let the teacher
14:24 - know that they can't print down
14:25 - certificates for any student /
14:27 - certificate / certificate yeah um we
14:32 - also have another question from Oscar so
14:34 - I didn't receive a link to the Hangout
14:36 - we're on right now except you saw up for
14:38 - YouTube you can check if you're
14:39 - registered correctly if you go to the
14:41 - volunteer map I shared a link in the
14:43 - showcase that's coated or splash
14:45 - volunteer / local and if you search for
14:47 - the location that you entered then you
14:49 - should see your own pin show up and
14:51 - that's how teachers will be contacting
14:53 - you so if you can't find yourself on
14:54 - that map something might be wrong please
14:56 - do send us email at info add code org
14:59 - for indoors or were you register on
15:02 - co.org / volunteer and try again and see
15:05 - if uh if your pic shows up on the map um
15:08 - you should also have received an email
15:11 - after you signed up and that will that
15:14 - should verify that you have signed up
15:15 - correctly so just sit tight if you
15:17 - haven't received an email from teacher
15:18 - yet or reach out to a local school
15:21 - did you finish going through the agenda
15:23 - anything else you want to do I don't
15:25 - think so so just to reiterate on this
15:27 - agenda will be shared on earth how to
15:30 - code our code calm / how to / volunteers
15:34 - will share this agenda which has sample
15:36 - emails a review of what to do to prepare
15:38 - for a classroom you can refer back to it
15:41 - and we just really like to emphasize
15:42 - that we still have almost 10,000
15:45 - teachers looking for engineers in 10,000
15:48 - years who've not yet signed up so please
15:50 - share this with your friends with your
15:51 - company with anybody you know who might
15:53 - be interested in volunteering I know
15:56 - there's a set of the beginning but
15:57 - making sure you're familiar with at
15:59 - least one of our tutorials and that
16:02 - you've run through it from front to back
16:03 - is really important you know you don't
16:06 - need to use one of our tutorials but at
16:08 - it would be unfortunate to show up in
16:10 - our class and the teacher doesn't know
16:11 - what to do and you don't know it's
16:12 - bigger bigger than so and if you're if
16:15 - you don't already have a planet with
16:16 - what you'd like the kids to be doing at
16:18 - either the minecraft tutorial or the
16:20 - Star Wars tutorials that coded or just
16:22 - released in the last week are both
16:23 - fantastic there are also new this year
16:26 - so if you have kids who have done the
16:28 - our code before you can make sure no one
16:30 - in the class has done it which is a
16:31 - great place to start then one benefit of
16:33 - the Star Wars tutorial is that it lets
16:35 - you use either drag and drop coding or
16:37 - JavaScript and we've done classroom
16:40 - testing the JavaScript coding gets
16:42 - challenging quickly kids have trouble
16:44 - with syntax that they you know they'll
16:46 - miss capitalized or forget to use
16:49 - parentheses for semicolons and
16:51 - especially when they're defining
16:52 - functions knowing how to close the curly
16:54 - braces and what goes where they have
16:56 - trouble with eyeshadow semicolons but
16:59 - having somebody actually knows how to do
17:01 - that stuff in the classroom that makes
17:02 - it much more likely to the classroom
17:03 - actually tries the JavaScript version at
