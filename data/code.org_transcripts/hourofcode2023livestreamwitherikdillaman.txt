02:28 - together you can do it on your own as
02:30 - well
02:31 - so navigate if you're going to follow
02:33 - along go ahead and go to code.org and
02:36 - when you get to the homepage you're
02:38 - going to see this up at the top the hour
02:40 - code is here dance party AI Edition to
02:42 - get into the dance party you're going to
02:44 - click see what's new the teal button and
02:47 - you can see we got a bunch of cool songs

03:06 - take a look at some of that
03:17 - together hi my name is mural Codi and
03:20 - I'm a dancer software developer and
03:23 - creator of
03:25 - illuminate computer science relates to
03:28 - creativity in numerous ways immeasurable
03:31 - really I mean once you have the ability
03:34 - to write software you can put ideas into
03:36 - anything I do it with light suits
03:39 - there's so much you can do once you have
03:41 - the tools to write software and it's the
03:44 - possibilities are really
03:46 - endless over the next hour you're going
03:49 - to get started with computer science and
03:51 - artificial intelligence by coding your
03:54 - own dance party we've assembled some hip
03:56 - music and a team of great dancers for
03:58 - you to play with
04:02 - all right so that's what we're going to
04:03 - be doing together uh we're going to be
04:04 - creating this dance party um whenever
04:07 - you get to these screens uh there are
04:09 - going to be 10 different levels for you
04:12 - to navigate through in order to navigate
04:14 - between them you can use this bar at the
04:16 - top or you can press this continue
04:19 - button down at the bottom and that's
04:20 - what I'm going to do right now so when I
04:22 - press that it's going to bring me here I
04:24 - need to select my age you go ahead and
04:26 - do that as well and then I'm going to
04:29 - click okay it's going to bring me to a
04:31 - screen that looks like this this even
04:33 - though you can't tell that there's a
04:35 - very hip dance party about to happen in
04:37 - the screen it is it's all behind the
04:39 - scenes and it's ready to go so first
04:42 - things first let's take a look up at the
04:45 - top where it says instructions now I'm
04:47 - going to drag this down a little bit see
04:50 - the cat here and it says add blocks to
04:51 - create your dancer and code them to do a
04:54 - new dance move click run to start
04:58 - dancing now
05:00 - where do I begin well luckily there is a
05:03 - popup right here that says start here so
05:05 - that's going to give me a clue as to
05:06 - where to begin I'm going to click the X
05:08 - to get rid of that and I need to create
05:11 - a dancer so I'm going to grab this red
05:14 - block that says make a new cat at Center
05:18 - and I'm going to drag that I'm going to
05:19 - click and drag that block and I'm gonna
05:23 - drop it over here into where it says
05:25 - workspace now I can drop it anywhere but
05:28 - in order to make the answer appear I
05:30 - need to drop it in the middle of this
05:33 - setup block and when I do that you'll
05:35 - notice that magically this cat appears
05:38 - over on the side now I get it maybe
05:42 - you're not a cat person maybe you prefer
05:45 - sloths so if you were to click this box
05:49 - where it says cat I can you can actually
05:52 - select a different dancer so in this
05:54 - case I'm going to select
05:55 - sloth and now over here um you'll notice
06:01 - that my cat is up here and he says click
06:03 - Start or click run to start dancing but
06:07 - he also has this little um light bulb
06:10 - above his head so I'm GNA click that and
06:13 - it's gonna say hey do you want a hint so
06:15 - anytime you get stuck trying to get
06:18 - through one of these levels you can
06:19 - always click that cat and the cat will
06:21 - give you a hint so it says the dancer
06:24 - should be the same on both blocks and
06:26 - the sequence is important ah because not
06:28 - only did I create a dancer in this case
06:31 - the sloth I need to make that sloth do a
06:34 - dance move so I'm going to drag this
06:35 - next block over I'm glad that I read
06:37 - that hint and it says the dancers should
06:41 - be the same on both blocks so I selected
06:43 - the sloth up here down here it's the cat
06:46 - need to make sure that I select sloth
06:48 - down here and then this is the fun part
06:50 - one of the fun Parts is I get to choose
06:53 - all these different moves I of course am
06:55 - going to choose the floss because that
06:57 - is how I start my Monday every morning
06:59 - flossing both you know with with my
07:03 - teeth and also dancing so let's give it
07:05 - a try I'm going to click run this orange
07:08 - run button over here and let's see what
07:10 - [Music]
07:15 - happens all right and once four seconds
07:19 - have gone by it's going to automatically
07:21 - say yes you passed the level and I'm
07:24 - going to click this continue button to
07:26 - move on to the next one all right so
07:29 - let's take a look at um some more about
07:32 - dance party AI edition let's learn a
07:35 - little bit
07:37 - [Music]
07:43 - more hi my name is hen and I'm head of
07:47 - the music search platform at Amazon I
07:50 - lead the team at Amazon music that helps
07:52 - you find your favorite songs we use
07:55 - Advanced computer technology like
07:57 - artificial intelligence to make sure
08:00 - when you need music
08:02 - recommendations we give you the perfect
08:04 - match artificial intelligence or AI is a
08:07 - computer program that works like human
08:10 - brains it takes a lot of data learns
08:13 - patterns from the data and makes
08:15 - decisions based on what it has learned
08:19 - AI wow okay so this is what we're going
08:23 - to be doing then we are going to be
08:26 - using this block over here
08:29 - which will actually use artificial
08:32 - intelligence to help us make decisions
08:35 - about the song that we choose and it
08:38 - will based on what kind of we interpret
08:41 - the song to be it's going to suggest a
08:45 - background that we can use that will fit
08:47 - the mood of the song so what I'm going
08:49 - to do I'm going to read the directions
08:51 - again that's always important right up
08:53 - at the top it says AI can help you
08:55 - create fun visual effects for your dance
08:57 - party so connect the the AI generate
09:00 - effect block to the setup and you'll
09:03 - notice up here now I have a new block
09:05 - under the block section it says generate
09:07 - blank effect so I'm going to drag this
09:09 - over I'm going to drop it here and it
09:13 - says click on the Block to get started
09:15 - so that's what I'm going to do I'm gonna
09:16 - hover over here and I'm G to click and
09:18 - it's going to bring up our code.org
09:21 - aibot and a whole host of emojis so we
09:26 - have to based on the song that we choose
09:29 - select three emojis that we think fit
09:31 - the mood so I'm actually going to come
09:34 - over here and look at what songs we have
09:36 - available so ah I really like lizo so
09:40 - I'm gonna select lizo and I can preview
09:43 - what that's going to sound like by
09:45 - pressing this play button next to
09:50 - it oh definitely all right so I'm going
09:53 - to click here and it's going to say
09:55 - based on what you heard with this song
09:58 - based on the mood that you you feel like
10:00 - the song conveys which of these emojis
10:03 - do you think best fit well I think that
10:08 - lizo was is definitely very sparkly so
10:12 - I'm going to put the sparkles in there
10:13 - uh she's definitely a queen and I don't
10:17 - know she's kind of like I don't know her
10:19 - songs are like diamond they go platinum
10:21 - diamond level right like she's she makes
10:24 - the hits so I'm going to put that and
10:25 - then I'm going to click the generate
10:27 - button let's find out what happens right
10:29 - now the brain of the AI is going through
10:32 - billions of combinations trying to
10:34 - figure out which of these
10:37 - particular uh which of these um
10:40 - backgrounds that are available fit these
10:41 - emo these emojis the best and this is
10:43 - what it came up with right here so I'm
10:46 - gonna click use effect down here and
10:49 - that's going to put it into my dance
10:52 - party and let's click run and see what
10:54 - happens
10:58 - now
11:04 - all right we did it moving on to our
11:08 - next
11:10 - level all right we have a moose and it
11:14 - says connect the AI generate effect
11:17 - block to setup and click on the Block to
11:19 - get started very similar to what we did
11:20 - in the last level so let's click on the
11:22 - cat here and see if it has any other
11:24 - tips for us or
11:26 - hints do you want a hint yes okay okay
11:29 - it says listen to the song and think
11:30 - about the mood of the music so let's
11:32 - choose a different one let's just let's
11:35 - try something different will I am all
11:38 - right let's listen to
11:41 - that really electronic it's got like a
11:45 - b all right oh there's some drums all
11:49 - right let's drag this block over one
11:52 - more time remember that you can select
11:56 - anything that you want up here so if you
11:57 - don't want a moose and you rather have a
11:59 - bear you can select the bear if you
12:02 - don't want the bear to be in the middle
12:04 - you want the bear to be at the bottom
12:06 - you can select where you want to
12:08 - position that that dancer so I'm put
12:10 - this bear at the bottom and the other
12:12 - thing is if you change your dancer here
12:15 - we also have to remember to change our
12:17 - dancer here as well so that the the
12:20 - dancer does the dance that we ask it to
12:23 - and I'm going to select uh how about
12:25 - clap High let's do that and when I click
12:28 - here that will I IM song I don't know
12:30 - it's it's it's got a cold beat to it
12:32 - it's pretty cool uh it's kind of robotic
12:36 - right it's like electronic music and
12:39 - what else I don't know like I'm gonna
12:42 - select this growing plant because I feel
12:45 - like as the song goes the beat is going
12:46 - to keep on growing and growing and
12:48 - growing so let's see what
12:51 - happens right now again the AI is just
12:53 - searching through billions of
12:54 - combinations trying to match the song
12:57 - with the emojis that I chose and this is
12:59 - what it came up with so what we're going
13:01 - to do is Click use
13:04 - effect and let's give it a
13:07 - [Music]
13:15 - try all right we did it again okay I
13:19 - think we got a handle on how to use the
13:21 - AI block to be able to create background
13:25 - so let's get a little bit more in depth
13:28 - then let's take a look at this video and
13:31 - find out a little bit more about how the
13:33 - AI Works behind the
13:36 - [Music]
13:40 - scenes how do you think AI Works can it
13:44 - read your mind is it magic is it
13:47 - randomly
13:48 - guessing actually AI knows quite a lot
13:52 - AI looks at billions of data points and
13:55 - finds associations between words with
13:57 - some simple math concepts applied
14:00 - billions of times it calculates the
14:02 - strength between those
14:04 - associations then AI uses what it
14:07 - learned in order to make decisions on
14:10 - what to generate for you my team all
14:13 - right so there is a lot going on behind
14:17 - the scenes that we're not seeing and
14:19 - that's okay we are going to use this
14:22 - block right here and we're gonna we're
14:24 - going to take a look first of all who
14:26 - likes BTS raise your hand if you do I
14:29 - know I do definitely good Monday morning
14:31 - music I'm going to click run here and
14:33 - just take a look at what is being
14:38 - generated all right and you'll notice
14:41 - here that once I clicked run a little
14:44 - message came up and it said you need to
14:46 - change the effect that the AI generates
14:49 - and you can either regenerate the effect
14:51 - you can customize the code that it
14:53 - writes or you can start over with new
14:55 - emojis so that's what the direction set
14:58 - up here so that when I clicked run I
15:01 - wasn't able to move on to the next level
15:03 - because I needed to do this step first
15:06 - so I'm going to click here in this box
15:07 - again it already has some emojis that
15:10 - are selected for me um we have the the
15:12 - chili guy we have the wave and we have
15:15 - the sparkle now if I don't like what's
15:17 - being generated here if I just don't
15:19 - think it fits the mood of the song I can
15:21 - click this regenerate button on the
15:22 - bottom left and that's what I'm going to
15:24 - do right now and again AI is going
15:27 - through all these different combinations
15:29 - it's finding associations it's making
15:32 - these connections and now it has uh fit
15:35 - it is selected this amazing Starburst
15:38 - pattern what if I want to see what's
15:40 - going on in the brain behind the scenes
15:43 - I can click this little graph icon in
15:46 - the upper right hand corner when I do
15:49 - that it's going to show me just just
15:52 - peer behind the curtain a little bit to
15:54 - let me know some of the choices that AI
15:57 - was looking at and why it selected the
16:01 - one that it did uh it's almost like
16:03 - voting um and AI is the one that's doing
16:06 - the voting in the situation and the way
16:09 - that it makes these decisions is that it
16:12 - trains itself to select which of these
16:16 - backgrounds best fit these emojis based
16:18 - on a ton of data and it looks at what
16:21 - students choose it looks at what
16:23 - teachers choose it looks at what it
16:26 - would choose and it uses all of this
16:27 - data to say this background must be the
16:30 - one so let's just go ahead and we will
16:35 - go back and we will say use effect right
16:38 - here and now when we run
16:43 - it stars
16:46 - [Music]
16:47 - are the thumbs up to move on to the next
16:51 - level so pretty
16:55 - fun all right let's take a look at some
17:00 - events what is an event let's find
17:03 - [Music]
17:09 - out hi I'm Hannah and I'm a software
17:11 - engineer at code.org choreographers give
17:14 - dancers directions on exactly when to do
17:16 - a dance move in dance party you'll use
17:18 - code to direct your dancers to move when
17:20 - you want them to so how do you do this
17:23 - think of a situation where you do
17:25 - something like press a doorbell and then
17:27 - something else happens the doorbell
17:29 - rings when coding your dance party you
17:31 - can use events to make your program
17:33 - respond to a key you press for example
17:36 - you can code an event in your dance so
17:38 - when the up key is pressed your dancer
17:41 - does a dab oh boy this is where some of
17:46 - the real fun begins we get to make
17:50 - events which as Hannah explained is when
17:54 - the program is listening for something
17:56 - to happen and in this case it's
17:58 - listening from input from you so that
18:01 - you actually get a say in what the
18:04 - dancer is doing and when they're doing
18:06 - it I see that there is a question about
18:11 - how do we change songs if you go up to
18:14 - the upper leftand corner where it says
18:16 - select song There's a drop down and you
18:19 - can see that every level that we go
18:22 - through this song list gets bigger and
18:25 - bigger and bigger it started with five
18:27 - songs and it looks like we're up to
18:29 - about 20 now um and so there's lots of
18:31 - choices in here if you can't find a song
18:34 - that you like just wait till the next
18:36 - level and there's probably going to be
18:38 - one that gets your foot tapping so I'm
18:41 - gonna hop in there Eric real quick
18:42 - because the share screen doesn't show
18:44 - the drop down but when you click on it
18:46 - you should see all of the choices there
18:48 - and as you click on them uh you need to
18:51 - click the play button to preview it so
18:52 - you can hear what that song sounds like
18:55 - uh but the next time you click run it
18:56 - will play the newly selected song song
18:58 - let us know if that didn't work in the
18:59 - chat and I'm happy to help you keep
19:01 - going yeah thanks so much da yep so yeah
19:05 - if you click this it'll it'll come up
19:06 - with a list of songs which unfortunately
19:08 - you weren't able to see but there are a
19:09 - ton there I promise you give it a try so
19:12 - in this situation let's read the
19:13 - directions again it says try it out you
19:16 - control the dance moves press run to
19:19 - start the song and then press the right
19:21 - or left Arrow to cue your dancers to
19:24 - move all right we have a couple options
19:27 - here if you'll notice that the bottom of
19:29 - the stage we see that there are some
19:31 - buttons with a left and a right uh
19:34 - button that we can click and will make
19:36 - the dancer move now in our actual stage
19:40 - over here you'll see that uh we have two
19:42 - new blocks that are green one says when
19:45 - left pressed so what do you think that
19:49 - means when you press the left button it
19:52 - will do what's below here and if you
19:55 - press the right button then and it'll do
19:59 - what's below this one so we can put
20:02 - different moves and assign them to
20:05 - different dancers so when the left is
20:06 - pressed the duck over here is gonna dab
20:10 - and when we press the right the dog is
20:13 - going to do the star I admit I don't
20:16 - know what the star is but I'm GNA learn
20:18 - um I can also press the right and left
20:22 - key on my keyboard if I'm using a
20:25 - keyboard okay so I'm going to click run
20:27 - and let's see what
20:31 - happens right left right
20:41 - right all right so you can see that uh
20:44 - you can have a lot of fun with that and
20:46 - this is how you basically get to help
20:51 - and interpret the dance and um be able
20:55 - to have it be seen on the screen so you
20:57 - are basically the dancer you become the
20:59 - dancer and again that AI block is up
21:02 - here and if you don't like the
21:04 - background that you see you can click
21:06 - here and and regenerate it all right I'm
21:10 - going to move on to the next level and
21:13 - in fact um I I'm GNA leave the the the
21:17 - the seven eight and nine for you but I
21:19 - want to jump to the last level uh so up
21:22 - at the top up here you can see I can
21:24 - kind of navigate through my levels here
21:26 - if I go to the last bubble right here it
21:28 - says final dance party Project screen
21:32 - 10 and in here this is kind of a free
21:37 - play level so I can uh essentially like
21:41 - there's going to be nothing that stops
21:43 - IT after 4 seconds to tell me to move on
21:45 - to the next level there are no
21:47 - instructions anymore this is me being
21:50 - able to take all of what I learned and
21:53 - experiment and get creative with my
21:55 - dance moves so again the the first thing
21:58 - I'm going to do is select a song at the
22:00 - upper left I'm just going to I'm going
22:02 - to oh Eno we don't talk about Bruno
22:05 - that's a good one can't go wrong with
22:07 - that and I can preview it if I
22:11 - [Music]
22:12 - want okay so you will notice and I don't
22:16 - want you to get uh too nervous about
22:20 - this but there are a lot of new blocks
22:22 - here you don't need to use all of these
22:25 - blocks they're just there to add add uh
22:29 - variety to add depth to add um just all
22:33 - the different things that you can think
22:35 - about they will help you to be creative
22:38 - and to create the perfect music video
22:41 - that you want but if you just want to
22:44 - focus on the blocks that you learned
22:45 - about in the level you can do that as
22:48 - well so here we already have an AI
22:50 - generating an awesome background effect
22:52 - but if I wanted to change it I could
22:55 - remember uh it says I'm going to going
22:58 - to make 12 cats new cats in a circle
23:01 - what do we make them uh let's put them
23:03 - in a diamond shape behind our main
23:06 - dancer right here and what if I want I
23:09 - don't know how about a shark let's do a
23:11 - dancing shark uh in the center let's put
23:14 - him in the in the or her I think it's a
23:16 - her in the bottom left yeah there we go
23:19 - now if I preview this this is what I'm
23:21 - goingon to
23:23 - [Music]
23:24 - see oh I don't know that might be a
23:26 - little too slow
23:28 - how about how about uh Kelvin Harris
23:31 - there we
23:33 - go good um if I want to include these
23:37 - events down here I can drag out these
23:41 - green event blocks right here and what
23:44 - if I were to put in a couple different
23:47 - directions here and I can make my
23:51 - dancers do dances when these different
23:55 - keys are pressed so there's a b B I
23:58 - don't know what a Bend is but I'm going
23:59 - to learn uh how about a clap high and

24:52 - for the whole length of it you can
24:54 - customize it however you want totally
24:57 - encourage you to play around the part of
25:00 - the fun of computer science and using AI
25:03 - to create these experiences is that you
25:06 - get to Showcase your creativity and I
25:09 - can't think of a better way to spend an
25:11 - hour than playing around with some of
25:14 - these blocks over here and seeing what
25:16 - you can create there is no wrong answer
25:20 - everything that you create and every
25:22 - Visual and every dance move is your
25:25 - creation and it will be amazing
25:28 - so thank you so much for taking this

26:01 - well I have a couple different things in
26:04 - in this if I were to like select one of
26:06 - these emojis I'd probably have to go uh
26:10 - for the fire because I'm just a fan of
26:13 - like getting like up and moving and
26:15 - getting excited and fire brings the
26:17 - energy so I'm all About That Fire
26:20 - awesome and you know I'm realizing uh we
26:24 - we didn't hear a little bit about your
26:25 - background can you tell us you know how
26:27 - you got to co.org why you care about
26:29 - Computer Science Education oh goodness
26:32 - okay well it just so happens that like I
26:34 - do have um maybe a little story that I
26:37 - can share here so back when I was
26:40 - younger um my brother and I we were we
26:43 - were products of like there was there
26:45 - was this this amazing transformative
26:47 - moment where this thing called the
26:48 - Nintendo came out and we became
26:51 - convinced that we were going to like
26:53 - create our own uh video game system and
26:56 - we were going to to like make video
26:58 - games and Market it and sell it uh and
27:02 - so well I mean I I was like in charge of
27:06 - doing the programming even though I knew
27:07 - nothing about programming my brother was
27:08 - going to do all the electrical
27:09 - engineering uh create the system even
27:11 - though he had no idea about electrical
27:13 - engineering uh and one Christmas we
27:16 - ended up getting uh a Commodore 64 um
27:19 - which was that's that keyboard is what
27:22 - it looks like that was the whole
27:23 - computer um and I was like okay this is
27:26 - it this is my moment I'm going to learn
27:29 - how to like create a video game it's
27:31 - going to be amazing and I remember going
27:34 - to the library and I found this book uh
27:37 - that's kind of like tucked away in the
27:39 - back corner it didn't look like a lot of
27:40 - people had used it it was called
27:43 - creating adventure games on your
27:44 - computer and I was totally stoked about
27:46 - that I was like I am going to do this
27:48 - I'm going to take this home I'm going to
27:50 - create the the biggest adventure game
27:52 - according to Tim Hartnell master
27:55 - gamesman and uh this is what the screen
27:58 - looks like when you load up the
27:59 - Commodore 64 a little bit different than
28:02 - we're used to with like Windows and Mac
28:04 - OS and iPhones and Android and all that
28:07 - uh and I typed in I think maybe like 500
28:11 - lines of code into the computer and then
28:13 - the moment came and I pressed enter and
28:16 - I was like this is my moment to
28:19 - shine and I got uh I got an
28:23 - error and nothing happened and at first
28:27 - I was a little bit discouraged I'm not
28:29 - going to lie but I think it really
28:31 - taught me a valuable lesson that you
28:33 - should never give up if something is
28:36 - important to you and you're really
28:38 - interested in it that you should keep on
28:40 - pursuing it and so I did I kept on
28:44 - pursuing and by the time I got to middle
28:46 - school I had met some other kids that
28:49 - were interested in programming and we
28:51 - ended up creating um several different
28:55 - games um I'm going to put that in quot
28:57 - ation marks games then certainly nothing
28:59 - like you would play now um but we would
29:02 - create them and we would upload them to
29:05 - um well what was the internet back then
29:07 - and and so like you can still find some
29:10 - of them there to this
29:12 - day I love that we got a comment in from
29:15 - someone saying fun trip down memory lane
29:18 - thank you again so much for joining us

29:22 - dance parties if you get permission from
29:25 - your parents or your teachers show us
