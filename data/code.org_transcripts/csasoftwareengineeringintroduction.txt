00:10 - i'm emily my name is craig my name is
00:13 - ninja i'm eddie my name is andres my
00:15 - name is pan it's actually really cool to
00:17 - just sit down and see the amount of
00:18 - stuff that you can do with code the
00:19 - amount of problems you can solve every
00:20 - day a beautiful thing about computer
00:22 - science is that it's flexible and
00:24 - there's always multiple ways to solve
00:25 - the same problem it's just thinking
00:27 - about what is the simplest and most
00:29 - efficient way of doing things they're
00:31 - part of your goal isn't even necessarily
00:34 - having the best ideas it's about knowing
00:37 - when the best idea has come to the
00:39 - surface kind of an art form you know
00:41 - like it is it is art like code is art
00:42 - and everybody has a different style
00:44 - there's a lot of intersections between
00:46 - liberal arts and technology that makes
00:48 - it a lot of fun having just an idea just
00:50 - something from scratch and then going
00:52 - through the process of building that
00:54 - into reality working through the logic
00:56 - and then making it a product that
00:58 - someone else could use you can build all
01:01 - the worlds you can imagine in vr which
01:02 - is the reason i work in it software
01:04 - engineering is a tool to make users feel
01:07 - or experience or just have an easier
01:10 - life in some way sitting at my office
01:11 - desk i can actually turn off the
01:13 - microwave at my home i get to be the
01:16 - software engineer that makes technology
01:18 - more useful for other people too and
01:20 - super exciting because we're creating so
01:23 - much and evolving every day computer
01:25 - science absolutely is collaborative by
01:27 - its very nature it has to be everybody
01:29 - has a different experience to bring to
01:31 - the table and diversity plays an
01:32 - important role in that you're able to
01:35 - have new experiences with people from a
01:37 - number of different backgrounds so it's
01:39 - definitely key for you to collaborate
01:40 - with others and it actually makes work a
01:43 - lot of fun when you do that nine times
01:44 - out of ten we're going to get the job
01:46 - done better as a team if you're doing it
01:48 - alone you might be doing it wrong
01:50 - there's always more to learn i will ask
01:53 - questions i uh i am not ashamed to say
01:55 - that i do not know you don't have to get
01:57 - it perfect the first time and don't be
01:59 - intimidated by getting started that's
02:00 - the really exciting part about
02:02 - technology is that it's always changing
02:03 - so you're always learning you're always
02:05 - having to stay on top of it but it's
02:07 - exciting so for me the passion comes
02:09 - from the ability that i'm empowering
02:11 - people the things i do now there's no
02:13 - way i would have ever dreamed of this as
02:15 - a kid i never imagined myself in this
02:18 - place and i'm very thankful for it every
02:20 - day i am never bored at my job like
02:22 - there's just an infinite amount of
02:24 - technology out there there's an infinite
02:26 - number of ways to solve problems anybody
02:28 - can do computer science i'm a software
02:30 - engineer i'm a software engineer i'm a
02:32 - software development engineer i am a
02:34 - software engineer i'm a senior software
02:36 - engineer i am a software engineer and
02:38 - you are a software engineer too
02:42 - [Music]
02:50 - you
