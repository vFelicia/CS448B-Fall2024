00:00 - Now that you have your simulation
running and have observed
00:03 - how maks and population
changes affect the spread of the virus,
00:07 - it's time to think
more like a scientist.
00:11 - In the next part of the activity,
00:13 - you'll see how things like recovering,
00:16 - chance, and vaccines can change
the outcome of each simulation run.
00:23 - Because the monsters show up
in random locations on your screen
00:27 - every time you click run, try clicking
reset
00:31 - and run a few different times
00:33 - and see what causes the virus
to spread quicker or slower.
00:39 - You can also start making predictions
00:41 - and collecting data before you hit run.
00:44 - What do you think will happen?
00:47 - After you press run,
how long does it take for
00:51 - half the monsters to get sick?
00:53 - What about all the monsters?
00:56 - Does it change every time you hit run?
01:00 - As you build your model,
01:02 - think about what
you might want to change.
01:04 - I suggest changing
only one thing at a time
01:08 - and comparing how each model changes
the simulation.
01:11 - Keep tinkering to find a good solution.
01:13 - You can share with Dr Monster.
