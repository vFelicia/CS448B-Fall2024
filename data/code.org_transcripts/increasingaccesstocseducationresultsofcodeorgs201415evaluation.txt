00:00 - welcome everybody my name is melissa
00:01 - jones i am a community manager here at
00:04 - code.org and i'm going to be your
00:05 - hostess this evening for our webinar
00:08 - tonight we're talking about how we
00:10 - increase access to cs education all
00:12 - across the united states what's working
00:14 - and what doesn't um we're using a
00:17 - platform called blue jeans for this
00:18 - webinar tonight
00:20 - blue jeans is a really great online
00:22 - communication platform but there are a
00:23 - couple things to keep in mind
00:25 - you can see us and hear us but we can't
00:28 - see or hear you so if you have a
00:30 - question or something that you'd like to
00:31 - bring up feedback anything you'd like to
00:33 - say the best way to do that is to use
00:35 - the chat window which is right above
00:38 - your webcam picture on the side of the
00:40 - screen if you click that there should be
00:41 - some flashing icons there now if you
00:43 - click that you can see the chat that's
00:45 - already going on and you can also
00:46 - introduce yourself put in your questions
00:48 - and put in your feedback there
00:51 - when um it comes time for q a and for
00:53 - discussion you can use your microphone
00:55 - and your video camera and the way that
00:57 - we are right now and you'll activate
00:59 - those right below your webcam picture um
01:02 - and i'll let you know when it's time to
01:04 - do that so no need to do that now if you
01:06 - do have your microphone on you may want
01:07 - to mute it so that we can reduce
01:08 - background noise
01:11 - so welcome this is the second in a
01:13 - series of five webinars we're going to
01:15 - be hosting this fall um last month we
01:17 - had a special q a session with hadi
01:19 - partovi the founder of code.org and this
01:21 - month we're really excited to have
01:23 - outlier in the house and pat our chief
01:25 - academic officer to talk about the
01:27 - results of our program evaluation
01:29 - i'll talk about the next upcoming
01:31 - webinars in just one second but what i
01:33 - wanted to do is just give you a brief
01:34 - overview of what we're going to be
01:35 - discussing tonight earlier this month
01:38 - code.org released our
01:41 - 2014-2015 program evaluation report um
01:44 - and so tonight we're going to get some
01:45 - information um about what's in that
01:48 - report and give you a chance to ask us
01:49 - questions about the data
01:51 - about the results about anything that um
01:54 - is striking your fancy after you hear
01:56 - about the results
01:58 - so our presenters tonight are pat
01:59 - youngpity who's the chief chief academic
02:02 - officer here at code.org and dr heather
02:04 - king who is an associate researcher at
02:06 - outlier hello
02:09 - and we're going to start out by telling
02:11 - you a little bit about why we did the
02:13 - evaluation work and what we were hoping
02:15 - to learn then we'll dive into the study
02:17 - design and review the findings pat will
02:19 - share some of our key takeaways from an
02:21 - organizational perspective and we'll
02:22 - have plenty of time
02:24 - for your questions and to discuss the
02:26 - results and really that's what we're
02:27 - mostly hoping to get out tonight out of
02:29 - tonight rather is a real dialogue about
02:31 - this evaluation and what it means not
02:33 - just for code.org but for the entire cs
02:35 - education community
02:37 - so i'm gonna hand it over to pat pat
02:39 - take it away
02:41 - thank you um
02:43 - so hi guys uh and melissa you can um go
02:46 - to the next slide
02:49 - great thank you uh so yes who i am um
02:53 - well i uh i taught for 13 years i'm
02:55 - actually a career educator folks um
02:58 - i uh taught for 13 years k through 12 a
03:01 - little bit of
03:02 - k but mostly middle school and high
03:04 - school and of that mostly computer
03:06 - science i've also taught middle school
03:08 - science as well so i'm a i'm a career
03:10 - educator meaning
03:12 - the information that you're getting from
03:14 - me is
03:16 - coming from a perspective of someone who
03:18 - understands what you guys are doing on
03:19 - the ground
03:20 - um so that's who i am and uh currently
03:23 - right now i uh lead the academic work at
03:25 - code.org and i'm specifically focused on
03:29 - um
03:30 - a project where we're creating a
03:32 - framework for k-12 computer science
03:34 - education and working with states all
03:36 - across the nation
03:46 - video coming through but um okay i'm
03:49 - gonna ignore that for now um
03:51 - so what is this about um
03:54 - well this is about
03:56 - what code.org learn
03:58 - and um uh
04:01 - uh through its first um
04:04 - year of implementation 2014-2015
04:07 - um so it's about
04:09 - understanding what how teachers um
04:13 - took to our professional development and
04:15 - our partners professional development
04:17 - um what they learned from it um how
04:20 - their attitudes might have uh changed
04:22 - because of it what happened in the
04:24 - classroom because of it it's about
04:26 - understanding what our
04:28 - how our district partnerships went and
04:30 - whether they actually move the needle in
04:32 - districts and how far they move the
04:33 - needle
04:34 - um it's also about understanding what
04:37 - students were learning in the classroom
04:38 - during these computer science
04:39 - experiences
04:41 - and lastly it's about
04:43 - understanding the impact of computer
04:45 - science on other subjects
04:47 - and so why do we do evaluation at
04:49 - code.org one of the things i'm i'm proud
04:52 - of at code.org is that we've been doing
04:55 - evaluations since the beginning even
04:57 - while we were trying to just figure
04:58 - things out folks um
05:01 - we were evaluating it right from the
05:03 - beginning um
05:05 - and for those of you guys who understand
05:07 - agile methodologies in terms of like the
05:09 - software industry or even just any other
05:11 - industry in terms of being agile we were
05:14 - quite agile in uh at the beginning of
05:16 - code.org
05:18 - trying to figure out how we wanted to
05:21 - um spread computer science education all
05:23 - across the nation
05:24 - and having our external evaluator
05:27 - outlier there right from the beginning
05:30 - helped us out a bunch and so it's not
05:32 - just evaluation in terms of
05:34 - judging and assessing
05:37 - the outcomes and um
05:40 - and almost like measuring
05:42 - uh code.org effectiveness it's not that
05:44 - type of evaluation it's more so
05:47 - all about program improvement and that's
05:49 - really uh why this is important why we
05:51 - do evaluation we just want to improve
05:53 - and we just want to meet our goal
05:56 - some people do evaluation because
05:57 - they're into research or they're doing
05:59 - experiments and it's about experimental
06:01 - design and what they find out and how
06:04 - they can inform the research community
06:07 - yes we're about that as well but really
06:08 - we're just about program improvement so
06:10 - that we can meet our goals better and
06:13 - what what it's not about and i just want
06:15 - to be clear about this is funding
06:17 - because
06:19 - none of our funding requires any kind of
06:22 - um
06:23 - external evaluation like we do and so
06:26 - really it's all about program
06:27 - improvement
06:28 - and why is it important for you guys
06:31 - you guys in the field teachers in the
06:32 - field and researchers out in the field
06:35 - for teachers it's about
06:38 - uh
06:39 - well getting better
06:40 - curriculum
06:42 - making sure that it's evidence and
06:44 - research backed
06:45 - so that when you use it with kids it
06:47 - works
06:49 - and for researchers we're studying the
06:51 - same stuff and so
06:54 - we've learned a lot from you and we hope
06:56 - that you can learn a lot from what we've
06:57 - done
06:58 - um and some of the stuff that we've
07:00 - looked at that we can't that we might
07:02 - not be looking at anymore we hope that
07:03 - you you uh take up
07:06 - um the torch
07:07 - and um study it further so that we can
07:10 - in turn benefit
07:12 - so
07:13 - that's the who i am what is this about
07:14 - and why it's important
07:16 - um so what did we want to learn um
07:20 - we wanted to learn
07:22 - a lot uh
07:24 - we
07:24 - we
07:26 - uh had a outlier evaluate
07:29 - all of our programs so i already talked
07:30 - about the the district partnerships i
07:32 - talked about
07:34 - um
07:35 - our professional development
07:37 - um
07:38 - in this in school year 2014-15 we had
07:42 - i believe five programs happening one
07:47 - let me count
07:48 - no four programs happening um at the
07:51 - elementary school level we had our cs
07:54 - fundamentals program which is actually
07:56 - composed of a number of courses that can
07:58 - be taught at the k5 level some of you
08:00 - guys on the column might actually be
08:01 - using them
08:02 - um
08:03 - uh the second program we evaluated was
08:06 - computer science and algebra which is a
08:09 - middle school program dedicated to
08:12 - integrating computer science into an
08:13 - algebra class for the purposes of
08:16 - learning algebra better
08:18 - we had a computer science in science
08:20 - program
08:21 - and
08:23 - that was the same thing as the algebra
08:25 - program but just for science
08:27 - those two programs just to be clear were
08:30 - actually created
08:32 - and uh run by
08:34 - our
08:34 - external partners folks who had been uh
08:36 - funded by the nsf for a long time
08:40 - and then
08:42 - we also had
08:44 - a program at the high school level
08:46 - called exploring computer science same
08:48 - thing code.org did not create exploring
08:50 - computer science uh it was created by a
08:52 - group called exploring computer science
08:54 - and they've been doing great work for a
08:55 - number of years before we teamed up with
08:57 - them to spread their great work
08:59 - all over the nation
09:00 - those are the programs
09:02 - this is uh what we want to learn
09:06 - let's go on to the next slide
09:13 - yes so
09:14 - i'm going to introduce our external
09:16 - evaluators outlier based out of the
09:18 - university of chicago center for
09:20 - elementary math and science education
09:22 - they are our external evaluator and for
09:25 - those you guys who don't
09:26 - aren't familiar with evaluation in a
09:28 - research setting an external evaluator
09:30 - works is a third party outside of
09:32 - code.org
09:34 - that has
09:35 - um more of a i guess the whole point of
09:38 - it is that they are neutral and
09:40 - um and that they can um
09:43 - look at and evaluate code.org's work uh
09:45 - from an objective standpoint not being
09:48 - um not being the ones who necessarily
09:50 - created the work and are executing on
09:51 - the work
09:52 - i'll pass it to dr heather king from
09:55 - outlier
09:56 - thanks pat i'm really excited to be here
09:58 - first of all i got to come to seattle
10:00 - and actually be physically present to do
10:03 - this and that's very exciting
10:06 - just to give you a little bit of
10:07 - background just like that said i'm from
10:09 - outlier research and evaluation at the
10:11 - university of chicago and we are a group
10:14 - of educators researchers anthropologists
10:17 - scientists
10:18 - artists
10:19 - uh we're very diverse and we
10:23 - have collectively been doing evaluation
10:25 - and research
10:26 - for
10:27 - i don't know how long genie has been
10:28 - doing it
10:29 - uh the director of our group but 20-plus
10:33 - years
10:34 - and we've been very excited to work with
10:37 - uh code.org for the past year and a half
10:40 - uh just as pat said we're also very
10:43 - interested in sharing findings and
10:46 - producing very actionable
10:49 - research and evaluation that can be used
10:50 - immediately so working with code.org as
10:53 - nimble and agile as they are is a great
10:55 - fit for us so
10:56 - thanks for having us here and thanks for
10:59 - letting us um
11:00 - present everything that we've done in
11:02 - the past year
11:03 - so i just wanted to go over really
11:05 - quickly some of the um methodology that
11:07 - we use just because i'm going to be
11:09 - referring to that and so you guys can
11:11 - understand what i'm talking about so
11:12 - first of all questionnaires these are
11:15 - surveys so a lot of multiple choice
11:18 - questions that we send out to teachers
11:20 - administrators this year we'll be
11:22 - sending to students also and
11:24 - when you get questionnaire findings you
11:26 - can you have a bunch of uh respondents
11:29 - so in the hundreds
11:30 - maybe your thousands if we're lucky and
11:32 - you can do statistics you can do things
11:34 - like that so you'll see things like you
11:36 - know on average participants rated xyz
11:40 - um five out of six and so that would be
11:44 - something from a questionnaire so when
11:45 - you're looking back at the evaluation
11:47 - report i think we have that url
11:49 - somewhere in here uh and you see
11:51 - something like that that's coming from a
11:52 - survey or a questionnaire we also have
11:54 - interviews so that's when we actually
11:56 - talk to people and we get really
11:58 - in-depth stories about what they've been
12:00 - experiencing and so in these in these
12:02 - two
12:03 - methods we're asking a lot of the same
12:05 - types of things so we ask about
12:06 - implementation like what's actually
12:08 - happening in the classroom we ask about
12:10 - attitudes like do you like computer
12:12 - science do you think computer science is
12:13 - important um we talk about their
12:16 - backgrounds and things like that but
12:17 - these are just two different ways of
12:18 - getting the same kinds of information
12:20 - and
12:20 - an interview is great for getting more
12:23 - rich details and really digging into
12:25 - somebody's story
12:26 - so when you look at the evaluation
12:28 - report online you might see quotes and
12:30 - you might see some of this more what we
12:32 - would call quantitative findings so
12:34 - that's just to give you a little bit of
12:35 - context about where those things are
12:37 - coming from okay so now let's get into
12:40 - the findings so we did a number of
12:42 - studies and i'm going to just look at
12:44 - each one of them
12:45 - very briefly because we want to get into
12:47 - your questions later on and if you guys
12:49 - want to look more in depth please go to
12:52 - the evaluation report
12:54 - um
12:55 - i don't know if we can see this
12:58 - but uh melissa has linked this to you
13:00 - guys maybe we can put that in the chat
13:02 - chat for that so that we can um have
13:05 - access to that and that's going to have
13:06 - much more in-depth findings i just want
13:08 - to go really briefly over because the
13:10 - studies that we did last year and what
13:12 - some of the major findings were
13:13 - okay so i want to start with the
13:15 - district leaders
13:16 - so code.org was very interested in
13:18 - understanding how their district
13:20 - partners were
13:22 - experiencing a partnership with them
13:24 - what sorts of
13:26 - feedback they might have about the
13:27 - relationship between the district and
13:29 - code.org and then we also wanted to get
13:31 - a sense of where the district was do
13:33 - they have plans in place for
13:35 - uh keeping computer science going over
13:37 - the long term do the people that we're
13:39 - talking with have value computer science
13:41 - do they think it's important things like
13:43 - that and then what's what's the greater
13:46 - community's feelings about computer
13:47 - science education so we wanted to gather
13:49 - all of that kind of information through
13:51 - interviews talking directly with
13:52 - district leaders and we talked with
13:55 - leaders in six regions broward county
13:57 - florida charles county maryland denver
14:00 - new york uh seattle and spokane
14:03 - washington
14:04 - and of course these were district
14:05 - leaders i'm just referring down to this
14:07 - little box in the corner
14:09 - that gives you a little bit about um the
14:11 - study and
14:12 - um who we who we spoke to and what's her
14:14 - grades we're talking about so as we move
14:16 - forward continue to look at that lower
14:18 - corner for that information
14:20 - so just some very high level findings
14:23 - for example uh when we talked to
14:25 - two district leaders we found that while
14:28 - the a lot of the times the individual
14:30 - that we were talking with they found
14:32 - computer science very important but
14:33 - maybe that wasn't shared
14:35 - with others in the district but when
14:37 - code.org came in that definitely
14:40 - increased the priority of computer
14:41 - science in all of the regions so
14:43 - everybody that we asked this question to
14:46 - said that code.org helped make computer
14:48 - science more of a priority in their
14:50 - district
14:51 - another thing that we discussed with
14:52 - them was how funding long term and how
14:56 - things like course credit are decided
14:58 - and almost always it was decided at the
15:00 - state level especially things around
15:02 - course credit and so that was another uh
15:05 - challenge that we all need to be aware
15:07 - of as we try to move towards
15:08 - sustainability of computer science
15:10 - education because sometimes when we're
15:11 - working with districts
15:14 - maybe these decisions are not up to them
15:15 - so states and other stakeholders are
15:18 - also important in these conversations
15:20 - about keeping computer science going
15:22 - over the long term
15:23 - and in that same vein
15:25 - all of the people that we talked with
15:26 - said that community input is very
15:28 - important for keeping computer science
15:30 - education going in the long term for
15:32 - sustaining that because you have
15:34 - industry and business in the community
15:36 - and they have a stake in how
15:38 - students in the local community are
15:40 - educated about computer science
15:42 - the k-12
15:44 - excuse me the higher-end organization so
15:46 - universities technical schools community
15:49 - colleges all of those people also have a
15:51 - stake in this so it's not just the
15:53 - schools themselves but it's everything
15:55 - around in the community and so all of
15:56 - those
15:57 - stakeholders need to come together over
15:59 - the long term to
16:01 - help keep computer science education
16:03 - going
16:04 - so if you want to learn more and for all
16:06 - of these that i'm talking about please
16:07 - go to
16:08 - the link that melissa just put into the
16:10 - chat
16:12 - and
16:12 - um
16:14 - yeah so that we can see the detailed
16:15 - findings there
16:16 - for now i'm going to move on to the next
16:18 - study that we did
16:20 - so the next study we did was looking at
16:22 - counselors and administrators so when i
16:24 - say administrators i mean school leaders
16:26 - so that's principals vice principals
16:27 - maybe instructional leaders others at
16:30 - the school who are considered
16:31 - in admin and counselors so these were
16:34 - all looking at high school
16:37 - high school admin and counselors
16:39 - and this was
16:41 - after a professional development the
16:43 - code.org put on for
16:45 - counselors and administrators in a
16:46 - handful of regions so again we have
16:48 - broward county florida boston
16:50 - chicago charles county maryland denver
16:53 - seattle and spokane so code.org held
16:56 - professional development for admin and
16:58 - counselors to get them oriented to what
17:00 - is computer science education in high
17:02 - school what does that look like and
17:04 - what's important about that
17:06 - and we surveyed them after so we asked
17:09 - them questions in a survey and we had 96
17:12 - respondents and one of the things that
17:14 - we found was that respondents believe
17:16 - that computer science was necessary for
17:18 - high school students so
17:20 - the majority agreed with that but that
17:22 - they felt less strongly that it should
17:24 - be required so that was interesting
17:26 - because it speaks to
17:29 - some of the things that we've found over
17:30 - the years looking at computer science
17:32 - education
17:33 - that
17:34 - people think it's important it's
17:35 - definitely something that people should
17:37 - be doing but when it comes to who should
17:38 - be doing it how should that happen
17:40 - that's where all of these discussions
17:41 - start so this was reflected in this
17:44 - finding that maybe not everybody thought
17:46 - that every single high school student
17:47 - should take computer science but they
17:49 - all felt that it was important
17:51 - and that the pd the professional
17:52 - development code.org provided influenced
17:54 - that so you'll see that in
17:57 - in the full report when you go online
17:59 - and look at that another thing that i
18:00 - thought was really interesting and
18:03 - speaks to
18:04 - uh
18:05 - how quickly computer science is is
18:08 - changing and how quickly computer
18:10 - science education
18:11 - is changing is
18:13 - this idea that a third of respondents so
18:16 - 29
18:17 - didn't feel that they had the resources
18:19 - necessary in the district to teach
18:20 - computer science courses
18:22 - so we didn't specify in the
18:25 - questionnaire
18:26 - what we meant by resources but we were
18:29 - talking about physical resources
18:31 - maybe they meant computers or
18:34 - curricula or space or teachers
18:37 - and because this was a brief survey we
18:39 - didn't get into all of the details but
18:41 - through the other things that we've done
18:43 - and the people that we've talked to not
18:44 - just for the code.org evaluation but for
18:47 - other studies on computer science
18:49 - education
18:51 - we've found a lot of different reasons
18:53 - that administrators might not feel that
18:55 - they are their schools are prepared to
18:57 - teach computer science so this is
18:58 - another issue to the field how can we
19:01 - address that
19:03 - okay
19:04 - i'm going to move on to the next study
19:08 - so the next study looked at the
19:10 - implementation of the cs fundamentals
19:12 - courses so again these are the k5
19:14 - courses there are currently four courses
19:16 - one of them course four is in beta but
19:19 - uh
19:20 - we've talked to teachers all over the
19:22 - country so
19:23 - not just in those regions that i talked
19:25 - about before but all over the country
19:27 - everybody that we could get to to
19:28 - respond to us basically
19:30 - we asked them both via questionnaires
19:33 - and via interviews we did 15 interviews
19:35 - with teachers across the country and we
19:37 - surveyed about 700
19:40 - plus
19:41 - elementary school teachers
19:44 - so we found a lot of different things
19:45 - there's quite a bit more in the online
19:47 - report so please go there to see more
19:49 - but some major findings that i just kind
19:51 - of skimmed off the top where
19:53 - teachers for example were very
19:54 - challenged by the fact that multiple
19:56 - grades you use each course so like i
19:59 - said there's four courses
20:01 - course one is intended currently for
20:03 - kindergarten and first graders course
20:05 - two for uh second and third and course
20:08 - four
20:09 - for um
20:11 - fourth and fifth grade and then we have
20:12 - this course four that i think was
20:15 - intended to be advanced and to be used
20:17 - by others that had gone through
20:18 - everything else but when we were talking
20:21 - to some of the elementary school
20:22 - teachers they were a little unsure about
20:24 - how to how to approach that because
20:26 - if you have students
20:28 - um in a mixed class or if you have a
20:30 - technology facilitator even who sees
20:32 - lots of different kids from lots of
20:34 - different grades they were needing to
20:36 - adjust their instruction based on the
20:38 - kids they had in front of them and so a
20:40 - kindergartner and a first grader are
20:41 - very different as i'm sure most of you
20:43 - or all of you know
20:45 - so they were having trouble
20:47 - using the same materials for different
20:49 - for different types of students so that
20:50 - was one thing that we brought back to
20:51 - code.org
20:53 - another thing that we learned from the
20:55 - study was that
20:57 - the co-daughter courses were very
20:59 - interesting to kids so all of these
21:01 - things that code.org has built in like
21:03 - the frozen characters like the flappy
21:06 - birds
21:07 - angry birds all that stuff kids were
21:09 - just really jazzed to be getting on
21:11 - code.org and they felt like it was a
21:12 - game and that's exactly what the
21:14 - intention was so hearing that and
21:16 - hearing some of the stories from
21:17 - teachers too about which students were
21:20 - engaged and which students were
21:21 - interested so
21:22 - it wasn't just the high achieving
21:24 - students it was sometimes there was a
21:26 - story that i i
21:28 - remember from a teacher about um
21:30 - a student who
21:32 - was very
21:34 - struggled a lot with reading
21:36 - and struggled a lot with literacy and
21:38 - was considered to be kind of one of the
21:40 - lower kids in the class but when it came
21:42 - to the programming and with the code.org
21:44 - lessons he was like at the top like he
21:47 - just got it he was figuring stuff out he
21:49 - was helping other kids
21:51 - and
21:52 - um that's a really good thing to know
21:54 - about which which sorts of kids are
21:56 - being reached by the code.org materials
21:58 - because as we all know this is a big
22:00 - goal of code.org is to get every kid
22:01 - involved so not just the high achieving
22:03 - goods
22:04 - another thing that we found was talking
22:07 - not just to teachers about the materials
22:08 - and how the kids were reacting to them
22:10 - but also the teacher training and
22:13 - now that teachers had had a bit of a
22:14 - chance to go through the materials
22:18 - what did they need what did they need to
22:19 - do this better so
22:21 - um as as i'm sure most of all of you
22:23 - know there isn't a lot of
22:25 - teacher training out there for computer
22:26 - science and the elementary grades so
22:29 - teachers had some challenges they wanted
22:31 - some more content support and they were
22:33 - very excited and grateful for the pd
22:36 - provided at the beginning of the year
22:37 - but as you go through and you know when
22:39 - you're in front of the kids you're in
22:40 - the classroom you need to figure some
22:42 - stuff out and you might you know things
22:44 - are coming up that you didn't anticipate
22:46 - so that was one piece of feedback that
22:47 - we got was that more content support
22:49 - would be great and there's some other
22:51 - pieces of feedback to you um that are in
22:53 - the online longer version of this
22:56 - okay so moving on to the high school
22:59 - courses
23:00 - so
23:01 - pat mentioned exploring computer science
23:04 - this is a curriculum that's out of
23:06 - california and there's been a group that
23:09 - has been
23:10 - developing this and implementing this
23:12 - and high schools down there for i
23:13 - believe six or seven years now so
23:15 - code.org partnered with them to bring
23:17 - this set of instructional materials to
23:20 - kids nationwide at the high school level
23:22 - and this is a very introductory course
23:25 - and it's intended to be focused on
23:28 - bringing high school students up to
23:29 - speed in terms of what is computer
23:31 - science what does that mean and then you
23:34 - get tastes of programming data
23:38 - all of these different fundamental
23:40 - computer science concepts
23:42 - so
23:43 - what we found
23:46 - in our other studies
23:48 - not just with code.org was that a lot of
23:50 - high schools teachers tend to pull
23:52 - together
23:54 - pieces of information to kind of build
23:55 - their own curriculum so that was one
23:56 - thing we're really interested in
23:58 - learning is do teachers even like
24:00 - teaching this way with a set of
24:01 - instructional materials that's all one
24:04 - thing it's complete and we found that
24:06 - they did a surprise
24:08 - especially since i think more than half
24:10 - of teachers that we
24:12 - talked to and again this is
24:13 - questionnaires and interviews and in the
24:15 - questionnaire i think 55 had never
24:17 - taught computer science before so i
24:18 - believe that this wasn't help to them so
24:20 - teachers like teaching computer science
24:22 - with a complete set of instructional
24:23 - materials like ecs
24:25 - uh with that said fewer than a quarter
24:28 - of responds were able to finish each
24:30 - unit of ecs and the time that it said it
24:32 - would take in the materials so
24:34 - not sure exactly what's going on and
24:36 - it's probably different in each case and
24:38 - of course it probably always takes
24:39 - longer to finish than the curriculum
24:41 - says but that's um
24:43 - something that we noted in the
24:46 - evaluation
24:47 - and another thing that we were really
24:49 - interested in this year was assessment
24:51 - because
24:52 - pat mentioned
24:53 - uh figuring out what students learned
24:56 - and that's something that we're going to
24:57 - look at in much more depth in this
24:59 - year's evaluation but we were really
25:01 - interested in understanding how teachers
25:03 - were trying to understand what their
25:05 - kids were learning so we asked a number
25:07 - of questions about assessment and only a
25:09 - quarter of respondents were totally
25:11 - confident in their ability to assess
25:12 - student learning and if you look at the
25:14 - long version of the report there's
25:16 - quite a bit more in there about the
25:18 - types of assessment that they used um
25:21 - the different you know avenues that they
25:23 - were trying to follow to get at student
25:25 - learning and then we have a bank of
25:27 - quotes directly from teachers in us in a
25:30 - survey we ask them to write out some of
25:32 - their concerns with assessment so that's
25:34 - in there too for you guys to look at and
25:36 - so
25:37 - um again go back to the longer report
25:39 - this is just like very high level um and
25:42 - i'm i believe that's the last slide for
25:44 - me
25:46 - and i'm really looking forward to
25:47 - getting your guys's questions in the
25:48 - chat pod when we get to that point
25:50 - because
25:51 - i really want to hear what you guys
25:53 - think and what questions you have and
25:54 - that can help us as we move forward with
25:56 - the evaluation too great and so just for
25:59 - folks who are watching the recording
26:00 - after the fact
26:02 - you can access these reports at code.org
26:05 - about evaluation
26:07 - or you can access the full report that
26:09 - heather is referring to at
26:11 - outlier.uchicago.edu
26:15 - evaluation underscore code org
26:19 - those are in the slides as well you'll
26:20 - see them throughout but just wanted to
26:22 - make sure people who don't have access
26:23 - to the chat pod get that
26:25 - um we did have one question that came up
26:27 - during your chat there heather if you
26:29 - want to address it now you can wait till
26:30 - later so grant would like to know
26:33 - in looking through the data that we have
26:35 - on professional development which was
26:36 - the first slide that you talked to
26:38 - 97 of the teachers that were surveyed um
26:42 - said that they felt prepared to teach
26:45 - code.org curriculum and actually i think
26:47 - this
26:48 - is from a study that you guys actually
26:50 - didn't conduct for us but maybe you
26:51 - could speak to the methodology grant
26:53 - wants to know um is that immediately at
26:55 - the end of the training did you follow
26:57 - up later around implementation how did
26:59 - you guys handle that in your study
27:00 - design yeah so i believe that 97 figure
27:04 - comes from
27:05 - a survey that was implemented or
27:08 - you know put out right after the
27:09 - training
27:10 - and so um i think that that's where
27:12 - that's coming from and that was what i
27:14 - was getting at when i was talking about
27:16 - the content support and other support
27:18 - that teachers named and how when you get
27:20 - in the classroom
27:21 - you know you feel super confident and
27:22 - that's so important because
27:24 - self-efficacy is so important for for
27:26 - teachers and and that is a predictor of
27:30 - success in other areas for sure so
27:32 - that's very important but as we all know
27:34 - when you're in the classroom and stuff's
27:36 - happening um and you're not an expert
27:39 - you know that that content needs to come
27:41 - in somewhere so so i guess to answer
27:44 - your question grant the 97 is right
27:47 - after and then when we asked later on
27:49 - after the school year uh was pretty much
27:51 - done we asked a similar question i'm
27:54 - just looking at the long report now to
27:55 - see if we have um
27:58 - an exact figure
27:59 - but uh
28:01 - the level of agreement dropped off and i
28:04 - think that that makes a lot of sense
28:05 - because this is a brand new thing like
28:08 - this has only existed for a year
28:10 - and again these elementary school
28:12 - teachers
28:13 - probably don't have a lot of experience
28:15 - with computer science that's something
28:16 - else that we that we asked about yeah
28:18 - and one thing i really liked about the
28:20 - evaluation design is we're collecting
28:22 - um immediately after this after the pd
28:25 - workshop is over how do you feel and
28:26 - people are feeling great in gung-ho and
28:28 - then we came back later with both
28:30 - surveys and interviews
28:33 - to get the real deal you know once
28:34 - implementation was going on so in the in
28:36 - the full report online you'll see
28:38 - um results of immediately after the pd
28:40 - workshop and then the implementation
28:42 - reports that point to what's happening
28:44 - during the school year yeah so i think
28:46 - when you look at our the outlier reports
28:48 - those are all of the things that happen
28:49 - after the fact and then i think some of
28:51 - the things on the code.org website like
28:53 - that 97 that is actually code.org data
28:56 - on the day of on the day of and so i'm
28:58 - just looking at the longer report now
29:00 - and it says that more than half of
29:02 - questionnaire respondents so that's 55
29:05 - someone disagreed or disagreed that they
29:07 - had all of the skills needed to teach
29:09 - computer science well so that's that
29:11 - difference after they've had a little
29:13 - bit of experience and i don't think
29:15 - that's necessarily bad i think that that
29:17 - just means that this is new and it's new
29:19 - to the teachers and that they need more
29:21 - support and i don't think that's a big
29:22 - surprise yeah the gap that we're finding
29:25 - is in their content knowledge too which
29:27 - is a hard thing to be fought
29:30 - uh okay i'm unmuted yeah uh i'll just
29:33 - add that um so the the question uh grant
29:38 - that was asked of these teachers is you
29:39 - know are they how you know i
29:42 - um i feel prepared to teach this course
29:44 - and then um they rate their agreement
29:47 - right um on a scale um
29:50 - and then the question asked uh later by
29:52 - outlier uh relates to
29:55 - um
29:57 - them having the skills needed to teach
29:58 - computer science
30:00 - well so slightly different questions
30:03 - where you know you know do i feel
30:05 - prepared and then at the end
30:07 - of their experience or somewhere towards
30:10 - the end of their experience actually in
30:11 - the classroom
30:12 - do i have all the skills required
30:16 - so
30:18 - nonetheless
30:19 - it's not a surprise that
30:21 - they feel you know really excited and
30:24 - they they think they feel prepared but
30:26 - then afterwards they find out that
30:28 - they're actually missing a lot
30:30 - and thus a lot of the
30:32 - a lot of the um
30:34 - recommendations that outlier made based
30:35 - on their interviews are around different
30:38 - content supports
30:39 - um ways to integrate the computer
30:41 - science content with the math the
30:44 - science the
30:46 - english language arts content that these
30:47 - elementary school teachers are already
30:49 - covering um
30:51 - a full course progression
30:53 - with more materials um
30:56 - lots of other stuff to help them
30:58 - feel more confident in the classroom
31:01 - hope we hope we address your question
31:03 - grant
31:04 - and please do continue to put questions
31:06 - in the chat pod we're going to have a
31:07 - specific
31:08 - portion of the agenda just for q a but
31:10 - we can of course pop in like this as
31:12 - well oh here is that url if you are not
31:15 - if you don't have access to the um chat
31:17 - room if you'd like to see the full
31:18 - report so we're gonna go back to cat now
31:21 - oh go ahead pat
31:22 - yeah you can go back to me actually go
31:24 - to the next slide melissa and and
31:26 - actually grant's having a great
31:27 - conversation about this uh i don't know
31:29 - who grant is but i think grant knows
31:32 - i think grant knows about professional
31:34 - development so this grant mentioned that
31:36 - for people on the video who can't see
31:38 - the chat grant mentioned that it sounds
31:41 - like um more follow-up pd is needed for
31:44 - these teachers and that's very true so i
31:47 - just want to point out that the k5pd is
31:50 - one day
31:51 - in person and there is no chance that an
31:54 - elementary school teacher who's never
31:55 - had a computer science experience
31:58 - has no computer science degree no
32:00 - computer science background has never
32:01 - taught computer science and might not
32:02 - have ever learned computer science ever
32:04 - in their life will be
32:06 - a um will be actually fully prepared
32:09 - they could feel fully prepared but being
32:11 - actually prepared which is what outlier
32:13 - asked is a totally different thing so
32:15 - follow pd
32:16 - guaranteed um
32:18 - and uh
32:19 - and
32:20 - folks like flavia who use the mickey
32:23 - makey and scratch and logo and lots of
32:26 - other things are kind of almost getting
32:28 - into it themselves which is wonderful
32:30 - um the the code.org pd is not meant to
32:33 - be a full solution it's meant to really
32:35 - spark
32:36 - um the growth
32:38 - of a uh
32:40 - of a of a novice computer science
32:41 - teacher but it's not supposed to be an
32:42 - end-all be-all so follow-up pd is
32:44 - definitely definitely needed
32:47 - um
32:48 - so yeah let's talk about more pd um
32:52 - so you see these
32:53 - uh results here um
32:56 - and you might be wondering what these
32:58 - two columns for k5 affiliate train and
33:00 - k5co.org trained are all about
33:03 - um
33:04 - well so in the beginning um and i told
33:07 - you guys we were very agile
33:10 - organization meaning we were
33:13 - very open to change and
33:15 - changing
33:17 - as we were executing on things as well
33:19 - well in the beginning we were thinking
33:21 - that we would run all of our k5
33:24 - professional development ourselves so
33:26 - with our own code.org trainers
33:29 - um we quickly decided that
33:32 - we wanted to
33:35 - try something different and work with an
33:38 - affiliate model which meant that we
33:40 - um
33:41 - contracted with a number
33:43 - of people all across the nation
33:46 - and trained them to train teachers so
33:48 - it's like a train the trainer model if
33:50 - you're familiar with that and thus the
33:52 - difference between the 176 features that
33:55 - code.org trained personally
33:57 - and the k5 affiliate trained teachers
34:00 - 9290
34:02 - that was as of june 2015
34:05 - um the k5 affiliate trained teacher
34:07 - number is now currently hovering close
34:09 - to 15
34:10 - 000 teachers which is quite amazing
34:13 - thank you to all of our k5 facilitators
34:16 - out there including alana aaron who's in
34:18 - the chat room right now these teachers
34:21 - out there who have full-time jobs
34:23 - have on their you know in their free
34:26 - time
34:26 - um
34:27 - feed
34:29 - hundreds and hundreds
34:30 - of teachers themselves adding up to a
34:33 - total of 15 000 teachers so that's quite
34:34 - amazing um and you're going to
34:37 - see in this chart that you're looking at
34:38 - right now in this slide
34:40 - that the
34:41 - professional development
34:43 - that code.org and its partners run is
34:46 - very well received
34:48 - um the lowest numbers you see here are
34:50 - in blue this was the best pd ever that's
34:53 - kind of um
34:54 - it's not the silliest question we ask
34:56 - but
34:57 - it's it's it it could seem kind of weird
35:00 - to you guys really the whole point of
35:01 - that was to you know people could be
35:04 - satisfied with the professional
35:05 - development but we wanted them to
35:06 - compare it to all the professional
35:08 - development they've ever had
35:10 - um
35:11 - and so the question was you know
35:13 - this was the best pd ever and they they
35:15 - answered that question on a scale of one
35:17 - to six they they expressed their
35:19 - agreement with that statement on a scale
35:20 - of one to six so um that's why you see
35:23 - those low numbers is because
35:25 - um
35:26 - uh
35:27 - you know it's a pretty strenuous high
35:30 - bar to reach best pd ever
35:32 - um
35:34 - so yeah so i mean this this chart right
35:36 - here is really just to show you that the
35:38 - the pd has been very well received i'm
35:40 - just going to call out one more thing
35:42 - before i move on to the next slide
35:44 - which is
35:47 - what else happened in the classroom in
35:50 - terms of the k5
35:54 - program
35:57 - teachers interviewed said that student
35:59 - enjoyment of computer science and data
36:02 - showing student learning
36:03 - would be the most influential
36:07 - factors in them deciding to teach
36:09 - computer science so basically if their
36:11 - students enjoyed it
36:12 - and there was actually data showing that
36:14 - students
36:16 - were learning um
36:19 - they would teach computer science that
36:20 - would convince them to teach computer
36:21 - science and so we're working on both of
36:24 - those
36:24 - uh fervently
36:26 - increasing the enjoyment factor when it
36:28 - comes to computer science and also
36:32 - making visible the data showing student
36:34 - learning and so we've actually hired a
36:36 - data engineer
36:38 - since this last report came out a data
36:40 - engineer as well as an internal
36:43 - uh learning scientist to help us um
36:47 - uh
36:48 - improve the student learning outcomes
36:50 - for all of our programs let alone the k5
36:52 - program let's go on to the next left
36:56 - and i'm going to go a little bit quicker
36:57 - here guys because heather already gave
37:00 - a great overview of these um
37:03 - of these areas of evaluation but i just
37:05 - wanted to kind of just chime in so
37:07 - district partnerships
37:09 - um
37:10 - co.org partners with a number of
37:11 - districts nationwide it was uh like 60
37:14 - or 70
37:15 - um
37:16 - as of june 2015 and now it's i don't
37:18 - know close to um
37:22 - 100 or or something like that i don't
37:24 - know it's on our website or something
37:25 - real really the point is is that uh we
37:28 - are addressing the issue of computer
37:30 - science education from the bottom and
37:32 - the top where the top here is at the
37:35 - district level
37:36 - creating course codes uh making sure
37:38 - that um there's someone kind of leading
37:41 - the charge in the district it's not just
37:42 - teachers all by themselves figuring out
37:45 - how to teach computer science and where
37:46 - to get computer science resources and
37:49 - how to fund their own professional
37:50 - development
37:51 - um and so that's really what the
37:52 - district partnership is all about
37:54 - um one thing that i want to call out i
37:57 - can't remember if heather called it out
37:58 - is sustainability
38:00 - um heather did you call talk about
38:02 - sustainability
38:03 - okay yeah so hey guys so this district
38:06 - partnership stuff it doesn't mean
38:07 - anything if um it doesn't lead to uh
38:10 - sustainable programs of computer science
38:12 - and so that's another reason why we
38:14 - engage the district in the first place
38:15 - because guess what if a teacher teaches
38:18 - computer science and kids are having a
38:20 - good time and the teacher leaves well
38:22 - then there's no more computer science so
38:23 - it has to really be institutionalized at
38:25 - the district level
38:27 - um and so we have plans to help
38:31 - districts make their programs and the
38:33 - effort that code.org has put in
38:36 - more sustainable and that's uh that's
38:38 - yet to be seen obviously because we'll
38:40 - we'll know whether we were successful
38:41 - three to five to seven years from now
38:44 - but we're definitely focused on that
38:46 - um
38:48 - next slide
38:51 - student learning outcomes okay so take a
38:53 - look at this slide folks
38:55 - this is about student learning outcomes
38:57 - but what you're seeing in this graph
38:58 - this table is just participation and i
39:02 - want to make clear that participation
39:04 - does not equal student learning big
39:07 - numbers does not equal kids actually
39:09 - learning computer science it just means
39:11 - accounts are created and they're doing
39:13 - something
39:15 - and what we have studied if you look at
39:18 - our website and click on the learn more
39:20 - under the student learning outcomes
39:21 - section
39:22 - we have studied
39:24 - students demonstration of certain
39:26 - concepts
39:29 - concepts like debugging sequencing loops
39:31 - conditionals nested loops etc
39:34 - our next step is to show
39:36 - actual learning and mastery because even
39:39 - demonstration of a concept is not
39:41 - necessarily
39:42 - learning learning requires an
39:44 - understanding of where they were before
39:46 - and where they are at the end of the
39:47 - treatment and so we're doing a lot of
39:49 - work around that
39:51 - and um but and the results are promising
39:54 - so look forward to that
39:56 - in our next evaluation report what did
39:58 - kids really really learn when it came to
40:02 - their experience with code studio
40:04 - uh
40:05 - another thing i just want to point out
40:07 - real quick is a
40:08 - programming test of transfer we did with
40:11 - our
40:12 - high school students and so they program
40:14 - in an environment called scratch with
40:16 - which many you guys know about
40:18 - we put them on a new environment to see
40:20 - whether their scratch programming skills
40:23 - transferred to a new environment and
40:25 - guess what it did with actually quite
40:28 - good results we're going to be backing
40:30 - up that study
40:31 - with a more
40:34 - rigorous study involving validated
40:36 - instruments this year so that was more
40:39 - of like a pilot study and
40:40 - the
40:41 - results are promising let's move to the
40:43 - next slide
40:44 - so pat just as you're transitioning i
40:46 - wanted to add that all of the student
40:48 - learning data in our evaluation report
40:50 - comes from code studio data which is
40:52 - gathered by us at code.org it was not
40:54 - part of our outlier evaluation study so
40:57 - just so that you're aware it didn't come
40:58 - from the questionnaires and interviews
41:00 - it came from another data set
41:02 - and as pat mentioned we've recently
41:04 - brought on board a data engineer and a
41:05 - learning scientist so we have
41:07 - tons of data and we're really excited to
41:09 - roll up our sleeves this year and dig
41:11 - into it
41:12 - yup hey i just want to mention something
41:13 - that flavia said about um how code.org
41:16 - is just a starting point you know flava
41:18 - uses scratching logo that's awesome like
41:21 - every teacher who's watching this video
41:23 - right now should understand that once
41:24 - again code.org is not a an endpoint it's
41:26 - not a full solution we're hoping that
41:29 - you guys do use scratch you do use
41:32 - um uh
41:34 - you know scalable game design out of the
41:36 - university of colorado we we hope you
41:38 - use app inventor we hope you use um
41:41 - tinker we hope you use all these
41:42 - third-party things because
41:44 - um they provide such a rich experience
41:46 - for kids so i just want to make that
41:47 - clear as well because i see this in the
41:49 - chat room i'm going to finish up with
41:51 - this program cost and wrap up the other
41:53 - things program costs i mean you guys can
41:54 - take a look at this later
41:57 - when you're working at national scale
41:58 - cost actually matters and so
42:01 - we believe that our costs are actually
42:03 - um quite good compared to other programs
42:06 - out there
42:07 - and it makes our ability to um scale
42:10 - a lot easier because our mission really
42:13 - is to bring computer science to every
42:14 - single student
42:16 - not necessarily code.org to every
42:19 - student but computer science to every
42:20 - student and we're just trying to play
42:21 - our part let's go on to the next slide
42:27 - all right connections to other subject
42:28 - areas all right so does computer science
42:30 - actually
42:32 - help learning in math and learning in
42:34 - science and other fields
42:36 - um this
42:37 - chart that you guys are seeing right now
42:39 - actually shows that there's quite a
42:41 - strong correlation between
42:43 - um taking computer science ap computer
42:46 - science in this case and doing better in
42:49 - a b calculus and bc calculus and
42:51 - statistics that's that's awesome that's
42:53 - wonderful um that's correlation not
42:56 - causation i just want to say that
42:58 - but there are studies being done right
43:01 - now to explore that further so basically
43:04 - a lot of promising results from
43:06 - folks like the college board and folks
43:08 - like bootstrap one of our partners in
43:11 - the cs and algebra program
43:13 - let's go on to the next slide
43:18 - here are up to date results
43:20 - scores out of a scale of six one to six
43:23 - from our workshops uh that happened
43:25 - summer 2015 so all this evaluation stuff
43:28 - we're talking about um is from um
43:32 - june 14 to june 15 this is june to july
43:35 - so this is hot off the presses
43:37 - the k5 has a little footnote that you
43:39 - don't see 14 000 teachers that's
43:42 - teachers total not the teachers that
43:44 - were pd'd
43:45 - in in summer 2015 that's like a
43:48 - cumulative total so things are going
43:50 - well and you'll see a a new program
43:52 - right here computer science principles
43:54 - uh it's our uh we piloted the pd and
43:58 - probably in the curriculum right now
44:00 - um and you'll see that it's being very
44:01 - well received by the 113
44:04 - teachers who have participated in the
44:05 - pilot
44:07 - i'm done with that slide
44:10 - great well thanks pat at this time we'd
44:12 - love to open it up for q a and
44:13 - discussion so what i'm going to do is
44:15 - i'm going to go ahead and minimize the
44:17 - slides on my side and ask you if you
44:19 - have a webcam tonight if you could turn
44:21 - it on we'd love to
44:22 - see your faces and actually have a
44:24 - discussion here so as people are turning
44:26 - their webcams on they should be lining
44:28 - up towards this bottom of the screen if
44:30 - that's not happening for you you can go
44:32 - ahead and at the bottom of your screen
44:34 - there's some toggle buttons where you
44:36 - can make the webcams bigger or smaller
44:39 - we're going to be using the chat pod to
44:40 - post questions or if you'd like to just
44:43 - kind of wave your hand in your webcam i
44:45 - can call on you and then you can unmute
44:47 - yourself and speak your question as well
44:49 - so i'm gonna go ahead and take a look in
44:51 - the chat pod to see if there's any
44:52 - questions but as we're warming up for
44:54 - that i wanted to ask um
44:56 - pat and heather like you guys have both
44:58 - spent a ton of time in this evaluation
45:00 - data from a bunch of different points of
45:02 - view um and i just would love to hear
45:05 - from each of you um you know
45:07 - what what are you most proud of what was
45:08 - the biggest piece of good news
45:10 - in what you saw
45:12 - what was most exciting to you and then
45:14 - what scared you most and what you saw
45:16 - what were you most concerned about so
45:18 - take that away and then anyone else who
45:19 - has questions put them in the chat pod
45:23 - honestly the thing that scared me the
45:25 - most was the finding that i
45:28 - addressed earlier from counselors and
45:30 - administrators saying that a good
45:33 - portion of them didn't think they had
45:34 - the resources
45:36 - and i you know i've heard that
45:38 - from a lot of different people in a lot
45:39 - of different places for example um
45:44 - i talked with some teachers in chicago
45:46 - and some of you might know that in
45:48 - chicago computer science
45:50 - is going to be a graduation requirement
45:51 - i think in the next it's down to like
45:53 - three or four years now they're going to
45:54 - implement that so that's a pretty big
45:56 - deal and that's a big place you know
45:58 - that's a really big district um
46:00 - so there's a lot of moving pieces that
46:02 - that need to be put into place for that
46:04 - to happen and so as i was talking to
46:06 - some of the teachers there and hearing
46:07 - about
46:08 - um
46:09 - you know they have like one computer in
46:11 - the whole school and it doesn't work or
46:13 - something like that it's it's pretty
46:15 - scary and and i just think about the
46:18 - kids there and like how their experience
46:20 - is going to be so much different from a
46:22 - school in the same city with different
46:24 - resources and
46:26 - i don't know how to solve that
46:28 - and maybe i can't solve it but that was
46:30 - one of the scarier things that that i
46:33 - heard
46:33 - um what about what were you happiest
46:36 - about or was most encouraging yeah
46:38 - i think that
46:41 - again thinking about
46:42 - the
46:43 - um
46:44 - at the district level and at the higher
46:46 - administrator level
46:48 - um
46:49 - how talking to those people and and
46:51 - hearing how excited that they are about
46:53 - computer science and how important they
46:55 - think it is
46:56 - i think that's pretty exciting because
46:58 - you know those those people have power
47:00 - and they can they can help make this
47:02 - happen and so the more we can get those
47:03 - people on board the better
47:05 - yeah
47:06 - pat highs and lows
47:08 - yeah highs was um how how brave
47:13 - these teachers were in trying something
47:15 - new
47:15 - because um almost i mean
47:18 - the
47:19 - great majority of the teachers that we
47:21 - pd
47:22 - um were teaching um other subjects um
47:25 - not computer science and so they were
47:27 - trying something new and i just want to
47:29 - applaud the thousands of teachers
47:31 - trying uh this computer science thing
47:34 - for the first time ever with their kids
47:35 - because they know that
47:37 - it's worthwhile and even if they're not
47:39 - an expert they can they can at least do
47:41 - something to help their kids so that was
47:42 - the that was the um that was the high
47:45 - and especially the fact that these
47:46 - teachers who are so brave
47:48 - actually um had a good time at our
47:50 - professional development uh
47:52 - as a former teacher i've been through
47:54 - lots of bad professional development
47:56 - um
47:58 - and uh i never wanted to be a purveyor
48:00 - of bad professional development so i
48:02 - appreciate
48:03 - that as a high as a as a low i guess it
48:06 - would be our student learning outcomes
48:08 - um
48:10 - uh we're just you know this is just our
48:12 - first year so most people don't even
48:14 - worry about student learning outcomes um
48:16 - but i wish we had thought about it more
48:17 - right from the beginning we were more
48:20 - focused on the teacher aspect but really
48:22 - what it comes down to it is is the
48:24 - student
48:25 - student learning you know even if i
48:27 - guess even if teachers are having a bad
48:29 - time as long as students are having a
48:31 - good time and learning i guess that's
48:33 - really what it's about anyway
48:35 - of course i want teachers to have a good
48:36 - time too but you know you guys get what
48:38 - i'm saying you're talking to teachers
48:39 - right now
48:42 - that's right so those are my highs and
48:44 - lows
48:45 - wonderful
48:47 - okay so let's see i've got something
48:49 - here from grant that i'll need to read
48:51 - or pat heather maybe you could do that
48:52 - as well
48:53 - um and then flavia i see you have your
48:55 - webcam on did you want to ask a question
48:57 - or anything you can go ahead and unmute
48:59 - oh there's grant would you like to ask
49:00 - us go right ahead graham
49:04 - and then flappy you can go next if you
49:05 - had a question
49:07 - um i was just wondering
49:09 - because we see different types of
49:10 - teachers in the k5 area either
49:13 - implementing their coding into their
49:15 - classroom lessons and then we have the
49:17 - special area teachers um
49:19 - and uh they're dedicating their
49:21 - technology class to coding now which i
49:24 - think is a great 21st century update
49:26 - right
49:27 - um
49:28 - have you guys seen anything as far as
49:31 - your data or in observations
49:34 - uh the difference between the teacher
49:35 - side which one's better for the teacher
49:37 - and which one's better for the students
49:39 - because intuitively you would think
49:41 - special area teachers um or the students
49:44 - would get more of it so maybe they're
49:45 - doing better
49:47 - but is that so do do you have anything
49:49 - any information about that
49:51 - well i'll say that
49:53 - i think the pretty big majority of
49:56 - teachers that we've surveyed
49:58 - in the spring of this year
50:00 - were
50:01 - technology facilitators and so they
50:03 - taught more than one section
50:05 - and
50:09 - are we good
50:15 - there we go
50:16 - um
50:17 - so i would say that it's much more
50:18 - common from what we saw to have a
50:21 - technology facilitator doing this and
50:23 - even
50:24 - um
50:26 - like
50:27 - the technology facilitator might even be
50:29 - in charge of the whole
50:32 - school like not just
50:34 - getting all of the like they would see
50:36 - every kid in the school and then also
50:38 - they would be
50:39 - you know
50:40 - trying to get the other classroom
50:41 - teachers on board and i would ask in the
50:43 - interviews like so are you the only one
50:45 - doing this at your school and most of
50:47 - them are like yeah like there's one
50:49 - there's like a second grade teacher and
50:50 - she's sort of interested but i don't
50:51 - actually know if she's doing it or not
50:53 - so the the burden was in a lot of these
50:56 - cases of the teachers that i talked to
50:57 - the burden was on the technology
50:59 - facilitator to really be bringing this
51:01 - to everybody and so i don't i don't know
51:03 - if there's a better way i mean
51:06 - it's all going to be up to the school
51:07 - and the teachers and how they want to
51:09 - divide up their time
51:11 - um but i do know that some of the
51:13 - teachers that i talked to a lot so in
51:16 - chicago and charles county those were
51:18 - some of the places that i did a lot of
51:19 - the interviews
51:20 - um
51:22 - they already have other things the
51:24 - technology facilitators have other
51:25 - things they're supposed to be doing too
51:27 - they have
51:28 - history they have keyboarding which you
51:30 - know you might think that's not
51:32 - something that needs to be you know
51:33 - there might not you spend a lot of time
51:35 - on that but if you're talking about um
51:37 - a kindergartner who's
51:39 - maybe used to the touch screen i hear
51:41 - that a lot like they just want to swipe
51:43 - everything and they don't know how to
51:44 - use the keyboard they don't know how to
51:45 - use the mouse yet so you have to spend a
51:46 - lot of time getting into that and so
51:49 - they're all of these demands i guess and
51:51 - i guess i'm saying i don't know
51:54 - what about what about for the classroom
51:57 - teachers um my worry so so i've seen a
52:00 - lot of the technology special area
52:02 - teachers but then when i see people
52:03 - wanting to do the classroom teachers
52:06 - teach the coding have you seen if they
52:08 - actually teach it like will they
52:10 - actually take the time out to do it
52:13 - on a regular basis and how much time do
52:15 - you have you found that they do take to
52:17 - teach coding
52:19 - that's a really good question i think
52:20 - that
52:22 - anything that i say is just going to be
52:24 - based on the small number like a couple
52:26 - hundred teachers that were classroom
52:28 - teachers that took the survey so that's
52:29 - one thing to keep in mind and also keep
52:31 - in mind that anybody who filled out our
52:33 - survey is already super motivated
52:34 - because they didn't have to do it
52:36 - like nobody's telling i'm the only one
52:38 - telling them to do it
52:40 - you know they're really sweet nice
52:41 - teachers that did that for us but um
52:44 - i think that the people that are really
52:46 - committed are making it happen
52:48 - and i that's across the board so that's
52:50 - not just for elementary i think that's
52:53 - true we've seen that with high school
52:54 - even before code.org existed
52:56 - we interviewed and talked with teachers
52:58 - at the high school level who are like i
53:00 - want computer science in my school i'm
53:01 - going to go and bother the principal
53:03 - every day until i make it happen
53:06 - um and i think the opportunity is those
53:08 - so
53:09 - hitting the teachers that want to do it
53:10 - that's where you start but then the next
53:12 - opportunity is the folks who are kind of
53:14 - on the edge and they just need a little
53:16 - bit of confidence and they need a little
53:18 - bit of they need to believe that the
53:19 - time is well spent
53:21 - um and i think that's really our
53:22 - opportunity now
53:23 - is to go after that group of teachers
53:25 - and support them great and now that we
53:27 - have a data engineer at code.org and a
53:29 - learning scientist um we'll be able to
53:31 - look at some more less anecdotal data
53:34 - about implementation and actually look
53:35 - at how these student accounts are being
53:37 - used so hopefully by this time next year
53:39 - we'll be having a different conversation
53:41 - about this but
53:42 - it's a huge point grant yeah huge
53:45 - pat do you want to add anything
53:48 - that was good okay okay
53:52 - so we also
53:53 - about five minutes left grant so go
53:55 - ahead
53:57 - no you're fine i don't want to
53:58 - monopolize if anyone else has a question
54:00 - we are happy to have your questions i'm
54:01 - just looking to see if there are any
54:02 - others go right ahead
54:04 - okay so when you partner with the
54:06 - district you recommend then the special
54:09 - area class
54:11 - being the area to do the coding or
54:14 - is there a recommendation or do you just
54:16 - say whatever works best for your
54:18 - district and then hope that it gets done
54:22 - we we have implementation scenarios that
54:24 - are available that we share with um with
54:27 - the district that partner with us
54:29 - and uh they and from there they just
54:31 - pick what works best for them so um you
54:34 - know in some districts they have a
54:36 - dedicated computer lab feature in every
54:39 - single elementary school
54:40 - and thus they probably picked that some
54:43 - of them um
54:44 - they have um
54:46 - the
54:47 - the media specialists
54:49 - be played a double role as a computer
54:51 - lab teacher right and so they in that
54:53 - case they implemented through the the
54:55 - media lab time
54:57 - and so it really just depends but yeah
54:59 - we we have implementation scenarios that
55:01 - we suggest
55:02 - and uh they just pick and choose from
55:03 - there
55:06 - um okay last question if nobody else is
55:08 - asking
55:09 - oh sorry
55:10 - go ahead last one
55:12 - for for those teachers that are doing
55:15 - the whole school
55:16 - and right now there are only well
55:18 - there's four now right uh of course you
55:21 - guys have four courses for the k5
55:23 - um
55:24 - if
55:25 - um but for k5 there's six classes or you
55:28 - know uh grade levels so for those ones
55:31 - that are teaching all of it what happens
55:33 - now um you know in the next few years
55:35 - when the first graders who are in course
55:37 - one and then they move on to course two
55:39 - and then three
55:40 - and then four and then you know are
55:42 - there plans to keep expanding and i know
55:44 - there are a lot of other resources but
55:46 - you guys are just doing such a great job
55:48 - with the curriculum for teachers that
55:50 - don't know computer science are there
55:52 - plans to keep expanding to help include
55:54 - um lots of schools that can't hire
55:56 - someone who's actually trained in
55:58 - computer science yeah i'll answer that
56:00 - question because i'm the one who's been
56:02 - dealing with that the most um
56:05 - so yeah how do you set up a pathway for
56:08 - longevity and
56:10 - um that's basically what you're asking
56:12 - so this is what we're doing this is a
56:14 - this is top secret all right grant um
56:17 - okay
56:18 - but over the next few years over the
56:20 - next two years we plan to allow
56:24 - some level of customization for all of
56:26 - our course content
56:28 - um in the cs fundamentals program so
56:30 - what that means is that grant who
56:34 - teaches at a k through five school and
56:36 - wants to implement it in every single
56:37 - grade
56:38 - not just four grades or three or
56:40 - whatever
56:41 - that's up his courses himself using our
56:44 - puzzles as chunks and places them in
56:47 - some kind of
56:49 - you know course sequence that works for
56:51 - his
56:52 - goal so rather than coming up with maybe
56:54 - an implementation that works for
56:56 - 20 of the schools out there and then
56:58 - just hoping that other people figured
57:00 - out we we're just kind of opening up
57:03 - the we're giving teachers and districts
57:05 - the keys
57:06 - and letting them kind of configure their
57:08 - own um courses out of this material
57:12 - that's our goal awesome
57:14 - awesome very cool
57:16 - so this is great we love having this
57:18 - dialogue and um thank you so much for
57:20 - your questions grant and everyone else
57:22 - in the chat pod i do want to just
57:23 - reserve the last couple of minutes to
57:25 - summarize um and just to let you guys
57:27 - know that we're always open to having
57:29 - this dialogue in these conversations um
57:32 - at the end of uh the presentation i'll
57:33 - give you some ways that you can stay in
57:35 - contact with us and we can continue this
57:37 - chat and that goes for us two at outlier
57:39 - we're always happy i will take any
57:41 - question you have email me anytime you
57:43 - want
57:44 - and
57:45 - you know i'm happy to talk about
57:47 - whatever because i love doing this yeah
57:49 - i think for all of us this is you know
57:51 - our life's work and none of us have the
57:53 - answers so we're more than willing to
57:55 - engage in dialogue
57:57 - um so what i'm going to do now is i'm
57:59 - going to hand it back over to pat to
58:01 - summarize this evening and we're very
58:03 - lucky to have
58:04 - our special summarizer guest here mcyp
58:08 - um let me see
58:10 - people are wondering what why are they
58:12 - talking about
58:13 - what it is okay pat take it away
58:16 - oh so no slide right i can just take it
58:18 - away
58:19 - here it is
58:22 - here is the debut of mcyp which is
58:25 - this is i just want to preface this with
58:27 - this is a kind of silly but this is uh
58:30 - something i do at code.org i sometimes
58:32 - wrap
58:33 - so i'm i prepared a wrap thanking our cs
58:37 - community and our partners who've made
58:40 - code.org's work
58:42 - um even possible in its first year so
58:45 - this is to the tune of king of rock i'm
58:47 - not going to play the beat because it
58:48 - doesn't work very well in this situation
58:50 - but you can always go to youtube and
58:52 - look at run dmc's king of rock if you
58:54 - don't know it
58:55 - i'm a fan of 80s hip hop so
58:58 - that's why i picked king of rock so here
58:59 - we go all right ready
59:01 - i work at code.org situation is dire cs
59:05 - is awesome participation should be
59:07 - higher thanks to you all cs is on fire
59:10 - we can't stop working even when we tire
59:13 - now we rock k12 and come correct love
59:15 - computer science we need to connect
59:18 - thanks to thinkorsmith k5 has been set
59:21 - and to all others we've learned from we
59:23 - give you respect
59:25 - ecs and csp are getting bigger this is
59:28 - what we figure they have academic rigor
59:30 - and both are two pillars
59:32 - of nsf's work on them our hopes we can
59:35 - hang they're guaranteed
59:37 - they're guaranteed to be more popular
59:39 - than ap lang
59:40 - cs in math where math is the goal the
59:43 - bootstrap crew
59:45 - algebra and cs in their soul in middle
59:47 - schools they play a big role cs and math
59:50 - knowledge to teachers they dole
59:53 - um
59:54 - as we crash school walls sure we have
59:56 - our flaws
59:57 - don't just rely on our d on our ideas we
60:00 - rely on y'alls like project guts cnc cs
60:04 - in science they rock simulation is cool
60:07 - you'll hear the kids talk and talk
60:09 - for all our partners and friends and for
60:12 - new folks will meet all of us together
60:14 - no one can defeat
60:16 - beat beat it's a it's an echo so there
60:19 - you guys go it's it's on video
60:22 - um
60:24 - that's just something i like to do every
60:25 - now and then that's that's that's to our
60:27 - cs community and all of our partners i
60:30 - hope you
60:31 - hope you guys appreciate that
60:33 - love it pat we're gonna have to get you
60:35 - to do it again though over the music at
60:37 - some point because i think um it's not
60:40 - the same without the the beatbox in the
60:42 - background did you have any other
60:43 - parting words for us before i close out
60:46 - thank you for doing that pat you're a
60:47 - rock star yeah yeah i'm just i know guys

61:10 - this
61:11 - we really can't do this without you guys
61:13 - like our partners out there um our
61:16 - k5 affiliate
61:18 - trainer trainers our affiliates you know
61:20 - all of our facilitators out there who
61:22 - run the pd for us i mean um you guys are
61:25 - the key to code.org success i want to
61:27 - thank you guys and thank all you brave
61:28 - teachers out there for trying on
61:30 - computer science
61:33 - thanks so much pat so just as a reminder
61:35 - we're going to be hosting these webinars
61:37 - regularly throughout the fall our next
61:39 - one coming up on november 18th is
61:41 - focused on the hour of code and how
61:43 - teachers can implement our code in your
61:44 - classroom we have some really exciting
61:46 - best practices that we've captured from
61:49 - the hundreds of thousands of educators
61:51 - who have done
61:52 - our code in the past that we're excited
61:53 - to share with you um and that one we
61:55 - will be hosting through google hangouts
61:58 - on air so um you can find the link to
61:59 - that session into all of our upcoming
62:01 - sessions at code.org
62:04 - educate events
62:07 - and then also as i mentioned we are
62:09 - really open to having this dialogue and
62:11 - continue the conversation if you haven't
62:13 - already you should follow us on twitter
62:15 - at teach code that's where we're having
62:17 - our conversation about computer science
62:18 - education from a teacher's perspective
62:21 - we also have a teacher blog
62:22 - teacherblog.cod.org easy to remember um
62:25 - and a teacher forum which is
62:26 - forum.code.org
62:28 - there's also a facebook group too so if
62:30 - you go to facebook and search for cs
62:32 - education we're having kind of a
62:33 - discussion of more broadly about cs
62:35 - education beyond just code.org there so
62:38 - that's a great place also to get
62:39 - involved in the conversation
62:41 - um and again on behalf of code.org and
62:44 - heather and everyone here we want to say
62:46 - thank you for joining us thanks for
62:47 - making this a fun session tonight and we
62:50 - look forward to continuing the
62:51 - conversation
62:52 - bye
