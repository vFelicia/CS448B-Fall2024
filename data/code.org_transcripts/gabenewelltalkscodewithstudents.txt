00:00 - just a second okay so thank you for
00:03 - joining us for this uh Tech luminary
00:05 - chat this morning with Gabe n from Valve
00:07 - Corporation Gabe needs no introduction
00:09 - he's one of the most powerful men in the
00:10 - computer game business and valve is one
00:12 - of the most impressive uh computer game
00:14 - companies of all time and so I'm gonna
00:17 - turn over to Gabe for a few uh minutes
00:18 - of comments and then we're gonna open up
00:20 - for questions uh
00:23 - Gabe hi
00:25 - everybody uh Thanks James uh good to see
00:28 - you again
00:31 - uh I'm actually ready to just jump
00:32 - directly into Q&A since that that way
00:35 - people get the issues with yeah yeah
00:37 - absolutely let's do that okay then we're
00:38 - gonna start with Tom from Central Middle
00:40 - School so Tom or actually
00:45 - Anam okay you ready can you hear us yeah
00:47 - we hear
00:51 - you uh what was the game that was most
00:55 - interesting and challenging to
00:58 - create
01:00 - um so which game was the most
01:02 - interesting and challenging to create
01:05 - those there actually very different
01:06 - questions sometimes uh very challenging
01:09 - games you don't really learn a lot from
01:11 - them other than not to do that again uh
01:14 - certainly our first game was very
01:16 - interesting uh that was halflife the
01:19 - reason it was interesting is that we
01:20 - came into the field from outside of
01:23 - video games you know my background was
01:26 - in operating systems and productivity
01:28 - software you're tring to learn how to
01:30 - make entertainment products at the same
01:32 - time we were building one we had to
01:34 - learn a lot and the way that we kind of
01:37 - thought about problems didn't map to how
01:41 - lots of people inside of the game
01:43 - industry thought about problems we kind
01:45 - of had to invent some new rules just for
01:48 - our own purposes to so we had some way
01:52 - of making decisions and making
01:54 - tradeoffs uh but every one of them part
01:57 - of how we pick projects to do is
02:00 - you know we're looking for the
02:02 - opportunity to you know create more
02:05 - value for customers and so we're always
02:07 - trying to do you know we really don't
02:09 - like just repeating something we've done
02:11 - before we'd much rather pick problem
02:14 - that we think is kind of moves our our
02:17 - company or our Technologies or our
02:19 - processes forward so we always try to
02:22 - pick a certain amount
02:24 - of Challenge on all of them great all
02:28 - right thank you Gabe and just a reminder
02:29 - for everyone after you ask your question
02:31 - please mute your microphones so we don't
02:33 - get echo in chat and so on okay so the
02:35 - next question is going to be uh from the
02:37 - Met
02:45 - School right before we ask a
02:48 - question go ahead you can go ahead uh
02:50 - can we just request that um Gabe's mic
02:53 - be turned up a little bit if it's not oh
02:55 - I see it's a little hard to hear Gabe
02:56 - okay I don't know maybe you speak into
02:58 - the meh a little bit closer Gabe okay go
03:00 - ahead Keith or go ahead the med
03:02 - school hi um I was I was wondering uh
03:05 - what your biggest obstacle or challenge
03:07 - that you faced and getting to uh where
03:09 - you are
03:10 - today and this is Gabe personally or the
03:13 - company no Gabe gab okay the biggest
03:17 - challenge getting to where you are
03:19 - today
03:20 - um is the volume better now yeah great
03:24 - okay the I mean one of the biggest
03:26 - challenges was uh you know when I was in
03:31 - high school this career didn't even
03:33 - exist it wasn't like There Was You Know
03:36 - video gra development or educational
03:39 - support to that I didn't even really
03:42 - know that I was interested in this field
03:44 - until it kind of came into being so it's
03:46 - hard to be prepared this is going to be
03:48 - even worse for uh you guys because uh
03:53 - the rate of change continues to
03:56 - accelerate uh so the likelihood that the
03:59 - career that you end up having exists or
04:02 - that you the the likelihood that you're
04:05 - going to have to keep discovering new
04:07 - careers uh is a lot greater um that's
04:11 - sort of an interesting thing is to
04:13 - realize uh that you know the future is
04:16 - happening a lot faster than it used to
04:18 - and what its implications are for you
04:21 - personally you know in my grandparents
04:24 - generation people you know expected to
04:27 - work at the same company in the same
04:29 - industry doing more or less the same
04:31 - thing for their entire lives and my
04:33 - grandkids will probably you know find
04:37 - that they could have the risk of
04:39 - becoming technologically out ofd you
04:42 - know between Middle School and High
04:43 - School uh which is just a very different
04:47 - uh relationship to need to have with
04:50 - technological
04:51 - change
04:54 - um the uh you know the actual building
04:58 - of the company uh went you know fairly
05:02 - smoothly in terms of recognizing that
05:05 - the most important thing was were the
05:07 - people who are going to be at the
05:09 - company and finding a group of people
05:11 - who work well together once we had that
05:15 - in place almost all of the other
05:17 - problems tended to just be a question of
05:20 - of time and effort
05:23 - um I hope that gives you you know
05:27 - realistic sense of of the answer rather
05:30 - than sort of the simple answer of you
05:32 - saying oh well you know there was a lot
05:35 - of programming problems on that great
05:38 - thanks Gabe okay the next question is
05:40 - from the Westerly high school so we have
05:42 - the Westerly high school and go
05:45 - ahead uh what shifts do you see
05:48 - happening in technology that uh you are
05:50 - excited about so what shifts do you in
05:52 - technology do you find
05:54 - exciting uh there are sort of two that I
05:56 - think about a lot right now one is that
05:59 - the nature of uh how economies work are
06:02 - going to change fairly substantially
06:05 - over the next uh couple of decades um
06:10 - you know tradition you know an example
06:12 - of of how this is that usually
06:14 - corporations of the methods by which uh
06:17 - uh labor is organized and capital is
06:20 - allocated to some you know kind of old
06:22 - school 20th century terms um and uh the
06:29 - internet in a lot of ways does it a lot
06:31 - better so there's there's this classic
06:33 - paper by a guy named Co called the
06:35 - theory of the firm which tries to answer
06:36 - the question of why don't PR why doesn't
06:39 - pricing automatically cause people's
06:43 - work output to be used efficiently why
06:45 - do you have this other layer of a
06:47 - corporation you know and an employer and
06:50 - how is that possible you know if if the
06:53 - price mechanism is working well why
06:55 - don't people just find me and say hey
06:57 - we'd like you to do this work uh and uh
07:01 - capital is automatically being allocated
07:03 - efficiently to the people who will do
07:04 - something most useful so you've got this
07:08 - capitalist market-based mechanisms and
07:10 - then you've got this weird thing this
07:12 - giant blob right in the middle of it
07:13 - called the corporation that looks sort
07:15 - of like you know an authoritarian or
07:18 - totalitarian uh uh uh economic thing uh
07:24 - so how does that make sense and the
07:26 - answer the coast would say well here's
07:28 - why it makes sense cost of the recovery
07:29 - and uh reputational value and uh
07:33 - transaction costs uh but he probably he
07:37 - just died recently uh he probably would
07:40 - have said that the internet will replace
07:41 - most of those functions much more
07:43 - efficiently I think that that is pretty
07:45 - accurate and it's going to be a lot of
07:47 - fun to watch how that changes uh I think
07:50 - it mimics what we already see in game
07:52 - development where the audience is the
07:54 - source of as much of the value if not
07:56 - more of the value than the the the the
07:59 - nominal
08:00 - Creator um another area of technology
08:03 - that I'm really interested in is that um
08:07 - our ability to talk directly to people's
08:10 - brains is uh getting better a lot faster
08:14 - and a lot sooner than I think uh
08:17 - certainly that I expected you know that
08:20 - there's research going on right now to
08:23 - uh directly uh generate images inside of
08:27 - people's brains and and uh it's not just
08:32 - hey cool I've got a super high you know
08:34 - I'll plug in to my you know I have a VGA
08:36 - connector on the back of my skull but
08:39 - you know it actually opens
08:41 - up fairly science fictiony uh abilities
08:45 - fairly soon in terms of the subjective
08:48 - experience that you can create for
08:50 - people uh and it's kind of surprising
08:54 - that it's happening uh at the rate that
08:57 - it is uh rather than then you know it
09:00 - used to be fairly comfortable to think
09:02 - oh way off in the future well you know
09:05 - the the fundamental science is being
09:07 - done right now that will enable us to
09:09 - start doing those kinds of things uh but
09:12 - that's pretty interesting and I think
09:14 - they'll obviously have a huge impact on
09:16 - the kinds of experiences we like to have
09:18 - great thanks Gabe okay the next question
09:20 - we have is from the Benway School the
09:23 - Benway School is
09:27 - right right here Benway School
09:30 - hello
09:32 - hi um our question is if you can give
09:35 - any advice for someone who wants to
09:37 - pursue a career in the gaming industry
09:40 - what would it
09:42 - be so uh you know in the past there were
09:46 - always sort of these Gatekeepers you
09:48 - know people who had to give you the
09:50 - ability in order to do something like
09:52 - how do you make a game well you have to
09:54 - get a job in order to make a game you
09:57 - know how do you get an education you
09:58 - have to go to a you have to get admitted
10:01 - to a
10:02 - university and so we've all sort of been
10:04 - trained to think in terms of there's who
10:07 - are the people that I need you know uh
10:11 - to get their blessing in order to do
10:14 - sort of things that really doesn't exist
10:16 - anymore but the best way in our view is
10:19 - to actually just start doing it right
10:21 - now and the key characteristic is to
10:23 - build something that has an audience
10:26 - measure how the audience reacts to what
10:28 - you do make some changes and then
10:30 - iterate that could be you know making
10:32 - Clan logos for your friends or hosting a
10:35 - website where you do funy or interesting
10:38 - reviews of games or building small games
10:41 - themselves so that is you know a super
10:45 - valuable experience whether you go into
10:47 - the automotive industry or into research
10:49 - or anything else that uh iteration or
10:53 - you know with
10:55 - uh a logical set of customers who
10:59 - satisfaction or utilization of what
11:01 - you're building is quantifiable that
11:03 - feeds back into that process you can do
11:05 - that right now and the weird thing is
11:08 - you guys are probably ahead of most you
11:13 - know professors and most vice presidents
11:17 - at at at corporations at understanding
11:20 - that so you haven't actually been
11:22 - corrupted yet and you kind of get it
11:25 - more whether it's how can I get more
11:26 - people to you know be my
11:29 - friend on Facebook or get more people to
11:32 - follow my uh Twitter feed you're sort of
11:35 - used to thinking of it but what you're
11:36 - not used to thinking of it is that's an
11:38 - awesome way to develop yourself
11:40 - professionally so you know just pick
11:42 - something now and you know try to think
11:45 - really hard about how can I here's this
11:48 - number that I'm going to pay attention
11:49 - to how can I make that number as big as
11:51 - possible what are the tradeoffs in the
11:53 - choices you know uh um that's you know
11:57 - the best way to do it sounds really
11:58 - different but saying go to digipen which
12:00 - is a great thing to do or you know work
12:03 - on your programming which of course you
12:04 - should do but it's that experience of
12:08 - having an object an asset a pro a
12:12 - service measuring how well it's doing
12:15 - and then uh uh taking a set of steps
12:19 - that are that create both positive and
12:20 - negative effects in those outcomes and
12:22 - then continuing to adjust your behavior
12:24 - going forward that's the incredibly
12:26 - valuable thing that you can do whether
12:28 - you're an artist a programmer or a
12:30 - researcher or anything else and it's
12:33 - that recognition that your ability to do
12:36 - that today is you know a thousand times
12:40 - better than the best financed company
12:44 - from 20 years ago right you have so many
12:48 - you have the way better tools than you
12:50 - know General Motors did you know you
12:54 - know at the beginning of the dotcom era
12:56 - great thank you Gabe okay the next
12:58 - question is from Sil Prairie High School
13:00 - uh let's find John from silk Prairie
13:02 - High School that's right no no no right
13:07 - there okay hi can you hear us y we hear
13:10 - you all right we have Nick and he's
13:13 - gonna be asking a question about
13:15 - education what exper what educational
13:18 - experien has best prepared you for the
13:20 - work that you do
13:24 - now uh the uh the most valuable
13:27 - educational experience
13:29 - for me was sort of a non-traditional one
13:31 - I started
13:32 - um uh I was going to University and went
13:36 - out to visit my brother he just started
13:38 - at this new software company was the
13:40 - third largest software company on the
13:41 - east side of Lake
13:43 - Washington and uh I was going out to
13:45 - visit
13:46 - him uh and all of a sudden he was
13:49 - working all the time so rather than
13:51 - hanging out with me and you know seeing
13:53 - the Space Needle I was just hanging out
13:55 - with him at work and uh Steve Balmer
13:58 - who's currently the president got mad
14:00 - that I was distracting him and said well
14:02 - if you're going to be spending all your
14:03 - time hanging out here you need to do
14:05 - something useful uh those first three
14:08 - months when I was working with people
14:10 - like Tom Corbett and Neil conen and
14:13 - Steve Wood were probably the most
14:16 - intense and valuable educational
14:19 - experience I've ever had they sort of
14:21 - showed me how to be a software a
14:25 - professional software developer you know
14:27 - it was an incredibly fast and really
14:30 - significant set of lessons that I that I
14:33 - learned uh I'm not sure how anybody else
14:36 - can replicate that other than to say
14:38 - that actually trying to do what you want
14:41 - to do with people who are already really
14:43 - really good at it is one of the most
14:46 - powerful educational experiences you can
14:48 - have um not to bang on Harvard but I
14:51 - learned more in in three months uh with
14:55 - with those guys at Microsoft than I did
14:57 - the entire uh time I I was at Harvard at
15:00 - Harvard I learned how to drink beer
15:04 - while doing a headstand in the snow so
15:08 - uh which you know it's a useful skill
15:11 - that uh not nearly as useful as how to
15:13 - actually develop software and and think
15:15 - about how small group and large group
15:19 - processes uh affect outc great thank you
15:23 - Gabe okay and next up we have horis man
15:27 - School
15:29 - and school here Horman school and my old
15:32 - Alum I should say so hor
15:35 - man wrong school I'm sorry Hi um so
15:39 - we're hor man School in New York and
15:42 - this is seventh grade I'm jul how do
15:45 - programmers at Val work in teams to
15:48 - develop products I don't know if you
15:50 - caught that g the question is how do
15:51 - programmers work in teams ADV valve to
15:54 - create
15:55 - products uh so what are the horest man
15:59 - what's your mascot The Horseman fighting
16:01 - weasles the horeman it's a lion
16:05 - right a
16:08 - lion a lion okay yes go
16:13 - lion um the uh so uh so the a lot of
16:21 - times the question comes down to
16:24 - um okay do you if people know what a
16:27 - prediction Market is basically
16:29 - recognizes there's a bunch of
16:30 - information contained in
16:33 - transactions of significance so uh it's
16:37 - just a really useful way of uh doing
16:40 - information Discovery particularly
16:41 - around price or other things which are
16:44 - proxies for Price
16:46 - internally the one thing that we
16:49 - never that we try to avoid at all costs
16:53 - is steering how people spend their time
16:55 - and this sounds like exactly the
16:57 - opposite of what most companies do where
17:00 - uh directing other people's activities
17:03 - is sort of the defining characteristic
17:04 - of management so we seem to be saying
17:08 - that's that's actually the only way you
17:10 - can really damage the productivity of
17:12 - these people so what we say
17:14 - is you have a limited amount of time
17:17 - that's the that's the scarcest resource
17:19 - we have every decision you make with
17:22 - your time is a vote about what the
17:25 - company's priority should be so the
17:27 - question you should ask
17:29 - as a programmer is uh what's the best
17:32 - way for me to spend my time right now
17:34 - that creates value for our customers not
17:37 - what is my boss going to measure me
17:39 - against as as a yard stick so we tell
17:42 - people that they're the ones who are
17:43 - making the decision uh and that it's all
17:47 - about them coming up with the their best
17:50 - estimate of uh of how they can create
17:53 - value for our customers now that sounds
17:55 - kind of chaotic but it actually turns
17:57 - out to be a really good way of for us of
18:01 - coordinating people's activity you know
18:03 - so an engineer will be sitting there
18:05 - saying I see that these other guys are
18:07 - working on this I actually know how to
18:09 - solve that problem and even though I
18:10 - don't necessarily understand the bigger
18:12 - picture of what they're doing I can see
18:14 - that I can create a lot of value right
18:17 - now by uh taking what I've learned in
18:20 - matchmaking in this game and applying it
18:22 - in matchmaking on their game
18:26 - um uh the the there's no uh we tend to
18:32 - embed a lot of processes into tools so
18:35 - the tools tend to iterate over time as
18:38 - we think about different ways of
18:39 - improving productivity so when you think
18:42 - of how builds get made or uh code gets
18:45 - checked in and out of the projects uh we
18:48 - try to build support make certain kinds
18:51 - of data highly visible inside of the
18:53 - organization in terms of uh making it
18:56 - easy to spot problems as as soon as uh
19:00 - possible um but at the end of the day
19:03 - we're really highly dependent on the
19:06 - individual programmers sense of what
19:08 - they should be doing on and how to be as
19:10 - productive uh in achieving that as
19:12 - possible the first engineering problem
19:15 - they have is to engineer their own daily
19:18 - workflow thank you Gabe and by the way
19:20 - to all the students gab's giving was
19:22 - essentially a master's level a lot of
19:24 - his answers here are excellent and I
19:26 - encourage you to go back and watch his
19:28 - video a few times because I think
19:29 - there's a lot of really valuable
19:30 - information in here that may be a little
19:32 - bit tough to parse uh the first time
19:34 - you're hearing it but this is this is
19:35 - thank you gab this is excellent our next
19:37 - question is from Tommy uh at the Usher
19:40 - ker Elementary
19:44 - School okay go
19:46 - ahead good morning Mr gab new on behalf
19:50 - of Usha K Elementary School we would
19:52 - like to say thank you for taking time to
19:54 - talk to us and impart your knowledge
19:57 - about cing and computer program we
20:00 - believe that reading and writing codes
20:02 - will prepare us to be successful in the
20:05 - 21st
20:06 - century here at Ooa Elementary our model
20:09 - is work hard get sm with no excuses our
20:13 - future goal is to transition from being
20:16 - users and consumers to Innovative
20:18 - thinkers and
20:20 - creators with that being said can you
20:22 - describe free Elementary level web-
20:25 - based programs platforms and
20:27 - organization gr that can that can even
20:31 - out playing fields for the students
20:34 - regardless of their social economic
20:36 - status to learn how to create feature
20:40 - apps video gaming and program programs
20:44 - and okay thank you very much did you c a
20:48 - question yeah I think I did so um here's
20:52 - an example where there sort of needs to
20:54 - be a dialogue between the parents and
20:57 - the teachers and the students so some
21:00 - places uh hate it when the students are
21:03 - texting in class so you say oh the
21:06 - students really distracted they're
21:08 - making noise they're whatever but the
21:10 - reality is that if you look at the
21:12 - volume of text production that kids who
21:17 - are texting each other are actually
21:19 - writing a huge amount more than kids in
21:23 - my generation were writing that there
21:25 - the amount of writing production they do
21:27 - was spectacular and that just the
21:30 - practice of writing makes a much better
21:32 - writer sooner so on the one hand you
21:34 - have something that looks like it's the
21:36 - enemy of Education having a phone and
21:39 - texting your friends and sending them
21:41 - pictures of cats doing making funny
21:44 - noises but when you actually say well
21:47 - let's just step back and rather than
21:49 - saying uh let's just you know say that
21:52 - that's bad maybe it's actually an
21:54 - incredibly good thing when you really
21:55 - look at what those outcomes are so uh
21:59 - that's where the kids and the teachers
22:01 - uh and the parents need to actually have
22:03 - that conversation of is this really a
22:06 - bad idea so my kids uh like to play
22:10 - video games and you know even though I'm
22:13 - into video game business I go like okay
22:15 - come on you're you know you need to do
22:17 - some you need to be outside or you know
22:20 - uh go read a book or something like that
22:22 - on the other hand I'll be sitting there
22:23 - and I'll be listening to them playing a
22:25 - video game and they're shouting at other
22:28 - people in Russian and
22:30 - German uh so the reality is even though
22:33 - they don't think they're learning
22:34 - anything playing any video games they're
22:36 - actually picking up a bunch of foreign
22:39 - language skills and they're connecting
22:41 - with uh people all over all over the
22:43 - world you know people that uh my
22:46 - generation would have never even known
22:48 - existed they're casually
22:51 - learning multiple language vocabularies
22:54 - in the context of these of these games
22:58 - so uh the real thing I'd say is rather
23:00 - than picking a b or c and saying that
23:02 - those are the right things is that the
23:04 - parents and the teachers and the
23:05 - students need to have a really
23:07 - thoughtful conversation about what are
23:10 - the things the students are actually
23:12 - ahead of both parents and the teachers
23:14 - in terms of knowing what it is that's
23:16 - really cool and what needs to happen is
23:19 - to have a conversation about how that
23:20 - can be as beneficial to all the students
23:23 - as possible while mitigating you know
23:26 - any of the potential down side so ra I
23:29 - would say to you guys you guys actually
23:31 - probably know better than anybody else
23:33 - what are the most useful pieces of
23:35 - technology to use right now is it
23:38 - Snapchat is it Facebook is it Instagram
23:42 - I mean is to think about those things
23:44 - and try to come up with an educational
23:46 - friendly or an educationally oriented
23:48 - way of using that uh and that's not
23:51 - going to stop there's going to be more
23:52 - and more of these things coming all the
23:54 - time and you guys are actually going to
23:56 - be a lot smarter and a lot more
23:59 - comfortable with those Technologies as
24:01 - long as you're using them on a regular
24:03 - basis than the teachers and the parents
24:06 - so kids are really going to need to show
24:08 - some leadership in terms of uh sort of
24:11 - being patient with the parents and
24:13 - teachers but also being to kind of
24:15 - engaged around that issue great thank
24:18 - you Gabe okay we have our last question
24:20 - now is from East Hill Elementary School
24:22 - East Hill Elementary
24:26 - School okay turn on your
24:29 - microphone hear
24:32 - you hi my name is leis and we are the
24:36 - East blaz dis from Kamp
24:40 - Washington my question is is there a
24:45 - way for me to start making my own video
24:48 - game well there are lots of ways to make
24:50 - your own video game and there are lots
24:52 - of tools uh to help you do that um you
24:56 - know uh you know there's Minecraft s
25:00 - that's out there there's uh Gary's mod
25:04 - um more and more games are putting in uh
25:07 - user generated content like uh scheme
25:10 - Workshop features so you know the main
25:12 - thing is to pick a game you like and
25:14 - then look for ways uh to extend that
25:17 - that way you sort of can work within a
25:19 - framework that you already understand or
25:21 - an art direction or uh an engine design
25:25 - and then once you've done that then
25:26 - start to build up out and use tool kits
25:29 - like uh Unity or the source engine uh to
25:33 - to build more ambitious uh projects
25:38 - um also the line is sort of blurring
25:41 - between uh what the different forms of
25:43 - creation are uh in our own mind for
25:46 - example we look at um professional game
25:50 - players the sort of our collaborators
25:52 - and creating the the overall video game
25:54 - experience so like if you really like
25:57 - watching gendi or Mushi play uh go to or
26:00 - Sing Sing uh in a sense they're creating
26:04 - you know television serialized
26:06 - television and we think really hard
26:09 - about how to how to make that happen uh
26:12 - so don't dismiss you know just taking a
26:14 - video camera and pointing it to yourself
26:16 - and talking about what you like as a
26:19 - stepping stone towards being in content
26:22 - uh creation business and if you find
26:25 - something's a little frustrating or
26:27 - repetitive or difficult that's an
26:28 - opportunity to write some codes to make
26:30 - that process simpler uh so the easiest
26:34 - thing to do is just to pick something
26:36 - you really like and enjoy and think
26:38 - about how to make it more fun for you
26:41 - and for your friends and all of a sudden
26:43 - you'll discover you know like Gary's Mod
26:46 - or Minecraft that you have sort of
26:49 - stepped into building you know you games
26:53 - that millions of people are playing all
26:54 - over the
26:56 - world all right well thank you then that
26:58 - completes all of our questions so uh
27:01 - let's hear a round of applause for Gabe
27:03 - n everyone for gabes you can unmute your
27:05 - microphones now Round of
27:22 - Applause in the same way that I've said
27:25 - to you that it's useful to get
27:28 - feedback for me I do this and I try to
27:31 - think of how to do it better next time
27:33 - just like I told you guys so my email is
27:36 - Gaben
27:38 - Gaben Val valv
27:41 - software.com and if you guys could give
27:43 - me
27:44 - feedback uh sort of saying this is what
27:46 - you like this is what you didn't like
27:49 - this made sense this other thing this
27:51 - sounded completely incomprehensible that
27:54 - would be useful for me because it's kind
27:56 - of a two-way street the next time I do
27:58 - this I'd like to be better at it and you
28:00 - guys can help me get better at it by
28:02 - giving me feedback all right great thank
28:04 - you very much Gabe with that we're gonna
