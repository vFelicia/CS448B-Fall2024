00:04 - what i love about the computer science
00:05 - principles curriculum and activities is
00:07 - that
00:08 - the course is really just a touch upon
00:10 - course it touches upon it
00:13 - coding ai
00:15 - how the internet works
00:17 - computer science theory like binary
00:19 - numbers and number systems
00:21 - data analysis big data all of these
00:24 - things together make up computer science
00:26 - one of the best things about teaching
00:28 - computer science is seeing their
00:30 - creative side seeing students creative
00:32 - side seeing their passions their
00:34 - interests
00:35 - come to life through their apps
00:37 - and and i've seen in recent years
00:39 - code.org changed their curriculum to
00:42 - give students more of an opportunity to
00:43 - be
00:44 - unique and to showcase um what they are
00:47 - passionate about when they're making
00:49 - their apps and encouraging to make
00:50 - things that will change the world
00:53 - and i like how code.org has laid out the
00:55 - brainstorming the planning process when
00:57 - we're designing an app where they get
00:59 - feedback from others and they focus on
01:01 - what is the purpose of the app what do
01:03 - we want it to do
01:05 - when i think about
01:07 - students going off and getting a job
01:08 - they're all inevitably going to use a
01:10 - computer no matter what field they go
01:12 - into
01:13 - and being able to see the computer is
01:15 - something more than just this magic
01:18 - black box that hopefully does what you
01:20 - want it to but having some control over
01:21 - it some understanding
01:23 - it's going to take them very far and
01:25 - it's going to save them some frustration
01:26 - at the very least
01:28 - code.org focuses greatly
01:30 - on building a classroom culture that is
01:33 - welcoming
01:35 - code.org
01:36 - wants your classroom to be a classroom
01:38 - where students feel comfortable students
01:40 - from all different levels whether they
01:42 - are students with special needs to
01:44 - students who are high achieving
01:46 - students of different ethnicities and
01:48 - genders
01:49 - all students
01:50 - can be welcomed into a computer science
01:52 - classroom and can learn computer science
01:54 - and having something like ap computer
01:56 - science principles as an option and
01:58 - something that has the ap name behind it
02:00 - that can really encourage them and their
02:01 - families to get them to sign up for that
02:04 - is something that i think is really
02:05 - powerful
02:14 - you
