00:00 - Hour of Code Minecraft | Loops
00:06 - Hi, I'm Lisa.
00:08 - I'm a software developer on Minecraft and
I work on some of the animals and enemies
00:13 - in the game.
00:15 - One of the animals that I worked on is the
ocelot and I worked on the part where when
00:20 - you're holding the fish the ocelot will sneak
towards you.
00:23 - And if you feed it the fish, you tame it,
and the ocelot is your own cat.
00:29 - As humans, we get really bored if we have
to do the same thing over and over and over
00:35 - again.
00:36 - But the cool thing about computers is that
they can do the same thing millions or even
00:40 - billions of times in a row without getting
bored.
00:44 - This repetition is called a loop and every
creature in Minecraft uses loops.
00:50 - Earlier, we got a chicken to move across the
screen but then she stopped.
00:56 - In Minecraft, the chickens wander around forever
and ever.
00:59 - Let's use a "forever do" loop from our toolbox
to keep our chickens moving around forever
01:04 - too.
01:07 - The power of loops will save you tons of time
and open up all kinds of neat options as you
01:12 - build your own version of Minecraft.
