00:00 - Hour of Code Minecraft | Introduction
00:04 - Hi, my name is Jens and
I'm the lead creative designer
00:08 - of Minecraft.
00:09 - In the next hour, you'll make your own Minecraft
game.
00:12 - This looks like Minecraft but the world has
stopped.
00:16 - The sheep aren't moving, the chickens aren't
laying eggs, and zombies are just standing
00:20 - still.
00:21 - It's up to you to add the code to make the
Minecraft world work.
00:25 - My name is Melissa and I am a user researcher
at Minecraft.
00:29 - (So do you want them to do all that stuff
forever?
00:32 - Yes.)
00:33 - What I'm really interested in is how people
think and interact with technology and so
00:36 - this job is the perfect job for me to put
together the computer engineering with the
00:41 - psychology: how people think and behave.
00:44 - You'll see your screen is split into three
main parts.
00:48 - 1) On the left is the Minecraft game.
00:51 - Right now the world is frozen but we're going
to fix that with code.
00:55 - 2) This middle area is the toolbox.
00:58 - Each of these blocks is a command that chickens,
sheep, and other Minecraft creatures can understand.
01:05 - 3) The space on the right is called the workspace
and this is where we'll build our program.
01:11 - If you forget what to do, the instructions
for each level are at the top.
01:16 - To start off, we're going to program a chicken.
01:19 - Let's drag the "move forward" command to the
workspace.
01:24 - When I hit "Run" the chicken moves forward
one step.
01:27 - To go further, I'll drag another "move forward"
block underneath the first "move forward"
01:33 - block until the highlight appears.
01:35 - Then I'll drop it and the two blocks snap
together.
01:39 - If I hit "Run" again, the chicken walks two
steps.
01:43 - If you ever want to delete a block, just remove
it from the stack and drag it back to the
01:49 - toolbox.
01:50 - After you've hit "Run" you can always hit
the "Reset" button to reset the game and start
01:55 - over.
01:57 - Now, it's your turn to make your very own
version of Minecraft.
02:01 - Have fun!
