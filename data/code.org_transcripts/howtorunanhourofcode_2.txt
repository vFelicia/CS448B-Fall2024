00:00 - Introducing the Hour of Code
00:03 - This December,
we're recruiting students from all over the
00:06 - world to participate in 1 Hour of Code. We're
aiming for 100 million students, and we need
00:11 - your help to make it happen. The Hour of Code
is an hour long introduction to computer science
00:16 - for all students. No previous experience is
required and the activities are designed to
00:21 - be self-guided, empowering students to learn
at their own pace. This matters because the
00:25 - number of computing jobs in the United States
alone is rising 3 times faster than the number
00:30 - of computer science graduates. At this rate,
by 2020, there will be more than 1 million
00:34 - computing jobs unfilled. And these are good
jobs! We expect to have more than 20 different
00:40 - 1 hour tutorials to choose from, each introducing
computer science in it's own way for all students
00:45 - from K-12. For example, we're expecting 1
tutorial to teach how to create an interactive
00:51 - card using the programming environment Scratch.
Another from KhanAcademy will teach the basics
00:56 - of Javascript, a popular programming language.
Our own tutorial will introduce some computer
01:01 - science principles through a series of puzzles
that are fun to solve. You can do the Hour
01:07 - of Code on a range of devices: tablets, PCs,
Macs, and smartphones. There will even be
01:13 - unplugged tutorials that can be completed
without any computers at all. Now let's talk
01:18 - about the Hour of Code itself. You can do
the Hour of Code anytime between December
01:24 - 8th and December 14th. That's Computer Science
Education Week. Our goal is to reach 100 million
01:30 - students worldwide by the end of that week.
The first thing you'll need to figure out
01:36 - is where you'll do your Hour of Code. One
option is to use a computer lab with Internet
01:40 - connected PCs or Macs. Another option is to
do the Hour of Code in your classroom, using
01:45 - tablets or smartphones, as long as they can
access the Internet. Students can also take
01:50 - turns doing the Hour of Code in your classroom,
using a shared, Internet connected computer.
01:55 - In fact, we encourage students to do the Hour
of Code together, in pairs or small groups.
01:59 - Research shows that students retain more when
they program together. The unplugged options
02:04 - can be done anywhere--even outdoors. These
activities are especially fun for groups and
02:09 - illustrate the point: computational thinking
does not require a computer. Next, you'll
02:14 - need to select which tutorial to use. The
week before the Hour of Code, you'll be able
02:19 - to visit our website at code.org/learn to
preview the available tutorials. If you're
02:22 - not sure which tutorial to pick, we'll recommend
one for you. We encourage you to try doing
02:27 - the selected tutorial yourself, before your
class does it, so you can answer any questions
02:31 - that might come up. Finally, it will be time
for your students to do the Hour of Code themselves.
02:37 - Have them visit our website at code.org/learn,
and choose the tutorial that you selected.
02:40 - If you're doing an unplugged tutorial, pass
out the materials and explain the rules. Your
02:45 - students will enjoy doing the Hour of Code.
The tutorials are designed to be fun! Students
02:50 - who finish early can try a different, perhaps
more advanced tutorial, or help other students.
02:55 - And that's it! As you see, offering the Hour
of Code to your students is easy. It requires
03:00 - minimal prior preparation and no prior experience.
In just one hour you'll have given your students
03:05 - an engaging and meaningful exposure to the
world of computer science, and help demystify
03:10 - what can be an intimidating subject to some.
