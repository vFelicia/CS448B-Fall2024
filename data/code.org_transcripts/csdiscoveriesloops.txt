00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - my name is Jerome Holman and I work in
00:07 - the windows devices group at Microsoft
00:08 - it's basically a team where we build
00:11 - cool stuff tablets phones things like
00:13 - hololens that hopefully will excite and
00:15 - delight customers programming languages
00:18 - usually have a few different ways to
00:20 - define and control behavior that should
00:23 - repeat these are usually called loops
00:26 - they go by different names and different
00:29 - languages like for loop while loop
00:33 - do-while loop for each loop repeat loop
00:37 - and so on and so forth
00:39 - these types of loops have small
00:41 - differences but all of them are just
00:44 - different ways to get the computer to
00:45 - execute some lines of code repeatedly
00:48 - often in programming we have an
00:51 - algorithm that just needs to repeat a
00:53 - specific number of times or repeated
00:55 - while some condition holds true we're
00:58 - going to show you how to use a looping
01:00 - structure called a for loop in
01:02 - JavaScript and you can find for loops in
01:05 - the control section of the toolbox it
01:08 - looks like this when you drag it out a
01:11 - for loop in Java Script
01:13 - like this one it's just a type of
01:15 - counter loop it counts up from zero to
01:19 - the number you type in let's do a little
01:23 - experimentation you can drag any
01:25 - commands you like inside the for loop
01:28 - block these commands will be executed
01:31 - over and over for however many times you
01:35 - specify in the loop when you've run the
01:38 - loop notice the app lab highlights each
01:40 - line as it executes now why does the for
01:45 - loop block highlight after each
01:47 - iteration of the loop that's because the
01:50 - for loop needs to check its counter
01:52 - every time to see if it should stop or
01:55 - run the commands inside the loop one
01:58 - more time one thing to note about loops
02:01 - is that your code will still execute
02:03 - from top to bottom as before you can put
02:07 - lines of code before the loop if you
02:09 - need to get something set up before the
02:11 - loop starts likewise after the
02:14 - is done executing it will pick up on the
02:16 - line right after the loop loops are our
02:19 - powerful programming construct that uses
02:22 - the computer's primary advantage over
02:24 - humans that being their amazing speed by
02:28 - repeating commands as many times as we
02:30 - wish
02:30 - loops allow us to solve new problems at
02:33 - a scale that would be impossible without
02:36 - computers there is still much to learn
02:39 - about the loop but the concept is simple
02:41 - loops repeat commands as many times as
02:45 - we need now you know how to use a simple
02:49 - loop you can use them in your programs
02:51 - and take advantage of your computer's
02:54 - power and speed
