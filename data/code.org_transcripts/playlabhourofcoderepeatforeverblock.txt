00:00 - Can you imagine if you had to repeat something
forever and ever? Well hopefully you never
00:05 - have to, because computers are really good
at repeating things for you. This is the "repeat
00:11 - forever" block. Anything inside this block
will happen forever in the game. If we want
00:16 - an actor to do something repeatedly, without
the player having to do anything, we'll put
00:21 - those blocks inside the "repeat forever" block.
In this next puzzle, our goal is to help the
00:27 - wizard patrol the boundaries of the kingdom,
left and right continuously. Learning how
00:32 - the repeat commands works, will save you a
ton of time later when you build your own game.
