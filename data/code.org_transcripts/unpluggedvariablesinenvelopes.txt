00:22 - This lesson is called variables in envelopes.
00:26 - We're going to learn how we can build sentences when we're still missing pieces of information.
00:30 - Most of us are already familiar with the idea of filling in a blank.
00:34 - We do it when we're
putting our name on our homework.
00:37 - Sometimes, there's more than one blank that needs to be filled out, and in that case,
00:41 - we give the blank a label so that we know which piece
of information goes where.
00:47 - Variables are placeholders for pieces of information that can change.
00:51 - By using a variable for the missing information, we can continue working on whatever we were doing,
00:56 - and let someone else fill in information later.
00:59 - In software, we use variables a lot.
01:02 - We use variables as placeholders for name, email address, and even username.
01:06 - That way, we can let the program know where those details will appear
01:10 - after the user fills them in.
01:12 - We use variables all the time in our work.
01:15 - Any time you need to store a piece of information
for later, we use a variable. Let's say we
01:20 - Let's say we need to count the number of times the user has tweeted.
01:26 - Every time that user tweets, we'll add one to that number.
01:28 - And every time
the user deletes a tweet, we'll decrease that number by one.
01:32 - Anytime we need to know how
many times that user has tweeted,
01:36 - we'll just look at that variable.
