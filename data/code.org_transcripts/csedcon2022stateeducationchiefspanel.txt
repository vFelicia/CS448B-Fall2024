00:00 - to close us out for the day we have this
00:02 - absolutely phenomenal panel of State
00:04 - leaders to share some insights with us
00:08 - and this is really a big deal this is a
00:11 - first for Cs edcon and probably a first
00:14 - for CS education to have this many state
00:17 - leaders talking together about Computer
00:20 - Science Education is absolutely
00:22 - thrilling and I'm so glad that you all
00:23 - will be here for it
00:25 - [Applause]
00:32 - so I'm going to start by introducing
00:33 - each of our panelists so when I say your
00:36 - name just give a quick wave to the
00:38 - audience and folks will save our
00:40 - Applause until all of them have been
00:42 - introduced
00:44 - uh so first I want to mention a couple
00:46 - State Chiefs who were meant to be here
00:48 - but couldn't uh be here for this this
00:49 - panel secretary Manny Diaz from Florida
00:53 - was here earlier today for a
00:54 - conversation unfortunately had to go to
00:57 - a prior commitment for this afternoon
00:59 - and Dr Penny Schwinn from Tennessee also
01:02 - wasn't able to be here but I'd plan to
01:04 - be here and uh you will see her on the
01:06 - slide so she is unfortunately not here
01:09 - all right so here we have uh Dr Angelica
01:12 - Allen McMillan of New Jersey
01:15 - superintendent Kirsten Basler of North
01:17 - Dakota
01:19 - superintendent Jillian Balo of Virginia
01:23 - superintendent Joan Ebert from Nevada
01:26 - Dr Daniel French of Vermont
01:29 - Dr Christina Grant from DC
01:33 - superintendent Johnny key from Arkansas
01:36 - Dr Eric Mackey from Alabama
01:39 - commissioner Pender Macon from Maine
01:43 - secretary Tiffany Sanderson from South
01:45 - Dakota
01:46 - and superintendent Molly Spearman from
01:48 - South Carolina give him a warm welcome
01:51 - [Applause]
01:58 - and I want to introduce you to one more
02:00 - person Bob renssey Bob is the interim
02:03 - leader of chiefs for change he's also a
02:06 - code.org board member and the former
02:08 - superintendent of Broward County Public
02:10 - Schools which was one of the first
02:12 - school districts to partner with
02:14 - code.org to bring computer science to
02:16 - all of its students
02:17 - so
02:18 - Bob you want to come up here
02:20 - all right let's welcome Bob
02:25 - all right Katie thank you so much and
02:27 - hey welcome everyone uh before I get
02:30 - started I definitely gotta give a shout
02:32 - out to some of the Broward peeps in here
02:34 - in particular uh Lisa milankovic and the
02:37 - Educators who have worked so hard to
02:40 - really expand uh computer science uh
02:43 - education in Broward County I know uh
02:46 - when I started there a little over a
02:47 - decade ago I think we had a few hundred
02:50 - students engaged in computer science and
02:53 - I know when I left just a few months ago
02:56 - we were well over 50 000 students
03:00 - engaged so just a huge credit and uh
03:04 - please give those folks a round of
03:06 - applause please
03:11 - I also want to mention um cheese for
03:13 - change I'm just so proud to be working
03:16 - with that organization it's a bipartisan
03:19 - network of State Chiefs and District
03:22 - leaders there's over 50 of them and we
03:26 - tend to describe them as bold leaders
03:29 - that are focused on real change in their
03:31 - systems and we work diligently to
03:34 - support them through our technical
03:35 - assistance work where we raise millions
03:38 - of dollars to go into those systems and
03:41 - help them deal with some of their
03:43 - biggest challenges and priorities we
03:46 - also have a future cheese program which
03:47 - is a leadership development program 18
03:50 - months folks go through that and then we
03:53 - help get them placed in a system and
03:57 - then Provide support to them and we also
03:59 - do advocacy work on the hill and work
04:02 - with Folks at the White House as well in
04:04 - the Department of Education a couple of
04:07 - the members a couple of the State Chiefs
04:10 - here today are members and Dr Christina
04:13 - Grant and Penny Schwinn Penny's not here
04:15 - today but we are really thrilled to have
04:17 - them as part of that amazing network of
04:20 - leaders so today we have a few questions
04:23 - for this amazing group here I think just
04:27 - looking at everyone here you can see
04:28 - that computer science clearly isn't a
04:31 - political issue or partisan issue it's
04:33 - an education issue it really is
04:36 - something that we can all focus on and
04:38 - get behind and do what's right for our
04:40 - kids we have a series of questions and
04:43 - we want to make sure we hear from each
04:45 - and every one of these amazing leaders
04:47 - and we will try to keep the answers
04:51 - short around a couple minutes but we'll
04:54 - try to go through this uh the best we
04:56 - can so the first question I like to put
04:59 - on a table is we know education leaders
05:02 - across the country I have been facing a
05:05 - variety of issues in fact I think we've
05:08 - had a historic high in turnover and
05:10 - vacancy rates
05:11 - um so with all this going on and the
05:14 - challenges that we have I want to ask a
05:17 - couple of you why is it important to you
05:20 - to keep computer science top of mind and
05:24 - an education priority in the systems
05:28 - that you lead and I will ask our leader
05:31 - from Maine in Vermont I guess we'll go
05:33 - up to the New England region for this
05:36 - one and I'll start with um Pender Megan
05:41 - Let's uh what are your thoughts on that
05:43 - question
05:45 - it's on
05:47 - um well you know I didn't want to take
05:48 - Dan's talking points on this one but um
05:52 - we of course want to have our students
05:53 - in Maine and Across the Nation to have
05:55 - every competitive opportunity in the
05:59 - increasingly global
06:01 - competitive environment that they are
06:03 - facing when they leave school
06:05 - additionally we want our students to uh
06:08 - to have those critical thinking skills
06:11 - and the um the Curiosity the iterative
06:14 - design and all of those other types of
06:17 - skills that students gain when they are
06:19 - involved in computer science
06:22 - um I would say above all there is the
06:25 - sense that they would face the
06:27 - inevitable challenges in computer
06:29 - science and in in creating programs that
06:32 - will do and change what is happening
06:35 - right in front of their eyes that
06:36 - Fosters a sense of
06:39 - optimism and creativity when they face
06:42 - challenges throughout their lives and so
06:44 - it's a great way to have students
06:47 - lean into agency and creativity and
06:50 - finally I guess I would say that in a
06:52 - world that is
06:53 - increasingly nebulous when it comes to
06:56 - truth and where much of the truth that
06:58 - we all absorb or think that we are
07:00 - hearing is provided to us through
07:03 - technology permeating every aspect of
07:05 - Our Lives our students need to
07:07 - understand the principles and the
07:10 - processes that underlie that which is
07:12 - presented to us all where we are getting
07:16 - the information that creates the notion
07:19 - of of truth I think that is one of the
07:21 - most critical pieces they we need them
07:23 - to understand all of that deeply all
07:26 - right thank you Pender ain't that the
07:27 - truth all right Dr French what would you
07:31 - like to add to that yeah she uh she said
07:33 - it all pretty much uh but I would say um
07:37 - yeah I would agree uh and we do work
07:38 - closely together Maine and Vermont um I
07:41 - think demographically we're two of the
07:42 - oldest States from a population
07:43 - perspective
07:45 - um and I would agree our education
07:47 - systems uh are very similar heavily
07:49 - local control and we've certainly had
07:51 - our challenges so the results of the
07:53 - pandemic but I would also say that I
07:55 - think there's a lot of opportunity and
07:57 - as in particular I think there's
07:58 - opportunity around the system probably
08:00 - being more open for structural change
08:02 - than it ever has been so I think it's
08:05 - important particularly with computer
08:06 - science as we've seen today with a
08:08 - conference there's a lot of consensus
08:10 - there's a lot of urgency there's a lot
08:11 - of collaboration happening computer
08:13 - science can really help Advance those
08:15 - structural changes now to make our
08:17 - education system more responsive to the
08:20 - personal learning needs of students some
08:22 - of those structures we've discussed
08:24 - today such as curriculum standards
08:26 - licensing standards graduation
08:28 - requirements those structural things
08:30 - have been slow to change and computer
08:32 - science sits at the Nexus of a lot of
08:34 - those issues in its own right it's an
08:36 - academic discipline to a certain extent
08:38 - it's a creative art
08:40 - um but it does call into question I
08:42 - think in a positive way uh some of our
08:44 - more rigid categorizations of the
08:46 - academic structures in K-12 education
08:48 - I think computer science is also
08:50 - important to shine a light on some of
08:53 - the opportunity gaps and what I think we
08:55 - notice in rural parts of Northern New
08:57 - England what I won't call aspiration
08:59 - gaps but aspirational limitations I
09:02 - think we all saw when our systems
09:04 - literally pivoted overnight to remote
09:06 - learning the equity gaps that are out
09:09 - there they existed prior to the pandemic
09:11 - but what we increasingly notice I think
09:14 - in our rural States and this is probably
09:16 - true in any student population that
09:17 - feels disenfranchised or disconnected to
09:20 - our modern economy our students don't
09:23 - often have a sense of the possibilities
09:24 - of the future and I think computer
09:25 - science today can really serve an
09:27 - important inspiration function for them
09:30 - um I think too many of our students are
09:33 - passive consumers of technology and
09:35 - computer science can provide them the
09:37 - tools to empower them to we'd say a
09:39 - Northern New England look under the hood
09:40 - or maybe Tinker I don't know if you're
09:43 - familiar with tinkering that's a
09:44 - Northern New England phenomena I
09:46 - certainly wouldn't advocate for
09:48 - tinkering as a graduation standard but I
09:50 - think we could certainly harness the
09:53 - energy or behind tinkering and wrap some
09:55 - formality and make computer science the
09:57 - new tinkering to empower our students to
09:59 - create Better Lives themselves their
10:01 - families and their communities
10:03 - thank you
10:05 - um so uh the next one I'll have for um
10:08 - Kirsten and Jillian you guys are sitting
10:10 - right next to each other so that'll work
10:12 - um and uh Kirsten I I think I'm correct
10:15 - you're going to be the incoming
10:17 - president of the national
10:19 - um State superintendent Association so
10:22 - congratulations to you on that um you
10:24 - can find a better person to do that
10:26 - you've had a really great track record
10:29 - um in North Dakota
10:30 - so both of you have been long time
10:33 - supporters of computer science and what
10:37 - I'd like to know and I'm sure the folks
10:40 - sitting out in the audience would like
10:41 - to know are what are some of the most
10:43 - effective things that you would
10:45 - recommend State leaders can do to
10:48 - promote computer science especially as
10:50 - you think about how do you work with
10:52 - districts provide incentives to them Etc
10:54 - what are your thoughts on it
10:57 - thank you um first thank you for those
10:59 - kind words um Bob thank you for
11:01 - facilitating this and a thank you to
11:03 - code.org for convening this and bringing
11:05 - us all together and and consistently
11:07 - having this very important conversation
11:09 - among all stakeholders so I appreciate
11:11 - that
11:12 - um as I was thinking about this as this
11:14 - question uh what what can what did we do
11:17 - what did I do as a leader I think
11:21 - um I think the answers as I was going
11:23 - through I like to do things in three so
11:24 - there's three pieces of advice and this
11:26 - is not just to us as State Chiefs I
11:29 - think this holds true for any leader if
11:31 - you are a leader out there if you're a
11:33 - district leader if you're a building
11:34 - leader if if you are a division leader a
11:37 - department leader I think the first
11:39 - thing that you should do is use your
11:41 - voice use your voice to lift up to
11:44 - communicate to educate develop that
11:47 - 30-second elevator speech
11:49 - tailor that 32nd elevator speech to the
11:52 - passions and the motivations to the
11:54 - audience that you're speaking to and
11:56 - make sure that you're doing that often
11:58 - and with passion
12:00 - so using your voice is one thing you the
12:03 - second thing is use the authority that
12:04 - you already have there are all sorts of
12:07 - barriers out there that that could exist
12:11 - to getting in the way of progressing and
12:13 - making gains on these issues but each of
12:15 - us has as leaders have the authority and
12:18 - that's one of the first things that we
12:19 - did in North Dakota as we looked at the
12:21 - nine policies that were recommended by
12:23 - code.org which one of those needed
12:27 - needed action by someone outside of our
12:30 - department we set those aside a little
12:31 - bit and then we worked on the ones that
12:34 - did not need action outside of our
12:36 - agency outside of our Authority and we
12:38 - made those changes all of those changes
12:40 - that were within our Authority First the
12:43 - final thing that I would say is don't go
12:46 - this alone
12:47 - find Partners we would not have been
12:50 - able to accomplish what we've
12:51 - accomplished so far in in both the the
12:54 - momentum and the actual policy change
12:57 - without code.org and other partners with
13:00 - partners partners within our state other
13:02 - state agencies Commerce Arc I.T again
13:06 - code.org was with us every step of the
13:08 - way and I can't be more grateful I can't
13:10 - say enough words of gratitude to them
13:11 - for that but don't try and do this alone
13:14 - find those partners that share the
13:15 - intersections of need within your within
13:19 - your your ecosystem and lean on them and
13:23 - share the challenges and the credit when
13:25 - you are triumphant Jillian well that was
13:29 - a wonderful answer superintendent so I'd
13:32 - love to just say ditto but I better add
13:34 - a couple more things
13:35 - um to that and I I think I'll just start
13:37 - with this
13:39 - um you know as as State Chiefs we have
13:41 - so many opportunities to get out and
13:42 - about in classrooms and um when you see
13:45 - great computer science instruction
13:47 - happening at any grad level you know
13:49 - right away I think one of the most
13:52 - compelling cases for computer science or
13:55 - one of the most compelling examples of
13:57 - computer science is when an elementary
13:59 - teacher is teaching algorithmic thinking
14:02 - unplugged and um
14:05 - so one of the I I guess maybe pieces of
14:10 - advice that I have is that if you have
14:12 - reluctant computer science stakeholders
14:15 - take them to a classroom and it's one
14:19 - thing to go to a high school classroom
14:20 - where kids are working on apps or like
14:22 - literally working on computers it's
14:25 - quite another to see a grid drawn on a
14:28 - kindergarten floor and students figuring
14:30 - out with each other or solo how to move
14:33 - from one side of the grid to the other
14:35 - and that's coding and so recognizing
14:38 - that coding is happening in classrooms
14:40 - every single day and as state leaders
14:43 - really being able to label that as such
14:45 - like like being a profit for that saying
14:47 - no no coding is happening computer
14:50 - science is happening in our classrooms
14:52 - right now with or without but then the
14:54 - next step and maybe the deeper step is
14:57 - what Kirsten said recognizing the
14:59 - partners that you need to bring you
15:01 - along to help codify that with the nine
15:03 - policy areas with standard words with
15:06 - professional development and daily
15:09 - practice in the classroom and the
15:11 - partners are are in all shapes and sizes
15:14 - Kirsten named them all and I have to say
15:17 - that you know every other content area
15:19 - is kind of plug and play we know how to
15:21 - do for example standards for reading and
15:25 - language arts not so much with computer
15:27 - science and so we have to tap into some
15:30 - Partnerships that maybe we have not
15:32 - historically had code.org has been a
15:35 - huge partner with us and when Sean first
15:38 - came to Wyoming where I was a state
15:40 - chief before Virginia
15:42 - we had a conversation you're not a
15:45 - lobbyist you're not a vendor you're a
15:49 - partner you're a thought partner you are
15:51 - an implementation partner in fact
15:54 - code.org and Sean in particular
15:57 - was the first person from out of state
15:59 - that we ever put on a committee to help
16:01 - us develop our standards in Wyoming for
16:04 - computer science That's How Deep The
16:07 - Partnerships need to run with higher
16:08 - education with business and industry
16:10 - with school school districts with
16:13 - legislators and with others and then
16:16 - finally I would just um I would I would
16:18 - just add that um I think a lot of us
16:21 - have have maybe tried some initiatives
16:23 - but haven't quite nailed them and it's
16:26 - important as state leaders and as school
16:28 - district leaders that we are really
16:30 - thinking about the infrastructure with a
16:33 - computer science plan and and with with
16:37 - what the long-term goals are around
16:40 - computer science and uh you know
16:43 - sometimes that's a little bit of an
16:44 - afterthought for us as Leaders because
16:46 - there's a lot of Glitz and glamor in
16:48 - computer science that's easy to distract
16:50 - us from what we need to do as Leaders
16:53 - which is building that core building
16:55 - that infrastructure
16:57 - all right well thank you thank you both
16:58 - so definitely make sure you have
17:01 - infrastructure but don't build it alone
17:02 - look for some help uh and some Partners
17:05 - out there well you know I've been in a
17:07 - room with all these leaders earlier
17:09 - today and I can tell you
17:11 - um they're very supportive set of
17:12 - colleagues they share ideas best
17:15 - practices they want to help each other
17:16 - uh but I know you all like to compete
17:18 - against each other right
17:20 - um and and so
17:22 - um what I'd like to ask
17:24 - um Tiffany is what's one thing that
17:28 - you've done really well in South Dakota
17:31 - that you'd like to brag about
17:33 - here in front of your colleagues in this
17:36 - fine audience that we have I'm happy to
17:39 - take you up on that offer I
17:42 - I think the biggest thing that we've
17:43 - done is think big and then build the
17:45 - education system around it to support
17:47 - students in a big pathway so I'll take
17:50 - you back to April of 2019 my first day
17:52 - on the job with Governor gnome we jumped
17:55 - across the state to Madison South Dakota
17:56 - where Dakota State University is and had
17:59 - a conversation with President Jose Marie
18:01 - Griffis and she laid out for us her
18:03 - vision for a brand new industry in the
18:06 - state cyber security it was a great day
18:08 - thinking really really big about what
18:10 - can we do to build a whole new industry
18:12 - in the state
18:14 - and I'll fast forward you now to March
18:16 - of 2020 this last March Governor gnome
18:18 - signed a 90 million dollar package
18:20 - public private partnership to start a
18:24 - new industry so that 90 million dollars
18:26 - is going to build a research lab for
18:28 - cyber security in South Dakota it's
18:30 - doubling the size of our cyber security
18:32 - programs at the college level and it's
18:35 - making dual credit computer science
18:37 - coursework available in every High
18:39 - School across the state so through this
18:42 - dual credit program isn't that awesome
18:44 - yeah it's so exciting
18:47 - through this dual credit program we're
18:49 - calling it the governor's cyber Security
18:51 - Academy
18:52 - not only are high school students
18:54 - learning directly from
18:56 - world-renowned College faculty in
18:59 - computer science they're getting peer
19:01 - mentorship from college students who are
19:03 - in computer science classes so they've
19:05 - got that support network as they're
19:07 - taking these challenging courses and
19:09 - we're building a digital simulation lab
19:12 - so that students are building skills in
19:14 - safe environments through their learning
19:16 - so super excited that this investment is
19:20 - helping us go big and then on the other
19:23 - end of this system we're pairing that
19:25 - with initiatives in K5 stem education
19:27 - heavy and computer science computer
19:30 - science standards professional
19:31 - development certification for our K-12
19:33 - teachers to make sure from the earliest
19:35 - days a kindergarten student has the
19:37 - opportunity to be aware of and build an
19:40 - engagement with computer science so very
19:42 - excited to go big and build the
19:44 - infrastructure around the whole system
19:46 - oh thank you I thought things are a
19:48 - little quiet out in South Dakota but you
19:49 - guys are busy
19:51 - all right
19:52 - um well you know there's a I think
19:54 - there's at least five states who have
19:56 - made computer science a graduation
19:58 - requirement
19:59 - um South Carolina has certainly done
20:01 - this for a number of years they've been
20:04 - kind of leader on that front it
20:06 - certainly one of the Hallmarks of
20:08 - maturity and making some really great
20:10 - progress at a state level to move on
20:13 - computer science forward so I'd like to
20:16 - ask Molly you know what have you kind of
20:19 - learned during that time and what and
20:20 - specifically what type of outcomes have
20:23 - you achieved in South Carolina after
20:25 - having moved and been doing this work
20:28 - for so long thanks Bob and I give a big
20:31 - shout out to the team from South
20:32 - Carolina who has had great vision
20:34 - actually I was around in 2005 not in
20:39 - this job but serving as a lobbyist at
20:42 - the Department of Education and even a
20:44 - few years before that when we began
20:45 - began the effort it was through the
20:47 - education Economic Development Donna you
20:50 - mentioned that earlier today and we've
20:52 - come an awful long way our outcomes are
20:55 - students learning and being engaged in
20:59 - computer science one of our outcomes
21:02 - that we're most proud of if you saw in
21:04 - the report today we have solved the
21:06 - gender gap all of our girls our girls
21:09 - take the courses they're involved their
21:10 - stem programs all across the state and
21:13 - we are so thrilled and proud of that I
21:16 - think I was inspired Monday that was
21:20 - only two days ago but we had our
21:22 - computer science Summit in Greenville
21:24 - South Carolina governor Hutchinson came
21:26 - over from Arkansas and our governor was
21:27 - there with us the hit of the day though
21:30 - were the four students who were on the
21:32 - stage and South Carolina is a state of
21:36 - really two South Carolina's very fluent
21:39 - fast-growing world-class schools
21:41 - world-class industry from all around the
21:43 - world and then there's rural South
21:45 - Carolina with little industry and lots
21:48 - of poverty
21:50 - but to be able to see that those four
21:53 - students on the stage represented both
21:56 - sides of South Carolina
21:57 - and they represented students who were
22:00 - so excited and engaged
22:03 - and I really think we've saved students
22:07 - we've saved lives and definitely changed
22:10 - lives because we require this and
22:13 - because we're making the access we're
22:15 - making it available to every child in
22:18 - South Carolina no matter where they live
22:19 - and that's the most important thing some
22:22 - students come running to participate
22:24 - because their parents can tell them
22:26 - about the opportunities and they know
22:29 - why this is a good thing for them to be
22:31 - involved with
22:32 - other students need us to like that
22:35 - spark
22:36 - and that's the most important thing but
22:38 - to see those young men and women who
22:42 - quite honestly
22:43 - um most of them have never traveled
22:45 - outside the state maybe not even outside
22:47 - their County to talk about that they
22:50 - want to go to MIT
22:52 - or they went to a program at the
22:53 - University of Texas I'm trying to I now
22:56 - I was worried about that on the way home
22:57 - we don't need them leaving the state
23:00 - kind of upset about that but um
23:04 - to see how engaged they were and that in
23:07 - our small rural state that we have
23:09 - required this opportunity and giving the
23:12 - access now we've got a ways to go and
23:15 - working even harder
23:17 - but we're committed to that and code.org
23:20 - has held our hand all the way through
23:22 - and we appreciate that but we've got
23:24 - more to do but it is really seeing the
23:27 - greatest thrilled is seeing the students
23:29 - and the possibilities that they have now
23:32 - for their Futures uh thank you Molly
23:34 - just a great man so you know sometimes
23:37 - when we do this work we're always trying
23:40 - to find data points and measures of how
23:43 - it's going but you know ultimately it's
23:46 - about how this impacts human lives and
23:50 - the stories around that and so we always
23:52 - need to keep that in mind so thank you
23:55 - Molly for uh reminding us of of that
23:59 - um you know we Arkansas and Nevada have
24:02 - also have graduation requirements and
24:05 - they've also implemented nine the nine
24:08 - recommended policies out there as well
24:10 - so I'd like to pitch it to
24:13 - um Johnny and Joan and ask them you know
24:17 - what's next for you and and how will you
24:20 - continue to measure success in your
24:22 - States maybe we'll start with Johnny key
24:25 - from Arkansas
24:26 - thank you Bob uh you know that's a great
24:29 - question and that's a question that
24:30 - probably many of my colleagues up here
24:32 - ask our seniors every year when we meet
24:36 - a senior student we say what's next you
24:38 - know I used to say where are you going
24:39 - to college and you know now I just say
24:42 - what's next because there are so many
24:43 - different avenues for students to pursue
24:47 - post-secondary and that's one one of the
24:49 - things we need to do in Arkansas now
24:51 - that we have that graduation requirement
24:53 - like okay I graduated I've done this I'm
24:57 - very interested in it and maybe I've
24:58 - even gone so far as to get some type of
25:02 - certification some proficiency some
25:04 - skills that I can demonstrate what do I
25:07 - do with it now what do we do to create
25:09 - those Pathways so we are working to take
25:13 - those next steps working with higher
25:15 - education working with industry we have
25:17 - a pretty robust defense industry sector
25:20 - in our state looking for opportunities
25:23 - to connect
25:25 - students to those Pathways you may have
25:28 - heard of Walmart that's that's in
25:31 - Arkansas and we know that Walmart has
25:33 - you know thousands of open I.T data jobs
25:38 - every year that they can't fill they
25:41 - can't fill them from anywhere
25:43 - and I was a couple weeks ago I was in
25:46 - Bentonville spoke with a group of
25:47 - students and they were describing their
25:49 - work-based learning opportunities that
25:52 - they have with Walmart
25:54 - one of the areas we need to improve is
25:57 - making those opportunities available not
25:58 - just for the students in Bentonville but
26:01 - opportunities for the the typically
26:04 - underrepresented students all over the
26:06 - state to give the balance with the girls
26:09 - that are interested in that as well to
26:12 - find those work based opportunities at
26:16 - work based learning in areas across the
26:19 - state so that that our momentum doesn't
26:22 - stop that it just it keeps going we keep
26:24 - building on what we've we've learned and
26:27 - we keep stealing great ideas from other
26:29 - states and Implement those
26:34 - no competition there at all we keep uh
26:36 - We've we brought our flags to this
26:39 - conference by the way if you haven't
26:41 - seen Nevada's Flags they are up in the
26:43 - front table here battleborn I'm very
26:46 - fortunate that we also have 14 people
26:49 - from Nevada here at this conference
26:51 - that's how invested we are in this work
26:54 - one of them is our vice president of our
26:57 - state board of education Mark Newburn
27:00 - Mark there you go what's really nice yes
27:03 - please give them a round of applause
27:08 - this is um the work and my colleagues
27:11 - talked about human capital right we talk
27:13 - about computer science and some people
27:14 - like oh computer science it must be you
27:16 - know something behind the curtain but it
27:18 - really is it's about people and and who
27:22 - we are and and where we're going into
27:24 - the future and so I'm very honored that
27:27 - Mark uh led the work in our state to
27:30 - make sure that all nine policies were
27:33 - adopted with our legislature it was not
27:36 - an easy lift but it was very intentional
27:38 - and also he is a computer scientist
27:42 - himself
27:43 - right so leveraging intellectual Capital
27:47 - that is there to make sure that it
27:49 - happens so we have as a state all nine
27:51 - policies in place as well as the
27:53 - graduation requirements for us now those
27:56 - policies are there but what is happening
27:58 - with our students in the classroom we're
28:02 - digging deep with our team that is here
28:04 - making sure that from pre-k all the way
28:08 - through 12 and then out the door onto
28:11 - higher ed post-secondary work that our
28:15 - students that it is deep work that is
28:18 - happening in the classrooms so policy as
28:22 - we said great it's in place but is it
28:25 - happening in the classroom and what does
28:27 - it look like I really loved when Jillian
28:29 - said making sure you're bringing people
28:31 - in the into the classroom as well
28:33 - our next phase is actually and I know
28:36 - many of you I lean on my colleagues who
28:39 - have had I think Virginia is on version
28:40 - 4.0 of profile of a learner and when we
28:46 - are going to move forward in that work
28:49 - it is bringing our students to the table
28:54 - bringing our business partners to the
28:57 - table and building it from the ground up
29:00 - and we know that computer science will
29:04 - be a major component of that work as we
29:09 - move forward so building up we had a
29:12 - conversation earlier about what
29:14 - assessments would look like in the
29:15 - future when you think about how computer
29:17 - science and all of that work can move it
29:21 - forward there is such great
29:22 - opportunities at this moment in time and
29:25 - in Nevada we're hoping that you'll lead
29:27 - with us and partner with us to that next
29:30 - generation of not just saying computer
29:32 - science being added into or on top of
29:35 - but developing from the ground up and
29:38 - leading to where we're going as a nation
29:41 - and thanks Joe and I that's a a great
29:44 - reminder of a way to integrate this
29:47 - um into everyone's thinking and envision
29:49 - of what we want for our children is as
29:52 - you develop things like profile of a
29:54 - learner profile of a graduate
29:56 - um that really can help really set the
29:58 - stage and it's a great way to have a
30:00 - broad community and Statewide
30:02 - conversations around this topic Dr Grant
30:07 - um you know congratulations on your
30:09 - start as a bowl leader in DC and I know
30:12 - there's one thing that you can certainly
30:14 - brag about and that is that DC has the
30:18 - highest percentage of female students
30:20 - taking advanced placement computer
30:21 - science in the nation at 36 percent
30:29 - but we know that's not the end right
30:31 - there's always something to work on
30:33 - um and there are still some disparities
30:35 - in participation in computer science as
30:37 - they continue
30:39 - um so uh what are you thinking about
30:41 - doing to increase uh the number of
30:43 - historically underrepresented
30:46 - um students enrolling in computer
30:47 - science courses Dr Grant thanks Bob um
30:50 - we are competitive but I do want to
30:53 - extend a thanks to code.org and all of
30:55 - you for bringing us together uh it is
30:58 - always a joy to be with our colleagues
31:00 - uh you can imagine that we don't see
31:02 - each other too often and today has been
31:04 - a great day of learning and excited to
31:07 - tell you so much about what we've done
31:09 - but really inspired in taking copious
31:12 - notes on all the work we have to do to
31:14 - push the work forward and I would say in
31:16 - DC this morning you got an opportunity
31:18 - to hear about one school digital
31:20 - Pioneers Academy where Michelle has told
31:23 - you that we are going to significantly
31:24 - increase the amount of students and
31:26 - particularly our young women who are
31:28 - taking Advan chance placement courses
31:30 - but the big question we're asking
31:32 - ourselves in Washington DC is how do we
31:34 - reimagine high schools that are designed
31:36 - around where children are and where they
31:38 - need to be as it relates to having
31:41 - access to high-wage high earning jobs
31:43 - and being residents that could be viable
31:46 - part part of our economic recovery and
31:50 - so a lot of our investments uh to the
31:52 - tune of 30 million dollars this year 35
31:55 - million dollars next year have been
31:57 - around what we're calling reimagining
31:59 - high schools and so I've been told I
32:02 - only have two minutes and so I'm going
32:04 - to respect the time but one example we
32:07 - launched this summer and I think it's
32:09 - important to note one as we talk to our
32:12 - Educators our principals we have endured
32:17 - unbelievable realities over the last set
32:20 - of years it is called the historic once
32:22 - in a lifetime event for a reason yet and
32:25 - still we drew a line in the sand and
32:27 - said we know that our children need to
32:29 - have access to Computer Science
32:31 - Education and be on Pathway to earn
32:34 - credentials in cyber security I.T
32:37 - ensuring as Michelle said that our
32:39 - students have access to the computer
32:41 - science education but they are also
32:43 - College and Career ready and so this
32:45 - summer last month we launched our
32:47 - Advanced Technical Center and the
32:49 - advanced Technical Center is a Twist on
32:51 - what we used to think about when we talk
32:54 - about Career and Technical education and
32:56 - so we are moving in directions of not
32:58 - opening new schools but opening new
33:00 - places that regardless of governance
33:02 - structures so we have half of our
33:04 - children in traditional Public Schools
33:06 - the other half of our children are in
33:08 - public charter schools regardless of
33:10 - where a child goes to school they can
33:11 - have access to the ATC and what that
33:14 - looks like is we've partnered with our
33:15 - higher University Partners this year we
33:18 - launched on Trinity University's campus
33:20 - with 150 Scholars who are on path to
33:23 - take career computer science coursework
33:26 - and be on a path to earn credentialing
33:28 - in cyber security and I.T while they're
33:31 - still in high school and so these
33:33 - students are probably in school right
33:35 - now
33:36 - having access to coursework on a
33:39 - computer on a college campus earning
33:41 - their credits and then we are providing
33:44 - resources to ensure that if those
33:45 - students graduate and want to remain a
33:48 - student at Trinity they could actually
33:49 - continue their education and so that's
33:52 - one example of a through line to how
33:55 - we're rethinking Computer Science
33:56 - Education and I'll tell you this was a
34:00 - conversation we had had earlier there
34:02 - was so much you know it's so hard to
34:05 - think about something new as we navigate
34:08 - all the twists and turns and I think
34:11 - it's been said over and over again our
34:13 - Target enrollment number for this fall
34:16 - was 50 students
34:17 - and we stood up the program our
34:20 - University president was delighted to to
34:22 - host our children on their campus we had
34:25 - 130 children enroll all across DC
34:29 - showing up in a wide array of uniforms
34:31 - before the school year started so we
34:34 - launched this program before the actual
34:36 - first day of school and all we did was
34:38 - provide the children with transportation
34:40 - and they all showed up and so it was it
34:43 - was a reminder that we are not designing
34:45 - the system for adults
34:47 - we are designing our system for our
34:50 - children and when we do when we have the
34:52 - right designs in place and we have the
34:54 - right offerings children will show up
34:57 - and exceed our expectations and so we've
34:59 - already blown our Target for FY 23 and
35:02 - 24 and that tells us our children are
35:05 - ready to embrace the future and we
35:08 - cannot be the barriers to their own
35:10 - success because in fact they will be
35:12 - taking care of us all one day we have to
35:15 - make sure we get that right
35:16 - thank you Dr Grant
35:19 - um just a a great example
35:22 - um kind of reminds me of this truism I
35:25 - have which is uh Talent is equally
35:27 - distributed but opportunity not so much
35:31 - right and so by doing what you've just
35:33 - described it's a way to create those
35:36 - opportunities for our students because
35:39 - we know if we give them those chances
35:40 - they will they will be able to succeed
35:43 - you know Alabama and New Jersey Jersey
35:48 - have also well they've implemented seven
35:51 - of the nine policies recommended by
35:54 - co.org and so I'd like to ask our folks
35:58 - from Alabama and New Jersey you know
36:00 - what are some of the key lessons uh that
36:03 - they've learned for that so Eric Mackey
36:05 - and Dr Angelica Allen McMillan I'll have
36:09 - you take the last well I guess next to
36:12 - our last question here so I saw Angelica
36:14 - when did you start wonderful well thank
36:17 - you again to code.org and to to all of
36:20 - you for being with us today as far as
36:23 - Lessons Learned I I am so pleased to
36:26 - share our success in taking off from the
36:30 - runway that we began Paving the road on
36:34 - from 2018
36:35 - with the formulation of our computer
36:39 - science Advisory Board we brought
36:41 - together those who are willing those who
36:43 - were interested and those who were able
36:45 - and from their work you year later we
36:48 - were able to produce a document
36:50 - that allows us to now in 2022 have
36:55 - computer science standards implemented
36:59 - in grades K through 12. and that was a
37:02 - long journey that took the corralling of
37:06 - many entities but I want to acknowledge
37:08 - our state board of education for
37:11 - honoring the work set forward by
37:13 - Governor Murphy when you think about
37:15 - advancing a new initiative I go back to
37:18 - my days as a classroom teacher there's
37:19 - always so much on the plate and here
37:21 - comes another great idea but I don't
37:24 - have room for it and so the
37:26 - Administration has worked diligently to
37:29 - remove obsolete items from the plate so
37:33 - that we have room for our new items but
37:35 - that was just the beginning we've worked
37:38 - with our regulatory officers to ensure
37:41 - that we are able to uh codify the needed
37:47 - licensure requirements for computer
37:49 - science teachers so we started and said
37:52 - hey
37:52 - superintendents if you have a teacher
37:54 - who is interested and meets your
37:56 - standards offer a course in computer
37:58 - science because we did not want to limit
38:01 - the possibilities and looking at us
38:03 - today we are scheduled for a May 2023
38:08 - rollout of the certification at the high
38:11 - school level as well as some
38:13 - endorsements for the elementary level
38:16 - our agency has also supported computer
38:19 - science initiatives with two million
38:21 - dollars since 2018 in the annual budget
38:25 - and so that has helped us to partner
38:27 - with institutions of higher education to
38:30 - form computer hubs and to date we've had
38:33 - approximately 700 Educators take courses
38:37 - at these hubs so we see that the
38:39 - teachers are interested we know that the
38:41 - students are willing but I have to
38:43 - acknowledge my team we have Daryl here
38:46 - who has served since its Inception of
38:49 - the on The Advisory Board since 2018 and
38:52 - we have Gilbert Gonzalez sitting here
38:53 - cheering me on the front row as our uh
38:56 - director of The Office of innovation and
38:58 - why am I raising their names because we
39:00 - work to identify the names of the
39:03 - teachers of the students and we are
39:06 - Guided by the work of a teacher who said
39:08 - I'm I have this drive but my
39:11 - administrator won't let me do this and
39:14 - and and and we need your help State
39:16 - Department of Education what can you do
39:17 - and now we can say we have answered the
39:20 - call by providing the standards that now
39:23 - clear the path forward for you to be
39:25 - Innovative in your classroom thank you
39:27 - thank you all right we'll move from the
39:29 - Garden State over to Eric
39:31 - to be last
39:33 - there's everything all so much good
39:36 - stuff's been said already but uh when
39:37 - you talk about Lessons Learned like
39:39 - Angelica said we we've learned how to
39:42 - push things forward and I would say one
39:44 - of the biggest lessons we learned was
39:46 - build a good team and build a team
39:48 - that's horizontal and vertical so part
39:50 - of my team are here I've got a couple of
39:52 - people from our department who are
39:53 - wonderful that work in Career Tech and
39:55 - in certification with us today but we
39:59 - also have a big non-profit in the state
40:02 - that does a lot of teacher education
40:03 - we've got a couple of those folks here
40:05 - with us today we identified a legislator
40:08 - early on when we passed the legislation
40:11 - who is not a computer science person
40:13 - somebody had a computer science person
40:15 - is there a policy maker iris is a lawyer
40:18 - but he really bought into the importance
40:20 - of teaching computer science and he owns
40:23 - that topic and every year he calls me
40:25 - and he says Eric do we are we getting
40:27 - enough for my project is there enough
40:29 - money in the budget do we need to do
40:31 - anything else do we need to tweet the
40:34 - law so we built this team of policy
40:37 - makers legislators our governor has has
40:39 - really been out front taking the lead on
40:42 - it our state school board but then we
40:44 - had to build this vertical team too
40:46 - because as we all know you can do all
40:48 - the state policies and everything can
40:50 - look really good and you have a lot of
40:51 - press conferences but if the districts
40:53 - don't buy into it and the School
40:55 - principles I and the teachers then it
40:58 - never happens and that's where we again
41:00 - built this really good team of going out
41:02 - into our schools and training people and
41:04 - getting people to buy into
41:05 - what we were trying to do to achieve and
41:09 - now we've achieved all nine of the
41:11 - code.org policy goals and and we feel
41:13 - good about where we're going we don't
41:15 - have everything in place we want more
41:18 - students participating we want to make
41:20 - sure that we're reaching our rural
41:22 - communities where they have fewer
41:23 - resources and and we don't want to leave
41:26 - them behind we want everybody to to
41:28 - catch this wave and move forward because
41:30 - as we all know this is um it is the
41:33 - future has already been set out here and
41:35 - you know everybody here I know has had
41:38 - to build that team and the folks who are
41:40 - here are parts of those teams because
41:42 - they they they believe it or they
41:44 - wouldn't be here
41:45 - well thank you I I know it's uh toward
41:49 - the end of the day here and we've got
41:51 - our our reception and cocktail coming up
41:54 - soon uh but I'd like you all to think
41:57 - about this you've got over 40
42:00 - um you know District leaders here I
42:03 - think there's over 60 uh Regional
42:05 - organizations as well so these are your
42:08 - folks right so if you could in just a
42:11 - few words like one sentence each of you
42:13 - just go around and just leave them with
42:17 - an inspirational message to inspire them
42:19 - to continue to do this work amidst all
42:22 - the other challenges and everything they
42:24 - have what would you say to them we'll
42:26 - start in the back and work our way all
42:29 - the way back around to Dr Grant so I
42:33 - would say that in the history of mankind
42:36 - there's always been times where someone
42:39 - decided what was important to teach
42:41 - their kids their young people
42:44 - and at some point in the history of this
42:46 - nation we decided that four years of
42:48 - English and four years of math and three
42:50 - years of science all of those things
42:52 - were important this is the time that we
42:55 - as a society Society need to decide
42:57 - computer science needs to join all the
43:01 - rest of those subjects as a necessity
43:03 - for our students
43:08 - please
43:10 - yeah absolutely and and everybody in
43:12 - this room is a believer in this topic
43:14 - that's why we're all here that's why you
43:16 - took time out of your schedule to be
43:17 - here when we run into to people who
43:20 - doubt or who have excuses are really
43:22 - good reasons why we shouldn't do it I
43:25 - think the answer has to be yes but we
43:28 - are going to do it so let's get beyond
43:30 - that
43:34 - and I would say take the risk be
43:37 - pre-forgiven to get out there and try
43:39 - and keep it as real and authentic as
43:41 - possible embed this work in real
43:43 - authentic project-based learning
43:48 - I think sometimes when we're faced with
43:51 - newness we just need permission to go
43:53 - forward and do great things so if you
43:55 - need permission today to run solid with
43:58 - Computer Science Education at whatever
44:00 - grade level you've got my permission you
44:02 - can talk to these folks later about what
44:04 - that means in your state but absolutely
44:06 - have permission to go forward and do
44:08 - great things
44:12 - I would just say as someone who grew up
44:16 - in the rural area go forth do great
44:18 - things and don't forget all the students
44:21 - all across your state because they
44:23 - deserve the opportunity too everyone
44:25 - deserves the opportunity
44:28 - [Applause]
44:30 - uh thank you I say break a lot of glass
44:33 - and then spend time cleaning it up and
44:35 - break more glass and just enjoy that
44:37 - process that's what this is all about
44:42 - I would just say I want to start with
44:44 - gratitude I always try to start with
44:45 - gratitude um thank you for all that the
44:47 - work has been that you've already done I
44:50 - would say I know that we're tired we can
44:53 - recognize that we're tired but so it's
44:56 - it's easy to just you know shut your
44:58 - door and do the work alone but I would
45:00 - say to remind everybody that you can go
45:02 - you can probably go swiftly alone but
45:06 - you'll go further together and my
45:09 - favorite Latin saying is this and I'm
45:10 - not going to attempt to say it in Latin
45:12 - but it is it translates into success is
45:15 - sweeter with difficulty so
45:18 - [Applause]
45:22 - I think I'm going to be the teacher's
45:23 - pet but whenever there is a barrier
45:27 - I I honestly I can't tell you the number
45:29 - of times that I've read hottie's
45:32 - biography and how he came to America and
45:36 - how he learned to code and there are
45:38 - stories like that all over so think
45:41 - about hottie's story when there's a
45:43 - barrier that's too difficult to overcome
45:45 - and then find those same stories and in
45:48 - your in your state and community
45:51 - thank you
45:53 - being a chief sometimes you feel you're
45:56 - alone and so I want you all to know that
46:00 - you are not alone I am not alone I have
46:03 - my colleagues here on this stage You Are
46:05 - Not Alone we are in this together we
46:08 - will lift each other up be bold be brave
46:12 - stay focused on the children and enjoy
46:15 - each and every moment as we all continue
46:18 - to move forward together
46:23 - now I just want to say uh thank you I
46:25 - think you know the issues of aspiration
46:28 - um really come down to having Role
46:29 - Models working with kids every single
46:31 - day so thank you for all of you work
46:33 - with kids with computer science not only
46:35 - sharing your skills but also your
46:37 - excitement and the fun of computer
46:38 - science it's really appreciated
46:42 - [Applause]
46:44 - pressure
46:48 - so you got some time to think about it a
46:50 - little bit I did uh no I think a couple
46:51 - of things you know as we were as we
46:53 - hopefully are moving away from the
46:56 - realities of the pandemic it is just
46:58 - true and noted that computer science
47:00 - saved us all so when we think about what
47:03 - we've all experienced technology is what
47:05 - got us to this place and it would be I
47:09 - think we all use the adage of never
47:11 - wasting a crisis we learned so much in
47:14 - the last three years that really does
47:16 - set the foundation for why all of us
47:18 - wherever we are in our journey are
47:20 - aligned on the importance of computer
47:21 - science education instruction and
47:24 - preparedness so that when the next thing
47:26 - comes we'll be further along in terms of
47:28 - how we respond and that's directly
47:30 - connected to the education of our
47:32 - children a fun fact is that mache has
47:35 - known me since I was a first year
47:36 - teacher and so I am going to end my
47:40 - thoughts with what she shared which is
47:42 - computer science for all for real it's a
47:45 - critical Equity conversation we ground
47:48 - equity and in lots of different ways but
47:51 - Equity is directly connected to access
47:53 - and you've heard every single person on
47:55 - this stage talk about how Urban rural
47:59 - north south east west if we can ensure
48:01 - that our children have access to
48:04 - Computer Science Education and that they
48:06 - are credentialed they will be ready for
48:08 - any challenge that they face as citizens
48:11 - of this United States of America and
48:13 - that's how we should ground ourselves as
48:15 - we think about what we're learning today
48:16 - and how we take that back into our
48:19 - communities
48:20 - well thank you
48:23 - well thank you all and I'll just throw a
48:27 - final thought in there I mean when you
48:29 - think about all of the systems that you
48:32 - all represent and the millions of
48:35 - students uh that you can uh impact
48:39 - um if you can't do it there's no one
48:41 - else to get it done the last thing I'll
48:44 - say to you is that yes this work is hard
48:46 - you've got your own personal challenges
48:49 - that you're dealing with but I always
48:51 - tell folks that even on your worst day
48:54 - you're going to be some kids best hope
48:56 - and that should keep you all going so
48:59 - thank you all and thank you to everyone
49:00 - for being here
49:03 - foreign
