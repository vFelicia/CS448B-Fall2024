00:05 - Hi, I'm Ryan
00:07 - and I'm the Head of Software
at Zipline.
00:09 - Zipline operates across Africa
00:12 - using drones to make life-saving blood deliveries.
00:16 - We deliver medical products like blood and vaccines
00:18 - to places that otherwise can't be reached.
00:24 - We all deal with different types of
problems every day...
00:30 - And one way or another we come up with solutions.
00:33 - But did you know there's actually a series of steps you can take
00:36 - for solving any problem?
00:38 - It's called the Problem Solving Process
00:40 - and it has four basic parts.
00:44 - One: Define - identify the problem.
00:49 - Two: Prepare - research previous solutions and brainstorm new ones.
00:55 - Three: Try - put a plan into action
00:58 - and test to see what works.
01:01 - Four: Reflect - review what worked and what didn't
01:06 - and how you might change your approach in the future.
01:09 - Let's take a look at how this
process is used in the real world
01:13 - by looking at where I work -
Zipline.
01:16 - At Zipline we started by defining the problem.
01:19 - First, when people need blood they need blood fast.
01:22 - Second, blood is very hard to store
01:25 - because there are many different types
01:26 - and it expires quickly.
01:28 - And third, most of the world does
not have roads
01:30 - we can rely on for delivery.
01:33 - The next step was to prepare a
solution.
01:36 - First we travel to Africa and met with doctors,
01:39 - the people on the ground
01:40 - who are most familiar with these problems.
01:43 - We learned that storing the
blood in one place
01:45 - would really help
01:47 - if only there was some way of getting the blood
01:49 - from that place to remote clinics on demand.
01:53 - Next we came up with all kinds
of ideas
01:56 - and really let our imaginations fly.
02:01 - The solution we thought might work
was an airplane shaped drone
02:04 - that could fly really far,
02:06 - really fast,
02:07 - over all kinds of rough terrain.
02:10 - When it flew over its destination
02:12 - it would parachute drop a package of blood to the doctors on the ground,
02:16 - then return home.
02:20 - Now it was time to try this all out.
02:22 - Thanks to previous medical research we knew techniques
02:25 - for building a blood storage facility.
02:27 - So we built one in a central location
02:29 - so that we could deliver blood to almost anywhere in the country.
02:33 - Then we built drones...
02:35 - a lot of drones.
02:37 - We tested how to fly the drones,
02:39 - turn them around,
02:40 - and recover them.
02:41 - And as we tried we had successes and we had plenty of failures.
02:47 - We quickly learned that
02:48 - dropping the blood from the sky
02:49 - worked really well.
02:50 - But we also learned problems
02:52 - like weather and hardware failures could
slow us down a lot.
02:55 - So as we tried we had to go back
02:58 - and prepare new solutions, as
we defined new problems.
03:03 - Finally we had something that worked!
03:10 - It was time to look at what we had done
03:12 - and really reflect on how it had gone.
03:16 - We reflected on our original definition of the problem
03:18 - and asked if our solution was better or worse
03:20 - than what existed before?
03:23 - We even started to think about
how our solution might be used
03:26 - to address other problems.
03:28 - Could it work for delivering medicine or even organs?
03:31 - Could it work in reverse and collect items
from distant locations?
03:34 - And could we get this solution to work in other countries?
03:37 - For each of these questions we went back
03:40 - and we redefined our process
03:41 - and we made it better.
03:44 - The Problem Solving Process works in all kinds of areas...
03:47 - Creative.
03:48 - Personal.
03:49 - Existential?
03:50 - You name it!
03:51 - By using these four steps,
03:53 - you can figure out a process to make anything work!
