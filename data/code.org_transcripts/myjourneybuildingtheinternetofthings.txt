00:08 - good morning everyone my name is pat
00:11 - young praditt and i'm co.org's chief
00:13 - academic officer
00:14 - welcome to cs journeys class chats my
00:17 - journey building the internet of things
00:20 - i'm so excited to be with you all today
00:22 - i'd like to introduce our speaker wale
00:26 - oliday hin uh from amazon
00:29 - wallet
00:30 - uh
00:31 - hi have you um
00:33 - could you introduce yourself your role
00:35 - at amazon and also tell us a little bit
00:37 - about what you'd like to do outside of
00:39 - work
00:40 - awesome awesome pat really excited to be
00:42 - here today too so my name is wale
00:45 - oladahin
00:46 - everyone calls me wale
00:48 - i am actually the head of solution
00:50 - architects in internet of things so
00:53 - connecting you know devices and you know
00:56 - assets to the cloud um so i've been at
00:58 - amazon for seven years uh and funny
01:01 - enough outside of technology i actually
01:03 - was a uh dancer um
01:07 - i'll share some photos but
01:09 - i uh
01:11 - was a professional salsa dancer for
01:13 - several years so that's me dancing in
01:16 - istanbul and uh also dancing with one of
01:19 - my partners
01:20 - uh and then before that i was actually a
01:22 - breakdancer so you know outside of work
01:25 - having something fun to do beyond just
01:27 - you know sitting behind a keyboard
01:30 - wow
01:31 - uh
01:32 - yeah i don't know how many salsa dancers
01:33 - or break dancers are out out there in
01:35 - the in the audience but um
01:37 - you know you know what because you're a
01:39 - salsa dancer
01:41 - i gotta tell you uh i have tried salsa
01:44 - dancing in the past and
01:46 - i rate his weakness is my timing i just
01:49 - keep
01:50 - timing down like i i see it done
01:52 - and i feel the music but my timing is
01:54 - just off so ballet
01:57 - i was thinking could you uh show me just
02:00 - the basic movements and maybe like a
02:01 - turn as well
02:03 - yeah and actually uh students out there
02:06 - classes out there whoever is watching
02:09 - i actually uh would love it if you would
02:12 - join us yes that's right so students are
02:14 - like looking at each other
02:16 - [Laughter]
02:18 - like whoa i wasn't expecting this but
02:20 - yes this morning you're going to learn
02:22 - how to do a little salsa dancing so yes
02:24 - you can you move get out of your desk
02:27 - yeah i'm already standing okay that's
02:29 - okay kids i know you're looking at each
02:31 - other you look at the teacher teachers
02:33 - please allow them to do it go ahead and
02:35 - stand up and uh
02:37 - okay pat
02:38 - i i just i just grabbed some
02:40 - some sauce of music
02:42 - let's see
02:44 - let's see how this goes
03:00 - the secret with the timing is it's one
03:02 - two three pause on four five six seven
03:05 - so we're gonna start with your right leg
03:07 - i'm gonna set my right leg out you can't
03:09 - see it as much and then you're gonna go
03:11 - to your left leg
03:12 - so think one two three
03:15 - five six seven and then
03:17 - it's easier to see my arms but your arms
03:19 - almost do a little bit of a figure eight
03:21 - all right one smooth okay one yeah
03:24 - three pause
03:27 - five six seven okay
03:29 - and then you finish it off with a turn
03:31 - five six seven do you step forward
03:33 - and then
03:35 - turn
03:36 - one two three pause
03:39 - five six seven
03:42 - you got it and then the finale with the
03:44 - turn yeah you did it
03:46 - nice
03:49 - we got to give pat a round of applause
03:51 - for that look at that two of them great
03:55 - i'm here all week
03:57 - wow so
03:58 - um so amazon uh
04:02 - world war head of worldwide solutions
04:04 - architects at amazon as well as
04:06 - professional salsa dancer now the break
04:08 - dancing now i'm not gonna even go there
04:11 - so everyone's
04:12 - kids are probably really interested in
04:13 - that as well but we don't have the uh
04:15 - probably the space for them
04:18 - the space
04:19 - [Laughter]
04:20 - right
04:21 - so well i think thanks for uh letting us
04:24 - know a little bit about your role and
04:26 - also what you do outside of work
04:28 - you know i'm curious what role does
04:30 - computer science play
04:32 - in your career and if you could also
04:34 - give us an example of
04:36 - a project a recent project that you all
04:38 - have worked on that involves computer
04:41 - yeah science
04:41 - think i think it's really interesting um
04:43 - so i studied computer science when i
04:45 - went into college and i i think you know
04:48 - i started programming actually in the
04:49 - fourth grade um and
04:52 - even today what's really interesting is
04:54 - you know computer science leaves you
04:56 - with a lot of great theories
04:58 - and those theories exist you know they
05:00 - last today as they will 20 years from
05:03 - now 30 years from now so when you learn
05:05 - things like for loops and if statements
05:07 - and while loops like what you're really
05:09 - learning is
05:10 - what are things that are repetitive what
05:12 - might require you to take a different
05:15 - condition or action based on input you
05:17 - have
05:18 - so i find that programming has helped me
05:20 - not only make better decisions with the
05:23 - architectures that i design or my team
05:25 - designs but also how we think about like
05:27 - the the way to get to success
05:30 - um i'll share my screen again but a
05:32 - really good example of that is you know
05:34 - my last really cool project i worked on
05:37 - um
05:38 - amazon has like the like wind farms that
05:41 - they're like a large energy movement on
05:43 - sustainability
05:44 - and we actually worked with the
05:47 - amazon you know wind energy team to
05:50 - basically say how do we optimize you
05:52 - know the wind farms how do we look at an
05:54 - individual wind turbine
05:56 - understand speed velocity rotation
05:59 - braking that happens that's required to
06:01 - make sure that you can kind of capture
06:03 - the most
06:04 - capture energy efficiently and all of
06:07 - this is run by the same kind of concepts
06:09 - you know if you have a certain type of
06:11 - weather condition then you do this
06:14 - if you have really great weather and low
06:15 - winds then you do something else so all
06:18 - that programming still comes into play
06:20 - today
06:21 - wow
06:22 - that's um
06:23 - it's really cool i didn't i didn't even
06:25 - know that amazon was into wind farming
06:27 - like that um
06:32 - can you um tell us you know
06:35 - you're you're again you're the head uh
06:37 - head of
06:39 - this head of worldwide solutions
06:41 - architects at amazon uh when it comes to
06:43 - the internet of things uh can you tell
06:45 - us what the internet of things actually
06:47 - is
06:48 - yeah
06:49 - it's really interesting
06:51 - you know like we
06:52 - i if you told me i was going to be a
06:54 - solution architect in iot you know when
06:56 - i was in you know middle school high
06:58 - school like i don't know what any of
06:59 - those things are
07:02 - they didn't really exist in the same way
07:04 - they do today but think about the
07:05 - internet of things as you know smart
07:07 - home if you have a smart thermostat even
07:10 - if you're into gaming you know a lot of
07:12 - gaming consoles if you want to get the
07:13 - latest game update these are devices
07:16 - that are connected to the internet
07:18 - and then solution architects like what
07:19 - my team does is i have a team of 40
07:22 - people around the world and they help
07:23 - customers connect these type of devices
07:26 - to the internet
07:27 - so think of customers like if you've got
07:29 - a vizio tv
07:30 - they're a big customer of ours you can
07:33 - kind of catch them on youtube talking
07:34 - about how it's easy to connect tvs and
07:37 - you know help people get a better
07:39 - viewing experience so we work with
07:41 - customers around that to kind of solve
07:43 - the the things part of the internet of
07:46 - things wow so okay so there's um
07:49 - lg with their refrigerator right yeah
07:52 - uh
07:54 - um and then all of i mean i guess you uh
07:57 - all the echo devices are things that
08:00 - connected to the internet correct yeah
08:02 - exactly yeah and you think like if
08:04 - you've got a roomba in your house and
08:05 - it's kind of cleaning that's a thing um
08:08 - and then you can even look at things
08:09 - like how do you get a package to your
08:11 - door you know when someone's routing a
08:13 - delivery package they normally have a
08:15 - tablet in their hand and that's also a
08:17 - thing to help them figure out
08:19 - where is the most optimal route to help
08:21 - deliver your amazon package so it lots
08:23 - of things are connected which is which
08:25 - is a fun space to be in yeah and they're
08:27 - all and they can also talk to one
08:29 - another they're not just um it's not
08:31 - just one way to some
08:34 - to
08:34 - some computer somewhere or to yeah they
08:37 - can they can communicate with one
08:38 - another
08:39 - and coordinate i guess right
08:41 - yeah exactly yeah it's very it's very
08:43 - funny i've i've done it throughout my
08:44 - entire house but it's great i can kind
08:46 - of you know when it's time for bedtime i
08:48 - could just say like
08:49 - you know echo alexa it's time for bed
08:52 - and the lights go off i've got a smart
08:54 - lock the smart lock locks and it's just
08:56 - you know it's all automated so that's
08:58 - the fun part um for sure
09:00 - wow so you you already mentioned how
09:03 - you've been you never thought that you'd
09:05 - be into the internet of things the
09:06 - internet things that didn't even really
09:08 - exist when you were in high school can
09:10 - you tell us a little bit about how you
09:12 - got to where you are today
09:14 - and who were the people who helped you
09:16 - along the way
09:18 - yeah pat that's a really cool question
09:20 - um
09:21 - i i
09:22 - i'll start with how i got to where i am
09:24 - today um and i'll say i think the fun
09:27 - thing for me is that i
09:28 - i if you notice in my name i'm nigerian
09:31 - um so you know when my parents kind of
09:34 - came here to the states it was just it
09:37 - was just assumed that i was either going
09:38 - to be a doctor or a lawyer like that's
09:40 - what you just like nigerians like you're
09:41 - going to be a doctor you're going to be
09:42 - a lawyer um my my father was a doctor uh
09:46 - but i i can't handle i can't handle
09:49 - blood or anything like i have a very
09:50 - queasy stomach so i was like clearly i
09:52 - can't be a doctor um but i started
09:54 - falling in love with programming when i
09:56 - was really young so i started doing
09:58 - programming and then as i got a little
10:00 - bit
10:00 - older i really got into sports i grew up
10:03 - in tennessee i was a big volunteers fan
10:06 - so peyton manning was a volunteer so i
10:09 - was like really into football and i was
10:11 - also really into basketball uh and you
10:13 - can't see me but i'm only like five five
10:16 - five and i thought i was going to play
10:18 - in the nba and um my my dad kind of came
10:21 - to you know help me set reality that i
10:23 - probably wouldn't be too tall um look up
10:25 - muggsy bogues he played in the nba he's
10:28 - my height
10:29 - but i love sports um and i started
10:31 - getting into math again and i had to
10:33 - figure out how i could do both
10:35 - um so i went to school and i studied
10:36 - computer science but then i also started
10:38 - doing things to just keep my
10:41 - athletic passion going like dance
10:44 - and i've kind of used both of those
10:45 - skill sets to
10:47 - be in a position where as a solution
10:49 - architect you don't just do a lot of
10:51 - coding
10:52 - you also help like explain these
10:54 - concepts it's kind of like you're you're
10:56 - an artist in a sense you're trying to
10:58 - help people understand and articulate
11:00 - strategy and you've got to engage them
11:02 - in the right way so that's kind of how
11:04 - i've gotten to where i am today um
11:07 - i think there's been a lot of people who
11:08 - have helped me there
11:10 - two people that really stand out
11:13 - one was my professor in college like he
11:15 - was a great mentor to me uh his name is
11:18 - uh brian kerningham and i i did bring a
11:21 - picture of him as well but if the name
11:24 - sounds kind of familiar uh brian
11:26 - kerningham actually wrote the first
11:28 - programming book
11:30 - so if you go back into the archives a
11:32 - long time ago and say what was one of
11:33 - the first programming books i've ever
11:34 - written it was by brian kerningham on
11:37 - the c language
11:39 - and he really taught me how to think
11:41 - differently and how to apply those
11:43 - programming concepts kind of out into
11:45 - the real world so he's definitely one of
11:48 - the people who stand out sent out to me
11:50 - uh the most
11:51 - wow
11:52 - and who's the other the second
11:55 - yeah
11:57 - funny enough i'd actually say i really
11:59 - like to have people kind of as i start
12:01 - out and then as i get a little bit a
12:03 - little bit older i will give a plug to
12:05 - my third grade teacher i was i was
12:06 - thinking about this a little bit uh mrs
12:09 - bond uh and what was funny is i i didn't
12:11 - start programming until i was in the
12:12 - fourth grade
12:13 - but mrs bond was like you know you you
12:15 - should really you have a very like
12:17 - analytical thinking like i was really
12:19 - good at math at the time and she's like
12:21 - you should do this thing called
12:23 - computers like it's kind of new we don't
12:25 - have that many like you should go do it
12:27 - and so she was definitely one of my
12:29 - inspirations in starting like my
12:32 - curiosity at a young age um and then i i
12:35 - brought one other person uh who's been
12:37 - my mentor more recently
12:39 - and it's this gentleman in the middle um
12:42 - this is a podcast show we're doing here
12:45 - at work
12:46 - but the person in the middle is actually
12:49 - james gosling um and if you don't know
12:52 - who james gosling is he wrote java
12:56 - so if you know the java programming
12:57 - language it runs on everything it runs
12:59 - on your androids
13:00 - uh tablets and things like that he is
13:02 - the inventor of it so he's actually been
13:04 - a more recent uh mentor for me and it's
13:07 - been it's been great to pick his brain
13:08 - about you know being any internet and
13:11 - being in programming when
13:14 - you know there was only 10 or 15 people
13:16 - doing it
13:16 - [Laughter]
13:17 - wow wow yeah you're very fortunate um
13:20 - you know i wanted to remind our
13:22 - participants that they actually can ask
13:25 - questions by using the the q a feature
13:28 - so please feel free folks out there to
13:31 - ask your students if they have any
13:32 - questions and then type them into the q
13:34 - a and we'll try to
13:36 - address them as we go here
13:38 - um
13:40 - so
13:41 - uh
13:42 - what
13:44 - what while i you talked about people
13:46 - helping you along the way and how you
13:48 - got to where you are today
13:50 - what obstacles have you faced along the
13:53 - way and and how you dealt with those
13:55 - obstacles
13:58 - yeah i think i think there's a couple
14:00 - interesting obstacles i would say
14:03 - um
14:04 - growing up i did grow up in a very small
14:06 - town so i i think you know i grew up in
14:08 - the south
14:09 - um
14:09 - one of the obstacles i had was when i
14:11 - got into college i i didn't give a name
14:14 - but i went to princeton university it's
14:16 - you know it's a prestigious school and
14:17 - there's all these famous names there
14:19 - um but one of my obstacles was like i
14:21 - didn't feel like i actually fit in in
14:23 - that world like i was like wow i'm
14:25 - surrounded by
14:26 - um there was someone in my class who was
14:28 - like the number two fence fencer like
14:31 - olympic fencer in the world and we had
14:32 - people going to the olympics for
14:34 - swimming and all these things and you
14:35 - know i sat at a computer and programmed
14:38 - and i danced um and so i always felt
14:41 - like i didn't necessarily fit in or
14:42 - maybe my skill set wasn't the right one
14:45 - and so one of the things i've had to
14:47 - consistently overcome is understanding
14:49 - that like my unique background being
14:51 - brings something to the table and i have
14:53 - to be a little bit more kind of open to
14:56 - the experience i've had and that they
14:58 - have you know value for others so that's
15:01 - something i think kind of going through
15:03 - my academic years has been a challenge
15:06 - um
15:07 - i would say more recently
15:09 - in this kind of global world i have a
15:11 - really large team and you know there's
15:13 - people in korea and people in europe and
15:15 - people in the americas
15:17 - and
15:18 - understanding that that all of them have
15:20 - a different kind of cultural experience
15:22 - and making sure that all of their voices
15:24 - are heard and all of their thinking is
15:26 - kind of brought together and so it's
15:28 - kind of come a little bit full circle
15:30 - for me in some of the challenges i face
15:32 - today
15:33 - wow that's um that's really good advice
15:35 - i i know that uh you know as adults
15:38 - you're talking about yourself at
15:39 - princeton you were an adult already and
15:41 - even now and even me now as an adult
15:44 - uh you know you sometimes look at other
15:46 - people and you think oh they're so smart
15:47 - or whatever what do i have to contribute
15:50 - and you forget that it's not about like
15:52 - just
15:53 - about being smart as much as like
15:55 - people bring different skill sets uh and
16:00 - very unique experiences to uh to a
16:02 - situation
16:05 - and you know students out there all of
16:07 - you all of you are bringing something
16:09 - unique to a situation and sometimes the
16:12 - the problem is not trying to be smart or
16:14 - be like everyone else the problem is
16:16 - trying to figure out how to use
16:19 - your unique experiences and be in a
16:21 - situation
16:23 - um where you you know you can use that
16:26 - use uh
16:27 - use those special characteristics that
16:29 - you have
16:30 - yeah we have a question actually from uh
16:33 - nicole west high
16:36 - what advice wale would you give to
16:38 - students who are just getting started in
16:40 - their first computer science class
16:44 - and what classes should we should they
16:47 - take
16:48 - or a side projects to try out
16:52 - awesome um this is a really good
16:54 - question i i um
16:57 - when you first start out in
16:59 - like computer science and programming
17:01 - most of the time you do you know like
17:03 - what i call the happy path like
17:05 - everything works you you copy and paste
17:08 - everything exactly right you compile it
17:10 - nothing happens which is normally a good
17:12 - sign and then you run it um what i found
17:15 - really helpful is i actually tell people
17:17 - you know make some mistakes on purpose
17:19 - so once you have the perfect you know
17:21 - program and you've written your you know
17:23 - your function or your object correctly
17:25 - go in and do things incorrectly because
17:28 - what it's going to help you understand
17:30 - is like what happens when things don't
17:32 - go as planned um when you get into like
17:36 - you know the internet i work in amazon
17:38 - web services so the cloud like all these
17:40 - data centers and things like that
17:42 - our motto is everything fails all the
17:44 - time so if you start taking your
17:46 - programs and understand okay what
17:47 - happens when this thing fails what
17:49 - message do i get
17:50 - you actually get a lot more experience
17:53 - with the same thing you've been writing
17:55 - um and i i think for side projects as
17:57 - well you should do something you're
17:59 - passionate about like you want a side
18:01 - project that challenges you but you're
18:03 - also really interested in
18:05 - my first side project in the fourth
18:07 - grade i was very much into snoopy uh so
18:09 - the character stupi so i did a lot of
18:12 - like graphic animations of snoopy i'd
18:14 - have him like walk around and like get
18:15 - on top of his his doghouse and like so
18:18 - but it was fun for me like i loved
18:20 - seeing the output of what i was doing so
18:23 - find something you're passionate about
18:24 - and then it'll also kind of lead you to
18:27 - additional
18:28 - learnings
18:29 - yeah i would add that oftentimes
18:32 - teachers are assigning projects
18:34 - and you in students you're completing
18:36 - these projects uh probably just fine or
18:38 - you know or maybe you know not so fine
18:41 - either way
18:42 - it's an opportunity for you to kind of
18:44 - personalize what what that project is so
18:48 - while a maybe a teacher had a sign for
18:50 - you all to um
18:52 - i don't know just create some art or
18:54 - create uh do a particular animation or
18:57 - something like that and you decided to
18:58 - personalize it by animating snoopy in
19:01 - the same way
19:02 - kids um
19:04 - you know if
19:05 - if you're doing some kind of like math
19:07 - operator calculation boolean logic
19:11 - project
19:12 - uh there's no reason that potentially
19:14 - you could turn it into
19:16 - um
19:17 - something that i always think about like
19:20 - something to do with uh like
19:22 - like shoot like shoes or clothes i'm not
19:25 - saying i think about shoes or clothes
19:26 - [Laughter]
19:29 - uh whenever i think about those projects
19:30 - i think of like oh what how can i turn
19:32 - that project into something that might
19:34 - help me pick clothes or make my life
19:37 - easier you know like a clothes and shoe
19:39 - matcher something like that who knows
19:42 - you know we have another question from
19:44 - adam do you have any advice for our
19:46 - class we're a grade 11 computer
19:48 - programming class and working on working
19:50 - on our final project using construct.net
19:54 - so i don't know if you're familiar with
19:56 - that you can here we can uh go ahead and
19:59 - i'm gonna open it up in a tab
20:01 - yeah i think it's um i wanna say it's
20:04 - funny i work with our gaming team every
20:05 - so often i want to say like
20:08 - if i recall correctly it's in gaming um
20:12 - i remember a little bit as well like i
20:14 - think
20:18 - this is one of the interesting parts
20:19 - because
20:20 - like you you you won't know all
20:22 - languages you run into so when we go
20:24 - back to computer science it's grounding
20:26 - yourself in the fundamentals like i was
20:28 - mentioning earlier
20:29 - um
20:30 - and so for things like construct if i
20:33 - remember correctly they're kind of
20:34 - browser-based job like javascript type
20:37 - applications
20:38 - so like some of the things i look at not
20:40 - knowing your final project but what
20:42 - would be really interesting is you know
20:44 - javascript has a lot of when i talk
20:47 - about kind of things that um you can
20:49 - experiment with javascript does things
20:51 - like you can run things parallel you can
20:53 - run things serially
20:55 - you can do things like um you know set
20:58 - an event and then catch an event
21:00 - and so as you think about the gaming
21:02 - experience like think about interesting
21:04 - things you can do
21:05 - in that kind of event loop in in
21:07 - javascript so say like well you know
21:09 - what i was doing before is playing sound
21:11 - but what if i decided to in that event
21:13 - not just play sound but also make you
21:16 - know changes to the score on the fly
21:18 - now we kind of call this like dynamic um
21:22 - like dynamic behaviors like that's a
21:24 - really kind of cool concept in gaming
21:26 - like it learns and adapts to your style
21:29 - you can do it in a really simple way
21:31 - today which is just like take these
21:32 - interesting events
21:34 - and do something random with them so
21:36 - maybe instead of just saying well i'm
21:38 - going to give you
21:39 - points in the sound i want to give you
21:41 - you know additional points because it's
21:43 - five o'clock
21:44 - i mean you're doing it right at the end
21:45 - of your day
21:46 - and that just allows you to experiment a
21:48 - little bit as well um javascript's an
21:50 - interesting language i actually ran it
21:52 - at a like a company like a startup with
21:55 - me and my friend
21:56 - um debugging javascript has always been
22:00 - is always been one of the things i
22:01 - struggled with so
22:02 - events have helped me try to
22:05 - you know rationalize what's happening as
22:07 - well okay thanks thanks wale um we have
22:10 - a question about internet of things
22:11 - which actually i had a question as well
22:14 - um
22:15 - you know because uh as a teacher the
22:17 - internet of things um i last taught in
22:19 - like 2013 it started really becoming a
22:22 - thing
22:23 - and i was always curious how could
22:27 - uh
22:28 - how could i get my students exposed to
22:32 - uh that type of programming you know
22:35 - like so like like right now there there
22:37 - are teachers listening to us like while
22:39 - they like how do they i mean
22:41 - with our echo devices can we just go
22:43 - ahead and start coding for them like
22:46 - like how do we how do we get uh
22:48 - beginners involved in the internet of
22:50 - things
22:51 - yeah uh that's that's a really good
22:53 - question too like i um i think there's a
22:55 - couple things you can program your
22:56 - echoes you probably you probably
22:58 - shouldn't they actually take a lot of
22:59 - work like you have to get into the the
23:01 - details of them a bit but what's really
23:04 - interesting is um and maybe pat i can
23:07 - find a way to share this or people can
23:09 - search for it
23:10 - um there's two things um there's this
23:13 - there's this platform called raspberry
23:15 - raspberry pi they're they're great to
23:17 - use like they're very very simple
23:20 - um
23:21 - the other thing that we have amazon
23:22 - actually launched just recently it's
23:24 - called the educate so it's a it's um
23:27 - [Music]
23:28 - it's like an mcu a microcontroller so
23:30 - very very small form factor i
23:34 - oh here we go
23:36 - i was like i think i have a test one on
23:37 - my desk so they're very very small form
23:40 - factor and you can actually like order
23:42 - these off of amazon and they teach you
23:44 - the basics of hardware so you'll
23:47 - understand what does a serial port mean
23:49 - to communicate to another
23:51 - um you know part of the device how do
23:53 - you actually do a hello world
23:55 - on a piece of hardware so this is one
23:57 - thing educate's really great um
23:59 - raspberry pi's and most of these have
24:01 - like very simple getting started as well
24:04 - so
24:05 - i'd recommend either one of those to um
24:07 - start learning if you go the educate
24:10 - route 2 there's a whole video series so
24:12 - i'll be happy to find a way to kind of
24:14 - share it with the group uh afterwards
24:16 - okay thanks wale um
24:19 - next question uh
24:21 - you mentioned the importance of making
24:23 - mistakes can you share one mistake you
24:24 - made at your job and what you learned
24:26 - from them
24:28 - oh
24:29 - i make a lot of mistakes
24:33 - um
24:34 - that's a really good question
24:36 - um
24:38 - you know i'll actually talk about
24:40 - uh maybe the mistake i made with
24:44 - i can't name the the customer name but
24:46 - we were doing a we're basically doing a
24:48 - deployment for a customer basically like
24:52 - this is last year but you can think if
24:53 - you're in the kind of holiday season
24:56 - there's lots of customers who need to
24:58 - get products out the door for holidays
25:00 - right you know the the christmas time
25:02 - the right after thanksgiving
25:04 - um and i was actually working with a
25:06 - customer where they were doing millions
25:09 - of devices that they're going to take
25:10 - for holidays
25:12 - and normally when you do millions of
25:14 - devices you you want to have them test
25:17 - above and beyond what they're going to
25:18 - bring um but based on timing we only had
25:22 - like a month and we really needed two to
25:23 - three months to do this work
25:25 - and so i kind of made a decision like
25:27 - let's just test capacity
25:29 - like as close that we can get to for
25:31 - your holidays um so we didn't do what i
25:34 - normally recommend we kind of do a bit
25:35 - of smaller one
25:36 - um unfortunately we basically launched
25:39 - on black friday and they were underwater
25:41 - they were basically
25:43 - like instead of being able to handle
25:44 - everything they could only handle about
25:46 - like two-thirds of what they normally
25:48 - could um and this was clearly my mistake
25:50 - i would have told them to delay things
25:52 - or try to escalate and have them add
25:54 - more capacity um so it ended up costing
25:58 - us about two weeks of work afterwards so
26:00 - as soon as this failed we had to
26:02 - basically spend time
26:03 - helping them scale up correctly do a
26:05 - bunch of remediations catching errors
26:08 - around not handling capacity
26:10 - things we could have done earlier but we
26:12 - waited for um
26:14 - that's probably my most recent mistake i
26:16 - find
26:17 - even in those cases like
26:19 - that mistake happened and everyone ended
26:21 - up being okay it cost us a few weeks of
26:23 - time but we're able to still help a
26:26 - customer um
26:28 - so yeah that's probably my most recent
26:29 - one um it's a lot of late nights um in
26:33 - coffee which is not what i normally like
26:34 - to
26:37 - we're do of at the end here i know it
26:39 - went fast uh i i wanted to make sure
26:41 - that you had an opportunity to speak
26:43 - directly to the students
26:45 - um like what do you want them to
26:47 - remember or take away
26:49 - uh
26:50 - from from this class chat and from your
26:52 - experience
26:55 - yeah i mean first off thank you so much
26:57 - like it's uh it's a pleasure just to be
26:59 - in front of everyone and to share my
27:01 - experience um
27:03 - i'd probably say there's there's like
27:04 - maybe one thing that's top of mind for
27:06 - me for people to take away and i kind of
27:08 - talked about my experience of background
27:10 - a little bit
27:11 - um but i i have this like bruce lee
27:14 - quote that sits at my desk um which
27:17 - which basically talks about like you
27:19 - know
27:20 - absorb what is useful
27:22 - discard what is not and then make it
27:24 - uniquely your own and i think the thing
27:27 - that stuck with me the most is making
27:28 - things uniquely my own so you're going
27:30 - to learn a lot of skills you're going to
27:32 - develop your technical capabilities
27:34 - you're going to program more and more
27:36 - but making it your own is what's really
27:38 - important and so always bringing
27:40 - yourself you know into the work that
27:42 - you're doing and into the classes that
27:44 - you're in
27:45 - and i'd also say the other thing i bring
27:48 - there is you know make sure you're
27:49 - working with your your classmates too
27:51 - like
27:52 - i you know it's very easy to kind of
27:54 - work by yourself and do homework by
27:56 - yourself and code and program but the
27:58 - things i've learned the most have been
28:00 - through the people that i've worked with
28:02 - you know in college i had colleagues
28:03 - like peers i worked with really closely
28:05 - in high school i did as well
28:07 - and they just make you a better kind of
28:10 - programmer and developer and a better
28:12 - better person so i hope i leave those
28:14 - two things with you and it's just been
28:16 - an honor and appreciate the time
28:18 - thank you thank you and uh everyone else
28:21 - thank you for joining us uh on code.org
28:25 - cs journeys class chats
28:28 - that was uh wales
28:31 - head of worldwide solutions architects
28:32 - internet of things at amazon
28:35 - thank you for joining us um please visit
28:38 - uh cs journeys
28:41 - and for any more information and to sign
28:43 - up for future class chats thank you
