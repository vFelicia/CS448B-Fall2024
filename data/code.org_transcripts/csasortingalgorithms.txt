00:10 - there are many ways we can sort a list
00:12 - of data
00:13 - software engineers often use a selection
00:15 - sort an insertion sort for a merge sort
00:19 - the selection sort is a sorting
00:21 - algorithm that selects the smallest
00:23 - element from an unsorted array in each
00:26 - iteration and places that element at the
00:28 - beginning of the unsorted array
00:30 - the list is divided into two parts
00:33 - the sorted part of the list is at the
00:34 - front end and the unsorted part is at
00:36 - the back end
00:37 - the selection sort algorithm searches
00:39 - for the smallest value in the uncertain
00:41 - part of the list it then moves it to the
00:43 - correct position in the sorted part
00:48 - [Music]
00:52 - the insertion sort is a sorting
00:53 - algorithm that shifts each item in a
00:56 - list one at a time to the correct
00:58 - position in the sorted portion of that
01:00 - list
01:01 - an insertion sort starts by comparing
01:03 - the first two elements it will check if
01:06 - the second element is smaller than the
01:07 - first
01:08 - if so it will move it in the front of
01:10 - the list
01:11 - this process continues until the element
01:13 - is placed at the correct location
01:18 - [Music]
01:20 - the merge sort is a divide and conquer
01:22 - sorting algorithm that repeatedly breaks
01:24 - down a list into sublist until each
01:26 - sublist consists of a single element
01:28 - emerges those sorted sublist until it
01:31 - results into a sorted list
01:34 - merchant starts by splitting the list in
01:36 - half
01:37 - if the resulting list contains more than
01:39 - one item then those are split in half as
01:41 - well
01:42 - this continues until each list contains
01:44 - only one item
01:47 - now we can combine this list back into
01:49 - one
01:50 - we compare the elements in each list to
01:51 - combine them into sorted list with two
01:53 - elements
01:55 - this continues until we have one list
01:57 - with all the elements in order
02:01 - sorting is an important component of
02:02 - many programs and can often become
02:04 - pretty complex as the size of our list
02:06 - increases these sorting algorithms are
02:09 - commonly used by software engineers to
02:11 - help organize data in our programs
