00:03 - Advice I would give teachers who are teaching
this course for the first time, is one: look
00:10 - over the curriculum, take a look at the different
units, go through the activities, through
00:17 - the lesson plans, check out all of the resources
created for you.
00:21 - There are Powerpoints, lesson plans, guiding
questions.
00:25 - And if you already know a lot about computer
science, you can take those lesson plans and
00:32 - modify them for the way that you teach.
00:34 - I think the major thing that comes up when
talking to different teachers, is this fear
00:40 - of being vulnerable in front of our students,
because we're used to needing to have all
00:47 - the answers and knowing everything, and them
looking to us to give them all the answers.
00:54 - I think it's very important in computer science
classes that we encourage them to try to find
01:01 - those answers themselves.
01:03 - Take a risk.
01:04 - Be willing to make mistakes in front of your
students.
01:06 - It will do wonders for your classroom culture
as you build that.
01:11 - And secondly, use the resources provided.
01:14 - There's no need to reinvent the wheel.
01:17 - The resources are there for you.
01:20 - It's definitely scary letting go of being
the person who knows everything, to be the
01:25 - person who's facilitating the ideas and then
problem solving with the students on how to
01:31 - solve those ideas.
01:32 - It's exciting, it's fun, as students start
to realize "We're all in this together".
01:40 - It becomes less of me telling them what to
do, and more of us trying to figure out how
01:45 - to solve a problem.
01:47 - Students will always know more than you.
01:50 - Provide a space where they can learn and support
them in what their projects are.
01:55 - At first, it's nerve-wracking, it's scary,
but then you get that excitement back when
02:00 - you first started teaching.
02:02 - If you can stay one step ahead of your students,
you'll be golden.
