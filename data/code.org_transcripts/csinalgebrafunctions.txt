00:07 - Imagine if every time you wanted someone to
make a sandwich, but they had no understanding
00:11 - of what make a sandwich means, you'd have
to describe every last step of sandwich-making.
00:17 - >From opening the fridge to slicing the bread,
to layering the ingredients to spreading the
00:23 - condiments.
00:24 - If you ever needed someone to make a sandwich
more than once, you'd want to agree on a common
00:28 - shorthand for make a sandwich.
00:30 - And you'd probably want make a sandwich to
be generic enough to allow someone to make
00:34 - a ham and swiss or peanut butter and jelly
or tuna and sprouts.
00:41 - Make a sandwich becomes a new function that
can take in certain inputs such as filling,
00:46 - condiments and bread and performs a set of
operations on them.
00:50 - Spreading the condiments on bread, layering
the filling between the two slices and returns
00:54 - an object of type: sandwich.
00:57 - Remember our fifty red triangles from the
last stage?
01:00 - What if we didn't want fifty of the exact
same shape but fifty red polygons, each one
01:04 - with one more side than the last.
01:06 - First triangle, then square, a pentagon, a
hexagon and so on.
01:12 - We can do just that by defining a new function
that doesn't return the same shape every time.
01:17 - Let's call our new function My Polygon.
01:20 - It should take a single number for sides and
return a red polygon of given sides.
01:25 - We can call this function with every number
from three to fifty-three to fill up our screen
01:30 - with red polygons.
01:31 - At the beginning of this course we talked
about math as a kind of language.
01:35 - When we define variables, we are essentially
adding new things or nouns to our language.
01:40 - When we define functions, we expand our language
with new actions or verbs.
01:46 - In this next stage, you're going to edit and
write simple functions to output a variety
01:50 - of images.
01:51 - To get inside a function, you click the word
edit in the corner of the function's block.
01:56 - >From there, you can complete the contract
for your new function, including a name, domain
02:01 - and range.
02:02 - There's also a section for you to write a
description of what your function should do.
02:09 - Underneath the function contract is an area
for you to build your function definition.
02:14 - Make sure to use the parameter blocks that
were generated when you filled out the domain.
02:18 - When you call your function, the values that
you passed as inputs end up in these placeholders.
