00:04 - Hi! My name is Jess. I'm a member of the

a short tour of the Code.org website.  
00:14 - Once you are signed into your teacher 
account, you will be brought to your  
00:19 - teacher homepage. This is where you will go 
to view and manage your classroom sections,  
00:26 - access courses that you have already made 
progress on, and find additional resources.
00:34 - After you create classroom sections, 
all of your sections will show up  
00:38 - in the classroom sections area of your home

00:44 - your courses, you will be able to track that 
progress, using your teacher dashboard.

name of the section that you would like to view.

progress, either by the individual lesson, or  
01:03 - by levels within a lesson. You will 
also be able to view text responses,

specific to the unit you are teaching.  
02:33 - You have printing options, and 
the ability to view and modify  
02:38 - a unit calendar based on the number of 
minutes you meet with your students per week.

description of each lesson within the unit.

02:55 - and manage whether or not your students are able 
to see the content, by using the Visible and Hidden buttons.
