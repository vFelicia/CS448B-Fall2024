00:04 - hi I'm NAT I was one of the original
00:07 - designers of the Xbox I've been working
00:10 - with computers since I was maybe seven
00:11 - years old and now I work on virtual
00:14 - reality
00:25 - computers are everywhere there it keeps
00:28 - pockets there in people's cars or have
00:31 - them on their wrists they might be in
00:33 - your backpack right now but what makes a
00:37 - computer a computer what does make a
00:39 - computer a computer anyway and how does
00:41 - it even work
00:46 - as humans we've always built tools to
00:49 - help us solve problems tools like a
00:50 - wheelbarrow
00:51 - a hammer or a printing press or a
00:53 - tractor trailer all of these inventions
00:56 - helped us with manual work over time
00:59 - people began to wonder if a machine
01:02 - could be designed and built to help us
01:03 - with the thinking work we do like
01:06 - solving equations or tracking the stars
01:08 - in the sky rather than moving or
01:10 - manipulating physical things like dirt
01:12 - and stone these machines would need to
01:15 - be designed to manipulate information
01:17 - [Applause]

01:20 - the earliest computers were made out of
01:23 - wood and metal with mechanical levers
01:25 - and gears by the 20th century though
01:28 - computers started using electrical
01:30 - components these early computers were
01:32 - really large and really slow a computer
01:35 - the size of a room might take hours just
01:37 - to do a basic math problem
01:40 - these machines are things of gleaming
01:42 - very colored metal and numerous flashing
01:45 - lights computers started out as basic
01:48 - calculators which was already really
01:50 - awesome at the time and they were only
01:52 - manipulating numbers back then but now
01:55 - we can use them to talk to each other we
01:57 - can use them to play games control
01:59 - robots and do any crazy thing that you
02:02 - could probably imagine the computers we
02:04 - use today look really different from the
02:06 - earliest thinking machines and who knows
02:09 - what the computers of tomorrow will be
02:10 - like my hope is that you get to help
02:12 - decide what you want the computers of
02:14 - tomorrow to look like
02:16 - [Music]
