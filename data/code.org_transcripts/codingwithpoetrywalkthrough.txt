00:03 - welcome to computer science connections
00:05 - coding with poetry this module makes
00:08 - connections between Ela and computer
00:10 - science specifically it can introduce
00:13 - reinforce or extend any student learning
00:15 - related to poem writing if you're
00:18 - teaching about imagery mood and tone or
00:21 - just want to get your students coding
00:23 - you've come to the right
00:27 - place in this module students will use
00:30 - Sprite lab to bring a poem to Life by
00:33 - illustrating a shift in mood and
00:35 - animating images that appear on screen
00:39 - students will code their own original
00:42 - poem by adding backgrounds effects
00:45 - sounds and
00:47 - Sprites the main computer science
00:49 - Concepts in this module are events in
00:52 - coding there are CA and effect
00:54 - relationships we trigger with events an
00:57 - event is an action that tells a specific
00:59 - chunk of code to run events allow us to
01:03 - change our programs in real time for
01:06 - example by assigning a spin right
01:08 - Behavior with a mouse click event we can
01:11 - command this hamburger to spin to the
01:14 - right when it's
01:18 - clicked there are four lessons in this
01:20 - module in lesson one students will
01:22 - animate a poem by using code to
01:25 - illustrate the
01:28 - mood
01:31 - lesson two is an unplugged lesson in
01:33 - which students will plan and write their
01:35 - own poem based on their life and
01:38 - personal
01:43 - experiences in lesson three students
01:45 - will enter their own poem into the play
01:47 - space and then use code to add
01:49 - backgrounds effects sounds and
01:58 - Sprites
02:00 - in the final unplugged lesson students
02:03 - will share their poem apps with a
02:05 - partner and participate in a poetry
02:11 - Circle often students try to snap a
02:14 - green event block under the win run
02:16 - block but this won't work the event
02:19 - block stands on its own and any code
02:21 - added to it will run when the event is
02:24 - triggered encourage students to
02:26 - frequently test their code they will
02:28 - need to press run then use the play
02:31 - Space to trigger the
02:36 - event a student might encounter a bug if
02:39 - their Sprite costume selections are
02:41 - inconsistent have students double check
02:44 - that they've selected the correct
02:46 - costume to call the intended Sprite in
02:49 - this example the coder wants the wave
02:51 - Sprite to increase in size when line for
02:54 - shows however the coder mistakenly
02:57 - assigned the dog Sprite to increase in
03:00 - size because there is no dog in the play
03:02 - Space nothing will happen to debug
03:05 - change the dog Sprite costume to the
03:08 - wave Sprite costume in the event
03:17 - block if students struggle to enter
03:19 - their own poem model how to use the
03:21 - drop- down menu above the play Space to
03:24 - select enter my own enter the poem title
03:27 - author name and poem text
03:33 - in every lesson plan discussion
03:35 - questions are coupled with discussion
03:37 - goals check for understanding and
03:39 - promote student Reflection by
03:41 - incorporating these discussion questions
03:43 - into your
03:47 - teaching this module is aligned to
03:50 - Common Core Ela standards and the
03:52 - computer science Teachers Association
03:54 - standards in order to align to the
03:56 - concepts you already teach to help you
03:59 - you think of ways to integrate ask
04:01 - yourself how might this module support
04:03 - the content I am already teaching and
04:07 - should I use this module to introduce
04:09 - reinforce or extend student learning on
04:12 - this
04:16 - topic review the concepts of poetry and
04:19 - introduce vocabulary like line mood and
04:23 - poem with your students use the provided
04:27 - slideshow to introduce these Concepts
04:29 - and test the vocabulary within the
04:31 - context of the
04:37 - lesson don't forget about the hide and
04:39 - show feature for each lesson it's best
04:42 - practice to only show the lessons
04:44 - students are currently working on if you
04:46 - do not hide the following lessons
04:48 - students will move to the next lesson
04:54 - automatically before teaching the module
04:56 - complete each coding level on your own
04:59 - you can write and code your own poem as
05:02 - an example for students make sure to
05:05 - review the lesson plans and additional
05:07 - resources code.org provides resources
05:10 - like slides student handouts and helpful
05:13 - hints to help you and your students get
