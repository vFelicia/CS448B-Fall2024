00:01 - One thing that's great about computer
science is
00:03 - it's a greatly equalizing field.
00:05 - You can sit and build something I
can sit and build something and people
00:08 - can judge us based on what we've built.
00:11 - In almost every aspect of human experience software is becoming
00:15 - more part of the DNA, more part of the genetics
00:19 - of how the product works or how the service works
00:21 - and that's reason why it's very important for everyone to have experience with software.
00:25 - When you have a diverse set of engineers in the room
00:28 - building hardware and software it means that that hardware and software
00:31 - ends up being way more accessible to a diverse set of customers.
00:35 - And having even a little bit of grounding in computer science
00:38 - can help you think about the
world differently.
00:40 - Whether that's algorithms or whether that's just creativity.
00:44 - Kids have to have that basic understanding of computer science
00:48 - in order to do anything and it really doesn't matter what industry you're in.
00:52 - So whether it's marketing, product design, financial analysis
00:57 - having software skills in every one of those domains...
01:00 - it'll make a big difference.
01:03 - It's not about being a
girl or being a boy
01:06 - It's about being talented. Computer science needs more talented people.
01:11 - People who are not afraid of being creative
01:14 - and making the world a better place.
01:17 - If we could just, you know support girls and
01:19 - give them that initial encouragement
01:21 - then we can start balancing the scales and
01:23 - then we won't even have to play with the equation
01:25 - because it will just be a natural flow.
01:27 - Computer science can unlock the best opportunities in the world
01:31 - no matter where you are.
01:32 - There's never been a better, more exciting time to be a computer scientist.
01:36 - Technology touches every part of our lives so if you can
change technology you can change the world.
01:45 - An estimated 20% of U.S. students
have a code.org account
01:49 - and right now 600,000 teachers use code.org.
01:54 - Today 9 million code.org students are female
01:57 - that's an incredible leap from just a
few short years ago when women and girls
02:00 - just weren't getting the support they
needed.
02:03 - When I think about what we're gonna be teaching in schools 5, 10, 15 years from now
02:08 - I definitely think that computer science is going to be as important of a skill
02:12 - as being able to do basic reading and writing.
02:16 - When people look back at what is genuinely an important national movement,
02:21 - the movement of computer science into America's mainstream education,
02:26 - They will appreciate that code.org was not only in the center
02:30 - but was absolutely at the forefront of all of this.
02:34 - Thank you for supporting code.org!
