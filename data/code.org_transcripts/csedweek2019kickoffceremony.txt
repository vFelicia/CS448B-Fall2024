01:10 - know
01:29 - is
01:44 - you may be seated
01:49 - welcome students and teachers
01:52 - any of our pueblo governors and tribal
01:55 - leaders welcome all guests to the santa
01:58 - fe indian school
01:59 - and happy computer science education
02:02 - week
02:03 - about two years ago our sfis teacher
02:06 - kate salah invited me to a code.org
02:09 - teacher training where they had a
02:10 - one-day training for administrators
02:13 - this training allowed me to see that
02:15 - there are many opportunities to bring
02:17 - computer science to our school
02:20 - since then she has offered a four credit
02:22 - and dual credit computer science course
02:25 - last year two of her students from her
02:28 - class elias trancosa and terrell toledo
02:31 - won the congressional app challenge
02:34 - if you did not know santa fe indian
02:37 - school has been a leader of computer
02:38 - science education dating back to 1985
02:42 - when we introduced our first computer
02:44 - programming course
02:46 - so it is fitting that we are the first
02:48 - high school to host this special event
02:51 - but students coding is not just a course
02:53 - you take in school or in college it is a
02:56 - way of creative thinking and problem
02:59 - solving so that you may find ways to
03:01 - improve our communities and maintain our
03:03 - languages and cultures
03:05 - so we are very excited to take to kick
03:08 - off computer science education week
03:12 - alexis um alexis will be joining us and
03:15 - she is alexis harrington harrigan excuse
03:18 - me up um she is the director of state
03:21 - government affairs at code.org she'll be

04:24 - 10th anniversary of computer science
04:26 - education week to be able to be with you
04:28 - all here today at the santa fe indian
04:29 - school as principal rosetta mentioned
04:31 - earlier there's been a legacy of
04:33 - computer science dating back many many
04:36 - years here in santa fe
04:39 - so this year it's 10 years i think this
04:41 - deserves some collapse so
04:42 - congratulations for 10 years of computer

08:25 - awesome thank you so much
08:28 - now i would like to introduce the csta
08:31 - president jake baskin to the stage
08:39 - so before jake was he jake was the
08:41 - president of csta he actually had my job
08:44 - at code.org so i took his job and now
08:46 - he's off doing wonderful things so thank
08:48 - you so much jake for being here thanks
08:50 - alexis
08:56 - wow so yeah thank you so much alexis
08:58 - it's it's really
09:00 - wonderful to be up here and thank you so
09:02 - much to sfis for hosting us and to
09:04 - everyone who traveled to be here today i
09:08 - also want to say a special thank you to
09:10 - many of the partners that helped make
09:12 - csta possible uh microsoft google and
09:16 - acm are key supporters and of course the
09:18 - csta members from around the world
09:22 - and most importantly i want to say a
09:24 - special thank you to all of the teachers
09:26 - here in the room and that are watching
09:28 - on the live stream
09:29 - you know it's pretty easy for me to get
09:31 - to travel around stand up here and talk
09:33 - about how great cs edweek is but the
09:36 - event only exists because of teachers
09:38 - all over that bring computer science
09:40 - into their classrooms because it's what
09:42 - their students are interested in and
09:44 - deserve and so
09:45 - i'd love it if every teacher in the room
09:46 - would stand up
09:51 - and let's give them a huge round of
09:52 - applause
09:58 - [Music]
10:08 - truly thank you teachers are doing the
10:11 - most important work
10:15 - so today we're here to celebrate the
10:17 - 10th anniversary of cs that week which
10:20 - was founded in 2009 it's a pretty
10:22 - incredible milestone and i i couldn't
10:24 - believe that i'd be standing up here
10:26 - when the first csi week was happening
10:29 - csi week was founded by a really
10:31 - incredible group of organizations and
10:33 - partners that knew cs education was
10:36 - important and wanted to make sure more
10:37 - students could learn computer science i
10:40 - want to give a special shout out to two
10:42 - folks that really helped lead the way
10:44 - chris stevenson who is the founding
10:46 - executive director of the computer
10:47 - science teachers association and cameron
10:49 - wilson who has done with acm
10:51 - and they focused on making sure that
10:53 - they could raise awareness among
10:54 - policymakers for cs education
10:57 - even getting congress to pass a
10:58 - resolution recognizing the first week
11:03 - and then
11:05 - someone figured out that policy is great
11:07 - and all
11:08 - but it's teachers who actually make
11:10 - things happen
11:11 - so in 2010
11:13 - chaired by deborah richardson the focus
11:15 - of csi week shifted and
11:18 - focused on bringing computer science
11:20 - into more classrooms and to support more
11:22 - students
11:23 - and this continued into 2011 with uh
11:27 - 2011 and 2012 with ruth farmer taking
11:30 - over to share the event
11:32 - in fact i still have the first email i
11:34 - got from my local csta chapter
11:36 - announcing that csi week was happening
11:38 - in 2010.
11:39 - we celebrated in my classroom in chicago
11:42 - and i tried to get the city of chicago
11:44 - to recognize the week i wasn't very
11:46 - successful but they've caught on since
11:48 - then
11:50 - then
11:52 - in 2013
11:53 - some guy made this video and
11:56 - responsibility for organizing css week
11:58 - was transition to code.org along with
12:01 - the launch of the hour of code
12:04 - has anyone in this room done an hour of
12:06 - code
12:08 - at least a few people hopefully everyone
12:10 - by the end of today
12:14 - which brings us here to today
12:18 - where i'm excited to share that starting
12:20 - with today's co-hosted event
12:22 - csta is going to be taking increasing
12:24 - ownership in csi week moving forward
12:26 - ensuring that it continues to be a
12:28 - community-centered and focused event
12:30 - that supports teachers across the
12:31 - country and around the world
12:40 - but that's not all i'm also thrilled
12:42 - that today csta gets to release our new
12:44 - standards for cs teachers
12:47 - these are standards that are designed to
12:48 - provide guidance around what effective
12:51 - equitable and rigorous cs instruction
12:53 - should look like
12:57 - excuse me and provide clarity around
12:59 - what cs teachers should know and be able
13:01 - to do in the computer science classroom
13:04 - i encourage you to check out these
13:05 - standards at csteachers.org
13:08 - teacher standards
13:10 - and i want to give a huge thank you to
13:12 - the incredible team of writers that
13:13 - spent this last year developing and
13:16 - debating to make these incredible
13:18 - guidance for teachers moving forward
13:20 - along with iste who partnered with us on
13:22 - this work
13:23 - so
13:24 - i just want to say one last time thanks
13:26 - to everyone everyone tuning in and
13:27 - everyone here in this room
13:29 - let's have one incredible css week
13:32 - [Applause]
13:42 - thank you so much jake
13:44 - so as i mentioned earlier i took jake's
13:46 - job at code.org
13:48 - i want to introduce the person next on
13:50 - the stage who knows maybe i'll be taking
13:52 - his job next our founder and ceo
13:55 - code.org please give a round of applause
13:56 - to hottie partoby thank you
14:06 - i'm so excited to be here and i want to
14:08 - say again thank you to the uh
14:10 - sfis for hosting us here and for all the
14:12 - partners who are here together with
14:14 - us this has been such an amazing run for
14:17 - me since 2013 in the launch of code.org
14:20 - and the launch of the very first hour of
14:22 - code campaign
14:23 - i want to start by thanking all the
14:25 - donors
14:26 - who have funded computer science
14:28 - education over the years especially
14:30 - microsoft amazon facebook and infosys as
14:33 - well as thank you to the cs education
14:35 - week advisory committee that every year
14:37 - helps us put on a wonderful event
14:40 - so we launched the hour of code six
14:42 - years ago
14:43 - back then code.org was just about five
14:45 - people
14:47 - it was a tiny little organization and we
14:48 - had this idea that in every school in
14:50 - the entire country or even in the world
14:53 - teachers can take just one hour out of
14:55 - their schedule to teach computer science
14:56 - to students to basically
14:58 - to take the veil of sort of secrecy and
15:01 - uh you know darkness away from this new
15:03 - field that is changing the world around
15:05 - us in the six years since the hour of
15:07 - code launched we've had
15:09 - 835 million hours of code done by
15:12 - students in every city and in every
15:14 - country on the planet it's been an
15:17 - incredible success
15:23 - the hour of code has become by far the
15:25 - largest movement in the history of world
15:27 - education but one hour is not enough we
15:29 - don't do just one hour of math or just
15:32 - one hour of english we teach these
15:34 - subjects year round and and throughout a
15:37 - student's education lifetime and so the
15:40 - hour of code really started a movement
15:41 - to teach computer science in schools and
15:44 - since 2013 another thing that's happened
15:46 - is in the united states we've had
15:49 - all 50 states including dc have changed
15:51 - policies in the last six years to take
15:54 - steps to make computer science part of
15:56 - the core curriculum part of the academic
15:58 - school day to make it an actual academic
16:01 - field recognized in the school system
16:03 - alongside subjects like math and english
16:05 - and science and history
16:07 - every single state including here in new
16:09 - mexico has taken steps to make computer
16:11 - science part of the academic school day
16:14 - so this has been an incredible success
16:16 - thank you all
16:21 - and computer science is not just a
16:23 - united states topic this is a global
16:25 - movement
16:26 - globally
16:28 - over 50 countries have taken steps to
16:30 - incorporate computer science in schools
16:32 - these are countries you might expect
16:34 - like south korea and japan or countries
16:37 - you might not expect like saudi arabia
16:39 - or argentina on every continent
16:41 - countries are basically taking steps to
16:44 - make computer science accessible to
16:45 - every student to increase diversity in
16:48 - the field to make sure everybody has
16:50 - access to opportunity and speaking of
16:52 - diversity one stat i'm especially proud
16:54 - of for the first time last year for the
16:56 - hour of code an equal number of boys and
16:59 - girls participated in the hour of code
17:02 - this is a
17:07 - historically computer science has been a
17:09 - field that has been dominated by men
17:10 - it's been roughly 80 men 20
17:13 - women but with the students that are
17:15 - doing the hour of code and also learning
17:17 - computer science as a follow-on course
17:19 - in schools we can completely flip that
17:22 - and get to a 50-50 gender balance and
17:24 - last year we did it with the hour of
17:26 - code and each year we're going to
17:27 - continue doing this
17:29 - now one hour of code is a great start
17:30 - but it's really just the first step
17:32 - towards a complete computer science
17:33 - pathway
17:34 - and computer science is today still not
17:37 - offered as a real course in the vast
17:38 - majority of schools but that's changing
17:41 - globally because teachers have led the
17:42 - way
17:43 - teachers as jake said are doing the most
17:46 - important job in the world and i want to
17:48 - have everybody again join in giving them
17:50 - a round of applause for the work they're
17:51 - doing in classrooms
17:58 - so our theme for this year's hour of
18:00 - code and computer science education week
18:02 - is about computer science for good
18:05 - computer science can be used in so many
18:07 - ways to make the world a better place
18:09 - we can use computer science and software
18:11 - and technology to detect diseases sooner
18:14 - and even one day cure them
18:16 - our future cars and trucks will be safer
18:18 - and more energy efficient
18:20 - we can develop cleaner and more
18:22 - sustainable energy sources
18:24 - we can offer our children more equitable
18:26 - and universally accessible education and
18:29 - there's really no limit to what we could
18:30 - do with computer science but our
18:32 - imaginations
18:33 - you can also make really cool snapchat
18:35 - filters
18:37 - computer science is this generation's
18:39 - super power and with great power comes
18:42 - great responsibility and therefore it's
18:44 - our responsibility as educators to not
18:47 - only teach the superpower in our schools
18:49 - but also to inspire students to use
18:51 - computer science for good which is why
18:53 - we chose the theme of cs for good for
18:55 - the hour of code
18:56 - and i expect this theme will stick
18:58 - around well beyond this year
19:00 - we have a short video to play to
19:02 - introduce the theme for this year
19:06 - the world has some big problems
19:09 - but i'm little what can i do
19:11 - even when problems seem big we can
19:13 - tackle them one step at a time our
19:15 - generation can help make a more
19:17 - prosperous equitable and sustainable
19:19 - world i'm learning to code i'm designing
19:22 - apps that solve local problems
19:24 - i'm programming robots
19:26 - i'm learning computer science to make
19:28 - change happen
19:29 - because with technology we can build
19:32 - robots to clean the world's oceans we
19:34 - can program drones to detect forest
19:36 - fires quickly we can empower young women
19:39 - with digital skills and tools
19:41 - we can program mobile apps to streamline
19:43 - farming in poor rural areas
19:45 - we can use gene sequencing to diagnose
19:47 - diseases and create personalized
19:49 - medicine to cure them i'm little but
19:51 - don't look at my size look at my
19:53 - potential i can make change happen i can
19:56 - make change happen i can make change
19:58 - happen i can make change happen
20:00 - [Music]
20:04 - thank you everybody
20:10 - thank you hottie what a great video
20:13 - every year for hour of code it seems
20:14 - like we outdo ourselves and this year is
20:16 - no exception
20:18 - there are a lot of misconceptions out
20:20 - there about what computer science is
20:21 - that it's a niche just for the
20:23 - technology field that it just belongs in
20:25 - silicon valley but that's just not true
20:27 - and our panel that i'm introducing today
20:30 - i am so proud embodies so much of what
20:32 - the cs for good theme is all about
20:35 - whether it's the work that they're doing
20:37 - in their career professions inventions
20:39 - that they're making every day the apps
20:42 - that they're using or their creativity
20:44 - i'm honored to welcome to the stage some
20:46 - amazing people who will be joining us up
20:48 - here
20:50 - so please join me in giving each of
20:52 - those these folks a round of applause

22:47 - from high school in new york city and
22:49 - also the founder of timeless timeless is
22:51 - an app that i created that uses
22:53 - artificial intelligence-based facial
22:55 - recognition technology to help to
22:57 - empower alzheimer's patients to stay
22:58 - connected with their friends and family
23:00 - i was inspired to create this app for my
23:02 - experience with my grandmother and i'm
23:04 - really passionate about using my passion
23:06 - for coding to help and benefit as many
23:08 - people around the world as possible
23:14 - good morning my name is jordan
23:16 - i'm lakota and nes purse on my mom's
23:18 - side and hopi in mojave on my dad's side
23:21 - i live in san francisco i work at
23:23 - pinterest
23:25 - previously worked at facebook we'll talk
23:26 - a little bit more about that
23:28 - what i'm really passionate about though
23:30 - is that representation matters that it's
23:32 - important that our native communities
23:34 - are represented within the tech sector
23:36 - and that we continue to try to draw a
23:38 - connection between our communities and
23:40 - our homelands and everything that's
23:42 - happening in the tech world so i hope to
23:44 - continue to talk about that a little bit
23:46 - more today
23:51 - good morning everyone i'm really
23:52 - thrilled to be here my name is tara and
23:54 - i run a technology entrepreneurship
23:57 - program called technovation which is to
23:59 - empower young people to find problems
24:01 - that they find in their communities and
24:04 - to actually create technology to solve
24:06 - those problems
24:07 - some things that i'm passionate about
24:10 - i like to build rockets and i like to
24:12 - paint and so sometimes i paint rockets
24:14 - and then i shoot them
24:20 - good morning i'm drew i'm
24:22 - i work at meow wolf i'm very passionate
24:25 - about
24:26 - looking
24:27 - not only creating things with my hands
24:29 - but also creating tools via
24:33 - programming that enabled me to create
24:35 - something that i wouldn't be able to
24:37 - otherwise because those tools don't
24:38 - exist there's a lot of opportunities for
24:40 - that i'm also very passionate about
24:44 - outreach and helping students understand
24:46 - how they can stay and live within this
24:48 - beautiful state that we live in
24:51 - and pursue careers within computer
24:53 - science for the for the good of
24:55 - everybody
24:57 - thank you
24:58 - so i'd like to start our first question
24:59 - it's going to be for emma and jordan um
25:02 - what got you into computer science what
25:04 - was kind of the hook to get you into
25:05 - computer science
25:07 - yeah so i was introduced to computer
25:09 - science when i was six years old i
25:11 - started kind of coding with scratch was
25:13 - a tool kind of a block by block
25:15 - programming tool to help kids learn how
25:17 - to code um and so i started with that
25:20 - and i progressed kind of to making
25:21 - little websites and games
25:23 - but then actually it was not until i was
25:25 - doing 10 years old that particularly in
25:26 - technovation with a classmate of mine
25:29 - and i create an app that uses a mobile
25:32 - app to help to detect concussions easier
25:35 - and so that was kind of my bridge into
25:36 - realizing that you know my passion for
25:38 - coding was something i thought was
25:40 - really fun and kind of a hobby that i
25:42 - like to do was actually something that
25:44 - could empower me as a middle school
25:46 - student i could affect change in the
25:47 - world and i could really benefit people
25:49 - that even i'd never met but i could
25:51 - still create something to help them
25:55 - i originally started in actually
25:57 - non-profit when i graduated from arizona
25:59 - state i moved back to the bay area and
26:01 - the first thing that i did was go to my
26:03 - relatives and say who can help me get a
26:05 - job
26:06 - and the first opportunities that came up
26:08 - were in non-profit so i worked for the
26:09 - native american health center in oakland
26:11 - for quite a while until
26:13 - my mom actually who is from standing
26:15 - rock uh said and was working at facebook
26:18 - at the time said you know there's a lot
26:20 - of opportunities in the tech world that
26:22 - you should explore and you should come
26:23 - over and you should look at some of
26:24 - these roles and you should interview for
26:26 - them and see what happens
26:28 - and so really the bridge for me was her
26:30 - just as an introduction that she even
26:32 - said this is possible you know you
26:34 - should you should look into this you
26:35 - should think about this
26:37 - and so i did i interviewed took a long
26:39 - time it's hard it's competitive and it's
26:41 - challenging
26:43 - but i made a move from non-profit into
26:45 - tech
26:46 - i worked at facebook for a little while
26:48 - and now i'm at pinterest
26:50 - so my journey is a little bit
26:51 - unconventional
26:53 - but it started from working from the
26:54 - community and now it leads me into tech
26:57 - awesome i love unconventional journeys
27:00 - especially as a teacher
27:02 - hearing from middle schoolers kids that
27:04 - i'm empowering in my classes today could
27:06 - be the next inventor of these apps that
27:08 - could do so much good for me people in
27:10 - the world so tara my next question for
27:12 - you is
27:13 - what are some of the problems that
27:15 - computer science can help us solve
27:17 - yeah so technovation has been running
27:19 - for
27:20 - 14 years in 100 countries and we see
27:23 - incredible technology solutions that
27:27 - don't normally come out of silicon
27:29 - valley or typical
27:31 - the tech companies because the inventors
27:33 - are people like you they are young
27:35 - people and young people have a very
27:37 - unique perspective so some of my
27:39 - favorite
27:40 - apps and there are so many
27:42 - was a team from bolivia
27:44 - this was a very remote team that lived
27:47 - in the mountains and they learned about
27:49 - this the technovation competition from
27:52 - amazing teacher
27:54 - and um they were very confused because
27:56 - they're like why would we want to create
27:58 - an app and put it on the market and
28:00 - charge uh um for for it and
28:04 - the mentor was a little surprised and
28:05 - then they realized like this
28:07 - town or this area was so remote that
28:09 - they don't use money they actually
28:12 - barter but they all had smartphones
28:15 - and so
28:16 - the girls thought a lot about
28:19 - what could be some problems that
28:20 - technology could help them with and they
28:23 - realized that they spent
28:26 - most of their time walking because this
28:28 - top place was very remote
28:31 - and so they created an app where you
28:33 - could scan a qr code
28:35 - how many of you know what a qr code is
28:39 - so that white and black image so they
28:41 - printed it on paper and then they put
28:44 - these printouts on rocks all over the
28:47 - village for like 10 miles and so you
28:49 - could scan this qr code and while you
28:51 - were walking you could learn how to code
28:53 - you could learn math because they felt
28:55 - that that was very important and they
28:57 - could learn the language that was their
28:59 - native language that was dying out and
29:01 - that app was so powerful because i felt
29:05 - that
29:06 - a typical engineer from silicon valley
29:08 - would never create an app like that and
29:11 - it um it is a representation of a voice
29:14 - that is
29:16 - small but a voice that is very powerful
29:18 - and that's what technology can do it can
29:20 - amplify one person's voice
29:23 - awesome drew would you like to share
29:25 - even also not only problems that can
29:27 - solve but how does cs look here in santa
29:29 - fe
29:30 - sure
29:31 - um
29:32 - in relation the problems that cs can
29:35 - solve one of the one of the most
29:36 - fascinating questions that i remember
29:39 - when i worked at autodesk was this
29:41 - question about how can design and
29:44 - programming for us basically uh
29:47 - help improve the world where there's 7.5
29:50 - billion people and so in every project
29:53 - that we work on we always think about
29:55 - that question and so
29:58 - in relation to
30:00 - computer science and 3d printing there's
30:02 - so much room for improvement within 3d
30:04 - printing and additive manufacturing so
30:07 - that the the themes that we actually
30:09 - create are
30:11 - more sustainable for the environment and
30:14 - with a real focus on uh climate change
30:16 - and so within santa fe itself uh at
30:20 - least through meow wolf
30:23 - we we participate in a lot of different
30:26 - steam
30:27 - and stem
30:28 - different types of workshops locally
30:31 - in terms of the schools
30:33 - i think there's a lot of opportunities
30:35 - for during the summer time for you to
30:37 - look at like the community college in
30:40 - terms of taking courses for uh for
30:43 - computer science um and so yeah i think
30:46 - that's awesome good stuff um so my next
30:49 - question is going to be for jordan to
30:51 - piggyback off of your facebook comment
30:54 - um we always hear with great power comes
30:56 - great responsibility
30:58 - and we know with computer science it
31:00 - unlocks so many powerful things that we
31:02 - can do for the world and to change the
31:04 - world
31:05 - but there's an ethics piece to that and
31:07 - so i'm curious what you think creators
31:09 - should be aware of when they're building
31:10 - this new technology and they're creating
31:12 - this new technology for people to use
31:15 - um so
31:17 - does everybody remember when the
31:18 - standing rock protest was happening a
31:20 - few years ago
31:22 - um so at facebook um they have a policy
31:26 - um that requires you to use your real
31:28 - name so that people don't go on and use
31:30 - pseudo names like you could on myspace
31:32 - or like other platforms you know where
31:34 - you can have a username
31:36 - but when standing rock was happening
31:38 - there were a lot of people posting
31:40 - videos and live streaming right that
31:42 - they were protesting they were there and
31:43 - we were occupying
31:45 - and unfortunately because the politics
31:47 - were so strong you know during around
31:49 - what's happening there in the keystone
31:51 - pipeline there were a lot of other
31:53 - people on facebook who were trying to
31:55 - block those people from being able to
31:58 - live stream so they were reporting them
32:01 - for having an inauthentic name
32:03 - um and so
32:05 - on the facebook side what was happening
32:07 - was these accounts were being flagged as
32:10 - being inauthentic and the team who was
32:12 - responsible for going through every
32:15 - single name and making sure that it was
32:16 - real
32:17 - didn't actually realize that there are a
32:19 - lot of native names out there in the
32:21 - world that sound very different than
32:23 - what we traditionally hear in western in
32:25 - western society right so you know
32:29 - you know
32:30 - elk eagle and bear walks and you know
32:33 - all our relatives that have names that
32:35 - are different or if you're from the
32:36 - southwest and you have you know
32:38 - different sounding names that
32:39 - people are not used to hearing they
32:41 - weren't able to actually decide or
32:44 - identify whether or not those names were
32:46 - real because they didn't have that
32:47 - experience with native people so it was
32:50 - flagged internally some of us that
32:51 - worked there my mom included got
32:53 - involved with the team that was
32:55 - responsible for managing that and we
32:57 - worked with them to bring in somebody
32:58 - from the community who could help
33:00 - educate them on some cultural competency
33:02 - to say here's some examples of the kinds
33:04 - of native names that you may come across
33:06 - here also is a suggestion to add a
33:10 - tribal id as a form of identification
33:12 - that people can use to validate
33:14 - themselves if their account gets
33:15 - reported so now on facebook you can use
33:17 - your tribal id to to validate yourself
33:20 - the point being that what we did was we
33:23 - educated people
33:24 - internally we helped solve this problem
33:26 - a lot faster and the only way we would
33:29 - have been able to do that is if we had
33:31 - representation inside of facebook we
33:33 - were able to actually solve that problem
33:35 - so continuing my message that it's
33:37 - important that we're well represented
33:39 - and remember that wherever you work you
33:41 - come from the community that you come
33:43 - from and you can help solve problems
33:45 - that other people might not otherwise be
33:46 - able to
33:48 - that's awesome
33:50 - tara i'd love for you and drew to also
33:53 - kind of ask
33:54 - the ethics piece especially because you
33:56 - guys are dealing with tech innovations
33:58 - with um your mouth like how you're kind
34:01 - of getting the ethics um taken care of
34:04 - as far as people understanding wanting
34:05 - to build these things but understanding
34:06 - that power they need to be responsible
34:08 - with it
34:10 - yeah i think
34:12 - in our in our curriculum in the program
34:16 - we start with find a problem that you
34:18 - face
34:19 - and right away that prompt makes it a
34:22 - personal problem
34:24 - and sometimes um
34:26 - people don't mean harm right like you
34:29 - you create a prototype you create a
34:30 - solution and then because it's for the
34:33 - world you launch it into the world
34:35 - and it's an interesting exercise to see
34:38 - well
34:39 - what were the unintended consequences of
34:42 - what you just did
34:43 - so for instance um and we as organizers
34:46 - and an education non-profit are also
34:48 - learning what types of tools should we
34:50 - provide to students so you're thinking
34:52 - about it not after the damage is done
34:54 - but a little bit before and sometimes
34:57 - these things can be very very hard
34:58 - because technology innovation means that
35:00 - it did not exist before so it's hard to
35:03 - kind of
35:04 - predict what's going to happen so one
35:06 - example was one team
35:10 - earlier this year created an image
35:12 - recognition system
35:13 - to help
35:15 - children with autism and and
35:18 - it was autism and down syndrome and
35:21 - um
35:22 - and right away it would it would look at
35:24 - people's faces and try to distinguish
35:27 - whether a person needed help or a child
35:30 - needed help or not and from the team's
35:33 - perspective it was meant to help
35:35 - but right away from if you were to hear
35:37 - about it you're like that doesn't sound
35:39 - right
35:40 - um and so there are many instances like
35:43 - that when you're trying to create so
35:45 - technology can be very powerful because
35:47 - immediately when you put it online
35:49 - thousands of people can use it a lot of
35:51 - data can be generated you have to think
35:53 - through a little bit about what are the
35:56 - good and bad things that could happen uh
35:59 - that you did not intend and so the best
36:01 - way to do that is to actually bring
36:03 - together a group of people from
36:04 - different who are not like you
36:06 - and to get their perspective even before
36:08 - you launch it because you will learn so
36:10 - much from that and it's simple it's
36:12 - really just you have some humility and
36:15 - you're just wanting to hear from people
36:16 - so that's a it's a it's an interesting
36:18 - and a fun way and will make your product
36:19 - so much better
36:25 - one of
36:26 - one of the fascinating things about um
36:29 - technology just in general is
36:31 - this
36:32 - attraction to innovate just for the sake
36:35 - of technology and just for the sake of
36:37 - innovation and that could be a trap if
36:39 - you're not thinking about just to re uh
36:42 - iterate what tara was talking about
36:44 - what kind of solutions are you trying to
36:46 - solve what's the good what is the bad in
36:49 - relation that and so for example when i
36:51 - was at autodesk we were doing a lot of
36:53 - research in relation to
36:55 - robotics and so i would hack into robots
36:58 - and try to find the sweet spot between
37:01 - what a person brings to the table and
37:02 - what a robot does the the the challenge
37:05 - within that scenario was does a robot
37:08 - replace a human and a job basically
37:11 - so that was an interesting
37:13 - thing to consider the other
37:15 - in relation to meow wolf and what i do
37:17 - on a very regular basis technology can
37:20 - we use it for lighting we use it for
37:23 - sound uh engineering tech fabrication we
37:26 - use it basically to enhance the story
37:29 - and enhance the emotions and so the most
37:32 - important question there really is what
37:34 - is the story that we're trying to tell
37:36 - what are we really trying to have people
37:39 - think about and question in relation to
37:41 - day-to-day uh their day-to-day lives and
37:44 - so
37:45 - it's not technology for the sake of
37:47 - technology but it's really there as a
37:50 - means to
37:51 - help you
37:53 - you know
37:54 - explore the world and try to find better
37:57 - answers than what we presented in the
37:58 - past
38:07 - i think that's a big um
38:10 - thing to think about is the good and bad
38:12 - and i even want to kind of ask emma with
38:15 - you developing your own app
38:17 - dealing with facial recognition and we
38:19 - understand the ethics behind facial
38:20 - recognition sometimes
38:22 - there's some boundaries that can be
38:23 - crossed what did you consider when you
38:25 - were developing your app as far as the
38:27 - ethics piece
38:28 - yeah so there's definitely a lot of you
38:30 - know data privacy concerns that we um
38:33 - that i as a developer and also you know
38:34 - the ui ux designers i work with we do
38:36 - consider a lot interesting how do we
38:38 - store people's data what kind of data do
38:40 - we collect actually
38:42 - in the latest release that we just had
38:44 - we actually released a kind of a more
38:45 - global release this weekend we did a
38:47 - soft launch in may and so we're kind of
38:49 - expanding out um we did take a look at
38:51 - you know when we have users register um
38:54 - do you want to take the patient's
38:55 - address because you know originally we
38:56 - think well with my own grandmother we
38:58 - write down her address for her in case
39:00 - that she doesn't remember and she can't
39:01 - find her way back home um and so we
39:04 - wanted to take into consideration and
39:06 - ask people out out there who would
39:08 - potentially use the app you know would
39:09 - you like us to take your address is that
39:11 - something that you'd be comfortable
39:12 - sharing with us
39:13 - and so thinking about those kinds of
39:15 - considerations and taking into account
39:16 - other people's privacy concerns and
39:18 - their level of you know
39:21 - their level of comfort with sharing
39:23 - their data especially because i'm
39:24 - working with
39:25 - an older generation that isn't as used
39:27 - to technology has been something that's
39:29 - been kind of interesting throughout my
39:30 - journey creating timeless
39:33 - so my next question to
39:35 - kind of
39:36 - summate as far as cs for good is what
39:39 - are you doing right now that is cs for
39:42 - good um before we kind of give a charge
39:45 - to the audience and the students because
39:46 - we want them to engage in cs for good
39:48 - what are you doing right now currently
39:50 - with cs for good
39:52 - i think my focus really is on empowering
39:54 - the populations that you know
39:56 - traditional tech industry might not have
39:57 - looked at um i think you know a lot of
39:59 - the time when we think of you know the
40:00 - older generation especially alzheimer's
40:02 - patients we think you know they can't
40:04 - use technology it's not really their
40:05 - world but i think that the meaning of
40:07 - technology and innovation is really
40:09 - accessibility and empowerment and
40:11 - bringing you know these benefits to not
40:13 - only the people who we see using them on
40:15 - a day-to-day basis but also those who
40:17 - could benefit from them but aren't
40:19 - getting those benefits right now um and
40:21 - so that's why i've really been pushing
40:22 - for not only you know creating timeless
40:25 - and developing timeless but also in
40:26 - general pushing for people to take into
40:28 - consideration those around them who
40:30 - maybe aren't being touched by technology
40:32 - and really could benefit from it
40:33 - especially because you know right now
40:35 - people aren't designing for the older
40:38 - population and so what i really think
40:39 - about a lot is how do we design this so
40:41 - it's really easy to use and it's
40:42 - understandable to a different kind of
40:44 - population and so i think that's
40:46 - something that is really meaningful to
40:48 - me because you know my grandmother
40:50 - herself we are using technology with her
40:52 - but that's not something that's very
40:53 - visible outside in our culture and so
40:55 - pushing for that has been really
40:56 - important to me
40:58 - um yeah i mentioned that you know
41:00 - my mission in life is just to
41:03 - represent us as native people in tech
41:05 - and try to create some connections
41:07 - between our communities and what's
41:08 - happening in in the tech world
41:11 - i think two things are really top of
41:13 - mind for me right now one is i love
41:17 - participating in events like this just
41:19 - to come out and speak to other folks and
41:20 - say hey there's other native people in
41:22 - silicon valley or in other parts of the
41:24 - tech world so if you're interested you
41:26 - know there are there's a community of us
41:28 - out in other parts of of the country
41:31 - and so i love doing this kind of work
41:33 - and just talking about what we're doing
41:35 - the other is that you know i work at
41:36 - pinterest so right now my mission is to
41:40 - help us as indigenous people who work at
41:42 - pinterest we have a small community
41:44 - look at the platform itself and say how
41:47 - can we make this better how can we make
41:49 - our content that people might want to
41:51 - try to find on pinterest relevant and
41:54 - current so that it's not stereotyping us
41:57 - so that it doesn't look as something
41:59 - that is old or you know dated and so
42:02 - right now we're focused on trying to
42:03 - look at all of the pins and the content
42:06 - that's on pinterest and look at what
42:07 - people might actually be searching for
42:09 - and say how do we make this up to date
42:12 - how do we represent us as who we are
42:14 - today
42:15 - so that's what i'm focused on right now
42:18 - so i have a question for you how many of
42:20 - you have a smartphone
42:23 - how many of you think you can make an
42:26 - app for that phone
42:30 - you know
42:32 - so
42:32 - so if you go to
42:34 - technovation.org there's a full
42:36 - curriculum
42:37 - where you can just go step by step by
42:39 - step and you need to know nothing about
42:41 - coding but at the end of three months
42:45 - you'll actually have created an app that
42:48 - you can use your friends can use your
42:49 - family can use the world can use
42:52 - and you can think about what are some
42:54 - things that have been frustrating you
42:57 - and think a little bit about how can
43:00 - technology help ease that frustration
43:02 - and then you actually have an idea and
43:04 - that idea is completely you it's unique
43:07 - it's your voice and you should bring
43:09 - that voice to the world
43:16 - right now i'm at
43:18 - having grown up and and lived in new
43:20 - mexico for
43:21 - a large chunk of my life
43:23 - one of the things that's most important
43:24 - to me is being able to uh provide
43:27 - opportunity for
43:28 - students like yourselves
43:31 - and and build that bridge from not only
43:34 - kindergarten all the way through
43:36 - twelfth grade but into different
43:38 - vocational technical schools
43:40 - universities and then into companies
43:43 - like meow wolf and so
43:46 - not only myself but a large number of
43:49 - my co-workers
43:51 - are participate on a very regular basis
43:54 - in terms of
43:55 - different steam types of events we
43:57 - follow jennifer novaris on a very
44:00 - regular basis to
44:02 - help out
44:03 - in communities like zuni in terms of
44:05 - workshops for
44:06 - how to program with arduino and
44:08 - raspberry pi
44:09 - etc and so for me the good part of that
44:12 - is really trying to help educate
44:16 - students like yourself so that you have
44:18 - the opportunity like i mentioned before
44:20 - to be able to stay here within new
44:22 - mexico if you want to not have to move
44:24 - away from this beautiful state
44:27 - all right our last uh question is kind
44:30 - of a charge for our audience here and
44:32 - also our live stream audience is how
44:34 - would you encourage students to use cs
44:37 - for good
44:39 - i think you know in order to encourage
44:41 - students to use cs for good from a
44:43 - teacher side also people working in the
44:45 - industry to really embrace the change
44:47 - that students want to see and for
44:48 - students themselves to really push for
44:50 - that change because i think that you
44:51 - know myself when i was a middle school
44:53 - student i was you know 12 or 13 years
44:55 - old i just started emailing you know
44:57 - these ctos who you know worked for these
44:59 - facial recognition companies and asking
45:01 - you know would you like to be my mentor
45:03 - for this project i'd like to do and i
45:05 - think that the most meaningful mentors
45:06 - were the ones that i found who really
45:08 - believed in my vision and really also
45:10 - were passionate about it and also
45:12 - treated me as an equal and saw that the
45:13 - change that i wanted to create was
45:15 - something that was viable and that's
45:17 - something that if we all kind of put in
45:19 - the resources and he could you know
45:20 - guide me through the process with
45:21 - something that was tangible and really
45:23 - meaningful and beneficial and so i think
45:25 - that for you know the adults also to
45:28 - kind of really embrace this change and
45:31 - also you know take kids seriously and
45:33 - listen to what they want to see
45:34 - happen in the world and to help to make
45:36 - that happen
45:39 - i would say you know think about a
45:41 - problem that you care a lot about if
45:43 - it's you know the environment if it's
45:46 - politics if it's social media or
45:49 - connections or your community or people
45:51 - or health care whatever it is that's
45:53 - important to you it's unique to you
45:56 - think about how you can connect the
45:59 - technology world with that
46:02 - because there are so many problems yet
46:03 - to be solved and all of us have the
46:05 - ability to help solve them
46:07 - but what will really drive and fuel that
46:10 - is how much you care about it
46:12 - and so the more that you actually
46:13 - genuinely feel like you want to be a
46:15 - part of that change and maybe one day
46:17 - look back and say the legacy that i left
46:20 - behind is that i worked on this i was a
46:23 - part of that project or i met all of
46:25 - these incredible people who also worked
46:27 - on amazing projects that i helped
46:29 - support or that i knew or that i was
46:31 - championing from the sideline
46:34 - so think about what you care about and
46:36 - also support those around you who are
46:38 - also doing really great things
46:42 - so i would say that believe that age is
46:45 - no barrier if you're eight years old
46:47 - nine years old or ten years old if
46:49 - technology like harley said is a
46:51 - superpower so it enables you to make a
46:54 - change in the world that you live in so
46:56 - don't wait until you're a grown-up or an
46:58 - adult or you have a job or there's
47:00 - absolutely nothing stopping you you can
47:03 - go online you can teach yourself how to
47:06 - build things but it really the power
47:08 - lies in you and you have to sort of wake
47:10 - up and say i don't need to complain i
47:12 - can actually fix this problem
47:15 - and begin to take steps towards that
47:17 - bring your friends bring two or three
47:18 - friends work in a team and it'll be the
47:20 - most powerful experience of your life so
47:22 - don't wait
47:25 - i love all that that's all super
47:27 - important and
47:28 - when i was your age
47:30 - computer programming basically meant we
47:31 - had these punch cards and i don't know
47:33 - if you've ever seen these punch cards
47:35 - but i would do something like two plus
47:36 - two
47:37 - i would program that on the punch card i
47:40 - would mail that out you would wait two
47:42 - weeks to be able to find out that it was
47:43 - four
47:44 - and there was one computer mysteriously
47:47 - somewhere and it was the size of a room
47:50 - right now you are so
47:52 - lucky in that you have
47:55 - uh access to be able to go to
47:58 - websites like code.org or you have tools
48:01 - like littlebits or you can program
48:04 - within scratch and if you don't have
48:06 - those the little bits go to your
48:08 - librarian ask for it if you don't have
48:10 - access to scratch or any computer
48:14 - science programs within your schools go
48:15 - to your teachers and ask for it because
48:19 - your demand and the demand for that
48:21 - they'll listen to that hopefully and
48:22 - we'll be able to uh make that much more
48:24 - accessible to you but in general you
48:27 - have so many different tools that are
48:29 - available for you to at least build that
48:31 - foundation to begin with and then the
48:33 - next steps after that are
48:35 - what kind of good can you can you use
48:37 - that new uh skill set for
48:40 - i'd like to thank our panelists um for
48:42 - sharing your brilliance
48:44 - and your wisdom with our live studio
48:46 - audits can we get a round of applause

59:22 - i'd like to personally thank all the
59:23 - folks at the computer science teachers

59:38 - jake
59:38 - alexis and paige thank you so much and i
59:41 - want to give a special thank you as well
59:43 - to a person who i'm so proud that agreed
59:45 - to join our team at the public education
59:47 - department dr
59:49 - gwen warden thank you so much just
59:50 - wanted to just say thank you for that
59:56 - so much is taking place when you talk
59:58 - about the movement for computer science
60:00 - and having that opportunity brought back
60:02 - those memories like i shared a while ago
60:04 - i can remember back in 1989 1990 being
60:08 - in that high school classroom where my
60:10 - computer science teacher mrs uh peggy
60:13 - back then we were on the apple two e's
60:15 - where we still had the floppy disks and
60:17 - we learned a little bit about
60:19 - using the computer and a little bit
60:21 - about coding a little bit about what
60:23 - that meant for communication
60:25 - and fast forwarding and i shared the
60:28 - story of covre high school
60:30 - i can remember when i would go to the
60:32 - library or go somewhere usually in a
60:35 - school setting to utilize a computer and
60:37 - to get to know that a little bit more
60:40 - i can remember when growing up we didn't
60:42 - have much money and my father was a
60:44 - minor my mother was a teacher assistant
60:47 - but i remember the day that my father
60:49 - bought me a computer
60:51 - he saved up money and tried to assist me
60:54 - along my journey as i began my doctorate
60:57 - work and i sat there with that computer
61:00 - and i went over and over and over and
61:02 - actually a logo that i created for the
61:03 - baseball program took many hours
61:06 - learning
61:07 - exploring
61:09 - the potential of communicating with that
61:11 - computer
61:13 - and so when i look and see the impact
61:14 - that that's had on my life
61:17 - it's personal to me
61:18 - and i share that with you because my
61:20 - father passed away less than two months
61:21 - ago
61:22 - but the gift that he was able to give me
61:24 - and to share
61:26 - has been so impactful that i went on to
61:28 - get my phd not only in curriculum
61:30 - instruction but in the powers and uses
61:32 - of learning technology and assisting
61:34 - special education students
61:36 - many of you have a same story and give a
61:38 - round of applause for those stories that
61:40 - have brought you where you're at today
61:46 - so as you know in new mexico there's a
61:48 - lot of momentum and we're excited about
61:50 - the pathway that we're taking in
61:52 - education because we understand that
61:54 - everything begins and ends with
61:56 - education
61:57 - and fortunately
61:59 - under the governor michelle lujan
62:00 - grisham administration under the
62:02 - direction of public education department
62:04 - what we've seen is that new mexico has
62:06 - established a computer science
62:08 - education task force made up of more
62:11 - than 40 individuals bringing people from
62:13 - all sectors together to ensure that we
62:16 - are going to provide recommendations to
62:17 - include a statewide strategic plan this
62:20 - is significant
62:21 - because we recognize
62:23 - the importance of computer science
62:25 - within our daily curriculum
62:27 - and i can tell you that many times
62:29 - there's a lot of myths
62:31 - that we hear in our society we laugh
62:32 - about those myths we don't think twice
62:34 - about them
62:35 - you remember some of those myths you
62:37 - better not cross your eyes why not
62:39 - they'll stay that way you better not eat
62:40 - that watermelon seed how come
62:43 - it'll stay in your stomach and then some
62:44 - of you and you didn't get home when you
62:46 - should have you know that lady that
62:47 - walks the river right there leorona she
62:49 - was going to come and get you
62:51 - we laugh about it we don't even think
62:52 - twice about some of those myths
62:54 - but there are some myths out there that
62:56 - could be harmful
62:58 - and i share these myths that could be
62:59 - harmful
63:00 - because we have to make sure that not
63:02 - only in our state are we addressing it
63:05 - but across the country and across the
63:06 - world
63:08 - one of those myths says that to be good
63:10 - enough
63:11 - is to be good enough or to be average is
63:13 - okay
63:14 - the reality in our society is that many
63:17 - times it's not that we aim too high and
63:19 - that we miss
63:20 - many times is that we aim too low when
63:22 - we hit
63:23 - and we stop growing stop challenging
63:25 - ourselves stop
63:28 - pursuing
63:29 - the things
63:30 - that can make us great and i think in
63:32 - the state of new mexico even though
63:33 - we've done some wonderful things in this
63:35 - last legislative session
63:37 - and years before that that we've seen
63:38 - some movement taking place we can still
63:40 - do more
63:41 - and i believe that we can do more and
63:43 - get to be great by ensuring that we have
63:46 - the support for all of our computer
63:48 - science educators across the state of
63:49 - new mexico that we can offer stipends
63:51 - that we can offer training
63:53 - that's so necessary
63:55 - to bring that expertise and to build on
63:58 - the expertise that we already have
64:00 - one of those other myths out there
64:03 - that could be harmful
64:04 - is when we hear the myth that we have to
64:06 - focus on reading and math because
64:08 - reading and math is what
64:10 - is measured reading and math is going to
64:12 - be on those standardized tests
64:15 - well i have to believe
64:16 - that not only does computer science need
64:19 - to be part of our daily schedules
64:21 - and our curriculum
64:23 - we have to recognize that it is a
64:25 - component an added component
64:28 - that is going to be instrumental in
64:30 - expanding our learning opportunities and
64:32 - capabilities you see for too long in our
64:34 - country
64:36 - we've been chasing the elusive student
64:38 - achievement scores
64:39 - when in reality we should all long be
64:42 - chasing student engagement computer
64:44 - science gives us that opportunity to
64:46 - have student engagement on areas of
64:49 - interest right there that'll increase
64:51 - the opportunities
64:52 - to continue to grow and to learn
64:54 - you see when i question as a high school
64:56 - student why do we have to take algebra
64:59 - why do we have to take chemistry why do
65:01 - we have to take these subjects i'm never
65:02 - going to use them
65:03 - and it was explained to me
65:05 - the reasoning behind that
65:07 - because the development of the brain the
65:10 - critical thinking those aspects that
65:12 - continue to be developed
65:14 - are the same exact ways that we see the
65:17 - improvements
65:18 - and the connectivity
65:20 - and the critical thinking and the
65:22 - exploration pieces of our brain that
65:24 - comes with computer science
65:26 - and the last myth that i want to share
65:28 - with you that probably is the greatest
65:29 - myth of all yet gives us the most power
65:32 - and when i share that with you
65:34 - i think it's important and critical
65:36 - because the myth that says to be loving
65:39 - or kind or compassionate
65:40 - in our society is to be weak
65:42 - you can't be kind you can't be loved
65:45 - especially in the business setting for
65:47 - sure in the political setting because
65:49 - you're just going to get run over
65:51 - and the reason and the truth behind that
65:53 - is that's a myth
65:55 - because to show love kindness and
65:57 - compassion is the most powerful thing
66:00 - that we can ever demonstrate
66:02 - in the society that we live in and how
66:04 - does this tie in with the potential that
66:05 - we have just this last weekend we had an
66:08 - opportunity
66:09 - and it was so inspiring
66:11 - in las lunas high school we hosted the
66:13 - first ever governor's stem challenge
66:16 - where many students came with their
66:17 - ideas of how they can make new mexico
66:20 - healthier and safer
66:22 - and it was great to see the talent that
66:24 - we have all across the state of new
66:26 - mexico
66:27 - and it was inspiring to see
66:29 - all that took place
66:31 - by giving you the opportunity and
66:33 - sharing with educators the resources
66:36 - and the support
66:38 - what we want to make sure that we do is
66:40 - to provide
66:41 - the curriculum
66:43 - opportunities
66:45 - to assist every single one of you
66:46 - students to explore to imagine to create
66:51 - to utilize your computer science
66:53 - research you utilize your computer
66:55 - science opportunities
66:56 - into making this world a more kind
67:00 - compassionate and loving environment
67:02 - that is the goal
67:04 - of each one of us and the responsibility
67:06 - that we all have and what a wonderful
67:08 - way
67:09 - and a wonderful opportunity to join in
67:11 - together
