00:00 - in practice lessons students work
00:03 - independently or in pairs to complete a
00:05 - series of programming challenges
00:08 - this lesson builds students ability to
00:10 - independently program with new concepts
00:13 - and reinforces debugging skills hey
00:16 - class all right today you are mostly
00:18 - going to be practicing what we've
00:20 - already to start a practice lesson
00:22 - you'll run a whole group warm-up that
00:24 - reinforces or introduces debugging
00:26 - bugging skills that we've already
00:28 - learned i've got three of them up here
00:29 - on the board after that students start
00:32 - working on programming challenges either
00:34 - on their own or in pairs
00:38 - most of your time will be spent
00:39 - circulating the room and supporting
00:41 - students either one-on-one or in small
00:43 - groups that's not working
00:45 - oh well hold on let me
00:48 - you know what actually you all can do
00:50 - well attempting
00:51 - you should resist debugging code for
00:53 - students
00:54 - instead ask leading questions to help
00:57 - students hunt for bugs
00:58 - a key goal of practice lessons is to
01:01 - help students develop debugging
01:03 - practices that will help them solve
01:04 - problems independently in the future
01:07 - there's lots of other resources like the
01:10 - help and tips tab code documentation
01:14 - or even code from the investigate lesson
01:17 - that you can point students towards
01:20 - if you notice the whole room is
01:21 - struggling with the same task you may
01:23 - make the decision to bring the whole
01:25 - group together for a discussion folks i
01:27 - am seeing a lot of people get stuck in
01:29 - kind of the same spot if you all want to
01:31 - join me here
01:34 - can i get a can i get a hand somebody
01:36 - what's going on here as you prepare for
01:38 - the lesson you'll want to understand
01:40 - both the programming challenges students
01:42 - will be completing and the debugging
01:44 - skills you'll be encouraging
01:47 - try out the programming challenges
01:48 - yourself and review the debugging skills
01:52 - anticipate places in the lessons where
01:54 - students may have misconceptions about
01:55 - the contented task and consider using
01:58 - the vocabulary and shared men to model
02:01 - to help correct those misconceptions
02:04 - when you're planning decide if you want
02:06 - to utilize pair programming for this
02:07 - lesson you can always pair program for
02:10 - some parts and encourage students to
02:11 - work on their own for other parts yeah
02:13 - it works great
02:15 - during practice lessons students are
02:17 - programming without the teacher at the
02:19 - center of the room but this should not
02:21 - be confused with pure independent
02:23 - creation the practice lesson format
02:25 - moves students towards independent
02:27 - creation by giving them scaffolded
02:29 - challenges we'll see more independent
02:31 - creation coming up in the make lesson
02:35 - [Music]
02:46 - you
