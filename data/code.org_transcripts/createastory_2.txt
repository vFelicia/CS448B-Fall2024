00:00 - Time to get creative and use your coding skills
to tell a story. Your story will have actors
00:04 - and you will be able to make these actors
talk and interact with each other. So create
00:09 - my own game. So I have to move around the
cat and the dog and make them say things.
00:15 - Start thinking of what kind of story you want
to tell. The cat's always been afraid of the
00:19 - dog and what if the cat figures out the
dog is just trying to be nice? The "when run" block
00:25 - starts everything. The "move" block will move
your character and the "say" block will make
00:30 - your character say whatever you type. I was
making the dog come over and say "Hi." She'll
00:36 - be all scared. This is the "when actors collide"
block which you can link up to the other blocks.
00:43 - I was making the dog come over and say "Hi"
but then the cat got scared so it ran away. "Ahh"
00:50 - If there was more time, it would have
been a happy ending. The end!
