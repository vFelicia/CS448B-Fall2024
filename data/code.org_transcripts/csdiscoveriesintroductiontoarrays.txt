00:06 - Hi my name is Erica Gomez
00:07 - and I'm a software development manager at Amazon.
00:10 - I really like it because I get to develop
more junior engineers
00:14 - and help them grow in their careers
00:15 - and find the right opportunities for them.
00:17 - And I have to think more strategically as opposed to tactically.
00:22 - When you're planning out your day,
00:25 - brainstorming ideas for a project,
00:27 - or choosing songs for a party,
00:30 - how do you keep track of all your activities ideas or songs?
00:34 - You probably write them down in a list.
00:38 - Lists help us stay organized by ordering all the relevant pieces of information
00:43 - one after the other in a single place.
00:46 - The same principle applies when we write programs
00:48 - that include many related pieces of information.
00:53 - Variables are useful for keeping track of a single piece of information
00:57 - but as we collect more and more information
01:00 - keeping the variables organized can be complicated.
01:03 - For example what if you wanted to keep
track of
01:06 - everybody's name in class or an entire school?
01:10 - It's impractical to create hundreds or thousands of individual variables
01:15 - and impossible if you don't know how many items
01:17 - should be tracked ahead of time.
01:20 - In JavaScript we can keep track of all these things
01:23 - by using an array.
01:25 - An array is an ordered collection of items.
01:29 - You can think of an array as a row of numbered boxes.
01:32 - Each box can have one item in it.
01:35 - Arrays can hold all types of data -
01:38 - numbers, strings and even other
arrays.
01:47 - Let's see how you could use an array to keep track
01:49 - of the names of people in a group.
01:53 - In JavaScript an array of strings looks like this.
01:58 - Notice that all the items in the array are separated by commas
02:02 - and the entire array is in brackets.
02:04 - Just like how you can assign a number
02:06 - or a string to a variable
02:08 - like "var X gets 5" you can also assign an array to a variable
02:13 - to use it later like this.
02:17 - Every time you make a new array
02:18 - you'll want to assign it to a variable so that you can find it again.
02:22 - Your array can be as long as you want.
02:24 - Just use the arrow keys on the side of the block
02:26 - to make it longer or shorter.
02:33 - To access an individual item from your
array write out the name of the array
02:38 - and the number of the box you want to
access... like this.
02:45 - This means give me the item in the list "names" sitting in slot number two.
02:51 - The official term for slot number 2 is "index".
02:55 - You might have noticed that the first index in the array is 0.
02:59 - In programming we usually start counting at 0,
03:02 - which means that names at index 0 is the first item of the array.
03:07 - And names at index 2 is actually the third item in the array.
03:12 - When your program runs, the computer will look up the current value
03:15 - that lives at the given index of the
array.
03:17 - Just like the computer looks up the current value of a variable.
03:21 - Arrays are a very powerful way to write programs that use large amounts of data.
03:26 - They open the door for us to write
03:28 - programs that use and process lots and
lots of information.
03:32 - Especially when we don't know ahead of time
03:34 - just how much information needs to be stored.
03:36 - Let's try them out.
