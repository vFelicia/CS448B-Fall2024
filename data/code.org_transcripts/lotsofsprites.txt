00:07 - With just a couple of sprites,
00:08 - you can make fun and interactive 
projects like animations,
00:13 - stories, greeting cards and more.
00:20 - To make more complex games 
and simulations,
00:23 - you're probably going to want 
a lot of sprites.
00:27 - When you have a group of sprites 
with the same costume,
00:30 - actions will usually affect all of them.
00:33 - You can make three strawberries like this
00:36 - and then change the size of all of them
with one set size block.
00:41 - If you only want to change 
the size of one of the sprites,
00:45 - you'll need to use events.
00:47 - This event block is triggered
when a sprite is clicked.
00:52 - If we move the set size block 
over to this event,
00:56 - what will happen 
when the user clicks a sprite?
00:59 - The event tells the computer 
to wait for the click
01:03 - and then respond by changing
the size of all the strawberries.
01:08 - That's pretty cool.
01:09 - But that's not exactly what we wanted.
01:11 - Events like this one can be expanded 
with this button.
01:16 - This special block inside
lets you control the single sprite
01:20 - that is actually clicked.
01:23 - Let's change out this block.
01:25 - When we run the program this time,
01:28 - we can change the size 
of each sprite one at a time.
01:33 - You can use this to create 
simple programs
01:36 - like a game that tests 
how fast you can click
01:38 - to remove sprites from the screen.
01:41 - Let's look at another program.
01:43 - Here's a game in progress.
01:45 - The bunnies are going to wander around 
and eat the carrots.
01:48 - This block says 
"when touches" and it's an event
01:54 - that involves two different sprites.
01:57 - If you have lots of sprites 
with these costumes,
02:01 - the special block inside the event block,
02:04 - makes sure that things only happen 
to the sprites that actually touch.
02:20 - Understanding groups of sprites 
can take some practise,
02:23 - but once you get the hang of it,
02:24 - you'll be able to create amazing games 
and powerful simulations
02:28 - with just a few blocks of code.
