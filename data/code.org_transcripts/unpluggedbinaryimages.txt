00:06 - For each team, the person who's instructing, that's
the person who's holding the paper.
00:11 - They have to figure out what their "off" symbol is going
to be, and what their "on" symbol is going to be.
00:24 - What I'm going to do, is I'm going
to say: the black ones are going to be 1.
00:30 - and the white ones are going to be 2. Ready?
00:35 - Ok! 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2.
00:40 - In binary, it's like an alphabet with two letters.
00:44 - Like having A and B be your entire alphabet.
00:47 - But you've got a 0 and a 1.
00:50 - The most common
way you use binary is in an if statement.
00:53 - It's a classic thing from programming. The
program runs along and it says:
00:58 - "if: something is true, then do this. Or it's not true and
you do something else. "
01:04 - What if you want to do something maybe a little more complicated?
01:07 - Instead an if statement, you want to work with something like an image or sound in a computer.
01:13 - A computer only knows binary. But an image, is not binary, it's not ones and zeroes.
01:18 - How do you do that? Here's an example.
01:21 - You have this beautiful picture. Now a picture
is basically a form of information.
01:29 - All information can be encoded in binary one way or another. can be encoded in binary one way or another,
01:33 - you just have to figure out how to do it.
01:36 - With this picture, the first thing we're going to do is...
01:38 - This all happens with your imagination mostly.
01:42 - Then you translate your imagination
into code.
01:45 - You imagine that we'll put a grid over this panda bear. For each square,
01:50 - We'll decide if that square is more black or more white.
01:53 - Then we'll color it that way, accordingly.
01:55 - Each cell on the grid is either black or white, and for the black squares,
02:00 - we say those are zeros (binary digit), and the white squares are ones, the other binary digit.
02:07 - At the end, you're left with just a bunch of ones and
zeros.
02:11 - That's how you represent this image in binary.
