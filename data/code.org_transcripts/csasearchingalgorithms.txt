00:10 - let's say we're at the library looking
00:11 - for a specific book
00:13 - there are many books on the shelf but
00:15 - the books are not labeled
00:17 - the librarian let us know that the books
00:19 - are in alphabetical order
00:21 - how are we supposed to find the book
00:22 - we're looking for
00:24 - we could try doing a linear search
00:26 - a linear search is a search algorithm
00:28 - that checks each item in order until the
00:30 - target is found
00:32 - so we could start by checking the first
00:33 - book then the second book and so on this
00:36 - could work but it'll take a while
00:39 - we might have to check all the books on
00:40 - the shelf to find what we're looking for
00:43 - a linear search works best for a
00:45 - relatively small unsorted list
00:48 - we could try doing a binary search
00:51 - a binary search is a search algorithm
00:53 - that finds a target element in a sorted
00:55 - list by dividing the list in half in
00:58 - each iteration
00:59 - we first start by checking the book in
01:01 - the middle
01:02 - then we know if the book we're looking
01:04 - for comes before or after the book we
01:06 - picked up
01:08 - this eliminates half the books we need
01:10 - to check
01:12 - then we can start at the middle of the
01:13 - books that remain
01:15 - with the strategy we can find the book
01:17 - we're looking for much faster
01:20 - a binary search can only be used with a
01:22 - sorted list it is more efficient than a
01:25 - linear search especially when working
01:27 - with a larger list
01:29 - the runtime of different algorithms can
01:31 - be compared by looking at the statement
01:33 - execution count
01:34 - the execution count is the number of
01:36 - times a code segment runs
01:39 - the binary search is more efficient
01:41 - because it has fewer checks to perform
01:44 - there are a couple of options when it
01:45 - comes to searching through a data set
01:47 - if the list is not too large a linear
01:50 - search is the way to go
01:52 - if the list is sorted a binary search
01:54 - can be used and is more efficient
