00:10 - hello everyone out there welcome to
00:12 - code.org cs journeys class chat my name
00:16 - is pat youngpraddit and i'm code.org's
00:18 - chief academic officer i'm here in
00:20 - maryland and i want to welcome our
00:22 - panelists today
00:24 - anna and ava from irobot anna ava why
00:28 - don't you say hi hello hi good morning
00:31 - everyone
00:32 - we are gonna start with a fun icebreaker
00:35 - all right kids um
00:37 - and uh our panelists don't know what the
00:39 - icebreaker is so this is totally
00:41 - impromptu
00:42 - and what we're going to do is we're
00:44 - going to play a game of would you rather
00:47 - all right
00:48 - and
00:49 - the thing here with this game of would
00:51 - you rather is you actually have to do
00:52 - the thing that you would rather
00:54 - so
00:56 - anna
00:57 - ava
00:58 - would you rather
01:00 - dance the robot
01:03 - like for us actually dance the robot
01:06 - or
01:08 - sing some lyrics from a recent song you
01:12 - played or heard or whatever
01:14 - oh i'll let you think about that and
01:16 - since since you know i'm putting you on
01:18 - the spot and it takes a maybe a teeny
01:21 - bit of prep
01:22 - um i'm gonna
01:24 - allow you to pick one for me okay
01:28 - no okay
01:29 - you can pick for me i you know either
01:32 - one i'm like kind of like 50 50. pick
01:34 - one for me
01:36 - ava what are you feeling like
01:38 - i want to hear pat sing
01:40 - too a hundred percent okay all right so
01:44 - anna and ava know that uh know the song
01:47 - that i've been listening to and it has
01:48 - something to do with uh
01:50 - uh
01:51 - a question i'm gonna ask our panelists
01:53 - later on but the a recent song that i've
01:56 - been listening to a lot is one of my
01:58 - favorite songs it's from the 90s by
02:00 - nelly it's a song called air force ones
02:03 - okay so i'm gonna wrap
02:04 - just the first few words okay kids and
02:08 - this is the clean version kids
02:10 - so this is this is from the 90s kids
02:12 - probably before you were born
02:14 - um
02:16 - give me two purse i need to
02:21 - burst so i can get to stomping in my air
02:23 - force one big boy stomping in my air
02:26 - force once
02:31 - all right see that's what happens when
02:33 - you play would you rather and you
02:34 - actually act it out now what's up with
02:36 - anna anna would you rather
02:38 - do the robot or
02:40 - lyrics from a recent song um i think i'm
02:44 - gonna have to embrace my dance moves uh
02:47 - and do the robot eva what are you
02:50 - feeling like is this going to be a
02:51 - coordinated dance or are you going to go
02:53 - solo i we should coordinate that dance
02:56 - because
02:57 - okay okay okay so
03:00 - uh we're we're doing this we're dancing
03:02 - the robot count of three ready
03:04 - one
03:05 - two three i robot does a robot
03:12 - yes there you go
03:14 - very good
03:16 - all right i robot doing the robot that's
03:20 - amazing um
03:22 - you know what else is amazing
03:24 - uh their jobs so uh let's start off with
03:28 - just uh having anna neva telling us
03:30 - about their work what do you do and how
03:32 - does your work help your community we'll
03:35 - start with ava
03:37 - sure um
03:38 - so what i do on a day to day is i'm
03:41 - mostly in a lot of meetings
03:43 - but i get to be in
03:45 - a lot of meetings with a lot of cool
03:47 - people
03:48 - uh where we all kind of sit together and
03:51 - collaborate and think of how we can
03:53 - solve some of
03:55 - uh the hard problems that the company's
03:57 - facing or what cool features can go on
04:00 - the robot
04:01 - um for example we had a meeting
04:04 - for our last robot where we discussed
04:06 - some of the features and um poop
04:09 - detection was one of them
04:11 - so i got to work with
04:13 - to be clear for kids poop detection
04:17 - yes poop detection so the robot will
04:21 - drive around your house and if your pet
04:24 - if your dog or your cat
04:26 - did a no-no on the floor
04:29 - uh
04:30 - you know the robot will see it and it
04:31 - will drive around it instead of you know
04:34 - smearing it all over your house
04:38 - yeah that's important which nobody wants
04:41 - yeah
04:42 - that's important yeah
04:44 - sounds cool ava anna what do you do
04:46 - yeah well um i'm also in a lot of
04:49 - meetings with ava um outside of work and
04:52 - inside of work but at my job my job as a
04:54 - learning designer which i had never
04:56 - heard of before and i used to be a
04:59 - teacher and it feels like i'm still a
05:01 - teacher in this job so a lot of your
05:04 - students in the crowd right you have
05:05 - your teachers that are planning lessons
05:07 - and really fun activities to help you
05:09 - learn different things
05:10 - and that's what i get to do in my job
05:12 - i get to do it with one of our super
05:14 - cool educational robots called root
05:17 - so
05:18 - everybody
05:19 - this is root
05:21 - root is a super cool awesome robot that
05:24 - has lots of sensors and features like
05:26 - eva was talking about
05:27 - um we have light sensors in the eyes so
05:30 - it can detect if it's bright or if it's
05:31 - darker outside
05:33 - there's touch sensors here on the top of
05:35 - our robot so you can touch them and code
05:37 - root to move or turn or play music
05:41 - uh in the center here we have this
05:43 - there's a hole right there this is where
05:44 - we can put in a marker because our robot
05:46 - can draw
05:48 - so you can put a marker in there you can
05:50 - make root blow up on the lights here
05:52 - there's bump sensors in the front so as
05:55 - i'm driving my robot it bumps into
05:57 - something i can code it to move around
05:58 - maybe navigate an obstacle course
06:01 - and on the bottom of our robot there's
06:02 - also more sensors like our cliff sensor
06:05 - here this is great it'll detect an edge
06:07 - if i'm driving on my desktop i don't
06:09 - want my robot to fall off so it's going
06:11 - to stop when it sees an edge when
06:13 - there's nothing below it
06:14 - there's a color sensor here so it can
06:16 - see four different colors
06:18 - and i think the coolest part about a
06:19 - robot is that it's magnetic so i can go
06:22 - up on a whiteboard and drive around and
06:24 - draw whatever i wanted to
06:26 - play music or really whatever i want as
06:30 - long as i can do it with code
06:32 - wow yeah
06:34 - yeah so i get to design cool projects
06:36 - like
06:37 - coding pizza slices and having people
06:40 - eat this eat the pizza or
06:42 - playing lots of other fun games too
06:46 - so um
06:47 - you know
06:48 - i robot uh obviously is a company that
06:51 - creates robots and ava was talking about
06:53 - the roomba i believe right yeah um what
06:57 - else and and there's this uh robot
07:01 - how do you spell the name root
07:03 - r-o-o-t okay yeah um
07:07 - what what
07:08 - what
07:09 - like in a you know what's a brief
07:12 - summary of what irobot does like is it
07:14 - just about making those two robots is it
07:17 - just
07:18 - about making robots that work around the
07:19 - house like
07:20 - what does i wrote what is irobot all
07:22 - about yeah that's a great question pat
07:25 - um ava chime in but i robot so ava was
07:29 - talking about our roomba robot so we
07:30 - have a lot of robots that help out
07:32 - around your home so we have a vacuuming
07:34 - robot we have a mopping robot if you
07:37 - spill something so irobot is a company
07:39 - that's really dedicated to building
07:42 - robots that are going to help you in
07:44 - your life wherever you are at home
07:47 - or at school
07:48 - so we're not just about vacuuming and
07:50 - mopping we also care a lot about what
07:52 - you're learning in your classrooms
07:54 - and i know ava can talk a little bit
07:55 - about our stem outreach program and how
07:58 - we go into classrooms just like this
08:01 - but really help make those connections
08:02 - between what you're learning in school
08:04 - and your math classes to what we're
08:06 - doing
08:07 - at a big tech company like irobot
08:10 - and ava about that roomba and the poop
08:12 - detection
08:14 - how you know a class wants to know
08:17 - a fifth grade class wants to know how
08:18 - long did it take to program the robot to
08:21 - find
08:22 - the poop and do you have some pictures
08:24 - for us
08:27 - uh i don't know i think has a
08:30 - a slide with some pictures but
08:32 - that's a great question it took
08:35 - it took a long time but what's more
08:38 - impressive i would say like it took a
08:40 - year or so but
08:41 - what's more impressive is it took a lot
08:43 - of people working on it together with
08:46 - different skill sets
08:48 - um
08:49 - so i got to work with one of my really
08:51 - cool colleagues and she is a machine
08:54 - learning guru so her team was in charge
08:57 - of getting the pictures and figuring out
08:59 - what is poop what's not poop um
09:03 - what the robot can run over what it
09:04 - can't run over
09:06 - um
09:07 - and then my team was in charge of kind
09:10 - of helping her um
09:11 - [Music]
09:12 - process those images and upload them so
09:15 - they can see the the the images in order
09:18 - to make these decisions at in a fast
09:21 - enough time where the robot can react
09:23 - um so that's just an example but it took
09:25 - a lot a huge
09:27 - it was a huge effort it took a lot of
09:29 - people a lot of different skill sets to
09:30 - work together and even that it took a
09:32 - year to deliver this
09:34 - got it wow
09:36 - um and so that was a question that was
09:38 - asked us by southside elementary
09:40 - actually hi southside elementary um
09:43 - so if anyone else out there has
09:45 - questions please put them in the q a and
09:47 - we'll we'll definitely um ask our
09:49 - panelists those questions uh moving on
09:51 - though
09:53 - uh
09:55 - what's awesome
09:56 - about your job
09:59 - uh we'll start with anna what's awesome
10:00 - about your job anna
10:02 - my job is really cool and really fun um
10:06 - i
10:07 - get to work with an incredible group of
10:09 - people i have to shout out my team we
10:12 - have a really small team if any of you
10:13 - have worked on a group project before or
10:15 - worked in maybe a station or a center in
10:18 - your classroom
10:19 - this is kind of like
10:20 - what working on a team is like you're
10:22 - with all of these really cool people who
10:24 - happen to be your friends who are
10:25 - brilliant and come up with these amazing
10:27 - ideas that you say
10:30 - okay let's try it so one idea that our
10:33 - team came up with was
10:35 - building with lego maybe a lot of you
10:37 - like to build with these kind of bricks
10:38 - like this little dinosaur that my niece
10:41 - built me
10:43 - or we have a little space shuttle like
10:45 - this how many of you like to build with
10:46 - legos
10:47 - raise your hand guys yeah right let me
10:49 - see i like to build legos awesome
10:52 - so our team also likes to do that and
10:54 - we're all like big kids so we designed
10:57 - this piece that goes on top of our robot
11:00 - like this so now we can start building
11:02 - on top and start building things like
11:04 - mechanical arms and uh like dinosaurs
11:08 - and
11:09 - catapults and we get to have these
11:11 - really fun
11:12 - ways that we call we call them play
11:14 - testing in our office so we want to make
11:15 - sure that there's
11:16 - they're
11:17 - fun for everybody and not just fun for
11:19 - us so when we launch them to your
11:20 - classroom we've already tested them
11:22 - inside so
11:24 - our team is really awesome and super fun
11:26 - to work with and they inspire me every
11:28 - day so it's really cool to be able to
11:30 - think of an idea and then make that
11:32 - happen
11:33 - wow
11:34 - that's so interesting that
11:36 - someone could have a job where they're
11:37 - creating activities learning activities
11:41 - like school activities kids but they're
11:43 - super fun and engaging and then they get
11:45 - to spread those activities and that
11:47 - equipment all throughout the world
11:49 - that's so cool
11:50 - ava what about you what's what's awesome
11:52 - about your job
11:54 - uh i think the first part is i get to
11:56 - work with anna because anna's awesome
12:00 - and she's one of my best friends before
12:02 - she worked at a robot
12:03 - um
12:05 - the next thing that's like awesome about
12:07 - my job is i get to build robots and see
12:11 - all the different
12:12 - teams and all the different types of
12:14 - engineering and all the different
12:15 - thoughts that it takes to build these
12:17 - robots
12:19 - not only that i get to build robots that
12:21 - help
12:22 - clean your home so people have more time
12:24 - to do the things that they like to do
12:26 - like play video games
12:28 - or watch anime or
12:31 - you know those are things i enjoy
12:34 - so
12:34 - i think that's the best part about my
12:36 - job yeah ava when did you start working
12:39 - at irobot
12:41 - um i started as an engineer about three
12:44 - years ago in 2018 and
12:47 - i started this new role probably six
12:49 - months ago okay and that new role again
12:52 - is
12:53 - uh director of software engineering
12:55 - director of software engineering all
12:56 - right that's what a director of software
12:58 - engineering does and anna how long have
13:01 - you been working with irobot yeah i
13:03 - joined our team in 2019 so just over two
13:06 - years uh
13:07 - just my two year anniversary a few weeks
13:09 - ago and and you were teaching before
13:11 - that right yeah i was teaching and also
13:14 - working on a maker space which is how i
13:15 - met ava uh we were trying to design a
13:19 - cool stem robotics program and i had no
13:22 - idea where to start and then i
13:25 - coincidentally just met ava and she was
13:27 - like hey i'm looking for something cool
13:28 - to do i love working with kids and i'm
13:31 - brilliant and i have all these awesome
13:33 - skills and so she helped us build this
13:35 - really awesome robotics program
13:38 - okay cool
13:39 - you know we have some questions in the
13:41 - chat so i'm gonna actually take a couple
13:42 - more of these questions
13:44 - um
13:45 - what is your
13:46 - favorite thing to code to code
13:50 - what is your favorite thing to code
13:54 - and either of you can answer this
13:55 - question
13:57 - that's a great question
14:00 - for me it's
14:03 - it's um
14:04 - how i can get different devices to
14:07 - communicate with another device
14:09 - so i like coding um the software
14:12 - the program that will allow that
14:14 - communication
14:16 - so if i want the robot to say hey i'm
14:18 - stuck
14:19 - i like to
14:21 - be able to code so the robot can
14:24 - take that message and send it to your
14:26 - phone or send it to
14:28 - somewhere that you can see it yeah
14:31 - oh that's really uh yeah i i don't have
14:34 - a roomba yet
14:35 - um
14:36 - but uh that's an important feature right
14:39 - if it is stuck to let someone know to
14:42 - get it unstuck rather than just just
14:44 - staying there
14:45 - yeah anna what about you what's your
14:47 - favorite thing to code
14:48 - yeah can i share real quick i have a
14:50 - couple favorite projects um
14:53 - that i've loved to be able to to create
14:55 - and contribute to so one is uh we talked
14:58 - earlier about coding slices of pizza how
15:00 - many of you like pizza
15:02 - i love pizza yeah okay yes i know i love
15:06 - pizza but we could create this with code
15:09 - so one of my teammates coded the slice
15:10 - of pizza and then we have to code how to
15:13 - eat that slice of pizza right so you can
15:15 - do really fun things with code as well
15:18 - like also creating something for a
15:20 - friend like a card that you've coded and
15:23 - you can code it in a simulator and then
15:25 - take a screenshot of that print it out
15:26 - and give it to someone that you care
15:27 - about to express kind of how you're
15:29 - feeling right so code is used for
15:30 - self-expression and being able to share
15:33 - those feelings with the people that you
15:34 - care about
15:35 - and then we also have this really cool
15:37 - game that one of our teammates designed
15:39 - and it was a group project but it's all
15:41 - about mini golf and so it teaches you
15:43 - how to code but in this gamified fun way
15:46 - so that you can learn to do these basics
15:48 - and then you can be able to do things
15:50 - like
15:51 - like ava and she's helping mentor people
15:52 - in her director role people who are
15:55 - learning how to code always i think
15:56 - that's the most important thing is that
15:58 - we're always learning and always trying
16:00 - to get better at what we do so we can
16:02 - help other people
16:04 - any any robots
16:06 - that you all are working on right now
16:08 - that you can talk about
16:10 - or any new robots planned at irobot
16:15 - there's always we're always working on
16:17 - something
16:19 - um there's not much i can share but as
16:21 - as a robotics company you can imagine
16:24 - we're always working on something um
16:26 - using our brains to figure out what
16:28 - other cool things we can introduce okay
16:30 - and and
16:31 - uh
16:32 - is it mainly around the home is that is
16:35 - that what where you guys kind of like
16:38 - uh
16:39 - do you mainly work on robots that work
16:41 - in the home or do you work on robots
16:44 - outside the home as well
16:46 - um
16:47 - so for the most part we mainly work on
16:49 - robots around the home um yeah
16:52 - cool um and we can share one of the
16:55 - educational robots actually just was
16:57 - announced um
16:59 - wednesday so two days ago so this is
17:01 - like hot information for everybody um
17:04 - it's one of our advanced robots so once
17:06 - you get really good at coding with our
17:09 - root robot then you can get more
17:12 - advanced with something called create
17:13 - three
17:15 - and it's gonna be out officially in
17:17 - april so we were just letting people
17:18 - know that they can start helping us test
17:21 - um so we're looking for people who have
17:23 - a lot of experience with robotics
17:25 - because it's one that will help you grow
17:27 - right um and so we just released that
17:30 - information but coming back to what ava
17:31 - was talking about in the beginning about
17:32 - how long it takes to build a robot this
17:35 - robot we're we're looking for people to
17:37 - give us information to let us know okay
17:39 - what works for you and what can we do
17:41 - better and then we do something called
17:43 - iterate uh maybe some of you know this
17:46 - when you're
17:47 - when you're writing an essay right or
17:49 - working on something in class uh like a
17:51 - paragraph or a sentence and you have to
17:53 - edit it and someone next to you maybe
17:55 - your your best friend is like hey i
17:57 - think you can do better i think you
17:58 - could say this in a different way and
17:59 - you scratch it out and correct it and
18:02 - and start to really make it the best
18:04 - work that you possibly can put out
18:06 - that's what we try to do with our robots
18:08 - all the time we're always trying to make
18:09 - them better for the people that are
18:11 - using them
18:12 - yeah iteration super important i think
18:14 - that's probably my favorite part of
18:15 - coding actually iterating and debugging
18:18 - um
18:19 - and making something more efficient
18:22 - um
18:23 - what have you um
18:25 - uh i know you all are very interesting
18:28 - people
18:29 - and uh one of the great things about
18:31 - having a job like yours is that it
18:33 - allows you to pursue certain passions
18:35 - right
18:36 - um so what do you do
18:39 - outside of work let's start with ava
18:41 - what do you do outside of work
18:43 - well a passion of mine is collecting
18:45 - sneakers
18:46 - [Laughter]
18:49 - out there wow we have the director of
18:51 - software engineering at irobot
18:53 - who's a sneaker head look at that
18:57 - all right ava
18:58 - show-and-tell
19:01 - whoa
19:02 - whoa
19:04 - that probably fits some of you all too
19:07 - it definitely does but this is like one
19:10 - of my favorite pairs it's the jordan one
19:13 - um i have a few pairs of the jordan ones
19:16 - but this color is my favorite just
19:17 - because it's so vibrant and out there
19:20 - and bam

19:39 - older brother had them um and i couldn't
19:42 - get them yet so
19:44 - as soon as now that i'm an adult
19:46 - still wearing kid sizes but an adult
19:49 - um
19:50 - i i had to buy them and i love the
19:52 - colors on them so this is my other
19:54 - favorite
19:57 - my third favorite is the jordan 5

20:04 - favorite because it was a collaboration

20:29 - head at heart there are some kids some
20:31 - some teachers are trying to
20:33 - uh calm some kids down right now because
20:35 - they're probably deciding they're
20:36 - looking at those shoes and thinking oh i
20:38 - want that i want that and kids yeah when
20:40 - you when i mean when you get a good job
20:43 - you're it's not just about the job as
20:45 - well as about the the life that you can
20:48 - um live um i know a lot of people um who
20:51 - like to travel a lot um and uh you know
20:54 - that getting a job in technology allows
20:57 - them to do pursue those types of
20:58 - passions and what about you what
21:00 - passions you have yeah um
21:03 - i love to make art so i love to make art
21:06 - with people with people i don't know

21:14 - just invite folks to come over and and
21:16 - draw or or collage dabble whatever you
21:19 - need to do
21:21 - um i always carry

22:05 - all my life yeah you've been doing these
22:07 - things like art and making things all
22:09 - your life yeah i have

22:18 - i have a piece of art here um that my
22:22 - mom has saved
22:24 - um let's see
22:26 - so get ready everybody
22:28 - how old were you
22:30 - um
22:32 - so i was probably i don't know maybe i
22:34 - was in first grade or second grade
22:37 - obviously that is my best creation it is
22:40 - a rainbow unicorn for those of you who
22:42 - cannot obviously detect what i've
22:43 - created
22:44 - um and that's my signature it looks a
22:47 - little different now but um i always as
22:49 - an artist i was always encouraged make
22:51 - sure you sign your name on your work and
22:53 - be proud of what you've done um so this
22:55 - is this is i loved rainbows and i loved
22:58 - color i just loved expressing myself and
23:01 - finding different ways obviously you can
23:02 - see the second picture that is also me
23:05 - dressed up as i would
23:07 - in any kind of print or pattern that i
23:10 - found in my closet uh and also i
23:13 - wanted curly hair forever and ever so i
23:15 - would put rollers in my hair and
23:18 - oh my goodness i don't wild times
23:21 - so but i always found ways to just try
23:23 - to be me and be myself authentically
23:25 - whatever that looked like
23:27 - um and then i always loved trying new
23:29 - things so this is me eva i think you
23:31 - also love basketball uh and we've played
23:34 - basketball quite a few times but this is
23:36 - my first attempt at basketball once upon
23:38 - a time or soccer or gymnastics we're not
23:41 - really sure what was going on there but
23:43 - um
23:44 - yeah
23:45 - probably karate um but yeah i've just
23:48 - i've always been interested in in
23:50 - pushing myself and trying new things and
23:52 - you know just always trying to learn
23:54 - wherever i can um in any capacity so
23:58 - i was pretty
23:59 - pretty adventurous as a kid so ava what
24:02 - were you like as a kid
24:04 - um
24:06 - so i'll say this part in in spanish a
24:08 - little bit uh jonas republica dominicana
24:13 - um
24:16 - familiar
24:32 - when i was a child what i said there was
24:34 - i was born in the dominican republic and
24:36 - i and i came here to the us when i was
24:38 - about four and and i was raised in
24:40 - lawrence massachusetts which is
24:42 - mostly a city
24:43 - of immigrants so i was able to be raised
24:46 - around my culture and continue to
24:48 - participate in my culture
24:50 - which was a huge part of
24:52 - me growing up
24:54 - i grew up very family oriented always
24:56 - around family
24:58 - but as a child i was very
25:01 - sporty i played a lot of sports with my
25:04 - two older brothers so basketball
25:05 - baseball softball football
25:08 - um and i also practice karate
25:11 - and it has pictures in my chair
25:15 - [Music]
25:21 - so yeah i think as a child i i tapped
25:23 - into kind of the competitive side and
25:25 - the sport side which taught me a lot
25:26 - about teamwork uh collaboration
25:31 - competition working hard um
25:34 - and discipline and from my mom and my
25:37 - dad's side my dad's a painter and my
25:39 - mom's a writer so i also tried to paint
25:42 - and write to kind of follow in their
25:44 - footsteps um
25:46 - so i was just a ball of like
25:48 - i would say sportiness and creativity
25:53 - and also like a casual black belt like
25:58 - what these are fun things that you learn
26:00 - about your friends i'm sure all of you
26:02 - have learned different things that
26:03 - fun facts that surprise you about the
26:05 - people that you know so well
26:07 - but that was one thing that i didn't
26:08 - know about ava the other part on here is
26:11 - look at that last picture and how big
26:13 - that trophy is like
26:15 - that's huge so we were thinking do you
26:18 - think that trophy is bigger than baby
26:20 - eva or is ava bigger than the trophy
26:24 - what do you think what do you guys think
26:26 - huh
26:28 - all right well let's take a peek
26:30 - oh that's we get we have a picture oh
26:32 - look at that look at that so actually
26:35 - after doing some math here we're putting
26:37 - some hard math skills to the test
26:38 - everybody that trophy
26:41 - is actually smaller than ava but only by
26:44 - a few inches how
26:46 - wild
26:49 - so that's baby ava
26:50 - yeah so so kids look you get to um at i
26:53 - robot obviously people get to work with
26:56 - their friends and create exciting things
26:59 - uh eva uh and unfortunately we're at the
27:02 - end here and i just wanted to give you
27:03 - uh one last chance to share something
27:05 - with the kids that might motivate them
27:08 - to pursue
27:09 - a job like yours as a learning designer
27:12 - at a technology company or as a director
27:14 - of software engineering or just a
27:15 - software engineer in general like what
27:17 - what would you want to share with our
27:19 - students so that they might consider
27:22 - following in your footsteps
27:25 - sure i can go first um
27:29 - i want to share that
27:31 - coding enables you to build a lot of
27:33 - cool things it doesn't have to be
27:34 - robotics
27:36 - you can build websites you can build
27:38 - games it's kind of endless what you can
27:40 - do with coding
27:43 - but it is hard i i struggled in college
27:46 - it didn't come easy i
27:48 - um pat and i were joking before that i
27:51 - would cry sometimes when i would get
27:53 - homework i would get stuck
27:55 - um and i had
27:57 - people to help me along the way
27:59 - my brother misael helped me it's
28:03 - as long as you have a support system um
28:06 - you can get through it
28:07 - and your support system can be a teacher
28:09 - it can be anyone but just know that it
28:11 - is hard and you have to be resilient
28:14 - but just don't give up because it's hard
28:16 - um you'll be able to create a lot of
28:18 - awesome things and you all have
28:20 - something to contribute and great ideas
28:22 - i'm sure so
28:24 - um
28:24 - i can't wait to see what the future
28:26 - looks like when you're all coding
28:28 - drones and different robots and
28:30 - different things to do
28:31 - um
28:32 - so yeah that's that's kind of what i
28:34 - want to say yes 100 yes
28:37 - um i want to second all of that and then
28:40 - just add in
28:42 - when you're curious about something
28:44 - follow that
28:46 - that thought or whatever it is that's
28:48 - that's peaking your interest
28:51 - i would never have imagined myself here
28:54 - in this job i didn't know what i wanted
28:56 - to be and i always thought i have to
28:57 - have a plan i have to have a plan i have
28:59 - to be
29:00 - this or i have to be this and really you
29:02 - can be so many things there's not one
29:04 - path your path is going to take you on
29:06 - lots of different twists and turns and
29:08 - ups and downs just like ava's talking
29:10 - about sometimes you're going to cry and
29:12 - sometimes you're going to be so excited
29:14 - but as long as you're learning something
29:15 - along the way i think that you are again
29:18 - like eva said you're going to do great
29:19 - things and we are so we don't even know
29:22 - what you're all possible what's going to
29:24 - be happening in the next 5 10 15 years
29:26 - you're going to be creating those things
29:28 - so
29:29 - stay passionate and stay curious
29:31 - yes all right kids uh thank you again
