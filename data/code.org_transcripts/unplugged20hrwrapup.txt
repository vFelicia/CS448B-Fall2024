00:09 - So now it's time to step back and take a birds
eye view of everything you've done in these
00:13 - past nineteen lessons.
00:15 - This is a great time to call out to students
that what they've just done is a huge achievement.
00:20 - They've learned more over these lessons than
most adults know about computer science.
00:26 - Discuss as a class or in small groups about
their favorite lessons.
00:30 - Once you take a look back at everything you've
learned, this is where your students' creativity
00:34 - can shine.
00:36 - Split them into groups and have them create
an unplugged lesson of their own.
00:40 - Assign each group a key concept, like functions
or algorithms and have lots of craft materials
00:45 - on hand for them to use.
00:48 - Have each group present their new unplugged
activity or even set aside another day to
00:52 - do a few of the student created activities.
00:56 - From everyone here at Code.org, we hope you've
had a TON of fun during this course.
01:01 - And whether your dream is to create the best
new app, use programming to help cure diseases,
01:06 - or you just want to be a stellar problem-solver,
this course was the first step in achieving
01:11 - those dreams.
