00:10 - here is our 2d array
00:12 - to access a row start by listing the
00:14 - name of the array followed by a set of
00:16 - square brackets with an index
00:18 - for example
00:20 - cindy's quiz scores are located at index
00:22 - 2 of the outer array
00:24 - to get her answers to the quiz we simply
00:27 - type quiz course
00:28 - brackets 2.
00:30 - if we want to access an individual
00:32 - answer on cindy's quiz we add a second
00:35 - set of square brackets and include the
00:37 - index that corresponds to the answer we
00:40 - want to check
00:41 - so
00:42 - quiz scores brackets 2 bracket 0
00:46 - represents cindy's answer to the first
00:48 - question on the quiz
00:51 - to modify an element we use the same
00:53 - notation but this time we add the
00:55 - assignment operator in the new updated
00:58 - value
00:59 - let's change daniel's third answer
01:02 - first we type quiz course
01:04 - brackets three
01:06 - brackets two
01:07 - that takes us to the fourth row and
01:09 - third column
01:11 - then type gets value c
01:14 - this will change his third answer from d
01:16 - to c
01:17 - be very careful with indexing and make
01:19 - sure to always start counting at zero
01:22 - for both the row and the column
01:25 - accessing and modifying elements in a 2d
01:27 - array is very similar to working with a
01:29 - 1d array
01:31 - we can even implement the same
01:33 - algorithms to work with 2d arrays
