00:05 - Parents, administrators, politicians...
00:07 - everyone is talking about how important Computer Science is.
00:10 - In the new economy, computer science isn't an optional skill,
00:14 - it's a basic skill.
00:16 - You know, computer science is all around us so why not expose our students to it?
00:20 - CS Principles is an AP course that is an introduction to computer science.
00:25 - This is designed to be broadly appealing and accessible
00:28 - and part of that means breaking down
00:30 - stereotypes about what it means to be a
00:32 - computer scientist and what it means to
00:34 - be computer science.
00:37 - Our CS Principles course also has been designed for
00:40 - teachers who don't have any background
00:42 - in teaching computer science.
00:44 - I didn't have much background and
00:45 - I went 'let's try it' and found out I loved it.
00:48 - It's accessible to everybody and that's the coolest thing.
00:51 - Anyone can take the curriculum and be successful.
00:54 - The curriculum itself has a lot of supports
00:56 - built-in but then we have an entire
00:57 - professional learning program that sits
00:59 - on top of that curriculum designed to
01:02 - make the content more approachable and
01:03 - accessible to teachers of various backgrounds.
01:09 - Teaching the curriculum after the PD
01:11 - has been really easy to implement because we were prepared.
01:14 - They make it so that you can
01:16 - understand the material and they make it
01:19 - so you want to come back.
01:20 - It felt very comfortable after the PD teaching this
01:23 - curriculum because everything I need is provided.
01:30 - If you commit to teaching this course you're committing to a five-day
01:33 - summer kickoff experience where you'll
01:35 - come together with other teachers who
01:37 - are just starting the program, as well as
01:39 - 4 ongoing support workshops and those
01:42 - are opportunities for you to get back
01:43 - together with those folks you were
01:45 - working with over the summer and to see what's
01:47 - coming up in the curriculum.
01:49 - We share our ideas. We share our lessons.
01:53 - We share our thoughts on how the lessons are going.
02:00 - And this can help you to teach your
02:02 - activities and your lessons better to your kids.
02:08 - Students can leave this course and start
02:10 - doing real stuff in the world immediately.
02:13 - In years from now when
02:15 - students have had opportunities to take
02:17 - courses like CS Principles,
02:19 - it's going to be a different landscape.
