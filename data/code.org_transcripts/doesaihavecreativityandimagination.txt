00:10 - CEO and co-founder of Runway a company
00:13 - creating AI tools for video generation
00:15 - and storytelling one of our most recent
00:17 - AI tools is an algorithm called gen 2.
00:20 - it allows you to turn texts just
00:23 - language into video
00:25 - I'm Mira murati I'm the chief technology
00:28 - officer at open AI the company that
00:31 - created chat GPT
00:33 - computers were first invented to do math
00:36 - and solve hard problems and despite all
00:39 - the advances in computer science most
00:42 - people assume that computers can never
00:44 - have creativity and Imagination
00:47 - but is that still true AI systems can
00:50 - not only write stories they can create
00:52 - images that no one has ever seen before
00:56 - AI is able to create award-winning art
00:58 - like this
01:00 - it can create social media influencers
01:03 - that don't exist in real life and even
01:05 - create complete video sequences
01:08 - just a few words of instruction
01:11 - but how does this AI work and does it
01:14 - have true creativity and Imagination
01:17 - let's dig in
01:19 - early projects that taught AI to create
01:22 - art used something called a generative
01:24 - adversarial neural network which is a
01:27 - way of using 2A models to generate
01:29 - images the way this works is that one Ai
01:32 - call a generator
01:33 - [Music]
01:34 - trying to create images that are similar
01:37 - to the ones in the training set
01:41 - a different adversarial AI
01:45 - trains to the attack if those images are
01:47 - close to the originals or not
01:50 - [Music]
01:52 - both AIS train against each other until
01:55 - the adversarial can no longer detect
01:57 - what image is real
02:01 - and what image was created artificially
02:06 - at this point the generative AI has
02:08 - learned to generate real looking imagery
02:11 - now this is great but computer
02:13 - scientists have come up with something
02:16 - even better called diffusion
02:19 - inspired by physics diffusion involves
02:22 - converting an image to an unrecognizable
02:25 - blur or noise and training an AI to
02:29 - reverse this process take for example
02:31 - this image with all of its detail
02:36 - we can introduce a little bit of
02:38 - Randomness or noise to these pixels
02:41 - which takes away some of the detail
02:44 - if you repeat this gradually one
02:47 - thousand times the image loses all
02:50 - details and becomes Pure Noise
02:54 - now every step of this gradual
02:56 - transition is an opportunity to train AI
02:59 - to learn to reverse the process an AI
03:03 - neural network can train by looking at a
03:06 - noisy image and then try to generate the
03:09 - slightly less noisy version
03:11 - because the noisy version of the image
03:13 - doesn't have all the details the AI is
03:17 - learning to guess what the higher
03:19 - resolution details should be and that's
03:22 - how it creates new images
03:24 - now to train an AI we repeat this with
03:27 - millions and millions of images each of
03:29 - them labeled with their descriptions
03:32 - if we do this enough times bi learns to
03:35 - take a text description and generate
03:38 - completely new images nobody has ever
03:40 - seen before
03:42 - or to alter existing images
03:46 - the same approach can also be used for
03:48 - videos
03:52 - now this raises multiple questions is
03:55 - the AI really learning creativity and
03:57 - Imagination on the one hand if you look
04:01 - at art and video created by AI it can be
04:03 - beautiful original and amazing
04:07 - on the other hand the AI only learns
04:10 - this by doing math at the pixel level
04:12 - while studying creations made by people
04:16 - is that really creativity another
04:18 - question is the issue of copyright AI
04:21 - learns by studying the creations of
04:23 - others and the original creators may
04:26 - want to say in this of course when
04:28 - humans learn to create they also study
04:31 - creations made by others so the legal
04:34 - questions here are not simple
04:37 - we're still in the very early days of
04:39 - teaching AI how to create new types of
04:41 - media
04:42 - today AI can generate photos and videos
04:45 - soon you would also learn to create
04:48 - music
04:50 - and 3D worlds this will have an
04:54 - incredible impact on all aspects of
04:56 - society especially in entertainment not
04:59 - just movies and music but also games we
05:03 - hope you learn more about how AI works
05:05 - and how to use it for your own creations
05:08 - what will you create
