00:01 - What do you want to be when you grow up Olivia?
00:09 - Umm, an astronaut!
00:10 - Do you happen to know what a computer programmer
is?
00:13 - Yeahh, umm, no.
00:14 - Umm, what what?
00:16 - I'm not really sure how to explain it.
00:19 - Computer programming is pretty simple.
00:20 - It's a set of instructions, like a recipe.
00:22 - You have to follow them step by step to get
the end result you want.
00:27 - Computer science is a way to impact the world.
00:31 - It can be music videos, it can be games, detect
whether or not someone is related to someone
00:35 - else.
00:36 - Find you know, people's friends.
00:38 - You can do all sorts of other crazy things
that actually save lives.
00:41 - You do have to have a drive I think.
00:44 - It is to me like a paintbrush.
00:46 - I think great programming is not all that
dissimilar from great art.
00:52 - When I finally learned a little bit of programming,
that blank wall resolved into a bunch of doors
00:58 - and you open them and of course then you find
behind them is another hallway filled with
01:02 - a bunch of doors.
01:04 - Programming is fun and easy.
01:06 - You can do anything your mind wants to do.
01:09 - Finally you start to open enough doors the
light comes in.
01:12 - To me a finished program is like a structure
filled with light.
01:16 - All the corners are illuminated.
01:17 - The number of people that you can touch and
interact with is something the world has never
01:24 - seen before.
01:25 - Our first lesson in this series is all about
what computer science is, what a computer
01:32 - scientist does and how you can be more responsible
in your use of technology.
01:37 - It's a very important lesson but it is a little
text-heavy.
01:40 - At the end, you get to make your very own
customized encoding using your initials.
01:47 - It's a fun activity and it's very empowering
because binary is one of those things that
01:51 - feels very technical but once you understand
it, it's like you speak a secret language.
