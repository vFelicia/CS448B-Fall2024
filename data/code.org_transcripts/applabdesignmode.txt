00:05 - my name is kaylee brock and i'm a
00:08 - software engineering intern here at
00:10 - code.org and i'm currently studying
00:12 - computer science at the university of
00:14 - waterloo
00:15 - anything that we build with technology
00:17 - is to solve a problem for people and so
00:21 - if people
00:22 - don't want to use what you build because
00:25 - it doesn't look good or it's not
00:27 - designed to be able to be easily used
00:30 - then why bother because they're just not
00:31 - going to use it so for me design is
00:34 - always an integral part of every project
00:36 - that i work on
00:39 - the user interface of an app is what we
00:41 - call all the components of an app that a
00:43 - human can interact with
00:45 - laying out and designing what the screen
00:47 - looks like deciding what kinds of things
00:49 - a user can do like click a button enter
00:51 - text swipe to a different screen all of
00:54 - these are aspects of user interface
00:56 - design we've seen you can add elements
00:59 - to your app like buttons text labels and
01:02 - images with javascript code
01:04 - but we've also seen that the process of
01:06 - adding elements to the screen
01:07 - positioning styling them is a bit labor
01:10 - intensive and difficult to see without
01:12 - running the program
01:13 - it also fills up your app with code
01:15 - that's not really related to its core
01:17 - functionality
01:18 - fortunately
01:19 - applab has a feature called design mode
01:22 - a design tool that lets you quickly and
01:24 - easily design your user interface
01:26 - you should know that apps made in app
01:28 - lab are actually web pages whose visual
01:31 - elements are made with html and css that
01:34 - are controlled by javascript
01:36 - html stands for hypertext markup
01:38 - language and tells the browser about the
01:41 - main visual components of the web page
01:44 - css stands for cascading style sheets
01:48 - and can control the styling of these
01:50 - elements like their color position and
01:52 - size the html and css are stored for you
01:56 - behind the scenes by app lab
01:58 - so you can focus on the javascript code
02:00 - which is really the brains of the app
02:03 - whether you're using commands like
02:04 - button set position or dragging and
02:06 - dropping a button in design mode they're
02:09 - both inserting html and css into your
02:11 - app under the hood
02:13 - using design mode helps remove a lot of
02:15 - clutter from your coding workspace
02:17 - allowing you to focus your coding
02:19 - efforts on function rather than design
02:21 - let's see more about how design mode
02:23 - works
02:25 - in app lab you'll see a switch right
02:27 - above the app that switches the toolbox
02:29 - from code toolbox to the design toolbox
02:33 - we call this switching into design mode
02:36 - in design mode you can drag and drop
02:38 - user interface components onto the
02:40 - screen and position them wherever you
02:42 - like
02:43 - you can also easily resize an element on
02:45 - the screen by clicking and dragging the
02:47 - little handle on the bottom right corner
02:50 - on the right side of the screen you'll
02:52 - see the design workspace where you can
02:54 - see all the properties you can set for
02:56 - the selected element
02:58 - like the text of the button position and
03:00 - size values color for the background and
03:02 - text the font size and a few others
03:05 - different elements have different
03:07 - properties you can set
03:10 - once you've got an element on the screen
03:12 - you'll need to make sure you can connect
03:14 - it with your code by setting the
03:15 - elements id
03:17 - when you set an id in design mode if you
03:19 - flip to code mode and drag an on event
03:21 - block you'll see a pull down list of all
03:24 - the element ids you created
03:26 - if you made ids that are descriptive and
03:28 - meaningful it means it is easy to choose
03:30 - the id of the element you want and add
03:33 - code to the event handling function
03:37 - there's also a convenient way from
03:39 - design mode to insert an event handler
03:41 - in your code
03:42 - in the design workspace if you click on
03:44 - the events tab you'll see one or more
03:46 - suggestions for typical events for this
03:48 - kind of element
03:50 - you will see a link that says insert and
03:52 - show code if you click it it'll append
03:54 - an on event command to your code and set
03:56 - the id of the element and event type for
03:59 - you
04:00 - whether you're adding an image element
04:02 - to your app or background images for
04:04 - buttons you can enter the url of the
04:06 - image you want to use
04:08 - if the image is very large you might
04:10 - need to set the width and height numbers
04:12 - so the resize handle fits in the window
04:17 - instead of entering a url of an image
04:19 - you can also click the choose link next
04:21 - to the text box which lets you upload
04:23 - your own image and sound files from your
04:26 - computer to your app when you upload a
04:28 - file it goes into a list of assets
04:31 - you've uploaded so far
04:34 - once it's uploaded you can choose that
04:36 - file
04:37 - lastly you should know the screen itself
04:40 - is an element of your app you can set
04:42 - the background color or background image
04:43 - for the screen
04:45 - the screen also has an id and can
04:47 - respond to events like any other element
04:50 - for example you might want to know when
04:52 - your user clicked on the screen
04:55 - you can also have multiple screens in
04:56 - your app
04:57 - to add a screen you can drag out a
04:59 - screen element or use the pull-down menu
05:02 - just above the design area
05:10 - once you add a screen give it a
05:12 - meaningful id
05:13 - you can use the pull down menu to switch
05:15 - between screens in design mode
05:18 - but how do you write code to control
05:19 - which screen to show
05:21 - you'll see a command and the ui controls
05:24 - code toolbox called set screen
05:26 - set screen will change the app to show
05:28 - the screen specified by the
05:30 - id you give it
05:32 - when you drag the set screen command out
05:34 - into the workspace its id field will
05:36 - show a pull down menu of all the screens
05:38 - you've added to your app
05:40 - now you can change the screen in
05:41 - response to some event
05:44 - using design mode and app lab is your
05:46 - gateway to quickly and easy making nice
05:48 - looking apps
05:49 - you can add elements to your app upload
05:51 - files like images and sounds even add
05:54 - multiple screens
05:56 - [Music]
06:17 - you
