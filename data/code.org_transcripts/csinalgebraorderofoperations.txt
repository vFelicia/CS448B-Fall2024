00:06 - You may have noticed the evaluation block
only has two slots.
00:12 - What if I want to add 1 plus 2 plus 3?
00:16 - Think of each of these slots as an input.
00:19 - Each input on an evaluation block can take
a value, like 1 or 2.
00:24 - But they can also take a whole other evaluation
block.
00:28 - To add 1 plus 2 plus 3, we can drop in an
additional block for 2 plus 3.
00:35 - When the computer evaluates your blocks, it
starts from the inside out, evaluating each
00:41 - nested block before it moves out to the next
level.
00:45 - This brings us to the order of operations.
00:49 - Operations are actions, such as add, subtract,
multiply and divide.
00:55 - If it isn't a number, it probably is an operation.
00:59 - But when you something like 7 plus 6 times
52 plus 3, which parts should you calculate
01:08 - first?
01:09 - Do you start at the left and go to the right?
01:11 - Or start at the right and go to the left?
01:14 - This actually matters because calculating
in the wrong order will get you a wrong answer.
01:19 - There is a specific order of operations that
tells you what to do first and then to do
01:27 - next.
01:28 - We can remember the order with a cool word
called PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication,
01:37 - Division, Addition and Subtraction.
01:42 - Do things in parentheses first: 6 times 5
plus 3 turns into 6 times 8 which equals 48.
01:54 - If we just went left to right and did 6 times
5 and got 30 and then added 3, that would
02:01 - equal 33 which is wrong.
02:04 - After we've done parentheses, we move on to
exponents.
02:08 - In this example, we square the 2 first and
then multiply it by 5 to get 20.
02:16 - Next is M and D for multiply and divide.
02:20 - Anywhere in your expression that has a multiply
or divide sign needs to be done before addition
02:26 - or subtraction.
02:28 - If there is multiply and divide in the same
expression, then just go left to right.
02:33 - Again, PEMDAS stands for: P - Parentheses
first, E - Exponents next, then M, D - Multiplication
02:43 - and Division which is done left to right and
finally A, S - for Addition and Subtraction
02:50 - which is also done left to right.
02:53 - Divide and Multiply rank equally and go left
to right.
02:57 - Add and subtract rank equally as well and
go left to right.
03:02 - You can remember PEMDAS with a few fun phrases
like Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally or Pudgy
03:10 - Elves May Demand A Snack or even Please Eat
Mom's Delicious Apple Strudels.
03:20 - Your computer isn't smart enough to understand
order of operations.
03:25 - You need to show it the order you want operations
to be done in.
03:29 - We can do that by nesting blocks inside of
other blocks.
03:33 - Blocks are evaluated from left to right and
from the inside out.
03:38 - If we wanted to program the expression 8 minus
2 times 5 plus 10 divided by 2 plus 1, we
03:47 - can use PEMDAS to remember the order we should
nest our blocks in.
03:51 - P - there are no parentheses so let's move
on.
03:55 - E - no exponents either.
03:59 - Next Multiplication - M. Ok, so we have some
multiplication.
04:04 - Let's make a block for the 2 times 5.
04:08 - D - there's also some division too.
04:10 - Let's make a block for 10 divided by 2.
04:14 - A, S - we've also got addition and subtraction
here so let's sort it out from left to right.
04:22 - First we can grab a subtraction block and
plug in 8 on the left and our 2 times 5 block
04:29 - on the right.
04:31 - Then we'll grab an addition block, plug in
our whole 8 minus 2 times 5 expression on
04:38 - the left and another addition block on the
right.
04:43 - Then finally we can plug in our 10 divided
by 2 on the left side and 1 on the right.
04:49 - 8 minus 2 times 5 plus 10 divided by 2 plus
1.
04:57 - And that's it!
04:58 - The block version of this mathematical expression.
