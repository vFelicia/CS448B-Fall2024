00:00 - one and thank you for joining us today
00:03 - for a special arab code video chat to
00:05 - celebrate Computer Science Education
00:06 - Week
00:07 - joining us today is jr. hildebrand jr.
00:10 - is an American race car driver that's
00:12 - passionate about technology and computer
00:14 - programming students please join me yeah
00:37 - hey guys I'm excited to be here we're
00:40 - gonna talk a little bit about racing you
00:42 - guys you guys already you know put
00:44 - together some good questions so we're
00:47 - excited to be about it I trust that you
00:48 - guys have all done your hour of code
00:50 - already I know that I have so yeah let's
00:53 - get this party started right well our
00:56 - first question is from Monrovia Middle
00:59 - School in Madison Alabama how is
01:06 - computer science impacted the world of
01:08 - racing computer science is a huge piece
01:12 - of what we do because we collect an
01:14 - incredible amount of data from the race
01:16 - car so the race car goes out on track it
01:19 - has a data box that's connected to it
01:21 - and we collect thousands of different
01:23 - types of different types of data points
01:26 - sampled hundreds of times per second so
01:29 - those of you that are familiar with the
01:31 - size of data and all that kind of stuff
01:33 - we collect almost a gigabyte of data per
01:35 - lap at the racetrack so that's a lot of
01:37 - information that we have to be able to
01:39 - go through and the engineers that work
01:41 - for our teams there's probably five or
01:44 - six full-time engineers that work per
01:47 - car per race team so you figure there's
01:50 - maybe 25 or 30 cars that compete in an
01:54 - IndyCar event at a time you know that's
01:56 - five guys per team and then there's a
01:58 - bunch of engineers that work for the
01:59 - engine manufacturers and all kinds of
02:02 - stuff there's hundreds of engineers that
02:03 - work just within one single series like
02:06 - India or NASCAR or Formula One or
02:08 - whatever and then they have to go build
02:11 - programs to be able to analyze
02:13 - is that data so the computer science
02:16 - element of it is a huge piece of what we
02:18 - do with the racetrack it's a huge piece
02:20 - of how we solve problems and that we do
02:23 - that in a very similar process to how
02:25 - you guys might say look at a science
02:27 - fair project or something like that we
02:29 - have to come up with a hypothesis for
02:30 - what we think is going to happen on the
02:33 - track then we collect the data from the
02:35 - race car we look at that data through
02:37 - our computer software that's all shown
02:40 - in sort of a graphical display much like
02:43 - what you guys would look at while doing
02:46 - the hour of code and then from there we
02:48 - decide to make some adjustments or make
02:51 - changes of the car and go back out and
02:52 - do it all over again so the computer
02:54 - science element of what we do is you
02:56 - know we wouldn't be able to go 230 miles
02:59 - an hour at the Indianapolis Motor
03:00 - Speedway
03:01 - if computer science wasn't as big of an
03:04 - element of how we go fast and how we
03:06 - compete at the track great thank you and
03:10 - our next question comes from me diabolos
03:12 - middle school in media palace Iowa why
03:16 - did you decide to become an advocate for
03:18 - computer science and encouraged students
03:20 - to learn how to code yeah that's a good
03:24 - question
03:25 - I think for me it's just it's such a big
03:27 - piece of what we do you know in in
03:30 - Motorsports we see math and science
03:33 - generally at work in a very real sense
03:36 - every day at the track physics chemistry
03:41 - we're running algorithms constantly to
03:43 - try to figure out how to sort through
03:45 - the different amounts of it or the you
03:46 - know the different type of information
03:48 - that we have and so and I think that
03:50 - that that will only become a bigger and
03:53 - bigger part of a lot of industries that
03:56 - are out there and that frankly they're
03:57 - really cool industries and you look at
03:59 - the space the you know sort of
04:00 - privatized spaceflight and things like
04:03 - that you know computer science is going
04:07 - and that's what's gonna drive those
04:08 - fields and so I think it's important for
04:11 - guys like you you know for for young
04:14 - people like yourselves to see that not
04:17 - only is that a very viable career path
04:20 - down the road but it's a career path
04:22 - that can lead to being involved in
04:24 - things that are totally cutting edge
04:27 - and really cool and fun to be a part of
04:29 - you know getting a computer science
04:31 - degree you'll have sort of limitless
04:35 - boundaries for what you'll be able to do
04:38 - with that I think in five or ten years
04:40 - so it's important I think for you know
04:42 - generally in math and science but
04:44 - definitely in computer science to see
04:46 - that there's really cool stuff that you
04:47 - can do with a computer science degree
04:50 - out there great thank you and our next
04:53 - question comes from Decorah High School
04:55 - in Decorah Iowa what motivated you to do
05:01 - so well in school while pursuing a
05:03 - racing career our job security is pretty
05:08 - lousy in Motorhead Sports kind of
05:10 - generally but I think for me that was
05:13 - just you know when I was growing up I
05:17 - was really focused on my education you
05:19 - know I liked racing and I liked cars and
05:21 - you know I played oh there like I played
05:22 - varsity baseball in high school and
05:24 - maybe kind of other normal stuff you
05:27 - know my education was just always I
05:30 - looked at that as a foundation from
05:32 - which I'd always be able to you know
05:36 - have success from and and I'd say since
05:39 - I've it was sort of fortunate enough to
05:41 - pursue a professional career in sports
05:44 - that focus on education has only helped
05:47 - me further my career doing this so not
05:50 - only is it something that's given me a
05:52 - great platform to work for him should I
05:54 - decide at some point to do something
05:56 - else but it's allowed me to be more
05:59 - successful in doing what I do especially
06:02 - with you know what we do at the
06:03 - racetrack you need to be able to
06:05 - communicate with you know guys that have
06:07 - their PhD in you know you know various
06:13 - physics fields and engineering fields
06:14 - and things like that so you know having
06:17 - that focus and that background for me in
06:19 - education has made having some kind of
06:23 - common vocabulary and you know the
06:25 - ability to discuss things on their level
06:28 - with those guys
06:29 - technically much more straightforward so
06:33 - you know I think it was something that
06:34 - was kind of ingrained in me from look
06:36 - from when I was a little kid to to
06:40 - pursue
06:40 - having success in education but you know
06:43 - it's also ended up being something that
06:45 - I've gone back to and and continued
06:48 - taking some classes here and there and
06:49 - things like that just because I've
06:50 - realized that it helps me even in my
06:53 - profession now great thank you
06:57 - so our next question comes from Acadia
06:58 - junior high in Winnipeg Canada what's
07:02 - your favorite app or game and that's a
07:06 - tough one you know I'd be lying to you
07:09 - if I didn't say that racing games were
07:10 - high on my list but I always kind of
07:14 - liked like puzzle like logic games ideas
07:17 - like maybe more of like a stupid adult
07:20 - thing but like I do that Lumosity do you
07:23 - guys see commercials for online but it's
07:26 - like a bunch of logic games or brain
07:29 - teasers and all that kind of stuff I
07:32 - like stuff that kind of keeps you sharp
07:33 - it makes you work for it but you know
07:35 - having said that there's a bunch of
07:38 - there's a bunch of apps and games that I
07:39 - did have you guys played that 2048 is
07:44 - one that I've gotten addicted to four
07:46 - times two dots there's a few of them I
07:51 - get I get hooked on are pretty easy so
07:54 - eight I'm sorry next question comes from
07:58 - McKinney High School in McKinney Texas
08:08 - jr. if you could have one piece of
08:11 - technology that doesn't exist yet what
08:14 - would it be I don't know you know like I
08:19 - had this guy's wrote this question to me
08:21 - earlier and like I still don't really
08:24 - have a good answer for it you guys have
08:27 - any good ideas
08:28 - let's hear some from the class here
08:32 - you
08:41 - crazy go ahead and unmute yeah yeah okay
08:55 - teleportation teleportation yeah I mean
09:25 - certainly if you look at kind of like
09:27 - global scale yeah you know water
09:30 - purification and things like that are
09:31 - definitely you know we we like to think
09:34 - of those as being like more humanitarian
09:37 - obviously and maybe a little bit less
09:38 - fun I don't know I'd have to I have to
09:43 - think about that a little bit more
09:44 - that's a super good question that was a
09:46 - that was a hard one you know for us I
09:48 - mean I've always been huge on space
09:51 - travel so I think like warp drive stuff
09:54 - like that is it was definitely something
09:57 - that I hope and in our lifetimes that we
09:59 - see some development in you know I don't
10:04 - know yeah that's that's an awesome
10:05 - question good job guys great sorry next
10:08 - question is from hot gap middle school
10:10 - in John's Island South Carolina like
10:23 - like anybody there's a lot of obstacles
10:26 - that you have to overcome I think in any
10:29 - in any pursuit whether that's you know
10:31 - sports or a career path or through your
10:34 - education you know a big piece of it for
10:37 - us you know in in racing you know
10:40 - there's such kind of a small there's a
10:43 - very short list of drivers boys and
10:46 - girls that are capable of you know that
10:49 - really have the skill set to do what we
10:51 - do at
10:52 - I level and win races so you're kind of
10:53 - always up against you know other
10:58 - people's perception of how good you are
11:01 - at different things you know we in
11:04 - racing you're always a part of a team
11:06 - and sometimes that's sometimes that
11:09 - helps your personal performance you know
11:10 - sometimes you can kind of over achieve
11:12 - because the people around you are really
11:14 - good sometimes you you know your results
11:16 - kind of seem to be underachieving
11:19 - because of the people around you and
11:20 - that that's you know that's something
11:23 - that you kind of have to learn to accept
11:25 - about life you know like there are
11:27 - always variables that impact how well
11:30 - you do with things and what other people
11:32 - think about it and so I think for me and
11:35 - for a lot of guys or you know men and
11:37 - women you know Danica Patrick is is
11:40 - someone who's dealt with this you know
11:42 - because she's a female in in bigger ways
11:45 - than most or more frequently than most
11:47 - is you know having to at some point come
11:51 - to the realization that you need to just
11:52 - trust trust yourself and trust your own
11:56 - feelings about your ability to do things
12:00 - you know there's there's a difference
12:02 - between being impatient and being
12:05 - unprepared you know when you're coming
12:07 - into something new or you're trying to
12:09 - kind of climb up the the ladder within
12:12 - you know whatever you're doing is you're
12:14 - going from grade to grade or you know
12:16 - maybe you're gonna start taking some
12:18 - honors or AP classes you know for us you
12:21 - start out racing like little race cars
12:23 - then you get into something faster and
12:26 - faster and faster and then you're on TV
12:27 - and people are paying attention and you
12:29 - know all of a sudden you're trying to
12:31 - you know kind of find it out with the
12:33 - rest of the the hotshot guys that have
12:35 - been doing it and been pro for a long
12:37 - time you know so having to kind of
12:40 - overcome you know all of the other
12:44 - people's opinions about you know how
12:46 - well you can do and how far you can go
12:49 - can be a very if you can achieve that
12:53 - can be a very liberating kind of
12:56 - experience personally you know to to
13:00 - really have that faith in yourself and
13:02 - and know that that matters more than
13:04 - more than anything so
13:06 - I'd say you know particularly in what we
13:08 - do that's a big piece of it great and
13:12 - our last question comes from massage
13:14 - middle school and Asajj Beach Missouri
13:18 - we read that you're accepted to MIT but
13:21 - decided to pursue racing career do you
13:25 - believe that you'll pursue programming
13:27 - in the future
13:30 - yeah I think so it's a you know
13:32 - programming specifically as a part of
13:35 - what is obviously like a much larger you
13:39 - know to me I look at that as a piece of
13:41 - maybe a larger engineering focus that
13:45 - that I already have and I think will
13:48 - continue to have you know I've
13:50 - maintained a strong relationship with
13:52 - MIT
13:53 - you know thankfully for all my you know
13:56 - my parents and high school counselors
13:58 - and stuff not going to call it not going
14:00 - there right out of high school has sort
14:01 - of panned out that I've actually managed
14:03 - to become a professional racecar driver
14:05 - but you know it's definitely a part of
14:08 - what I'm interested in now it's a big
14:10 - piece of what I do as a profession as it
14:12 - is despite the fact that I'm the the guy
14:15 - driving the car and not the one working
14:17 - on it so you know absolutely I mean I I
14:20 - fully intend to get my get my degree and
14:24 - that programming will will absolutely be
14:26 - a piece of that great well thank you jr.
14:31 - for joining us today we so appreciate
14:34 - you spending time answering questions
14:36 - and sharing more with us and inspiring
14:37 - more students to try computer science
14:39 - well students can everyone join me in
14:42 - thanking jr. for his time today
