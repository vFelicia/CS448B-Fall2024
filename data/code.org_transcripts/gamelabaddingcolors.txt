00:07 - So far, you've only been drawing gray
colored shapes.
00:10 - Let's throw some color into these shapes to make them more interesting.
00:13 - Every shape has two elements that can be colored.
00:16 - A stroke and a fill.
00:19 - The stroke is the border of the shape. The fill is the color inside the shape.
00:23 - At any point you can change the color
00:25 - used to draw the stroke or fill of the
shape.
00:28 - For example, here we'll change the fill to be the color green before drawing a rectangle.
00:33 - If you draw more rectangles after setting the fill color, they'll also be green.
00:38 - Until you change the fill color, Game Lab will continue to draw shapes in the color that you set.
00:43 - The same applies for the stroke of your
shapes.
00:50 - If you don't want your shapes to have a stroke or a fill you can use the noStroke() or noFill() commands to make it so.
00:57 - The order of commands matters a lot
in Game Lab.
01:01 - You need to change the color of your stroke or fill before you draw the shape.
01:04 - If you are drawing or painting in real life, this would be like dipping your paintbrush into your palette before drawing on the canvas.
01:10 - There's lots of
other commands you can use to create
01:13 - interesting and complex drawings.
01:16 - As you get more familiar with all the drawing tools available in Game Lab you'll get better bringing your ideas to life.
01:21 - Happy drawing!
