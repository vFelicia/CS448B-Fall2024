00:08 - hi my name is soraya buhanda and i'm a
00:11 - professional learning specialist with
00:12 - code.org i want to thank all the
00:15 - classrooms tuning in for today's my
00:17 - journeys class chat
00:19 - teachers please know we have enabled
00:21 - live closed captioning for all of our
00:23 - class chats
00:24 - i'd like to welcome danny bazzo a
00:26 - creative engineer at meow wolf where he
00:28 - helps to build super cool interactive
00:30 - art
00:31 - i'm excited to talk with danny because
00:33 - i've been to meow wolf both as a parent
00:35 - with my family and as a teacher with my
00:37 - students on a field trip
00:39 - danny is going to share with us his
00:41 - journey from robotics to electronic
00:43 - music to game design that eventually led
00:46 - him to where he is now
00:48 - teachers please know
00:50 - let us know where your classes from and
00:52 - add your students questions for danny in
00:54 - the q a we'll try our best to get to
00:57 - some of those questions during the chat
00:59 - today so danny
01:01 - let's start
01:02 - with a would you rather question
01:05 - the question is
01:07 - would you rather
01:08 - be forced to sing along or dance to
01:11 - every single song you hear
01:14 - i'll go first
01:16 - i think i would rather have to dance to
01:18 - every single song i hear to kind of work
01:21 - it out through dance
01:23 - instead of forced to sing the songs what
01:25 - would you rather danny
01:27 - uh that's a hard one i'm a terrible
01:29 - dancer but i could fake my way through
01:31 - with a little operatic
01:34 - through pretty much anything everything
01:36 - nice
01:38 - all right let's dive right in so what is
01:40 - meow wolf and where does its name come
01:42 - from
01:44 - ah okay so um
01:47 - i'll share some pictures with you here
01:48 - and we'll talk about that um meow wolf
01:51 - is a group of artists who make what are
01:54 - called immersive interactive
01:56 - installations and that's a lot of words
01:58 - to mean a place where a story is sort of
02:01 - happening and i'll start by answering
02:03 - your second question where what does
02:04 - meow wolf mean where did it come from
02:06 - well it's a group of artists and they
02:08 - couldn't agree on the name a long time
02:09 - ago so what did they do they threw
02:12 - random words into a hat and agreed that
02:14 - whatever first two words they picked out
02:16 - of the hat would be the name of the
02:18 - group and that's how we became mao wolfe
02:20 - a long time ago and so what is meow wolf
02:23 - well i'll show you a video about one of
02:25 - our stories um from our installation in
02:29 - las vegas and this is a story in las
02:31 - vegas about a grocery store uh with
02:34 - maybe a twist
02:38 - [Music]
02:43 - [Music]
03:12 - so meowth is a place where a story is
03:14 - happening and by interacting with um a
03:18 - big almost sort of movie set um you take
03:21 - part in the story too
03:24 - that is so awesome before we go on jenny
03:26 - i do want to acknowledge some of the
03:28 - classrooms so we have san diego elk
03:31 - grove california thurman middle school
03:34 - in frederick maryland north dakota 4th
03:37 - graders from carson city nevada
03:39 - a csd class from sacramento california
03:42 - and one class that did respond to the
03:44 - would you rather half the class would
03:45 - like to sing and half of the class would
03:47 - like to dance
03:49 - so now danny what does a creative
03:51 - engineer do
03:53 - oh well that's a good question so um
03:56 - i'll show you some pictures about that
03:58 - too about what we do at meow wolf so
04:02 - [Music]
04:04 - um
04:06 - some of our
04:07 - places in the installations have
04:09 - interactive things like this for example
04:11 - on the left is a huge skeleton that you
04:14 - could play like a xylophone you hit it
04:16 - with a mallet and each rib makes a
04:17 - different noise and makes a different
04:18 - sound happen um on the right is a set of
04:21 - mushrooms in the forest where if you
04:23 - sort of bop them they make a different
04:24 - sound and
04:26 - play some lighting animation as well so
04:29 - i work on the team that is behind the
04:32 - scenes for those kinds of elements doing
04:34 - the wiring the code and the electronics
04:37 - that makes all that interactive stuff uh
04:39 - happen
04:42 - really cool also quick shout out to
04:44 - those uh students in pittsburgh
04:46 - pennsylvania so how did you decide to
04:48 - become a creative engineer
04:51 - well um
04:52 - i've always had an interest in art and
04:55 - in
04:56 - making things whether it's electronics
04:58 - or whether it's code or mechanical stuff
05:02 - when i was young i played with legos
05:04 - basically all day especially the technic
05:06 - legos that allowed you to use gears and
05:08 - mechanisms i did that all the time
05:10 - but i also was kind of drawing and
05:12 - painting and trying to figure out a way
05:14 - to put all this stuff together um when i
05:16 - was young the creative engineering at
05:18 - meow sort of didn't exist and the next
05:20 - closest thing was like movie special
05:22 - effects i love movie special effects so
05:24 - i thought i would be a movie special
05:25 - effects person um
05:27 - and in fact uh if you want to hear about
05:30 - the
05:31 - training that i did i could show you
05:32 - some pictures that kind of led me along
05:34 - this
05:35 - this path here
05:37 - yeah sure
05:39 - oops
05:40 - oh yeah i left out some of the uh other
05:43 - things that we do as creative engineers
05:44 - is write a lot of code and some some of
05:46 - you who code yourselves might recognize
05:48 - on the left the processing language
05:51 - uh that we use a lot at now
05:53 - so
05:54 - um
05:55 - i got my start oops
05:58 - um
06:00 - going through school so here's some
06:01 - robots that i worked at worked on
06:04 - through the various schools that i've
06:05 - gone to on the left is a is a underwater
06:08 - robot that i worked at
06:10 - shout out to san diego at san diego
06:13 - community college
06:14 - on the right here is some roombas that i
06:16 - programmed with
06:18 - uh that that i programmed to do some uh
06:21 - chase games with
06:23 - and on the middle here is a set of
06:25 - robotic cameras
06:27 - let me see if i could find a picture of
06:29 - one
06:30 - that i
06:32 - worked with at university so most of my
06:34 - training was done through school i ended
06:36 - up going to school for uh engineering
06:38 - and robotics
06:40 - that's so cool so walk us through your
06:42 - thought process for thinking about and
06:44 - creating art from devices and
06:47 - electronics
06:49 - well um to me as an electronic artist um
06:53 - i treat circuits and code almost like my
06:55 - paint brushes when i have an idea for a
06:57 - creative work or at meowth when someone
06:59 - else has an idea for creative work i
07:01 - think of ways to
07:03 - make that happen using the paint brushes
07:05 - and tools that i have so
07:07 - what kind of circuits would help me
07:09 - do what people want what kind of sensors
07:11 - or what kind of motors and actuators
07:13 - would help us get the animations we want
07:15 - um so i started there with the creative
07:17 - idea and kind of worked my way over
07:20 - into what technology would work best
07:24 - cool so what other i know you've
07:25 - mentioned already some of your cs skills
07:28 - that you've or
07:29 - programs that you've done but what other
07:31 - cs skills did you learn and what do you
07:34 - use today in your work
07:36 - uh well along the way um since my
07:39 - background is in robotics use a lot of
07:42 - math so i i've done a lot of um
07:47 - well calculus and a lot of matrix
07:49 - algebra and for coding um we use
07:53 - a few languages one of them as i
07:54 - mentioned is called processing another
07:56 - one is called max other ones are called
07:59 - touch designer and a lot of these are
08:01 - free and in fact easy for young folks to
08:03 - just pick up and start to learn um
08:05 - processing for example has a huge
08:07 - community where you could ask questions
08:09 - and get feedback for how to do projects
08:11 - that you wanted to do
08:13 - that's so cool do you have any examples
08:15 - you'd like to share with us of other
08:16 - work you've done
08:18 - sure i've got an example of what
08:21 - um one project i did
08:23 - at mail
08:26 - see if i can navigate up to it
08:28 - this was uh a project for our dark ride
08:31 - this is a slow roller coaster ride in
08:33 - denver where we have an animated
08:35 - character out front who tells the story
08:38 - that you're sort of about to see in the
08:40 - ride so as we began programming the
08:42 - character i had to come up with a
08:44 - creative way to program these characters
08:46 - movements um using my own body and so
08:49 - what i'm going to show you is a video
08:52 - here's our little robot and
08:54 - there's me
08:56 - and what we do is we've got a camera on
08:58 - me
08:58 - and some software that i've written
09:00 - translating my movements
09:02 - right over to the robot
09:04 - and the robot can't move the same way i
09:07 - can with all these different joints it
09:09 - only has a few different movements but i
09:11 - was able using the computer science that
09:13 - i know to sort of translate my movements
09:16 - over to this robot and animate the
09:18 - character at the front of our we ride
09:22 - and how long does a project like that
09:24 - take
09:26 - that that one probably took like a month
09:28 - or so of uh of dedicated work for myself
09:30 - and a big team i pretty much never work
09:33 - alone on projects once you get to
09:35 - complicated projects it's all teamwork
09:37 - and uh i work on teams of you know maybe
09:40 - up to a dozen or more people if the
09:43 - project's big and sometimes just uh
09:44 - three or four people but a project like
09:46 - that took many people and a few months
09:50 - do you also share um like the coding
09:53 - project as well
09:56 - uh yes in fact
09:57 - sometimes um we sort of choose based on
10:01 - skills so if someone is better in
10:02 - robotics and someone is better in video
10:04 - we kind of split up
10:05 - who does what or also if someone wants
10:07 - to learn a new thing we're always eager
10:08 - to say if you want to pick this up why
10:10 - don't you try the robotics this time
10:13 - and i want to give a quick reminder to
10:15 - everyone tuning in please put your
10:17 - questions for danny and about all of his
10:20 - awesome work that he's doing with meow
10:21 - wolf um into the q a
10:24 - so danny where do you think your
10:26 - curiosity stemmed from
10:29 - well
10:30 - like i said i've kind of always been
10:32 - into um
10:33 - well taking things apart when i was
10:35 - little i had tape recorders and tape
10:37 - players and i don't know what got into
10:38 - me i would just want to figure out how
10:39 - they worked so i would kind of take them
10:41 - apart and then see that some of it was
10:44 - mechanical and some part was electrical
10:46 - and i would want to learn about the
10:47 - different parts and i think that you
10:50 - know taking things apart learning how
10:51 - things work understanding how systems
10:53 - work
10:54 - is kind of a fun skill for for anyone to
10:56 - develop
10:58 - so tell us more about yourself like what
11:00 - do you like to do outside of work
11:03 - oh well um i live here in santa fe new
11:05 - mexico and uh it's very beautiful so i
11:08 - like to go outdoors and hike and camp
11:10 - i like to play guitar and garden but one
11:15 - hobby that i have that is sort of cs
11:17 - related is the hobby of amateur radio
11:19 - also known
11:20 - as ham radio for weird historical
11:22 - reasons and i'll show you a picture
11:24 - about that
11:26 - so
11:26 - um when you're an amateur radio operator
11:28 - what you do is uh learn the science
11:31 - behind how radio works and build your
11:33 - own uh radios and antennas and
11:36 - communicate with people all over the
11:37 - world or uh off this world what i'm
11:40 - gonna show here is a picture on the left
11:41 - of an antenna at my house that i built
11:43 - and on the right is a picture i got from
11:45 - the international space station as it
11:47 - was going overhead and uh anyone
11:50 - students as young as junior high or high
11:52 - school can even get involved in amateur
11:53 - radio and imagine picking up pictures
11:55 - from the space stations or from weather
11:57 - satellites
11:58 - and i have a lot of fun doing that here
11:59 - in town
12:02 - that sounds super cool
12:03 - so a question about in your professional
12:06 - journey what were some of the titles
12:09 - that you had with the work that you were
12:11 - doing and then what are some of the
12:13 - salary ranges that someone could expect
12:15 - to make
12:16 - with those job titles
12:19 - well
12:20 - my uh journey went through a few
12:23 - different changes in fact i started
12:25 - in the arts field and worked in the
12:27 - music industry in a music recording
12:28 - studio for a long time before i became a
12:30 - roboticist in fact
12:32 - in those days i was making probably 30
12:34 - or 40 000
12:35 - running a very small studio
12:38 - during that time i got so interested in
12:40 - the electronics of it you know
12:42 - guitarists and how their signal goes
12:44 - through their pedals or how the mixing
12:46 - board works and i got into the
12:48 - electronics and went back to school so
12:50 - that's what got me back into electrical
12:52 - engineering
12:55 - russian military folks wouldn't mind
12:57 - muting their mics
12:58 - and
13:00 - so then i went back to school for the
13:02 - electrical engineering part i was in
13:03 - school for a while and after that
13:06 - was when i started to get uh jobs like a
13:10 - lecturer in in uh in engineering those
13:13 - kinds of things also pay around forty to
13:15 - fifty thousand dollars um
13:17 - and moving up uh i've worked as what's
13:20 - called a developer a software developer
13:23 - uh where you just say work for people
13:25 - who need custom software made for them
13:28 - um that
13:29 - that pay is often not per year but it
13:31 - really depends on the job so you can
13:33 - work on a job where you may get paid a
13:35 - hundred dollars for a small thing or a
13:36 - thousand dollars for a bigger thing and
13:38 - it really depends um so through the
13:40 - years i've kind of had several different
13:43 - types of of work and now landed where i
13:45 - am
13:47 - and would you be able to tell us like
13:49 - what is a typical salary range for a
13:52 - creative engineer
13:54 - yeah so creative engineers tend to makes
13:57 - uh over 75 000
13:59 - at meow wolf and uh and
14:03 - yeah
14:04 - and and and they're sort of the top and
14:06 - depends on how long you've been there in
14:08 - your experience and like many other
14:10 - companies that the more knowledge you
14:12 - have in your field and the more
14:13 - experience you have in your field the
14:15 - the better paid you are
14:17 - and so um
14:19 - for
14:20 - creative engineering could you start off
14:22 - do you need first of all a four-year
14:24 - degree do you need a bachelor's a
14:26 - master's a phd what is required to be a
14:30 - creative engineer
14:31 - well i see the most important
14:34 - part of it is just being a very
14:36 - inquisitive person who loves to
14:38 - design things and make things figure out
14:40 - how things work and
14:42 - you know start picking up the tools to
14:44 - do it like there's a lot of free
14:46 - software out there um and a lot of maker
14:49 - spaces and maker groups that you could
14:51 - sort of get involved with um these days
14:54 - and to be a creative engineer i don't
14:55 - think there's there really isn't a
14:57 - specific
14:58 - educational requirement it's really
15:00 - about your experience and what you know
15:02 - um
15:03 - sort of if you have the experience
15:04 - working in the the stuff that makes meow
15:06 - wolf work um
15:08 - that that's the kind of people that we
15:09 - like on our on our creative engineering
15:11 - team and in fact i should mention our
15:13 - team is several people with lots of
15:14 - different skills so i'm more of a
15:16 - roboticist and we have other people who
15:18 - specialize in lighting other people who
15:20 - specialize in sound others people who
15:22 - specialize in like the i.t
15:25 - infrastructure even so um there's sort
15:27 - of room for all kinds of different
15:29 - interests in creative engineering
15:32 - and so when you come into this space um
15:34 - do you already need to be an expert with
15:36 - coding and computer science or do you
15:38 - get to learn on the job
15:40 - how do you gain more experience with
15:42 - computer science
15:44 - well we don't expect that everyone knows
15:46 - everything right away so um there are
15:49 - some
15:49 - some common things that a lot of folks
15:51 - in our field know so there's a platform
15:54 - out there called arduino that is great
15:56 - for making um circuits and interactive
15:59 - elements
16:00 - that's something we use a lot so if if
16:02 - you know arduino that's that will help
16:04 - you sort of in the creative engineering
16:07 - field
16:08 - but um like i said we're not super
16:10 - specific and i don't expect everyone to
16:12 - know robotics but if you want to get on
16:14 - a project that makes you learn robotics
16:16 - i'll be there to sort of mentor you and
16:18 - that's another thing our team does for
16:20 - each other is you know help each other
16:21 - out with our expertise
16:23 - so there is opportunity for mentorship
16:26 - once you
16:27 - land a job or start working in this
16:29 - field
16:30 - yeah definitely since so much of the job
16:33 - is very unique um you know there aren't
16:35 - a lot of places like meow wolf out there
16:37 - the
16:38 - the stuff that you know is pretty
16:40 - specific and so it's pretty valuable to
16:42 - know that stuff we cross over a lot into
16:44 - how buildings are made too so if you
16:46 - know a lot about the electrical systems
16:48 - or the heating systems in a building as
16:51 - a construction uh or architect worker um
16:54 - that's also a great skill to have
16:58 - great so we have a question from bargin
17:00 - shout out from hillsborough wisconsin
17:02 - what type of process does meow wolf use
17:06 - to come up with their new exhibit
17:08 - um
17:09 - well that's a great question um we're
17:12 - we like to do brainstorming where we
17:14 - kind of all get together and just come
17:16 - up with ideas and um maybe someone will
17:19 - have uh a story idea that's really
17:22 - uh start of an idea like you know
17:25 - someone's going on a journey to a place
17:27 - and then we kind of brainstorm as a big
17:29 - group and i've been part of
17:31 - brainstorming groups with several
17:32 - hundred people if you can imagine that
17:34 - all kind of
17:36 - dreaming up new stories and and ways to
17:38 - tell a story in a place like now
17:42 - we have another question this comes from
17:44 - hopefully pronouncing this correctly
17:45 - kaio-keo regarding coding what languages
17:49 - do you mostly use
17:51 - oh so
17:52 - the top languages that are used on our
17:54 - creative engineering team are
17:58 - touch designer which is a visual
18:00 - language max which is a visual language
18:03 - as well and what i mean by that is um
18:05 - you code by making blocks and connecting
18:09 - them with lines and watching the data
18:10 - sort of flow between the code box and
18:12 - it's a different way of coding than
18:14 - writing text which is an another very
18:17 - popular way of writing code in my group
18:19 - we use
18:20 - processing which is a form of java we
18:23 - also use python a lot as well
18:27 - great maureen garda's class is asking
18:30 - what is the most difficult part of your
18:32 - job
18:34 - oh wow well
18:36 - you know um there are two tricky parts
18:38 - the first tricky part is um
18:41 - figuring out how to take an artistic
18:43 - idea and make it happen technically
18:45 - right you have to sort of interpret
18:48 - almost like interpreting poetry and
18:50 - translating it to another language or
18:51 - really you're translating it into math
18:53 - and code that could be a very tricky
18:55 - part of a project the second trickiest
18:57 - part is actually installing the thing in
18:58 - place some we have to really run wires
19:00 - everywhere and if you can imagine say
19:02 - inside your car how many wires there are
19:04 - and how many buttons and lights and
19:06 - knobs that's a lot of wiring and i often
19:08 - end up completely inside a robot with
19:10 - just my boots sticking out as i'm
19:12 - running wiring
19:14 - it sounds tedious like it takes it's it
19:17 - can be time consuming sometimes
19:20 - it really can yeah a lot of things can
19:22 - take time but you know with patients and
19:24 - with a good team it's a lot of fun
19:26 - so we have another question here from
19:28 - tierra bobola what future technologies
19:31 - can you imagine fourth grade students
19:33 - will be using more of when they are in
19:35 - high school and college careers
19:38 - oh that's a very great question
19:41 - you know i'm in robotics so i can't help
19:43 - but imagine that we'll see more robots
19:45 - all over society uh helping people out
19:48 - and that's a great thing that folks who
19:50 - do now is start thinking of all the
19:52 - wacky robots that don't exist yet that
19:54 - could exist to help people out in the
19:57 - future i can't wait to see uh what we do
20:00 - with that and i can't wait to see maybe
20:02 - robotic characters and stuff and now
20:04 - wolf that would be amazing
20:06 - that's so creative that video you showed
20:08 - us
20:09 - it was a little creepy but intriguing
20:11 - i'm very curious about this uh you know
20:14 - store now in las vegas to check it out
20:17 - so we have another question from maureen
20:20 - garda again so what does your daily
20:22 - schedule look like like what is a
20:24 - typical day for you what are some of
20:25 - your tasks or duties
20:28 - well so a typical day um maybe like
20:31 - today
20:32 - um
20:32 - i'll wake up and you know check my
20:34 - emails and catch up with all my teams
20:36 - and what's going on uh in the company
20:38 - and with our projects
20:40 - um and then i'll usually have a few
20:42 - meetings with people and that's where we
20:43 - sort of get together to either make a
20:45 - decision about something important or
20:47 - maybe bring up something important that
20:49 - we are not aware of
20:51 - um and then i spend most of my day um
20:54 - either writing code or uh designing
20:57 - circuit boards and stuff like that to uh
20:59 - to make our exhibits work
21:02 - so next up i do want to ask you some
21:03 - questions so that you can give our
21:05 - viewers um classrooms tuning in students
21:07 - some advice so looking back on all of
21:10 - your work and educational journey what
21:12 - obstacles or challenges did you face and
21:15 - how did you approach or overcome them
21:18 - um see that's that's an interesting
21:20 - question because as i mentioned earlier
21:22 - i had to transition sort of into the
21:25 - stem field from the arts field at one
21:27 - point so i was working in a music
21:29 - recording studio and i didn't know a lot
21:31 - about the technology but when i went to
21:33 - school and started learning the
21:35 - technology i found it very difficult and
21:36 - i don't think that's surprising for a
21:38 - lot of people that sometimes the math
21:39 - and stuff is hard and even today i run
21:42 - into very hard technical problems all
21:44 - the time um still it's not like one day
21:47 - you just solve them but what i did
21:49 - discover when i faced these problems was
21:51 - that i wasn't the only one
21:53 - you could always
21:54 - find other people who are as confused as
21:57 - you inform study groups
21:59 - um form teams
22:01 - form um communities and next thing you
22:04 - know you're helping each other learn and
22:06 - you kind of all level up as a group
22:10 - so what were there people who helped you
22:12 - along the way
22:13 - who were they and how did they help you
22:16 - oh yeah i had i guess a lot of help from
22:19 - from my teachers along the way who
22:21 - supported me um one in particular when i
22:23 - was in high school um i had a physics
22:26 - teacher named mr bertson who saw that i
22:28 - was interested in sculpting with weird
22:31 - materials
22:33 - while i was in art class and he offered
22:35 - me his physics lab so that i could use
22:38 - his bunsen burners to melt glass
22:40 - and make sculptures out of that kind of
22:42 - stuff but he also taught me how to
22:44 - properly use lab equipment and also
22:47 - taught me the physics of what i was
22:48 - doing with the materials i was playing
22:50 - with and for me it was so important to
22:51 - have someone who was interested in my
22:53 - creativity but also interested in
22:55 - teaching me what i was doing so that i
22:57 - could
22:57 - make better projects later
23:00 - yeah
23:02 - and was there someone specifically that
23:04 - helped you perhaps with the cs you
23:05 - mentioned that
23:07 - there's challenges with the math and
23:09 - computer science aspects of that um is
23:12 - there someone that stands out to you
23:13 - that helped you through those difficult
23:14 - times
23:16 - um well i had
23:18 - professors who helped me out but really
23:20 - it was it was my my teammates and my
23:22 - friends and and the
23:24 - the people in the classes with me who
23:26 - were just as as stumped as i was on some
23:29 - of these hard math problems uh my my
23:31 - friends like henry my friends like
23:33 - vladimir who we would sit there and at
23:36 - the same computer look at the same code
23:37 - all three of us and go what is this
23:40 - doing and then
23:41 - at some point one of us would get it and
23:43 - then all of us would get it
23:46 - yeah that sounds
23:47 - i can relate to that as well
23:49 - and so just a quick reminder please add
23:52 - your questions to the q a as we're
23:54 - getting ready to wrap up
23:56 - so if students are interested in
23:58 - pursuing similar career paths like the
24:00 - ones you've mentioned as a creative
24:02 - engineer what are some steps that they
24:04 - can take
24:06 - well um
24:07 - you know keep keep making things find
24:09 - find some tools that you could use to to
24:12 - learn to make things however you like
24:14 - whether it's
24:16 - writing poetry or playing guitar or
24:18 - writing code
24:20 - um you know find a way to uh to learn a
24:23 - skill and sort of get better at it and
24:27 - learn to express things
24:30 - and if you could give one piece of
24:32 - advice to students who are listening
24:34 - um it could be work related or not what
24:37 - would it be
24:39 - oh wow um
24:41 - well i guess
24:42 - i'll just
24:44 - jump off of that that same answer i just
24:46 - gave that you should start start
24:48 - building and start writing and start
24:51 - making the world that you want to live
24:52 - in
24:55 - that's great advice
24:56 - and so this is a question from mr a how
24:59 - long does it take to work on a single
25:01 - project
25:03 - oh well it all depends some projects can
25:06 - be this big and those might take me like
25:09 - a day
25:10 - i sometimes i have let's see if i could
25:12 - pull something up here i have a project
25:14 - that maybe you could see
25:16 - this is might look like some of your
25:18 - experiments here just wiring and sensors
25:20 - i'm testing out a bunch of sensors to
25:21 - see how they work a project like this
25:23 - might only take me a week
25:25 - because there's a lot of um code out
25:28 - there that i could grab test and then um
25:31 - see if things worked out but a bigger
25:33 - project like for example that robot that
25:35 - i showed you earlier might take a couple
25:36 - of months and the longest project i the
25:38 - longest i've worked on a project is
25:40 - probably about a couple of months
25:42 - and do you mean that comes from like the
25:45 - idea
25:46 - to the actual finished product
25:49 - yeah that's usually from from the time
25:51 - that we start
25:53 - drawing some drawings of what we think
25:55 - it should look like until it's really
25:56 - done that that can actually take even i
25:58 - had i guess i hadn't considered at the
26:00 - beginning the whole
26:01 - concept and how you come up with your
26:03 - idea that can take a whole month just by
26:05 - itself if you have a very big concept
26:07 - like i know this when we come up with
26:08 - our stories for our whole
26:10 - uh building that could take several
26:12 - months
26:13 - and so really quick danny what is the
26:15 - most fun what's the funnest most fun
26:18 - thing about your job
26:20 - oh man
26:21 - working working with a team of people
26:24 - that i really like to build something
26:26 - that that we think is going to inspire
26:28 - people um to do this themselves we
26:31 - we want people to walk out of meow wolf
26:33 - thinking um i could do this too let's go
26:36 - out there and change the world to to
26:38 - match what we want it to be like
26:41 - well thank you danny for joining us
26:42 - today and sharing your cs journeys and
26:44 - thank you teachers and students for
26:46 - joining in please remember to check out
