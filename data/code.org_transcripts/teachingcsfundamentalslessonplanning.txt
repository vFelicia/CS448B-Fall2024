00:08 - let's take a look at how the lessons for
00:10 - computer science fundamentals are
00:12 - structured
00:14 - each lesson begins with an overview that
00:16 - includes a small table giving you an
00:17 - idea of what the lesson will cover
00:20 - there's a getting started section where
00:22 - you and your students will access your
00:23 - prior knowledge and build excitement for
00:25 - the learning activity to come
00:27 - once you're geared up you can dive into
00:29 - the activity section of the lesson
00:31 - where you will be helping your students
00:33 - work through either a tutorial on code
00:34 - studio or an unplugged activity that you
00:37 - run in your classroom
00:38 - the lesson will finish with a wrap-up
00:40 - section where you'll debrief and
00:42 - highlight important cs concepts that
00:43 - were illustrated during the activity
00:46 - of course you'll probably want to create
00:47 - your own lesson plans and curriculum for
00:49 - your computer science classroom if you
00:51 - do here's some tips that you might want
00:53 - to keep in mind
00:55 - tip 1
00:56 - try using a spiraling curriculum design
00:59 - introduce concepts once and then revisit
01:01 - them throughout your lesson plans and
01:02 - throughout the year to help reinforce
01:04 - the concepts
01:06 - tip 2
01:07 - create a blended learning experience
01:10 - students shouldn't be on the computer
01:11 - 100 of the time when they're learning
01:13 - computer science building unplugged
01:15 - activities into your curriculum helps
01:17 - students apply their computer science
01:18 - learning to the real world
01:20 - tip 3
01:21 - break your curriculum down into
01:23 - bite-sized chunks at code.org we use
01:26 - stages and levels but whatever you want
01:27 - to call them in your classroom make sure
01:29 - students understand that learning
01:31 - computer science is a journey with many
01:32 - steps
01:34 - tip four the last tip make sure that
01:37 - whatever curriculum you're developing is
01:39 - aligned to your local standards and
01:40 - college and career readiness skills
01:43 - at the end of each of our lessons you'll
01:44 - find links to common core state
01:46 - standards and other technology standards
01:48 - that will help you tailor your lessons
01:49 - so that your students learn the things
01:51 - they need in order to be successful
