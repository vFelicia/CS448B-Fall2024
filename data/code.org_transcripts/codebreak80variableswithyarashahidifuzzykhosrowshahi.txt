02:10 - hi and welcome to code break my name is
02:14 - Hadi and across zoom Facebook live and
02:17 - YouTube live we have tens of thousands
02:19 - of people joining us
02:20 - so yeah they were hoping to build the
02:21 - world's largest live interactive
02:23 - classroom with so many students at home
02:25 - my team at code.org invites families
02:27 - everywhere to join us for a weekly dose
02:30 - of inspiration community in computer
02:31 - science I'm here with my daughter and
02:34 - sidekick Sophia she's a budding computer
02:37 - scientist and I'd like to introduce our
02:39 - first special guests the amazing actress
02:41 - and activist Yara Shahidi yeah hi how
02:45 - are you and we're you calling us from
02:47 - I'm good I'm calling from LA where I am
02:50 - with my family quarantined and how are
02:54 - you spending this time with everything
02:55 - closed I mean it's been a mixture of
02:58 - keeping busy while learning and then
03:01 - lots of family activities one of my
03:05 - brothers made a podcast in his free time
03:07 - so it's really just been trying to stay
03:10 - creative and you've been in school that

03:41 - because not only am i doing it both of
03:43 - my brothers who are in middle and high
03:45 - school have been distance learning I
03:48 - know it can be difficult I think the way
03:50 - that I've done it is I've tried to
03:53 - create my own goals for myself because
03:55 - it's sometimes hard to stay motivated
03:56 - with their goals so whether that I mean
03:59 - something super simple I am a secretly a
04:01 - grandmother so whether that's
04:03 - knowing that I get to crochet when I
04:04 - finish an assignment or get to go learn
04:06 - a new skill then that's usually what
04:09 - inspires me to get through whatever I
04:11 - need to finish it well I'd like to

07:10 - you can visit code.org slash questions
07:13 - to submit your questions today we have
07:15 - three parts in our episode we're gonna
07:17 - talk about variables today and we're
07:19 - gonna learn about variables first in an
07:21 - unplugged way then about using variables
07:24 - in games and lastly about using
07:27 - variables and apps valuables are one of
07:29 - the most important things in computer
07:31 - science but before we move on to today's
07:34 - lesson we want to welcome some students
07:35 - to demo their creations to our special
07:37 - guests last week's challenge was to make
07:40 - your own flow chart or to modify the
07:42 - apps we made for you the magic 8-ball
07:44 - app for the DECA stroller app and each
07:46 - week when you share your creations we'll
07:48 - invite you to show them the best ones on
07:50 - next week's episode so Yara and fuzzy
07:54 - you ready to meet our two students from
07:56 - last week I'm so ready
07:58 - alright so doc who's from India
08:00 - submitted a dice roller project this
08:02 - week doc we're gonna unmute you can you
08:06 - tell us more about yes are you there
08:10 - yeah we're from India hello hi their way
08:17 - from India India let me screen share
08:22 - your app and then you can tell us more
08:24 - about it it's a very nice hat by the way
08:29 - it's actually no there are two variables
08:32 - first one is first variable the first
08:34 - variable we put a straightforward
08:37 - equivalent to random integer second one
08:41 - there if there is variable which we put
08:43 - equivalent to random number which which
08:46 - it picks from 1 to 10 as as we click
08:50 - dark then there is number come whether
08:53 - it comes 1 then there is equal to 1 6
08:55 - then it comes to then earlier we press
08:58 - alia then it comes 5 so this number 6 is
09:01 - more than 5 result Dutchman's so it's
09:04 - like check not only we made a dice
09:07 - rolling after you guys created this from
09:09 - scratch again click then action alia and
09:17 - shows who wins aliens then click again
09:20 - click again click ducks again here
09:24 - earlier and result here you go duck she
09:27 - wins again there are two numbers equal
09:30 - they are two numbers equal then mesh
09:31 - right then
09:32 - the ties I got it and it's all your data
09:35 - disturb my sister all right very cool
09:42 - the second app we have is from Abigail
09:45 - unfortunately Abigail's audio isn't
09:48 - working so she can't speak with us
09:49 - Abigail's from Vermont and she took our
09:52 - magic 8-ball app which was a very very
09:54 - simple app and made something much more
09:56 - complicated she made six different or
10:00 - seven different six different games only
10:03 - one Yara or fuzzy are there any of these
10:06 - you want to try Yara go ahead I play
10:10 - tic-tac-toe excellent I'm not not that
10:14 - Jerry tic-tac-toe is the one she hasn't
10:16 - finished yet
10:17 - okay it's the only one I tried before it
10:20 - doesn't work yes you are the truth or
10:23 - dare yes
10:24 - okay let's try two three all right Yara
10:29 - do you want on truth or dare I'll do a
10:33 - truth all right let's go Sofia you want
10:38 - to click I'm nervous oh gosh
10:48 - it happens okay just because you're
10:52 - alive of 10,000 people you have a
10:54 - question from Yara so there's another
11:00 - one of these apps is the cursor maze
11:02 - check this out Sofia has wanted to play
11:04 - this all morning so this is a cursor
11:07 - maze app where you need to control the
11:09 - mouse to get from the start to finish
11:12 - without touching any of the blocks so
11:15 - she has to move the mouse very carefully
11:18 - and it gets harder than easy yeah and
11:22 - it's really simple after this I don't
11:25 - know this is one out of six apps and
11:27 - then you have to click next level right
11:33 - this is fenomena Thank You Abigail for
11:36 - sharing that app Thank You Abigail yeah
11:39 - thank you
11:40 - you want to play an applause sound for
11:42 - both Abigail I'm - for their apps yes
11:46 - sorry you were on mute alright so for
11:50 - today our word of the day is variable a
11:52 - variable is a way to store hold
11:55 - information that can change you may be
11:57 - familiar with variables from math class
11:59 - like in that class when you say X equals
12:03 - 5 X is a variable and it holds the
12:06 - number value 5 but variables and
12:08 - programming are different in two key
12:10 - ways first of all and programming and
12:13 - computer science valuables can change so
12:15 - X can start like a 5 but then it can
12:18 - become a 6 or a 7 or an 8 it doesn't
12:20 - stay the same the second thing is
12:23 - valuables and computer science can
12:24 - change can hold many different types of
12:26 - values they can be numbers they can have
12:29 - words or even more complicated
12:30 - information now why would we use a
12:33 - variable anytime a computer program
12:35 - wants to keep track of anything because
12:37 - it's the variables basically act like
12:39 - its memory like to remember the score
12:41 - and a theme or to remember the names of
12:43 - the players or anytime you type
12:45 - something in an app the app remembers it
12:47 - in America now we're going to see
12:50 - variables in action with health
12:52 - Yara so we're gonna switch to gallery
12:55 - view to see all the students on the
12:57 - screen and I want every student on the
12:59 - screen including fuzzy and Yara to all
13:02 - the variables your basic variable and
13:06 - each variable has a name so yeah we can
13:10 - see your names on the screen so Yara
13:12 - what's your name
13:13 - it's Yara Yara so that's the name of
13:17 - your variable so each file gets assigned
13:20 - a value so I'd like you each to pick a
13:22 - number between 1 and 10 and to hold up
13:25 - your number up on the screen so we can
13:27 - see all the numbers assigned to all the
13:28 - different variables
13:32 - alright so Yara what number are you
13:35 - ships
13:35 - storing seven you're seven so you could
13:39 - say that Yara equals seven so now Jana
13:44 - I'm gonna ask you to change your value
13:46 - and so when I do you can like shimmy
13:47 - your hands when you get a new okay
13:49 - everybody else keep your numbers up and
13:52 - I want to make a number that combines
13:54 - the numbers in the variables Owen and
13:57 - Evelyn so we're gonna highlight Owen
14:00 - that's Owen Owen what number are you
14:03 - showing that's a two and then Evelyn and
14:08 - Evelyn I think is showing a three so
14:11 - y'all I want to say Yara equals Owen
14:14 - plus Evelyn oh so you're already a five
14:19 - you changed from a seven to five so when
14:22 - we say yarn ankles Owen Plus Evelyn you
14:24 - set one variable to the value of two
14:26 - other variables now Owen and Evelyn can
14:29 - you both change your numbers pick a
14:30 - number between one and five a different
14:33 - number all right and Yara can you
14:39 - reevaluate the are equal Owen Plus
14:41 - Evelyn all right so you see now Owen is
14:44 - a four and Evelyn is a 2 so Y became a
14:47 - six now I want to ask Evelyn your number
14:50 - changed did your name change no no and
14:57 - that's that's right because with
14:59 - variables the value of a variable can
15:01 - keep changing a computer program can
15:03 - change it all the time then
15:05 - the variables stays the same all right
15:07 - you can put your hands down we're gonna
15:09 - do something totally different now we're
15:11 - going to be variables in a different way
15:13 - what we're going to do is show how
15:15 - variables health computer programs
15:17 - remember and to do this we're going to
15:19 - have yara act like a computer program
15:21 - for ordering a food basket okay
15:24 - yara since you're an actress you're
15:26 - gonna act like a computer who can't
15:28 - remember anything without saving
15:30 - information and we want a great role yet
15:33 - mm-hm
15:35 - we we wanted to act like you have no
15:37 - memory without the help of your
15:38 - variables and all the students you see
15:40 - on screen are gonna be your variables
15:42 - they can save information for you is
15:44 - that sound okay that sounds great right
15:46 - did you remember anything I just said no
15:50 - actually you need to remember what I
15:52 - said but once you're running the
15:55 - computer program you should forget it
15:57 - all great got it Sofia here is gonna
16:00 - order a fruit basket from Yara and Yara
16:02 - each time Sofia asks for new fruit to
16:05 - add to the basket I want you to ask one
16:07 - of the student variables on screen to
16:09 - save that piece of information by
16:11 - writing it down so you can say for
16:13 - example Naomi please save an apple and
16:16 - Naomi will write it down and while
16:19 - you're doing this
16:20 - Fuzzy's you're going to be a counter
16:22 - variable I want you to start with the
16:24 - number zero and then each time Sophia
16:27 - asks for a new fruit add one to your
16:29 - number so you'll show how much fruit
16:31 - Sophie has asked for I've been packing
16:34 - are you ready yeah all right Sophia go I
16:39 - like apple please stam yo can you
16:44 - remember an apple it's the same I was
16:47 - going to write this down next I like an
16:52 - orange Seth can you do me a favor and
16:56 - remember orange and write it down Seth I
17:00 - want a pear a new shot can you please
17:05 - remember pear for me can I have a grape
17:08 - please Naomi can you remember grapefruit
17:13 - for me please I'd like a Kiwi - all
17:18 - right Serena
17:19 - will you write down QE for me and lastly
17:23 - I would like a banana okay Amir can you
17:27 - remember banana for me please all right
17:32 - before we make this fruit basket how
17:34 - much is this fruit order going to cost
17:35 - let's say it's $2 per piece of fruit how
17:39 - much should Sophia pay let's do a poll
17:41 - from our audience all the folks on zoom'
17:43 - were not on camera you can look at fuzzy
17:46 - the counter and we are going to ask how
17:48 - much does Sophia's fruit basket cost is
17:50 - it $12 or is it two dollars per fruit or
17:54 - is it two times fuzzy or is it all of
17:57 - the above all of the above God said
18:00 - don't tell us the answers people are
18:01 - actually filling out the poll but all
18:05 - right almost half the students have
18:07 - already voted fuzzy sort of gave away
18:09 - possibly gave away the answer might not
18:12 - be right we'll see
18:13 - all right let's share the poll results
18:16 - of what students guessed
18:17 - all right before it was almost a dead
18:20 - heat but we have now 70% of you guessed
18:23 - all of the above and that's correct so
18:26 - the food basket is gonna cost $12
18:28 - because it's $2 per fruits and Fuzzy's
18:31 - been the food counter counting how many
18:33 - think Sophia's ordered now Yara dear
18:36 - remember Sophia's fruit order I don't
18:39 - I'm not sure anybody remembers it but
18:42 - since you're a computer program you
18:43 - don't need to have your own memory your
18:45 - variables save that for you so if you'd
18:48 - like you can now ask your variables to
18:49 - show their information up on the screen
18:51 - so you can see it yes please well my
18:55 - variables share what we've stored so can
18:59 - all the variables hold up your pieces of
19:01 - paper so Yara can see see an apple pear
19:12 - grapefruit keep holding it up so y'all
19:17 - can you now from what you see make the
19:20 - fruit basket that that's Sophia ordered
19:22 - thrust yes
19:28 - I see an apple a pear a grapefruit okay
19:33 - so I have some fruit with me I have my
19:35 - apple have my kiwi I'm going to draw a
19:41 - pear I have my grapefruit and I'm gonna
19:49 - do a nice round pear for everybody
19:55 - artist so yo can you now hand the bowl
19:59 - of fruit to Sophia together we want to
20:01 - test out a really new zoom feature
20:03 - called zoom fruit delivery gladly
20:13 - Sophia thank you everybody for the
20:25 - variables for the healthy determined
20:26 - helping our food delivery program
20:29 - remember her fruit order so to recap
20:31 - first we use variables to store numbers
20:33 - and we showed how the values changed and
20:35 - next we use variables to store text so
20:38 - the computer er could remember how to
20:40 - prepare a food order that we're gonna
20:42 - explore more about it valuable soon but
20:44 - first let's learn a little bit more
20:45 - about God so Yara you're our third
20:48 - special guest to play our lightning
20:49 - round game we're gonna put 60 seconds on
20:52 - the clock and Sophia's going to keep
20:54 - score actually on an app she Scott is
20:57 - gonna keep score and and your goal is to
20:59 - get through as many questions as
21:00 - possible and beat our current score of
21:03 - nine nine questions which were answered
21:06 - by Sal Khan so you want to make the
21:08 - comments but also make it fast
21:10 - I've got it all right Sophia go umm
21:13 - country you have all you want to visit
21:15 - but haven't Greece advocated what did
21:20 - you want to be when you grew up a
21:22 - historian favorite drink um my go-to
21:29 - black tea my side ask something you
21:33 - can't ever eat no matter how many people
21:35 - love it sardines the last person you hug
21:41 - know
21:42 - living with you not living with me oh my
21:45 - goodness
21:46 - my friend Jacqueline 30 seconds your
21:50 - favorite smell um I love just any
21:55 - kitchen smell I love this smell of the
21:58 - kitchen being used because it means that
21:59 - we're about to eat
22:00 - what were your hobbies when you were a
22:02 - kid I loved everything from exploring
22:07 - and I was in karate and I would rock
22:11 - climb what was her score seven so that
22:20 - was variable so close thank you so much
22:23 - and we're gonna play a little applause
22:25 - sound all right so I have a few more
22:30 - questions for both fuzzy and yah for
22:32 - each of you how did you become a
22:34 - standout in your field and especially in
22:36 - a field for both of you that has a lack
22:38 - of diversity and representation you want
22:44 - me to go well yeah go ahead fuzzy so I
22:50 - don't think it was intentional when I
22:53 - I've always thought that diversity was
22:56 - very important and I'd like to I tried
22:59 - to work in companies that were very
23:01 - diverse I find that having working on
23:05 - products that are user facing it's
23:07 - really important to build stuff that a
23:11 - lot of people can use so I try to
23:14 - surround myself with a lot of diverse
23:16 - people and that would be able to build
23:19 - things that you know have have different
23:21 - viewpoints one of the things that I
23:23 - remember for example with sheets is
23:24 - having someone on the team that was
23:27 - basically hearing-impaired originally
23:30 - impaired helped us empathize more and
23:32 - build products that met the needs of
23:34 - visually impaired more so diversity was
23:37 - really important for us there and how
23:39 - Hollywood doesn't have nearly as much
23:42 - diversity as a lot of people who wish it
23:44 - did yeah um well I'm grateful because I
23:47 - got into this because I love to read I'm
23:49 - sorry till I actually didn't watch much
23:51 - television until I was 13 we'd watch an
23:54 - hour
23:55 - on Saturdays mouths about it so it's fun
23:58 - for me to be a television actor who
23:59 - didn't watch TV but it was because I
24:01 - love telling stories and so a lot of
24:04 - what I do is when I'd get a script or
24:06 - have to go audition it was really about
24:08 - what story are we telling and I think
24:10 - similarly to fuzzy I found places in
24:13 - which diversity was really valued so
24:15 - whether that be on blackish or even now
24:17 - I'm grown ish it was something where I
24:19 - didn't even have to be a conversation
24:20 - because everyone knew how important it
24:22 - was not only for a great work
24:24 - environment but just for a great final
24:27 - product - and we've had the best time
24:29 - and now we are in the role of making
24:32 - television and that has been so much fun
24:35 - because we get to bring to life stories
24:37 - that I'm just discovering or learning
24:40 - about and we're constantly meeting new
24:42 - people who have incredible things to
24:44 - share and why do you think it's
24:46 - important to increase representation of
24:48 - women or people of color and fields such
24:51 - as technology it's always been really
24:54 - important to me I had the privilege of
24:55 - going to an all-girls school and I
24:57 - remember what that did for me because I
24:58 - at no point did I process like oh the
25:01 - sciences weren't meant for me or stem
25:03 - wasn't meant for me because I was
25:05 - surrounded by people who proved that it
25:06 - was but I think just to Fuzzy's point we
25:11 - need diverse teams of people in order to
25:13 - make products that reflect what our
25:15 - world looks like and I think so much so
25:18 - many people have so much to contribute
25:19 - that it's important that we decrease the
25:21 - barriers that just stop people from
25:23 - being able to contribute study computer
25:28 - science while you're at Harvard or high
25:30 - school either does it's so funny that
25:32 - you say that I'm about to sign up for a
25:34 - class for my summer class I haven't
25:39 - decided yet
25:40 - I have friends so a lot of my actual all
25:42 - my girlfriends I think I've taken a
25:44 - computer science class and I'm beyond
25:46 - I'm the odd person out right now so I'm
25:48 - taking more suggestions I'm speaking of
25:54 - diversity by the way one thing that's
25:55 - unique is all of us right here Sophia
25:57 - myself fuzzy and Y are all for Iranian
26:00 - Americans the way nice t-shirt huh D
26:05 - yeah I'm wearing an image
26:07 - t-shirt because fuzzy and I are also
26:10 - immigrants as well
26:11 - Oh Thank You Evelyn for showing a heart
26:14 - so yeah we have some questions from our
26:16 - student panelists as well one of our
26:18 - producers at Kyra is going to introduce
26:20 - these students hi ara so we have two
26:26 - questions one friend a ha who has a
26:28 - question about girls and achievements
26:30 - and they hum going to onion you what
26:33 - suggestions do you have for girls to
26:35 - stay confident in whatever field they
26:37 - choose and to become leaders in their
26:39 - community yeah hi I know that's a
26:41 - wonderful question I think what I've
26:43 - always relied on is I always say my
26:46 - support network and so for me that's my
26:49 - family I come from a really cool
26:51 - matriarchy of women but that's also my
26:54 - chosen family my friends my professors
26:56 - and teachers and the reason I say that
26:58 - is that there's so much happening in the
27:00 - world that often times you can run into
27:01 - barriers that try and convince you that
27:03 - this is an ear space but that's why I
27:05 - rely on the people around me not only
27:07 - for that confidence boost but to
27:09 - constantly get better at whatever I'm
27:10 - trying to achieve but I think having
27:13 - those people around me have helped me
27:15 - through every step of the way
27:17 - and to always be open to learning thank
27:21 - you so much and we also have our last
27:25 - question from Amir so Amir I'm going to
27:27 - unmute you he had a question about
27:29 - achievement yeah what drives you to
27:32 - achieve your goals and motivates you to
27:34 - never give up
27:35 - that's a great question Amir and I've
27:38 - been thinking about that a lot
27:39 - especially now that we're all at home
27:41 - and life looks very different right now
27:43 - but I think what's been important for my
27:46 - entire family are finding ways to
27:48 - continue to be of service to my many
27:50 - communities not only the communities
27:52 - that my family are part of being black
27:54 - in Iranian but just the many communities
27:56 - that I think support us and so sometimes
27:58 - that small like on blackish being able
28:01 - to tell really great stories that
28:03 - hopefully spread a point of view and
28:05 - sometimes that's trying to figure out
28:07 - how I can use an opportunity to give
28:09 - back and how I can support other people
28:12 - but that's always helped motivate me
28:15 - because otherwise if you're not doing if
28:16 - you're just doing it for yourself
28:18 - sometimes it's hard to find the
28:19 - motivation but when you do
28:21 - for the betterment of so many people
28:22 - around you then I think that's what
28:24 - convinces me to get up when I'm not
28:25 - trying to accomplish something to go to
28:27 - go do it thank you you're on thanks Amir
28:32 - yeah thank you thank you so much and
28:36 - Yara thank you for joining us today to
28:37 - share your story we're all a part of
28:40 - Yara soon so can we switch to gallery
28:42 - view for the audience so all of our
28:44 - students can wave goodbye to Yara and so
28:47 - if you can you play an applause thank
28:48 - you thank you my first computer science
28:55 - class thank you so much thank you
28:59 - alright fuzzy let's chat a little bit
29:01 - more though bye bye Yara so fuzzy we're
29:03 - gonna chat a little bit more about your
29:05 - background and your work at Google with
29:07 - Google Spreadsheets while fuzzy and I
29:09 - chats if you have questions don't forget
29:11 - to send them in at code.org slash
29:13 - questions you have about two minutes if
29:15 - you want to submit a question so fuzzy
29:18 - how old were you when you began learning
29:20 - how to code and how did you get into it
29:22 - what's your story about how you got into
29:24 - this I don't even remember how old I was
29:27 - because I was a as you can tell I'm I'm
29:31 - not a young young young one like you all
29:34 - so back then I was actually history
29:37 - major in college and when I graduated I
29:40 - didn't I was having a hard time finding
29:42 - a job so I ended up selling life
29:45 - insurance for a while then real estate
29:47 - that my wife said wouldn't it be great
29:50 - if we open up a Subway sandwich shop and
29:52 - worked all day and all night together
29:54 - and I said sure we tried that for a
29:56 - while it wasn't only it wasn't until my
29:59 - 30s when I actually started really
30:01 - coding I had a job in the banking
30:03 - industry and was coding there and
30:06 - teaching myself most of the coding and
30:08 - that's when I came up with the idea of
30:11 - taking sell spreadsheets and converting
30:14 - him into Web Apps and the idea with the
30:17 - help of a lot of amazing people we sold
30:20 - that product to Google and it became
30:23 - Google sheets so it wasn't like I wasn't
30:26 - coding as a young kid like everyone here
30:30 - that's really kind of what most people
30:32 - envision that people
30:33 - start companies and sell them you know
30:36 - our whiz kids who learn when they're
30:37 - like really young and then sell their
30:39 - startup when they're like right out of
30:40 - school or something but you'd between
30:43 - being an insurance salesperson and real
30:45 - estate sales persons the sandwich sales
30:47 - person make great sandwiches to make
30:50 - great sandwiches yeah it's pretty
30:52 - amazing that Google Spreadsheets was
30:54 - basically an acquisition by Google of a
30:56 - company made by a sandwich style
30:59 - sandwich shop owner and by the way if
31:02 - you think about it there's a connection
31:03 - between spreadsheets and our earlier
31:05 - activity when we were all in a grid the
31:07 - students were in a grid each one of us
31:10 - was a variable just like a spreadsheet
31:11 - stores a value in each of the cells in
31:14 - its grid and each cell in a spreadsheet
31:16 - has a name like a 1 or B 1 or C 2 just
31:20 - like a variable and in fact I often tell
31:22 - people if you've ever written a command
31:24 - in a spreadsheet using a formula like
31:26 - saying this cell is going to be the sum
31:28 - of this and that you've written one line
31:30 - of code and that's how you can start
31:31 - learning computer programming so now
31:35 - we're gonna go into the second sentence
31:37 - of today's class which is learning about
31:39 - how to use variables and games and so
31:43 - fuzzy Sophie and I are gonna use we're
31:46 - basically gonna use ku dog to modify a
31:48 - game using validus and I'm gonna change
31:52 - the screen share to just show code or
31:54 - game screen just one second
31:58 - all right can you see my screen yes I
32:02 - can it's wonderful thank you so for
32:04 - those of you who are not familiar we're
32:05 - in co.org sprite lab on the left-hand
32:08 - side is where the code will be running
32:10 - where we make our game on the right hand
32:12 - side is the code for this game and
32:13 - there's all these little commands and
32:15 - here in these different drawers that we
32:17 - can look at now this code is already
32:19 - been written and I'm not going to run
32:20 - through how it works what it does is it
32:23 - creates a bunch of these little players
32:24 - called sprites on the screen so it's got
32:27 - this little alien who's a good guy and
32:29 - then these purple aliens are bad guys in
32:31 - these coins and when you run up the Run
32:34 - button all these things float around and
32:37 - you can use the cursor keys to move the
32:39 - good alien that we control you can also
32:41 - use the cursor keys on a keyboard the
32:43 - arrow keys move the good
32:46 - the good little alien but what we wanted
32:48 - to do is when they're good little alien
32:50 - catches a coin we want to count the
32:53 - score so Sophia you're gonna do that
32:55 - using valuables and so we're up here and
32:58 - it says when a coin has been gotten by
33:02 - the good alien so what is the first
33:04 - thing we want to do so if you go into
33:07 - the sprites menu and the first thing you
33:11 - want to do is remove the point so bring
33:13 - out the remove block and then take out
33:15 - or change that to the coin actually no
33:18 - don't change that because that's gonna
33:19 - remove all the coins take that out take
33:23 - out this little block and go into the
33:25 - sprite menu and choose this sprite
33:28 - because if each removed the coins but
33:31 - all of them would go but you want to
33:33 - trim this just this right and now when
33:35 - you do this
33:36 - that's right that you get will disappear
33:38 - but what we also want to do is increase
33:40 - the score and at the start of the game
33:42 - we created a valuable score we set the
33:44 - score 2-0 so now what I want you do is
33:48 - to go into the variables section and set
33:53 - the score see it's a set score to
33:57 - personally not set score to change score
34:02 - change and then clear that I and change
34:06 - it to score and so we're gonna change
34:08 - the score by one you want to change it
34:09 - by one or by two let's leave it by one
34:12 - now that's good to stuck me when I was
34:14 - the counter exactly that's just like
34:17 - here now so if you hit the Run button as
34:23 - you're going around you can control the
34:25 - little you couldn't roll this little
34:28 - thing and it's catching these little
34:29 - coins and the coins are disappearing but
34:32 - we're not seeing the score so what we
34:34 - need to do is we actually need to
34:36 - display the score on screen so so if
34:38 - they go into this area of text the
34:42 - section that says text and bring out the
34:44 - print button and in there you want to
34:49 - type score but we want to combine the
34:54 - score the word score with the value in
34:57 - score so go into texting
35:01 - and bring out this join block and
35:04 - dropped it in there and inside the print
35:06 - instead of a little score block yeah and
35:09 - then join the the word score with the
35:14 - quotes around in the Kulin and then in
35:16 - the variables bring out the value score
35:19 - so now it's going to tell the story
35:20 - which time we get one of these things so
35:23 - now if we hit run I'm gonna play this
35:25 - this time I can run around and catch the
35:27 - coins and see I got a score of one no
35:30 - score to the score of three and so on
35:32 - now I want to use a different battle it
35:35 - looks fuzzy fuzzy you can also count
35:37 - these as well what I want to do next is
35:39 - actually make it so that our player gets
35:42 - smaller and smaller and the points get
35:43 - smaller and a harder to catch as we go
35:46 - along so what we need to do is go back
35:48 - to the start of the game and create a
35:49 - new variable we're going to create a new
35:52 - variable for the size of these so go
35:54 - into variables and say set I to and
36:01 - click on the eye and say rename this
36:05 - variable so we're going to change that
36:07 - to size the bargaining is going to be
36:09 - size all right and we're gonna set size
36:15 - can you drag out the number zero and set
36:20 - the size to 50 all right so this is
36:27 - gonna be the counter for what our size
36:29 - should start to ask but what we want to
36:31 - do is now every time you capture a coin
36:34 - you want to change this change all the
36:36 - sprites to that size so now go into
36:38 - actions actions and see where it says
36:43 - set size 250 bring that out and so when
36:47 - a coin is caught change this coin size
36:50 - but instead of choosing 50 you pull out
36:52 - that 50 and then go into very ease and
36:58 - pull out the size value now size is
37:01 - going to keep this size at 50 so before
37:03 - we do that we actually want to reduce
37:05 - the size as well so go into variables
37:08 - again and save huge
37:10 - change I by and assuming keep changing I
37:15 - change the size so we want to make this
37:18 - eyes smaller it started out as 50 if we
37:21 - reduce it how much do we want to change
37:23 - it by how about by negative negative 10
37:27 - so it'll start us 50 then become 40 then
37:31 - 30 and so now we want to do this not
37:33 - just for the points let's make
37:34 - everything smaller so click this block
37:37 - and hit command C to copy it and the
37:40 - command V to paste it and I'll put that
37:44 - in there so not only the coins change
37:46 - sides make the good little alien change
37:48 - size and then click that whole block
37:51 - again and hit command C and command V
37:58 - the dark side purple aliens right now
38:01 - try they're doing again yeah you're
38:03 - doing great
38:03 - oh my God look how tiny you got you're
38:08 - getting a score it's super hard to see
38:11 - you anger is not as good as me it's so
38:22 - these aliens are now size 10 so it's
38:24 - hard to see them all right that was
38:26 - super fun
38:27 - so I'm gonna stop this for a second
38:29 - mount like all things you make on code
38:31 - over one thing we can do is we made this
38:33 - little game and we can share it out and
38:35 - if you want you can actually I'm gonna
38:37 - make this a little bit bigger you can
38:39 - actually scan what we this QR code using
38:42 - your phones and the app that Sophia made
38:45 - would then show up you just tap the
38:47 - little thing that shows up on your
38:48 - screen and that after we just made this
38:50 - on your phone to play it so if you don't
38:52 - play it right now
38:54 - but instead of doing that right now
38:56 - we're gonna send this app to you an
38:58 - email later so you can actually improve
38:59 - on it more in fact one of the things we
39:01 - wanted to do is figure out what happens
39:03 - when the good alien runs into the bad
39:05 - purple aliens that's something you can
39:08 - do now before we go into the next part
39:11 - of our episode actually want to take a
39:13 - pause and do our trivia questions so
39:16 - it's trivia attack yourself
39:19 - so fuzzy we want you to read the trivia
39:22 - question for today's audience and
39:23 - everybody of the frosted zum caulk and
39:25 - answers make sure to read the question
39:27 - and all the answers and should I answer
39:29 - it like last time what was the first
39:35 - computer that had real-world practical
39:37 - use
39:38 - was it the ENIAC the Turing machine the
39:42 - baggage the Babbage calculator or a
39:45 - human who did the job of a computer
39:49 - let's see who's the who's ahead looks
39:53 - like I'm watching the results come in
39:55 - not everybody else can see them but we
39:57 - have about half of our audience is
39:59 - already voted I don't know I don't know
40:02 - what the image of you voted and this is
40:04 - a pretty tight one this is tight I don't
40:09 - know this is tricky so almost everybody
40:11 - has voted so can we share the results of
40:13 - people's polls
40:15 - Wow everyone thinks that more most
40:18 - people think it was a human so I'll say
40:21 - straight up the Turing machine isn't
40:23 - actually a physical machine it's a
40:24 - conceptual abstraction and the Babbage
40:27 - calculator was really also theoretical
40:30 - calculator Charles Babbage came up with
40:34 - the idea of a computer but neither of
40:36 - those are actually sort of real-world
40:38 - practical uses I'm going to give you the
40:42 - answer be a screen share so just one
40:44 - second I'm going to share my screen
40:49 - the ania computer built in 1945 80 some
40:53 - 80 years ago it was 800 square 1,800
40:57 - square feet of office space it took and
41:00 - it weighed 32 tons this was the first
41:03 - modern anumana the first computer with
41:05 - practical use and used vacuum tubes
41:07 - instead of transistors and electricity's
41:10 - and today's phones like Sofia's phone
41:12 - right here have a tiny chip the size of
41:15 - a fingernail that's literally a million
41:17 - times more powerful than this first
41:19 - computer however this wasn't the first
41:22 - computer that had real-world practical
41:25 - uses the first computer as early as 1613
41:29 - a computer was somebody who did
41:32 - shooting work like math work like math
41:34 - calculations and throughout the 1800s
41:37 - and even the 1900s entire teams of
41:39 - computers often women would work on hard
41:43 - problems because we didn't have the
41:45 - machines yet to do this work and in fact
41:47 - here's pictures of some of the women who
41:50 - helped get the man on the moon it helps
41:52 - America's space program these young
41:55 - women were called computers that was
41:57 - literally their job and if you've seen
41:58 - the movie hidden figures at showcases a
42:00 - woman named Katherine Goble who's one of
42:03 - these women these women basically did
42:04 - the work of now today's modern day
42:06 - computers and I think that's interesting
42:09 - because in today's world technology is
42:12 - constantly improving in a way that
42:13 - changes jobs and human jobs are being
42:16 - replaced by machines and the computer
42:19 - itself used to be a human job long
42:21 - before we have what we what we now think
42:24 - of as computers so we're now going to
42:26 - move to the next segment in our episode
42:28 - which is using variables and apps and
42:32 - we're gonna say goodbye to Sofia
42:34 - I see that and we're gonna welcome my
42:37 - second sidekick and my son Darius hi all
42:42 - right Darius ideas so what we're gonna
42:44 - do is we're gonna make an app that helps
42:47 - us invent a story it's gonna be a tell
42:49 - me a story that is really nervous a
42:57 - little bit a little bit nervous it's
43:00 - always a little bit nervous to have a
43:01 - big audience and it's especially nervous
43:03 - when you're coding in front of the big
43:05 - audience coding by yourself is a lot
43:07 - easier because you can make mistakes and
43:09 - then you can fix your mistakes making a
43:11 - mistake in front of thousands of people
43:13 - is definitely different so we're gonna
43:16 - share screens here we're now in co.org
43:19 - app lab and what you see here on the
43:21 - left is the app we're gonna create on
43:23 - the right is the code and we've started
43:25 - some of this for you I'm gonna walk you
43:27 - through this
43:27 - we're in design mode you can see this
43:30 - app has a bunch of text inputs where you
43:32 - can enter a name an adjective a noun and
43:35 - a verb and when you click this button
43:38 - it's not doesn't do anything yet because
43:40 - we haven't written the code for it but
43:41 - we would like it to do
43:43 - is to store all this information just
43:46 - like yara asked the valuables to
43:48 - remember the names of fruits we want the
43:50 - this app to remember this information
43:52 - and then to switch to screen two and to
43:55 - fill in those different words to finish
43:58 - this sentence to make a story so this
44:01 - here is going to be the name and this
44:03 - year is going to be an adjective and
44:04 - this year it's going to be a noun and so
44:06 - on so let's go to code mode and write
44:10 - the code of what happens when you click
44:12 - this button let's remember the
44:14 - information here using variables fuzzy
44:17 - will you be able to help us doing this
44:19 - absolutely
44:20 - alright so darius what i want you to do
44:23 - is if you look here there's an on event
44:25 - block is what happens when the story
44:28 - button gets clicked and what we want to
44:30 - do is get the text from these things i
44:32 - store them in baggies and if you look up
44:34 - top we already have created the values
44:36 - for the main the adjective the mound etc
44:39 - so what i want you to do is to go under
44:41 - the values category of demands and drag
44:45 - out the x equals but instead of x change
44:52 - it to your name and you have a small
44:56 - type of your name and so the value to
45:01 - put a name go into your controls and you
45:05 - want to get the value in the text editor
45:07 - so use the get text block and you want
45:12 - to do get text the main input alright so
45:20 - what that's going to do is store that
45:21 - into that valuable and then what we want
45:23 - to do this is what's happening when the
45:24 - tell me your story button is clicked so
45:26 - what we want to do next is then it's
45:28 - change the screen so go into the blocks
45:31 - here know and and find this set screen
45:34 - button it's near the very bottom right
45:41 - there the set screen and pull that up
45:44 - and now we're going to change screens at
45:46 - screen too and just to remember what
45:48 - screen to is over here you can click to
45:51 - in design mode to change screen to so
45:54 - that's what screen to its and i go back
45:55 - to
45:56 - right now once we change screen to
46:00 - screen - we can set the text so this
46:03 - text isn't the dispersed label up here
46:04 - if you can move your mouse above this
46:06 - these sort of question marks that's
46:07 - where the name output is going to go so
46:10 - go up and find the set text block it's
46:14 - at the top you're doing great date and
46:20 - set the text for name output right now
46:25 - it's gonna fill it up with the word text
46:27 - but we don't want to set the name output
46:29 - to the text we want to use it about and
46:32 - our variables let's see what should we
46:33 - put over there for the variable yeah
46:37 - this text here or the text I would say
46:42 - funny no we want to change it to what we
46:46 - stored in the variable so we're gonna
46:48 - use your name which was the value that
46:51 - we remembered oh I see alright so now
46:56 - let's run this and see how it works it's
47:02 - okay now hit run so now it's gonna say
47:04 - let's come up with a story and so we're
47:07 - gonna enter a name fuzzy pickles random
47:09 - name for us random name
47:11 - oh yeah pick darius darius that wasn't
47:14 - very random
47:15 - now click tell me a story and so you can
47:18 - see it says one fine day darius walk
47:20 - into a blank blank and blank over a
47:23 - blank it was a truly great day so that's
47:26 - our first step of remembering what
47:29 - darius entered but we need to do the
47:31 - rest of it so we're not going to do this
47:34 - all typing in the code right now we've
47:37 - actually written the lines to copy
47:39 - seduce click show text when you click
47:42 - show text you see all this code of
47:44 - JavaScript instead of blocks and if you
47:46 - go to the very bottom you see where it
47:48 - has all these adjectives already made
47:50 - the adjectives and nouns and all these
47:52 - get text blocks can you select all of
47:54 - that and then cut it this looks like
47:57 - really hard it looks like what my code
48:01 - yes paste it there and then go down to
48:03 - the bottom again and then all these set
48:06 - texts
48:08 - put it again so fuzzy yeah this what
48:12 - we're doing right now is no longer like
48:14 - dragging and dropping blocks it's
48:16 - dragging it's literally and how real
48:18 - coders work in new texts but one thing
48:21 - you can notify Z is even though we're
48:23 - we're here you can still drag and drop
48:25 - blocks into here Wow
48:29 - turns out to flex that's kind of neat
48:32 - and then once we're done we can change
48:35 - the back to block mode and everything we
48:37 - copied and pasted is back into blocks
48:39 - and so now and I'm going to close this
48:43 - so you can see it more easily so what we
48:45 - did now is when the story button is
48:47 - clicked we collect just like Yara asked
48:51 - Samuel to remember a banana and so in
48:53 - soda a number of here we're going to
48:55 - change these variables your name is
48:57 - going to remember what's in the main
48:58 - input and a man and what's the name of
49:00 - this spiral each of these virals
49:02 - remembers each of these things here so
49:05 - when we change the screen when we change
49:08 - the screen in each of these labels we
49:10 - can set text and we get the values in
49:13 - the baggages Siderius can you run this
49:15 - and now we're going to try it out
49:17 - so let's now come up with this dinner so
49:20 - why don't you now come up with a name
49:22 - pick a random one like me you wanna do

49:37 - fun yeah I'll go with funny like I was
49:39 - putting before funny yeah
49:43 - which rhymes with fuzzy it rhymes with
49:46 - fuzzy and then for the third so for the
49:52 - third for the second adjective well

51:21 - sneezed and then tell me a story so one
51:31 - fine day buzz if you want to read it for
51:33 - us sure but I'm gonna get all emotional
51:36 - this is a story my mom used to read to
51:38 - me when I was a baby
51:40 - one fine day Steve walked into a funny
51:44 - arcade and sneezed over a clumsy puppy
51:47 - it was truly a great day I remember it
51:51 - like yesterday when she used to read
51:52 - this to me that's a wonderful story and

52:02 - watching this today so Wow so she'll
52:05 - confirm this confirm this so thank you
52:09 - so much fuzzy for helping us with this
52:11 - app and what we're gonna do by the way
52:13 - is you're gonna get an email with this
52:14 - app so you can improve on it yourself so
52:16 - you can make multiple stories there's
52:18 - multiple changes you can make to it so
52:21 - for example you can take out this very
52:23 - last line and replace it with another
52:25 - variable you can make a second story
52:27 - that uses the same inputs and you can
52:29 - let their user to click between the two
52:31 - story
52:31 - you can make a longer story you gonna
52:34 - have this app I'm not gonna use the QR
52:35 - code to share it we'll send it to via
52:37 - email I want to then also get some
52:41 - chance for the audience questions that
52:43 - people submitted for fuzzy so Akira
52:45 - our producer is gonna join up again and
52:47 - then share the questions for fuzzy at
52:50 - this point I am an expert question asker
52:53 - overlayer I'd like to think so fuzzy
52:56 - this one is from Caitlin sea in Wyoming
52:58 - she said what's at max have you had in
53:00 - your career and how did you overcome
53:01 - them what setback that's a great
53:04 - question
53:06 - setbacks I wouldn't say it's setbacks
53:08 - because I always learn from every single
53:11 - experience that I have and it's been
53:13 - literally just you know making sure that
53:17 - I've learned over time that I do much
53:20 - better when I really enjoy what I work
53:22 - on and I've learned that like trying
53:25 - different experiences and if it's not
53:27 - working out going to the next one but
53:30 - using the last one as a learning
53:32 - experience is really important so when I
53:34 - was selling life insurance realizing
53:37 - that I didn't necessarily I wasn't as
53:39 - good at selling but I still expand I
53:42 - learned a lot from it and then I moved
53:44 - on to the next thing so you're always
53:46 - just learning and trying new things and
53:49 - you just can't give up thank you so much
53:52 - buzzy and this next question is for both
53:54 - you Hadi and fuzzy this is from Alice in
53:58 - Zambia she said universities are
54:00 - expensive so how can I learn computer
54:02 - science without a university education
54:04 - so judging by the question I'm assuming
54:06 - she's a bit further along and so if you
54:08 - both could speak to how can she learn
54:10 - the basics and also how can she continue
54:12 - to grow as she reached reaches those
54:14 - more advanced stages how do you want to
54:17 - take this or I can take it I can take it
54:20 - all though Fuzzy's a perfect example of
54:22 - somebody who's had an incredible career
54:23 - creating and creating google
54:25 - spreadsheets and even Google Docs and
54:27 - Google Drive there's being used by over
54:29 - a billion users and he never went to a
54:32 - university to learn computer science he
54:33 - basically taught himself coding and so
54:36 - there's lots and lots of people that
54:38 - teach yourself I also taught myself when
54:40 - I was much younger living in Iran
54:43 - but when I tell myself it wasn't nearly
54:45 - as easy you needed to use books and
54:48 - learning computer programming as part
54:49 - today if you use code org as a beginner
54:52 - you can learn all the stuff that we were
54:54 - showing you you can use code or to
54:57 - basically learn from our lessons that
54:59 - guide you through them and you can also
55:00 - get full computer science university
55:04 - level computer science classes online as
55:06 - well and in fact if you visit code.org
55:08 - we link to some of the best university
55:10 - computer science classes such as cs50 at
55:13 - Harvard which I suspect is their class a
55:16 - Jana she D is going to take when one of
55:19 - either whether junior year senior year
55:21 - starts and it's a year-long computer
55:23 - science class that you could pay tens of
55:25 - thousands of dollars to go to Harvard to
55:27 - take that class or you can take it
55:28 - online besides that there's many other
55:30 - online university classes that you can
55:32 - see links to from the code.org websites
55:35 - and if you sign up on co.org slash break
55:38 - for a mailing list you'll actually will
55:40 - link that in our weekly email after this
55:43 - episode oh wow just to expand on that
55:46 - the best way to learn is to have a
55:48 - project in mind so I love the fact that
55:50 - when you go on code or you're actually
55:52 - building something and learning it's
55:54 - much better than reading a book whenever
55:56 - I've done I've learned I in the past I
55:59 - would get all sorts of books and then I
56:01 - would try to use it to build something
56:03 - exactly and we're so lucky we've had
56:06 - students now have created 80 million
56:08 - projects on code.org in just the last
56:10 - two years so you won't be alone so we're
56:13 - reaching the end of our time whether the
56:15 - fun doesn't stop here we're gonna send
56:17 - you all an email within the next hour
56:18 - with all of our weekly challenges if
56:20 - you're not on our email list go to code
56:22 - org slash break and sign up and for this
56:26 - week's challenges you're first gonna get
56:28 - some practice you're gonna practice
56:29 - variables to make a little bee that goes
56:32 - and fetches honey and for our older
56:34 - students there's some variable puzzles
56:36 - that you can do an app lab and then for
56:38 - this week's challenge you can either
56:39 - modify the alien coin game that Sophia
56:42 - made or if you can add features to a
56:44 - storyteller app that there is made or do
56:46 - both of those and when you finish share
56:49 - with your parents if you have social
56:51 - media you can ask them to share the app
56:53 - on social media with hashtag go break or
56:55 - you can email it to us and
56:57 - that will pick two of the best ones that
56:59 - you submit to highlight them and invite
57:00 - them on our show next week and for
57:02 - parents our activities each week include
57:05 - activities that students can do on a
57:06 - mobile phone if you don't have a
57:07 - computer or even an unplugged activity
57:09 - for students who don't have even a
57:11 - device of any sort so please sign up for
57:14 - our mailing list at code.org slash break
57:17 - and lastly before we say goodbye I want
57:21 - to share next week's special guests
57:23 - which I'm very excited about we have two
57:25 - special guests next week
