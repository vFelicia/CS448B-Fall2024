00:28 - confidence computer science is
00:30 - fundamental for children of the Future
00:33 - these skills are as fundamental as
00:35 - learning arithmetic or algebra because
00:37 - Computing will touch every field job or
00:40 - area of Life coding should be taught in
00:43 - the early ages because children will
00:45 - pick it up and can do much better later
00:48 - learning computer science helps uh gets
00:50 - things smart it helps them to learn and
00:53 - understand new ideas which can help them
00:55 - to create Solutions which they want
00:57 - computers work for everyone whoever you
01:00 - are wherever you are whatever your
01:03 - background across the length and breadth
01:05 - of India help us create an inclusive
01:08 - future for everyone kids you all like
01:11 - phones so don't just use phones program
01:15 - them that's what you can do with the
01:18 - power of Computer Science
01:20 - Education coding is universal language
01:23 - it is not English French Spanish Canada
01:27 - Hindi if you want to really talk to each
01:30 - other in the global market today it is
01:33 - through coding coding is extremely
01:35 - essential in the future everything that
01:38 - we do will be done by computers and we
01:40 - need to teach the computer to how to do
01:44 - different things hence we need computer
01:47 - science with computer science you can
01:49 - build useful Tech that's human Centric
01:53 - that is good for all of us and the
01:55 - planet no
01:57 - matter where you are
