00:00 - Great!
00:00 - We've caught a codfish!
00:02 - Did you know if you feed a codfish to a dolphin,
the dolphin will guide you to a shipwreck
00:07 - where there may be treasure?
00:09 - We must be getting closer.
00:11 - The next set of puzzles are bound to be trickier,
so we better learn some more coding skills.
00:17 - What's this?
00:18 - A cave?
00:19 - Welcome, adventurers!
00:21 - My name is Squid.
00:22 - I noticed you were using the same set of commands
over and over in some of the last puzzles.
00:28 - Must've been a bit tiresome.
00:29 - Do you ever wish you had a way to do something
over and over again like, you know,
00:33 - washing dishes or brushing your teeth 
without getting tired or bored?
00:37 - That would be nice.
00:39 - Computers are really good at doing the same
thing over and over again using coding loops.
00:45 - When you want your program to do the same
instructions many times, you can use a loop!
00:49 - The loop contains instructions with the command
to repeat until goal.
00:54 - Once your program starts a repeat until goal
loop, it will keep reading the instructions
00:59 - inside until it gets to the goal.
01:01 - Try this for yourself!
01:03 - Place the commands you want to repeat inside
the repeat until goal block,
01:07 - click run, and watch it go!
01:12 - Well, that was a little weird.
01:14 - Who knew squids could code?
01:16 - I didn't even think they had fingers.
01:18 - So now we know about loops.
01:20 - Let's use them to bag us some more treasure.
