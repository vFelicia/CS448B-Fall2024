00:00 - if you'd like to make your own game it's
00:02 - really easy all you need are just a few
00:04 - basics of programming and you can start
00:06 - playing a game that you
00:08 - created do you have a favorite video
00:11 - game we're going to take one step
00:13 - towards creating games just like that
00:15 - using
00:16 - playlab good games have a story and
00:19 - every story has actors actors that do
00:22 - things like speak move interact with
00:24 - each other maybe even score points based
00:27 - on the rules of the game today we be
00:30 - learning how to do all of these things
00:31 - one by one with fun actors and then
00:34 - build a game from scratch that can be
00:35 - shared and played on a
00:37 - phone your screen is split into three
00:40 - main parts on the left is the game Space
00:43 - where your program will run the
00:45 - instructions for each level are written
00:47 - below this middle area is the toolbx and
00:50 - each of these blocks is a piece of
00:53 - code the white space on the right is
00:55 - called the workspace and this is where
00:57 - we'll build our
00:58 - program to start off you'll need to link
01:01 - your blocks to the orange when run block
01:04 - you can link multiple blocks together by
01:06 - dragging them out until you see the
01:07 - yellow line and then they'll snapped
01:09 - together in this first puzzle we'll make
01:12 - the actor Say Something by linking the
01:14 - say block to the when run block and
01:16 - typing in your
01:18 - message once you have your blocks in
01:20 - place hit the Run button to see what you
01:24 - programmed get started and by the end
01:26 - you'll be able to create your own game
01:28 - with all kinds of players that can
01:30 - interact score points throw things and
01:33 - vanish each other it's all up to
01:38 - you
