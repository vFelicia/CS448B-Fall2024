00:03 - understanding coding is a weapon it's
00:08 - like a superpower is better than a
00:11 - superpower hi I'm Cari I work in fashion
00:15 - but I also consider myself a student I'm
00:18 - fascinated by understanding how things
00:20 - work I wanted to learn how the world of
00:22 - technology is built so I started to
00:25 - learn how to code in my spare time
00:27 - because it wasn't offered to me as a
00:29 - class when I was in school I grew up in
00:31 - a house with three sisters and all four
00:33 - of us were never encouraged to learn how
00:37 - to code and that's the one thing that I
00:40 - wish someone would have
00:42 - said just take one class I always
00:45 - thought I would be following My Father's
00:48 - Footsteps and going to Medicine my dad's
00:50 - a doctor and I love math I ended up
00:52 - having a career in fashion you know
00:54 - there's not much math that I use in my
00:56 - day-to-day life for my work but I am
01:01 - fascinated by by Computer Sciences by
01:05 - understanding programming by
01:07 - understanding how things are built I
01:09 - happen to be a closeted super
01:13 - nerd so I personally have begun learning
01:16 - how to program on my own because
01:19 - programming is the language of the
01:22 - future and of now I wish I would have
01:24 - started learning at 13 but it doesn't
01:27 - matter how old you are you can always
01:29 - start learning jump into it learn just
01:33 - try and take one class give it one hour
01:36 - it's amazing what you can learn in 1
01:38 - hour it's important to break that stigma
01:41 - of thinking that it's not cool to be
01:45 - smart if you
01:46 - can understand much less speak code you
01:51 - can build
01:54 - anything by the way the games are so
01:57 - much fun I spend so much time like
02:00 - playing with the different games that
02:01 - are probably targeted to like 12 year
02:03 - olds
