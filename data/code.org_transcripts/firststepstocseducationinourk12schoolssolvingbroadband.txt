03:44 - and next slide
03:48 - the latest data reveals that disparities
03:50 - still exist for who have access to
03:53 - computer science education the rapid
03:55 - growth in computer science courses
03:57 - offerings in the last few years is
03:59 - encouraging but despite the growth
04:02 - growth roughly half of all high schools
04:04 - still lack a single course
04:06 - given the significance of computing in
04:09 - today's society the work of the computer
04:11 - science education movement movement must
04:14 - continue in earnest
04:16 - next slide please
04:21 - and only 59 of native students attend a
04:24 - high school that offers foundational
04:26 - computer science or a school that offers
04:28 - foundational computer science
04:31 - and next slide although we've reached a
04:33 - milestone of more than half 51 percent
04:35 - of high schools offering cs only 20
04:37 - percent of high schools are located on

07:00 - without further ado i'd like to turn it
07:02 - over to andrea
07:07 - thanks jackie
07:10 - chin oh yeah andrea olsen connie look

07:19 - i am a member of the i own band of miwok
07:21 - indians
07:22 - and also the executive director at
07:24 - natives in tech and i do want to thank
07:27 - code.org for having me
07:28 - and partnering on this summit
07:32 - with natives in tech
07:33 - so with that
07:35 - i'll touch a little bit about
07:37 - a touch on my pathway finding my pathway
07:40 - into tech
07:43 - and really want to emphasize that you
07:44 - know
07:45 - growing up i didn't have access to
07:48 - computing um i will date myself a little
07:50 - bit
07:51 - but in high school and through
07:53 - elementary school you know we
07:56 - technology just wasn't available it was
07:58 - in the process of being
08:01 - um
08:03 - sorry
08:04 - built um so my career in um cs didn't
08:08 - start until i
08:09 - got into college um
08:14 - and it has been a winding road
08:17 - so go ahead next slide
08:20 - my experience started when i went back
08:21 - to school um
08:24 - university to get my bachelor's in
08:27 - education
08:28 - and i wound up taking a computer science
08:30 - class um for one of the required courses
08:33 - and just found a passion a passion for
08:36 - building the technology and all the
08:38 - things that it could potentially do for
08:41 - myself my tribe accessibility um
08:45 - the greatest
08:47 - thing that i wanted to accomplish was
08:50 - language preservation
08:51 - and
08:52 - just saw an adore opening for this
08:55 - opportunity
08:58 - to utilize technology to preserve
09:00 - language
09:01 - um
09:04 - go ahead next slide
09:06 - so i've had to navigate this space alone
09:09 - and i know that there are so many
09:10 - opportunities and
09:12 - pathways into different areas of tech
09:14 - and it was really important to me to
09:16 - highlight
09:17 - the people who are responsible for where
09:19 - i am today um i wouldn't have found the
09:22 - these opportunities if it weren't for
09:25 - these found these founding mentors
09:28 - um the first four doctor almadena conrad
09:31 - dr ellen spurtus dr susan wang doctor um
09:35 - and rose robinson
09:37 - have really set the stage for me um to
09:40 - find my passion in technology and to do
09:43 - the work to
09:45 - that really speaks to me and i think
09:47 - that's important now in early education
09:51 - and creating accessible
09:53 - opportunities for k through 12
09:57 - cs
09:58 - education
09:59 - so that
10:00 - it doesn't come later in life where
10:03 - it's harder to navigate these spaces and
10:06 - they can learn the skills
10:08 - to find mentorship and opportunities to
10:11 - get involved and to build and to grow
10:13 - and thrive
10:14 - go ahead next slide
10:17 - so when i first got into tech um
10:21 - this was one of my passion projects you
10:24 - know i touched a little bit on language
10:27 - endangerment and what i wanted to do was
10:29 - build language preservation
10:31 - so rose robinson
10:34 - really
10:36 - eliminated a pathway for me and
10:38 - introduced me to some folks where they
10:40 - were looking to create a course for
10:44 - creating multi-screen apps and teaching
10:46 - how to build multi-screen apps for
10:48 - mobile development and they wanted to
10:50 - use language content
10:52 - and in the process i was building a
10:54 - language app for my tribe and for my
10:56 - dialect and so
10:59 - we collaborated
11:01 - i collaborated with google and udacity
11:04 - to build
11:06 - this course with them but also to build
11:08 - an app and scale out
11:10 - a language
11:12 - and language access to teach
11:14 - because there are only there is only one
11:17 - remaining native fluent language speaker
11:20 - in my tribe um at the time we had three
11:24 - we now
11:25 - um
11:26 - only have one so we are critically
11:28 - endangered of losing our language and
11:31 - this is just something that i am really
11:32 - passionate about and hope that i can see
11:34 - other
11:35 - um
11:37 - youth and future students of cs ed
11:40 - learning about and
11:41 - working on to
11:43 - make an impact in their communities
11:46 - go ahead next slide
11:48 - so with that
11:49 - um
11:50 - now is the time for change um there is
11:53 - just a surgeon of work surgeons of work
11:55 - being done you know i started out
11:57 - working on my language preservation but
12:00 - so many other people and
12:03 - indigenous communities are as well
12:06 - and
12:07 - this is where we just need
12:10 - more access more tools availability
12:12 - mentors visibility
12:15 - for our youth and for folks who are
12:18 - interested in getting into tech or just
12:20 - don't even know the opportunities that
12:21 - can come from it
12:23 - so i am here to be a support and a
12:26 - resource you know we talked about my
12:28 - volunteer opportunity my volunteer
12:30 - experience
12:32 - um with these organizations
12:34 - being at asus um
12:36 - i'm also on i'm on the board of
12:38 - directors as well as their community
12:42 - or sorry my education committee
12:44 - and
12:45 - i just love spreading the news about
12:48 - their education
12:50 - camps and
12:51 - opportunities for not only the students
12:54 - but for the educators as well
12:57 - um so with that go ahead next slide
13:00 - um i would like to share a little bit
13:02 - about how you can get involved or in
13:04 - contact with natives in tech
13:07 - our
13:08 - conference annual conference is starting
13:10 - tomorrow kicking off with a

17:02 - i'm happy and honored to be invited
17:05 - and thankful and appreciative that you

17:10 - today because i know how busy we are
17:12 - just a special shout out to those in new
17:14 - mexico on the call as well as all of the
17:17 - educators i know what we've all been
17:19 - going through through kovid
17:21 - and the fact that you are doing going
17:24 - above and beyond by participating
17:27 - in the precious moments of your day
17:30 - really speaks to the commitment to the
17:31 - topic and all the native educators out
17:34 - there you know double that with you know
17:36 - your pioneering efforts to help our
17:38 - communities participate
17:40 - um in the stem and steam um
17:44 - opportunities for our youth which are
17:46 - going to have critical long-term impacts
17:48 - and it's not going to be an overnight
17:49 - thing but i know that we're doing the
17:51 - right thing by focusing on this topic
17:54 - and in these conversations
17:56 - next slide please
17:58 - so the santa fe indian school we've
18:00 - existed in santa fe new mexico as an off
18:02 - reservation boarding school since 1890.
18:05 - we served the 19 pueblos of new mexico's
18:07 - and the navajo and apache tribes
18:10 - we're a high school in the middle school
18:13 - and we
18:14 - mainly serve
18:17 - pueblo students
18:19 - and
18:20 - two-thirds of our students stay with us
18:21 - on campus five days a week we also have
18:24 - six bus lines coming in from three
18:26 - northern and three southern pueblos
18:29 - and then most students go home and for
18:31 - the weekend and that's obviously
18:33 - important for them to maintain their
18:35 - family and community connections despite
18:37 - the fact that
18:39 - they're with us in santa fe for for a
18:42 - majority of the week
18:44 - our school i mentioned was founded in
18:45 - 1890 it was a federal boarding school
18:48 - and i know we've heard about those in
18:49 - the news a lot
18:50 - and you know with respect to language
18:52 - and culture
18:54 - there were good times and there were bad
18:55 - times and those directly
18:58 - mirror
19:00 - federal indian policy you know the and
19:02 - what was going on at a policy level
19:04 - nationally not what was going on or
19:06 - should be going on with the best
19:08 - interests of natives and the education
19:11 - of our youth
19:13 - um in
19:14 - 1975 i believe it was the um there was a
19:18 - law that was enacted
19:19 - the um the self-determination indian
19:22 - self-determination and education
19:24 - assistance act and that enabled schools
19:27 - bureau of indian education or beer of
19:29 - indian affairs schools at that time to
19:31 - contract operations away from the
19:33 - federal government so what that means
19:35 - for us is that the 19 pueblos who were
19:39 - one of the first to contract under that
19:41 - federal law
19:42 - um
19:43 - our leaders our governors came together
19:45 - and were very intentional that they
19:48 - wanted
19:49 - to regain control over the future of
19:51 - pueblo people
19:53 - by taking control over the education of
19:55 - the youth so at that time our school
19:58 - went under tribal control and we became
20:02 - able to create the culturally responsive
20:04 - curriculum to look into our community
20:07 - for that expertise and to bring that
20:10 - into the classroom and to
20:12 - prioritize the topics that would create
20:16 - opportunities for our students and
20:17 - professional
20:19 - abilities that they could bring back
20:21 - into community to increase the community
20:23 - well-being
20:24 - so
20:25 - there wasn't a lot of technology back
20:27 - then obviously
20:29 - but
20:30 - there's always been a high degree of
20:34 - priority on language
20:36 - and as we just heard with others
20:39 - you know with andrea and her her example
20:42 - she's not alone you know native
20:44 - languages internationally globally are
20:47 - not in a very healthy state
20:49 - and we can talk about that at another
20:51 - time
20:53 - but in new mexico
20:55 - you know there's a lot of at-risk and
20:57 - endangered languages and when we as a
21:00 - school here from our tribal leadership
21:02 - they tell us that that is their top
21:05 - priority it's not always been that they
21:07 - wanted a school
21:08 - to solve that or to address the issue
21:11 - it's always better to speak at home in
21:13 - family in community but in the times
21:16 - we're in that's not always possible
21:19 - some tribes feel more comfortable using
21:21 - technology than others but again it's a
21:24 - tool that we have in our tool kit
21:27 - that if we harness we can use it to
21:30 - really solve some of our own community
21:33 - priorities such as language
21:34 - revitalization
21:36 - one of the challenges that we have
21:38 - in in the pueblo languages
21:41 - is that they're not written down they're
21:43 - only oral
21:45 - so when we're developing
21:47 - um you know
21:49 - you can't read and write in the book
21:52 - how can you
21:53 - facilitate the instruction
21:55 - well you can facilitate instruction
21:58 - great you know like we're doing right
22:00 - now on the screen so it's like what are
22:02 - the new opportunities we have when we
22:04 - think of technology in this space for
22:06 - real-time instruction and we know our
22:08 - students want it you can see from a
22:10 - student survey back in about 2015 that
22:13 - the overwhelming number of students want
22:16 - to speak their languages next slide
22:18 - please
22:21 - so the possibilities so this was
22:24 - taking those native language classes
22:27 - that had been happening in pueblo um in
22:30 - the summer time
22:31 - um
22:32 - more into a school setting and this is a
22:35 - recent trend in new mexico and recent
22:38 - being well i don't know about you guys
22:39 - but my sense of time has been all messed
22:41 - up during covid but at least in the last
22:44 - couple decades or so you know
22:48 - more of an acceptability to teach it in
22:50 - in the schools but teaching in community
22:53 - is different from teaching in schools
22:54 - the pedagogy is different and it needs
22:57 - to be developed so you have this effort
22:59 - to develop the curriculum
23:01 - so when we introduce technology into
23:03 - that conversation the two biggest
23:05 - possibilities for me was with multimedia
23:08 - and then with video conferencing so we
23:11 - have these black and white drawings of
23:12 - oral uh oral tradition that i know my
23:15 - kids used as they were learning their
23:17 - languages in the summer
23:19 - and and they were they're they're fine
23:21 - you know they're great and that they
23:23 - would come back every summer and get a
23:25 - little bit more
23:26 - um by the time you get to the senior you
23:29 - know high school there's been like a
23:31 - cycling of some of that content and the
23:34 - student engagement isn't as strong as
23:36 - with the younger students so that's kind
23:38 - of
23:39 - something that i think we wanted to
23:40 - address
23:42 - and so i was thinking i was like okay
23:44 - well what if we animate
23:46 - those black and white drawings why don't
23:49 - we tell the story and have them play the
23:51 - video that's going to do two things
23:53 - because the older students who are kind
23:56 - of um
23:58 - a little bit wearing
23:59 - uh
24:00 - you know tired of the repetitive content
24:03 - they can get engaged with the tech
24:05 - skills of creating the animations and
24:08 - increase their
24:09 - speaking and hearing of the language
24:11 - through that process and then the
24:12 - younger kids they inherit the content
24:15 - and they use they use that in their
24:17 - spongebob time where they're
24:19 - strengthening their language skills and
24:21 - then they're going to bring more
24:22 - language when they're older students and
24:24 - they're creating the content so what we
24:26 - i would like to believe is that we're
24:28 - going to see this spiral of language and
24:30 - digital digital literacy and media go
24:33 - together so that's my that was my
24:35 - long-term vision you know at that time
24:38 - and then you know the use of video
24:39 - conferencing no brainer you know if we
24:42 - can't write our language we can talk
24:44 - back to home community right here using
24:46 - zoom i mean it wasn't such a obvious
24:49 - solution you know when we had the great
24:51 - idea but it was it's clearly something
24:54 - that could be very powerful
24:57 - not just to connect to um a teacher or
25:00 - for a school you know when the zuni
25:02 - teacher calls in sick and you're in
25:04 - santa fe you can't
25:06 - easily find a replacement and then the
25:08 - students might watch a video during that
25:10 - classroom right well let's keep that
25:12 - instruction going by having that
25:14 - resource or that teacher available back
25:16 - in zuni or tribal leadership or a parent
25:19 - or an artist that can show you know the
25:22 - forming of you know something that
25:24 - they're making
25:25 - so bridging back to community through
25:27 - video conferencing is an amazing
25:29 - opportunity that we have
25:31 - in the native language instruction
25:34 - next slide please
25:35 - so this is the only problem
25:38 - our communities are too slow they didn't
25:40 - have internet we couldn't actually talk
25:42 - to them
25:44 - and the way that that was abruptly
25:46 - realized was that essentially when we
25:50 - solved the problem in santa fe so
25:52 - starting about 2008 2009 in downtown
25:56 - albuquerque santa fe the capital of new
25:58 - mexico you cannot get high-speed
26:00 - internet that was fiber optic based
26:02 - there were some ethernet circuits that
26:04 - were like 50 megs or something that were
26:06 - very expensive but we also struggled
26:09 - so that's when i really became engaged
26:11 - in the broadband community because
26:15 - i had to actually it was my job i was
26:17 - i.t director they're like bringing more
26:19 - internet so i'm out there you know
26:21 - scrounging for it and what i ended up
26:24 - doing is meeting the community the wide
26:26 - area network community um the broadband
26:29 - community whoever you like to call it
26:31 - and bringing in a high-speed circuit
26:32 - into
26:33 - new mexico i mean into santa fe and the
26:35 - school and then we turned around to the
26:38 - communities and said hey we have this
26:39 - internet we're super fast let's do this
26:41 - awesome stuff with it
26:43 - and there was just violence and like i
26:45 - said they were too slow to talk back
26:47 - and there's there's reasons for that and
26:49 - anybody out there in rural in urban in
26:52 - an urban desert will know that you don't
26:55 - have choices that are fast or affordable
26:58 - and that's because the market the
26:59 - carriers
27:00 - haven't built out their networks to
27:02 - provide us with those choices
27:05 - and that's just the reason that we're
27:07 - under connected um and
27:10 - on where we're starting from
27:12 - next slide please
27:16 - so we have some momentum going with the
27:18 - use of technology and then like
27:20 - everybody else covid you know just
27:24 - um
27:25 - just
27:26 - eradicates the any previous memory all
27:29 - we're doing now is kobit we're going
27:31 - into remote learning i think we went
27:33 - into remote learning on march maybe 20th
27:36 - of 2020 i went into a director's meeting
27:39 - we were going in for a long going out
27:41 - for a long weekend there was a student
27:43 - that was going to fly out of state and
27:45 - we're like should we allow that student
27:47 - back in to school you know that's a kind
27:50 - of a high risk situation with the
27:52 - transmission of the virus
27:54 - and an hour later we closed school
27:56 - indefinitely so we packed them up we
27:59 - found
28:01 - all the chromebooks that we had in stock
28:02 - and sent them home for what we would
28:05 - then realize was the rest of of the
28:07 - school year
28:08 - um
28:09 - like many schools we um
28:13 - needed to assess you know their level of
28:15 - connectivity
28:17 - um and so we conducted a survey and that
28:20 - was really very informative to not just
28:22 - get us through coven but really tell us
28:25 - where we were in indian country
28:27 - and what options we had to connect our
28:30 - students in home
28:32 - so rural
28:34 - indian lands are the least connected in
28:36 - the country that's just a known fact the
28:39 - fcc reports that you know year after
28:41 - year
28:42 - they say there's improvements and there
28:45 - are
28:45 - but probably not quite to the amount
28:48 - that are reported right now because of
28:49 - certain data and reporting issues but as
28:52 - i mentioned we're we serve tribes
28:54 - statewide so when we send our kids home
28:56 - we sent them to 22 rural tribal lands so
28:59 - therefore they have to be some of the
29:00 - least connected places in america
29:03 - and solving for each one
29:06 - was unique they don't all have the same
29:08 - solution because they don't have the
29:09 - same options they don't have the same
29:10 - geography the same mountains and valleys
29:12 - and mesas that we gotta work around
29:15 - so that was our focus going into covid
29:18 - um
29:19 - we
29:20 - had to get obviously um very creative um
29:24 - what we found out though in this survey
29:26 - and
29:27 - note to self if you're going to
29:29 - administer an internet survey on lack of
29:32 - connectivity do not do it over the
29:34 - internet
29:36 - um we called everybody and we've
29:40 - we paid our staff to find each and every
29:42 - santa fe indian school family to find
29:44 - out what what their internet's
29:46 - connectivity status was and what we
29:48 - found was that 89 of them
29:51 - did not have adequate internet that met
29:53 - the fcc's performance benchmark of 25
29:56 - megabits down and three megabits up
29:58 - to um
30:00 - facilitate this video conferencing
30:02 - experience we have now um adequately
30:06 - that meant that and and i and only 23 of
30:09 - our staff did right
30:11 - uh nonetheless we know that our students
30:14 - um persevere and they will find the
30:16 - internet when they want the internet and
30:18 - we found that pre-covet how they were
30:20 - doing that was prepaid um
30:23 - phone plans
30:25 - you know you when a family had
30:26 - disposable income you could go and buy
30:29 - you know a number of them at best buy or
30:32 - walmart and then they would have the
30:34 - internet for you know one to three
30:36 - months and then their phone number would
30:38 - change too which is frustrating and then
30:39 - it would go away it's very expensive
30:43 - very
30:44 - data caps but it was it's very common um
30:47 - and i that's not a surprise i'm sure
30:49 - many people on the phone
30:51 - 27 percent percent of them were using
30:53 - public wi-fi that means they were going
30:55 - to town mcdonald's um starbucks
30:58 - 21 were using their tribal libraries
31:00 - these are critical facilities in our
31:01 - communities and when the homes didn't
31:03 - have internet and when those homes
31:06 - didn't even really have computers the
31:07 - students were going to the libraries
31:09 - after school
31:10 - or they would go to relatives
31:13 - homes or or work
31:15 - so that was
31:16 - that was
31:17 - fine or that was
31:19 - again the way it was and we were getting
31:22 - by
31:23 - so
31:25 - on the other hand enter covet again or
31:28 - and we know that
31:31 - only 11 of our students can connect
31:34 - we were already the least connected in
31:35 - the united states we need the internet
31:37 - more than ever and all those internet
31:39 - lifelines were just cut off because
31:43 - what our tribal leadership did and what
31:45 - they needed to do and what we i thank
31:47 - them every day for doing
31:49 - is constructing checkpoints which
31:50 - prevented people from entering and
31:52 - leaving the pueblo nations and really
31:55 - many most of the tribal nations
31:57 - through covet
31:59 - but what that meant was is they couldn't
32:01 - go to the tribal library those closed um
32:03 - many left the parking lot wi-fi on which
32:06 - was great but then there were social
32:08 - gathering rules that maybe prevented
32:10 - them from actually going to the parking
32:12 - lot
32:13 - they could no longer leave the pueblo to
32:14 - go to mcdonald's or starbucks
32:17 - um
32:18 - the bus i spent most like three months
32:20 - working with a national non-profit
32:22 - called itdrc in our state public
32:24 - education department installing hundreds
32:26 - of public wi-fi
32:29 - locations
32:30 - across all of new mexico tribal lands
32:33 - and those are great except that when you
32:34 - have bus wi-fi and you don't have a tent
32:37 - in the shade and you're under the sun in
32:39 - the desert that's not a great learning
32:41 - environment and so they were a necessary
32:43 - tool at the time but they weren't they
32:45 - weren't the long-term solution
32:48 - and then we had the lack of um
32:50 - you know income because of the the
32:52 - closing of jobs and the families who
32:54 - were artists who couldn't go to the
32:55 - shows um really not being able to have
32:57 - any disposable income to buy the the
33:00 - cellular you know the
33:02 - the um prepaid card that may or may not
33:05 - work because the cellular coverage may
33:07 - or may not have been great
33:08 - across your tribal land so with your
33:11 - back up against the wall and all your
33:13 - options just disappearing in front of
33:15 - you you get pretty brave next slide
33:18 - please
33:20 - you come to the realization that you
33:22 - have to do it yourself so you look
33:24 - around the room and you're like okay
33:26 - who's doing it with me
33:28 - and you're like how do how do we figure
33:30 - this
33:31 - and i think that one of the reasons we
33:32 - were able to be that brave is because of
33:34 - some more call share later is that we
33:36 - had just put in those fiber optic
33:38 - networks so we had already got our hands
33:39 - a little bit dirty
33:41 - um
33:42 - and what we knew more than anything is
33:44 - that we had to
33:46 - in short order
33:48 - for remote learning provide provide our
33:51 - students and families this this
33:53 - beautiful magical world of floating blue
33:57 - orbs
33:58 - that connect us
34:00 - far and near
34:02 - to do our work to give us entertainment
34:04 - to give us ideas to connect with the
34:06 - global information age
34:09 - so how exactly do you do that
34:12 - next slide please
34:14 - you when you build it yourself
34:18 - you deal with a lot of dirt this is the
34:20 - internet this is all that's behind like
34:24 - the magic and it's so not magical
34:27 - um they're big projects you do it you
34:29 - know one step at a time but essentially
34:32 - that's conduit that's fiber optic
34:34 - conduit and those are plows
34:36 - so it scratches a hole a line in the
34:39 - ground as least
34:41 - invasive as possibly you pull in the
34:43 - conduit you pull in the cable and you
34:46 - plug it in
34:47 - and this is what we spent from 2018
34:50 - doing not anticipating the pandemic but
34:53 - trying to solve our connectivity issues
34:55 - because i told you where we were
34:56 - starting um the pueblo of cochiti when
34:59 - we started had that 25
35:02 - of one phone so while this seems
35:04 - dramatic to do
35:06 - it was very it was the best choice that
35:09 - we had
35:10 - and once you figure out kind of the um
35:15 - the the project management pieces
35:17 - from the funding to the permitting to
35:20 - the construction which is that fastest
35:22 - part to the lighting up you see that
35:25 - it's doable
35:27 - it did take us about three years to put
35:29 - in these 260 mile networks and it was a
35:31 - group of us it wasn't it was me from the
35:34 - santa fe indian school as the e-rate
35:36 - person we used the fcc e-rate project
35:38 - each one was about four million dollars
35:40 - but we got a 95 federal subsidy and then
35:44 - the consortium members divided that last
35:47 - amount across um
35:49 - across the group so each library paid
35:52 - about sixty thousand dollars which then
35:54 - was reimbursed by the state so
35:56 - essentially for the the libraries
35:58 - themselves and the schools in these part
36:00 - in these projects it was free
36:03 - we met every thursday as a group of
36:05 - librarians education directors myself
36:08 - tribal administrators and then other
36:10 - people that came in and out depending on
36:12 - what project phase we were in and at one
36:15 - at no time did anybody know
36:18 - everything
36:19 - there would be times where we were at a
36:20 - part where none of us had that
36:22 - experience um and we just went and found
36:25 - it or when it was time to do a
36:26 - permitting and somebody's like okay i i
36:29 - know how to do that through you know my
36:30 - job and so we pieced it together from a
36:33 - collective and i think that's the
36:35 - strength that we have and um
36:38 - that we discovered that we didn't know
36:41 - was the strength
36:42 - that we were coming from community
36:44 - providing our own community solution and
36:47 - we were solving it from from within
36:50 - um by the way when we were meeting at
36:52 - all those libraries every thursday for
36:54 - those three years they were sleepy you
36:56 - know we'd have the whole place to
36:57 - ourselves their small one-room libraries
36:59 - anyway but then once we flipped the
37:01 - switch and turned the internet on we
37:03 - would go back to those same libraries
37:05 - and the all the computers would be full
37:07 - there would be people milling around the
37:09 - bookshelves and there was just a
37:11 - vitality and a life at some point we
37:14 - realized we were doing more than just um
37:17 - trying to find cheap fight um cheap fast
37:19 - internet
37:23 - original goal was
37:25 - wasn't community transformation
37:28 - but that is exactly what we accomplished
37:31 - and what was revealed by bringing
37:34 - the connectivity to these to these
37:36 - stripes next slide please
37:40 - so the way that in in broadband and i'm
37:42 - going to back up now because it's this
37:44 - is the the middle mile is the beginning
37:45 - of the story but it really just set us
37:47 - up for the covid our code solutions
37:50 - was to just explain a little bit about
37:52 - broadband infrastructure so the first
37:54 - vocabulary we use is the middle mile and
37:57 - that's the cochiti center amigo san
37:59 - felipe santa ana bernalillo to the
38:01 - albuquerque and that's regional that's
38:04 - state to state county to county tribal
38:06 - ant tribal land and that's where you put
38:08 - in the big trunks
38:10 - and they provide the
38:12 - transport
38:14 - to the small communities
38:16 - and that's the last smile
38:18 - and when you're doing last mile services
38:20 - that's to home or to business um
38:22 - directly
38:23 - so they the last mile in the middle mile
38:25 - work together middle miles oh fiber is
38:28 - king you always want fiber optics
38:30 - and you those are going to be multi-year
38:33 - millions of dollar projects as i just
38:35 - previously described the last mile you
38:38 - can do fiber to the home or you can you
38:40 - can do wireless you have some price
38:42 - points there
38:43 - um
38:45 - and those will go up faster and they're
38:47 - going to be cheaper
38:49 - they're not going to always be as fast
38:50 - and as long term as your fiber to the
38:52 - home networks
38:53 - however
38:55 - that is what we needed to do in kovitz
38:56 - so when with our backup against the wall
38:59 - when we knew we had to bring the
39:00 - internet into homes not just a community
39:02 - and we had no choices
39:05 - what we did is last mile wireless and
39:07 - it's those tribes that had the middle
39:09 - mile already figured out and in place
39:12 - that within months we're able to provide
39:14 - up to 100 residential coverage to get us
39:17 - through remote learning so i'm proud to
39:20 - say that we had at least four of the
39:22 - pueblos um
39:23 - be able to
39:25 - have um internet's residential services
39:27 - that by christmas and one of our largest
39:29 - most traditional pueblos actually had
39:31 - all the homes connected before the first
39:32 - day of school
39:34 - um another thing and why i wanted to
39:37 - pause on this and point out is the tri
39:39 - the fcc tribal priority window that
39:42 - happened last year
39:43 - is that this was the first time ever
39:47 - opportunity by the fcc for the tribes to
39:51 - gain control of the airways above us
39:54 - unlike our other natural resources such
39:56 - as water we don't have any control over
39:59 - the air space above us
40:02 - which transmit these wireless
40:04 - frequencies um
40:06 - and deliver the deliver the internet
40:08 - among other things and this is because
40:11 - we just don't it's just kind of
40:12 - something that the fcc's claimed they've
40:14 - sliced and diced it and sold and leased
40:17 - it above us
40:18 - we could be a um
40:20 - a bitter maybe on some of these auctions
40:22 - in the past but the the entry level to
40:25 - participate in these auctions is not
40:27 - only expensive requires attorneys in an
40:29 - extreme level
40:31 - of um
40:33 - just an effort that's beyond the
40:35 - reasonable expectations of you know of
40:38 - our tribal nations but what chairman pai
40:40 - did and i really appreciate him for this
40:43 - is he there's a spectrum called the 2.5
40:47 - gigahertz band it's the anybody doing 5g
40:50 - the carriers are all over it it's a
40:52 - great mid-range spectrum it goes through
40:54 - trees it goes through walls and
40:56 - everybody's going to want it it's going
40:57 - to go out to auction very shortly before
41:00 - it goes out to auction he gave rural
41:02 - tribes the opportunity to license it
41:05 - before that so what this is in the sense
41:08 - of tribal sovereignty is this is us
41:10 - being able to claim the airspace above
41:13 - us
41:14 - and um not all the tribes are eligible
41:16 - because there had to be some unlicensed
41:18 - 2.5 above you but um
41:21 - over 400 tribes did apply of um you know
41:25 - the 570 580 number of um
41:29 - tribes in the united states
41:31 - and
41:32 - largely were successful so we're gonna
41:34 - see in the future that these tribes now
41:36 - have the expectation to build and
41:38 - utilize these wire uh these wireless
41:41 - networks
41:42 - so this is like a new beginning and a
41:44 - new birth nationwide for our tribes to
41:47 - participate in telecommunications
41:49 - as as carriers as providers as an
41:52 - operator not as a customer so in terms
41:55 - of tribal self-determined determination
41:57 - and capacity building it's a really
41:59 - exciting and powerful time for our
42:01 - tribal communities
42:03 - next slide please
42:06 - so
42:07 - at that after all that after we had the
42:10 - great idea realized there were like some
42:13 - barriers to the great idea
42:15 - made it through coven provided in-home
42:18 - residential access you know we get back
42:20 - to the curriculum we get back to what we
42:22 - started to do at the very beginning and
42:24 - i had i had taken this picture or used
42:27 - our
42:29 - um
42:31 - with one of our tribal communities you
42:32 - know through covid um
42:35 - in
42:35 - in talking about our experience and i
42:38 - just saw it the other day and then it
42:39 - just really pulled it all together
42:41 - because you see a native language
42:42 - teacher talking over
42:46 - meets resume and have my glasses on with
42:49 - another instructor and then a student in
42:52 - home
42:53 - using the tablets
42:56 - and
42:57 - this image just is like the perfect
43:00 - synopsis of all these efforts because
43:03 - for this picture to happen for the in
43:05 - that library
43:07 - to have the internet that's that middle
43:09 - mile work that's the work since 2015.
43:12 - um through the covit experience those
43:16 - laptops that they're using and the fact
43:18 - that the student has internet
43:19 - connectivity her last mile connectivity
43:22 - is what provided her to be able to be on
43:25 - that screen
43:26 - that usda distance learning and
43:28 - telehealth grant bought the equipment
43:29 - the video conferencing equipment for the
43:31 - library
43:33 - and it comes together perfectly to do
43:36 - what we had asked it to do in the in
43:39 - that in that vision
43:41 - and although that seems like a lot of
43:42 - effort for one interaction
43:45 - with one student
43:47 - you know we replicated this um
43:49 - i think it was the 16 actually tribal
43:51 - libraries who got the equipment and you
43:54 - know putting in that middle mile
43:55 - infrastructure um 11 of 19 and with the
43:58 - recent federal funding you know we could
44:00 - be pretty darn close to the all of the
44:02 - 19 pueblos in new mexico having the
44:04 - middle mile
44:05 - i didn't focus it on the other slide but
44:07 - at least 11 of the pueblos and now more
44:09 - again with all the federal funding and
44:11 - planning coming in are delivering
44:13 - wireless or fiber to the home solutions
44:16 - so we have the infrastructure in place
44:19 - increasingly there's always you know
44:21 - work to be done but a lion's share
44:24 - significant progress is made
44:26 - to do
44:28 - to have a systematic statewide tribal
44:30 - solution
44:31 - next slide
44:35 - um and what that is going to do
44:37 - so we we have this connectivity and
44:40 - equally as important as that
44:42 - is we're connected to each other
44:45 - we're connected as tribes and we're
44:47 - connected as educational stakeholders
44:49 - whether we're libraries whether we're
44:51 - public schools bie schools charter
44:54 - schools head starts or higher ed and
44:57 - what we can do with that in education is
44:59 - something that indian education has
45:01 - never
45:02 - participated in before
45:05 - and were that is connecting us to um
45:08 - higher education in new ways
45:12 - that um
45:13 - for instance when i designed these
45:15 - networks these middle mile networks we
45:17 - connected to albuquerque
45:18 - and our network facility is in a room
45:21 - in a carrier hotel
45:24 - with all the other carriers carriers of
45:26 - carriers in what's called the
45:27 - albuquerque gigapop that's a higher ed
45:30 - regional network that connects all of
45:32 - the new mexico
45:34 - universities and colleges together so
45:37 - now we have a tribal library in cochiti
45:39 - pueblo and we're connected not just to
45:41 - unm the university of new mexico we're
45:43 - connected to every university in new
45:45 - mexico think about the potential for
45:48 - distance learning and dual enrollment
45:49 - there
45:51 - the albuquerque giga pop is a research
45:53 - and education network nationally is
45:55 - connected with internet too
45:58 - so now we're have access to advanced
46:01 - compute research opportunities in high
46:03 - performance computing big data things
46:06 - that we've never done from our from our
46:08 - home communities and that now we have to
46:10 - figure out how to leverage i i know it's
46:13 - cool i just don't know what to do with
46:15 - it yet i don't know how to drive it yet
46:17 - and that's what i'm hoping you will tell
46:19 - me quite honestly
46:22 - but but we're here it's it's a new
46:24 - paradigm and we we're putting in
46:28 - the infrastructure
46:29 - that not just this generation the next
46:32 - generation are going to leverage and i i
46:35 - and maybe you guys someone out there
46:37 - knows that i saw some sort of statistics
46:39 - the other day that was saying that 60
46:42 - of the generation that we're in their
46:44 - their jobs their future jobs haven't
46:46 - even been defined yet but it's gonna be
46:49 - technology rich it's gonna be utilizing
46:51 - this infrastructure and now our tribes
46:53 - and our students have the opportunity to
46:56 - participate in those
46:58 - in that space just like the peers that
47:01 - are in town that are connected
47:04 - so it's an equalizer and i'm really
47:06 - excited that
47:08 - we've done as much as we can although
47:10 - there's still much more to be done i
47:12 - invite you all into the space and
47:14 - conversation to join in because while
47:16 - we're working on the infrastructure and
47:18 - making grounds it's just the thing
47:20 - now we need the programmatic pieces we
47:23 - need the people side to use the tool for
47:26 - the better to meet all those community
47:27 - goals
47:28 - so again i thank you for for your time
47:31 - today and for the invitation and i hope
47:33 - this is just this beginning of a long
47:35 - conversation and that we can get to
47:38 - those to those next steps and those
47:39 - awesome
47:40 - people and smiley faces and healthy
47:42 - community
47:45 - vision that i think we all have if we're
47:47 - here today so thank you
47:58 - okay we are going to turn it over for q
48:00 - a if there's anyone that has a question
48:03 - and or comment please we'd like for you
48:05 - to either come off mute and or type into
48:07 - the chat we'd love to hear your feedback
48:09 - or any comments that you may have
48:16 - kimball thank you thank you
48:18 - i while we're while we're waiting on
48:21 - folks here um
48:22 - just had a couple of questions um we
48:26 - only have a couple minutes for questions
48:27 - so if you do want to ask kimble anything
48:29 - make sure to share um
48:34 - but one question um
48:37 - of all the lessons learned in your
48:39 - experience developing this developing
48:41 - broadband and being able to make that
48:42 - connection happen
48:44 - what is like your top lesson learned
48:46 - that you you want to make sure that the
48:48 - folks here kind of know about or or can
48:51 - can can walk away with
48:54 - you can't do it yourself
48:57 - there's just no way no one school no one
49:00 - entity can really can really provide the
49:02 - the full solution
49:04 - and to work together like we all sit
49:06 - like i don't know in the tribal lands or
49:09 - in any of your communities if you're
49:10 - experiencing it next to your neighbor
49:12 - who's suffering or next to your um
49:15 - the health clinic next door and
49:16 - everybody's trying to solve it
49:18 - themselves so they're having the same
49:19 - problem and they're just not talking
49:21 - about it so just creating that
49:23 - communication vehicle because people
49:25 - also have access to different resources
49:27 - and so some of them might be the last
49:29 - last mile some of it might be middle
49:31 - mile somebody might have used their end
49:33 - user pieces but all together it'll start
49:35 - chipping away
49:36 - because there's the infrastructure piece
49:38 - and then there's um for institutions i
49:41 - talked about the programming but
49:42 - affordability is a huge um piece of the
49:46 - puzzle because you can put in the most
49:48 - expensive beautiful thing in the world
49:49 - but if people can't afford it then it's
49:52 - for naught
49:53 - so um
49:55 - just as a side note that you have to um
49:58 - there there are federal programs right
50:00 - now there are a lot of short-term
50:01 - band-aids out there but i think when we
50:04 - set um also in this this space which is
50:07 - participating in the
50:09 - in telecommunications we can set those
50:11 - price points
50:12 - so we know it's affordable to our tribal
50:14 - members and then we can also sell to our
50:17 - neighboring communities where we need to
50:19 - make some return on investment and some
50:20 - network sustainability you know some
50:22 - income
50:23 - but we can first serve our community
50:25 - needs as a as just a human rights right
50:28 - a priority
50:32 - campbell was is there anything that you
50:33 - would have done differently based on
50:35 - those lessons learned like thinking back
50:37 - you know hindsight is already always 20
50:39 - 20. is there anything that you would
50:40 - have done differently um
50:42 - that's a good one
50:45 - uh staffing i think i would have got
50:46 - myself some more help
50:49 - i raised my hand and said you know can
50:52 - you know this is a little bit big of a
50:53 - lift for a core group
50:55 - um but where
50:57 - one place then that gets overlooked well
50:59 - two
51:00 - i think that with being short staffed if
51:02 - we had shared our successes more i think
51:05 - we could have
51:07 - given i think other communities could
51:09 - more quickly and more
51:11 - and the second piece is advocacy oh my
51:14 - gosh
51:15 - um the federal advocacy is just so
51:18 - important it's when the fcc opens an
51:20 - order in a comment period
51:22 - you know send the letter um you know
51:25 - there or send the letter to your
51:26 - congressional delegation
51:28 - because there are advocates out there
51:30 - and if they hear your example you're a
51:32 - real life example because that's what
51:33 - they're starved for right they can write
51:35 - legislation but they need to hear it
51:38 - from the first-hand experience to carry
51:40 - those stories forward with them to make
51:42 - the case for the dollars for you
51:45 - so i think upping the advocacy and
51:47 - upping some of the
51:49 - information sharing
51:51 - would have mobilized kind of the effort
51:53 - in a little bit stronger and faster
51:58 - thank you thank you so much for the
52:00 - journey the story that you shared it was
52:03 - inspiring i think so many of us are
52:05 - saying absolutely wow
52:07 - of all that you've accomplished if you
52:09 - look in the chat you will see that we
52:10 - are just truly amazed and inspired um
52:13 - andrea thank you for joining us and
52:16 - partnering with us to make sure that
52:18 - this conversation is happening and
52:20 - kimball again thank you for your
52:21 - inspiring stories
52:24 - hopefully this is not the last time that
52:26 - we have conversations like this and we'd
52:29 - love to continue to partner with that
52:31 - being said thank you from code.org as
