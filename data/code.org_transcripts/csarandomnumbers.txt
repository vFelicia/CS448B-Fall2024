00:10 - my name is noah
00:11 - and i design the shopping experiences
00:14 - that help customers choose and purchase
00:17 - devices
00:18 - my advice to students
00:20 - is follow your passion
00:22 - and you'll find your unique way to
00:25 - change the world in a good way
00:29 - when we play games it's more interesting
00:31 - if something random happens every time
00:34 - we play
00:35 - an enemy character could pop up in a
00:38 - random part of the screen giving us a
00:40 - fresh challenge every time we play
00:44 - instead of programming every possible
00:46 - move or game outcome which could take a
00:48 - long time
00:50 - we can use the method random which is a
00:53 - static method from the math class
00:56 - let's see how it works
00:59 - first to create a random number we call
01:02 - math.random
01:04 - random is a static method so we can call
01:07 - it in the class which is math
01:11 - this method call returns a random double
01:13 - between 0.0 inclusive
01:17 - and 1.0 exclusive
01:20 - in other words the double generator will
01:23 - be a random decimal number greater or
01:26 - equal to 0.0
01:28 - and less than 1.0
01:32 - to increase the number range from 0 to a
01:35 - number greater than 1
01:37 - we have to multiply the returned value
01:39 - of method called by a scalar
01:43 - for example
01:44 - to generate a number random number
01:46 - between 0 and 7
01:49 - not including 7
01:50 - we would write math.random times 7.
01:55 - each time we make the call the value
01:57 - remains within the range but we get a
02:00 - new random number
02:03 - to change the starting number of the
02:04 - range we need to offset the range by
02:07 - adding an amount to map that random
02:11 - let's see what happens when we add one
02:14 - another way of saying this is that we
02:16 - offset by one
02:18 - when we do this the range of possible
02:21 - random numbers returned is shifted to be
02:24 - 1.0 to 8.0
02:28 - notice that both the starting and end
02:30 - numbers were shifted by one
02:34 - math.random generates random doubles
02:38 - if we wanted whole numbers we would need
02:40 - to cast the values
02:43 - but be careful
02:45 - the minimum value will still be one
02:48 - but since we are getting rid of the
02:50 - decimal places the max number this will
02:53 - evaluate to is seven
02:56 - casting seven point ninety nine to an
02:59 - integer makes it seven
03:02 - using random is a great shortcut for
03:05 - creating elements that can change
03:08 - try it
