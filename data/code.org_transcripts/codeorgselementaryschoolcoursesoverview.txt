00:03 - what computer science is is that it's a
00:06 - way to impact the world it's
00:09 - foundational for any type of work
00:12 - programming is fun and easy you can do
00:15 - anything your mind wants to do
00:17 - programming isn't as hard as it seems
00:18 - it's actually really easy when you
00:20 - follow this learning these skills isn't
00:22 - just important for your future it's
00:24 - important for our country's future I
00:26 - feel pretty passionate about making sure
00:27 - that we're equipping our kids with a
00:30 - real tool set when they leave K through2
00:33 - education we designed the code.org
00:35 - courses to feel like a game you're
00:37 - writing simple code to solve puzzles to
00:39 - get to the next level and the
00:41 - programming uses visual blocks instead
00:43 - of typing which is how introductory
00:45 - programming is taught at leading
00:46 - universities these days because it's
00:48 - easier for the kids to get started and
00:51 - as a teacher you get a dashboard showing
00:53 - your students progress throughout the
00:55 - course code.org has three courses that
00:58 - we recommend for grades K through 5
01:00 - each course is a mix of lessons where
01:02 - students write programs on the computer
01:05 - and lessons where teachers lead
01:07 - activities so students learn computer
01:09 - science Concepts without the use of a
01:11 - computer in course one which is meant
01:13 - for early readers grades K through 1 our
01:16 - online lessons start off with learning
01:18 - how to use the mouse to drag and drop
01:20 - puzzle pieces students then go on to
01:23 - write programs that draw different
01:25 - patterns get the Angry Bird to move to
01:27 - the pig move a be around to collect
01:30 - nectar and make
01:32 - honey and in the spelling B students
01:35 - write programs to move the be around and
01:36 - spell different words if your Elementary
01:39 - School students can read and are new to
01:41 - computer science we suggest starting
01:43 - with course two which is recommended for
01:46 - grades 2 through five some of the same
01:49 - characters from course one show up in
01:51 - course two and there are also some new
01:53 - characters like writing your very own
01:55 - Flappy Bird game once students have
01:57 - finished course 2 they can move on to to
02:00 - course three which we recommend for
02:01 - grades 4 through 5 familiar characters
02:04 - like the artist and Angry Birds show up
02:06 - along with new puzzles like the farmer
02:09 - and creating a bounce
02:11 - game in all three of these courses
02:14 - students also work on open-ended
02:15 - sections where they can create art of
02:18 - their own or a custom story or game this
02:21 - is a great way for students to use
02:23 - computer science Concepts that they
02:25 - learned in the puzzles to express their
02:27 - creativity and create something that is
02:29 - completely their
02:31 - own yes oh my go oh wa if it's something
02:36 - engaging and it's something fun for them
02:38 - and it builds these critical thinking
02:40 - and problem solving skills then we're
02:42 - only setting them up for success and it
02:44 - we should be using
02:45 - it and that's part of our task is to
02:48 - educate students that you know what
02:50 - computer science is not for them over
02:52 - there or somewhere else it's for you
02:53 - here
02:58 - now
