00:05 - my name is kaylee brock and i'm a
00:08 - software engineering intern here at
00:10 - code.org and i'm currently studying
00:12 - computer science at the university of
00:14 - waterloo
00:15 - anything that we build with technology
00:17 - is to solve a problem for people and so
00:21 - if people
00:22 - don't want to use what you build because
00:25 - it doesn't look good or it's not
00:27 - designed to be able to be easily used
00:30 - then why bother because they're just not
00:31 - going to use it so for me design is
00:34 - always an integral part of every project
00:36 - that i work on
00:39 - the user interface of an app is what we
00:41 - call all the components of an app that a
00:43 - human can interact with
00:45 - laying out and designing what the screen
00:47 - looks like deciding what kinds of things
00:49 - a user can do like click a button enter
00:51 - text swipe to a different screen all of
00:54 - these are aspects of user interface
00:56 - design fortunately apple app has a
00:59 - feature called design mode a design tool
01:01 - that lets you quickly and easily design
01:03 - your user interface
01:05 - let's see more about how design mode
01:07 - works
01:09 - in app lab you'll see a switch right
01:11 - above the app that switches the toolbox
01:13 - from code toolbox to the design toolbox
01:17 - we call this switching into design mode
01:20 - in design mode you can drag and drop
01:22 - user interface components onto the
01:24 - screen and position them wherever you
01:25 - like
01:27 - you can also easily resize an element on
01:29 - the screen by clicking and dragging the
01:31 - little handle on the bottom right corner
01:34 - whether you're adding an image element
01:36 - to your app or background images for
01:38 - buttons you can enter the url of the
01:40 - image you want to use
01:42 - if the image is very large you might
01:44 - need to set the width and height numbers
01:46 - so the resize handle fits in the window
01:51 - instead of entering a url of an image
01:53 - you can also click the choose link next
01:55 - to the text box which lets you upload
01:57 - your own image and sound files from your
02:00 - computer to your app
02:02 - when you upload a file it goes into a
02:04 - list of assets you've uploaded so far
02:08 - once it's uploaded you can choose that
02:10 - file
02:11 - lastly you should know the screen itself
02:14 - is an element of your app you can set
02:16 - the background color or background image
02:18 - for the screen
02:19 - the screen also has an id and can
02:21 - respond to events like any other element
02:24 - for example you might want to know when
02:26 - your user clicked on the screen
02:29 - you can also have multiple screens in
02:30 - your app
02:31 - to add a screen you can drag out a
02:34 - screen element or use the pull-down menu
02:36 - just above the design area
02:44 - once you add a screen give it a
02:46 - meaningful id
02:48 - you can use the pull-down menu to switch
02:49 - between screens in design mode
02:52 - but how do you write code to control
02:53 - which screen to show
02:55 - you'll see a command in the ui controls
02:58 - code toolbox called set screen
03:00 - setscreen will change the app to show
03:02 - the screen specified by the
03:04 - id you give it
03:06 - using design mode in app lab is your
03:08 - gateway to quickly and easy making nice
03:10 - looking apps
03:11 - you can add elements to your app upload
03:13 - files like images and sounds even add
03:16 - multiple screens
