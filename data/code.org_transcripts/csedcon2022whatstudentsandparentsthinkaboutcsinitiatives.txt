00:00 - my name again if you forgot from just
00:03 - yesterday his is Pat Young praditt and
00:07 - uh I wanted to tell you a little
00:09 - something about me that you might not
00:11 - know
00:12 - I've really only done two things in my
00:16 - career as an adult
00:19 - sure when I was in high school I
00:21 - lifeguarded for a couple years but that
00:24 - didn't count
00:25 - other than that I've only done two
00:27 - things and the two things are teach for
00:31 - 13 years
00:33 - middle school and high school
00:35 - special ed
00:36 - science and computer science not all at
00:39 - the same time and middle school was
00:41 - definitely the hardest and in middle
00:43 - school I taught eighth grade by the way
00:45 - of Middle School eighth grade I don't
00:47 - think was the hardest grade seventh
00:49 - grade was definitely the hardest I
00:51 - remember walking into a seventh grade
00:52 - room yeah so if you're a seventh grade
00:54 - teacher out there
00:55 - bless your heart
00:58 - bless your heart
01:00 - um
01:01 - but I remember walking into a seventh
01:03 - grade classroom to sub just to cover for
01:05 - a teacher at the last second walked in
01:07 - they were the kids were talking I sat
01:09 - down the desk they were just talking
01:11 - they were oblivious they didn't even
01:12 - know I was in there and I just thought
01:14 - oh what if I just don't say anything how
01:16 - how long could this go until they like
01:18 - look at me and are like so is education
01:21 - going to happen
01:23 - um they went on for 30 minutes
01:25 - and you know what I was fine with that
01:27 - because I was just covering for the
01:28 - teacher I didn't care you know what I
01:29 - mean like I was fine with that uh but
01:32 - that that just amazed me and I was like
01:33 - I'm so glad I don't teach seventh grade
01:36 - so I moved to uh the high school at some
01:40 - point and this is actually the very last
01:43 - class I ever taught seventh period AP
01:45 - Computer Science school year 2012 2013
01:49 - Springboro High School Silver Spring
01:51 - Maryland
01:52 - and uh uh this class uh reflected gosh
01:57 - seven eight years of like like program
02:01 - building for many of you teachers out
02:04 - there for many of you who've been
02:05 - teachers you know what it's like to
02:07 - program build around computer science
02:08 - advocating recruiting students
02:12 - um getting uh administrator buy-in
02:15 - um etc etc you know purchasing equipment
02:17 - and so this class really represented
02:20 - um all I was striving for at this school
02:23 - an upper level class that was large this
02:27 - was one of two AP Computer Science
02:28 - classes and at that time we only had
02:30 - apcsa but not only that but students of
02:34 - all different ages races and genders
02:36 - taking computer science it was a
02:39 - beautiful beautiful thing a class that
02:40 - totally represented the school
02:44 - um an interesting note about this class
02:46 - there were a lot of athletes who
02:48 - actually took computer science that year
02:49 - and almost every single athlete was a
02:52 - girl look at that they're they're
02:54 - wearing their uniforms in front so it
02:55 - was amazing a class that really broke
02:58 - stereotypes
03:00 - there was a one particular student his
03:02 - name was Neiman Neiman and I uh
03:05 - connected in on LinkedIn a while ago
03:08 - um and Neiman told me about the things
03:10 - that he was up to and I was super proud
03:12 - of him I just wanted to tell him that
03:14 - hey Neiman I'm proud of you good job and
03:16 - you know he reflected on his experience
03:19 - at uh Springbrook High School and told
03:21 - me that he just really appreciated the
03:23 - computer science classes that we offered
03:25 - there same thing happens all over the
03:28 - nation in the classrooms that you might
03:31 - teach in that you might monitor that you
03:33 - might coach the classrooms that you all
03:36 - might be setting up through your work as
03:37 - a regional organization as a National
03:39 - Organization Etc but really my why in
03:42 - the end has always been kids like Neiman
03:44 - changing their lives I I can't remember
03:47 - if there was a speaker who said
03:48 - something about like saving lives I
03:51 - don't know was that mache I don't know
03:52 - someone talking about how like we're
03:55 - literally kind of like saving lives when
03:57 - we're teaching computer science and I I
03:59 - feel the same way and this is what why I
04:01 - do what I do by the way if you do
04:05 - um
04:06 - get to reach out to people that you've
04:09 - maybe mentored in the past or students
04:12 - that you've taught tell them that you're
04:15 - proud of them it's a very special thing
04:18 - for them to hear that
04:21 - um
04:22 - yeah so
04:24 - today we are going to end our CS edcon
04:27 - experience with a panel about students
04:31 - and so I want to Let's clap
04:36 - thank you
04:39 - I want to bring up to the stage uh our
04:43 - three students uh starting with Jack
04:45 - senovic uh Jack come on up to the stage
04:49 - Jack is from
04:52 - Omaha Nebraska and Jack is a freshman in
04:55 - college right now at a school that you
04:58 - might have heard of it's called um
04:59 - Harvard
05:01 - something like that
05:03 - um Jasmine fields from digital Pioneers
05:06 - Academy
05:08 - Jasmine is in the 10th grade
05:11 - as well as Quran Owens from digital
05:13 - Pioneers Academy as well
05:15 - whom you saw in the Keynote
05:18 - so it's wonderful to bring back students
05:21 - from digital Pioneers Academy
05:24 - they are nervous folks you know how it
05:26 - is so if we could give them one more
05:27 - round of applause
05:35 - so I have committed to providing you all
05:39 - an experience that you've never had
05:41 - before
05:42 - I'm going to try a lot of different
05:44 - things with this student panel and maybe
05:46 - a lot of different things with a panel
05:48 - in general because we want to end off CS
05:50 - edcom with a bang so we're actually
05:52 - going to start with a game
05:54 - you all ready
05:55 - okay this game is called speed round and
05:59 - I have 10 questions for them they're all
06:01 - going to answer the question they're
06:03 - going to answer the question as fast as
06:05 - possible and we're going to try to get
06:06 - through this in 90 seconds okay if they
06:10 - get through it in 90 seconds they will
06:13 - get a prize
06:14 - if they don't get through it in 90
06:16 - seconds
06:17 - they will get a prize
06:21 - all right you ready I'm ready
06:24 - and let's start the timer
06:26 - favorite recreational activity ping pong
06:29 - basketball soccer
06:31 - who inspires you my mom my mom as well
06:35 - artists musicians
06:38 - invisibility or the ability to read
06:40 - minds read minds read minds invisibility
06:43 - favorite season fall ball fall
06:47 - place you most want to travel to New
06:50 - Zealand Japan Korea
06:52 - is it wrong for a vegetarian to eat
06:54 - animal crackers no no no
06:58 - fill in the blank computer science is
07:01 - awesome great informative
07:03 - last song you heard or downloaded
07:06 - Dynamite
07:07 - frame of mind beautiful days all right
07:10 - uh last Halloween costume vampire uh
07:14 - Ninja Turtle I do not remember
07:17 - you don't want to say that's that's what
07:19 - it is actually all right and this last
07:23 - question we have the time now we got
07:25 - through nine so I'm going to take them a
07:26 - time with this because they don't even
07:27 - know what question I'm going to ask
07:29 - funniest face you can make
07:34 - I I I can't Quran
07:40 - all right all right thanks okay give
07:43 - them a round of applause
07:45 - many seconds to spare good job good job
07:50 - so
07:51 - um uh we're gonna ask some questions and
07:55 - we're gonna start off with Quran and
07:56 - Jasmine uh Quran and Jasmine we learned
08:00 - a lot about your school digital Pioneers
08:02 - uh yesterday
08:04 - uh what is your favorite thing about the
08:07 - school don't worry uh your your
08:09 - principles right there but just pretend
08:11 - that she's not there all right
08:14 - okay uh my favorite thing is to be able
08:18 - to experience computer science like
08:20 - every day because like as you go more
08:24 - and more into like
08:26 - how
08:28 - common it is around you you get to like
08:30 - further appreciate the fact that you
08:33 - could potentially manage any technology
08:37 - that from now in the future that's cool
08:40 - thanks Quran uh I guess I like how it
08:45 - was the main Computer Science Focus
08:47 - school that I saw first
08:49 - and how interactive the teachers are
08:52 - with the students cool all right and uh
08:56 - Jack you know you were recommended for
08:59 - this panel because of your service
09:01 - organization can you tell us more about
09:04 - it yeah so my service organization I
09:06 - co-founded in 2019 called just imagine
09:09 - and since then we've advocated for stem
09:12 - and social emotional learning and in
09:14 - particular we've focused on CS as that's
09:17 - a big part of stem and CS legislative
09:20 - advocacy
09:22 - all right thank you Jack that's really
09:24 - cool uh what was it called again just
09:26 - just imagine just imagine okay just
09:29 - imagine very good uh thank you for that
09:32 - help in Nebraska
09:33 - um If You Don't Know Jack was uh super
09:36 - helpful in getting uh that graduation
09:39 - requirement passed in Nebraska he even
09:42 - um focused on a lot of the what were
09:44 - they senators or Representatives that
09:46 - had maybe were not seeing how important
09:50 - it was or there are certain challenges
09:52 - yeah so our group organized a conference
09:54 - back when this bill was being considered
09:57 - earlier in the year and we talked with
09:58 - state senators especially ones who would
10:00 - vocalized opposition for the bill and
10:02 - really tried to help them understand
10:04 - from a student perspective why CS
10:06 - education is so important for us and why
10:08 - we feel and are so excited now that
10:10 - Nebraska has made CSA graduation
10:12 - requirement oh
10:20 - so uh Jack I know uh you told me that
10:25 - you had a question for Quran and Jasmine
10:27 - actually so you want to ask it yeah I'd
10:30 - love to so cron and Jasmine I'm
10:32 - wondering my school didn't have as many
10:34 - computer science classes as yours in
10:36 - high school and so I'm curious what's
10:38 - that been like taking so many computer
10:40 - science classes and have you enjoyed it
10:43 - well having so many like
10:46 - for such a long time like it gives you
10:48 - more experience of course into like how
10:51 - your livelihood and like understanding
10:54 - computer science would be and
10:56 - it's definitely a good opportunity for
10:58 - jobs and to be employed
11:02 - uh I would say that it's
11:06 - I don't know I guess it's pretty good
11:07 - having like multiple years of Cs because
11:10 - it helped me realize like how much Tech
11:12 - is involved in everything than what I
11:13 - thought it was before awesome awesome
11:17 - um you know I actually do have a
11:20 - surprise another surprise up my sleeve
11:22 - here folks I told you this would be the
11:24 - most non-traditional student panel
11:26 - you've ever seen when was the last time
11:28 - you saw students with their parents
11:31 - right on a panel right so you know what
11:34 - we are going to bring up uh Quran and
11:37 - Jasmine's parents uh so I want to
11:40 - introduce
11:42 - Simone Scott
11:43 - [Applause]
11:45 - karon owens's mom so Simone Scott and as
11:49 - well Latonya Fields Jasmine's mom
11:52 - [Applause]
11:57 - you know what's interesting
11:59 - um both Latonya and Jasmine uh sorry
12:02 - Latonya and Simone were talking about
12:04 - this very thing the fact that uh parents
12:07 - voices uh need to be heard and I know
12:10 - that I was in a session yesterday as
12:12 - well and you're out there somewhere and
12:15 - someone mentioned to me oh yes that's
12:17 - right it was a round table discussion
12:18 - that parents it was uh kalista Chen from
12:21 - reboot representation saying that you
12:23 - know uh we need to hear more from
12:25 - parents so I thought you know what I
12:27 - think uh I think we can arrange that uh
12:29 - so let me ask these parents something
12:33 - um can you tell me a little bit more
12:34 - about where you all are from and your
12:38 - neighborhoods let's start with Simone
12:40 - uh yes so we reside
12:43 - um in Ward seven and eight uh their
12:46 - education is actually in Ward six but we
12:49 - reside in seven and eight and in our
12:51 - district that is the most underserved
12:53 - and um
12:56 - communities
12:57 - um and so our communities are definitely
13:01 - plagued with uh gun violence juvenile
13:04 - suicide and
13:06 - um homicide as well so uh that is
13:10 - definitely a part of our community in
13:13 - everyday life yeah thank you Simone
13:15 - Latonya
13:16 - to piggyback on what she's saying
13:19 - because I am from Ward 8 and the same
13:22 - thing that's plagued and Ward seven is
13:24 - also a part of Ward 8. the challenges is
13:28 - just being able to comfortably get up
13:32 - leave home to go to work and trusting
13:35 - that when my child gets up my child is
13:38 - making it safely to school and back at
13:41 - home
13:42 - and if I can uh piggyback on that I
13:45 - believe that it's important to
13:46 - understand and hear the numbers
13:49 - um the wealth Gap in our communities
13:52 - from a Caucasian family to an
13:57 - African-American family is 68 000 plus
14:01 - um that is excruciating difficult
14:04 - um to come from above that not only that
14:08 - but Ward seven and eight are the least
14:11 - funded within our entire budget of
14:14 - District funds we only receive about
14:17 - four percent of the total budget
14:20 - um and so for us just getting our kids
14:23 - to school is a challenge we do not have
14:26 - accessibility to Quality education east
14:29 - of the river and so we have what is
14:32 - called the lottery and so we have the
14:35 - option to
14:38 - um almost like a weight listing type of
14:40 - thing to get our kids to Quality
14:43 - education and so therefore they actually
14:45 - have to be Bust or transported from our
14:49 - communities into other communities in
14:51 - order to even gain the opportunities
14:53 - thank you for giving us that context
14:55 - that's really important
14:58 - um for those who don't know the DC
14:59 - Washington DC is split into multiple
15:01 - wards Awards one through eight Wards
15:05 - seven and eight are east of the
15:06 - Anacostia I believe yeah so there's
15:08 - Anacostia River Ward seven eight uh
15:10 - otherwise known as southeast DC
15:13 - um
15:14 - uh Simone and Latonya why did you choose
15:19 - a computer science Focus school for your
15:21 - kids
15:25 - the main important thing that I found as
15:27 - a parent was to listen to my child
15:29 - although I had my own ideas and thoughts
15:33 - about what my goals were for him I
15:35 - thought it was important to enrich him
15:37 - with what he actually wanted to do
15:40 - and so seeing how immersed he was with
15:44 - computer science and how much he thrives
15:47 - off of it I felt that it was important
15:49 - to provide that stability and that
15:53 - opportunity to in order for him to truly
15:56 - maximize his uh Limitless potential and
16:00 - at that time we were also facing home
16:03 - security and so I wanted to ensure that
16:07 - we found
16:09 - a stable home for him not just to thrive
16:13 - but to also graduate and for him DPA is
16:18 - our school thank you thank you Tanya
16:22 - I chose DPA because of the principal
16:25 - Miss Ashton absolutely when I first met
16:29 - Miss Ashton when she was promoting the
16:32 - school
16:33 - the biggest
16:35 - phrases or information that she shared
16:38 - with us was that I and my staff are
16:41 - going to know your kids personally by
16:45 - name and you cannot tell me a lot of
16:48 - these schools and these teachers and
16:50 - administrators know their kids by name
16:52 - but miss Ashton does the teachers there
16:55 - know the kids about name they know the
16:57 - kids personalities they know the parents
17:00 - of the kids and that also is what sold
17:03 - me as well for
17:06 - DPA right yeah I'm sorry and if I may I
17:09 - the one thing that also was serving the
17:13 - whole child that was important
17:15 - especially for at that moment for us
17:18 - um I wanted to make sure that Not only
17:20 - was he enriched with the things that he
17:22 - needed
17:23 - um and lacked but I also got an
17:27 - opportunity to have resources provided
17:29 - to me in order to be better in a
17:32 - position to support and help him yeah
17:35 - that's powerful you know that's that's
17:37 - just reality right it's not just about
17:38 - the students about the whole family
17:41 - um and so awesome to have a school like
17:43 - DPA in that Community
17:46 - um
17:47 - I have a question for all three kids
17:50 - this is for all three of you I want you
17:53 - to imagine a kid in your school
17:57 - University freshman and let's imagine
18:00 - for Quran and Jasmine a kid in your
18:02 - neighborhood who doesn't go to DPA but
18:05 - they they could take a computer science
18:07 - class at their school they're lucky
18:08 - enough to have a computer science course
18:10 - in their school
18:11 - um what would you say to these
18:15 - colleagues these kids
18:16 - to get them to try their first computer
18:20 - science experience
18:21 - Jack
18:23 - I think I would say I mean one thing is
18:25 - obviously learning computer science
18:27 - you'll learn coding but I think there's
18:29 - some not so obvious things that you'll
18:31 - learn like the problem solving and
18:32 - creative thinking and really that's so
18:35 - important for students to learn so I
18:37 - would tell them that I'd tell them to
18:39 - you know someone might think you should
18:41 - only take computer science if you're
18:42 - interested in a Tech Career but right
18:45 - now computer science is so important for
18:47 - so many different careers and it's
18:49 - becoming really widespread in the ways
18:51 - that computer science and technology are
18:53 - applied in different careers in our
18:55 - everyday lives so I think understanding
18:57 - just the increasing importance of
18:58 - computer science would also help
19:00 - students give them that extra push to
19:02 - take a computer science class okay now
19:04 - before we go to Quran and Jasmine now
19:06 - that was a good answer Jack I can't
19:08 - imagine you giving that to another what
19:11 - 18 year old or 19 year old you probably
19:13 - say it in a different way right at
19:15 - University I don't know maybe though
19:17 - okay all right all right Quran Jasmine I
19:19 - want you to literally imagine another
19:22 - 10th grader in your neighborhood same
19:25 - age
19:25 - what would you say to them normal human
19:28 - words
19:32 - normal kid words
19:37 - uh I'd say just
19:40 - like there's so many interesting things
19:42 - in computer science that aren't like
19:45 - I feel like people think of computer
19:47 - science as just sitting down
19:49 - staring at a black screen full of text
19:51 - and just typing sometimes it's not just
19:54 - that there are so many departments and
19:57 - different small parts that you could
20:00 - introduce someone to and not just the
20:03 - coding part and maybe people will get
20:05 - interested
20:07 - when they learn the more various
20:11 - field there thanks Cara thank you
20:13 - Jasmine
20:17 - I also excited to just try it out and
20:20 - see if they like it because I don't
20:22 - think I could force somebody to do it
20:24 - I don't know I'll probably show them
20:26 - some YouTube videos that I watched the
20:28 - people like coding stuff into video
20:30 - games that I play so
20:31 - you said show them videos that you've
20:34 - seen and talk about video game setups is
20:36 - that what you said yeah like people
20:38 - coding stuff into video games I play
20:39 - like mods and stuff so you watch videos
20:42 - of people coding video games
20:45 - is this
20:48 - [Applause]
20:50 - how do you know that okay look okay
20:53 - I didn't know this was a so first off
20:55 - just a couple years ago I didn't know it
20:57 - was a thing to watch other people to
20:59 - watch videos of other people playing
21:01 - video games
21:02 - all right yeah now Jasmine is telling me
21:04 - that there's a such thing of such a
21:07 - thing as watching other people code
21:09 - watching videos of other people code
21:12 - video games
21:13 - wow okay all right
21:16 - okay I gotta get with the time maybe one
21:18 - thing I'll add on to is I think computer
21:20 - science is so intimidating and I've even
21:22 - seen people who don't want to take it
21:23 - because they think they're not capable
21:25 - of it so I think one last thing is just
21:27 - tell students you know like you got this
21:30 - it's okay to try something new and
21:33 - you've probably got the support in place
21:34 - and your Educators want you to succeed
21:36 - so yeah okay thank you Jack parents
21:40 - the same thing imagine another parent a
21:43 - parent obviously that doesn't have a kid
21:45 - at DPA and they're in some other high
21:47 - school and there is probably some
21:49 - hopefully some opportunity to learn
21:51 - computer science at the high school what
21:53 - would you say to the parent to get them
21:56 - to get their kid to take their first
21:59 - computer science experience
22:03 - question would be why not
22:06 - you know I feel that a lot of the times
22:09 - we found ourselves within the compounds
22:12 - of things that we feel limit us
22:15 - um or what Jack was saying things that
22:17 - intimidate us or Pro maybe take a
22:20 - glimpse of our insecurities and a lot of
22:23 - what I was saying as far as like the
22:24 - deficit of that academic and wealth Gap
22:27 - that plays a part in parents as well
22:30 - um I know for me really quickly it was
22:32 - difficult at some point for me to do
22:34 - help quran's homework because I was like
22:39 - um and so I found it was important I
22:42 - started to go to the school
22:44 - and start asking the teachers like do
22:46 - y'all do like parent tutoring because I
22:50 - can't I don't know if his homework is
22:51 - right I don't know so but what I will
22:54 - tell a parent is
22:58 - if you want your child to succeed like
23:01 - you say you do
23:03 - then why not give them that opportunity
23:05 - to do just that and I think that they
23:08 - will surprise themselves and surprise
23:10 - you too okay thank you Simone
23:13 - Latonya
23:15 - um
23:17 - it's a breach for me
23:19 - it's a bridge that
23:21 - is from yesterday to the event we are
23:24 - sitting at today for what we take from
23:27 - today and use for tomorrow
23:30 - so I think having computer science
23:33 - in every school no matter what the
23:36 - financial obligations may be the
23:39 - challenges with the verbiage of words
23:40 - when it comes to computer science
23:42 - because that word computer science is
23:46 - intimidating yeah we were talking about
23:49 - that before it's very intimidating and
23:51 - it makes a person think well how much is
23:54 - included in this how much will I be able
23:57 - to obtain how much of it am I going to
24:00 - really use
24:02 - so instead of just keeping their book
24:04 - text you have to take your book text and
24:07 - combine it with the actual product and
24:11 - once the kids start seeing the product
24:13 - of it then there's C hey this isn't as
24:16 - bad as I thought it was now I can see I
24:19 - could code this particular program so I
24:21 - can make this robot do this yeah so
24:25 - being able to take the books put them
24:27 - down or lay them side by side by
24:30 - building of a a robot
24:34 - and then they see the end product bring
24:37 - them together and then they won't be so
24:39 - intimidated yeah yeah give it give her a
24:43 - round of applause
24:47 - I I actually I want to connect this that
24:51 - that uh point to what I heard yesterday
24:54 - on the State Chiefs panel I think one of
24:56 - the State Chiefs said uh all you have to
24:58 - do is bring them to an elementary school
25:01 - classroom and show them like computer
25:03 - science happening like an in an
25:05 - unplugged way uh and that's a great way
25:08 - to get people on board as well that kind
25:10 - of Hands-On learning can I just say one
25:13 - more thing please miss Moshe showed us
25:16 - that when we first met her in school yes
25:18 - because she had an actual robot there
25:21 - for the kids to see that she and some of
25:25 - her other students have actually put
25:26 - together that's actually funny you say
25:28 - that because that I remember that all of
25:30 - the kids are surrounded by the table
25:33 - they had just the robots they had all
25:35 - type of just electronics for the kids
25:38 - and I just saw them like light up it was
25:41 - just like it was amazing and so to
25:43 - piggyback off of that while we have your
25:45 - attention I was just like to say that I
25:49 - would love to see computer science as
25:51 - the platform to provide whole services
25:56 - not just for the child but for the
25:58 - family as you are asking and seeking for
26:02 - funding and as Jack has his uh business
26:06 - as well as the initiative for computer
26:10 - science being a requirement for
26:12 - graduation
26:14 - I feel that a way to
26:16 - gain more engagement is to meet not just
26:21 - the child where they are but to meet the
26:23 - parent where they are and a lot of the
26:25 - times I just what she was saying as far
26:28 - as intimidation it goes for the parents
26:31 - as well just hearing the word computer
26:34 - and then science connected to that it
26:37 - can in a sense make a lot of people in
26:40 - communities like ours question if they
26:43 - are even eligible if it if they're even
26:47 - able to do that and so just hearing the
26:50 - terms makes them feel as though that is
26:53 - something that just doesn't qualify for
26:55 - them and I feel that if you gain more
27:00 - awareness and connection to that I think
27:05 - that you will again to see a lot more
27:07 - parents invested in this particular
27:11 - initiative okay thank you yeah thank you
27:13 - you
27:15 - um I uh I know that
27:20 - Quran
27:22 - actually had a question for the audience
27:25 - yes so get ready
27:28 - Quran needs to plan his future and so he
27:31 - wants your help and so we have four mic
27:34 - Runners out there all you have to do is
27:37 - raise your hand and you can answer
27:39 - quran's question and we can take a
27:41 - couple answers to quran's question brief
27:43 - brief answers Quran what's your question
27:46 - for the audience
27:48 - uh as I prepare for my future by
27:52 - enhancing my UCS skills what is a key
27:56 - piece of advice I could get to make sure
27:59 - I'm more successful later on
28:04 - and I can't see so uh Mike Runners
28:08 - you'll just give it to someone they can
28:10 - just keep start talking all right I got
28:12 - it um hey Quran uh first of all very
28:15 - impressed by all you all and proud of
28:17 - you
28:18 - um
28:19 - computer science can go a lot of
28:20 - different ways in a lot of different
28:22 - places over here other side other side
28:25 - all right
28:26 - [Laughter]
28:31 - there he is
28:32 - computer science go a lot of different
28:34 - places
28:35 - um there's a word in in Japanese I think
28:38 - it's ikigai it says find something that
28:41 - um uh will pay you well
28:43 - is connected to things you're passionate
28:45 - about is of service to your community
28:48 - um what's the fourth name but another
28:49 - fourth one
28:51 - I forget
28:52 - but find a place where computer science
28:55 - meets those those multitude of goals not
28:58 - just you know I'm going to go
28:59 - programming to make some money find
29:00 - things are also services to your
29:02 - community and something that you're
29:03 - connected to and passionate about
29:05 - awesome thank you
29:07 - [Applause]
29:08 - our other advice Keep It Coming okay I
29:12 - got one over here
29:14 - hi
29:15 - so
29:17 - uh having taught computer science for a
29:19 - very long time my advice to you is
29:21 - remember that the ideas at the heart of
29:25 - computer science are there because they
29:27 - work to help you overcome difficult
29:29 - things so don't forget persistence not
29:33 - just computer science all things in life
29:35 - learning from failure all things in life
29:38 - trying something even if you don't know
29:41 - yet if it's right all things in life so
29:44 - the skills that you're learning that are
29:46 - helping you create these programs and
29:48 - these things that no one else has done
29:50 - because they came from your brain they
29:53 - will also help you create programs and
29:55 - things and companies and wealth and all
29:58 - sorts of things that you might not have
30:01 - known to try but you can if you have
30:04 - those skills
30:06 - thank you
30:07 - [Applause]
30:10 - I'm out over here uh I think this is
30:14 - applicable across the spectrum of life
30:17 - in general I've always been a no is not
30:20 - the right answer person
30:22 - somebody presents you with an
30:23 - opportunity say yes because those
30:26 - opportunities then can lead to other
30:28 - opportunities so don't sell yourself
30:30 - short even if you're unsure of something
30:33 - keep persisting love that word uh and
30:37 - moving forward and and don't say no uh
30:41 - to these opportunities that could just
30:46 - enrich your own life not just
30:48 - career-wise but just life-wise
30:51 - thank you thank you Sean we're gonna
30:54 - actually I Know Jack you had uh some
30:58 - advice for Quran as well that you wanted
31:00 - to give right yes of course yes
31:03 - so I think earlier we talked about just
31:06 - how college is different from high
31:08 - school and computer science and one
31:09 - thing I'll say right off the bat is I
31:11 - think that you're going to be so
31:13 - prepared for computer science and
31:14 - college both of you just having so much
31:16 - computer science coursework that's
31:17 - amazing and I think you know college can
31:21 - be really intimidating it can be scary
31:22 - but I think as long as you know you're
31:26 - you put in that effort you utilize the
31:28 - resources around you you're going to do
31:30 - so well so you got this
31:33 - I think
31:34 - what's up what's on your way wait I saw
31:37 - I saw you put the mic to your mouth I
31:39 - was saying thank you oh okay thank you
31:42 - yeah and actually let me just say right
31:44 - quick
31:45 - and then I'm gonna get off here because
31:47 - mothers can't help but give advice right
31:49 - LaTonya I'm not giving advice um just
31:52 - saying thank you for this opportunity
31:55 - absolutely to be a part of this
31:58 - experience for CS
32:01 - [Music]
32:04 - actually I was gonna I was gonna ask you
32:06 - two parents the same thing but I'll ask
32:08 - it to all the students so far because
32:09 - they've actually
32:10 - you know they've attended some sessions
32:12 - they've saunted around this is a very
32:15 - new experience for kids the fact that
32:16 - adults like get together to like plot
32:19 - and scheme about about how to get more
32:22 - kids like you to take computer science
32:24 - it's probably like what I didn't I
32:26 - didn't know this was a thing so my
32:28 - question for all you all is like what do
32:30 - you think about the CSI con experience
32:32 - so far what do you think about csed con
32:33 - these folks getting together the
32:35 - sessions that you've attended Jack you
32:37 - want to start sure I mean I definitely
32:39 - will take the photo weather over the
32:41 - Boston weather but you know besides that
32:43 - besides that I've really loved it I've
32:46 - been able to meet so many incredible
32:48 - people and hear about so many different
32:49 - ideas within computer science and
32:51 - education that I really hadn't heard
32:53 - before and that's been so exciting to me
32:56 - so thank you so much for the invite it's
32:57 - really been an honor
32:58 - cool
33:00 - uh I think it's been really cool
33:03 - to just come and uh hear what you guys
33:06 - have to say about it and make decisions
33:08 - about it so yeah I just think it's neat
33:10 - thanks Johnson
33:13 - it's a good experience to like
33:17 - get to have some sort of like dive into
33:20 - the future and what I'll be doing so
33:23 - getting used to it will
33:25 - is a good part of it thanks Quran
33:28 - parents
33:30 - this is an amazing experience
33:33 - um because as an Engaged parent just
33:35 - being able to see
33:37 - um what he's been doing what you guys
33:39 - are doing uh in DPA with our Scholars
33:43 - they had an opportunity to connect with
33:45 - you guys over the summer and for me uh
33:49 - having you guys were able to get
33:50 - legislative here that's impressive so
33:53 - that's amazing but just having a room
33:56 - full of individuals who are for the same
33:58 - goal is amazing and also to hear more
34:03 - about what you guys have planned for our
34:05 - kids but essentially for me as quran's
34:09 - question is just how do I support him
34:13 - more effectively and proficiently and
34:16 - with that I was able to gain a lot more
34:19 - with that but most importantly is what
34:22 - does his future look like and what can
34:24 - that look like for us despite where we
34:27 - come from or what our daily challenges
34:29 - are
34:31 - um and what does employment or business
34:33 - ownership uh look like for our kids
34:38 - um and I know we're in DC we have
34:40 - something like the Marionberry uh summer
34:42 - youth program and so I would love to see
34:44 - more of you guys
34:46 - um holding spaces like that and all of
34:49 - our communities for all of our Scholars
34:51 - so thank you yeah thank you
34:53 - [Applause]
34:57 - very well said I don't think I can top
35:00 - that you're so crazy I don't think I've
35:02 - been tough that you really don't okay so
35:04 - I'm gonna try to top that
35:06 - but what I can say is
35:09 - I really appreciated being able to sit
35:13 - in the audience to be a part of this
35:17 - event but to get to hear
35:20 - other cities challenges and how they've
35:23 - overcome them and so that way we can
35:26 - also take that back to DC to help with
35:29 - our families and the scholars and soon
35:33 - to be programmers and designers and
35:38 - what manufactures and next Google
35:42 - personnels and everything like that but
35:45 - just remember you can also do some
35:48 - internships and come to DC yes
35:51 - students from DC you know to help
35:55 - broaden their range and spectrum of the
35:57 - Cs world thank you thank you
36:03 - okay so we're gonna we're gonna continue
36:06 - rolling with this theme of uh focusing
36:09 - on you all
36:10 - uh you know specifically in the audience
36:14 - we have curriculum and professional
36:17 - learning providers
36:18 - in fact let's let's do an experiment
36:21 - here raise your hand if you are involved
36:25 - in the creation of curriculum
36:29 - okay
36:30 - and raise your hand it could be the same
36:33 - person if you're involved in providing
36:36 - professional learning in some way
36:39 - okay a whole lot of people okay so
36:41 - you're gonna you're basically speaking
36:42 - to the entire audience here uh
36:45 - the question for you all uh panelists
36:48 - what would you want to tell the people
36:50 - who write the lessons your teachers use
36:54 - to teach you with and train your
36:58 - teachers what do you what would you want
36:59 - to tell them what what advice you want
37:01 - to give them
37:03 - what recommendations what do you want
37:04 - from them
37:05 - anyone can start okay perfect I guess
37:07 - first of all I just want to say thank
37:09 - you what you're doing is so important
37:10 - and really for students like us we're so
37:13 - appreciative of what you're doing so
37:14 - thank you so much I think I would say
37:16 - two things so first of all as far as the
37:19 - teacher training I think one of the most
37:21 - important things in any computer science
37:22 - classroom because it can be so
37:24 - intimidating for students is just a
37:26 - supportive environment so considering
37:28 - the big picture the social emotional
37:30 - learning aspect of computer science I
37:33 - think is really crucial I think the
37:34 - second thing would be especially
37:36 - somewhere like Nebraska where there
37:38 - isn't as big of a technology focus and
37:41 - especially in rural areas it can be
37:43 - harder for students to see computer
37:45 - science in their lives ever it might
37:48 - feel sort of distant and so I think
37:51 - showing students the applications of
37:53 - computer science not just in Tech but
37:55 - really in everyday life and how many
37:57 - careers in areas use computer science is
37:59 - something that might be really helpful
38:01 - to help students in their curriculum
38:03 - make computer science feel more personal
38:05 - to them in less system
38:06 - thank you Jack Jasmine uh uh I don't
38:10 - know just make it more fun
38:13 - [Applause]
38:20 - um I'd say it's very important to keep
38:24 - the work that we're doing
38:26 - more like
38:28 - yeah just make it fun so that no one has
38:31 - to feel like they're doing a job or like
38:35 - they're being forced to do something
38:38 - and for the teachers just
38:40 - make sure you're liking what you're
38:43 - doing we don't no one none of us want to
38:46 - do anything we don't want to so just
38:49 - yeah help the teachers like what they're
38:51 - doing
38:52 - yeah we all want teachers like that
38:54 - that's true Quran uh let's uh let's give
38:58 - them all round of applause
39:03 - and and
39:05 - let's end with the parents answering the
39:08 - same question what would you like to
39:09 - tell the curriculum providers and the
39:11 - professional learning providers
39:14 - curriculum based make it less technical
39:18 - with words make it so that it's
39:20 - transparent between the student and
39:23 - yourself they will learn the technical
39:26 - as they Advance on but first started off
39:29 - with transparency and break it down to
39:31 - the level which they're understanded
39:33 - thank you Latonya thank you uh really
39:36 - quickly I would just say again thank you
39:39 - um this is very important for our family
39:42 - for everyone who's sitting up here and I
39:45 - think that incoherently we're speaking
39:47 - for parents who are not even here and I
39:50 - feel what I will leave you with is again
39:54 - addressing the whole child
39:57 - understanding that the policies and
39:59 - legislative
40:00 - processes that you're putting on the
40:02 - table you have to it goes a little bit
40:06 - beyond computer science Jack was talking
40:08 - about something as far as a social
40:10 - emotional learning that's important our
40:13 - kids need that when it comes to mental
40:15 - health our kids need that when it comes
40:17 - to having more resources and I know
40:21 - mache was speaking about that allowing
40:24 - these professionals some who may be
40:26 - retired having them come back and help
40:29 - the teachers so that it's not so much
40:31 - for the teachers responsibilities to do
40:33 - to everything but give them some leeway
40:37 - and some room to to breathe okay
40:41 - um and to to ignite that passion because
40:45 - I feel like when teachers are
40:47 - overwhelmed their stressed they are
40:50 - using their own resources to fund things
40:53 - as well as getting to know each child
40:56 - and everything that's going on with the
40:57 - families I just think it's important
40:59 - that you see all of the full spectrum of
41:04 - what you guys are doing not just
41:06 - computer science because the other
41:08 - um things are important as well in order
41:11 - for us to just close some of the gaps
41:14 - that are happening with our Scholars and
41:16 - with our communities thank you thank you
41:19 - thank you Simone
41:20 - um let's give them another round of
41:21 - applause
41:23 - if I could have a gift
41:25 - uh so I you know they did they passed
41:28 - the test of the speed round so students
41:30 - I do have uh some gifts for you uh we
41:34 - also have some special gifts in there
41:36 - from our friends at ROBLOX
41:40 - wow yeah
41:43 - um so we wanted to give that to you and
41:45 - I just I knew you were going to look at
41:47 - it yeah I just want to say thank you
41:49 - again thank you again thanks all thank
41:53 - you thank you thank you
