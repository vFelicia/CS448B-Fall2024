00:03 - in unit one students learned about the
00:06 - physical internet how Digital Data is
00:09 - transmitted via wires cables and Wi-Fi
00:13 - but the physical internet is inherently
00:16 - unreliable wires can get cut data can
00:18 - get corrupted during transmission and
00:21 - routers can simply drop data when they
00:23 - are overwhelmed with requests
00:25 - additionally data gets broken down into
00:27 - smaller chunks called packets before the
00:30 - data gets sent those packets may arrive
00:32 - at their final destination out of order
00:34 - since they might have traveled different
00:36 - paths along the internet to get there in
00:39 - this lesson students will invent a
00:41 - protocol that the sender and receiver
00:42 - can use to guarantee that all of the
00:45 - information successfully arrived packets
00:48 - will need to be numbered to ensure that
00:49 - they are read in order and Confirmation
00:51 - messages will need to be sent to confirm
00:53 - that each packet was received messages
00:56 - that are not confirmed within a specific
00:58 - amount of time will be reset until
01:00 - receipt of the full message has been
01:02 - confirmed in this way a reliable system
01:06 - for sending messages can be built
01:08 - despite the fact that some packets May
01:10 - occasionally be lost along the way the
01:13 - protocol described earlier is modeled
01:15 - after an actual protocol used on the
01:17 - internet called TCP or the transmission
01:20 - control protocol TCP works on top of Ip
01:24 - and the physical internet to ensure that
01:26 - messages sent on the internet are
01:28 - received in full and are properly
01:30 - reconstructed as a result we often think
01:33 - of the internet as a reliable means of
01:35 - sending information even if on a lower
01:37 - level this is not the case this is yet
01:40 - another example of abstraction on the
01:42 - Internet thanks to TCP we no longer need
01:45 - to concern ourselves with the specific
01:47 - failings of lower layers of the internet
01:49 - that TCP was designed to
01:52 - overcome this lesson primarily addresses
01:54 - Concepts that fall under the CSP Big
01:57 - Ideas of the internet and abstraction in
02:00 - the getting started activity students
02:02 - split into groups to discuss some
02:04 - possible reasons why a message may not
02:06 - arrive at its destination properly aim
02:08 - to keep students focused on what they
02:10 - know about the physical internet and the
02:12 - devices involved like routers as they
02:15 - may initially interpret the prompts at a
02:17 - higher level such as Twitter didn't save
02:20 - the Tweet properly or my friend forgot
02:23 - to hit send the transitional comment
02:26 - after the getting started activity is a
02:29 - particularly critical one as you will be
02:32 - introducing the New Concept of packets
02:35 - where data is divided into smaller
02:37 - pieces before transmission as one
02:40 - mechanism to make the internet a faster
02:42 - and more reliable system to
02:44 - use packets help make the internet
02:47 - faster and more reliable for a number of
02:49 - reasons if a small packet is corrupted
02:51 - in transmission then only a small amount
02:53 - of data will need to be resent breaking
02:56 - up data also prevents the lines of
02:58 - transmission from getting clogged with a
03:00 - single large message and allows
03:01 - different pors of a message to take
03:03 - whichever path is currently fastest on
03:07 - code Studio the internet simulator now
03:09 - breaks a message up into smaller packets
03:11 - which only contain six asy
03:16 - characters add at least four routers to
03:19 - your network for this activity to ensure
03:22 - that packets travel through different
03:24 - routes to reach their destinations and
03:26 - potentially arrive out of order to
03:29 - simulate the unreliability of the
03:31 - internet the internet simulator will
03:33 - automatically drop packets that exceed
03:35 - the preset packet size it will also
03:38 - randomly drop a small percentage of
03:41 - properly sized packets to simulate the
03:43 - inherent unreliability of the
03:50 - internet in groups students will use
03:54 - this version of the internet simulator
03:56 - and devise a protocol to send a 20
03:58 - character message and be certain that
04:00 - their partner received all of it the two
04:03 - primary characteristics to look for in
04:05 - the student Protocols are first a packet
04:09 - numbering scheme and communication of
04:11 - how many packets the receiver should
04:13 - expect and second an acknowledgement
04:16 - message from the receiver back to the
04:18 - sender for each packet so the sender
04:20 - knows whether the packet needs to be
04:22 - resent
04:24 - again have students test their protocols
04:26 - with packets that can't be ordered by
04:28 - human intuition to ensure that they
04:31 - understand the need for packet
04:33 - numbering
