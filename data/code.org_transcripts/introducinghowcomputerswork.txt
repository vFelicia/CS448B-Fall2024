00:00 - Everywhere you look,
computers are changing the world.
00:03 - Whether they're on our desktops,
in our homes, our pockets,
00:07 - or just about anywhere else.
00:10 - But while most of us use
this revolutionary technology daily,
00:14 - we don't often ask:
"How do computers work?"
00:18 - In this series, you're going to learn
how computers really work,
00:21 - starting with what makes a computer
a computer.
00:25 - Then, you'll look at how information
is represented inside the computer
00:29 - using tiny electrical signals going
on and off at mind-boggling speeds.
00:35 - After that, you'll learn how computers
use circuits to do everything
00:39 - from simple math
to simulating entire virtual worlds.
00:44 - Next, you'll zoom out and look
`at the different parts of a computer
00:48 - that actually input, output,
and store all that information.
00:53 - Finally, you'll take a look
at what code actually is
00:56 - and how software controls hardware.
01:00 - So whether you're just curious
about the devices you use every day
01:03 - or you want to design
the innovations of the future,
01:07 - the first step is learning
how computers work.
