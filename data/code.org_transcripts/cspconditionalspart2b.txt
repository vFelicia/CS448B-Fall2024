00:04 - sometimes the decisions you will want
00:06 - your program to make have more than two
00:08 - possible outcomes
00:10 - let's continue our movie rating example
00:13 - where we want to check whether the
00:15 - highest reading you can go see alone is
00:17 - an r-rated movie a pg-13 movie or just a
00:21 - g-rated movie to check between these
00:24 - three different cases we can add an else
00:26 - if statements an else--if statement is
00:30 - another condition that a program checks
00:32 - only if the previous if statements were
00:35 - false
00:35 - so if age is greater than or equal to 17
00:40 - right that user can see an r-rated movie
00:43 - alone else if the age is greater than or
00:47 - equal to 13 right that the user can see
00:50 - a pg-13 movie alone else right that the
00:55 - user can see a g-rated movie alone the
00:59 - elf condition becomes the default
01:00 - condition because when all the previous
01:03 - if an else if statements are false it
01:05 - will default to the else statement be
01:08 - careful as you can struck longer
01:10 - sequences of else if statements if you
01:12 - mix up the order you might not get the
01:15 - behavior you intended in our example
01:18 - imagine we had switched the code so that
01:20 - the first condition checked if the user
01:22 - was old enough to see pg-13 movies like
01:25 - this this would mean that everyone who
01:29 - is 13 or older would be told they can
01:32 - only see pg-13 movies even the adults
01:35 - and with the next elsif line the
01:38 - computer would be looking for people 17
01:40 - or older in the remaining group this
01:43 - code misses the adults because they were
01:45 - true in that first condition this won't
01:48 - work the computer checks the conditions
01:51 - from top to bottom so it is important to
01:54 - enter the most specific condition first
