00:06 - How many numbers are there?
00:09 - How about strings or images?
00:12 - All of the types of data you've seen so far
have infinite variations which allows for
00:17 - a lot of variety in your programs.
00:19 - But sometimes, you just need a simple yes
or no, true or false.
00:24 - There's actually a type just for that.
00:26 - A Boolean is a type of data that can only
have one of two possible values: true or false.
00:35 - That makes them really well-suited to answer
simple true or false questions for our program,
00:41 - such as 3 is less than 4 which we could speak
as is 3 less than 4?
00:50 - The value that returns is true since 3 is
less than 4.
00:54 - Booleans are useful for comparing things.
00:57 - We can ask if one number is less than another,
if two strings are equal and so on.
01:03 - Mathematical functions like less than, greater
than or equal all take two numbers as their
01:09 - domain and produce a Boolean as their range
by comparing the two numbers.
01:14 - Sometimes we want to compare values in more
complex ways.
01:19 - For example, asking if a player's X coordinate
is greater than 0 AND less than 100.
01:26 - Or if string equals up OR down.
01:31 - And even if a number is NOT 42.
01:34 - These blocks (AND, OR, and NOT) allow us to
modify and combine Booleans to answer more
01:42 - interesting and logical questions.
01:45 - In this stage, you'll need to write Boolean
functions to make sure sprites in a game follow
01:51 - the rules that you set out for them, such
as not going off the side of a screen.
