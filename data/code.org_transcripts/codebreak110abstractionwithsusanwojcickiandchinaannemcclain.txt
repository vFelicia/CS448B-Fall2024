02:43 - (countdown chiming)
02:59 - (logo chiming)
03:05 - - Hi, and welcome to Code Break.
03:08 - My name is Hadi.
03:09 - There are thousands of
people who are joining us
03:11 - across Zoom, Facebook
Live, and YouTube Live,
03:13 - and together we're hoping
to build the world's largest
03:15 - live interactive classroom.
03:17 - With so many students at home,
03:19 - my team at Code.org invites
families everywhere to join us
03:22 - for a weekly dose of
inspiration, community,
03:24 - and computer science.
03:25 - I'd like to start by introducing
03:27 - our first special guest this week,
03:29 - YouTube CEO, Susan Wojcicki.
03:31 - Susan, are you there with us?
03:34 - - Hi, can you hear me?
03:36 - - Yup, I can hear you okay.
03:38 - The video is a little bit--
03:39 - - [Susan] Can you see me?
03:40 - - Yup, we can see you just fine.
03:43 - And I'm here with my--
03:44 - - Sort of, not fine.
03:46 - Hello?
03:47 - - Hello, this is my daughter Sofia,
03:49 - and she's my sidekick on Code Break
03:52 - and she's also a budding
computer scientist.
03:54 - - (laughs) Great, we need
more computer scientists.
03:58 - - We definitely do, especially
young women like Sofia.
04:02 - I wanted to start this week's episode
04:04 - by addressing the events of the last week
04:06 - in the United States.
04:07 - This has been something
that's on all of our minds.
04:10 - At a time of a global pandemic,
04:12 - it really has pained me and all of us
04:14 - to see racism grip the United States
04:17 - and cause so much suffering,
04:18 - especially among black communities.
04:21 - Code.org stands together
with the black community,
04:23 - our employees, partners,
teachers, and the students,
04:26 - in the fight against
systemic inequity, racism,
04:28 - and injustice in the United States.
04:31 - We thank all the teachers
04:32 - who strive for equity in our classrooms,
04:34 - who show empathy to a
nation that needs healing,
04:37 - and who work daily to
support the next generation
04:39 - to build a better future.
04:41 - We all also know equity is broader
04:43 - than what happens in the classroom,
04:44 - and opportunity can't be found
04:47 - when racism remains
unaddressed in our world.
04:50 - Susan, I also know YouTube
put out a similar statement
04:53 - just a few days ago, and I
don't know if there's anything
04:56 - you want to add to that--
04:58 - - Yeah.
04:59 - - [Hadi] Go ahead.
05:00 - - Definitely, we were devastated
05:03 - to see those horrible
acts of racial injustice,
05:08 - and we wanna to make sure
05:10 - that everyone in our
society can feel safe.
05:14 - And it was devastating for us to see,
05:16 - and so we made a lot of
statements on the YouTube platform
05:19 - to make sure that we use
our platform to stand up,
05:24 - stand up against racial injustice
05:26 - and speak up for what we think is right,
05:29 - which is bringing everyone together
05:31 - and enabling everyone to be safe.
05:33 - And we're making a donation to a group
05:38 - that does a lot of work in this area,
05:40 - and also using our platform to make sure
05:43 - that we can bring
different voices together
05:46 - to process all the information
05:48 - and make sure that we can make sure
05:49 - that all the black voices
that have so much to say
05:53 - and these others who really wanna chime in
05:57 - and talk about the challenges
of injustice in our society,
06:02 - are able to voice their points of view
06:05 - and bring us all together
for a better world
06:08 - so that everybody can feel safe.
06:11 - And we're continuing to do what we can.
06:17 - And it's a very tough situation,
so I'm glad that, Hadi,
06:21 - that you brought this up
at the very beginning,
06:24 - and that we can address it for everybody.
06:29 - - So we would usually start our episodes
06:30 - with a computer science joke of the day
06:32 - but instead of doing that,
what we wanna do instead
06:35 - is just stand in solidarity
with all the victims
06:38 - of racism in the United States.
06:39 - I want to ask everybody,
including those at home
06:42 - who are on mute or not on the camera
06:45 - to join me in a moment of silence,
06:47 - to reflect on how we can all individually
06:49 - help make our world a better place.
06:51 - And, Susan, if you don't
see everybody's faces,
06:54 - if you click the little
button that looks like this
06:55 - in the right hand side of
your screen, that would help.
06:59 - And if we could go to gallery
view so everybody else at home
07:02 - sees all the faces on the
screen, that would be great.
07:05 - And we'll start with a
brief moment of silence.
07:31 - All right, having spent that time,
07:35 - I wanna have us all first
meet our live audience.
07:38 - We have a few dozen students on camera.
07:40 - Could we all unmute--
07:44 - - Hello?
07:46 - - [Students] Hi.
07:48 - - Hello.
07:49 - - [Students] Hi.
07:51 - - Hello.
07:51 - - [Students] Hi.
07:54 - - We're back to mute,
07:55 - and Susan, that's the folks
that you can see on camera,
07:59 - but most of the people on this call
08:01 - actually aren't on camera.
08:03 - To show you where our
audience is calling from,
08:05 - as everybody was joining in,
08:07 - here's a map of where
people are calling from.
08:09 - There's a few people
who fake their locations
08:11 - coming from Antarctica,
but as you can tell,
08:14 - people are calling in, not
only from all over the country,
08:16 - but all over the world, all
sorts of different time zones,
08:20 - from Africa, from east Asia, from Hawaii.
08:24 - For some of the folks, it's
at 7:00 a.m their time,
08:26 - for some folks it's 1:00 a.m their time,
08:29 - which is pretty incredible.
08:31 - As we go through these episodes,
08:33 - if folks have questions for Susan,
08:35 - you can submit them online.
08:37 - You can go to Code.org/questions,
08:39 - and we'll have a chance to
ask your questions to Susan.
08:43 - I know every single
person who's on this call
08:45 - is a user of YouTube,
08:46 - and you might have interesting questions.
08:49 - Today, we're gonna be
learning about abstraction,
08:52 - which is one of the
most important concepts
08:54 - of Computer Science, and
we're gonna have three parts.
08:56 - Unplugged, we're gonna
learn about the functions,
08:59 - and then we're gonna
learn about libraries.
09:01 - But first, and I want to start
09:02 - with a few questions for Susan,
09:05 - I'm gonna ask some questions
and then some of our students
09:07 - have questions as well.
09:09 - Susan, you were there at the
very, very beginning of Google.
09:12 - In fact, it started in your own garage.
09:14 - Can you share a little
bit about the experience
09:16 - of having a company as important
and significant as Google,
09:19 - start in your garage?
09:21 - - Sure, well, it started because I knew
09:25 - the two founders of Google,
Sergey Brin and Larry Page,
09:29 - when we were all just friends,
09:30 - no one had started any companies.
09:32 - And I had just bought a house
and houses are expensive,
09:36 - and I wanted to have someone
help us pay the rent.
09:39 - And so they had just started Google
09:43 - and they were having a hard
time finding office space.
09:46 - And so we just agreed, "Why
don't you just move in?
09:49 - "You can rent our garage."
09:52 - And, actually, they
entered through the garage,
09:53 - but they had a few rooms in the house too.
09:57 - And they got up to about seven employees,
10:00 - and it was pretty funny having
a company in your house.
10:05 - And at the time, it actually
was pretty convenient
10:08 - because we got really
good internet service
10:10 - and that was a big benefit for us.
10:13 - But we had a few issues late at night
10:15 - because they would stay
there all night working
10:17 - and, of course, we wanted to go to bed
10:19 - and sometimes they were
making a lot of noise.
10:21 - But overall, it was pretty fun
10:26 - to have them there in our house.
10:27 - And when they got up
to about seven people,
10:30 - we both agreed that it
was a little too crowded.
10:32 - It was not a big house,
it's a pretty small house,
10:37 - and we shared it with them.
10:40 - But I think what it shows
10:42 - is that big ideas can
come from young people,
10:46 - and Sergey and Larry at the
time were still in school.
10:50 - They were in their early 20s,
10:52 - and young people have a
lot of really good ideas,
10:56 - and they saw this opportunity.
10:58 - And I think the reason it's relevant here
11:00 - is because we have a lot of young people
11:02 - and you probably are seeing opportunities
11:04 - that no one else has seen
11:05 - because our world is changing so much.
11:07 - And that's an opportunity for
you to be able to seize that,
11:10 - and learning how to
build these technologies
11:14 - will enable you to open
up a lot of opportunities,
11:18 - just like it did for Sergey and Larry.
11:21 - So it's funny now because
Google is such a big company,
11:27 - and at the time it seemed really normal
11:30 - to have them there working in our house.
11:33 - - Sofia is hoping to start
a company to sell soap.
11:36 - Maybe she'll be doing that
in our garage as well.
11:39 - - Probably not.
(Susan laughs)
11:41 - - So we have some students question,
11:43 - and there's a bunch of these,
11:45 - so let's try to get through them quickly.
11:47 - So we have Kalkidan from Maryland.
11:50 - If we could unmute her,
11:51 - and Kalkidan can you ask your question?
11:53 - - What was the first YouTube
video that you watched?
11:59 - - That's a good question.
12:01 - - So, I think I could
answer that in two ways.
12:05 - So we, at Google, started a video service
12:11 - similar to YouTube,
12:12 - and at the time we had
something called Google Video
12:14 - where we just enabled
people to upload videos.
12:17 - And the very, very first
video I ever watched
12:21 - of just uploaded from
people from the internet,
12:24 - was this video of these
puppets that were purple
12:29 - and they were singing in
a language I had no idea.
12:32 - I think it was Swedish or Danish.
12:34 - And I thought it was the
weirdest thing I had ever seen.
12:37 - And I wasn't sure what to think,
12:38 - and I actually had my kids
with me and they looked at it.
12:42 - We were all really silent after it ended,
12:43 - and then they all started laughing
12:46 - and they wanted to see it again.
12:48 - And it was a lot of fun.
12:50 - And then there was another video
once we built Google Video,
12:53 - that was really our first hit,
12:54 - which were these two
students that were singing
12:56 - to the Backstreet Boys in their dorm room.
12:58 - And they actually had their
roommate in the background
13:01 - doing his homework the whole time.
13:03 - And it became a huge hit,
13:04 - it got millions and millions of views.
13:06 - And it's funny, it still
makes me laugh today.
13:09 - And it was the first
time I really realized
13:11 - that we could have hits with short video,
13:14 - with just a few minutes of videos
13:17 - generated by regular
people living their lives,
13:21 - sharing with the world their experiences.
13:25 - - That's wonderful.
13:26 - All right, so we have Prithvi,
13:28 - I'm not gonna say your last name,
13:30 - Vijaykrishnan from Bombay--
13:32 - - Yeah.
13:34 - Yeah.
13:35 - - Go ahead, what's your question?
13:37 - - [Susan] Hello?
- So what is your favorite
13:40 - type of YouTube video?
13:45 - - Well, I like a lot of
types of YouTube videos.
13:49 - And we're blessed at YouTube
13:51 - that we have so many
different types of videos.
13:53 - We have, of course, highlight videos,
14:00 - we have parody videos,
we have learning videos,
14:05 - we have a lot of people
14:06 - who are just sharing from their lives,
14:09 - user-generated videos, but I would say
14:11 - probably what I'm most
proud about at YouTube
14:14 - is the fact that we have
a lot of learning videos.
14:17 - And people tell me
14:19 - how they've been able
to change their lives
14:21 - by learning so much material on YouTube
14:23 - that otherwise they never would have had.
14:25 - And I think about YouTube
as a giant video library
14:30 - that has any information you wanna learn
14:34 - about anything in the world.
14:36 - And that is a free resource for
anyone to improve their life
14:40 - or to learn something new.
14:42 - And that's one of the areas of
YouTube I'm really proud of.
14:45 - We also have a ton of
entertainment as you know,
14:47 - and music videos, and (cuts off) videos.
14:49 - So all parts are in (cuts off)
14:51 - and it's the combination
of all these parts
14:53 - that make YouTube the
special place that it is.
14:59 - - And Kofi from Ghana has,
I think, a related question.
15:03 - - Yeah, yeah, my question is that,
15:06 - what learning videos do you or your kids
15:10 - like to watch on YouTube?
15:13 - - Which what, did you say?
15:17 - - What learning videos do you or your kids
15:19 - like to watch on YouTube?
15:26 - - I couldn't quite hear the question.
15:27 - I heard something, "Which
something do you and your--"
15:30 - - What learning videos
do you, yourself, watch--
15:33 - - Oh, which learning videos do we like?
15:35 - Well, probably my favorite learning videos
15:38 - to watch on YouTube are when
my kids ask me a question
15:40 - and I don't know the answer.
15:41 - And that actually happens a
lot, where they get stuck,
15:45 - they need help with Math or Physics
15:48 - or some kind of science
and I can't explain it.
15:51 - So I just say, "Hey, why
don't you go to YouTube
15:52 - "and look it up there?
15:53 - "I'm sure there are many
videos that explain that."
15:56 - And, usually, almost always,
15:59 - there are many choices from that.
16:01 - So that's one area that's important.
16:05 - I also say there's a lot of
nice exercise videos on YouTube.
16:07 - So whether you're interested
in yoga or fitness,
16:12 - especially when people are on quarantine,
16:13 - there are a lot of great
programs that we can do
16:15 - to just do exercise in our house,
16:17 - and those are really important,
especially right now.
16:20 - But thank you for your question.
16:22 - And I'm glad to see such an
international audience here.
16:25 - - Yeah, I bet you didn't expect
16:26 - you'd be speaking to people
from Africa and India,
16:30 - at the late time of their night right now.
16:32 - - Yeah, they're from every continent here.
16:34 - So it's great to see that.
16:37 - - So from Virginia, Layla has a question,
16:41 - in the United States.
- Okay.
16:42 - - What are you excited about
16:44 - in terms of future directions of YouTube?
16:51 - - Many things with YouTube
16:53 - that I'm excited about for the future.
16:56 - So I am excited about,
16:58 - certainly enabling the next
generation of creators.
17:02 - So we probably have lots
of people here on the call
17:05 - that at some point will
be a creator on YouTube,
17:08 - and so we're excited
about enabling all of you.
17:11 - And we think there's a lot of ways
17:12 - that video can continue to be developed,
17:16 - ways that we can make it
more interactive for people.
17:21 - I also think there are other areas
17:23 - that we're really just
getting started with like VR,
17:26 - where it can be really compelling
17:30 - but we just don't have
that many people right now
17:32 - who have access to VR
headsets or VR content,
17:36 - but I think that can be really
compelling in the future.
17:41 - And just continuing to grow
17:46 - all of the YouTubers out there
17:48 - who have so much wonderful
content to share with the world,
17:51 - and making sure people
can find it and grow it.
17:54 - So that's just some of the areas
17:56 - that we're invested in going forward.
17:59 - - I have two questions myself, Susan.
18:01 - The last week's episode,
18:02 - we talked about artificial
intelligence and machine learning
18:05 - and how computers can recognize patterns.
18:09 - How does YouTube views
AI and machine learning?
18:14 - - Yeah, so YouTube couldn't function
18:16 - without AI and machine learning
18:18 - because we use it in
every part of YouTube.
18:22 - So first of all,
18:23 - we use it in the
recommendations that we make.
18:25 - So when you come to YouTube
18:26 - and we need to decide which
video should we show you,
18:31 - we use machine learning
to try to figure that out
18:33 - in our recommendations.
18:35 - So YouTube has 500 hours of
video uploaded every minute.
18:40 - And so when you come to YouTube,
18:41 - we need to look over literally millions
18:45 - and millions of hours,
18:47 - and figure out what's the
right video to show you.
18:49 - And so we use machine learning for that.
18:51 - We also use machine learning
18:53 - to keep people safe on our platform.
18:55 - So we use it as a way of finding content
18:58 - that we think might not
meet our policy requirement.
19:01 - So something that would be a violation,
19:05 - like something that
would promote violence.
19:06 - So we use machine learning to find videos
19:08 - that we think would be a violation.
19:12 - I think about it, in terms of
our machine learning castle,
19:14 - a really big net, and then we have people
19:17 - who review those videos to see,
19:18 - is it true that they really
are violating our policies,
19:22 - but also all of that is
with machine learning.
19:27 - And, of course, our ads too.
19:28 - How do we decide which
ad to serve on a video?
19:30 - That's also based on machine learning.
19:32 - So pretty much everything we do at YouTube
19:34 - is based on machine learning.
19:36 - - That's not you personally
recommending the videos?
19:39 - - No, no.
19:41 - We have two billion users
19:43 - and 500 hours uploaded every minute.
19:46 - So in order to make that match
19:48 - between the billions of users
19:50 - and the millions and millions of videos,
19:54 - I mean, probably billions of videos,
19:55 - we need to use machine learning.
19:58 - And so, YouTube really only can exist
20:00 - because of machine learning.
20:02 - - Every minute, 500 hours of
new videos are added to YouTube
20:06 - by people on YouTube, it's crazy.
20:08 - - Yeah, so we need to figure it out.
20:10 - Is this a video everyone wants to watch
20:11 - or is this a video that is
a problem for our policies?
20:17 - There's no way we can do that with people,
20:19 - we can only do that with machines.
20:22 - - Yeah, one of the most interesting things
20:23 - that we talked about this last week
20:25 - is about how hard it is to
have machines enforce policies.
20:29 - And you have humans deciding
what the policies are,
20:31 - but you can't have the humans themselves
20:33 - watching every video and how you need
20:35 - to basically build the
technology to enforce policies.
20:38 - And when those policies are deciding
20:41 - what you can show to people or not,
20:45 - it's a complicated issue,
and I know you're under--
20:47 - - It is very complicated.
20:49 - And we also make sure
20:50 - that machines learn the right thing.
20:52 - So that's the other thing
that happens sometimes.
20:54 - So we give the machines a set of videos
20:58 - that are an example of the videos
21:01 - that are violating our policy,
21:02 - but we need to make sure that
they learn the right lesson.
21:05 - And if they don't, then we retrain them
21:07 - so they start learning and
finding the right videos.
21:12 - - So I wanna take a little
break from questions
21:14 - and introduce our Computer
Science topic of today,
21:18 - which is abstraction.
21:20 - And we're gonna do a quick lesson
21:22 - with everybody, including Susan.
21:23 - So abstraction is a concept
that we use all the time,
21:27 - not just in Computer Science.
21:28 - And what it basically means is
taking something complicated
21:31 - and making it really simple.
21:33 - So that when you have a
bunch of complicated details
21:36 - that you don't wanna care about,
21:37 - you can really simplify them down.
21:39 - For example, if I were to
give Susan driving directions
21:43 - to get from my house to Sofia's school,
21:46 - I wouldn't start by saying,
"Open the garage door,
21:49 - "open the car door, get in the car,
21:53 - "take the key out of pockets,
put the key in the ignition."
21:57 - I would just say, "Get out of the street
21:59 - "and take a right turn."
22:00 - And you wouldn't need me
to say, "Put your hand
22:02 - "on the steering wheel,"
and all those little steps
22:04 - because we know how to do those things.
22:06 - We abstract them away and
just say high level words
22:09 - like, "Go on the freeway
North and take exit 15."
22:13 - I wanna show how we can, all
of us together very quickly,
22:16 - learn similarly to basically
go from really detailed steps
22:21 - to release simple commands
using abstraction.
22:24 - So please follow along with me,
22:25 - and, Susan again, if you
aren't in the gallery view
22:29 - to see everybody's
faces, go into this view
22:32 - and we're gonna make sure
everybody at home sees that.
22:34 - So I'm gonna give you
commands to all follow along.
22:37 - So everybody raise your
hand up like me and Sofia.
22:43 - All right, now make a fist.
22:44 - And if you're at home, even
if you're not on camera,
22:47 - do the same thing.
22:48 - Right, now stick out your thumb.
22:51 - Right, let's call this the number one.
22:53 - This isn't really how we
show the number one anywhere,
22:55 - but let's just pretend
that's how we're doing it.
22:57 - All right, now lower your hand.
23:00 - That was the number one.
23:02 - Now do it again, pick up your hand,
23:04 - make a fist, stick out your pinky finger.
23:09 - Let's call this the number two, all right?
23:13 - Now put your hand back down.
23:15 - All right, and now we're
gonna learn a third number.
23:17 - Raise up your hand, everybody.
23:20 - Make a fist, stick out your
thumb and your pinky finger,
23:24 - and if you want, you can
wiggle it like Sofia just did.
23:27 - Let's call this the number three.
23:30 - So we've just learned
a very simple language
23:33 - with three numbers, and using abstraction,
23:35 - instead of giving you
all those instructions,
23:37 - I can repeat them again.
23:38 - Susan, did you get that
complex language we just--
23:41 - - I think so.
23:42 - I think so, I think I can handle that.
23:45 - - All right, so now I'm gonna
use a more high-level command.
23:49 - I'm just gonna say,
using that new language,
23:51 - count down from three to one
23:55 - as I'm gonna count out loud.
23:56 - So three and then two,
24:03 - and then one.
24:06 - And what we did, basically,
24:08 - I didn't need to say, "Pick up your hand,
24:09 - "make a fist, do this and that."
24:11 - Once you learn what a three looks like
24:13 - and what a two looks like
and what a one looks like,
24:15 - you can abstract away those details.
24:18 - Abstraction is so critical
to Computer Science
24:20 - and generally to communication.
24:22 - It's what enables us to build
24:24 - really complicated computer programs
24:27 - without having to look
through millions and millions
24:29 - and even billions of lines of code.
24:33 - We're gonna learn more about
how to do that on a computer,
24:35 - but I wanna finish some of
our questions with Susan.
24:38 - And we have some questions,
actually, from the audience.
24:41 - So I'm gonna introduce Leo Ortiz
24:44 - to ask these questions for us.
24:46 - Akira, who usually produces Code Break
24:48 - and asks the audience questions
isn't here with us today.
24:51 - So Leo, are you there with us?
24:52 - Can you join us?
24:53 - - I heard a yes.
24:54 - And hi, Susan?
24:56 - We got dozens and dozens of questions,
24:58 - we're gonna read a couple of them.
24:59 - Lily Grayson from Washington State,
25:02 - she asks, "What challenges
have you encountered
25:05 - "getting to this stage in your career,
25:08 - "and do you have a message for
young girls, in particular,
25:11 - "based on your experiences?"
25:14 - - Yeah.
25:15 - Well, I've definitely
experienced lots of challenges.
25:21 - I don't think anyone ever has setbacks.
25:23 - Everybody has setbacks along the way.
25:26 - And I would say the message
that I have for young girls
25:30 - is that Computer Science
25:32 - is a really valuable and important field.
25:35 - And I really care about that a lot
25:37 - because they see that we just
don't have enough young girls
25:40 - and we don't have enough
women in Computer Science.
25:42 - And that's really a problem
because all of the future world
25:47 - that we're building is
gonna need Computer Science.
25:50 - And so we wanna make
sure that that's a world
25:52 - that's represented by everybody,
25:54 - regardless of their backgrounds.
25:56 - And I'll tell you my story.
26:01 - I never thought I'd be
interested in Computer Science.
26:04 - I never, ever like considered
that when I was younger,
26:09 - and that was probably for many reasons
26:10 - like we didn't really have
as many options (cuts off)
26:14 - but I love doing creative things.
26:17 - I love making art projects
and building things.
26:23 - And when I discovered, by
accident, Computer Science,
26:29 - I realized that I could build things
26:32 - that everyone in the world
could see and could use,
26:35 - and that I could just take a few classes
26:39 - and that would enable me
26:41 - to do a huge amount of work in the future.
26:44 - And I was actually a senior in college
26:48 - when I discovered that.
26:50 - And I thought I was too
old and it was too late
26:52 - for me to change careers,
26:55 - but I decided I would just
take the classes anyway,
26:58 - and those classes changed my life.
27:00 - And I've seen it with my own kids,
27:05 - that it's really important to
have it and to not give up,
27:09 - and that everyone is
capable of learning it.
27:13 - Everyone, no matter who you are,
27:14 - no matter what your background is,
27:16 - you are capable of learning it,
27:18 - and you will need it for the future
27:19 - just like you need Math,
just like you need Reading.
27:22 - It doesn't mean you're
gonna become a mathematician
27:24 - because you take Math.
27:26 - It doesn't mean you're gonna mean be
27:27 - an English professor because
you learn how to read,
27:30 - but you do need those basic skills
27:32 - to do everything else in the world.
27:34 - And the same thing is for Computer Science
27:36 - in the world, going forward.
27:38 - You will need it, and it
will open up a lot of doors.
27:40 - So I really encourage you all to take it
27:43 - and to stick with it,
27:44 - and I wanna, again,
emphasize, this is something
27:48 - that everybody can learn.
27:49 - Everyone, no matter
who your background is,
27:51 - where you are, you can learn it.
27:55 - - In a related question, Don
Wu and Rico Sri from Dubai,
27:59 - they ask, "Do you have any
advice for young people
28:01 - "interested in the field
of technology today?"
28:09 - - So my advice for people interested
28:10 - in the field of technology today,
28:12 - is to, well, first of all,
to have a understanding
28:16 - of Computer Science.
28:18 - That will always open up doors,
28:20 - if you understand how technology is made,
28:23 - and, again, you don't
need to have that much
28:25 - because it's always changing.
28:26 - You just need to have a
willingness to wanna learn
28:29 - and to keep learning
as technology changes.
28:33 - And I think the other thing
28:35 - that I would encourage people to do
28:38 - is just be curious and explore.
28:44 - And there are so many ways
28:47 - that technology is changing our world,
28:49 - and so it's possible that
you'll discover some area
28:53 - that hasn't yet been explored by people
28:57 - and that you have some ideas that are new.
28:59 - And I really think that that could happen
29:02 - because there's just so many opportunities
29:04 - that are still out there.
29:06 - And so I would encourage you to explore
29:10 - and ask lots of questions and have fun,
29:13 - get together with your friends,
29:15 - think about projects of things
that would be useful to you.
29:19 - That's one way to think about.
29:21 - If you ever are doing
something, you're like,
29:23 - "Wait, why does it not work this way?
29:25 - "It really should work this other way.
29:26 - "It would be so much better."
29:28 - Get together with your friends
29:29 - and think about how you could change that
29:32 - because you probably could,
and this is the time to do it.
29:39 - And don't give up.
29:42 - If one idea doesn't work
out, just find another idea.
29:44 - There are a million, you'll
find another good idea.
29:47 - And just keep at it, and
don't let anyone tell you
29:50 - that you are too young,
that you couldn't do it.
29:54 - I'm sure you can do it.
29:56 - Just be persistent and keep working on it.
29:59 - - Tinkering, creativity, and persistence
30:01 - are all so important
30:03 - for people studying Computer Science.
30:05 - Thank you so much for your advice, Susan,
30:07 - and for joining us today.
30:08 - And we're gonna switch to,
again, to gallery view,
30:10 - so all the students on camera,
30:11 - if we could unmute everybody
30:12 - to wave goodbye to Susan as we thank her.
30:15 - - [Students] Bye.
30:19 - - Bye, everybody.
30:21 - (audience talking drowns out Susan)
30:27 - - I'd like to welcome
our next special guest,
30:29 - actress and singer, China Anne McClain.
30:31 - Hi, China?
30:34 - - Hello, how are you?
30:35 - Can you hear me?
30:36 - - I can hear you and I saw you earlier
30:39 - joining us for counting one, two, three.
30:41 - - Yeah, you saw me.
30:43 - Three, two, one. (laughs)
30:46 - - Where are you calling us from?
30:48 - - I'm calling from Georgia,
I am at my home right now.
30:52 - - Georgia, wow, and do you have any words
30:55 - you wanna share with the students
who are studying at home?
30:57 - And as you see, the students here
30:58 - are from every continent
and all over the world.
31:02 - - Yeah, yeah, I can see.
31:04 - I'm just really proud of you guys.
31:06 - I think that it's really incredible
31:08 - that you're all this interested
31:11 - in something as extensive and
awesome as Computer Science.
31:15 - I'm really proud.
31:16 - And seeing all of your
little faces on this chat,
31:19 - it really does give me a
lot of hope for the future.
31:21 - So you guys, stick with it.
31:22 - Seriously, stick with it.
31:23 - Like Susan said, anyone can
learn it and you guys can do it.
31:28 - - Absolutely.
31:30 - One of the most important things
31:31 - as you see from the folks here
31:32 - is the diversity of the faces.
31:36 - The field of tech and Computer Science
31:38 - is predominantly white, and
it's predominantly male.
31:43 - And what's fantastic is
watching the next generation
31:46 - of students who are
basically representing,
31:48 - obviously, like my daughter Sofia,
31:50 - and there's so many students
from all over the world.
31:54 - The young folks here are changing the face
31:55 - of Computer Science, and
together they're gonna help us
31:58 - build a better future.
32:01 - - Yes, they are.
32:01 - And go ahead, Sofia.
32:02 - I see you representing
32:03 - for the women in the
field, the young women.
32:05 - Go ahead, girl. (laughs)
32:08 - Oh, she's so cute.
32:10 - - Thank you.
32:11 - But we wanna, before we go into
the next part of our lesson,
32:13 - we wanna take a break for
a quick trivia question.
32:16 - It's trivia time.
(playful sound effects)
32:19 - Sofia makes sound effects.
32:21 - So we have a question,
32:22 - what was the very first smartphone,
32:25 - and if you don't see the poll on screen
32:26 - those of you who are on
YouTube Live watching,
32:30 - was the first smartphone the iPhone 1,
32:33 - the Palm Treo, the Simon
Personal Communicator,
32:38 - the BlackBerry 5810, or the Pocket PC
32:43 - with Windows Mobile from Microsoft?
32:46 - There's lots of choices.
32:48 - China, what was your first smartphone?
32:51 - - Oh, my gosh.
32:53 - Is it sad that I don't even remember?
32:55 - I don't even think it was
able to take photos. (laughs)
32:58 - - I have multiple of my
first smartphones here
33:02 - for just those trivia questions.
33:03 - Sofia is really embarrassed (mumbles)
33:06 - So this is the iPhone 1 right here.
33:14 - - Yes.
33:15 - - This is a BlackBerry,
33:17 - the first BlackBerry phone that came out,
33:20 - and this here is the Palm Phone.
33:25 - They actually still work.
33:27 - I actually used the iPhone
(laughs) a few days ago
33:30 - just to test that it works,
33:31 - but I'm gonna share the screen.
33:32 - Actually, look, can we show
what the students guessed
33:35 - were the results?
33:36 - - Mm-hmm, they guess the BlackBerry 5810.
33:38 - - BlackBerry came, yeah.
33:41 - So now I wanna actually
do a quick screen share
33:44 - to show the answers.
33:47 - So where is my screen share?
33:50 - Thanks, Sofia.
33:51 - So what you can see is the iPhone 1
33:55 - is what a lot of people think,
33:56 - but that actually, of the list,
33:58 - was the most recent of the
smartphones, not the Palm Treo,
34:02 - not the Microsoft Pocket
PC, not the Blackberry,
34:06 - but the Simon Personal--
34:08 - - Yeah.
34:09 - - Look at this bad boy made
in 1992, so 28 years ago.
34:15 - This was the first smartphone.
34:17 - So I always love learning something new
34:19 - with Computer Science trivia.
34:22 - - (laughs) That is dope.
34:24 - I wanna get me one of those. (laughs)
34:26 - - Carry that around?
34:28 - I don't know if you can
tweet with it, though.
34:31 - I didn't see if it had a full
on keyboard for using Twitter.
34:34 - - It didn't look like it did.
34:35 - (laughs) Look at her
holding that phone up.
34:38 - That means you took really good care of it
34:40 - if they still work, good for you.
34:42 - - Yeah, it's pretty amazing
that they still work.
34:45 - We're gonna skip into learning our next
34:47 - part of today's lesson about abstraction.
34:49 - We're gonna learn about using functions.
34:51 - And a function is a type of abstraction.
34:54 - Remember earlier when we
were holding up our numbers,
34:56 - one, two, and three, and
I didn't need to repeat
34:59 - all the commands, I just
said, "Show the number one,"
35:00 - and you knew how to do it?
35:02 - Functions are basically the
exact same thing in code.
35:06 - When you write a bunch of code,
35:08 - if you wanna do the same
thing over and over again,
35:10 - you don't need to repeat all
the code you wrote earlier,
35:13 - you use a function to do it.
35:14 - And I'm gonna demo this in a
game that I started building,
35:18 - and then Sofia is gonna finish that game.
35:20 - And as Susan was talking
about projects and tinkering
35:22 - and creativity, that's exactly
what we're gonna do here.
35:25 - We're gonna tinker with a
project that I already started.
35:28 - So what we have here
is a game on Code.org.
35:30 - Just to first of all show
what's happening on the screen,
35:33 - on the left side here is where this game
35:35 - is gonna be playing.
35:36 - On the right side here is all the code,
35:38 - and some of this is already started,
35:40 - and here are the commands
for all the other things
35:43 - we could add to the game.
35:46 - So I'm gonna start by
just looking at the code.
35:48 - You can see when we run the code here,
35:50 - it does this thing called game setup.
35:52 - What does game setup mean?
35:54 - This is a function.
35:55 - And if I click, you can see all the code
35:57 - that is involved in game set up,
35:59 - but you don't need to
know those details, right?
36:01 - It just says game set up.
36:03 - And then up here it says
when I hit the Right key,
36:06 - move this little rabbit east,
36:08 - and when I hit the Left key, move it west.
36:10 - So Sofia, we're gonna hit Run,
36:12 - and then you're gonna use your
mouse to click on these keys
36:15 - to control that little rabbit,
36:18 - to move him right and left.
36:21 - Go.
36:23 - So you can click Right and Left
36:24 - and when you hit the Down button,
36:26 - the rabbit drops little
carrots to make stew.
36:29 - Your rabbit is making carrot stew.
36:35 - (scorestreak chimes)
36:36 - So each time you do it,
36:37 - it also shows how much stew you've made.
36:40 - Right, so that's a pretty simple game.
36:41 - You're making carrot stew.
36:43 - And if you look here, and
here's the code that says,
36:44 - "When the Down button is pressed,
36:46 - "make a new carrot and have
the carrot move south."
36:50 - And by the way, China,
36:51 - if you haven't seen code that
looks like this, you can...
36:54 - Usually, when you see
code, it looks like this
36:57 - and it's a whole bunch of
texts, but we're using blocks,
37:00 - which is basically the same concept,
37:02 - it's just a little bit
easier with a younger age.
37:05 - So here is the code for what happens.
37:06 - When one of those carrots
hits one of these empty pots,
37:10 - it plays the sound, the carrot disappears,
37:13 - and we change the pot into stew.
37:15 - And we then print something.
37:17 - But I wanna write the
code and add the code
37:19 - for what happens when the
carrot hits this hungry rabbit.
37:21 - See this little brown rabbit
that was going back and forth?
37:24 - So what should we do when the
carrot hits the hungry rabbit?
37:27 - What do you think, China?
37:31 - - I don't know, you tell me.
37:33 - - How about we have the
hungry rabbit eat the carrot
37:36 - so it can't go into the stew?
37:37 - Does that work?
37:38 - - Aww, I guess so.
37:40 - I would have liked him to
drink the stew, but sure.
37:43 - (Hadi laughs)
(China laughs)
37:45 - - It's standing in the way and
since it's a computer game,
37:47 - the hungry rabbit's our bad guy.
37:49 - So Sofia, we wanna add some code.
37:52 - When the carrot hits the hungry rabbit,
37:54 - we wanna make the carrot disappear.
37:55 - So go under Sprites and remove the carrot.
38:00 - So don't remove the good
guy, just take that out,
38:04 - you wanna remove the carrot.
38:06 - And we learned earlier
that the way to do this
38:08 - is by taking this sprite.
38:09 - You wanna remove this sprite,
38:11 - which is the subject of this one block.
38:14 - So in the event that that
happens, we remove the carrot.
38:17 - We should also play a sound,
38:19 - so go into into the World
category and pick up Play Sound.
38:24 - Oh, and when we get to choose
what sound we wanna do.
38:28 - So we click Choose and click
here where it says Collect,
38:32 - and China, I want your
help choosing the sound
38:34 - when hungry rabbit eats the carrot.
38:36 - So let's try the lead options.
38:38 - Clicky crunch.
38:40 - (crunch clicks)
38:41 - (China laughs)
38:42 - Bar recharge.
38:43 - (Bar recharges)
38:44 - And then health pack.
38:45 - (health pack chimes)
38:46 - - (mumbles)
38:49 - - I like clicky crunch.
38:51 - - Clicky crunch?
(clicking crunch)
38:52 - - Yeah. (laughs)
38:53 - - All right, let's
choose that as the sound
38:55 - for when our hungry
rabbit eats the carrot.
38:58 - Right, so now the carrot disappears,
39:00 - but there's some other
stuff we can do as well.
39:02 - We want to, basically, lose the lives.
39:05 - If you look at the top of
the screen, it says Lives: 3.
39:08 - We wanna lose lives each
time the hungry rabbit
39:10 - catches our carrot.
39:11 - So to reduce lives, lives is a variable,
39:14 - which we learned about a few weeks ago.
39:16 - Go under the Variables category,
39:18 - and see where it says Change i by one?
39:21 - Oh, no, not that one.
39:23 - Change i by one, that'll
change our variable,
39:26 - And we wanna change the entry for lives.
39:29 - So instead of changing i, change lives.
39:33 - No, that's two.
- That's two (laughs)
39:35 - Lives.
39:36 - And you don't wanna increase
the number of lives,
39:38 - you wanna decrease them.
39:39 - So instead of changing them by one,
39:41 - we wanna change them by negative one.
39:43 - All right, and now you can also print
39:45 - the number of lives you have left.
39:47 - There is a print block here,
39:48 - and if you hit Command C, Command V,
39:51 - you can make a copy of that block,
39:54 - that's gonna print out how
many lives we have left.
39:57 - That's the code that prints
how many stew you have,
39:59 - but now we can have how
many lives we have left.
40:01 - - It still says stew.
40:03 - Why do I keep clicking the wrong line?
40:05 - - It's okay.
40:06 - You can change the lives.
40:11 - - (mumbles)
40:13 - All right, so now let's run
it and see how it works.
40:19 - All right, so now Sofia has--
40:21 - - (mumbles)
40:21 - (scorestreak chimes)
(China laughs)
40:24 - - So Sofia negative 10 lives left.
40:28 - She made two stews and negative 10 lives.
40:31 - Is there something we've forgotten?
40:32 - What does negative 10 lives mean?
40:34 - (Sofia laughs)
40:35 - How many negative lives
do you have, China?
40:38 - - Negative lives?
40:40 - A lot, more than 10.
40:42 - - What usually happens in a computer game
40:45 - when you start losing too many lives
40:46 - and when you go past zero,
what happens usually?
40:50 - - You lose.
40:51 - - You lose.
40:52 - So what we didn't do is we didn't check
40:54 - if we ran out of lives.
40:56 - And if you look at this code up here,
40:57 - it has this function called
Check If Game Is Over.
41:00 - And we can actually drag this block,
41:03 - check if game is over,
and add it over here.
41:07 - And Sofia, can you click the edit button?
41:10 - Because that function
41:11 - doesn't do everything we want it to do.
41:12 - Right now, it says, "If
the stew is five, you win."
41:17 - So you win when you get five stews.
41:19 - But we wanna say you would lose
41:23 - if you get down to zero lives.
41:25 - So click this entire if thing and copy it
41:26 - and paste it with Command C, Command V.
41:31 - - So.
41:32 - - All right, and now instead of checking
41:33 - if the stew equals five,
41:35 - check if the lives equals lives equals--
41:38 - - Zero.
41:39 - - Lives equals zero,
and right now it says,
41:41 - "You win! Play again."
41:42 - China, can you tell us something
else to put over there?
41:44 - - It should, unfortunately,
say, "You Lose, Try Again."
41:48 - - You Lose Try Again.
41:52 - Include Sorry, so we can be nice to it.
41:55 - - Yeah, sorry, (laughs) right.
41:58 - I would put a smiley face
too, but that's okay. (laughs)
42:01 - - (laughs) So let's also
now change the sound
42:04 - because the winning sound is not so great.
42:09 - What sound should we put?
42:10 - So let's search for losing sounds.
42:13 - So we can get bunch of losing sounds,
42:15 - and I was going over these earlier.
42:16 - So here's a bunch of fun losing sounds.
42:19 - There's the female voiceover,
42:21 - - [Female Voiceover] You lose.
42:23 - - (laughs) which is a very
aggressive, "You lose."
42:27 - There is the 8bit Game Over sound,
42:30 - (8bit game over sound)
42:34 - and then there's the
42:35 - crackle loss sound.
(crackle loss sound)
42:38 - - Aww.
42:39 - - And let's have the students do a poll
42:41 - to choose between those.
42:42 - The female You Lose sound,
the 8bit game over sound,
42:46 - and the crackle loss sound.
42:47 - Can we put a poll up on screen to choose?
42:53 - All right, so now all the students.
42:58 - (China laughs)
42:59 - All right, so there's...
43:01 - Oh, my gosh.
43:01 - There is an obvious winner
and it's not what I expected.
43:06 - China, do you see the
votes that are coming in?
43:08 - - I do, oh, oh.
43:11 - - All right, almost everybody's voted,
43:13 - this is not what I thought
you people would choose.
43:14 - (China laughs)
43:15 - And now, let's share the vote results.
43:17 - (bell chimes)
43:18 - It sounds like people want
the female voiceover sound.
43:22 - - You lose.
43:24 - - You lose.
43:25 - (China laughs)
43:26 - - Now, was that you saying that, China?
43:27 - - That was me, was it good?
43:29 - - Yeah, that's pretty good.
43:30 - Choose that sound, Sofia.
43:33 - - [Female Voiceover] You lose.
43:34 - - That's right.
43:36 - Now, let me close this.
43:37 - All right, so, and that's basically it
43:39 - for our little gameOver function.
43:41 - Now that we checked this game is over,
43:43 - we've written that code inside here,
43:45 - we don't need to deal with it ever again
43:46 - to learn about the details,
43:48 - and I think our game is finished now.
43:49 - So hit Run.
43:51 - - We're trying to lose
here to test our new code.
43:54 - (rabbit purrs)
43:55 - (scorestreak sound)
43:57 - - Oh, no.
43:58 - - [Female Voiceover] You lose.
43:59 - - Oh.
44:00 - - But it said sorry.
44:01 - It said sorry, that's nice.
44:04 - Right, do you want another game, Sofia?
44:06 - Because you haven't won yet.
44:08 - - Now, I'll run.
44:09 - Run.
44:11 - - All right, let's see
if she can win this game.
44:13 - (scorestreak chimes)
44:15 - Then stew.
44:16 - - And that's a little risky.
44:17 - - That was risky.
- That's what I need to do.
44:19 - I am gonna--
44:20 - - You have only one life left.
44:21 - - [Female Voiceover] You lose.
44:22 - (laughing)
44:24 - All right, so one thing you can do,
44:27 - now that we've written this
game is we can share it out.
44:30 - So I can say Share Your
Projects, and here is a QR code.
44:33 - And, in fact, every student,
44:35 - if you have a phone and are watching this,
44:36 - and China, you can do this if you want,
44:37 - if you have your phone and use the camera,
44:41 - you can scan the QR code,
this little code here,
44:45 - and you'll get a little
notification on your phone,
44:47 - and then the code that
Sofia and you and I wrote,
44:51 - you can click on that and you
have our little game up there.
44:54 - Look at that, please.
44:56 - Is that pretty cool?
44:58 - - Oh, my gosh.
45:00 - Oh, wow.
45:02 - - So the sounds you chose
45:03 - and the app we just made
45:04 - is now on your phone, which is cool.
45:07 - (laughs)
45:09 - Yeah, isn't that awesome?
45:11 - - That is awesome. (laughs)
45:13 - - (laughs) That's part
of the joy of creativity
45:16 - with Computer Science and coding.
45:17 - And for anybody who didn't have a phone
45:18 - because you had only one device,
45:21 - we're gonna be emailing you that game
45:22 - at the end of this episode,
45:23 - so you can actually change it
45:24 - and make improvements yourself.
45:27 - And what's exciting about
Computer Science, basically,
45:29 - is the creativity of basically
making something your own
45:32 - and changing it, and we have
a bunch of modifications
45:35 - for things we want to
let you add to your game.
45:40 - Now, before we get to the
next segment of the episode,
45:42 - we wanna do a lightning round
of questions with China.
45:45 - So you're our fifth special guest
45:47 - to play our lightning round game.
45:49 - We're gonna put 60 seconds on the clock,
45:52 - and Sophia has an app that we made
45:53 - that's gonna keep score.
45:55 - Your goal is to get through
as many questions as possible.
45:58 - - Oh, goodness.
45:59 - - Yeah, and we want quality and quantity,
46:02 - but we're measuring based on quantity.
46:04 - And our current high
score was 14 questions
46:07 - answered in 60 seconds by Macklemore.
46:11 - It's unlikely doing that, but can try.
46:13 - So Sofia, are you ready?
46:15 - - Yeah.
46:16 - - China, are you ready?
46:17 - - Yes, I am.
46:17 - - [Hadi] Okay, go.
- Go.
46:20 - - [Sofia] Favorite drink?
46:22 - - Sprite.
46:23 - - [Sofia] You favorite smell?
46:25 - - Outdoors.
46:27 - - [Sofia] An activity you can get
46:28 - easily sucked into four hours?
46:31 - - Scrolling through TikTok.
46:33 - - [Sofia] Something you can eat everyday.
46:35 - - What do I eat every day?
46:39 - What was that?
46:39 - - [Sofia] Something you can eat everyday.
46:42 - - Pizza, unfortunately.
46:43 - - [Sofia] Best book you've ever read.
46:46 - - The Bible.
46:48 - - [Sofia] Something you can't ever eat
46:49 - no matter how many people love it.
46:53 - - I don't like onions, I'm sorry.
46:55 - - [Sofia] As a kid,
what did you want to be
46:56 - when you grew up?
46:59 - - A singer.
47:01 - - [Sofia] What are your feelings
about pineapple on pizza?
47:05 - - I love it, I don't get the hate.
47:07 - - [Sofia] The last person you
hugged, not living with you.
47:12 - - Probably my friend, Lauren Norris,
47:15 - or a fan that I met.
47:17 - Go ahead.
47:18 - - [Sofia] Something you
know all the words to,
47:20 - oh, no, okay, that's--
47:22 - - [Hadi] Oh, we're out of time.
47:23 - What was your score?
47:25 - - [Sofia] It was was nine.
47:26 - - [Hadi] You're score was nine.
47:27 - Gosh, I don't even know
how Macklemore got to 14.
47:30 - - I think it was--
- I know, he was giving
47:31 - one word answers. (laughs)
47:34 - - All right, well,
47:36 - (clapping sound effects)
47:37 - China, do you have any last messages
47:39 - for our students at home?
47:40 - I know you're out of time.
47:41 - Do you have any closing comments
47:43 - you wanna share with the students?
47:44 - Any words of inspiration?
47:46 - - I would just say that in this field
47:49 - or whatever field you are in,
47:51 - honestly, I've taken this into acting
47:53 - and in everything that
I do, don't give up.
47:57 - Don't be discouraged,
don't let anybody tell you
47:59 - that you can not do something.
48:01 - Anytime I hear that, it makes
my mind moves even harder
48:06 - and I want it even more.
48:07 - So don't give up, and yeah.
48:11 - That's all I would say.
48:12 - That's all I would say to you, guys.
48:13 - And I'm very, very proud
of you once again. (laughs)
48:17 - - Thank you so much.
48:18 - And I hope you learned a
little bit of something
48:19 - with us today as well.
48:21 - - [China] I definitely did.
48:22 - - Let's switch to gallery view
48:24 - so we can see all the students on screen,
48:26 - and wave goodbye to China.
48:29 - - Bye, guys, love you.
48:32 - Three, two, one. (laughs)
48:34 - - All right, bye, bye.
48:36 - And now we're also gonna
say goodbye to Sofia.
48:39 - She's gonna be leaving as well,
48:40 - and we're gonna be
joined by my son, Darius.
48:43 - Darius, I'm gonna shift over and--
48:45 - - Hi.
48:46 - - Hi, Darius.
48:47 - Darius is 13 and he's
48:49 - a slightly more advanced
computer programmer.
48:52 - And for our last segment today,
48:53 - we wanna talk about libraries.
48:57 - This is a portion about abstraction.
48:58 - We learned about how functions work,
49:02 - and libraries is something really exciting
49:04 - that we actually just added
to Code.org this week,
49:07 - and it's a really important
concept and capability.
49:11 - So a library in Computer Science
49:13 - is a lot like a library in the real world.
49:15 - In the real world, anytime
you want to get a book
49:18 - that you don't have, if
somebody else wrote that book,
49:20 - you can go to the library and
borrow it and then read it.
49:23 - In computer science,
49:25 - if there is code that somebody else wrote
49:27 - and you want to reuse that person's code,
49:30 - you can basically use a library
49:32 - that lets you use the functions
that somebody else created,
49:36 - without having to learn how they work
49:37 - and all the little details,
49:39 - you can basically use their code as well.
49:41 - And to introduce this, I'm
gonna invite Hannah on screen.
49:45 - Hannah is one of Code.org's
49:46 - Computer Science Curriculum Creators.
49:49 - She used to be a teacher herself,
49:51 - and then she used to help prepare
49:52 - other Computer Science teachers,
49:54 - and now she is one of the authors
49:55 - of our CS Principles Course,
which is the most popular
49:58 - high school Computer Science
course in the United States.
50:01 - So Hannah, can you join us and
show us how libraries work?
50:05 - - Hi, Hadi, I am happy
to show our new tool.
50:08 - I'm super excited about this.
50:10 - So I'm going to share my screen now.
50:13 - And what you'll see is a program.
50:19 - And in this program, I have lots and lots
50:23 - and lots and lots of lines of code.
50:27 - But what's really cool about this code
50:29 - is all of this code can be
contained within functions.
50:34 - And what's great about a
library, as Hadi was saying,
50:37 - is I can take these functions
50:38 - and I can share them with somebody else.
50:41 - So, for example, I've got this
first big green block here,
50:44 - and this is my butterfly function.
50:46 - And inside of my butterfly function,
50:48 - I've got directions for
how to draw a butterfly,
50:51 - and I've also got, right
here, another function
50:55 - that I'm calling To Draw
a Part of the Wings.
50:58 - And I'm actually gonna
show you how this works.
51:01 - So I'm gonna call my butterfly function.
51:04 - And if you notice up here,
51:06 - it takes two different parameters.
51:08 - So two pieces of information
I have to give it.
51:10 - So I'm gonna say a size of 10,
51:13 - and let's say a pink butterfly.
51:17 - Oh, I did not run my
program, gotta do that first.
51:19 - Let's try that again,
butterfly(10, "pink").
51:25 - Okay, so there we go.
51:27 - So I've got a pink
butterfly on the screen,
51:29 - and you'll see right here,
51:30 - it draws wings and this
is this bottom set,
51:33 - and then I call another
function drawings again,
51:37 - to draw these top wings
at a different size.
51:40 - So you can see that I can
reuse functions several times,
51:44 - just like we did in
the Sprite Lab project,
51:46 - and I can do that all within
this butterfly function.
51:50 - Now, I have functions here for grass,
51:53 - I have functions for flowers
and for ants, and for clovers,
51:57 - all sorts of things to draw
interesting things on my screen.
52:00 - But what's really fun about libraries
52:02 - is that it's not about
what I draw my screen,
52:04 - it's about what somebody else
can make with my functions.
52:08 - So I'm gonna show you now how this works.
52:10 - So I'm gonna click on Share,
52:12 - and then I'm going to
click Share As Library.
52:15 - And once I click that,
52:17 - now I have the option to choose
the functions I want to send
52:22 - to anybody in the world.
52:23 - But first I need to give it a description,
52:25 - so they know what's in this library.
52:27 - So I'm gonna say, "A
collection of drawings to--
52:33 - - So can you send that library to us
52:34 - to make some code using it?
52:36 - - Absolutely.
52:37 - - I mean, we can use all the
functions she just created.
52:39 - - [Hannah] All right.
- That's great.
52:40 - - So I'm gonna choose some functions
52:42 - to send over to Hadi and Darius.
52:43 - I'm gonna send the butterfly,
the grass, the flower,
52:46 - the ant, clover, ladybug.
52:49 - So those are the functions
that I'm gonna send.
52:52 - And I'm going to click Publish.
52:53 - And once I do that, I am going to get
52:56 - a special code right here.
52:58 - And this code, I can copy and
I can send it over to anybody,
53:03 - and I'm gonna send it right
now over to Hadi and Darius
53:07 - who are going to make
something with my library.
53:11 - - All right, Darius, are
you ready to check this out?
53:15 - - Yup.
53:16 - - So we've already started making an app
53:18 - that's gonna draw,
basically, an outdoor scene,
53:21 - and we were ready to get this
library of code from you.
53:25 - So here is this app that I started.
53:26 - And, basically, the idea
here, this is in design mode,
53:30 - the idea is to basically have an app where
53:33 - if you run it, you can choose
how many clovers you want
53:36 - or how many flowers you want
or how many butterflies,
53:39 - and you click this little pencil
and it draws them for you.
53:43 - But right now it doesn't work.
53:44 - If I click it, it basically does nothing
53:46 - because we don't have the code to do that.
53:49 - We needed to add the code
for drawing the clovers
53:51 - and flowers and butterflies,
and we can only do that
53:53 - using the new library you made for us.
53:55 - So to add that, you need
to go to this little gear
53:58 - in the upper right of the toolbox--
54:00 - - That one?
54:01 - - Yeah, and choose Manage Libraries.
54:04 - All right, and see where it
says Import Library From ID,
54:07 - click there, and I'll hit Command V
54:09 - to enter the code that Hannah gave us.
54:13 - And now I'm gonna hit Add,
54:14 - that's gonna add the library
54:17 - of all the functions that Hannah has made.
54:20 - She wrote those functions
54:22 - and they were on her computer,
54:24 - but now we can actually access them.
54:26 - So we're here in an App Lab in code mode,
54:28 - and you can see there's all
these different categories
54:30 - of all the commands inside App Lab,
54:32 - but if I click under
Functions, look at that.
54:35 - There's six new functions.
54:38 - These blocks didn't exist before.
54:39 - We just added these blocks to App Lab.
54:42 - They are the code that Hannah wrote,
54:45 - and now we can use them in our project
54:46 - to do anything we want with them.
54:48 - - Whoa.
54:49 - - Isn't that pretty cool?
- What about the functions
54:50 - inside the functions--
54:52 - - Those still work.
- Oh, that's cool.
54:54 - - Which means also that
anything you create as code,
54:56 - you can share as the library,
54:57 - somebody can use it in their code,
54:59 - or they can use that to
make an even bigger library,
55:01 - and that's how so much of
Computer Science works.
55:04 - Not everybody creates
everything from nothing,
55:07 - they build on the work of other people.
55:09 - So now, if you look at this
code that we have right now,
55:13 - I've already started up here.
55:15 - Basically, this is what happens
55:17 - when the Draw button gets clicked.
55:19 - And, by the way, I'm in text
mode, not in block mode,
55:21 - because we're getting
near the end of Code Break
55:24 - and we wanted to just teach
kids more advanced coding.
55:27 - So when the Draw button is clicked,
55:29 - here it uses the
OutdoorScene.grass command.
55:33 - The grass command came from
the library that Hannah wrote.
55:37 - And then to draw the
clovers, it uses a for loop,
55:41 - which is a repeat counting from zero
55:43 - up to the number of input1.
55:47 - GetNummber of input1 tells us the value
55:50 - of this little slider here.
55:52 - If you look here, it says id:input1,
55:54 - that tells us that that's input one.
55:56 - And then what it does is lifts up the pen,
55:59 - goes to a random location, and
points in a random direction,
56:03 - and calls the OutdoorScene.clover.
56:06 - So now what we wanna do, Darius,
56:07 - is to have you draw the
flowers and the butterflies,
56:09 - and you can copy the code up here.
56:11 - So what I would suggest is basically
56:13 - copying and pasting the
code to draw the clovers,
56:16 - and to change them to draw the flowers.
56:20 - So instead of counting
from zero to input1,
56:23 - how do you know how many flowers we have?
56:26 - - If input2, and I'm assuming
this is input3, yeah.
56:29 - - All right, so change that to input2,
56:32 - and then you have that code
56:33 - to move you to a random
direction and so on.
56:36 - And now instead of drawing a clover,
56:38 - take out the command that draws a clover,
56:41 - and instead add the command for flower.
56:47 - - There.
56:48 - - There you go.
56:50 - And now you can see for your flower,
56:51 - you need to add a size and a
color and a number of petals.
56:55 - So what size do you want
it to be for the flower?
56:58 - - Probably a random number
56:59 - because not all flowers
are of the same size.
57:02 - - Okay, so how big do
you wanna increase them?
57:04 - Two--
- Two, two, eight.
57:07 - - And now making them even bigger, maybe.
57:09 - - No.
57:09 - - Okay, and then what color
should we make for our flower?
57:14 - Why don't we have the
audience choose the color?
57:15 - Can we just put out a poll on the screen
57:17 - with some different color options?
57:19 - So orange, pink, gold
flowers, aqua flowers,
57:24 - I wonder what people are gonna choose.
57:28 - I would have thought that
people would choose gold
57:30 - as their favorite color,
57:32 - but there aren't that many gold flowers
57:33 - in the real world either.
57:35 - (Darius chuckles)
57:36 - All right, can we share the poll results?
57:41 - All right, the majority
want aqua flowers, right?
57:44 - So for our color there,
we need to type aqua.
57:51 - And Darius, can you explain why
57:52 - you put the little quotes for the aqua?
57:54 - - Because if you don't have the quotes,
57:57 - the computer sees aqua as a variable,
57:59 - which will mess everything up.
58:00 - - Yeah, it would think
that it's a variable.
58:02 - You wanna pass the value aqua,
58:04 - not the name of a variable called aqua.
58:06 - - Yeah.
58:07 - And then petals is how
many petals do you want?
58:09 - - Four.
58:10 - - Why don't you just put in
five, have all the flowers?
58:11 - - Random number.
58:12 - - Okay, you can have
different shapes and sizes.
58:15 - - I want some flowers
to have loss of petals,
58:17 - the integer is four to 12.
58:20 - - 12-petaled flowers.
58:22 - All right, so now let's
run the code for this
58:24 - and see how it works.
58:28 - - Run.
58:29 - - So add some clovers and flowers.
58:33 - - The butterfly is doing
nothing right now, so.
58:36 - - So it draws the grass,
it draws the clovers,
58:39 - and look at it, we drew
a whole bunch of flowers.
58:42 - So let's also, real quickly,
add the butterflies.
58:45 - But one thing I wanna point out is
58:46 - you know this code here
that we copied each time,
58:49 - moving the pen and so on, if
we copy this every single time,
58:53 - it's basically repeating
all of these same details
58:56 - over and over and over.
58:58 - Can you think of what we could do
59:00 - to not avoid repeating the same details
59:02 - and code using abstraction?
59:04 - - We could store it in a function like--
59:06 - - Yeah, we could put
that code in a function.
59:09 - So let's make a new
function for just that code.
59:13 - It's called myFunction, and
then take that code that,
59:16 - what do you wanna call it, son?
59:17 - - I'd like to call it moveRandom.
59:20 - - So it moves you to a random location?
59:22 - - Yeah.
- All right, so copy that code
59:24 - that moves you to a random location,
59:29 - and you're gonna hit Command C, Command V.
59:32 - All right, so this is our function,
59:34 - it moves us to a random location.
59:35 - So everywhere else where we did that,
59:37 - we don't need to do all
those three lines of code.
59:40 - Those same three lines of code
59:41 - everywhere else that we see them,
59:43 - we can instead just call your
one new function, moveRandom.
59:48 - So this is just like we were teaching you
59:50 - how the number one looks like this,
59:52 - or how the number two looks like this.
59:54 - If you maybe later wanna
say, "Show the number three,"
59:56 - you don't say, "Move up your hand
59:58 - "and stick out your thumb
and stick out your pinky,"
60:00 - you just say, "Show the number three."
60:02 - That's basically what we're doing here.
60:04 - Instead of having to repeatedly say,
60:06 - "Pen up, move to a random
this, move to a random that."
60:10 - So one thing I also wanna show is
60:12 - you can even hide this function.
60:13 - All these details, you
can click here to hide it
60:16 - and just not even worry about it.
60:18 - That code basically does what it does,
60:20 - and we're gonna use it from now on.
60:22 - So now let's add, finally,
60:23 - the code for writing the butterflies
60:25 - by copying the code for writing flowers,
60:28 - and we have just about maybe
20 seconds left to do this.
60:32 - So instead of getting
the number from input2,
60:36 - we'll get it from input3.
60:37 - - MoveRandom, and you
have to put butterflies.
60:41 - - Yeah, so bring out the
code for butterflies,
60:45 - and every butterfly has a size.
60:50 - Do you wanna pick a random size again?
60:52 - - Four to ten.
60:54 - There might be a bit--
60:54 - - You're right, and what color
should the butterflies be?
60:56 - Do you wanna make them
red or something else?
60:58 - - We should probably use
this thing I saw earlier.
61:01 - - Oh, there's a drop-down there, input4.
61:03 - Okay, so to do that, go under UI Controls.
61:08 - - Okay.
61:10 - And see where it says, getText,
pull that out, and put that.
61:15 - That will get the value.
61:17 - Instead of "id", put "input4" there.
61:22 - That'll get the value of that drop-down.
61:23 - So now you can run this app.
61:27 - - Oops.
61:29 - There.
61:30 - - And you can choose how
many clovers you want
61:32 - and how many flowers you want,
61:33 - and how many butterflies you want--
61:35 - - No, I don't want that many.
61:36 - - And then choose a color
for the butterflies.
61:38 - How about black or yellow?
61:40 - - Definitely not green.
61:44 - How about red?
61:45 - - All right.
61:48 - So now we have the grass
and then the clovers
61:51 - and then the flowers, and then
the butterflies in our scene.
61:55 - - What about the ants and ladybugs--
61:58 - - The ants and the ladybugs,
61:59 - we have a code for making those,
62:00 - but we wanna let
everybody else make those.
62:02 - - So we're leaving them out?
62:04 - - Yeah, we can add them later.
62:05 - And also, by the way,
there's these buttons here
62:07 - to hide these controls or to show them,
62:09 - I didn't walk through that as well,
62:11 - the code for those is over
here, and they were hidden
62:13 - so you don't need to bother
seeing those details.
62:15 - Those are also hidden in functions.
62:17 - But this, basically, is a very simple app
62:19 - that lets you make your own scene.
62:21 - Instead of sharing this out to
you right now via the phone,
62:24 - we wanna send it to you
62:26 - to have you create your
own addictions to this
62:28 - using the library that Hannah shared.
62:30 - So you can add the ants
and even the ladybugs.
62:33 - The ladybugs look really cool.
62:36 - And that's basically it in
terms of the app you wanna make.
62:39 - So what we want to do is
62:40 - if you haven't already
signed up for our emails,
62:43 - go to code.org/break,
62:45 - and we're gonna send you this
week's challenge assignment,
62:48 - and we'll do a bunch of things.
62:50 - First, you're gonna practice learning
62:51 - how to use functions in a
really fun Minecraft tutorial,
62:56 - and then as the challenge,
you can either use Sprite Lab,
63:00 - using functions, to make your own game
63:02 - just like Sofia was doing,
or you can use App Lab
63:06 - and take the library that
Hannah made with the ants
63:09 - and butterflies and so on to
make your own outdoor scene,
63:12 - or even to create your own
library to share that with us.
63:15 - And as always, if you
email us what you create,
63:18 - we'd like to invite you
onto the next episode.
63:20 - And I wanna say last week
63:21 - is our very last episode of Code Break.
63:23 - - Next week, you mean?
63:24 - - Sorry, next week. (chuckles)
63:26 - Next week is our very last
episode because school is ending,
63:30 - and for most of you, summer is starting.
63:32 - And we have a really
special jam-packed episode
63:34 - with three special guests.
63:36 - We're gonna be joined by
the inventor of Google Maps,
63:40 - the singer and songwriter, Aloe Blacc,
63:43 - and also, lastly, a product
manager for Microsoft Teams
63:46 - who also used to work on the Xbox.
63:49 - And so this should be
a really fun episode.
63:52 - Before we close, I wanna recognize, again,
63:54 - that we're at a really
historic time of unrest here,
63:58 - not just with the pandemic but
with the marches and protests
64:02 - that are happening here
in the United States.
64:04 - And I know all of you students are at home
64:06 - or going through a difficult time
64:07 - whether you're in the
United States or elsewhere.
64:10 - Our thoughts are with
you, and please stay safe,
64:12 - and please stay learning.
64:14 - It's the best way you
can change your future
64:16 - and help us make the world a better place.
64:19 - If you're studying alone,
64:20 - take a Code Break, and
we'll see you next week.
64:27 - Bye, everybody.
64:30 - (bouncy music)
