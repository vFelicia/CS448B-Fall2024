00:00 - The Hour of Code is kicking off Computer Science Education Week
00:03 - and I'm really, really pleased to be about to sit down with you guys and start coding.
00:09 - This campaign called the Hour of Code started exactly 3 years ago.
00:13 - Three years later every single country in the world has done an Hour of Code.
00:17 - We've passed 300 million Hours of Code
00:21 - And 20 billion lines of code written by students just like yourselves.
00:25 - This is going to be something that is as important as learning to read
00:30 - or learning to do math in the coming years.
00:32 - It helps us understand more of, like, how some people work
00:37 - and it's really cool and a fun experience.
00:40 - And what are you working on?
00:42 - Every job we're going to do in the future will rely on technology
00:46 - and be benefitted if you are powerful users of the technology that surrounds us.
00:52 - If I hit him he explodes.
00:54 - Very nice.
00:56 - This Hour of Code website... code.org. I'm going to get my kids to go on that.
01:01 - Oh actually we forgot something very important.
01:03 - Oh yeah, we gotta put in the ball.
01:05 - As we talk about all the different challenges we're facing
