00:07 - It's time to dig in to
some fun features of Sprite Lab.
00:10 - The first thing to do 
is to setup a Sprite.
00:13 - To add a Sprite, you can use
00:15 - the "make a new sprite" block.
00:19 - This block lets you give
00:20 - your Sprite a costume and a location.
00:24 - If you want to change 
the Sprite's location,
00:26 - you can click the pin
in the "location" block,
00:29 - and then click where you want it to go.
00:33 - You can change the size 
of your Sprites too.
00:36 - To make a Sprite smaller,
00:37 - you can use the "set size" block
00:39 - and then type in a number 
that is less than 100.
00:42 - If you have two or more Sprites
00:44 - with the same costume,
00:46 - this will change all of them at once.
00:49 - Now, let's get the sprite moving
00:51 - by using a behavior.
00:53 - You can start by giving the Sprite
00:55 - the "spinning right" behavior.
00:57 - Once a behavior begins,
00:59 - it will run over and over again forever,
01:02 - or until you tell it to stop.
01:05 - And that's all there is to it.
01:07 - Now it's your turn.
