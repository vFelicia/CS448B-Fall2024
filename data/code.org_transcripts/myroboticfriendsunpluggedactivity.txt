00:07 - This is a fantastic lesson
00:08 - called my robotic friends.
00:10 - It's a lot of fun.
00:11 - We teach programming
without using computers.
00:14 - So, we get groups together,
00:16 - where people program
their robotic friends
00:20 - to stack cups in 
a certain configuration
00:23 - just by drawing arrows
on paper.
00:29 - So right now, we are implementing
00:31 - the activity that they've been
working on.
00:33 - We had a programmer who
wrote down this program with arrows,
00:39 - and we have a robot who 
is reading the arrows
00:42 - trying to figure out what
they need to stack using the cups.
00:47 - So she'll translate the arrows
into specific movements
00:50 - to try and make one
of these stacks.
