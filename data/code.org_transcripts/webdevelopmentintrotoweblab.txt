00:05 - My name is Mei'lani. I'm a curriculum
development intern here at Code.org and
00:10 - I'm also a computer science student at
Cascadia College.
00:15 - I always liked the fact
00:17 - that I can make whatever I want with
computer science.
00:21 - I've been able to make really cool websites that are about topics and really passionate about.
00:26 - And I just really enjoyed that there's so many different ways to express myself through such an outlet.
00:33 - Websites are everywhere
and they're the primary way many people
00:37 - get their news, keep up with friend's
activities, learn new information and
00:41 - share the details of their lives.
00:44 - Right now, you might be a consumer of websites
00:46 - created by others, but you're about to
learn how to be a website creator with
00:51 - the power to make and share something
brand new with the entire world.
00:55 - To do this, you'll be using Web Lab, a unique tool
that allows you to create your own
00:59 - websites with many of the same
capabilities as a professional web developer.
01:04 - The instructions section
includes directions for the project
01:07 - you're currently working on. When you're
ready, you can collapse the instructions and shrink the size.
01:13 - Below the instructions, Web Lab has a list of files
01:17 - and images that will appear on the
website.
01:19 - Just like a news website has
01:21 - different pages for the front page, the
art and entertainment page and the
01:25 - science page, your website will
eventually have multiple pages based on files stored here.
01:31 - To edit a web page,
you'll need to navigate to the right file name that corresponds to that page.
01:38 - Every project starts with a single index
01:40 - dot HTML file which is the main page of
your website.
01:45 - When you click on the index.html file, it pulls up the contents of the file over here in the workspace.
01:50 - The workspace is where you develop your
website.
01:53 - You can start by typing anything in the workspace. Let's put a title at the top of our page, followed by a paragraph about our page.
02:00 - As you type, you
may see some of your changes appear automatically in the preview area.
02:06 - Some kinds of changes will not appear automatically. If your change doesn't
appear immediately it just click the
02:12 - refresh button about the preview area to
update the preview
02:16 - You'll notice that all the content on
your web page gets lumped together, which
02:21 - is not what we want, but stay tuned.
You'll soon learn ways to better control
02:25 - how your content appears
