Real Life Algorithms: Planting a Seed
00:05 - algorithm
00:07 - This lesson is called planting
00:09 - a seed, and it's going to help us understand
algorithms. Algorithms are specific instructions
00:14 - that explain the order in which to do something.
Even every day things like eating breakfast
00:19 - or brushing your teeth are algorithms that
require small steps to get a job done. Computers
00:25 - can be really smart, but they can only understand
you if you tell them exactly what you want,
00:30 - step by step. The great thing about algorithms
is that if you follow the instructions in
00:35 - order, you can do something that you didn't
know how to do ahead of time. It's like following
00:39 - a recipe. Today we're going to plant our own
seeds using an algorithm. So first we have
00:45 - to fill the pot with soil right? I don't think
we have to put glue on the seed. Right. Create
00:52 - your own algorithm by cutting apart the pictures.
Select the pictures that show steps in planting
00:58 - a seed, and then arrange those pictures in
the correct order. Now, it's time for you
01:03 - to see if your algorithm works. Follow the
steps in the algorithm very carefully. Are
01:09 - they in the correct order? Did you succeed
in planting a seed by following the algorithm?
01:14 - It's like programming with pictures!
01:19 - When we want to make chocolate, there are many
01:22 - big steps to that process. And each of those
big steps has its own set of smaller steps.
01:28 - And there are different recipes, or algorithms,
depending on how we want the chocolate to
01:32 - taste. Each step is important, even the small
ones. So without one step, the rest of them
01:36 - could not be completed. Creating algorithms
that others can understand is really important.
01:43 - That's why each step has to be written down
so that no matter who does it, the result
01:47 - is the same.
