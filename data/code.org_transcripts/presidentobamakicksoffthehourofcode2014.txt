00:00 - Hi everybody!
00:01 - Last year, students and teachers across our
country celebrated Computer Science Education
00:06 - Week with an Hour of Code.
00:08 - They learned new skills, programmed games
and apps, and realized that while no one is
00:13 - born a computer scientist, becoming a computer
scientist isn't as scary as it sounds.
00:19 - With hard work, and a little math and science,
anyone can do it.
00:22 - For this year's Computer Science Education
Week, more than 48 million people have already
00:27 - participated, and we're hoping even more of
you will get involved.
00:31 - Don't just consume things, create things.
00:33 - Take an hour to learn more about the technology
that touches every part of our lives.
00:38 - That's how you can prepare yourself with the
skills you need for your future.
00:41 - And that's how you can help prepare our country
for the future as well.
00:46 - America has always been a nation of tinkerers,
builders, and inventors.
00:50 - We brought the world everything from the lightbulb
and the telephone, to the iPad and the Internet.
00:55 - So whether you're a young man trying his hand
at programming for the first time or a young
00:59 - woman who is already hard at work on the next
big thing, we're counting on you--America's
01:03 - young people, to keep us on the cutting edge.
01:06 - Thanks everybody, and happy coding!
