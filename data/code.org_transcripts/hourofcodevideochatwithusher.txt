00:02 - hello everyone and thank you for joining
00:04 - us today for a special hour of code
00:06 - video chat to celebrate Computer Science
00:09 - Education Week today we have Asher
00:11 - Raymond joining our question and answer
00:12 - session today
00:14 - Asher is a singer and songwriter who is
00:16 - passionate about leveling the playing
00:17 - field and giving you access to computer
00:20 - science education everyone let's take a
00:22 - minute to welcome Usher I hope you guys
00:56 - are all doing great today I see your
01:00 - posters and I appreciate you very much
01:03 - and I appreciate your attention and
01:06 - understanding me of the importance of
01:10 - this our code well we're gonna start
01:17 - with the first question
01:19 - unfortunately central city junior high
01:21 - school from Central City Iowa is having
01:23 - technical difficulties
01:24 - so I'm going to be asking the question
01:26 - for them uh sure how do you think
01:29 - programming has affected the world we
01:32 - live in
01:41 - you
01:42 - you
01:45 - with Myron with as advances modern
01:49 - technology is we still have some growth
02:04 - you
02:15 - uh nowadays it's about the opportunity
02:20 - the experience being brought directly to
02:22 - you nomads and also to the expansion of
02:25 - you understanding this world that is
02:27 - constantly evolving and connecting each
02:32 - and every day through computers through
02:34 - this social connection
02:40 - programming is going to become so
02:42 - significant in the future that we won't
02:46 - be able to do anything without a
02:47 - computer you know to have a job you'll
02:50 - have to not only understand how to
02:52 - navigate and understand
03:02 - you
03:21 - so we're having a bit of technical
03:23 - difficulty we're going to get in touch
03:26 - with Usher side and see if we can make
03:28 - the video a little bit more clear I'm
03:30 - we're gonna double check in a few
03:32 - minutes and we're going to continue with
03:34 - the next question
03:34 - just give us a couple of minutes to
03:36 - troubleshoot
03:51 - there's some technical difficulties
03:53 - that's causing us to not be connected so
03:55 - I'm gonna log out and log right back in
03:57 - you guys I'll be right back
04:02 - you
04:07 - and on the screamin went away
04:10 - yeah but we didn't you
04:18 - okay we're back can you guys see me yes
04:23 - okay cool sure the question was what do
04:33 - I think how do I think programming has
04:36 - affected the world that we live in well
04:38 - the way we communicate now is basically
04:42 - through the programming this
04:44 - communication this ability to have
04:46 - social media have us connected from all
04:48 - around the world and as we continue to
04:50 - grow you know it is this connection our
04:55 - computers our programming that will
04:56 - allow us not only to communicate but
04:59 - also understand each other in the future
05:03 - there will not be a world of of analog
05:08 - anymore everything is becoming all
05:11 - computer music the way music is created
05:15 - the way businesses are operated the way
05:19 - people communicate in terms of their
05:21 - businesses their jobs their identities
05:23 - all that that's the world will that's
05:26 - them that's the future how is computer
05:40 - science used in the music industry
05:43 - computer science is used in many
05:47 - different ways I mean we waited from a
05:51 - time when not before I actually started
05:55 - singing where everything was compute
05:57 - what everything was manually created
05:59 - through guitars there were some computer
06:02 - generation there was a smaller general
06:05 - earlier generation of computers there
06:08 - but for the most part now music is
06:11 - created in the studio on a laptop even
06:13 - though you're performing using
06:16 - instruments it goes into a computer and
06:18 - then reprocess is the way they eacute
06:21 - equalize turning upset bass or either
06:24 - treble the way we communicate in terms
06:29 - of get
06:30 - music out to the world being able to
06:33 - discover artists being able to see and
06:35 - make the connection to an artist through
06:38 - seeing what they visually have put
06:40 - together and what they've been able to
06:41 - do through code through introducing
06:45 - visuals videos music the musical
06:50 - experiences live experiences all of
06:53 - those things are now connected to
06:56 - computer science in that way DJs don't
07:00 - deejay without a laptop producers don't
07:03 - produce without a laptop Hey welcome to
07:08 - our third question from Asher Collier
07:11 - Elementary in Atlanta Georgia I love you
07:23 - guys - how do you think computer coding
07:34 - will impact the way music is produced in
07:38 - the future well as I said I don't know
07:43 - if you guys heard me um my last answer
07:46 - but now producers don't create without a
07:52 - laptop they don't come they don't
07:55 - produce without a computer the
07:58 - connection to the way they introduce the
08:01 - music the way it's surfaced that on for
08:05 - instance you know sites like YouTube you
08:08 - guys familiar with YouTube you're
08:10 - familiar with Spotify all of these
08:12 - sources are now how music is distributed
08:16 - where you know earlier on before you
08:20 - went to a record store or a CD store or
08:23 - a music store you guys had to go to like
08:26 - a record store and get a record then it
08:27 - became a tape then it became a CD now
08:30 - it's a file and that file goes directly
08:33 - into your computer and now you don't
08:35 - even have to have a file anymore a zip
08:37 - drive or anything I think you just
08:38 - simply go online and you can purchase
08:40 - music right there from
08:43 - from the tap of a button and most likely
08:47 - not even purchase it now I mean so the
08:49 - distribution meaning the way that music
08:52 - is now given back and forth between
08:53 - people from the artists to the to the
08:56 - fan is through this connection and
09:00 - computer science and also to computer
09:02 - coding the creation of our videos the
09:05 - creation of how we are recognized as
09:08 - artists all will be created through code
09:10 - when you guys go to my website
09:12 - everything that you see there in terms
09:14 - of the information that I have to offer
09:16 - you whether you're buying a ticket to a
09:17 - concert or you you're getting
09:20 - information about where I'm gonna be
09:21 - what took place what photos were taken
09:23 - when I was there my communication
09:25 - between you know what you wrote and what
09:28 - I had to say in response all done
09:29 - through coding all done through computer
09:31 - coding
09:38 - thank you we're gonna go to the next
09:40 - question and from Memorial Middle School
09:43 - in Spotswood New Jersey oh my god I I
09:50 - love you
09:56 - what is your opinion of what is your
10:03 - opinion about people using technology to
10:06 - illegally download music and how do you
10:08 - feel about platforms that offer
10:09 - unlimited access to music like Spotify
10:12 - well first of all I want to send a shout
10:14 - out to the man in the back of the room
10:16 - with this camera filming want to put you
10:19 - on the spot all right well you know
10:25 - downloading music was inevitable it was
10:28 - something that was going to happen
10:30 - regardless because people want the
10:33 - connection you know and then there still
10:35 - are people who care about the creation
10:38 - or the creative problem process for the
10:42 - artist the art work that goes into it
10:44 - all of those things are for people who
10:46 - really do care about understanding the
10:48 - artist and what they are attempting to
10:51 - convey through their music so there will
10:52 - still be people who'll go to this tool
10:54 - to you know
10:57 - Amazon in order but to look at it now
11:01 - you're making the connection to Amazon
11:02 - to even get the actual form of a
11:05 - tangible copy of a CD or a record if
11:08 - there's anyone that still produces a
11:11 - physical copy of a record um but it was
11:14 - inevitable that sites like Spotify or
11:17 - Napster earlier which was one of the
11:19 - first ones to make the connection where
11:22 - people will be able to download music
11:23 - and in time it will become free because
11:26 - people would naturally then re-upload it
11:29 - you know I think that now people have to
11:33 - be a lot more savvy and now it's gonna
11:35 - be more important to understanding
11:37 - understand coding especially if you want
11:39 - to have some sense of individuality
11:41 - because you don't have a tangible copy
11:42 - anymore so now you have to have a
11:45 - knowledge and understanding right of how
11:47 - to create through coding what your
11:51 - creative intern
11:52 - rotation of your album was so that
11:54 - people can now have it otherwise they're
11:56 - gonna get the music for free they're
11:57 - gonna like the songs that they like they
11:59 - may buy an entire album or they might
12:01 - not but at least you are able to make
12:03 - the connection to your fans to hopefully
12:06 - lead to live performances and being able
12:09 - to make the connection there but you
12:12 - know that's that's my opinion I don't I
12:13 - don't I don't have any issue with any
12:16 - illegal downloading I don't like it I
12:19 - would hope I hope that you guys would go
12:21 - and support me and buy my albums did you
12:23 - buy my album last time you came out
12:28 - No oh wow well hopefully next year when
12:34 - I put out my next time you guys will
12:36 - purchase it and you won't illegally
12:37 - download it but I hope that you like it
12:39 - regardless thank you I'm going to Garcia
12:45 - Young Men's Leadership Academy in Austin
12:47 - Texas gentlemen I am music is talented
13:03 - and you're very talented you just want
13:05 - to know how do you feel about audience
13:06 - I'll tune for the muta stuff you can
13:13 - this is a silent answer no um I'm not
13:19 - too happy um
13:21 - the abuse of auto-tune but you know when
13:24 - it's used as a tool to heighten what
13:30 - your experience is in through the music
13:34 - right it's okay but for people who don't
13:37 - go through the process I'm nurturing
13:39 - your voice this is a god-given talent
13:41 - right so I had to work at it really
13:43 - really hard but when it's used as a tool
13:44 - to perfect your voice without you doing
13:48 - the work I mean in the long run
13:50 - eventually people are gonna know that
13:52 - you're not a real singer and that you
13:54 - can't really hold it together in front
13:57 - of an audience which is a which is what
13:58 - this is ultimately about it's a
14:00 - connection between the artist and the
14:03 - audience and being able to interpret
14:07 - emotion filling and convey passion
14:10 - through song and melody the disconnect
14:15 - is auto-tuned at times because you may
14:18 - you lose some of the texture you don't
14:20 - get all of the emotion because it's kind
14:23 - of muffled together for perfection and
14:25 - those little bitty things that are being
14:27 - taken out in my opinion are the things
14:30 - that make who we are as art is so unique
14:33 - so you know I don't have an issue with
14:37 - it as I said but I do feel like it
14:39 - disconnects people from
14:41 - the emotional connection and the actual
14:44 - skill of being a great singer thank you
14:48 - we'll move on to our next question from
14:51 - Southwest middle school in Gastonia
14:54 - North Carolina if you could create an
15:07 - application to make your life easier
15:18 - okay
15:22 - if I could create an application to make
15:24 - my life easier what would it be and why
15:27 - is that what you asked
15:30 - is that your question yes okay have you
15:35 - seen the movie heard okay you should see
15:39 - it it's pretty cool I would actually um
15:42 - create an app that would be like her and
15:47 - you know she would make my life super
15:49 - easy organize all of my computers
15:52 - organize my life through my computer and
15:56 - help me manage my day-to-day also to be
16:01 - a cool companion to talk to thank you
16:06 - now we're gonna go to Columbus middle
16:09 - school from Columbus my question for you
16:32 - is what inspired you going to music and
16:35 - what I fight you are aspiring for don't
16:40 - use autotune um well hmm what inspired
16:52 - me to go into music is my love and
16:54 - passion for it what advice do I have for
16:58 - aspiring singers you have to work at
17:02 - this as time is leading us more and more
17:07 - towards code and computer science being
17:12 - more relevant than anything we cannot
17:14 - lose the sense of individuality and get
17:18 - lost so while it's great to have tools
17:20 - like Toto I like Pro Tools and it's
17:23 - great to have auto-tune and all those
17:25 - things you should still have to remember
17:26 - that the most important part is the
17:29 - asset that is you so your ability to
17:31 - listen to the music and physically sing
17:33 - it and sound great or either feel good
17:35 - is important you know as the standard is
17:40 - changing of how we communicate and how
17:42 - we
17:43 - offer what we have to what we have is
17:46 - artists you have to continue to nurture
17:49 - the true talent that means you got to
17:51 - work at whatever you want to do you know
17:53 - I think that being physical is important
17:55 - understanding how to distribute it how
17:57 - to connect how to continue to live your
17:59 - life and make sure that you're not
18:02 - behind that's the importance of the this
18:04 - hour of code but as an artist you cannot
18:07 - lose the true sense of art of the art of
18:11 - making music in the art of performing
18:15 - that's the most those are the two most
18:18 - significant things that were taught to
18:19 - me when I first started when there were
18:21 - when there were no computers and the
18:24 - thing that I think every person who is
18:28 - aspiring to be an artist needs to
18:29 - understand that should be a priority
18:33 - you're welcome finally our last question
18:38 - from Milton Elementary School in Milton
18:41 - Delaware well one to be passionate about
19:04 - whatever you invest your time in because
19:07 - anything that you are successful that
19:11 - you're gonna have to work at okay the
19:13 - other side is making sure that you
19:17 - understand the importance of computer
19:19 - coding and also to
19:22 - to live in a world where computers are
19:25 - going to be relevant and we're gonna
19:28 - need them for everything so if you don't
19:30 - understand the importance of the net
19:32 - you'll be behind you may not be able to
19:35 - have a job you may not be able to take
19:37 - care of yourself you may not be able to
19:38 - communicate you may lose your connection
19:41 - and not be able to find out what's going
19:46 - on in the world without this device
19:48 - without understanding the importance
19:50 - this one component that right there I
19:55 - think is what is essential for you to
19:57 - learn and also to what is essential for
20:00 - you to to be a great student and also to
20:02 - make sure that greater than that you
20:04 - grow up to be an incredible parent an
20:07 - incredible adult and understand how to
20:11 - communicate and that's that's it well
20:17 - thank you that wraps up our questions so
20:19 - thank you guys for joining us today and
20:21 - spending time answering them yeah so
20:23 - much for the students nope but everyone
20:32 - let's to join me in the round of
20:33 - applause thinking usher for his time
20:35 - joining us today to support
