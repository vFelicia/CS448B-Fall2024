00:02 - [Music]
00:05 - we're about to model the session where
00:06 - you collect teacher barriers and sort
00:09 - them out so we can come up with supports
00:11 - as a group what you're going to see is
00:13 - the process of collecting the post-its
00:15 - processing them and deciding where
00:17 - throughout the sessions today we're
00:19 - going to address those questions
00:22 - okay so at this point we've been
00:24 - collecting post-it notes from the
00:25 - teachers and i've gotten started
00:27 - organizing them
00:29 - right now that organization is really
00:31 - just clustered into the topics of
00:33 - questions that we offered up to teachers
00:35 - at the start of this activity so the
00:38 - topics you're going to see here are the
00:39 - code.org values
00:41 - teaching
00:42 - practice course material website and
00:46 - other that's sort of the catch-all for
00:48 - anything else that doesn't fit so these
00:50 - are the types of questions we solicited
00:52 - and now what we're going to do is
00:54 - determine which of these questions we
00:57 - can address right now in this uh
01:00 - barriers activity and which of these
01:02 - questions are going to naturally be
01:04 - addressed later on in the workshop i'm
01:06 - going to take you through and show you
01:08 - how i would sort these post-its and talk
01:10 - a little bit about why i'm putting
01:12 - things where i'm putting them
01:14 - [Music]
01:20 - so we're going to get started here in
01:21 - our values questions these are questions
01:24 - that i put into the values category when
01:26 - i picked them up from teachers they
01:28 - didn't necessarily tell me they belong
01:29 - here uh but these are related to our
01:32 - values in the classroom so we've got
01:34 - questions here about including more
01:36 - girls in computer science we've got a
01:39 - cluster of questions from a couple of
01:40 - people about how to support students who
01:44 - are coming in with different levels of
01:45 - content knowledge and then we have a
01:47 - question about the role of the teacher
01:49 - and uh plugged or unplugged lessons
01:52 - which is better
01:53 - so to navigate this i'm going to start
01:57 - by prioritizing the the place where i
01:59 - have multiple people asking about the
02:01 - same thing so i've got three people
02:03 - asking about content knowledge so i'm
02:05 - gonna circle that
02:08 - and i'm going to say that this is a
02:09 - topic we need to talk about as a group
02:12 - and i know that we don't have another
02:14 - place to do this later in the workshop
02:16 - so i think this might be a good thing to
02:18 - prioritize in our upcoming jigsaw
02:21 - activity so i'm going to say
02:24 - different
02:27 - content
02:32 - knowledge
02:35 - so these are my things related to
02:37 - different content knowledge
02:39 - i'm gonna ignore the rest of these for
02:41 - right now i can come back to them in a
02:42 - minute but uh including more girls in
02:45 - the class and the role of the teacher
02:47 - and unplugged or plugged lessons neither
02:49 - of those really have to do with
02:50 - different content knowledge so we're
02:52 - going to see if these might fit into a
02:53 - different theme that emerges as we keep
02:55 - going
02:56 - if we move on to teaching practice we
02:59 - have a bunch of different questions here
03:02 - i've got a question here about using
03:03 - unplugged lessons when students are all
03:05 - in different places in the course
03:07 - a question about keeping english
03:09 - language learner students in the same
03:11 - place as other students
03:13 - how to integrate with other content
03:15 - areas
03:16 - how to help students when they get stuck
03:19 - and someone saying hey i don't really
03:21 - know enough computer science content how
03:22 - can i help my students so these are all
03:25 - related to the theme of teaching
03:27 - practice and we're going to take a
03:28 - minute to look here and see how we can
03:31 - combine different uh questions that are
03:34 - related to one another and therefore
03:36 - could be addressed in our jigsaw
03:38 - so the first thing that i'm noticing
03:40 - when i look at this is that a question
03:42 - about unplugged lessons
03:44 - maybe isn't actually about teaching
03:46 - practice this could be about tools in
03:48 - our website so i'm actually going to
03:50 - take this post-it and make the executive
03:53 - decision as the facilitator but even
03:55 - though this was listed before as
03:57 - teaching practice this is really a
03:59 - question about keeping kids in the same
04:01 - place in the course and the best way to
04:03 - do that is by better understanding how
04:05 - the website works so i'm going to move
04:06 - this over to the website category
04:11 - and come back to it when i get when i
04:13 - get to that
04:15 - now i'm back in my teaching practice
04:17 - section i've got four post-its here and
04:19 - i need to make a decision about which of
04:22 - these i might want to address here in
04:25 - this barriers section session and which
04:28 - might be addressed naturally later on in
04:30 - the day
04:31 - so for example i am pretty confident
04:34 - that a conversation about integrating uh
04:37 - with other content matter this can come
04:40 - out in our lesson planning time that's a
04:42 - big focus of lesson planning and i know
04:44 - that because i'm familiar with the
04:46 - workshop agenda so i'm going to put this
04:49 - down here
04:50 - below the squiggly line
04:52 - and i'm just going to make a note to
04:54 - myself that that should come out in
04:56 - lesson planning
04:58 - i have another question here about
04:59 - helping my students when they get stuck
05:01 - that sounds to me a lot like debugging
05:04 - and i know that we have a whole session
05:06 - later in the workshop about debugging so
05:09 - i'm going to move that down here
05:12 - and i'm going to just make a note
05:16 - that it will be addressed during
05:17 - debugging
05:19 - that's leaving me with two different
05:22 - post-its left here about teaching
05:23 - practice one about supporting english
05:25 - language learner students and one about
05:29 - addressing a lack of cs content
05:31 - knowledge
05:32 - i think that we could open up this
05:35 - category we made over here about
05:37 - different content knowledge and say this
05:40 - is about different content knowledge
05:42 - coming in plus diverse learning needs
05:44 - because those are really related and i
05:46 - can move this over
05:48 - so
05:50 - i'm going to say learning needs
05:56 - plus different content knowledge and
05:58 - this is one bucket
06:02 - now i have a topic left here in teaching
06:04 - practice about how to navigate teaching
06:06 - the course when you still don't have a
06:08 - lot of content knowledge i'm going to
06:09 - leave that on its own for right now and
06:11 - see if we have more post-its down the
06:12 - line that might contribute to this and
06:14 - come back to it later as a reminder at
06:17 - this point we're really just trying to
06:18 - come up with our four different areas
06:21 - that each group is going to explore for
06:23 - our lesson jigsaw that comes up later
06:26 - let's move on to course materials for
06:28 - now
06:30 - so we've got four questions here about
06:32 - course materials lots of them are about
06:34 - where stuff lives so we've got a
06:36 - question here
06:38 - are there lesson plans i've been using
06:40 - the 2017 curriculum guide that sounds
06:42 - like someone who needs to better
06:43 - understand our resources and i happen to
06:46 - know because i'm familiar with the
06:47 - workshop that there's a session later on
06:50 - a scavenger hunt where people are going
06:52 - to have room to actually dig in and see
06:55 - where all of these materials live so i'm
06:57 - going to move that below the line
06:58 - because i know it will happen later and
07:00 - i'm going to label it scavenger hunt
07:05 - question here i'm struggling with a
07:07 - lesson in course c please advise well
07:09 - that's something that definitely can
07:11 - come out in lesson planning so i'm going
07:13 - to move that below the line as well
07:15 - because lesson planning is a time to get
07:16 - into some lessons that would be a great
07:18 - thing to do there so i'm going to label
07:20 - that as lesson planning means we don't
07:22 - have to do it during
07:24 - this activity right now but we can still
07:26 - get answers
07:28 - question here about standards that csf
07:30 - maps to or standards that csf uh covers
07:34 - that's another thing that we can find in
07:36 - the scavenger hunt so i'm going to add
07:38 - that down here
07:39 - and then a last question that's left is
07:41 - that i started my kids on the express
07:43 - course a month ago but they're already
07:45 - bored
07:46 - well that's something that we could
07:48 - address in a lot of different ways and
07:49 - maybe we want to talk about this
07:51 - directly during our our upcoming
07:54 - activity about barriers because this
07:55 - sounds like a pretty uh a pretty loaded
07:58 - or
07:59 - deep uh problem that they're
08:01 - encountering this isn't something that's
08:02 - just surface level it's something that
08:03 - we could really dig into and talk a lot
08:05 - about so i'm gonna leave that there as a
08:07 - potential topic for our jigsaw activity
08:11 - and move on to to decide what we want to
08:13 - do with it
08:15 - takes us to our next category which is
08:16 - website
08:18 - typically most things in the website are
08:20 - going to be covered later in the session
08:23 - and that's because we have we have these
08:25 - sessions in the workshop specifically
08:27 - focused on understanding how materials
08:29 - are organized and how you use them
08:31 - so
08:32 - to get started with this
08:34 - we've got a question here that says what
08:36 - types of student logins should i use
08:38 - with my second graders that's a perfect
08:40 - thing to uncover in the scavenger hunt
08:42 - so i'm going to put that below the line
08:44 - and say that you'll get answers to that
08:46 - in the scavenger hunt
08:48 - there's a question about keeping
08:49 - students in the same spot i think that's
08:52 - really related to the question before
08:54 - about how to use unplugged lessons when
08:56 - students are all over the place in the
08:58 - course so i'm going to cluster those
08:59 - together
09:01 - there's a question here about tracking
09:03 - students who are pair programming later
09:06 - on in the model lesson we're actually
09:07 - going to use the pair programming tool
09:09 - so teachers will get to see this so i'm
09:11 - going to put that below the line
09:15 - and label it that it will be addressed
09:17 - in the model lesson
09:18 - and then using the website is confusing
09:20 - how do i easily navigate code.org well
09:23 - this is a big focus of the scavenger
09:25 - hunt is answering questions about how to
09:27 - navigate the website so i know that
09:29 - that's going to be addressed down here
09:32 - so that leaves just these two items
09:35 - about that are relatively short in how
09:37 - they're written but they're about pretty
09:39 - deep questions which is how do i
09:40 - actually like teach the class so
09:43 - students stay in the same place this is
09:45 - a really common question that comes out
09:47 - and it comes out in a lot of different
09:48 - ways but that's the underlying question
09:50 - is what pedagogy can i use to keep
09:52 - people together so meaningful
09:54 - instruction can happen so i'm going to
09:56 - circle these and keep them together
09:59 - and i'm going to say
10:02 - that this is about the role of the
10:04 - teacher
10:08 - plus keeping students together
10:19 - all right this takes us to our final
10:21 - category the catch-all category called
10:23 - other
10:24 - when we get to the other category we are
10:26 - going to look back at everything we've
10:28 - done up to now to see if any of these
10:30 - things slot in nicely with what we've
10:32 - already uh with what we've already
10:34 - clustered together
10:35 - and if they don't we'll start making
10:37 - some new categories as a reminder we're
10:39 - trying to come up with four sort of
10:42 - circled buckets that we're going to
10:43 - address in this upcoming jigsaw activity
10:46 - and so far we've identified two so we're
10:48 - really looking for two more
10:51 - to get started i've already clustered
10:54 - these three together because i saw them
10:57 - while i was collecting the post-its from
10:59 - teachers these questions are all about
11:02 - helping people understand the value of
11:04 - computer science getting buy-in with a
11:08 - special focus on administrators so
11:11 - this seems like a common question that
11:13 - we're really going to want to figure out
11:14 - how to address
11:16 - and i'm also seeing
11:18 - some other questions that weren't
11:20 - originally put with this that feel like
11:21 - they might be a good fit so as an
11:23 - example this question says my great band
11:26 - team doesn't like that i'm doing
11:28 - something different but parents are
11:29 - really excited how do i get other
11:31 - teachers on board this is really about
11:34 - buy-in right so we're going to put that
11:35 - up with the question about administrator
11:37 - buy-in and that's going to be one of our
11:39 - groups
11:41 - so i'm going to go ahead and circle this
11:44 - because i know that's going to be
11:45 - important you can't teach a class if you
11:47 - don't have buy-in from the other people
11:48 - in your school so that's definitely one
11:51 - of our categories and we're going to
11:53 - call it buy-in
11:56 - beyond that i'm seeing some questions
11:59 - here about time all three of these
12:02 - post-its are meeting time for class uh
12:05 - other subject areas taking all of your
12:08 - time so
12:09 - i'm going to put these together and say
12:12 - that we have a bucket here about time
12:19 - and actually
12:20 - i also see a post-it here that says we
12:22 - only have one computer lab and i can't
12:24 - get it scheduled regularly
12:27 - this is kind of related to time this is
12:29 - about time and access so i am going to
12:32 - expand this category to be time
12:36 - plus access
12:38 - and put these together
12:41 - so if we zoom out now and look across
12:44 - all of our buckets
12:46 - we should have things living in circles
12:48 - or things that are below the line
12:51 - we shouldn't have these one-off post-its
12:54 - and when we do have one-off post-its
12:56 - left we need to find either places where
12:59 - they should live
13:00 - or we need to identify that these are
13:02 - things that need to go onto the question
13:04 - parking lot and we need to give time to
13:06 - at the very end of the day so we're
13:08 - going to do that pass right now i see a
13:10 - total of three post-it notes that don't
13:13 - have a home just yet i'm going to grab
13:16 - them and i'm going to figure out where
13:18 - these fit into things
13:20 - so
13:21 - getting support outside of the workshop
13:23 - this is really like a question of
13:24 - community i think and when i scan the
13:27 - themes that i have so far i'm not seeing
13:30 - community as a big one here yet so i'm
13:32 - gonna put this down in other
13:35 - and i'm going to say parking lot
13:39 - and parking lot doesn't mean we're not
13:40 - going to do it it means we're going to
13:41 - do it during the dedicated time in the
13:43 - workshop to clear the parking lot
13:47 - questions about student engagement i
13:49 - think this is sort of related to the
13:51 - role of the teacher so i'm going to
13:53 - cluster that together
13:55 - and then there's a question about cs
13:57 - content and helping students i'm going
14:00 - to also throw this down into the parking
14:02 - lot because that's something where i
14:03 - think there are lots of resources that
14:05 - other teachers in the room might have
14:07 - ideas about
14:09 - so at this point we have processed all
14:11 - of our post-it notes we have identified
14:13 - the four categories of of questions that
14:16 - we'll use during our lesson jigsaw and
14:18 - we're ready to move into that
14:21 - so we've just gone through how you
14:23 - collect and sort the post-it notes in
14:25 - order to inform our jigsaw activity that
14:27 - comes next
14:29 - this is the time where we're really
14:30 - deciding how to address the questions
14:32 - that teachers came into the workshop
14:34 - with and we're figuring out the best way
14:36 - to get them the answers that they need
14:39 - [Music]
14:46 - you
