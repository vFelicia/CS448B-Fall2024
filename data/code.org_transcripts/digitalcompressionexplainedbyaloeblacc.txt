00:01 - [Avicii- 'Wake Me Up']
00:05 - My name is Aloe Blacc.
00:06 - I'm a signer and a songwriter 
and entertainer.
00:10 - [Avicii- 'Wake Me Up']
00:14 - When it became more and more important
00:17 - for artists to have
a presence on the internet,
00:19 - I quickly developed the skill 
to build a website,
00:24 - and get online,
00:26 - and use my knowledge of coding
00:28 - to make it so that people 
could learn more about our music.
00:35 - Every bit of data or information
can be stored digitally.
00:39 - Whether it's numbers, text, 
pictures, music, or video,
00:42 - all of it can be represented digitally.
00:44 - That means the information can be 
represented by electrical signals
00:47 - that are on or off,
00:49 - or as ones and zeros, so to speak.
00:52 - But representing information in ones 
and zeros can take up a lot of space.
00:56 - For example, if you wanted to store 
a three minute song digitally,
01:00 - it would take up over 
30 megabytes of space.
01:03 - A one hour HD video
would take 800 gigabytes.
01:06 - In the real world, digital information 
is compressed, to take up less space.
01:11 - A 30 megabyte song can be compressed 
down to 3 megabytes.
01:15 - An hour long video can be compressed
from 800 gigabytes
01:18 - down to just 1 gigabyte.
01:21 - Sometimes compression is lossy,
01:23 - which means that to save some space,
some of the information is thrown away.
01:28 - For example, an image can be compressed
01:30 - to a lower resolution to lose some detail.
01:33 - Lossy compression is useful because
in many cases the human eye or ear
01:37 - can't even notice the details that 
are being lost.
01:41 - When you compress data without losing
any details,
01:43 - that's called lossless compression.
01:45 - This means the compressed data 
can be decompressed
01:48 - back into the exact original.
01:51 - One way of doing lossless compression 
is to find patterns
01:53 - in the data you're trying to compress.
01:56 - As an extreme example,
01:58 - imagine a book about dogs with
hundreds of pages using only one word.
02:02 - Each page just says dog.
Dog, dog, dog, dog,
02:06 - over and over a million times.
02:09 - Instead of writing it all out
you could just store the pattern,
02:11 - dog times 1,000,000.
02:13 - Now that's a silly example,
02:15 - but let's look at a more real example.
02:18 - Instead of a book, imagine
the lyrics of a song.
02:21 - If a single words or phrase is
repeated a lot, you can store that once
02:26 - and then reuse it without
repeating the data.
02:29 - The repetition in a song lyric 
or poem is obvious,
02:33 - but really any form of information
can have repetition or patterns in it.
02:37 - They're just not as obvious.
02:39 - For example, an outdoors photo 
can have a blue sky,
02:42 - and instead of storing 
every single blue pixel,
02:45 - that can be compressed.
02:46 - With the amount 
of information that's digitized
02:49 - and sent around the internet every day,
02:51 - there are much fancier ways 
to compress the data.
02:53 - Data compression is now built into how 
every picture or song, or movie, is stored,
02:58 - and almost every webpage 
you visit is compressed
03:00 - as it's sent to your device.
03:02 - All these compression algorithms 
have one thing in common.
03:05 - They all aim to represent the information 
in the smallest format possible,
03:09 - in a way that can be decompressed
to reconstruct the original,
03:13 - or at least something close to it.
