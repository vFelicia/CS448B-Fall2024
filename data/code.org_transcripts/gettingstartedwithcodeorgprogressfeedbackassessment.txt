01:54 - working on this level and click the
01:56 - Finish button to submit a solid green
02:00 - dot with a check mark means that the
02:02 - level has validation tests and the
02:04 - students code has passed all of them
02:07 - most levels have just one activity but
02:09 - Choice levels signified by a forked
02:11 - Arrow allow students to choose at least
02:14 - one task from multiple options in this
02:17 - example the student has chosen to submit
02:19 - the First Choice level but not the rest
02:23 - this is what choice levels look like for
02:25 - students they will always have access to
02:27 - every option in the choice level but you
02:30 - can instruct them to complete as many or
02:32 - as few as you'd like the system
02:35 - automatically evaluates many levels in
02:37 - our elementary school and apcsa
02:39 - curricula for correctness a solid Green
02:42 - Dot with a check mark means the student
02:44 - submitted the correct
02:46 - solution however programming levels in
02:48 - our CS discoveries and CS principles
02:50 - curricula have many possible solutions
02:53 - and will not be automatically validated
02:55 - for these curricula we recommend
02:57 - choosing one or two activities per
03:00 - lesson to
