00:00 - (President Barack Obama) Hello everybody! How you doing?
00:03 - [Raw Video: Hour of
Code at the White House, December 8 2014]
00:06 - Good to see you, what's your name? Nice to see you.
00:09 - I just want to say to everybody, Code.org
is doing some incredible work and I'm so proud
00:16 - of the young people who are here today who
came down from New Jersey on a big field trip.
00:23 - All across the country, people are doing code.
We're starting too late, when it comes to
00:28 - making sure that our young people are familiar
not just with how to play a video game, but
00:32 - how to create a video game. (student) Right
here it tells you that you have to move forward.
00:37 - (Obama) Okay you gotta slow down, because
I'm an old man. So what's going on?
00:44 - Because of Code.org, because of collaboration with
schools, and because of these outstanding students
00:49 - somebody in this room I suspect
is going to come up with an outstanding new
00:55 - game or new device or something that I won't
be able to figure out but Malia and Sasha
00:58 - will be able to teach me how to use it. (Vice
President Joe Biden) Girls can do anything!
01:03 - Anything, anything, anything! Don't let anybody
tell you you can't. (Obama) Don't give up.
01:07 - And don't just say, "Well, I'm not good at
it. I'm just not going to do it." You gotta
01:11 - make sure that you stay with it, and that's
what teachers are there for. Alright? I'm proud of you guys.
01:17 - Special thanks to: President Obama and all of the White House staff.
