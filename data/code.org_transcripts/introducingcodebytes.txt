00:00 - Hi, I'm Hadi Partovi, founder of Code.org
and the Hour of Code.
00:04 - This is my daughter, Sofia.
00:06 - Hi everybody!
00:08 - This year, Code.org is doing something very
special for Computer Science Education Week.
00:12 - Because so many schools are closed, and teachers
aren't sure how to host an Hour of Code, we're
00:17 - going to help.
00:18 - My team and I will host 5 days of live interactive
short lessons, where students can join in
00:24 - and learn to code along with us.
00:26 - You'll get a chance to program your own Dance
Party, with music from your favorite artists.
00:31 - We'll show you how to program your own outbreak
simulator, to visualize how a virus spreads.
00:37 - Then we'll dig into the world of Minecraft
and solve unique puzzles.
00:41 - Because computer science has potential to
change the world for the better, we'll explore
00:45 - the basics of app design, and how to make
your own app for good.
00:50 - Finally, we'll take a look at how to train
a computer AI to recognize sign language images
00:55 - in real time.
00:56 - No matter where you are or who you are, computer
science can come straight to you.
01:01 - It's fun and easy and a great way to be creative.
01:04 - Join us and we'll be learning together every
day from December 7th through 11th.
01:09 - See you soon!
