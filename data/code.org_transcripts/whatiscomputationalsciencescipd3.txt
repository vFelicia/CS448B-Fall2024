00:06 - hi and welcome everyone my name is
00:07 - maureen saladombrowski and i work with
00:09 - project guts in santa fe new mexico
00:12 - in this video we're going to explore
00:14 - computational science a new type of
00:16 - science made possible by computers and
00:18 - the impact it's having on our everyday
00:20 - lives
00:21 - computational science can be seen as the
00:23 - third leg of science in addition to
00:25 - theoretical and experimental science
00:28 - it lies at the intersection of computer
00:30 - science mathematics and science
00:33 - computational science uses mathematics
00:35 - and computer science to model real-world
00:37 - problems and conduct simulation
00:39 - experiments
00:41 - computational science is made possible
00:43 - by the advent of powerful computers
00:46 - increases in computational power have
00:48 - enabled us to design and conduct
00:49 - experiments on models of systems that
00:51 - are too big too expensive or too
00:53 - dangerous to experiment with in the real
00:55 - world increased computational power
00:57 - allows us to run multiple what-if
00:59 - scenarios very quickly
01:01 - we also collect and analyze large
01:03 - amounts of data produced by these models
01:05 - but it is important to note that
01:07 - computational science does not replace
01:09 - traditional field
01:10 - experimentation each approach is
01:12 - appropriate in different situations
01:16 - computational science opens up new
01:18 - opportunities for problem solving and
01:20 - empowering students as scientists
01:22 - we use the computational science cycle
01:24 - to describe the process used by
01:26 - computational scientists
01:28 - we start by selecting a real world
01:31 - problem or phenomenon we're interested
01:32 - in studying
01:34 - then we need to make a simplified
01:35 - version of the real world doing so
01:38 - produces an abstraction for a model
01:41 - next we go from the abstract idea for a
01:43 - model to a computational model by
01:45 - representing the components and
01:46 - behaviors in terms of formal mathematics
01:49 - and algorithms
01:52 - the next step is to translate the
01:53 - algorithms into a computer code
01:56 - these four steps are called computer
01:58 - modeling
02:00 - finally we run simulations using the
02:02 - computer model we created as an
02:04 - experimental testbed
02:06 - simulations run time forward as if we
02:08 - could speed up time to see how the
02:10 - future unfolds
02:12 - during the simulation we can produce and
02:14 - capture data from these data we draw
02:16 - conclusions and interpret if our model
02:18 - has any basis in reality
02:20 - if the model reproduces some features of
02:22 - reality that we care about as compared
02:24 - to the real world data perhaps it can be
02:26 - used to help us understand or make
02:28 - predictions about the real world
02:32 - scientists and researchers use computer
02:34 - models to study a wide variety of
02:35 - phenomenon
02:36 - let's hear from melanie moses melanie is
02:39 - a computer scientist and biologist she
02:41 - uses computer simulations of ant
02:43 - colonies to study and design computer
02:45 - networks
02:47 - a professor in the department of
02:48 - computer science here at unm and i also
02:51 - have an appointment in the department of
02:53 - biology
02:54 - and i'm going to tell you about some
02:56 - research that we've been doing in my lab
02:58 - over the last couple of years
03:00 - using agent-based models very much like
03:02 - the kinds of agent-based models that you
03:03 - all are learning to build
03:06 - and we've used those models to study
03:09 - complex systems
03:10 - and
03:12 - the systems we focus on are ant colonies
03:14 - and computer systems and we learn a lot
03:18 - about
03:19 - each system by studying the other so in
03:21 - our models foragers are searching for
03:23 - food on a grid
03:26 - and upon finding this food they decide
03:27 - whether or not to return to where they
03:29 - went use inside fidelity or to
03:31 - communicate using pheromones
03:33 - and we used a technique called genetic
03:35 - algorithms to evolve the parameters of
03:37 - the model so these
03:39 - in other words are many different ways
03:40 - that the ants could behave many
03:42 - different ways they could move many
03:43 - different ways they could balance memory
03:46 - and communication and our goal was to
03:48 - find the way that maximized the rate
03:51 - that seeds were collected in a fixed
03:52 - period of time
03:54 - so we learned a great deal about what we
03:56 - think the ants in the field are doing
03:57 - and what good strategies for foraging
04:00 - collectively are so we then wanted to
04:02 - take those strategies and do something
04:03 - with them this was going to be sort of
04:04 - our final test about whether the
04:06 - strategies really worked and so what we
04:08 - did is we took those strategies and we
04:10 - programmed them
04:11 - we use them as the programs that govern
04:14 - swarms of robots so we built these
04:16 - robots in our labs these are robots
04:19 - controlled by iphones there's an iphone
04:21 - up here and a pretty simple motor and a
04:23 - few sensors
04:24 - and these robots then we send them out
04:27 - collectively we have a group of six of
04:29 - them and we send them out to forage
04:31 - using the behaviors that the ants have
04:32 - told us are good foraging behaviors what
04:35 - i told you about is um
04:37 - you know kind of my belief that these
04:39 - computational and biological systems are
04:42 - both these kind of complex systems where
04:44 - you have interacting agents that are
04:46 - hooked together by networks of
04:47 - communication
04:48 - and
04:50 - we can use computer science we can use
04:52 - models to reveal how biology
04:54 - biological complex systems work
04:57 - and on the other hand we can go to
04:59 - biology and we can ask how do
05:03 - distributed strategies work in
05:04 - particular these ants
05:06 - taught us that
05:08 - you can have a scalable distributed
05:10 - search mechanism by balancing individual
05:12 - memory uh with pheromone communication
05:15 - and we were able to take that and put
05:17 - that into swarm robotics so this is a
05:18 - case where we have
05:20 - mobile computers moving around
05:21 - interacting with each other that can now
05:23 - imitate the way that ants
05:25 - communicate with each other to achieve
05:26 - some task
05:28 - and i think this sort of approach
05:30 - um is important because as computer
05:32 - science
05:32 - as computers become more and more
05:35 - internetworked their interactions with
05:37 - humans with each other with the physical
05:39 - world all um introduce this new layer of
05:41 - complexity
05:42 - and i think that biology has evolved
05:45 - many interesting solutions to these
05:46 - these sorts of complex
05:49 - challenges and so i'm hopeful that we
05:52 - actually will learn a great deal more
05:53 - about how to build computer systems by
05:55 - studying biological systems
05:58 - stephen guerin is a computational
05:59 - scientist who uses modeling and
06:01 - simulation to address public safety
06:03 - issues such as emergency evacuation
06:05 - planning
06:08 - hi my name is steven guerin i'm working
06:10 - here in santa fe at a company called
06:12 - redfish and another one called sim table
06:14 - where we're an applied complexity
06:16 - company which is where we're taking
06:18 - ideas coming out of places like santa fe
06:20 - institute unm los alamos and sandia
06:23 - looking at complex systems and finding
06:26 - applications to them in the real world
06:28 - some of the tools that we're using are
06:30 - things like agent-based modeling which
06:31 - you're learning in
06:33 - tools like netlogo machine learning
06:35 - machine vision
06:37 - statistics and probability are kind of
06:39 - you come together into
06:41 - ways that people can come around a
06:43 - physical interactive table to look at
06:45 - emergency management issues like how
06:47 - will a fire spread how will fluid move
06:50 - down in a dam break how what's the
06:53 - social side of an evacuation who's going
06:55 - to shelter in place who might evacuate
06:57 - and also the traffic dynamics
06:59 - arising from these instances so instead
07:02 - of traditionally presenting our results
07:04 - up on a screen
07:06 - or on a wall
07:07 - either on the laptop or on the wall
07:09 - we're taking the same projector and
07:11 - projecting it down onto surfaces or
07:13 - around the room and then making those
07:15 - surfaces interactive by watching that
07:17 - same surface with a camera so this
07:20 - has nice challenges of how do you how do
07:22 - you detect where a laser pointer is
07:24 - clicking on a very non-uniform surface
07:26 - and map that up to a projector or how do
07:28 - i detect where somebody's hand is or
07:30 - their their body is so these are all
07:32 - nice problems in machine vision
07:34 - at the core of i think computer science
07:35 - today and many applications
07:38 - in addition with simulation
07:40 - big data and analytics as well as
07:43 - machine learning
07:44 - so what we have here
07:46 - up on the top maybe out of frame as we
07:49 - pan over here is we have a projector
07:51 - that is just an off-the-shelf projector
07:53 - projecting on a table we have a web
07:55 - camera and a mac mini bolted on the back
07:57 - and that's the full extent of the
07:59 - computation that's going on and we're
08:00 - projecting that down onto a table here
08:04 - and
08:05 - we'll turn off the lights here so you
08:06 - can get a better view of it
08:09 - and
08:10 - basically you're seeing the camera
08:12 - taking a picture of this
08:14 - table and reflecting these white uh
08:16 - borders back so i don't know
08:18 - if you can see my hands in here or the
08:19 - laser pointer and in the beginning you
08:21 - can see there's a little bit uh well
08:23 - first of all the camera is upside down
08:26 - flipped and it's a wide angle so the
08:29 - image is a little bowed so the first
08:30 - algorithm we're going to do
08:32 - is we're going to take
08:34 - the projector space and convert the x
08:37 - and y of the projectors into a binary
08:39 - code
08:40 - and there's a particular kind of binary
08:42 - code called gray code
08:44 - that we're going to now come through and
08:46 - project that great code of all the
08:48 - position coordinates and let the camera
08:50 - take a photo
08:51 - and it's learning for every pixel in the
08:53 - camera it's positioned in camera space
08:57 - and then converting that to a projector
08:59 - space
09:00 - so once the the camera registers that
09:03 - we're able to bring up gis information
09:06 - right now the table is flat
09:08 - and we're projecting
09:10 - the area of santa fe here for instance
09:12 - and we also have the ability to use my
09:15 - laser pointer and make the surface
09:18 - interactive
09:19 - the first thing i'm going to do is i'm
09:21 - going to put it into 3d scan mode
09:23 - and i'm going to make some arbitrary
09:25 - hills
09:26 - so imagine a firefighter wanted to train
09:28 - on how fire behaves when it's going
09:30 - through a valley or through a saddle
09:32 - point
09:33 - and
09:34 - so we make uh we have the ability now to
09:37 - project some lines on the table and this
09:39 - is a sinusoidal grayscale pattern and
09:42 - based on how the stripes move and the
09:44 - displacement of the camera from the
09:45 - projector there's enough information to
09:47 - recover the height of the sand so that
09:50 - scanning process
09:52 - lets us now use that as a real
09:54 - information in a fire
09:56 - the other way we like to use this is
09:59 - loading a known topography like in santa
10:01 - fe
10:02 - and let me turn off all these different
10:03 - layers for you first
10:06 - and we start off with the colors of the
10:07 - rainbow
10:08 - and we can also click on any one
10:11 - location in here and fly to that
10:13 - position in google earth so now we're
10:14 - registered in gis space
10:16 - so what i'm going to do now with the
10:18 - colors of the rainbow
10:19 - is i'm going to move the sand
10:21 - from the low points kind of the red
10:23 - points
10:24 - and using the colors of the rainbow roy
10:26 - g biv red orange yellow green blue
10:29 - indigo and violet we're going to make
10:31 - the terrain of santa fe
10:33 - and i'll
10:34 - take my trusty
10:36 - piece of wood here
10:37 - and get the bulk of the sand to the east
10:39 - in santa fe in the east mountains
10:42 - this is north on the table
10:44 - i'm just going to bring the sand in here
10:46 - roughly
10:47 - and then we'll do a little finer detail
10:49 - with the hands
10:51 - so this is um
10:53 - so right now we're forming the ski basin
10:56 - here's the santa fe uh watershed coming
10:58 - down here with the
11:00 - the mcclure nichols reservoir cerro
11:02 - gordo
11:04 - this is hyde park coming through here up
11:06 - to the ski basin
11:08 - and this is thompson peak in the east
11:11 - and so part of this is we call tangible
11:13 - computing
11:14 - uh and it lets people kind of interact
11:17 - with a real surface and and actually
11:19 - form the surface and get a little bit of
11:21 - muscle memory as people learn in
11:23 - different ways some people can just look
11:24 - at a contour map like an expert but some
11:27 - people
11:29 - learn contours in a different way in
11:31 - elevation and being able to form it with
11:33 - their hands
11:34 - has some advantage
11:36 - so this is a roughly santa fe
11:39 - with the mountains in the east
11:41 - and now we can layer on different pieces
11:42 - of information
11:44 - here we're going to show
11:47 - i'll turn on hill shading so if you
11:49 - think of a a raster or bitmap with
11:51 - elevations
11:53 - we can look at every point on that patch
11:55 - like for your net logo and look at its
11:57 - eight neighbors and figure out what
11:59 - direction that patch is uh facing we
12:02 - call that aspect and gis and then we can
12:04 - color that or shade it based on where
12:06 - the sun is so here i'll move the sun to
12:08 - the east or the west
12:11 - and we can put a little bit more detail
12:13 - on here
12:14 - the elevation data was coming from the
12:16 - usgs at a 10 meter resolution
12:19 - per pixel
12:21 - we can now lay around things like the
12:22 - roads as a polyline
12:26 - or as a structures which are points so
12:28 - these are the houses
12:30 - and we can also come in and inspect
12:32 - certain areas
12:33 - so i can say well what is the fuel or
12:35 - vegetation type in any one of these
12:37 - pixels so it's it's like i'm inspecting
12:39 - a patch and it's a patch variable and
12:41 - that ultimately we're going to have a
12:43 - fire model on here that wants to move
12:45 - uphill
12:46 - downwind it'll be a function of the fuel
12:48 - type as well as the strength and
12:50 - direction of the wind which is a single
12:52 - vector here with the strength and
12:54 - direction of the wind indicated
12:56 - so once we have this in here
12:58 - while i was inspecting the patch layer
13:00 - and we're showing elevation but i can
13:01 - actually show the fuels layer also so
13:04 - here's
13:05 - your ponderosa pine pinion juniper and
13:07 - grass and chemisa and so once we have
13:09 - this loaded i've got all the features
13:11 - necessary to light a fire and having a
13:14 - biased cellular automata model of how
13:16 - fire spreads so let's put this guy into
13:18 - fire mode
13:20 - and we can start up a fire maybe down uh
13:23 - near uh
13:25 - this kind of upper canyon and cerro
13:27 - gordo kind of intersecting here and if
13:29 - you can see it's maybe easier to see on
13:31 - the terrain view here
13:34 - so we have a fire spread now that's
13:36 - a function of the direction of the wind
13:38 - and the slope and i can speed up time
13:43 - and we'll watch that thing spread or we
13:44 - can also simulate what if there was
13:46 - spotting behavior up on the hills as the
13:48 - wind is pushing it
13:49 - and we can also think about the human
13:51 - response of
13:53 - where would i put maybe an air tanker
13:56 - to slow down the head of the fire the
13:59 - direction in which it's going which is a
14:01 - very dangerous place to put human
14:02 - resources so we want to use our airplane
14:04 - to slow down the fire there
14:06 - and we maybe put our humans uh with a
14:09 - hand crew
14:10 - at the heel or the base of the fire away
14:13 - from you know downhill
14:15 - and down wind or upwind of the fire
14:18 - excuse me
14:20 - and these guys will have a certain
14:21 - production rate
14:23 - be easier to see if i turn off the roads
14:25 - here
14:26 - and so these guys are making their line
14:29 - in a certain rate
14:30 - we can also then introduce things like a
14:32 - bulldozer team who might be a resource
14:34 - of arriving later
14:37 - as the fire gets more progressed but you
14:38 - can you know compare compare their
14:40 - progression rates to the hand crews
14:43 - over time so they're able to dig a lot
14:45 - more line to contain this fire
14:48 - so this is the physical aspect of a fire
14:51 - we can also turn on the roads and the
14:53 - structures and for every house
14:55 - we can simulate an evacuee or one in
14:58 - this case one and a half evacuees per
15:00 - house
15:01 - and start to look at where we'd expect
15:03 - congestion to be so now we can have the
15:05 - fire service interacting with
15:08 - public safety or the police who are
15:10 - going to be in charge of the evacuation
15:12 - typically these guys train separately on
15:14 - their part of the problem this lets them
15:16 - come together around a common problem
15:18 - and deal with those issues so this is a
15:20 - first instance of using agent-based
15:22 - modeling in the real world
15:24 - kind of a new form of human computer
15:25 - interaction that takes advantage of
15:27 - machine learning simulation
15:30 - and um in a lot of statistics so
15:33 - think of this as new ways of
15:35 - of solving problems this is sim table
15:45 - as we've seen computational science is a
15:47 - new branch of science that integrates
15:49 - computational thinking and computing
15:50 - into the sciences
15:52 - scientists are using computer modeling
15:54 - and simulation to understand predict and
15:55 - prevent the daunting problems we face
15:57 - such as climate change loss of
15:59 - biodiversity energy consumption and
16:02 - epidemics
16:09 - you
