00:04 - In this version of the widget, we've made
setting the metadata of the image a bit easier.
00:10 - For the width and height, you can type the
decimal numbers that you want.
00:13 - Use the sliders, or type the binary as you
did before.
00:18 - It's useful to be able to change these things
quickly to see the effect on the image.
00:23 - Notice when you change the data by typing
or using sliders,
00:27 - the binary data changes and the image canvas
reflects the changes.
00:32 - There's a another piece of metadata here called
"Bits per pixel",
00:35 - which will allow us to make more than purely
black and white images as we did before.
00:40 - To see what it does, let's set "Bits per pixel"
to one,
00:44 - which is what we had for black and white images
before,
00:47 - and let's paste in a familiar black and white
image.
00:50 - In order for an image to have a range of colors,
00:52 - it seems logical that we will need several
or many bits to represent the color of each
00:57 - pixel.
00:59 - The "Bits per pixel" setting in the metadata
tells the widget how many bits it should use
01:03 - to calculate the color of a pixel.
01:06 - You can see if I change the "Bits per pixel"
setting, the widget will interpret the bits
01:10 - differently,
01:11 - and you'll see some colors start to appear.
01:14 - Of course, the binary data for this image
was written for a black and white image, with
01:18 - one bit per pixel,
01:20 - but if we change how that data is interpreted
by increasing the bits per pixel that the
01:24 - widget is expecting to see, the image gets
garbled.
01:28 - Let's start over and try to get the hang of
using color in digital images.
01:33 - I'm going to make a very small image so that
we can really look at what's happening with
01:37 - the pixels.
01:38 - So I'm going to set the width to four and
the height to two.
01:43 - Now, let's look at how RBG colors work with
this tool.
01:47 - As you know for color images, each pixel is
actually a combination of red, green, and
01:52 - blue light.
01:54 - If we want to represent this is binary, the
least we can do is allocate three bits for
01:58 - each pixel,
02:00 - one bit each for the red, green, and blue
values.
02:04 - I can use the slider to set the number of
bits per pixel I want to use to render the
02:08 - image.
02:09 - So I'm going to set the bits per pixel to
three.
02:13 - So now, with three bits per pixel set, I can
control the amount of red, green, and blue
02:18 - light that goes into each pixel.
02:21 - As before, if I turn all the lights off, I'll
get the color black, and if I turn all the
02:27 - lights on, I get white.
02:30 - Since I have one bit of control for each of
the red, green, or blue lights, I can turn
02:35 - them on or off individually.
02:38 - So if I want a red pixel, I can turn on the
red light and turn the green and blue lights
02:43 - off.
02:44 - So that's red on, green off, and blue off.
02:46 - One, zero, zero, and, presto, I get a red
pixel.
02:51 - Now, you keep going and create a green and
a blue pixel.
02:55 - Notice that when we have three bits per pixel,
02:58 - the first bit controls the red light, the
second controls the green light, and the third
03:03 - controls the blue light: R-G-B.
03:08 - Now it gets interesting.
03:09 - What happens if we mix the lights?
03:12 - Let's see what happens if we turn on the red
light and blue light, and leave the green
03:16 - light off on the same pixel.
03:19 - Before I type it, make a mental prediction:
03:22 - What color do you think we'll get if we mix
red and blue?
03:25 - Think about it for a second.
03:26 - All right, ready?
03:28 - Here we go.
03:30 - Red on , green off, blue on.
03:33 - It made pink!
03:35 - Is that what you were predicting?
03:37 - I'm guessing that you thought we might get
purple.
03:39 - Well, this is one of the key differences between
mixing light and mixing paint.
03:45 - It's actually the opposite physical process.
03:48 - When you mix a lot of paint together, the
color gets darker and darker.
03:52 - When you mix light together, the color gets
brighter and brighter.
03:57 - It can take some getting used to, but you'll
get the hang of it.
04:01 - With only three bits, we know that I can only
combine them eight different ways,
04:06 - so with three bits, only eight colors are
possible.
04:09 - Now you keep going and finish the remaining
two colors.
