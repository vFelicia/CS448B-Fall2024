00:07 - Aren't bees super cool?
00:08 - In this next set of puzzles, your goal is
to help the bee get to the flowers and get
00:13 - nectar from the flowers and fly over to the
honeycomb to make honey.
00:18 - You'll need to use the "get nectar" and the
"make honey" blocks for this exercise.
00:23 - Every flower has a different number of nectars:
1, 2, 3, or more.
00:27 - We know how much nectar is in the red flowers,
by the little number in the corner.
00:31 - So be sure to get all the nectar from the
flower before you move forward.
00:35 - Also, every honeycomb can only hold so much
honey: 1, 2, 3, or more.
00:41 - So be sure to make as much honey as the honeycomb
can hold.
00:44 - If you're able to get all the nectar and make
all the honey, you succeed and go to the next
00:48 - level.
00:49 - Otherwise, you need to try this puzzle again.
00:52 - Play around a while and see what it feels
like to "bee" a programmer!
