00:00 - Can you imagine if you had to repeat something
forever and ever?
00:05 - Hopefully you never have to because computers
are really good at repeating things. This
00:10 - is the repeat forever block. Anything inside
this block will happen forever in the game.
00:15 - If we want an actor to do something repeatedly
without the player having to do anything,
00:21 - we'll put those blocks inside the repeat forever
block. In this next puzzle, our goal is to
00:27 - help the actor do a job continuously. Learning
how the repeat commands work will save you
00:33 - a ton of time later when you build your own
game.
