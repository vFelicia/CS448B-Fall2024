00:07 - Most apps keep track of pieces of information that change and update as you use the app.
00:12 - For example a simple game can keep track of your score and the number of lines you have right as you play.
00:18 - Apps utilize the computer's memory to do this and learning how to use that memory when programming is a really powerful skill.
00:26 - The most common way to leverage a computer's memory is by creating a variable.
00:31 - Now a variable is just a container for storing a value.
00:35 - And once created the variable is stored in the computer's memory
00:39 - and it can be used and updated repeatedly throughout your program.
00:44 - As an example,
00:46 - let's use variables to keep track of the score and the number of lives remaining in a hypothetical game
00:52 - Creating the variable is really easy you use the word var followed by a label that you want to give the variable you can choose
01:00 - Any label you want, but it helps to choose a word that describes the variable that you want to store
01:06 - So let's label our first variable score to keep track of the score
01:10 - And then we can create a second variable to keep track of lives
01:15 - Remember these labels, you'll need them later in order to use the variables
01:21 - We can assign a value to the variable using the equal sign like this?
01:27 - Let's set our starting score to zero and our number of lives to three?
01:31 - Remember you only need to use the var at the time that you want to create a new variable a common mistake is to use?
01:37 - It every single time you want to refer to a variable also be sure to avoid mixing up the order when you call your variables?
01:45 - The labels got to appear on the left and the value has to appear on the right like this.
01:51 - not like this.
01:54 - Often you'll want to create a variable and assign it a value right away.
01:57 - There's there's a really convenient way to do this with one line of code.
02:01 - This is sometimes called.
02:02 - initializing the variable.
02:04 - It's important to realize that this single line of code is actually doing two things.
02:09 - First creating the variable and then second assigning it a value.
02:14 - Let's take a moment to talk about the equal sign. In many coding language the equal symbol is called the assignment operator.
02:22 - Because you use it to assign of value to a variable, and you're probably used to seeing it in math.
02:27 - But in programming it's a little bit different if you were in math class and you saw this.
02:33 - Something would definitely be wrong score.
02:36 - Can't possibly equal both 5 and 7 but this is not math class.
02:41 - with code a computer is executing a set of instructions one after the other so.
02:46 - This would just tell the computer to set score to 5 and then on the next line set it to 7.
02:53 - In an effort to avoid confusion, programmers often don't use the word equals when we see the sign.
02:59 - Instead, they use the phrase 'gets the value', so when we see a statement like this.
03:04 - We could read it as score gets the value 7 or score gets 7 for short.
03:10 - Some programming languages in void the confusion entirely by representing the assignment statements with a sideways arrow like this.
03:19 - To use a variable you just refer to it by its label.
03:23 - Anywhere the variable name appears in the program the value currently stored in the variable will be retrieved from memory.
03:30 - The tricky part is that when using a variable you often can't see visually what its value is.
03:37 - To bypass that problem you can use console.log to display the value like this.
03:45 - This is a really handy trick.
03:47 - But remember there's a difference between showing the value of a variable and writing out the variables label.
03:53 - When text appears in quotes you're telling the computer to write those literal ASCII characters on the screen like this.
04:03 - But on the other hand without quotes the computer assumes that you're referring to a variable called score.
04:08 - And it will attempt to retrieve its value if you haven't made that variable then the computer will give an error
