00:09 - the preparation for this one is pretty
00:11 - long because you actually have to go
00:13 - through and explain to the children how
00:16 - it's different to have something come
00:18 - out from a computer's point of view
00:20 - versus their point of view so it's
00:22 - definitely helpful if they understand
00:24 - how dice race works but if they don't
00:26 - you can use something like a magic 8
00:28 - ball or yahtzee or something else that
00:30 - they played talk about how it looks from
00:32 - their point of view and then talk about
00:34 - how it looks for a computer to present
00:36 - that to them
00:41 - we've been talking about algorithms and
00:44 - we've been talking about how you can
00:45 - make a list of steps to explain a task
00:49 - and in the past we've been talking about
00:51 - how we can
00:53 - make instructions to describe things
00:55 - that we do every day but we're going to
00:57 - change it up a little bit you guys are
00:59 - getting older and it's time to start
01:01 - thinking about
01:02 - how you can describe tasks from the
01:05 - other side so instead of describing what
01:08 - we see when we play a game
01:11 - then we can start describing what the
01:13 - computer
01:15 - needs to show us
01:17 - and i'm going to show you how it's
01:18 - different are you ready
01:19 - okay
01:20 - so i'm going to give you two
01:22 - each a dice and we're going to have a
01:24 - dice race
01:25 - okay
01:27 - so
01:29 - you'll be number one
01:31 - and you'll be number two
01:33 - and we are going to move forward a
01:35 - certain amount based on what you roll
01:38 - we're gonna have three rolls and whoever
01:40 - gets the farthest at the end of those
01:42 - three rolls wins all right
01:44 - so let's go roll number one
01:48 - they win the glory of being the farthest
01:51 - in the dice race game i'm okay with that
01:53 - okay go
01:55 - four okay go
02:00 - five
02:01 - whoa
02:05 - okay
02:06 - roll number two okay you go first
02:12 - three
02:15 - three
02:20 - and final roll roll number three
02:24 - two
02:27 - six
02:28 - whoa
02:34 - okay
02:36 - so you see in the dice race game
02:38 - number one was the winner
02:42 - so now you know how to play the dice
02:44 - race game
02:45 - yeah
02:46 - now i need us to think of our list of
02:49 - steps
02:50 - that it takes to play that game because
02:52 - understanding how to play is one thing
02:55 - but being able to explain it step by
02:57 - step to someone else is another thing
03:00 - right
03:01 - so if we're going to play the dice race
03:03 - game what's the first thing we need to
03:05 - do
03:07 - make sure that there's a player one a
03:08 - player two okay
03:10 - so you have player one and player two
03:15 - and
03:16 - what's the score at the beginning
03:20 - yeah
03:20 - zero zero zero zero so each of them your
03:24 - score is zero
03:26 - so then what do you do
03:29 - yeah you will um the die
03:32 - once and then you get however many
03:35 - points so then you roll the dice
03:39 - and then
03:42 - you add
03:44 - that to your score
03:49 - and then what happens
03:52 - you do that
03:53 - three more times
03:55 - okay
03:57 - so
03:58 - you do this three times
04:00 - so
04:02 - does one person do all things three
04:04 - times
04:07 - all three times
04:09 - okay
04:10 - so
04:11 - player one does this
04:15 - and then
04:18 - player 2 does this
04:28 - and we do all that
04:31 - three times
04:33 - and then what happens
04:35 - whoever has the highest score at the end
04:38 - wins
04:39 - okay
04:40 - highest scorer wins
04:49 - does that sound about right
04:51 - okay
04:52 - so this
04:54 - would be the instructions
04:56 - if we are teaching someone else how to
04:58 - play
05:00 - right
05:01 - what do you suppose would be the
05:02 - instructions if we wanted a computer
05:06 - to help pretend like we were playing on
05:08 - the computer so what things would be
05:11 - different how would we
05:14 - how would we describe that
05:17 - okay
05:19 - so yeah what's the first thing we would
05:21 - need to do
05:27 - so you would need to initialize your two
05:30 - players so you need to have two players
05:32 - and again you would have probably a
05:36 - variable called player1
05:39 - and you would set that equal to zero
05:42 - right
05:43 - and you have a variable called player2
05:45 - and you set that to zero because that
05:48 - would be their score
05:50 - okay and now you're the computer
05:52 - now if you're a person you're rolling
05:55 - for your first turn
05:57 - if you're a computer
05:59 - is the computer gonna go oh let me roll
06:02 - the dice
06:03 - no so you're gonna have to program it to
06:06 - do something
06:07 - because you don't want it to give you
06:09 - the same number every time right so what
06:11 - number would we be showing
06:13 - something between
06:14 - 1 and 6. okay
06:18 - number between 1 and six and how do you
06:20 - suppose we choose that number have you
06:22 - guys
06:23 - ever heard of a term called random
06:25 - numbers
06:27 - yeah so you could also just have it
06:29 - choose what
06:32 - a random number
06:39 - okay
06:40 - so the first step if you're the computer
06:42 - is to set the scores to zero
06:44 - the next thing we'll do
06:46 - is we will have it choose a number
06:49 - from one to six at random
06:51 - because that's going to be the role for
06:53 - that first player right
06:55 - and after it's rolled
06:57 - what does the computer need to do
07:03 - um
07:04 - tell the number and then
07:06 - whatever that number is add it to the
07:08 - player's score bar
07:10 - right so it's going to choose the number
07:13 - and it's going to show it
07:15 - here
07:18 - and then here it's going to take
07:20 - player one score right which is
07:24 - p1
07:26 - and it's gonna it's gonna say
07:28 - the new score
07:31 - is whatever the old score was plus
07:35 - whatever this one was right we'll call
07:37 - it
07:40 - we'll call it roll and we'll put the one
07:42 - to show that it's player one
07:44 - right
07:45 - so we'll have the old score plus roll
07:48 - and that'll become the new score
07:51 - all right so now what do we do it's now
07:54 - the second player's turn
07:57 - now what do we do
08:00 - once it added it up
08:03 - okay
08:04 - so once we've got player ones
08:06 - now we have to do this again for
08:09 - player two
08:10 - player two so we'll choose another
08:14 - random number
08:24 - okay so we've rolled again for player
08:26 - two now what do we do
08:29 - um then you have the computer add the
08:32 - score to player two's score from zero to
08:36 - whatever
08:37 - they cleared two got randomly assigned
08:46 - okay
08:47 - and then
08:49 - repeat three so we have to repeat this
08:52 - whatever number of times we've decided
08:54 - that we're going to play in our program
08:56 - before we determine a winner and after
08:59 - we're done repeating that then what
09:00 - happens
09:03 - yes
09:04 - the player with the highest
09:07 - okay now how does the computer figure it
09:10 - out
09:12 - oh yeah whichever number is highest so
09:15 - you have to figure out which number is
09:16 - highest right
09:18 - so in this case
09:20 - uh subtract
09:23 - p1 oops
09:25 - you're saying subtract p1
09:28 - minus p2
09:30 - and if it's a negative number
09:34 - that means that this was bigger and p2
09:38 - wins
09:38 - so if it's negative p2 wins
09:41 - if it's positive then this one was
09:43 - bigger
09:44 - so player one wins
09:47 - and if it's equal to zero
09:49 - then what happened
09:50 - um
09:52 - then it's a tie
09:59 - okay so what we're going to do now is
10:01 - i'm going to give you a real life dice
10:03 - race game to play
10:05 - you guys are gonna play the game
10:07 - together
10:10 - and when you're done playing the game
10:14 - you're gonna write the algorithm down
10:15 - for it
