00:01 - foreign
00:04 - Davis and I'm an aerospace engineer at
00:07 - NASA
00:10 - what's NASA
00:13 - and liftoff
00:15 - NASA is a space agency that is looking
00:20 - to help the world better understand

00:26 - planets
00:27 - [Music]
00:30 - what do you do at NASA
00:32 - I use computers every day
00:35 - I program spacecrafts to look at
00:40 - specific points on a planet to get back
00:42 - science data
00:44 - [Music]
00:46 - what do the spacecrafts do
00:51 - various missions that we have they have
00:54 - different objectives whether it's
00:56 - increasing the knowledge on the weather
00:58 - to things like increasing knowledge
01:00 - about asteroids
01:04 - when did you learn about computer
01:06 - science
01:09 - I knew about computers growing up we had
01:11 - you know computer class but I wasn't
01:13 - that into computers and maybe it was
01:16 - because I thought that wasn't like the
01:18 - cool thing to do but it wasn't until
01:19 - later that I started to understand what
01:22 - possibilities come with computers and
01:25 - then I started saying this is actually
01:27 - kind of fun after I took a class in
01:29 - programming now it's something that I do
01:31 - almost on a daily basis something that I
01:33 - thought I couldn't do I'm doing every
01:35 - day and it's a lot of fun what is the
01:38 - coolest thing about your job
01:41 - the single coolest thing to me about
01:44 - working at Nasa is the fact that I can
01:46 - look into the sky at night and think
01:50 - about all the spacecrafts that I've
01:52 - worked on that are currently orbiting
01:55 - the Earth or orbiting an asteroid is
01:58 - really rewarding and so that's really
02:00 - cool to me
