00:00 - Which grade are you in?
second, tenth grade, first grade
00:10 - I was in the eight grade when I learned to program.
00:12 - I got my first computer when I was in the sixth grade.
00:16 - What gets me excited is
being able to fix peoples problems.
00:20 - You can express yourself;
you can build things from an idea.
00:24 - Computer science is the basis for a lot of the things
00:27 - that students and proffesionals will do
for the next 20 or 30 years.
00:31 - I like programming because I like helping people.
00:34 - I get the opportunity to build something
that's gonna make people's life easier.
00:39 - I think this is the closest thing we have to superpower.
00:41 - Getting started is the most important part.
00:43 - I'm a beginner myself and I want you to learn with me.
00:48 - Hi, my name is Lyndsey,
00:49 - I majored in theater in college, 
but I also majored in computer science.
00:53 - And now I model, act and write my own apps.
00:56 - Let's use code to help Anna and Elsa 
as they explore the magic and beauty of ice.
01:01 - You'll create snowflakes and patterns
as you ice-skate
01:04 - and make a winterwonderland
which you can share with your friends.
01:08 - In the next hour, 
you're going to learn the basics of how to code.
01:12 - Traditional programming is usually in text,
01:14 - but we will use blockly which uses visual blocks,
thatyou can drag and drop to write programs.
01:20 - This is how even university students learn the basics.
01:23 - Under the hood, you are still creating code.
01:26 - The concepts that you will be learning 
are concepts which computer programmers are using every day
01:30 - and are the foundation of computer science.
01:34 - A PROGRAM is a set of instructions 
that tell a computer what to do.
01:38 - Let's build a code for a program that will help Elsa to create a simple line.
01:44 - We will use this later to create more complex patterns.
01:48 - Your screen is split into three main parts:
01:50 - On the left is the ice surface 
where you will run your program.
01:55 - The instructions for each level 
are written right below the surface.
01:59 - This middle area is the toolbox
02:01 - and each of these blocks
is an action Elsa and Anna can do.
02:05 - The white space on the right is called the workspace 
and this is where we will build our program.
02:10 - To move around the ice surface, you will use the "move forward"-block.
02:15 - Here the move forward block says:
"Move forward by 100 pixels".
02:20 - When we press run... What happens?
02:23 - Elsa moves forward a certain amount on the screen...
100 pixels in fact.
02:28 - Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your computer screen.
02:33 - The other block in the puzzle sais:
"turn right by 90 degrees".
02:38 - When we use the "turn right"-block,
that makes elsa turn a certain amount.
02:43 - You can play around with how far you want elsa to turn.
02:46 - The angle is measured from the path ahead of Elsa,
so this is the 90 degree turn...
02:52 - and this is an 120 degree turn.
02:54 - And remember, you can change the number of pixels or degrees
by clicking the arrows next to them.
