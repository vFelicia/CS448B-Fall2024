00:08 - Now that you've learned
how to use Sprite Lab, you're going
00:10 - to want to make your program react
when someone plays with it.
00:14 - To do that, you're going to use events.
00:17 - An event tells your program to listen
00:20 - for something to happen
and then react right away.
00:24 - Some examples of events are listening
for a mouse, click
00:28 - an arrow button, press
or a tap on the screen
00:32 - blocks like when clicked are called
event blocks.
00:37 - The code connected to an event
block runs
00:39 - when the appropriate action is detected.
00:44 - For example, 
00:45 - if I attach this say block to the
when clicked event,
00:50 - my sprite will say something
when the user clicks
00:52 - or taps on it. 
00:56 - Notice that event blocks
don't snap into your main program.
01:01 - Instead, they create
little programs of their own.
01:09 - If you have multiple sprites, 
01:11 - you can use additional events
to tell an interactive story.
01:17 - Hello, Pizza!
01:19 - Avocado, my friend!
01:22 - You'll soon be learning
how to do even more in Sprite lab,
01:26 - including changing the size
or appearance of a sprite,
01:30 - setting different backgrounds, playing
sounds, and more.
01:35 - What do you want your sprites to do
when someone interacts with them?
01:38 - It's up to you.
