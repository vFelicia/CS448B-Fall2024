00:00 - okay we're going hi everybody I'm Alice
00:03 - Stein glass I worked on the new
00:04 - tutorials for our code this year the
00:08 - Star Wars one and the Minecraft one hola
00:12 - we're getting here okay we're now off
00:20 - the air okay sorry about that we now got
00:25 - our technology working here so I run our
00:29 - product and engineering teams here and
00:31 - marketing and this is hadi he's our
00:33 - founder and started the hour of code and
00:36 - we're here to answer any of your
00:39 - questions about running the hour of code
00:41 - with your classroom but before we go
00:44 - into questions I should just say how
00:45 - exciting it is to be one week away from
00:47 - the third annual hour of code for
00:50 - computer science education week you know
00:52 - when we started at this thing it started
00:55 - out as just a simple idea what if we get
00:57 - teachers to do one hour computer science
00:59 - and at back in June of 2013's or two and
01:03 - a half years ago we said this ridiculous
01:04 - goal let's try to get 10 million kids to
01:07 - try to do this in one week and was
01:09 - figurative via chewed for 10 million
01:11 - maybe we'll reach 1 million and
01:13 - hopefully that'll be great in that first
01:15 - week we reached I think 15 million
01:18 - students in the very first week and then
01:20 - last year's our code was literally twice
01:22 - as large this year it looks like it's
01:24 - going to be three or four times as large
01:25 - just based on the number of people who
01:27 - signed up saying they want to do it and
01:29 - this has become such a worldwide affair
01:32 - you know we've heard that the country of
01:34 - malta has told us they want the entire
01:36 - country during the hour of code the
01:38 - island of cocos island in the in the
01:41 - Indian Ocean is going to have all of
01:43 - their 650 inhabitants to the hour of
01:45 - code the ministries of Education of
01:48 - Italy and Russia have said that they're
01:49 - going to ask every single school in the
01:51 - entire country to do the hour of code in
01:53 - Russia is particularly interesting
01:55 - because they refuse to do anything to do
01:57 - with co.org because we're a u.s.
01:59 - organization and the Russian us are kind
02:01 - of in a tough spot right now so they
02:03 - won't talk to us but they're going to do
02:05 - it for every single school in the
02:06 - country which will reach at least 10
02:07 - million students um and then in places
02:10 - like Nigeria we hear about where the
02:13 - bombs
02:13 - violins have been doing an hour of code
02:15 - in Syria there's you know right around
02:18 - all the syrup issues in the civil war
02:20 - that's going on people are participating
02:22 - in one Middle Eastern country that
02:24 - refuses to us identify them there's a
02:27 - girl centric you know girls hour of code
02:30 - much like there are and you know Western
02:32 - countries but in this country we can't
02:34 - promote it because they're worried about
02:35 - a government sort of retribution to the
02:38 - girls that are coding which is just
02:41 - insane but that's still kind of awesome
02:43 - that that's happening and then of course
02:45 - in the United States if you look at the
02:47 - map with the schools participating I
02:48 - think we've kind of broken the map i
02:50 - think as more people register it can't
02:52 - even handle the number yeah one of our
02:54 - top support questions is people asking
02:56 - us why they added there they haven't you
02:58 - added your you sign up you add anything
03:00 - to the map we know you did and it's not
03:03 - showing up on the map uh because too
03:05 - many people thank you looks like I
03:07 - villar Baptist not handling it gallon
03:09 - code is not about how much you can learn
03:12 - in an hour it's about realizing after
03:14 - one hour this is an important feel that
03:16 - every kid kind of can try it can enjoy
03:18 - it and that every school every teacher
03:21 - going to post this in their classroom
03:23 - and that computer science really is a
03:24 - field for everybody not just for the
03:26 - special geniuses not just for the 18
03:28 - year olds and the last two years we've
03:30 - seen 90 different school districts in
03:33 - all the largest cities in the united
03:34 - states adopt computer science for full
03:37 - on curriculum multiple states have done
03:40 - statewide things in multiple countries
03:42 - have done countrywide requirements of
03:44 - computer science being taught as a
03:46 - formal part of the curriculum you know
03:48 - our real goal with the hour of code is
03:49 - to get full computer science courses put
03:51 - into schools the hour of code is just
03:54 - the initial start Adam but anyway it's
03:56 - been an amazing thing we can't wait for
03:58 - next week so it's a great way to break
04:00 - stereotypes I you know I think they're
04:03 - plenty people out there who think that
04:05 - codeine is scary or it's something that
04:07 - happens on your computer you can't touch
04:09 - it and would never enroll in a computer
04:11 - science class so we've talked to a lot
04:12 - of students who do the hour of code and
04:14 - it just helps them realize that it is
04:16 - fun and it's something that they can do
04:18 - and then go on to I just spoke actually
04:20 - a fourteen-year-old girl who is telling
04:22 - me she tried her hour of code you went a
04:23 - little early I'm started yet but she
04:25 - already
04:25 - the hour of code this year she did Star
04:27 - Wars one and she's signing up for her
04:29 - computer science class for school next
04:31 - year in high school and she's never
04:32 - taken in a computer sign that she wasn't
04:34 - going to but she thought it was kind of
04:35 - fun and now she's going to try it out
04:37 - and that's just a great opportunity so
04:38 - thank you everybody who's on the call
04:41 - because you're all I know organizing the
04:42 - hour of code that's why you're calling
04:43 - it and you're giving your kids and
04:45 - incredible opportunity so I want to help
04:46 - you out with that it looks like one of
04:50 - the questions that were being asked is a
04:52 - principal who wants the entire school to
04:55 - participate in the hour of code and and
04:57 - she's looking for some suggestions to
04:58 - organize an event for the whole school
05:01 - hobby do you have thoughts on good ways
05:03 - to get your holster doing it there's a
05:05 - couple things we would say one is that
05:06 - if you go to the hour of code website
05:08 - there's this sort of under the resources
05:11 - on the left hand side it shows her about
05:12 - how to sort of prevent guides and
05:14 - they're actually sort of guides for how
05:17 - to organize at least a school assembly
05:18 - for that kind of an event like the
05:20 - run-up show for what the school assembly
05:22 - should be but then there's a separate
05:24 - question of how do you list achill get
05:26 - every child in a school to do one hour
05:27 - of code if you don't have enough
05:29 - computers and we actually the section
05:32 - you know we stop giving the sort of
05:34 - prizes for whole schools that do this
05:36 - but actually the the section that talks
05:37 - about that we've actually put draft
05:39 - plans for how a whole school could do an
05:41 - hour of code and I know if it's possible
05:43 - to does that you can chat window alright
05:46 - it's very sore point out for most
05:48 - schools you don't have computers for
05:49 - everybody do it all at once and that's
05:51 - totally fine it's awesome to bring the
05:54 - school and for an assembly around the
05:56 - concept of computer science or what
05:57 - computer science is we've got a bunch of
05:59 - inspirational videos on the website that
06:01 - are great way to kick that off and
06:02 - whether you do that in a big assembly or
06:03 - you do that in individual classes the
06:06 - videos I you know I played them with
06:08 - everything from second graders to first
06:10 - graders up through high school and
06:12 - they're really fun for all ages and
06:14 - there's some great videos on there and
06:16 - it just gets people excited and shows
06:17 - you know maybe you don't know what
06:19 - computer science is so it's hard for you
06:20 - to answer the question about what is
06:22 - computer science or what I do with
06:23 - computer science the video is a good way
06:25 - to show that and we've also got a really
06:26 - diverse set of role models in those
06:28 - videos so you know students can see
06:30 - themselves and say oh you know people
06:32 - who look like me or people who are doing
06:34 - fun things and doing exciting things
06:36 - with computer science that's a great way
06:37 - to start it out
06:39 - for the logistics of getting the whole
06:40 - school through it whether that means
06:42 - moving the laptop carts from classroom
06:45 - to classroom or whether that means
06:46 - having the kids going through the
06:47 - computer lab either those are the best
06:48 - ways to do it and for a school that
06:50 - doesn't have laptop carts and or doesn't
06:52 - have a computer lab there's a other
06:55 - strategies one is frankly to do the
06:56 - unplugged tutorials all I need is a
06:58 - bunch of paper cups and paper to do with
07:01 - the easiest unplug tutorials or if you
07:03 - have some devices you can have kids
07:05 - pinner programming side by side you can
07:07 - have a teacher working on a smart screen
07:09 - and just having the teacher themselves
07:11 - do the coding and asking kids to show of
07:13 - hands say what should I do next let the
07:16 - kids suggest and then also many of the
07:18 - tutorials that we highlight are designed
07:20 - for smartphones and tablets so you know
07:23 - older age kids in high schools you know
07:25 - that they have their own smartphones in
07:27 - it to eat they just download the apps
07:29 - their smartphones all these absolute we
07:31 - press the ones that we promote to be
07:32 - free apps the owning to pay phone so all
07:34 - of those are different ways for a school
07:36 - that doesn't have enough devices good um
07:38 - actually you said one thing there I just
07:41 - pair programming which is really cool
07:42 - and worth the worth taking a moment to
07:44 - talk about because it's not just a
07:46 - concept for classrooms people actually
07:48 - do it in computer science as well in the
07:50 - workforce that you know you'll have two
07:52 - people working on a computer together to
07:53 - program and in classrooms especially for
07:55 - an hour of code into our code it can be
07:57 - really fun to have 22 students working
07:59 - together because they can talk to each
08:01 - other they have somebody to support them
08:02 - it's a collaborative effort and can be a
08:04 - lot of fun too in your classroom whether
08:06 - or not you have enough computers for
08:08 - every student you should think about
08:09 - whether your class would have more fun
08:11 - if they had a couple people working
08:12 - together at each computer I see another
08:15 - question that follows on sort of similar
08:17 - to the whole school thing and there's
08:19 - something we hear a lot which is you
08:21 - have a bunch of different grade levels
08:22 - and how do you how do you register the
08:26 - different grade levels to get a variety
08:27 - of code experiences so what is how do
08:30 - you find the right the right tutorial
08:31 - the right level of coding for all the
08:33 - different grade levels at your school
08:35 - sure if this depends on what the kids
08:39 - experiences you know first of all
08:40 - beginners that coding it doesn't matter
08:42 - what age they are if you're doing it for
08:44 - the first time at whether you're 30
08:46 - years old or four years old you kind of
08:49 - want to start with the basics
08:50 - so at and most of the tutorials of coded
08:52 - or provides are designed really to be
08:55 - for all ages and really at the beginner
08:58 - level the only sort of special ages pre
09:00 - readers you know kids that can actually
09:02 - read you want to have weren't using with
09:05 - the tutorials that's designed for that
09:06 - age group so for example light light
09:08 - bought or boxy Island or two iphone apps
09:11 - that are if it is great foods that are
09:13 - designed for yes and those are all
09:14 - labeled last time you maybe have tons of
09:16 - questions from people asking about
09:18 - kindergartners a pre reader so I know
09:19 - there's probably a bunch of you on there
09:20 - if you are looking for pre readers if
09:24 - you go to code.org / learn and you look
09:26 - down on the page there's a section
09:28 - therefore it's labeled for beginners for
09:31 - kindergarten through grade eight and if
09:32 - you go in there if you flip through them
09:34 - it'll be labeled some of them are
09:35 - labeled for pre readers those are great
09:37 - if you have kindergarten as you can't
09:38 - read yet or even Lake preschool but for
09:41 - the kids who can read any age can start
09:44 - with the minecraft tutorial it's a
09:46 - fantastic one and if they're already
09:47 - experienced its long about age it's
09:49 - about experience if they've already done
09:51 - enough drag and drop coating that they
09:53 - want to move to javascript in our own
09:55 - Star Wars tutorial lets you switch to
09:56 - JavaScript mode or the Khan Academy
09:58 - tutorial or any of their the ones that
10:00 - teach JavaScript are sort of the next
10:02 - thing to go through you know we've tried
10:04 - to categorize and present many of them
10:05 - on the code or website and there's
10:08 - actually many websites now if you just
10:10 - google hour of code tutorials there's
10:12 - actual web says that can help you find
10:14 - in search different and choose the best
10:15 - ones as a question do you know the
10:20 - people in scratch and yes we know that
10:23 - the people in scratch add we're not
10:26 - working together with them you know they
10:27 - scratches its own tool in co.org built
10:29 - its own programming platform and scratch
10:31 - has built a tablet version of scratch
10:34 - jr. which is designed for elementary
10:36 - schools but it only works on iPads not
10:39 - on Android tablets and it's only for
10:42 - scratch jr. so so it's not the full
10:44 - scratch there's a company called tinker
10:47 - that makes a product that's very much
10:49 - like scratch and it's a for-profit
10:51 - company not a non-profit as so some of
10:54 - the versions of what they do you need to
10:55 - pay for what the basic entry level is
10:57 - free and they have kind of a mobile
11:00 - version of all the types of things you
11:01 - could do in scratch
11:04 - question them here about what happens if
11:08 - you come and her back from ala tyr yet
11:10 - oh you haven't heard back from a
11:12 - volunteer so we've also we this is the
11:15 - volunteer system is new this year and we
11:17 - heard for you guys for the last couple
11:18 - of years that people really wanted
11:20 - volunteers to come into the classroom um
11:22 - to just help you know again if you don't
11:25 - do computer science if you know if
11:27 - you're not closely connected to it it
11:29 - can be great to bring somebody from
11:30 - industry and um you know just to see
11:32 - what is what does it computer programmer
11:33 - do what are they doing they inspire the
11:35 - kids let them talk someone let them ask
11:36 - their questions and so this year we
11:39 - asked you guys if you wanted to
11:41 - volunteer and we saw that there were
11:43 - lots and lots of people saying yes about
11:45 - 20,000 teachers say that they wanted a
11:47 - volunteer so we went out to lots of
11:50 - industries and universities nasty people
11:52 - to volunteer we've got about 10,000
11:54 - volunteers who are happy to come into
11:56 - one or more classrooms um but it's up to
11:59 - you to go reach out to them and we don't
12:02 - want to give them your email address we
12:03 - haven't given them any information about
12:04 - you or your school or any way to contact
12:06 - you so the only way they can contact you
12:08 - is if you go to the site and you find a
12:10 - volunteer near you you can find we
12:12 - recommend asking three of them um you
12:15 - know we have not done any vetting of
12:16 - them um you know I've talked to a bunch
12:18 - who are excited to come in and help and
12:20 - happy to volunteer in the classroom but
12:22 - we have not if not to embedding some of
12:25 - them may be irresponsible and not write
12:27 - back um you know they have not done any
12:30 - background checks on them so that's up
12:31 - to you to do whatever your school does
12:32 - for background checks and if it's easier
12:35 - you know with only a few days left for
12:37 - hours between now an hour of code to not
12:38 - go through that process and just have
12:41 - them skype into the classroom that's
12:42 - also possible if your contact a
12:45 - volunteer and they have not gotten back
12:46 - to you definitely owe contact another
12:48 - one or two or three um I'd recommend
12:50 - contacting three because that increases
12:53 - the chance to get back to you and
12:54 - general we've had 20,000 teachers tell
12:57 - us they want volunteers we have about
12:59 - eight eight or nine thousand volunteers
13:00 - signed up yeah but not even all eight
13:03 - thousand have you even been contacted to
13:05 - begin with which means that over half
13:06 - the teachers who want to volunteer in
13:08 - the classroom I haven't actually spent
13:11 - the time to try to reach out so if
13:13 - you're interested in having somebody
13:14 - come inspire kids are just help out
13:16 - please take advantage of
13:17 - tool to reach out to them yeah and
13:19 - definitely I mean I know that our
13:20 - volunteers are somewhat concentrated in
13:22 - sort of the tech areas so you know a lot
13:25 - of volunteers in San Francisco we have a
13:27 - lot of volunteers in Seattle of places
13:28 - where there are a lot of tech companies
13:29 - we might have fewer in other places but
13:31 - definitely a lot of volunteers are
13:33 - excited about doing a skype or a remote
13:34 - called google hangout into your
13:36 - classroom so if there's a if you're
13:38 - interested in that you should just reach
13:39 - out to them anywhere and anywhere in the
13:41 - world and see if you can find somebody
13:42 - who would want to do that with you
13:45 - there's a question about should I assign
13:48 - a particular program for my students to
13:50 - work on in order to monitor their
13:52 - progress that's first of all up to you
13:56 - although we've tried to make sure that
13:58 - none of the tutorials for an hour code
13:59 - requires students sign up so our own
14:02 - tutorials you can go through a student
14:04 - signup process and a teacher signup
14:06 - process and then assign the tutorial to
14:08 - the students then you get a dashboard to
14:10 - see their progress but that's a lot of
14:13 - effort for just one class that's the
14:15 - type of effort you want to do if you're
14:16 - going to to teach us for 10 or 215 hours
14:19 - worth of multiple classes for just the
14:21 - first hour it's a little bit easier to
14:23 - just say hey everybody go to this link
14:25 - and give it a shot and monitor their
14:27 - progress by walking around the classroom
14:29 - that also has the benefit of letting
14:31 - some kids if they do it faster jump and
14:33 - try something else at and that generally
14:36 - works a little bit better for the single
14:38 - our kind of activity we also on all of
14:40 - our tutorials we wanted to make easy for
14:42 - you to see what's going on if you walk
14:44 - around the classroom so right at the top
14:45 - of the screen there's a little bar that
14:47 - shows you their progress and how far
14:48 - along they are so you can see just sort
14:50 - of glancing over their shoulders you
14:52 - know who might be getting stuff or who's
14:54 - behind or where they are so that's you
14:56 - know definitely I just recommend just
14:58 - letting them go for it and you can see
14:59 - it you can look around the classroom the
15:02 - goal is really just to have fun they're
15:04 - not designed that they have to finish it
15:06 - in an hour um and it's great if a
15:09 - student does you know if there's a 20
15:11 - hour 20 puzzle progression and they do
15:13 - seven of those puzzles that's fantastic
15:14 - it's not it's not there's no you know
15:17 - you need to finish it in order to do
15:19 - your hour of code some of them are
15:21 - designed so that you know if you're a
15:23 - high school student might take the whole
15:24 - time and a you know a younger student
15:26 - might have more time to get through it
15:28 - if somebody's had experienced coding
15:29 - they might get through faster
15:30 - and then we have sort of players at the
15:33 - end where they can keep playing and
15:34 - doing more if they get through it well
15:39 - you were your website showcase any
15:41 - schools or classrooms that participate
15:43 - yes we always you know we tweet we we're
15:48 - trying to put together a page and this
15:49 - year just a bunch of showcases so if you
15:52 - are doing the hour of code if you can
15:54 - share pictures share tweet share
15:57 - anything you want on social media and
15:59 - tagged hour of code we would love to see
16:01 - it and we would love to share those more
16:03 - broadly with other people who are who
16:05 - are doing it so yeah tag hour of code
16:07 - that would be great and see and what I
16:12 - would def depressing answer the to Marin
16:16 - Kelly Tauruses question which is wonder
16:17 - will receive the posters which is we
16:20 - under-budgeted or actually under
16:22 - expected how many teachers would sign up
16:24 - and ask for posters so we've actually
16:25 - ran out of them in calf length of time
16:27 - so unfortunately the first I think 20 or
16:31 - something thousand people who ask for
16:32 - posters will get them there's at least
16:34 - 10,000 people who've asked for posters
16:36 - who won't and this partly because from a
16:40 - budgeting sampling boats literally we
16:41 - needed to print them in advance and
16:42 - guess how many we need and we tried to
16:44 - guess more than we need and we fell
16:47 - short so if you haven't received posters
16:49 - yet they're not coming unfortunately
16:50 - there's enough demand that we're going
16:52 - to come up with a way to basically make
16:54 - them available afterwards but at have to
16:58 - apologize that they're not available
16:59 - yeah we've had three times as many
17:01 - people sign up to organize the hour of
17:03 - code is we had last year are close to
17:06 - three times as many and that's that we
17:09 - did percent growth yeah and we are
17:13 - having tripling of everything which is a
17:15 - little bit hard to deal with so thank
17:17 - you for doing it and we'll try to keep
17:20 - up so do it other whether it's a good
17:24 - question about community events I was it
17:26 - get be oh just sorry as people are
17:30 - entering I'm they're moving so I mean it
17:31 - had to get participants to promote the
17:33 - event if it is going to be a community
17:35 - event how do you Anna sure um so the if
17:41 - something is going to be a community
17:42 - event first of all we recommend using
17:44 - your own local sort of avenues for doing
17:46 - that kind of stuff if you look at the
17:47 - hour of code websites there's actually a
17:49 - number of resources specifically for
17:51 - promoting whether it's the logo banners
17:54 - or things to put on webpages suggested
17:56 - tweets suggested social media you know
17:59 - arm the map we have on our website both
18:01 - the CSI week website and the hour of
18:03 - toilet website gets a lot of visitors
18:05 - but it doesn't get a lot of visitors
18:06 - among parents it gets visitors among
18:08 - teachers at and most parents I don't
18:11 - think are actually proactively going
18:13 - somewhere to figure out where their kids
18:15 - can do an hour of code so local PTA type
18:18 - things or places where parents would
18:20 - actually find here use however get
18:23 - spreading the word so an easy question
18:25 - here from a IT administrator they're
18:28 - asking how they can make sure that the
18:29 - tutorials work and that's what I
18:32 - recommend everybody just try before they
18:33 - start their hour of code from your
18:36 - school just because the school might
18:38 - have certain websites that are white
18:39 - listed or not whitelisted try from the
18:42 - device that you're going to be using
18:43 - going to the tutorial and playing
18:44 - through it just double check to make
18:45 - sure it works if you're using one of the
18:47 - code or tutorials we have AIT
18:50 - requirements site which tells you what
18:51 - to whitelist basically it's a you know
18:54 - code Oregon studio gorg and start our
18:57 - code I mean I'm co.org and yeah makes it
19:00 - easy but if you're um and then you know
19:04 - optionally can also do YouTube but even
19:06 - just code.org will work we're gonna need
19:08 - you to you don't need youtube so good
19:10 - don't work if using one of the other
19:12 - tutorials I don't know what your site
19:13 - has white listed or what you need to
19:15 - whitelist to do that tutorial probably
19:16 - depends on the tutorial so just try it
19:18 - in your try it out before you get
19:19 - started that's a great thing to do just
19:21 - check out make sure the tutorial works
19:22 - that's also a good way to check to make
19:24 - sure the device you're going to be using
19:26 - so be using iPads or tablets or
19:28 - computers you just want to try the
19:30 - tutorial on the device you're using to
19:31 - make sure it's going to work well for
19:32 - that device um there's a question from
19:35 - Luann's saying or looking as saying
19:38 - since my class already spent time last
19:39 - week does it count they'll of course it
19:42 - counts you know the point for the hour
19:44 - of code isn't that everybody has to do
19:46 - it during the same week in fact there's
19:48 - millions of people that are already
19:49 - starting right now and there will be
19:50 - millions of people will go one week late
19:52 - because of final exams or
19:54 - like that at you know we can't
19:57 - participation this literally year round
19:59 - but next week is basically the big leap
20:02 - when tens of millions of students
20:04 - worldwide at every participating which
20:05 - is what makes it exciting I think
20:07 - there's actually a pretty good chance we
20:08 - reach 100 million students in one week
20:11 - we'll see it's a day so this will be our
20:19 - third hour of code event we are trying
20:21 - to turn it into a year-long activity
20:23 - with competition as the motivation how
20:25 - can I carry this over calculate carry
20:28 - this over year to year and allow the
20:30 - students to keep their progress of our
20:32 - school site admin for monitoring
20:34 - progress teacher dashboard yeah well I
20:38 - mean I think if you're doing that
20:41 - depends on whether you're using the code
20:43 - or tutorials or yeah picking your own if
20:45 - you use the code or tutorials that the
20:49 - three tutorial platforms and that we
20:51 - recommend that i know that do monitor
20:52 - student progress are the codes tinkers
20:56 - and Khan Academy's I believe also code
20:59 - HS and code Academy at the high school
21:01 - level do as well so if you use any of
21:04 - those five tutorial providers you can
21:06 - actually set up teacher account student
21:08 - accounts and even if you use them for
21:10 - one hour a year you can get that
21:12 - progress year and the student accounts
21:14 - stay the same but if you're doing it as
21:16 - a year-long thing i would highly
21:17 - recommend getting student logins and the
21:20 - teacher logins for any of those systems
21:22 - so the ones that i mentioned were coded
21:25 - org tinker khan academy code Academy and
21:29 - code HS all have student progress
21:32 - bachelor's and I think another another
21:35 - piece to that is if you're going to be
21:36 - there sort of I couldn't really tell her
21:38 - two different questions they want us to
21:39 - do you know hour of code this year at
21:41 - our if code next year and continue to
21:43 - make it a thing to build the other is
21:44 - you know beyond the hour of code the
21:46 - kids have fun I want to keep going I
21:48 - want to you know do more computer
21:49 - science I want to bring this out into
21:50 - the school year and if you go to us
21:54 - code.org / well / learn is where all the
21:58 - tutorials are / learned beyond we have a
22:01 - list of all sorts of things you can do
22:04 - that go beyond the hour of code so
22:07 - we have tutorials at code.org 20 our
22:08 - courses that you can work in any through
22:11 - grades K through 8 and there are lots of
22:13 - other great options out there like Khan
22:15 - Academy code HS tinker of code Academy
22:19 - that will let your kids keep going
22:21 - throughout the year alright um there's a
22:26 - question about the code.org website
22:27 - crashing next week due to so much
22:29 - activity we had hiccups on the site last
22:31 - year first I'll be first to apologize
22:34 - for last year we had one and a half days
22:37 - of extremely foresight downtime during
22:40 - the our code and i'll take the personal
22:44 - going for that this year I'm quite sure
22:46 - it won't happen for multiple reasons
22:47 - basically because of last year's
22:49 - experience as the issue of last year was
22:52 - basically if one part of our side
22:54 - couldn't hold up or take the whole site
22:55 - down and the parts of our site that end
22:58 - up taking the most effort to run from a
23:01 - database template are things about
23:03 - involve things like student logins and
23:05 - what we're doing this year is making it
23:07 - too we can shut off individual subparts
23:09 - to co.org site while the actual core
23:11 - hour of code one hour sequence literally
23:14 - barely needs to hit our computers so if
23:17 - things go our I because we really can't
23:20 - predict how much the traffic will be we
23:21 - can gradually shut off all the rest of
23:24 - our site except the part that everybody
23:25 - wants to stay up just to make sure that
23:27 - that part stays up I would not worry
23:29 - about it new a question you're about oh
23:34 - my gosh a question here about swag which
23:39 - I just put in our showcase links so we
23:44 - have a blog post on the code or blog
23:46 - that will step you through ordering
23:48 - customized hour of code t-shirts is it a
23:51 - blog code it's on blog code org and I
23:54 - link to it directly in the links for
23:56 - this yeah so Nadia if you want to order
23:59 - customized t-shirts or for anybody else
24:01 - who's not familiar with that at we have
24:03 - a tee shirt template that basically has
24:06 - an hour of code logo and those are I
24:08 - think two different templates where you
24:09 - can enter your school name and order a
24:12 - teacher it's an order from custom inc
24:14 - com so we're not the ones creating the
24:15 - t-shirts we've made the template
24:17 - available on crafts custom ink and
24:19 - anybody can change the time
24:20 - to make your own t-shirts and order them
24:22 - from customer think i'm at blog co.org
24:26 - is the place to find a link for that um
24:32 - so this one is my students have created
24:35 - their accounts and have been doing the
24:37 - tutorials and they are cooked what will
24:39 - they do on the day we do hour of code in
24:40 - class um well if you've got there's no
24:43 - way to get all the tutorials there are
24:45 - over 20 tutorials we'll just different
24:48 - brands and then there's with each of
24:49 - them I me taker has five different
24:51 - tutorials you could do and um
24:53 - everybody's got lots of tutorials up
24:55 - there so there's no way you're going to
24:56 - run out of tutorials during um during an
24:58 - hour of code but if you're and you know
25:00 - another common question we get is my
25:02 - students did it last year and they're
25:04 - coming back and they we just want to
25:08 - know what I should do this year cuz i've
25:09 - got some students who are in my class or
25:11 - weren't in my class I don't know what
25:12 - they've done so to at the very top that
25:15 - we've got a brand new this year are the
25:17 - star wars and minecraft ones so if your
25:19 - students did do hour of code last year
25:21 - they have not done those unless you sign
25:23 - them up last week and they already have
25:24 - their accounts in which case they might
25:25 - have done those and then I would just
25:27 - let your kids I mean if your kids have
25:29 - had experience and they've done it
25:30 - before and you've got different kids
25:31 - have done different things what options
25:32 - just to let everybody do the real thing
25:34 - all of the tutorials are self-guided and
25:36 - you can let the students try different
25:38 - tutorials and let them sort of explore
25:40 - and have fun especially if their
25:41 - experience and they've tried this before
25:42 - they might have a lot of fun with that
25:44 - there's a question from Christie about
25:46 - do you think what will you be able to do
25:49 - code a tree this year and that was the
25:52 - last year a special promotion with the
25:54 - White House to actually write code to
25:56 - basically light up the White House
25:58 - Christmas lights and basically in
26:00 - connection with that you have they
26:02 - briefly did an actual event with the
26:03 - Christmas lights and then made a sort of
26:05 - coding project or on that but because
26:07 - the white house isn't parts fitting that
26:08 - particular thing this year I don't
26:10 - believe that's the middle one more have
26:12 - but the group that made that out of
26:14 - google called made with code is is
26:16 - coming out with a new tutorial this year
26:17 - that should be pretty fun um I don't see
26:23 - we're still can create an account okay
26:25 - so if you're looking for your students
26:27 - to get out again you don't need to
26:29 - create an app actually it would be
26:31 - better not to bother the job doesn't
26:33 - work for
26:34 - you let's work for you and you don't
26:36 - imagine up to deal with it the kids
26:38 - don't need to log in our recommendation
26:40 - is don't have the students create
26:41 - accounts if you do want to create an
26:44 - account the reason to do that would be
26:47 - because you're planning on teaching more
26:48 - than just the hour of code so if you
26:50 - want to do the hour of code and you want
26:52 - to keep going and you want to you know
26:53 - maybe do one of twenty our courses
26:55 - that's where it makes sense to create an
26:56 - account and with young kids I actually
26:59 - start not by having your students go
27:00 - create their own account but start by
27:02 - creating your account on the teacher
27:03 - dashboard and then the very first link
27:05 - there is to set up your classroom and
27:06 - you can set up a classroom for your
27:08 - students and give them all logins which
27:10 - are either picture passwords or words
27:12 - you just give them to write down that
27:15 - way if they forget it you can always
27:16 - give him a new word or new picture
27:18 - password and you're in charge of it and
27:19 - they're all part of your classroom and
27:21 - you can manage the whole thing but again
27:23 - just don't bother our code we'd actually
27:25 - pressed every tutorial provider to
27:28 - remove their sign up requirements that
27:30 - your kids can just click link and start
27:32 - coding do it for one class and be done
27:34 - and go home and not need to worry about
27:36 - that stuff for the ongoing courses you
27:39 - know on our site if you look at code
27:41 - studio in the URL estudio coorg there's
27:44 - a wealth of courses there's about eight
27:46 - or nine different one hour versus but
27:47 - about a hundred hours worth of ongoing
27:50 - curriculum which will take weeks and
27:52 - weeks to go through depending on what
27:53 - age range you're in and for those if you
27:56 - go to studio about co.org the teacher
27:58 - dashboard set up in a student accounts
28:00 - that are all the ways to do that i'm
28:04 - going to repeat for the posters because
28:07 - that's come up you half times i just
28:08 - want to apologize for the teachers who
28:10 - ordered posters and didn't receive them
28:12 - we ran out and we just basically didn't
28:15 - print enough we expect it to have almost
28:19 - double fifty fifty to sixty percent more
28:21 - participants than last year we've had
28:23 - three hundred percent more participants
28:25 - than last year so we grossly
28:27 - underestimated how many posters
28:28 - difference and I'm sorry you can by the
28:32 - way somebody had mentioned up here you
28:34 - can print your own posters if you have a
28:35 - printer all the PDF files for our for
28:38 - our posters are exactly available and we
28:40 - will soon make available a link to
28:42 - purchase posters we're not sure those
28:44 - will be deliverable in the time you get
28:45 - there for next week
28:47 - so Lee has a question oh please question
28:50 - yessuh lee lees had a question about
28:52 - whether or not his students need to
28:53 - create accounts if they were going to do
28:55 - the ongoing courses and you you can use
28:58 - the outgoing courses without accounts
28:59 - but you would want to create accounts if
29:01 - your students are going to be doing the
29:02 - ongoing courses because it would let you
29:04 - see what's going on in the classroom
29:05 - lets you manage the classroom it lets
29:07 - you see the progress of your students
29:08 - all the different courses so yes if you
29:11 - want to sign up to do longer the hundred
29:13 - hours he was talking about then yeah go
29:15 - ahead and do create apps for yourself
29:16 - and the for your students there's a
29:19 - question from LuAnn saying if students
29:22 - use my classroom and code studio and
29:24 - they have a personal account to the
29:26 - lines of code combined the answer is
29:29 - only if the students account actually is
29:31 - part of your classroom if their own
29:33 - personal account is separate for your
29:34 - classroom they don't combine but if a
29:38 - student has their own separate account
29:39 - they can add you as their teachers who
29:42 - don't need to have two separate accounts
29:43 - with the same key students and is
29:45 - actually user interface for students to
29:47 - effectively invite a teacher to to join
29:49 - that teacher's classroom that said I
29:52 - would kind of not worry about the total
29:54 - lines of code it's just kind of a fun
29:55 - counter but it's not the most important
29:57 - thing at all of the students who care
30:00 - about it I guess it must be important
30:04 - take that and the question is are there
30:08 - any learning tutorials for
30:10 - object-oriented programming programming
30:11 - like C++ or Java if you look at our
30:16 - other programming languages tutorials I
30:18 - believe there are a number of these the
30:21 - and I don't can't think of one directly
30:24 - off the top of my head but I would say
30:26 - that object oriented programming isn't
30:27 - necessarily the first way to start if
30:29 - you introduce somebody to just one hour
30:31 - of coding the if these are kids who
30:34 - already have done computer science and
30:36 - you know have done basic coding and want
30:39 - to learn object-oriented programming
30:40 - then I would look at the frankly regular
30:45 - curriculum for computer science for
30:46 - doing that not just one hour versus and
30:49 - and there's many options of that if you
30:51 - look at our learn beyond page to find
30:53 - options for that
31:05 - the question is can a student use
31:07 - basically Google sign-on on a Chromebook
31:09 - instead of code or to sign up at we
31:13 - first for the hour of code suggest not
31:15 - to even bother creating a sign up there
31:17 - really for one hour of activity is not
31:19 - essential that said co.org sign up does
31:23 - support google accounts at and i'm not
31:26 - sure if that automatically works with
31:28 - the single sign-on on Chromebooks but
31:30 - but if you log in with a google account
31:32 - works I believe that should just
31:34 - automatically let you log in if you say
31:36 - create an account using your google
31:38 - account so we have a question here about
31:42 - whether a student account can be
31:44 - attached to multiple teachers so give a
31:46 - special teacher and a homeland teacher
31:48 - and again don't bother for the hour of
31:54 - go to create accounts don't bother
31:55 - percentage of teachers but this is
31:57 - probably from somebody who's actually
31:58 - doing the longer courses and doing that
32:00 - a co studio you can't do it today
32:02 - because a figure list it's kind of
32:04 - complicated how you how you get them
32:06 - into um depending what you're trying to
32:09 - do the answer is yes but it's not super
32:11 - easy grazie the students need to
32:13 - individually at the teacher yes second
32:16 - teacher has a teacher on their account
32:17 - yeah we are trying to right now because
32:20 - we've gotten a bunch of requests for
32:21 - that were working on a feature to make
32:22 - that a little easier so you can put
32:24 - multiple teachers on there but if you
32:25 - have if the two teachers are in two
32:27 - different courses just have them put the
32:29 - course goes for both of the two
32:30 - different classes there in individually
32:32 - from the students account and then
32:33 - you'll be in both classes I have another
32:43 - course minecraft them to complete their
32:45 - them okay so here's somebody who did set
32:48 - up their class and built a class and put
32:50 - all the students in it and again you
32:52 - don't have to do that but if you do do
32:55 - it and she assigned a frozen so Christi
32:58 - decided frozen as the tutorial they're
33:00 - all going to do and that will work great
33:02 - if some of them finish and they're ready
33:04 - to go on they can go ahead and click on
33:07 - any of the other tutorials without you
33:08 - bothering to assign them to your class
33:10 - even if you haven't assigned minecraft
33:12 - to your class to do what i would do is
33:15 - just write on the board for everybody
33:16 - code.org / MC and tell the students when
33:19 - they're done they can just go to that
33:20 - URL and do it or if they go back to the
33:23 - homepage on code studio or when they're
33:26 - done it will like when they click when
33:28 - they get to the end there will be a
33:29 - certificate and it says more courses if
33:31 - they click there you'll see minecraft
33:33 - right there and you can just tell them
33:34 - to go ahead and do minecraft and there's
33:36 - no reason you should sign that to your
33:37 - class um the other recommendation that
33:39 - had whether it's for Christie or anybody
33:41 - else you'll always have kids who finish
33:43 - faster one option is to have them jump
33:46 - to another tutorial another option is to
33:48 - have them go around and help other kids
33:50 - that will make your own life as a
33:52 - teacher slightly easier there's
33:53 - inevitably one or two kids who've
33:55 - already done this stuff and they know it
33:57 - all and for them to help the other kids
33:59 - is actually a different form of learning
34:01 - for everybody and makes for a more sort
34:04 - of engaging how a classroom experience
34:06 - oh and we got an answer guess
34:08 - Chromebooks work with my google account
34:10 - my students try today so thank you glad
34:12 - to hear it worked out great for you so
34:14 - yes the answer is yes a question about
34:19 - Oh logs activities so it has 300
34:22 - students and they do not have great
34:24 - internet so actually if you don't have
34:26 - great internet there are two options one
34:28 - is student unclogged activity the other
34:31 - if you have computers but no internet is
34:32 - to do one of the activities where you
34:34 - can download it in advance to the
34:35 - computers and they're in the unplugged
34:37 - section if you go through it you'll see
34:39 - some blockley tutorials and we're going
34:41 - to see us before the hour of code monday
34:42 - hopefully we get some more unplug
34:44 - tutorials working on it right now that
34:46 - you can download in advance but also the
34:49 - unplug eat orioles are great um they're
34:51 - especially great they're really great
34:53 - with all ages this is two types
34:55 - unplugged means without even a computer
34:57 - offline means with the computer but it's
35:00 - not connected to the Internet we
35:01 - actually called it both unplugged up a
35:03 - little bit they're both games is the
35:05 - same section for business unplugged and
35:08 - offline yeah was the unplugged tutorials
35:10 - alice is talking about feel like coding
35:13 - but they don't involve a computer it
35:14 - involve one student giving instructions
35:16 - and the other student acts like the
35:18 - computer to act out those instructions
35:20 - yeah and it gives you the same sort of
35:22 - experience
35:23 - of coding and problem solving without
35:25 - the excitement of the computer reacting
35:27 - and about the fun of Star Wars for
35:29 - minecrafter or angry birds you think
35:32 - it's out ugh it is actually quite
35:34 - fun in a classroom because the kids
35:35 - interacted they're building things you
35:38 - know they're stacking cups so you can
35:41 - totally do it if you have 300 students
35:43 - doing it um you know it's great if you
35:46 - could you know break them out into
35:47 - smaller groups and a lot of the
35:50 - activities they'll pick one that will
35:51 - work well for your students and their
35:53 - age range but a lot of the activities
35:55 - you do with partners with pairs or the
35:56 - small group and so you can break them
35:58 - out and have them do that activity
35:59 - together I've done it with classrooms
36:02 - and it's been a blast especially you
36:04 - know little kids love to run around so
36:05 - depending on how old they are it can be
36:07 - great yeah for the school that have
36:09 - asked with 300 students by the way if
36:11 - you have bad internet you don't
36:12 - necessarily need fast internet for 25 or
36:16 - 30 kids simultaneously to be doing
36:17 - Darryl code the only part that is on our
36:21 - tutorials that is sort of expensive on
36:22 - the internet is the videos and those can
36:24 - be played on a smart board have all the
36:26 - kids in the room see that once and then
36:28 - happen just do the coding without the
36:29 - videos and the actual individual levels
36:33 - for 25 kids at once won't be that
36:36 - difficult but you know hopefully we'll
36:38 - have offline versions of the tutorials
36:41 - available by Monday and if not as the
36:43 - unplug tutorials will work as well yeah
36:46 - so we have a request for google
36:48 - classroom integration in the future yeah
36:51 - google classroom was awesome we don't
36:53 - currently integrate with it we are
36:54 - looking at that so thank you for the
36:56 - request if you guys have any other
36:57 - requests there's a feedback link in our
37:00 - on the site and we'd love to hear the
37:04 - things that you guys are looking for for
37:06 - us to add to the site so thank you for
37:07 - the the feature request I don't
37:12 - understand your beliefs questions lately
37:14 - do you think the our pop more bang if we
37:18 - get a volunteer or do you have a cool
37:19 - video intro yeah um so I think you know
37:24 - I think you should definitely do the
37:26 - video intro whether or not you get a
37:28 - volunteer I think just a great way to
37:29 - start off with the classroom it's fun I
37:32 - you know and it's super short so it's
37:34 - not a long video of all the
37:36 - videos are designed to be somewhere
37:37 - between like our short ones about 90
37:39 - seconds um shortest one is 60 60 seconds
37:42 - so 60 seconds we've got up to 10 minutes
37:45 - but you know somewhere in the 60
37:47 - depending on how old the kids are 60
37:49 - seconds two minutes three minutes is a
37:52 - good if you don't know where the amount
37:53 - an intro videos are if you try either
37:55 - the minecraft tutorial or the Star Wars
37:57 - tutorial they show a bunch of
37:58 - inspirational videos there's multiple
38:00 - links throughout our website for how to
38:01 - find them there's six of them any of
38:03 - them are fantastic and whether you have
38:06 - a volunteer or not I would definitely
38:07 - use that yeah the reason to get our
38:10 - volunteers if you want somebody else
38:11 - helping in the classroom first of all is
38:14 - another hand friendly and who has some
38:16 - tech familiarity and knows a little bit
38:18 - about the about coding and then if you
38:20 - have that person then they can also talk
38:21 - more about what they do at a personal
38:24 - level in their job and what you know
38:25 - nearby you know tech industry jobs or
38:29 - like and students may not be able to
38:30 - connect with what they're doing here for
38:32 - one hour connects to your career and
38:34 - that's not as easy that our volunteer
38:35 - o'clock and for the volunteer talking I
38:38 - think you know most of the fun four hour
38:40 - of code is actually doing the activities
38:43 - so you don't want your volunteer talking
38:45 - for 45 minutes at the front of the room
38:47 - so what I would do is kick it off play
38:49 - the video introduce the volunteer let
38:51 - the students do the activity save you
38:53 - know five to ten minutes at the end them
38:55 - to ask questions the volunteer not
38:56 - they've done a little coding about was
38:58 - to promote what it means to do coding in
39:00 - a real job yeah and if you have more
39:03 - time you could extend it with the
39:04 - volunteer but I recommended both pieces
39:07 - Khalifa girls on the whiteboard and you
39:10 - know Starbucks ok I can recommend area
39:12 - so this is Kate she's been hiding off
39:15 - camera and she's going to write some
39:17 - URLs for us do you think okay so I asked
39:22 - my students okay uh I'm in a one-to-one
39:26 - computing and running our sites
39:28 - commutable right one lower they can't
39:30 - see that who's slightly lower um okay um
39:36 - Santino's asked a question about
39:37 - basically our district point person else
39:41 - as sheriff section codes for each
39:42 - tutorial and how I built the track how
39:45 - many of our students are logged in using
39:47 - it or will be the only one and
39:50 - Santino there's a hard way for you to
39:52 - all subtract it but it's not easy enough
39:54 - to bother I would say that the short
39:57 - answer is the district point person will
39:59 - be the only one but not to really bother
40:00 - with it you know the goal of the our
40:03 - code is as much celebratory you know we
40:06 - don't want this to feel like
40:07 - standardized test taking and those types
40:10 - of processes in school should be at
40:12 - ninety percent fun and ten percent you
40:15 - know the prep time and that kind of
40:17 - stuff um so I I see a question here
40:21 - saying or not only question a comment
40:22 - saying that somebody asks their students
40:25 - to create accounts so that they could
40:26 - students could keep working after school
40:28 - they give them extra credit and monitor
40:30 - their progress outside of the classroom
40:31 - if you do want to monitor your students
40:33 - progress beyond the classroom that is a
40:35 - good reason to have accounts and again
40:38 - if you're going to do that at start by
40:39 - creating a teacher account and they're
40:41 - putting the students in from there if
40:43 - you're just doing it during the hour of
40:45 - code in your classroom it's easier not
40:46 - to bother with accounts what if we don't
40:49 - have any okay um what do I don't know
40:56 - these schools that teaches um how to
41:01 - code I don't have that way okay so in
41:03 - your community somebody say they don't
41:04 - have any schools that teach people how
41:05 - to code um I don't know if you're asking
41:07 - that because you're asking about
41:08 - volunteers are you asking you're just
41:10 - looking for how to run not sure where
41:14 - this question is going is it about
41:16 - heaven um the course is worth schools
41:19 - near body don't have computer science in
41:21 - general that's the problem we're trying
41:23 - to solve yeah you know we believe the
41:25 - solution for this isn't to have you know
41:28 - special coating schools or camps but to
41:30 - have regular school teach computer
41:32 - science as part of regular school
41:34 - curriculum and the best way to get that
41:37 - started for the school to at least try
41:39 - doing it for one hour at fit but Ron
41:42 - what I would suggest if you go to code
41:43 - org at if you you're gonna cook at work
41:47 - / promote you can also is what I make a
41:51 - note all of these links are in our
41:53 - showcase sidebar so you should see in
41:56 - your Google Hangouts there's a Q&A and
41:58 - there's a showcase and showcases were
42:00 - also we've been looking to think so you
42:02 - can use that to hop on
42:03 - directly but I knew at code.org /
42:05 - promote or if you sign the petition at
42:08 - code.org it will take you that paid to
42:10 - that page there's a letter that we
42:12 - recommend sending to your local school
42:13 - to ask your school to support computer
42:15 - science so if you don't know of schools
42:19 - in your area that that teaches your code
42:21 - if you go to where the hour of code
42:23 - tutorials are there's a bunch of tabs
42:25 - and it's one of those tabs is basically
42:27 - fine to local school and it offers a
42:29 - search for all the schools nearby
42:31 - oftentimes there are schools that you
42:32 - don't actually know about to offer a
42:35 - computer science uh and there was one I
42:39 - just just scrolled off so I was asking
42:40 - if you students don't have accounts and
42:42 - you're doing it over two days will their
42:44 - work be saved until they come back to
42:46 - the next day and this depends on a
42:50 - general note because i don't have
42:52 - accounts um but it depends on what
42:54 - tutorial you're using or which you know
42:57 - which on which site whether or not they
42:59 - can come back and start where they left
43:00 - off even though their progress wasn't
43:02 - saved so on our tutorials if you get to
43:05 - say there was a twenty puzzle
43:06 - progression and your student got through
43:08 - puzzle eight on day one they can come
43:10 - back and start on puzzle nine even
43:12 - though it didn't save all of their
43:14 - progress from puzzle eight if they
43:15 - remember their own puzzle nine they can
43:16 - come right back in a jump in a puzzle
43:18 - nine so you still even if you're doing
43:19 - that you still don't need to create
43:20 - accounts if you do want to create
43:22 - accounts it will obviously save their
43:24 - progress and they'll be able to start on
43:25 - puzzle line and see all of their
43:26 - progress up to puzzle ate some of the
43:28 - other tutorials also let you jump in
43:30 - wherever you're going a lot of them are
43:33 - in sequence so if you get halfway
43:34 - through um then you can't come in the
43:38 - next day and continue um but you know
43:40 - another thing to think about is if
43:41 - you're doing this for two days you can
43:43 - also do two different tutorials like the
43:45 - students don't need to continue where
43:46 - they left off they can also start you
43:47 - know a different tutorial the next day
43:49 - and get a different experience if that's
43:52 - simpler for you ah there's a question
43:56 - from Kimberly's as I who I actually
43:59 - answer that generally said my students
44:02 - all receive their own laptops us here
44:03 - can they keep going with these tutorials
44:05 - Thank You Kimberly first of all but of
44:08 - course they can you know the first year
44:10 - when we launched the hour of code the
44:12 - number one support question we got
44:14 - during the week
44:15 - was we'll all of this stuff still live a
44:17 - lot for the weekends and yeah you know
44:20 - we keep our tutorials around year-round
44:22 - and you know co dot orgs one our
44:24 - tutorials are extremely popular if you
44:26 - you know click a few links deeper into
44:29 - our side to go to code studio which is
44:31 - up there at Studio G org at there's
44:35 - hundred hours worth of tutorials and
44:38 - curriculum that you can use so we'd love
44:41 - for your students to go beyond just the
44:43 - first hour had whether they finish their
44:45 - math math lessons early or or what about
44:48 - so don't limit yourself just 21 our
44:50 - tutorials the tutorials at studio crows
44:53 - are earth are full on the horses for ten
44:56 - weeks or longer scroll down let's say
44:59 - some of the more questions fist um okay
45:05 - okay somebody there said my school
45:08 - district insists on tracking progress
45:10 - that's why we're selling it accounts I
45:12 - actually want to mention a point in this
45:14 - which is that we're not against you
45:15 - setting up student accounts or tracking
45:17 - progress we just want to make sure you
45:19 - don't feel like we're requiring it we
45:21 - allow the hour of code to happen without
45:23 - sign up to make it as easy as possible
45:24 - and we also support sign up to let you
45:27 - track progress but don't feel that code
45:29 - that org is insisting that you sign up
45:34 - okay so oh there's another question
45:37 - about signing up event somebody said
45:38 - they signed up their event as a special
45:39 - event but it doesn't show up on the map
45:41 - even though I received a confirmation
45:42 - letter is my event still registered so
45:45 - there's two to two questions we get a
45:48 - lot on that one of them I was talking
45:50 - about earlier which is people signed up
45:51 - their event but it's not showing up on
45:53 - the map that's because we have way more
45:56 - events this year that we were expecting
45:57 - and they can't I'll show up on the map
45:58 - so yes the bat broke the map rogue um
46:01 - but if you signed up and you got a
46:04 - confirmation letter yes we absolutely
46:05 - are doing your event or excited about it
46:06 - and it's counted in the total number of
46:08 - events which is close to 170,000 when i
46:11 - looked earlier today no what Oh broken
46:16 - droids okay we're both so 170,000 now
46:18 - crazy then a second questions about a
46:21 - special event so for the special events
46:24 - we wanted to highlight some exciting
46:25 - events around the world that are going
46:27 - on
46:27 - um we've had thousands and thousands of
46:30 - those as well we can't put them all on
46:32 - the map and still read the map so we
46:35 - we've got it we've registered it um we
46:38 - the ones that are showing up in orange
46:40 - we just look through them and picked
46:41 - some that we thought were exciting to
46:43 - highlight and we when I was not
46:44 - highlighting all of them but if you did
46:46 - submit and you're doing a special event
46:48 - we're excited about that we've got that
46:49 - registered so thank you for doing that
46:50 - um this is a great question wrong I'm
46:55 - between a teen it would really like to
46:58 - start a community of coding where teens
46:59 - can come and learn how to code any
47:01 - suggestions on how to start this kind of
47:03 - community I have two ideas of websites
47:06 - you can go to the basically give you
47:08 - ideas on this kind of thing one is coder
47:11 - dojo and the other is code club now
47:14 - neither those are designed for teens
47:16 - starting a community those are really
47:17 - designed for an adult who wants to start
47:19 - recoding community or a coding club when
47:22 - all the resources they talk about you
47:25 - know are relevant you know even if
47:27 - you're not an adult but the other thing
47:29 - I would say no matter what age you are
47:31 - is just get creative you know starting
47:34 - an immunity it's not like there's a rule
47:36 - book from how to start a community at
47:37 - and the best things just start with
47:39 - people coming up with our ideas and
47:41 - trying one thing and seeing what works
47:42 - you know everything we're doing at
47:44 - code.org we're not following a playbook
47:46 - that was given to us you know this whole
47:48 - thing started by just thinking that it
47:50 - would be great to do this at so get
47:52 - creative and come up with your own ideas
48:00 - Santino who's asking our website
48:03 - showcase any classrooms or schools that
48:05 - participate um the way we're going to be
48:07 - doing that is more on our social media
48:09 - rather than on our website at simply
48:11 - because we want to be able to highlight
48:13 - lots and lots of things and the time it
48:17 - takes to update the website at it will
48:19 - get in the way of the problem that
48:20 - somebody else asks about making sure the
48:22 - website is up throughout the leaf we
48:24 - don't want to mess with the website at
48:25 - all by the way if that's a the thing we
48:29 - took place it will update it will be on
48:30 - Twitter and on Facebook but yet I'm bej
48:32 - this before but the way to share that is
48:34 - to share if you could share about social
48:36 - media and
48:37 - hashtag hour of code then we will see it
48:40 - and we can we can share and be share and
48:43 - that's a great way for you also to share
48:45 - with all the other teachers out there so
48:47 - between a hashtag hour of code and then
48:50 - at mentioning code org those two things
48:53 - are the way that will see that it will
48:54 - be retweeting all the best things we see
49:02 - there's a question about planning an
49:04 - event in a library setting and how to
49:05 - promote it within your area and you want
49:08 - the this is Alan of its question mm and
49:11 - how do I get the maximum number of kids
49:13 - to show up at the thing I'd say mainly
49:17 - is get created in terms of the different
49:18 - avenues that are specific to where you
49:20 - live for sure you should use social
49:22 - media and then the next thing I would
49:24 - think about is how do you reach parents
49:26 - within your community whether that's at
49:29 - a grocery store or at a PTA at the local
49:32 - school or things like that at any of
49:34 - those are great options a great question
49:38 - about how to find more volunteers it
49:41 - looks like she's already committed to
49:42 - another school anyway to expand search
49:43 - volunteers outside the Decatur Georgia
49:45 - area yeah so again we have we have a lot
49:49 - of volunteers with thousands of allah
49:50 - tears right now still have not been
49:51 - contacted unfortunately they're not
49:54 - spread out geographically um they tend
49:57 - to be clustered so there are two things
49:59 - to do one is on the website you can
50:01 - increase the radius that you're looking
50:04 - for so on that website where we've got
50:06 - volunteers it defaults to I think ones
50:10 - with you know the five they're sort of
50:12 - closest to you but if you're not finding
50:13 - if they're not writing back or they're
50:15 - already busy just go ahead and expand it
50:17 - out look for 10 miles out 15 miles out
50:19 - and if there aren't any in your area
50:21 - there are a lot of volunteers who check
50:23 - the box saying the days yeah that they
50:25 - want to skype into a classroom or
50:27 - connect remotely they also might want it
50:30 - you know if you just need some help
50:31 - talking to somebody before the our code
50:33 - about anything technical that you're
50:34 - having questions about they might be
50:35 - able to help you with that too so I'd
50:38 - encourage you just to do a search in a
50:39 - different area you know do a search in
50:41 - um you know San Francisco for somebody
50:43 - Hill remote in to Georgia because
50:45 - there's a lot of people in San Francisco
50:46 - in the database right now so easy to
50:50 - answer
50:50 - looking for a system administration for
50:53 - moving kids from class to class that's
50:56 - another thing we're working on right now
50:57 - you can select it oh ok so another
51:00 - question we're getting is about moving
51:02 - kids from one class to another this is
51:05 - also something that you don't need to do
51:06 - for the hour of code but if you want to
51:09 - do it for you know because you're doing
51:11 - larger classes or because you're trying
51:13 - to like any of the reasons and bunch of
51:15 - reasons people were tracking data
51:16 - outside of class you have kids are in
51:18 - the class they're a couple different
51:19 - ways to do this one is uh you know if
51:23 - you're just if you don't need the data
51:25 - from the students from last year and we
51:27 - don't we don't keep a lot of data on the
51:28 - students it's just their progress on
51:29 - code studio so if you just want you know
51:32 - to enter them in a new class but you're
51:33 - doing a new class it's fine to let that
51:35 - data go and just enter copy and pasted a
51:37 - new set of names into the teacher set up
51:40 - for classroom and reset up your
51:42 - classroom for the next year if you do
51:44 - want to move the kids from one class to
51:45 - another um that is something we're
51:47 - working on making easier right now but
51:49 - right now you can do it by having the
51:50 - students enter the the course code for
51:53 - the new course at their entering and
51:55 - that will move them into that class um
51:57 - this is kind of a scary question me is
52:00 - saying my team team and I were all high
52:02 - school students will be hosting the
52:03 - event together in our community do we
52:05 - all get to thank you get sores or 14
52:06 - event and the unfortunate answer it is
52:09 - only one prevent and i also would say
52:11 - that's similar to the posters I'm a
52:13 - little bit worried about running out of
52:15 - the thank you gifts so you know whether
52:17 - it's microsoft for the windows codes
52:19 - apple with the itunes codes or amazon
52:21 - with their gift codes have all been very
52:23 - generous to give us a limited number of
52:25 - these to get out at and i think we
52:28 - already have more people signed up for
52:29 - events that we have gift codes to give
52:31 - out although not everybody actually
52:33 - expects to redeem them or get them at
52:36 - but they end up being one per classroom
52:39 - only and we are going to run out
52:42 - unfortunately yeah and in terms of I
52:45 - think your question was how does she
52:47 - redeem it after the hour of code will
52:49 - send out a survey that you can tell us
52:51 - about the hour of code and then after
52:54 - that we'll give you the information on
52:55 - how to redeem the gift code nadi asks is
52:58 - there something that's streaming online
52:59 - or via social media that people can see
53:02 - everybody across the full
53:03 - who's enjoying coding during the same
53:05 - hour and we're looking to see if we can
53:08 - set up something like that at not on our
53:10 - own websites just because we don't want
53:12 - with our own websites at and I'm not
53:16 - sure we'll have something if we do we'll
53:17 - send email about it literally Monday
53:19 - morning Toki protect chance yes there's
53:23 - two other things I would say just
53:24 - looking at the map on our code calm is
53:27 - pretty fun if you visit that map and
53:30 - then zoom in and then look around the
53:32 - entire country and then into the entire
53:34 - world the number of places are going to
53:37 - really weird places that are doing the
53:39 - hour of code is just a really fun thing
53:40 - to do and it's fun to do with students
53:43 - and that's how they'll see people that
53:45 - are doing this throughout the week
53:46 - rather than during the hour the second
53:48 - is we'll have a number of these
53:49 - celebrity tech chats you know people who
53:52 - are not necessarily celebrities but
53:53 - influentials like you know if you have
53:55 - teenagers that are into buzzfeed the
53:58 - head of data science for BuzzFeed who
54:00 - basically she actually went to college
54:01 - with me but she's a computer scientist
54:03 - and uses data analysis to decide what
54:06 - what headline story mode on BuzzFeed
54:08 - she's one person or the founder of
54:10 - Instagram Kevin Systrom if you know
54:12 - again kids love and ceramic they're
54:14 - going to be posting these tech chats
54:15 - with a handful of lucky classrooms would
54:18 - like this google hangout anybody who
54:20 - wants to can tune into those and that's
54:22 - another fun way to the classroom to feel
54:24 - like they're part of something overall
54:25 - there's also in that inspirational video
54:28 - list which I one of those behind me at
54:30 - the difference well add it to the list
54:33 - of homes yeah it's on you'll see the
54:35 - inspirational videos so one of those
54:37 - inspirational videos is sort of about
54:39 - the momentum of hour of code and shows
54:40 - people all over the world doing the hour
54:42 - of code and plain that as part of you
54:45 - know either the beginning or end our
54:46 - code is a great way to give your kids
54:47 - the sense that your students a sense
54:49 - that they're part of something broader
54:51 - and that it's all around the world all
54:53 - right Kate this question has been plus
54:54 - 13 times the Maoris in Norfolk recently
54:58 - yes we had a question can you do the
55:05 - hour of code before after computer
55:07 - science education week if you have exams
55:09 - that week um I know where the pressure
55:13 - is but absolutely at you know we we make
55:16 - it a
55:17 - you know we try to get people to choose
55:19 - computer science education week as the
55:21 - time to the hour of code just to get the
55:23 - sense of international participation in
55:25 - a huge movement but you know you can do
55:27 - the our code anytime you want in fact
55:30 - you know in the last year the last 12
55:34 - months there was roughly 40 million
55:35 - people who did the hour of code just
55:37 - during computer science education week
55:39 - and roughly another 40 million who did
55:41 - it throughout the entire school year
55:43 - since the end of December although until
55:46 - now so you know anytime is good to try
55:49 - computer science our real hope is after
55:51 - you try one hour of coding they go
55:53 - beyond that the goal of an hour of code
55:55 - isn't you know the kids are going to
55:56 - come computer scientists or software
55:59 - engineers in one hour you know it's not
56:02 - that they need to take a thousand hours
56:04 - or a whole you know lifetime of coding
56:06 - but you know a year-long computer
56:08 - science course is something that every
56:09 - student should have at least the option
56:11 - to learn and those of you who are in
56:13 - elementary school teachers or middle
56:14 - school teachers you can integrate a
56:15 - short 20 our horses or module and we
56:19 - offer many great 20 our courses for
56:21 - different age ranges and we highly
56:22 - recommend looking into offering those
56:24 - throughout the school year can things
56:29 - sure I have heard about inviting local
56:31 - politicians etc what success have you
56:34 - had with schools doing this what about
56:35 - media outlets um yeah absolutely we've
56:39 - had governor's we've had senators we've
56:41 - had mayor's we've had of everything from
56:44 - you know the local guy just in your
56:47 - district to the governor of the whole
56:48 - state we've had multiple this year who
56:50 - are going to going two hours of code I
56:53 - think it's something that a lot of
56:54 - politicians really enjoy doing um it's a
56:57 - great opportunity for them to to to show
57:01 - that they are you know into technology
57:04 - to students into the future but it's
57:06 - also a good opportunity for you to get
57:08 - them to see what it means for this for
57:10 - your state to support computer science
57:12 - and you don't know unless you ask so
57:15 - nice lately strong in this particular
57:17 - thing is capable of ask how does coder
57:19 - or have so many celebrities involved in
57:22 - it or so many politicians or have to get
57:23 - the President to to write a lot of
57:25 - javascript etc there is no rule book for
57:28 - this and there's no like special magic
57:30 - to get people to say yes it just has to
57:32 - do with asking and asking the right way
57:34 - and trying to find a way to sort of
57:36 - plang people's individual heartstrings
57:38 - so you know if you're doing an hour of
57:40 - code with your school especially if the
57:41 - whole school is doing it at arrange a
57:44 - student assembly and then send a look a
57:46 - note whether it's to a politician or to
57:49 - the head of a local business or
57:50 - something it is not a hard-ass task or
57:53 - politician to come speak at a school for
57:55 - something like this especially if you
57:56 - send a photo of the president or
57:58 - governors who have done it you know last
58:02 - year the Prime Minister that UK did it
58:04 - there's also many people who participate
58:06 - in this I think in general the average
58:08 - politician would love to engage look
58:10 - like this it'd just be brave and if you
58:12 - get a no answer go to the next
58:14 - politician that's plenty of politicians
58:16 - in terms of media I mean they reinforce
58:18 - each other right so if you can ask the
58:20 - media if they come probably makes the
58:21 - politician more likely to show up but
58:23 - it's the politicians they're the video
58:24 - is more likely to show up so I would
58:26 - just say go ahead and ask it doesn't
58:28 - hurt to ask and it's a lot of fun for
58:29 - the students if they can get somebody to
58:30 - show up like that so you know one thing
58:32 - to do would be you organize your bed and
58:34 - by the local volunteer to come that we
58:37 - have somebody to speak are you know plan
58:39 - to play a video plan a little you know
58:41 - assembly and if you can get the
58:42 - politician there that's great it's extra
58:44 - fun and if they're not there you still
58:45 - have a great time and it'll be great for
58:47 - your students but go for it and the link
58:49 - we wrote below the hashtag hour of code
58:51 - calm / promote that teacher to our
58:55 - promote and our resources page where we
58:56 - have sample letters you can send to
58:58 - politicians or media if you're not quite
59:00 - sure what to write ok I think we're
59:05 - short on remaining questions this
59:07 - seamlessly kind of i'll just say also
59:10 - with three minutes so yeah go ahead yeah
59:12 - ETF closing as I system closing words
59:14 - just for people to miss the initial
59:17 - words we said hey first of all thank you
59:19 - everybody for joining in this is going
59:21 - to be an amazing week next next week you
59:24 - know whether you have a good time or a
59:25 - great time please share how it goes on
59:28 - social media or in your neighborhood or
59:31 - community you know the strength of the
59:33 - hour of code comes from teachers
59:34 - educators deciding as a community that
59:37 - we want computer science to be something
59:38 - our children that our students get to
59:40 - participate in and that community grows
59:43 - when you
59:44 - read the word about it whether it's on
59:45 - Twitter Facebook or just a word of mouth
59:47 - at printing the certificates for the
59:50 - kids to take home for their parents to
59:52 - see is another huge deal and that that
59:55 - if you're not sure how to do that the
59:56 - lesson plans on the website talk about
59:58 - that and that maybe a URL with running
60:01 - co.org / certificates is how you print
60:04 - the certificates for the students to get
60:05 - home and I think we're together
60:07 - somewhere between 50 million and a
60:09 - hundred million students to do the hour
60:10 - of code in one week this this year which
60:13 - is amazing the low end of that 50
60:15 - million is the full student population
60:17 - of the United States at the high end of
60:19 - that is at the student population of the
60:22 - US and Europe combined somewhere between
60:24 - those two is the range of what we're
60:25 - going to hit which is just amazing and
60:28 - it's thanks to everybody in the educator
60:30 - community in the entire world that is
60:31 - participating this campaign and like if
60:34 - we've said before the goal of the hour
60:35 - of code is to have fun and for you
60:37 - yourself as educators and your students
60:39 - to gain the confidence that computer
60:41 - science as a field that any student can
60:43 - learn and to really go actually beyond
60:45 - the first hour to try ten hours or 20
60:48 - hours or even a full for you dear long
60:50 - course whether it's for your students to
60:52 - try it or for your school to teach it I
60:55 - think that's about it so thank you so
60:57 - much thank you good luck we're excited
60:59 - you doing this
