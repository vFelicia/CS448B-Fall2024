00:03 - in these lessons your students are going
00:05 - to apply their experience with encoding
00:07 - information they will start to build
00:09 - more complicated protocols to represent
00:11 - images in binary
00:13 - students will start with black and white
00:14 - images and develop their own protocols
00:16 - to communicate all the necessary data
00:18 - found in a black and white image and
00:20 - next students will make their protocols
00:22 - more robust so they can deal with
00:24 - encoding color images
00:27 - these lessons explore the overlap
00:28 - between the cs principles big ideas of
00:31 - abstraction data and creativity
00:34 - we will use a tool called the pixelation
00:36 - widget so students can apply and test
00:39 - out a protocol for encoding images
00:41 - you can learn more about that widget and
00:43 - how it works in the tutorial videos
00:45 - found in the csp unit 1 course on code
00:48 - studio
00:49 - digital images are stored in a computer
00:51 - as a series of pixel data which encodes
00:54 - how much light and what color should be
00:56 - used at various points in the image
00:58 - when the computer displays the image on
01:00 - a screen it uses that data to set the
01:02 - color and brightness of the tiny lights
01:04 - on screen which we then see as an image
01:07 - the light levels captured in the pixel
01:08 - data change depending on the color with
01:11 - the most basic color channels being 0
01:13 - and 1 for black and white and with the
01:15 - light levels getting more sophisticated
01:17 - as you add color
01:19 - the protocols that students develop will
01:21 - need to convey the pixel color data as
01:23 - well as the size of the image
01:25 - as the images start to include color
01:27 - your students might want to use
01:28 - hexadecimal representations of their
01:30 - color values you'll also learn more
01:33 - about hex in the tutorial videos found
01:35 - in the csp unit 1 course on code studio
01:38 - when using the pixelation widget your
01:40 - students will need to keep in mind how
01:42 - they're encoding the dimensions of the
01:44 - image as well as the data for the pixels
01:46 - since the pixel data is the piece that
01:48 - changes the colors in the image students
01:50 - are likely to get pretty caught up
01:52 - adjusting them
01:53 - don't forget that in order to get the
01:54 - image to look the way it's intended all
01:57 - of the bits will need to be encoded
01:58 - properly
01:59 - this means that changing the way colors
02:01 - are represented might require updating a
02:03 - significant amount of data in order for
02:05 - the image to look just right
02:07 - it's natural for your students to
02:09 - experiment while using the widgets and
02:10 - this is encouraged by playing around
02:12 - with different color representations
02:14 - students will build context and
02:15 - understanding around the numeric values
02:17 - of colors
02:19 - and while your students are
02:20 - experimenting with the widget it's
02:21 - important to ask questions to help them
02:23 - uncover the core concepts behind what
02:25 - they're seeing
02:26 - consider asking students questions like
02:29 - why does the image look weird when you
02:30 - change the bits per pixel without also
02:32 - updating the pixel information or how
02:35 - are black and white images different
02:36 - than color images
02:39 - how does the order that you put the
02:40 - image data into the pixelation widget
02:42 - matter
02:44 - what happens when you switch the color
02:46 - data with the size data
02:48 - reference your walk around card for the
02:50 - pixelation widget for more questions to
02:52 - ask and things to look out for while
02:54 - using the tool
