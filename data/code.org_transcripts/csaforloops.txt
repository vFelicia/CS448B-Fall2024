00:11 - let's explore how four loops help us
00:13 - save time repeating actions
00:15 - for loops are a specific type of loop
00:17 - that repeats a code segment a given
00:19 - number of times
00:20 - let's imagine we're programming a robot
00:23 - to put books on a shelf one at a time
00:25 - each shelf can only hold four books we
00:28 - want the robot to repeat the action of
00:30 - placing a single book on the shelf four
00:32 - times
00:33 - the header of a for loop contains all of
00:35 - the necessary information to set up and
00:37 - run the loop a set number of times
00:40 - four loop headers have three distinct
00:43 - parts a control variable
00:46 - a condition to decide when to stop the
00:48 - loop
00:48 - and how the control variable is changed
00:52 - for the control variable we create a
00:54 - variable called book and set it to a
00:56 - starting number
00:57 - next the condition the loop will
01:00 - continue as long as this condition is
01:02 - true
01:03 - in this case we will loop as long as
01:05 - book is less than or equal to four as
01:08 - soon as book reaches five the condition
01:10 - re-evaluates as false and the loop ends
01:13 - lastly we change the loop control
01:15 - variable so that the condition
01:17 - eventually becomes false
01:19 - for example increasing book by one
01:22 - on the first pass through the for loop
01:23 - book equals one on the second pass book
01:26 - equals two then book equals three and so
01:28 - on
01:30 - with loops we can access a specific
01:32 - element in an array using the loop
01:33 - control variable as the index
01:36 - for example if we put the robot's books
01:38 - into an array like this
01:41 - string
01:42 - robots books
01:44 - cs is awesome
01:46 - java is cool
01:47 - adventures in java lab
01:49 - my life as a software engineer
01:52 - then we can print this array using the
01:54 - loop control variable to start at the
01:56 - first book at index 0 and loop through
01:58 - the array until we get to the end like
02:00 - so
02:02 - let's get the names of the books that
02:04 - are in the robots books array
02:06 - we can do this by adding this statement
02:08 - inside of the loop
02:10 - now on each pass through the for loop
02:12 - the current book at position index is
02:15 - printed to the console
02:18 - we can use for loops to access and
02:20 - modify elements in an array the basic
02:23 - setup remains the same no matter what
02:25 - code we are running
