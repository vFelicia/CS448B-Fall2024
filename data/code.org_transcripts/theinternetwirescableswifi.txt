00:10 - My name is Tess Winlock. I'm a software
engineer at Google.
00:13 - Here's a question, how does a picture, text message or email gets sent from one place to another?
00:18 - It isn't magic. It's the Internet,
00:21 - a tangible physical system that was made to move information.
00:25 - The Internet is a lot like the postal service,
00:27 - but the physical stuff that gets sent is a little bit different.
00:30 - Instead of like boxes and envelopes the
Internet ships binary information.
00:36 - Information is made of bits.
00:38 - A bit can be described as any pair of opposites -
00:40 - "on" or "off".
00:42 - "Yes" or "no".
00:43 - We typically use a one meaning "on" or a zero meaning "off".
00:48 - Because a bit has two possible states, we call it binary code.
00:51 - Eight bits strung together makes one byte.
00:54 - 1000 bytes all together is a kilobyte.
00:57 - 1,000 kilobytes is a megabyte.
01:00 - A song is typically encoded using about three to four megabytes.
01:04 - It doesn't matter if it's a picture, a video
or a song
01:07 - everything on the Internet is represented and sent around as bits,
01:10 - These are the atoms of information!
01:12 - But it's not like we're physically sending
ones and zeros from one place to another,
01:16 - one person to another.
01:18 - So what is the physical stuff that actually gets sent over the wires and the airwaves?
01:22 - Well let's look at a small example here of how humans can physically communicate
01:26 - to send a single bit of information from one place to another.
01:29 - So say we could turn on a light for a 1 or off for 0.
01:33 - Or use beeps or similar sort of things
of like Morse code.
01:38 - These methods work but they're really slow, error-prone totally dependent upon humans .
01:42 - What we really need is a machine.
01:44 - So throughout history we've built many systems that can
01:47 - actually send this binary information through different types of physical mediums.
01:51 - Today we physically send bits by electricity, light and radio waves.
01:58 - To send a bit via electricity, imagine that
you have two light bulbs
02:02 - connected by a copper wire.
02:03 - If one device operator turns on the electricity then the light bulb lights up.
02:07 - No electricity, no light.
02:09 - If the operators on both ends agree that light on means one
02:12 - and light off means zero then we have a system for sending bits
02:16 - of information from one person to another using electricity.
02:20 - But we have a problem.
02:21 - Let's say that, y'know, we want
to send five zeros in a row.
02:24 - Well how can you do that in such a way that either person
02:27 - can actually count the number of zeros?
02:29 - Well the solution is to introduce a clock or a timer.
02:33 - The operators can agree that the sender will send one bit per second
02:36 - And the receiver will sit down and record every single second and see what's on the line.
02:40 - To send five zeros in a row you just turn off the light...
02:44 - wait five seconds...
02:45 - the person on the other end of the line will write down all five seconds
02:48 - say zero zero zero.
02:49 - And for ones do the opposite - turn on the light.
02:53 - Obviously we'd like to send things a little bit faster than one bit per second.
02:57 - So we need to increase our bandwidth:
02:58 - the maximum transmission
capacity of a device.
03:01 - Bandwidth is measured by bit rate,
03:03 - which is the number of bits that we can actually send over a given period of time,
03:07 - usually measured in seconds.
03:10 - A different measure of speed is the latency
03:12 - or the amount of time it takes for one bit to travel from one place to another,
03:18 - from the source to the requesting device.
03:21 - In our human analogy one bit per second was pretty fast
03:25 - but kind of hard for a human to keep up with.
03:27 - So let's say that you want to actually
download a 3 megabyte song
03:29 - in like three seconds.
03:31 - At 8 million bits per megabyte
03:33 - that means a bit rate of about 8 million bits per second.
03:37 - Obviously humans can't send or receive 8 million bits per second.
03:40 - But a machine can do that just fine.
03:42 - But now there's also a question of
03:43 - what sort of cable to send these messages over?
03:46 - And how far the signals can go.
03:48 - With an Ethernet wire, the kind that you find in your home or office or school,
03:51 - you see really measurable signal loss over just a few hundred feet.
03:58 - So if we really want this Internet thing to work over the entire world
04:01 - we need a different way of sending this information really long distances.
04:05 - I mean like across an ocean.
04:07 - So what else can we use?
04:08 - Well what do we know that moves a lot faster than just like electricity through a wire?
04:12 - Well... light!
04:15 - We can actually send bits as light beams from one place to another
04:17 - using a fiber optic cable.
04:19 - A fiber optic cable is a thread of glass engineered to reflect light.
04:23 - When you send a beam of light down the cable
04:25 - light bounces up and down the length of the cable until it is received on the other end.
04:29 - Depending on the bounce angle we can actually send multiple bits simultaneously,
04:33 - all of them traveling at the speed of light.
04:36 - So fiber is really, really fast.
04:38 - But more importantly the signal doesn't really degrade over long distances.
04:42 - This is how you can go hundreds of miles without signal loss.
04:45 - This is why we use fiber optic cables
across the ocean floors
04:49 - to connect one continent to another.
04:51 - In 2008 there was a cable that was actually cut near Alexandria, Egypt,
04:55 - which really interrupted the Internet for most of the Middle East and India.
04:59 - So we take this Internet thing for granted but
05:01 - it's really a pretty fragile physical system.
05:03 - Fiber is awesome but it's also really expensive and hard to work with.
05:07 - For most purposes you're gonna find copper cable.
05:11 - But how do we move things without wires?
05:13 - How do we send things wirelessly?
05:16 - Wireless bit sending machines typically use a radio signal
05:19 - to send bits from one place to another.
05:22 - The machines have to actually translate the ones and zeros
05:26 - into radio waves of different frequencies.
05:29 - The receiving machines reverse the process and convert it
05:31 - back into binary on your computer.
05:34 - So wireless has made our Internet mobile but a radio signal doesn't travel all that far
05:38 - before it completely gets garbled.
05:40 - This is why you can't really pick up a Los Angeles radio station in Chicago.
05:45 - As great as wireless is, today it
still relies on the wired internet.
05:48 - If you're in a coffee shop using Wi-Fi then
the bits get sent
05:51 - through this wireless router and then are transferred
05:54 - to the physical wire to travel the really long distances of the Internet.
05:58 - The physical method for sending bits may change in the future.
06:01 - Whether it's lasers sent between satellites or radio waves from balloons or drones.
06:05 - But the underlying binary representation of information and the protocols for sending that information
06:10 - and receiving that information have pretty much stayed the same.
06:13 - Everything on the Internet
06:15 - whether it's words, emails, images, cat
videos, puppy videos...
06:18 - all come down to these ones and zeros
06:20 - being delivered by electronic pulses, light beams, radio waves
06:24 - and you know lots and lots of love.
