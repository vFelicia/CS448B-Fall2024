00:06 - You already know 
how Sprite Lab can be used
00:09 - to put sprites on the screen
00:11 - and make them move 
or interact with the user.
00:14 - If you want your program to tell a story
00:17 - or give the user some instructions, 
you'll need to add text.
00:22 - Sprite Lab has a print block
that puts messages on the screen.
00:27 - Let's drag it out 
and type in something to show.
00:32 - Print blocks work great with event blocks,
00:35 - including the ones you've already learnt.
00:40 - To make your text more interactive,
00:43 - you'll need to understand 
a little bit about variables.
00:47 - A variable is a container like a box,
00:50 - except instead of storing objects,
00:53 - it can store information
like text or numbers.
00:58 - Just like a box, it's important to label 
the variable to know what's inside.
01:05 - To use the information
inside the variable,
01:08 - you'll need to remember 
the label you gave it.
01:11 - When a computer wants
to collect information it uses a prompt.
01:16 - In Sprite Lab, this prompt block
asks the user a question
01:22 - and stores whatever 
they type inside a variable.
01:26 - To use the information
from the prompt right away,
01:29 - drag out the "when answered" block.
01:33 - To show the information on the screen,
01:36 - connect the variable block
to the print block.
01:45 - You can also combine 
that information with other texts.
01:53 - Now your program
can ask the user a question
01:56 - and generate a personalized response.
02:03 - Adding text to your program
can make it more engaging.
02:07 - With variables, you can prompt 
the user for information,
02:11 - then store it for later.
02:13 - Programs that use variables can give us
02:15 - a more customized
and interactive experience.
