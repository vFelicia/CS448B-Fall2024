00:11 - The lesson we're doing right now
is called Conditionals with Cards
00:17 - So if you all can stay quiet for
20 seconds with no noises
00:26 - I will give you recess,
an extra 5 minutes of recess
00:32 - Go!
00:37 - ...
00:47 - Whoah, you did it!
00:50 - You guys re gonna get an extra
5 minutes of recess today!
00:56 - That is so neat.
00:58 - OK. So, I have a question for you
01:02 - I just said...
01:05 - "If (something)
01:11 - then (something else"
01:14 - Right?
01:15 - So what did I say?
01:17 - If...
Student: If you were quiet for 20 seconds...
01:20 - I'll give you an extra 5 minutes of recess
01:24 - If class is quiet
01:27 - Then I'll give you extra recess.
01:37 - If (something is true),
01:40 - then (something else will happen)
01:42 - "It's a reward, if you do something good,
you get a reward back!"
01:46 - "If you do something bad,
you get consequences"
01:48 - That was very good
01:50 - So did you hear that?
01:52 - Not only did she have an if,
01:55 - She said "(or else)".
01:57 - Has someone ever said:
01:59 - If ... or else ...
02:03 - Yeah? Do your parents do that?
02:06 - Class: yeah!
02:10 - Ok, so we have an "(else)"
02:15 - What was the "(else)"?
02:18 - If...
02:19 - The class is quiet, extra recess
02:22 - Else...
02:23 - Student: do we actually get extra recess?
02:26 - Yes, you actually get extra recess
Class: yay!
02:28 - There's no way I'd promise you that if you
don't get extra recess
02:32 - Student: if class is quiet they do
(get extra recess),
02:35 - if class is not quiet they don't get
extra recess.
02:38 - Teacher: no extra recess.
02:43 - And I could have said
02:45 - Or "(else)" you're going to clean up the
classroom. Right?
02:50 - Class boos
Teacher: there are lots of different things
I could have said
02:56 - This is called
02:58 - a conditional.
03:00 - Do you guys know what a condition is?
03:03 - So, have you ever heard,
maybe your parents, say:
03:07 - "I will on one condition, you pick up your
shoes right now."
03:13 - Right? Something like that?
03:15 - A condition is either something that happens,
or it doesn't.
03:20 - It's true, or it's false.
03:22 - So what we put in here
03:23 - is something that can either be "True",
or "False"
03:27 - So, when you guys were quiet for
20 seconds
03:31 - Was it
03:32 - True, or False?
03:33 - Class: True
03:35 - So we got to do this part (extra recess)
03:38 - Now if it were False
03:39 - and you weren't quiet?
03:41 - Then what would we have done?
03:44 - Student: the bottom part (no extra recess)
03:47 - Would we ever do both?
03:49 - Class: no!
03:50 - That doesn't make sense, right?
03:51 - Student: unless we're quiet for 10 seconds?
03:54 - Then we would do half and half
03:56 - Other student: but you talked.
04:00 - Teacher: so that's a compromise
04:02 - and that would have fallen somewhere
in the middle (between "if" and "else").
04:05 - So we could have done something like
04:09 - Else if (class kinda quiet)
04:24 - half extra recess
04:29 - and then
04:30 - we would've had the "else"
04:32 - that was "nothing extra".
04:40 - Right? So what you guys came up with is
these "if", "elseif", and "else" statements
04:49 - So you have one condition (the "if"),
04:51 - you have a whole separate condition that we
only care about if this one is "False"
05:01 - And then, if this one's "False"
05:04 - and this one's "False", then what do we do?
05:08 - We go to the "else" statement.
05:09 - And that captures everything else, ok?
05:13 - Ok, so now we are going to do an activity
05:18 - where you guys get to use that idea of
"if" and "else"
05:34 - Ok, so this first program here says
05:36 - If card is red, award your team one point,
05:42 - else, award other team one point.
Right?
05:48 - So, if you draw a red card, what happens?
05:54 - A lot of times teachers are so
used to hearing
05:56 - "(if... then...)"
05:57 - that "(if... else...)"
05:58 - sounds unnatural.
06:00 - If you remember that the "then" part is
06:02 - what you do when your condition is "true"
then it becomes a lot more comfortable
06:15 - So we were able to use those playing cards
to make "if" statements
06:21 - and play a game.
06:22 - And you had a game
06:24 - so that when if you drew a red card
you did one thing,
06:30 - otherwise you did something else.
06:32 - In computer science, we call that
a conditional,
06:36 - and it helps us make decisions
in our program.
06:39 - Because, is a computer as smart as we are?
06:42 - Class: no!
06:43 - Teacher: no,
06:43 - it's fast but they aren't very good
at making their own decisions
06:47 - unless you tell it what you want it 
to decide.
06:51 - So that's how we use a conditional
06:54 - so that the computer can figure out
what's gonna happen
06:58 - and run the program accordingly.
