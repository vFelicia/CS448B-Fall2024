00:03 - the hour of code is an hourlong
00:05 - introduction to computer science for all
00:07 - students no previous experience is
00:09 - required and the activities are designed
00:10 - to be self-guided empowering students to
00:13 - learn at their own pace this matters
00:15 - because the number of computing jobs in
00:17 - this country is rising three times
00:19 - faster than the number of computer
00:20 - science graduates we expect to have more
00:22 - than a dozen different 1our tutorials to
00:24 - choose from each introducing computer
00:27 - science in its own way for all students
00:29 - from K through 12
00:30 - for example we are expecting one
00:32 - tutorial to teach how to create an
00:34 - interactive card using the programming
00:35 - environment scratch our own tutorial
00:38 - will introduce some computer science
00:39 - principles through a series of puzzles
00:41 - that are fun to
00:43 - solve you can offer the hour of code on
00:45 - a range of devices including tablets PCS
00:48 - Macs and smartphones there will even be
00:51 - unplugged tutorials that can be
00:53 - completed without any computers at all
00:55 - the first thing you will need to figure
00:56 - out is where you will do your hour of
00:58 - code one option is to use a computer lab
01:01 - with internet connected PCS or Macs
01:03 - another option is to do the hour of code
01:05 - in your classroom using tablets or
01:06 - smartphones as long as they can access
01:08 - the internet students can also take
01:11 - turns doing the hour of code in your
01:12 - classroom using a shared Internet
01:14 - connected computer in fact we encourage
01:17 - students to do the hour of code together
01:18 - in pairs or small groups research shows
01:21 - that students retain more when they're
01:22 - programmed together the unplugged
01:25 - options can be done anywhere even
01:26 - Outdoors these activities are especially
01:29 - fun for group and really illustrate the
01:31 - point computational thinking does not
01:33 - require a computer we encourage you to
01:35 - try doing the selected tutorial yourself
01:37 - before your class does it so you can
01:39 - answer any questions that might come up
01:41 - finally it will be time for your
01:43 - students to do the hour of code
01:44 - themselves have them visit our website
01:46 - and choose the tutorial that you
01:48 - selected if you're doing an unplugged
01:50 - tutorial pass out the materials and
01:52 - explain the rules your students will
01:54 - enjoy doing the hour of code the
01:56 - tutorials are designed to be fun
01:58 - students who finish early can try a
02:00 - different perhaps more advanced tutorial
02:02 - or help other students and that's it as
02:05 - you've seen offering the hour of code to
02:06 - your students is easy it requires
02:08 - minimal prior preparation and no prior
02:11 - experience in just 1 hour you will have
02:13 - given your students an engaging and
02:15 - meaningful exposure to the world of
02:16 - computer science and help demystify what
02:19 - can be an intimidating subject to
02:24 - [Music]
02:28 - some
