00:06 - When you use a repeat block to loop your code,
how does the computer know when it's repeated
00:11 - enough times?
00:12 - The repeat block is actually hiding a more
sophisticated piece of code called a for loop
00:18 - which counts from a starting value up to an
ending value by a specific increment.
00:23 - For example, a repeat three block counts from
1 to 3 by 1.
00:30 - Every time it counts, it runs the code inside
the loop.
00:34 - The for loop knows how many times it has run
by using a counter variable which is set to
00:38 - the starting value at the beginning of the
loop and has the increment added to it each
00:42 - time the loop is run.
00:43 - As soon as the counter variable is greater
than the ending value, the loop stops running.
00:49 - The benefit of using a real for loop instead
of the repeat block is that you can actually
00:54 - see the counter variable and use it in your
loop.
00:57 - For example, if I have a series of flowers
and the first one has one nectar, the second
01:03 - one has two nectars and the third one has
three, I can use the for loop to tell the
01:08 - bee to collect 'counter' nectars each time,
which would one at the first flower, two at
01:14 - the second and three at the third.
01:17 - Also in a for loop, you can increment the
counter by a number other than one each time.
01:22 - You can potentially count by 2s, 4s or even
an amount that changes every time through.
