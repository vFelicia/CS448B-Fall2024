00:00 - hi everybody Welcome to the 2016 hour of
00:04 - code uh I don't see any classrooms in
00:07 - there I'm going to have Maddie from my
00:08 - team put a click in the in the chat room
00:11 - uh the chat window to say how you can
00:13 - join because I'd love to actually see
00:15 - the there's apparently 37 or 38
00:18 - classrooms all at once uh looking in on
00:21 - this on this broadcast but since I don't
00:22 - see you it kind of feels empty to me um
00:25 - but I'm just going to talk to to you
00:27 - know the classrooms out there
00:28 - you know there's welcome to the hour of
00:31 - code this is the second day of Computer
00:33 - Science Education week and the hour of
00:36 - code campaign is something that you know
00:39 - we launched just three years ago it's
00:42 - been amazing to see this campaign spread
00:45 - not just throughout the country but
00:46 - throughout the entire world uh in in
00:49 - just the last three years so today on
00:52 - the three year anniversary of the hour
00:53 - of code starting the the fourth year of
00:56 - the campaign we just announced that 300
00:58 - million hours of code have been done by
01:00 - students and students have have written
01:03 - 20 billion lines of code that's such an
01:07 - incredibly large number to you know to
01:08 - put it into context you know the average
01:10 - phone you know my phone has maybe 50
01:14 - million lines of code you know students
01:17 - across the world have written almost a
01:18 - thousand times as much code as it takes
01:21 - to create something like the Apple
01:22 - operating system or the Windows
01:24 - operating system
01:25 - I couldn't be more proud of what we've
01:27 - done with this campaign uh you know I
01:30 - started code.org because of this belief
01:32 - that every student in every school
01:34 - should have the the chance the
01:35 - opportunity to learn computer science
01:37 - well I started learning coding myself on
01:40 - my own when I was 12 years old and back
01:42 - when I started it wasn't nearly as fun
01:44 - it wasn't nearly as easy it wasn't
01:45 - nearly as accessible
01:47 - but I fell in love with it because when
01:49 - you write code when you do work creating
01:52 - technology
01:53 - you're not just solving problems you
01:55 - actually are creating things that are
01:56 - yours that you can share that you can
01:58 - show other people it's a lot like art
02:00 - it's a lot like creative writing it's a
02:02 - lot like music except because it's
02:04 - technology you can click a button and
02:06 - instantly have it spread to lots of
02:07 - other people
02:08 - and you know I've had a fantastic career
02:11 - personally in technology because of the
02:13 - the success I've had learning to code
02:16 - right now where we are in our current
02:18 - world is that the opportunity that I had
02:21 - is something that every student should
02:22 - have we live in a world where we all
02:25 - carry cell phones in our pockets every
02:28 - new car has tons of computers in it
02:30 - every industry is being changed by
02:32 - computer science that the community you
02:35 - know the communication we have via
02:36 - phones and telephones and whatnot are
02:38 - all being managed by computers are
02:40 - entertainment in movies and music videos
02:42 - and animations are all being created by
02:44 - computers agriculture is being planned
02:47 - using using computers uh banking
02:50 - Commerce
02:52 - manufacturing everything you see around
02:54 - us is being impacted by technology yet
02:57 - our schools don't teach even the basics
02:59 - of how this technology Works how to
03:02 - create it what's an algorithm what's
03:04 - inside an app how does the internet work
03:06 - what's cyber security about how does
03:09 - encryption work these are all topics
03:11 - that impact not just kids but adults and
03:15 - the impact every job and every type of
03:18 - field of study and so getting students
03:20 - and schools to learn computer science
03:22 - just like we learn English and math and
03:24 - reading and history is something that
03:27 - every school in the entire world should
03:28 - do
03:29 - with the hour of code you get the chance
03:32 - to spend at least one hour on coding and
03:34 - computer science to see what it's like
03:37 - and then you can decide from there do
03:39 - you want to go beyond one hour or not
03:40 - and
03:41 - you know code.org and hundreds of
03:43 - Partners have made this campaign
03:45 - work and spread throughout the entire
03:48 - world
03:53 - I want to see if I can get questions
03:54 - from the audience to to answer at
03:57 - night still I can't really actually see
03:59 - any of the folks out there but I would
04:02 - love to see if you have any questions
04:14 - all right well I have one question here
04:16 - uh and this is from
04:18 - Alice in uh
04:21 - in Idaho and she asks what's the best
04:25 - way to get my school district on board
04:26 - with the hour of code and with computer
04:28 - science Alice that's a great question uh
04:32 - you know
04:33 - the hour of code is really just the
04:34 - first step of adding computer science to
04:37 - a school's curriculum or to a school's
04:38 - program you know we don't have an hour
04:40 - of math we have math every day all week
04:43 - all year we don't just have an hour of
04:46 - English we don't just have an hour of
04:47 - science and computer science is just as
04:50 - important as some of these fields that
04:51 - needs to be integrated into the school
04:53 - system so you know what I'd recommend
04:55 - Alice is to to approach your school's
04:57 - Administration after the hour of code
04:58 - show them how much the the students and
05:01 - classrooms enjoyed it and asked them to
05:03 - make a computer science a priority
05:04 - within the school or the district and in
05:07 - fact if you go to the uh the code.org
05:09 - website and click the little button that
05:11 - says stats there's actually a letter
05:13 - there there's a template letter that you
05:14 - can send to any principal or
05:16 - administrator
05:18 - that tells you how to do that
05:26 - all right the
05:27 - next question uh says my kids love the
05:32 - hour of code
05:33 - but what's the best thing to do when
05:34 - they get stuck uh
05:37 - so
05:38 - um
05:39 - I'm assuming that's coming from a
05:40 - teacher who uh has to sort with how to
05:43 - how to add
05:45 - students deal with basically you know if
05:47 - you get stuck doing one of the hour of
05:48 - code tutorials the first thing I'd say
05:50 - is coding may start easy and fun it's
05:53 - not easy for anybody this isn't
05:55 - something that the adults learned when
05:58 - they were growing up any of the teachers
05:59 - in these classrooms weren't coders every
06:03 - teacher in America learned math and
06:05 - English when they were growing up when
06:07 - they were children almost none of them
06:09 - learned computer science or coding just
06:11 - because it's so new and it's not been
06:12 - available in school so if you're stuck
06:15 - it's not because
06:16 - you're dumb and you can't sort it out
06:18 - it's because you know learning computer
06:21 - programming involves making mistakes
06:23 - making bugs trying it different ways
06:25 - until you get it to work now if you try
06:27 - many different ways and you still can't
06:29 - get it to work the easiest thing to do
06:31 - is ask another student to show you how
06:32 - the only way to learn is from making
06:34 - mistakes and then and then having
06:36 - somebody walk you through it and what's
06:39 - fun about this is instead of asking just
06:41 - the teacher to show you you can also
06:42 - engage other students in doing this as
06:44 - well because you know when you when
06:46 - you're in math class and you make the
06:47 - mistake the teacher is usually the
06:49 - expert and that's who you go to when
06:51 - you're doing computer science if your
06:53 - teacher is new to it as well all of you
06:55 - are learning together and that's
06:55 - something you can Embrace and enjoy uh
06:58 - and you can just raise your hand and say
06:59 - I'm stuck here can anybody help me out
07:01 - uh you know don't be stuck quietly and
07:05 - I'm really serious about this because
07:07 - you might be in a one of these steps of
07:09 - one of these puzzles and you know you're
07:10 - not getting it right and you're not sure
07:12 - how and then you're just stuck there and
07:14 - sitting raise your hand and ask for help
07:16 - and ask the whole classroom hey does
07:17 - anybody figured out how to do number
07:18 - five and then everybody can help each
07:21 - other
07:21 - that's the best way to do it
07:25 - um
07:26 - there's a question from April de Janeiro
07:29 - saying uh
07:31 - what was your main inspiration for
07:33 - starting the hour of code
07:36 - this is a great question uh you know the
07:39 - idea for the hour of code
07:40 - is literally only three years old it's
07:42 - so amazing that this is a program that
07:44 - is that is now worldwide in entire
07:46 - countries uh but what happened is
07:49 - code.org had started as a very simple
07:51 - effort to get schools to think about uh
07:54 - adding computer science to their course
07:56 - to their courses in their schools and
07:59 - tens of thousands of teachers had
08:00 - reached out to us saying we'd love to do
08:02 - some kind of computer science in our
08:04 - school but every school is different
08:05 - there's elementary schools there's
08:07 - middle schools there's high schools some
08:09 - schools are ready to put a full course
08:11 - in their program some just want an
08:13 - after-school program so what I thought
08:14 - was what's the one thing that every
08:16 - school can do what's the one thing that
08:18 - every student could do that's funny
08:20 - enough and easy enough and the idea we
08:21 - thought is how about just one hour of
08:23 - computer science just to give it a shot
08:26 - and you know the goal of the hour of
08:28 - code isn't that everybody's going to
08:29 - become a coder in one hour and the
08:31 - reality is most of you aren't going to
08:33 - become coders when you grow up the real
08:35 - goal of the hour of code is for you to
08:36 - recognize this is what it's about and to
08:39 - realize that this is fun so that if if
08:41 - you like it you can go on into it and
08:42 - pursue it longer and I hope most of you
08:45 - enjoy it I hope most of you consider
08:47 - doing this much much longer than an hour
08:49 - because you know the real goal is for
08:51 - many of you to take 100 hours of
08:54 - computer science and learn just as much
08:55 - computer science as you'd learn a
08:58 - subject like science or history
09:02 - um
09:03 - the next question is from Elizabeth at
09:07 - people's Elementary in Peachtree City in
09:09 - Georgia
09:10 - uh
09:12 - so Elizabeth asks what would you say to
09:14 - help students persevere and I guess this
09:18 - is a little similar to the question
09:19 - about what you do when when you get
09:21 - stuck but you know the Great
09:24 - the great thing I'd say is that
09:26 - you know
09:27 - almost all kind of learning has ups and
09:30 - downs sometimes it's easy sometimes it's
09:32 - fun sometimes it's hard
09:35 - the the cool thing about writing code is
09:38 - that there's always a way to get it
09:39 - right but there's not just one right
09:41 - answer you know with math there's often
09:44 - problems where you know three plus three
09:47 - the answer is six and if you get it
09:48 - right you're right and if you get it
09:49 - wrong you're wrong
09:50 - when you're creating something using
09:52 - Code it's it's a little bit like math
09:55 - but it's a lot like art as well there's
09:56 - often multiple ways of doing the same
09:58 - thing because sometimes you're given a
10:00 - puzzle and there's five or six different
10:02 - ways you can solve it or you're just
10:04 - given something where it's not a puzzle
10:05 - you can just make whatever you want and
10:07 - you can make your own rules uh and so
10:10 - realizing that there's not only one
10:11 - right answer and you can make your own
10:13 - rules is one of the best ways to to get
10:15 - past sort of a problem when you're stuck
10:19 - um
10:20 - there's a question from students in
10:22 - Houston saying what's your favorite part
10:24 - about the hour of code
10:26 - my favorite part by far is
10:30 - hearing from students hearing from
10:31 - teachers
10:33 - seeing how much fun classrooms have with
10:35 - doing this and you know it's sometimes
10:38 - sometimes there's issues sometimes not
10:40 - everything works out perfectly but you
10:42 - know we make make it work
10:43 - but knowing that's
10:45 - literally worldwide this week tens of
10:48 - millions of students are all together
10:51 - participating in this campaign and
10:52 - coding all the same time not just using
10:55 - code.org tutorials by using fantastic
10:57 - tutorials from companies like like
10:59 - scratch like Tinker like the new Moana
11:02 - tutorial by Disney the new Minecraft
11:04 - tutorial by Microsoft there's so many
11:07 - different activities people are doing
11:08 - and just knowing how much the kids are
11:10 - enjoying it and seeing the looks on
11:11 - their faces interacting with students in
11:13 - schools is by far my favorite thing
11:17 - all right next question
11:20 - I have time for two more questions
11:27 - uh I have a there's a question from a
11:29 - teacher asking how we uh how we manage
11:32 - to get the prime minister of Canada to
11:33 - kick off this year's hour of code and
11:35 - what was that like uh
11:38 - so in case you didn't see it yesterday
11:39 - you know we we always try to do
11:42 - something special for the for the first
11:43 - day of launching of the hour of code so
11:45 - two years ago I had the Good Fortune of
11:47 - helping President Obama write his first
11:50 - line of JavaScript code using the Anna
11:52 - and Elsa Frozen tutorial
11:54 - today we uh or yesterday we were in
11:56 - Canada to kick off the international
11:58 - campaign uh from you know the prime
12:01 - ministers with the prime minister of
12:03 - Canada Justin Trudeau and two lucky
12:05 - classrooms in Ottawa it was snowing out
12:07 - there so it was you know it felt like
12:09 - Christmas uh and the prime minister of
12:11 - Canada said something really special
12:13 - this is a guy who he's currently you
12:15 - know the head of state he's like the
12:16 - president of the country but he used to
12:18 - be a he used to study Engineering in
12:20 - school so he said that he studied C plus
12:22 - plus programming when he was in college
12:24 - and he even done logo programming which
12:27 - is a lot like the
12:28 - Frozen artists tutorials that code.org
12:31 - has so he was very familiar with it and
12:33 - he was saying how you know even though
12:35 - he's running a country right now
12:37 - Having learned how to do code helps him
12:40 - take very big problems and break them
12:42 - into smaller pieces and also helps build
12:44 - the confidence that if you can tell a
12:46 - computer what to do you can build a
12:48 - system you can design things then you
12:50 - can design things to do anything and it
12:51 - helps build your own sort of
12:53 - problem-solving skills it was so
12:55 - fantastic to be able to kick off a
12:56 - campaign you know with the head of a
12:58 - country and he's one of the most popular
13:00 - prime ministers in the world
13:03 - um
13:05 - there's two more questions there's one
13:07 - student saying what coding language
13:08 - should I learn I'm guessing this is a
13:11 - high school student because when you're
13:12 - in elementary school and even an early
13:14 - middle school all the coding is in drag
13:16 - and drop platforms like code.org or like
13:18 - Tinker or like scratch once you reach
13:21 - high school but once you're older
13:22 - there's so many different computer
13:24 - programming languages
13:26 - but the thing I'd say is computer
13:28 - languages are not like spoken languages
13:32 - if you want to learn French there's 10
13:34 - 000 words to memorize everything has a
13:37 - different word every object every verb
13:40 - everything is different if you want to
13:42 - learn a different coding language
13:43 - there's only about a hundred maybe 200
13:46 - words to recognize and they all use the
13:48 - same grammar so it's always the ordering
13:51 - of things is the same how do you do a
13:53 - repeat Loop in one language okay you
13:55 - need to learn you know sometimes it uses
13:58 - semicolons sometimes are used as
14:00 - parentheses that part is different but
14:02 - it's still maybe 100 or 200 words and
14:04 - they're very similar so any language you
14:06 - start with you can learn a different
14:08 - computer programming language and maybe
14:09 - two three weeks once you get good at one
14:11 - you can get go to the next one so pick
14:13 - whichever one you want the language that
14:15 - code.org recommends people start with is
14:17 - Javascript but there's many other
14:19 - languages it depends on really what you
14:21 - want to build
14:22 - so if you want to build an IOS app for
14:24 - for your iPhone you would need to learn
14:26 - the Swift language if you want to build
14:28 - a Android app for a different phone
14:30 - you'd want to use the the Java
14:33 - programming language if you want to
14:35 - build a website there's a different
14:36 - language for that so you can start on
14:38 - any one of them and then learn the next
14:40 - one
14:40 - um
14:42 - the last question from Maura is what is
14:45 - next for code.org after the hour of code
14:48 - and this is a great question to close on
14:51 - at you know the goal of the hour of code
14:53 - isn't for every student to learn for
14:56 - just one hour
14:57 - goal and the goal of all the
14:59 - organizations and all the teachers who
15:00 - are participating in this is for
15:02 - students to be prepared for 21st century
15:04 - that it's being changed in by technology
15:08 - in ways that we can't even predict
15:09 - technology is moving much faster than
15:11 - any of us have been prepared for so so
15:13 - the goal of the hour of code and the
15:15 - goal of code.org is to change the entire
15:17 - school system to teach computer science
15:19 - just like we teach Math Science History
15:22 - foreign languages and the Arts
15:25 - and so what happens for us behind it's
15:28 - the hour of code and Beyond the hour of
15:29 - code is to work with schools and
15:31 - especially with teachers to teach
15:33 - multiple hours of code as full year
15:36 - school year long courses just like math
15:39 - class just like history class just like
15:41 - biology class and so for every one of
15:43 - you doing the hour of code today as if
15:46 - you're teachers if you enjoy it I
15:48 - encourage you to go on and if you visit
15:49 - code.org or visit the hour of code
15:51 - website there's buttons and links for
15:53 - how to go beyond an hour of code don't
15:55 - stop at one hour if you enjoy it whether
15:57 - alone as a student or with your
15:59 - classroom go go and go beyond that and
16:02 - ask your school to teach full computer
16:04 - science
16:05 - um
16:06 - I'm out of time and I want to let you
16:07 - all get back to your actual coding so I
16:10 - just want to say thank you so much to
16:12 - all the teachers and to all the students
16:14 - for participating in this year's hour of
16:15 - code it's so incredible to be part of
16:18 - creating something that has reached
16:20 - literally 300 million hours of code have
16:22 - been done by at least one out of 10
16:24 - students on the entire planet
16:27 - so each one of you in your classrooms if
16:29 - you look around there's 300 000
16:32 - classrooms just like that kids on every
16:34 - country in the plan on the planet from
16:37 - Russia to Bangladesh from Armenia to
16:41 - Japan from Argentina to Zimbabwe
16:44 - everywhere in refugee camps even you
16:47 - know everywhere students are doing the
16:49 - hour of code it's so cool to be part of
16:51 - something that's Global in this way I
16:54 - hope you have a great time thank you so
16:56 - much and enjoy your coding bye-bye
