00:08 - Congratulations,
00:09 - you've just learned 
the basics of computer science.
00:13 - Now you can use Sprite Lab to create
whatever you want.
00:18 - You'll see a button that says costumes.
00:22 - When you click on it, you can choose
00:24 - new Sprite costumes from a library.
00:29 - You can also draw your own.
00:36 - Once you have a costume
00:38 - you like, go back to your code.
00:41 - Now select that costume for your Sprite.
00:46 - If you look in the tool box,
00:48 - you'll find some brand new blocks
that you haven't seen before.
00:52 - For example,
there are lots of behavior blocks
00:56 - that will allow you to get your sprite
moving in fun and interesting ways.
01:02 - You can use the
when touches event block to control
01:06 - what happens when two sprites
bump into each other.
01:12 - Look for the create effect block,
01:16 - this powerful block can be used to make
a whole bunch of sprites that burst
01:23 - or pop
01:26 - or rain on command.
01:30 - Have a look around and try experimenting
01:32 - with these new blocks and features.
At the end of the tutorial
01:36 - click the share button to share a link
to your creation with your friends.
01:43 - You have all the powerful skills
you need to start
01:46 - developing apps, games
and other new programs in Sprite Lab.
01:51 - Use your new powers for good.
01:53 - Be kind and respectful.
01:55 - Just like you would
01:56 - if you were creating something on paper
or talking with a friend.
02:00 - So what will you create?
02:04 - You could tell a story about yourself
02:07 - or make one up
02:09 - with your own special characters.
02:14 - Maybe you'll even use your new computer
02:17 - science skills for your next school 
project.
02:22 - Stretch your imagination and have fun.
