00:10 - hi i'm sharanya i'm a software
00:12 - development engineer at aws iot iot is
00:15 - internet of things as the name says it's
00:17 - a network of things where things can
00:19 - communicate with each other without
00:21 - human interaction
00:24 - what if we wanted a simple way to
00:26 - traverse a two-dimensional array
00:28 - an enhanced for loop allows us to go
00:30 - through the entire data structure
00:31 - quickly
00:34 - we've already used enhanced for loops
00:36 - with one dimensional areas to iterate
00:38 - through a list of values
00:40 - since 2d arrays are stored as areas of
00:43 - arrays using enhanced for loops is
00:45 - similar to one-dimensional areas
00:47 - we just need two loops
00:50 - let's look at an example using a seating
00:52 - chart from a classroom
00:55 - the outer loop represents traversing
00:57 - each row of the 2d array
01:00 - since each row is an array itself
01:03 - we need to make sure we have the correct
01:05 - data type in our enhanced for loop
01:08 - that's why we define row as an error of
01:10 - strings which moves through each row of
01:13 - our 2d seeding chat
01:16 - the inner loop represents traversing
01:18 - each student in our row
01:20 - it needs to use the same data type as
01:22 - our outer array and it needs to traverse
01:25 - through the same variable we used in our
01:27 - outer array
01:29 - this loop uses a student variable to
01:31 - traverse each student in our row as the
01:33 - loop runs it moves through each element
01:36 - of the array
01:40 - let's add some print statements to our
01:42 - loop and see what gets printed
01:44 - we'll add a print statement inside both
01:46 - loops to print each student
01:49 - and we'll add a print statement outside
01:51 - of the first loop to add a new line
01:53 - between each row
01:57 - as the loop runs our outer loop moves
02:00 - through each row of our 2d array
02:03 - and the inner loop moves through each
02:05 - element in the row
02:07 - and each student gets printed to the
02:09 - console
02:11 - enhanced rule loops are a quick and easy
02:13 - way to access every item in a 2d array
02:16 - for instance things like printing or
02:18 - searching
02:19 - but remember we should not use it when
02:21 - we need to find an index modify values
02:24 - or loop through only part of a list
02:28 - for those situations we should just
02:30 - stick with the standard for loop
