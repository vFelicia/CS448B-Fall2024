00:39 - you'll also need to give your library a
00:40 - description
00:42 - all right functions to manipulate lists
00:46 - under functions you can select all or
00:48 - just select certain functions
00:51 - i'm going to select them all
00:54 - you'll notice my multiply by function
00:56 - doesn't have a comment so i can't add it
00:59 - so make sure you give all of your
01:01 - functions comments first

01:06 - you can copy this id to share with
01:08 - anyone else or share with specific
01:10 - people but i'm also going to show you
