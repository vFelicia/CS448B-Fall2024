00:01 - Preston: I'm not trying to brag, but I'm pretty
good at parkour.
00:04 - Lizzy: Let's sleep so it's day when Stacy
comes back.
00:08 - Stacy: Ok guys, I am back from the Minecraft
offices, and I think I know how to solve the
00:14 - problem I'm having in my game.
00:16 - I think I can use a function.
00:17 - Let me just open this.
00:20 - So a function is a specific set of instructions
to accomplish a certain task, kind of like
00:27 - a recipe.
00:28 - In the next few levels, you'll have access
to functions that you can use to solve the
00:32 - puzzles.
00:33 - Look at the code in the function when it's
in the workspace to see what it does.
00:36 - Then, find the block with that name in the
toolbox and drag it from the toolbox to the
00:41 - "when run" block.
00:42 - Remember, you can use the same function every
time you need to run the same set of instructions
00:47 - to do something, like build a bridge.
00:49 - Good luck, I know you can do it!
