00:00 - hello everyone uh welcome to our hour of
00:04 - code live for africa code week we have a
00:07 - great session for you today and to get
00:09 - started i want to introduce my co-host
00:12 - adi
00:18 - is a team manager at sap ireland and
00:21 - works on africa code week passionate
00:24 - about ed tech creativity and innovation
00:27 - adi is the co-founder is the founder of
00:30 - code arena an ngo working to promote and
00:33 - strengthen coding and stem skills
00:36 - acquisition among african students and
00:38 - teachers
00:39 - he is involved in several stem coding
00:42 - initiatives such as eu code week coder
00:45 - dojo and first lego league and he holds
00:49 - a master's degree in computer science
00:51 - welcome audi
00:53 - thank you so much caroline for having me
00:56 - great are you
00:59 - very nice to be here today
01:01 - that's great it looks like this is going
01:03 - to be an exciting session
01:06 - yes very excited about our guests we
01:08 - have today
01:10 - um
01:11 - so let's get started we have two great
01:13 - guests nancy sumari and stella uzojubu
01:17 - here
01:18 - uh we're going to take some time to chat
01:20 - with each of them and demo dance party
01:22 - and ai for oceans
01:24 - but before we
01:26 - uh introduce them let's share why we're
01:29 - here today the hour of code in africa
01:32 - code week initiatives
01:34 - for those that haven't tried an hour of
01:36 - code before the hour of code started as
01:39 - a one hour introduction to computer
01:41 - science to show that anyone can learn
01:44 - it is now a worldwide effort to
01:45 - celebrate cs starting with one hour
01:48 - coding activities but expanding to all
01:50 - sorts of community efforts
01:52 - we have tutorials in over 45 languages
01:55 - and this grassroots campaign is
01:57 - supported by over 400 partners and 200
02:00 - 000 educators worldwide we like to say
02:03 - that you can do an hour of code anytime
02:06 - whether it's during computer science
02:07 - education week africa code week or any
02:11 - other time of the year
02:12 - so adi and i have been working together
02:14 - the past couple of years on these
02:16 - initiatives and with that i'd like to
02:18 - pass it over to adi to talk about
02:21 - foot week
02:22 - thank you so much for online
02:24 - so for those of you who don't know what
02:26 - africa code week is
02:28 - africa public is the biggest digital
02:31 - literacy initiative on the continent of
02:33 - africa
02:34 - it focuses on sdg4
02:37 - which is providing quality education to
02:40 - the youth in africa
02:42 - and we also focus on sdg 17 we support
02:45 - that
02:46 - because we believe in partnerships
02:48 - it will take the collaborative wheel of
02:51 - all of us
02:53 - playing in the sector
02:55 - in the private sector the thought sector
02:59 - and the
03:00 - public sector to do the right you know
03:03 - to make education
03:05 - uh to bring quality education to the
03:06 - youth of africa
03:08 - so we're working on the program in
03:10 - partnership with the likes of unesco
03:12 - irish aid idea
03:13 - and so many other
03:15 - uh you know
03:17 - code dog and so many other fantastic
03:20 - organizations
03:21 - so it's a program that builds capacity
03:24 - for teachers
03:26 - and young learners across africa
03:28 - we teach them coding
03:30 - and it's not because we think every
03:31 - child will become a coda when they grow
03:34 - up
03:35 - it's not because we believe that every
03:37 - child will become a doctor
03:39 - or uh
03:40 - or walk in the stem one of the stem
03:42 - careers
03:43 - it's because we believe that
03:46 - the skill set and competencies that they
03:49 - gain
03:50 - learning how to code will stay with them
03:52 - for the rest of their lives
03:54 - lifelong learning skills
03:56 - so uh the program started in 2015
04:01 - and uh
04:03 - we scaled to 54 countries in 2015 we
04:06 - only started in south africa and morocco
04:09 - and a few other countries and in 2000
04:12 - uh
04:13 - 2000 last year
04:15 - we scaled to 54 countries
04:17 - meaning uh the pandemic provided us
04:20 - with challenges as well as opportunity
04:23 - to scale this to a wider audience
04:26 - because now we could take this virtual
04:29 - so to date we've been able to empower
04:32 - over 9 million youth
04:34 - across africa
04:37 - and we've been able to empower over 50
04:39 - 000 teachers
04:41 - just think about it in the sense of
04:43 - the multiplier effect of training 50 000
04:46 - teachers
04:48 - how many kids will pass through those
04:49 - teachers
04:50 - for as long as they continue to work as
04:52 - teachers
04:53 - so this is our sustainable
04:55 - sustainability plan to make this very
04:57 - sustainable for
04:59 - uh for the learners across africa
05:02 - and what's interesting is that 47
05:05 - of the beneficiaries of africa code week
05:08 - are girls
05:10 - and female teachers
05:12 - because we also focus on
05:14 - gender inclusion
05:17 - so uh some of the comp we have different
05:20 - components of africa code week
05:22 - we have the african code challenge which
05:24 - is the biggest
05:26 - coding competition on the continent of
05:28 - africa which we run once in a year
05:31 - it's an opportunity for us for the
05:34 - beneficiaries of the program
05:37 - to show us learning outcomes
05:40 - what have you been able to realize
05:42 - what have you been able to learn and
05:43 - master in the past 56 years that we've
05:46 - been running the program
05:48 - so uh african code challenge
05:51 - is out there for every child
05:54 - every young learner to participate in
05:56 - across africa we also have the women
05:58 - empowerment program
06:00 - as the name suggests it's a program for
06:02 - women teachers
06:04 - to
06:05 - build leadership skills classroom
06:07 - facilitation skills
06:09 - even entrepreneurship skills and all
06:12 - those skills that would they could
06:14 - cascade to students or young people that
06:16 - they teach
06:17 - that would help shape their life and
06:19 - prepare them for the future of work
06:22 - so
06:23 - the final one is last year
06:25 - we created an app
06:27 - because we realized that movable
06:29 - penetration in africa is huge
06:32 - and we wanted to tap into the
06:33 - opportunity for young learners to be
06:36 - able to
06:37 - access our resources
06:39 - on any device
06:40 - on demand
06:42 - anywhere at any time online offline
06:45 - so we have a lot of um unplugged
06:49 - activities in fact we have some of the
06:51 - some of our uh code
06:54 - uh resources on the app as well
06:56 - so for those of you who don't know
06:58 - already that there's an app out there
07:00 - for you to
07:01 - download and learn how to code
07:04 - you can search on the app store
07:07 - the google play store to you to download
07:09 - it so to follow the journey of africa
07:11 - code week
07:13 - follow us on our twitter page africa
07:15 - code week at africa
07:17 - and uh our website is
07:20 - www.africa.org
07:23 - and uh we're on instagram we're live on
07:26 - on the social year on social media
07:29 - thank you so much i hope i haven't
07:31 - talked too much
07:33 - no that was great always love to hear
07:35 - about africa cooking
07:38 - thanks adi uh now i'd like to introduce
07:41 - our first guest nancy sumari
07:44 - nancy is sumari is a published author
07:47 - businesswoman and award-winning social
07:50 - entrepreneur from tanzania
07:52 - nancy is the founder of the jenga hub
07:55 - the jenga hub is a maker space and
07:57 - learning lab whose vision is to
07:59 - reimagine learning to build a community
08:02 - of children and youth leveraging
08:04 - technology to create value and transform
08:06 - lives
08:07 - the hub's main purpose is to empower
08:09 - children to learn through crafting more
08:12 - wholesome learning experiences through
08:14 - technology and applying design thinking
08:18 - the hub's goal is to see children thrive
08:20 - creatively to become better learners and
08:23 - thinkers
08:24 - she is contributing to breed a new
08:26 - generation of responsible committed and
08:29 - digitally empowered citizens
08:31 - welcome nancy thanks so much for joining
08:33 - us today
08:35 - thank you so much for having me caroline
08:37 - happy to be here
08:39 - so great
08:40 - uh audi i believe you have some
08:41 - questions for nancy
08:43 - yes i do have some questions for nancy
08:46 - i'm nice that's very nice seeing you
08:48 - here today
08:49 - uh so i have a couple of questions um
08:52 - and you know it's just to get a sense of
08:54 - what you're doing and how you're doing
08:55 - what you're doing
08:57 - and the impact that you're making so my
08:58 - first question is
09:00 - how did you begin to get involved with
09:02 - computer science
09:04 - um well that's a very good question so
09:07 - when the genga hub was established we
09:10 - wanted to really think about
09:12 - how we mitigate the challenges that are
09:15 - in education systems across africa today
09:18 - teacher-student ratios are
09:22 - very much numbers that uh
09:25 - really to be honest are one of the
09:26 - biggest challenges lack of resources
09:29 - infrastructure problems and we quickly
09:31 - realized that one of the ways that we
09:33 - wanted to or one of the tools that was
09:36 - going to be very sustainable was
09:38 - technology and ways in which we might be
09:40 - able to empower the children and the
09:42 - teachers and various stakeholders in
09:44 - education to make sure that we're
09:45 - mitigating some if not all of these
09:48 - challenges that that are being faced
09:50 - today and so we quickly started to
09:53 - establish school clubs uh where we would
09:56 - train teachers and empower them with
09:58 - digital literacy skills and then through
10:00 - them um they empower they further
10:03 - empower the children within the primary
10:05 - school settings
10:06 - and then we've slowly grown that
10:08 - footprint into secondary schools as well
10:11 - and working very closely with community
10:13 - centers
10:15 - across tanzania to see ways in which we
10:17 - might also be able to use technology and
10:20 - digital literacy
10:21 - as uh the tool that will will ensure and
10:25 - empower children um and ensure access to
10:28 - the right content and educational
10:30 - materials that will allow them to
10:32 - participate fully in the development
10:34 - agenda
10:35 - that's very interesting so
10:37 - something very interesting you mentioned
10:39 - there is the poverty of
10:41 - infrastructure
10:43 - so
10:44 - that became even more evident last year
10:46 - because of the pandemic
10:48 - so the past couple of years have been
10:50 - particularly very difficult for
10:51 - education
10:52 - more so even made more complex uh last
10:54 - year as i said how has your work changed
10:57 - with a pandemic
10:59 - and how are you bridging so two
11:01 - questions in one how are you bridging
11:03 - uh that
11:04 - are you solving that problem of poverty
11:07 - of infrastructure
11:09 - uh i think it had one of the things that
11:11 - continued to be highlighted among the
11:14 - challenges was the issue of access and
11:17 - it's access outside of the normal school
11:19 - setting that we are used to and so i
11:21 - like what you said about mobile mobile
11:23 - phone penetration and that's how we
11:25 - essentially pivoted we were we quickly
11:28 - very assembled the teachers that we had
11:31 - trained across the years
11:33 - and then wanted to make sure that we're
11:35 - depositing resources um and curriculums
11:39 - in these feature phones
11:41 - offline and offline available on demand
11:43 - and so on and so worked very very
11:45 - closely with different community members
11:47 - including parents who really rose up to
11:49 - the challenge to ensure that no child
11:52 - was left behind so i think even though
11:55 - it highlighted the issues around access
11:57 - but it also reiterated the importance of
12:00 - empowering stakeholders various
12:01 - stakeholders within the education system
12:03 - so when we're talking about children and
12:05 - empowering them with technology how are
12:07 - we also ensuring that people who are
12:10 - facilitating learning are also empowered
12:13 - enough
12:14 - such that in the cases of pandemics or
12:17 - any other challenges that might
12:19 - force us to rethink education we're
12:21 - really rising up to that challenge with
12:23 - various stakeholders so i'm very glad
12:27 - that
12:28 - our parents and our teachers really were
12:30 - very instrumental in making sure that in
12:33 - any case and in in various forms
12:36 - various children accessing uh materials
12:39 - uh to ensure continued learning
12:42 - thank you so much
12:43 - uh so my next question is
12:45 - why why do you think it's very important
12:48 - for
12:49 - young learners young african learners to
12:51 - embrace or learn computer science
12:55 - well first of all i think
12:57 - because africa is such a young continent
13:00 - the bulk of our population is young
13:02 - people
13:03 - we should be able to empower them with
13:06 - skills of the future
13:08 - we have a lot of challenges in our
13:10 - continent but also there is a lot of
13:13 - opportunity right and i think technology
13:15 - gives us that power and that mandate to
13:17 - be able to solve problems within our
13:20 - context in our own way
13:22 - using these tools
13:24 - there are various fantastic innovations
13:26 - that are coming out of the continent um
13:28 - there are very many technology solutions
13:30 - that are very contextual to us and
13:33 - they're solving our problems in a way
13:34 - that we really didn't imagine before and
13:37 - we have technology to thank for that and
13:39 - more than technology to thank for is
13:41 - computer science and digital literacy
13:43 - skills so i think it's really really
13:45 - important to really
13:48 - ensure that all of our young people are
13:50 - getting these skills so that they may be
13:52 - able to translate it in a way that is
13:54 - meaningful to themselves and to their
13:57 - community as well
13:59 - yeah very very interesting here i i hear
14:02 - you loud and clear uh the skill set that
14:05 - they need to
14:06 - to learn now that will prepare them for
14:08 - the future work and even for the world
14:10 - of entrepreneurship so
14:12 - it's uh it's very essential to start
14:14 - together
14:16 - right from now
14:17 - um so what initiatives do the gender of
14:22 - as an organization
14:24 - carry out to support or to
14:27 - provide young learners opportunity to
14:30 - learn computer science about computer
14:31 - science
14:32 - well like i mentioned before we've
14:34 - established code clubs with our partner
14:36 - schools we train a lot of teachers and
14:39 - parents as well with coding skills and
14:42 - computer science skills so that they may
14:44 - be able to carry out this
14:46 - this learning beyond the classroom but
14:49 - one of the other things is that we we
14:51 - want to translate and contextualize
14:53 - coding curriculums in various languages
14:56 - that can be able to be accessible to
14:58 - children across tanzania we're a very
15:01 - diverse country and we want to make sure
15:03 - that this material is being accessed
15:06 - in a language that is friendly um but in
15:09 - also avenues that are very that that are
15:12 - very friendly as well um yeah so we we
15:15 - obviously uh admire the work that africa
15:18 - code week does and code.org as well and
15:21 - that's why we're very happy to continue
15:23 - to learn from you and continue to use uh
15:25 - whatever resources that um
15:27 - that are available to us to also ensure
15:29 - that we're doing our bit uh to empower
15:32 - our communities in tanzania
15:34 - thank you so much nancy for all the
15:36 - great work that you're doing out there
15:37 - so bring us uh bring caroline back to
15:40 - see maybe caroline has one or two
15:42 - questions for you also
15:44 - yes um nancy i wanted to see if you are
15:47 - ready to explore dance party together
15:50 - of course it's a one of our users
15:52 - favorite uh
15:55 - favorite challenge to do on on hour of
15:57 - codencode.org
15:59 - great yes it's definitely one of our
16:01 - favorites at code.org as well
16:04 - um
16:05 - so before we get started in the tutorial
16:08 - i want to talk about the concept of
16:10 - events
16:11 - an event is
16:12 - um an event tells your program to listen
16:15 - for something to happen and then react
16:18 - right away
16:19 - i'm wondering if you think we can create
16:21 - a program with events just the two of us
16:26 - let's try it
16:28 - um
16:29 - so if we paired a letter with a move
16:32 - then that would be an event so i've gone
16:34 - ahead and matched a b and c with three
16:37 - different moves
16:38 - a will be a clap
16:40 - b will be a point move
16:43 - and c will be an arm wave
16:46 - so for example when you say b i will do
16:49 - a point move
16:51 - how does that sound
16:54 - great um so why don't you go ahead and
16:58 - verbally say a mix of a b and c's and i
17:02 - will react all right c
17:08 - a
17:11 - and b
17:16 - that's great
17:17 - um
17:18 - so that was an event we just created
17:21 - that
17:22 - um
17:23 - [Music]
17:24 - and now
17:25 - i think that we should take a look at
17:27 - dance party and see how we can use
17:29 - events to make these dancers move
17:32 - so let me go ahead and pull that up
17:37 - great
17:39 - okay
17:40 - so i already have it set up uh so our
17:43 - characters on the screen the cat um but
17:46 - the cat won't be able to move until we
17:48 - add our event block
17:50 - so our event block here when up is
17:53 - pressed
17:54 - what dance move should we have the cat
17:57 - do
17:58 - so we have let's see all of these
18:01 - options
18:03 - shall we try the body roll
18:06 - let's try it and we can have it go to
18:08 - the left or the right which one um
18:11 - the
18:12 - the right yeah okay
18:14 - and it's very important to make sure
18:16 - that we have the cat matched up here or
18:19 - else it wouldn't work
18:21 - um so let's go ahead and
18:25 - run our some our code and i will be
18:29 - pressing the up button
18:41 - amazing
18:43 - he took the body roll
18:45 - um okay great so let's add some measures
18:48 - to the mix
18:49 - um
18:50 - let's connect our event blocks to music
18:52 - measures to make this shark uh dance to
18:55 - music
18:56 - after four measures what should we have
18:59 - the shark do
19:01 - um
19:03 - let's see
19:05 - shall we
19:08 - let's do the double down double down
19:10 - okay
19:11 - to the left or right
19:14 - and i left this time
19:16 - great let's try it
19:24 - [Music]
19:35 - [Music]
19:38 - that was great
19:39 - i'm thinking it would be pretty boring
19:41 - though to have the same dance move for a
19:43 - full song so what if we change the dance
19:46 - move after a few measures
19:49 - um and let's also add a background um
19:53 - and some backup dancers
19:55 - what do you think the background should
19:56 - be
19:58 - um
19:59 - let's go with tropical just as as an ode
20:02 - to dar es salaam where we are
20:04 - great and we can have an effect as well
20:08 - if we want one
20:10 - um we could go with the
20:13 - laser dance floor okay that sounds like
20:16 - a fun combination
20:18 - um so let's have our front and center
20:22 - character what would we like that to be
20:25 - this time
20:26 - um
20:28 - let's see for troll well let's do it
20:30 - with unicorn okay yeah i like unicorn
20:34 - and then
20:36 - let's have our backup dancers come after
20:40 - four measures
20:42 - so we will add them then what would you
20:45 - like our backup dancers to be well who
20:48 - would typically dance with the unicorn
20:53 - pineapples to watch the tropics oh yeah
20:56 - that works i like that
20:58 - and how many of them should we have
21:03 - maybe not too many right maybe
21:06 - let's try seven because that's a lucky
21:08 - number okay i like your number
21:11 - and what uh format will we like them in
21:15 - um
21:17 - they could go with uh diamond
21:20 - diamond that's great
21:22 - okay so now we have to decide um what
21:25 - the dance moves they're going to do
21:28 - so
21:30 - let's see
21:31 - um
21:32 - after four measures
21:35 - all right let's change it let's let's
21:37 - let the um unicorns start dancing before
21:41 - right
21:42 - they come on i think that would be cool
21:45 - so
21:46 - we need to
21:49 - have
21:52 - the
21:52 - unicorn
21:54 - do what dance
21:56 - uh well they could do refresh
21:59 - fresh i like that
22:01 - and then maybe after four measures when
22:05 - oh we don't need to add that again
22:06 - actually we can put it here
22:09 - um so after forum measures what should
22:13 - we have the pineapples do
22:16 - what goes with fresh
22:21 - [Music]
22:24 - should they do the floss yeah let's try
22:26 - that
22:28 - and then
22:29 - do we want to change it so after maybe
22:32 - eight measures
22:34 - they all do something together
22:36 - i could all sort of finish with a let's
22:40 - see they could do
22:44 - uh
22:46 - maybe gangnam
22:48 - okay let's try that one let's go ahead
22:50 - and run it and see how it looks
23:11 - great
23:12 - i hope i won't be asked to reenact all
23:15 - these dances myself
23:18 - it'd be nice to have both of you do that
23:27 - um okay that was great so we could
23:31 - continue on as i'm sure you know and
23:33 - come up with endless creations but
23:36 - instead
23:37 - let's challenge our viewers to
23:39 - experiment on their own and do an hour
23:41 - of code with dance party at home
23:46 - so
23:46 - thanks for helping us dance our way
23:48 - through learning events nancy it's a
23:51 - pleasure
23:53 - thank you nancy thank you i really
23:55 - appreciate it
23:56 - thanks for joining
23:59 - okay so we can bring on uh another great

24:57 - and the new york academy of science
25:00 - wow welcome stella
25:03 - thank you so much lansing
25:05 - i said i'm so sorry caroline
25:08 - it's a pleasure having me today yes it's

25:40 - yeah i think he lost me or we we lost
25:43 - everybody
25:45 - okay
25:46 - you lost
25:48 - me for a minute
25:50 - oh that's my they talk to you
25:55 - i see you now i think we're ready to go
25:58 - okay
26:01 - can you see me yet
26:03 - yes we can
26:08 - hello
26:12 - yes
26:13 - okay so that's i that's it happening uh
26:16 - computer freezing up
26:18 - uh so uh
26:20 - i
26:21 - i have a couple of questions for you
26:24 - um
26:25 - you know i i hope you don't mind that
26:27 - i'm starting with the questions
26:30 - so how did you begin to get involved
26:32 - with computer science uh you know we
26:35 - we heard about the great work that
26:36 - you're doing in nigeria for working on
26:39 - robotics working on
26:40 - um coding
26:42 - uh technovation and all this other stuff
26:44 - that you do how did you get
26:46 - involved how did you begin how did you
26:49 - start for you
26:50 - okay um i would like to go back a little
26:53 - bit um to um growing up
26:56 - because it all started for me growing up
26:58 - so i uh i have a first degree in
27:02 - electrical electronics
27:03 - and when i was coming up i
27:06 - saw the link between computer and
27:09 - electrical electronics but um
27:12 - then computers were sacred i mean my
27:14 - younger brother was reading computer
27:16 - science in the same school so i kept
27:18 - visiting him in the department but i saw
27:20 - that the computers they had in their
27:22 - department was separate i mean it was
27:24 - just uh a monument so um that got me
27:28 - thinking now what is in this box you
27:30 - know and all that so but
27:32 - that made me begin to ask questions and
27:35 - then began
27:36 - before you know it my younger brother
27:38 - had to set up a computer science um and
27:41 - a computer hub where he was teaching
27:44 - little kids and then before that we
27:46 - began to think that um we saw one guy i
27:49 - think his name is tiday too one was
27:52 - young
27:52 - he he he he virtually closes his eyes
27:56 - and uses the system and we thought he
27:57 - was a witch i tell you so
28:00 - we have to demystify a lot of things
28:02 - around it so um
28:05 - with time i saw that it was a necessary
28:08 - tool i mean it wasn't just a luxury it
28:10 - was a necessary tool for
28:12 - every child growing up and so um i began
28:14 - to venture ask questions began um and i
28:18 - think that's how i also came across you
28:21 - uh so um
28:22 - and i i did a lot of uh inquiry and then
28:25 - i also got across to code.org and since
28:28 - they had uh a structured curriculum that
28:31 - you can use actually used to teach
28:33 - uh children and in fact what got me um
28:37 - very involved with code that's august
28:38 - the day i saw that they they wrote that
28:41 - it's for kids between it for people
28:42 - between four and hundred and to i think
28:45 - 106 years yeah so i was like wow that's
28:48 - a great one so um
28:50 - basically that's how i got into it and i
28:53 - saw that there was a great gap and
28:55 - skills that kids could learn to help
28:58 - them in their future and of course this
29:00 - is a digital economy i mean we can't run
29:02 - away from it so basically that's how i
29:04 - got involved and entangled in a lot of
29:07 - things around it
29:09 - great interesting
29:11 - uh so you you
29:13 - honestly they i haven't heard anyone
29:16 - explain it
29:17 - better than how you just explained it
29:19 - it's uh it's required for everybody uh
29:22 - it's required for it's lifelong learning
29:24 - it's for kids two to one or six i'll say
29:28 - i'll add maybe a couple more years to
29:30 - that to make it one twenty years
29:32 - of as long as for as long as you leave
29:35 - so um
29:37 - now the pandemic happened last year i
29:40 - was still right in the middle of it
29:44 - how is the job or work on all the eeg
29:47 - all the programs that you've run all
29:49 - those fantastic work that you've been
29:50 - doing over the years
29:52 - that you built up to uh what you was in
29:55 - 2019
29:57 - how has it changed since the pandemic
30:00 - yeah when we when the pandemic started
30:03 - we thought it was impossible
30:05 - to teach computer science um
30:09 - over
30:10 - a computer
30:11 - so let me just say like that we thought
30:13 - i mean because it needs um
30:16 - hands-on skills and all that so you
30:18 - actually need to be there for the person
30:20 - to be able to understand
30:22 - um and then a lot of parents who
30:24 - especially here in africa thought it was
30:26 - also impossible for um this kind of
30:29 - skills to be um
30:31 - learnt without you having enhanced a
30:34 - one-on-one um
30:36 - field but um the pandemic taught us that
30:39 - and quickly taught us that it's not um
30:42 - it's not um
30:43 - impossible and so we saw that a lot of
30:46 - things began to change in fact i had an
30:49 - inquiry yesterday and i told the person
30:51 - oh we're going to do online said oh i'm
30:53 - fine with it well before now if you say
30:55 - we're going to do an online course for
30:57 - computer they would say it's not
30:58 - possible so um it has changed um
31:02 - our
31:03 - reach because we can actually sit in our
31:06 - offices and be able to reach out to so
31:09 - many more people and at the same time
31:12 - and um just like what is happening
31:14 - before now maybe um code.org would have
31:17 - been you know we have to bring all these
31:18 - people together in a space but right now
31:21 - it's um it's um all changed and the
31:24 - pandemic um
31:26 - made it made us swallow it because by
31:29 - force whether we liked it or not so um
31:31 - my work has changed and
31:34 - i'm able to reach more people at the
31:36 - same time i don't have to travel all the
31:38 - way for me to be able to be involved in
31:41 - a lot of things so um
31:43 - the pandemic has actually changed our
31:44 - work and then more kids have begun to
31:47 - and more parents have begun to
31:48 - understand that we need the device to be
31:51 - able to make your child also participate
31:54 - in augustine so basically that's it
31:56 - very very interesting so i post the same
31:59 - question to
32:00 - the guest who came before you um
32:04 - now we've transitioned from
32:06 - in person hands-on experiential hands-on
32:08 - learning
32:09 - uh with people to
32:11 - virtual
32:12 - to you know or hybrid
32:14 - form
32:15 - where you need to teach over the
32:18 - internet
32:19 - and there's a huge
32:22 - a serious
32:24 - issue around access around
32:26 - infrastructure uh there's a
32:29 - big poverty of infrastructure in africa
32:32 - and uh there's very low internet
32:34 - penetration rate in southern part of
32:37 - of nigeria for instance and other parts
32:39 - of africa how are you being able to
32:41 - overcome this
32:43 - with the transition that you're making
32:45 - into virtual uh uh training
32:49 - yeah um i want to say great kudos to
32:52 - code.org i know i was in the um
32:55 - conference
32:56 - two years ago
32:58 - um that was in the
33:01 - worst name of the city i can't remember
33:03 - well it's in one of the cities and um a
33:06 - lot of us mentioned that
33:08 - because of the
33:11 - penetration of um um internet we would
33:14 - want to advocate for offline
33:17 - and we saw that coming so we can
33:20 - actually have these things dumped on our
33:23 - system for everyone to be
33:26 - to partake of it and i heard you while
33:29 - you were giving the opening um
33:31 - um
33:33 - um
33:34 - speech or whatever
33:35 - while you were talking you mentioned
33:37 - that you now have an app so that can
33:39 - actually sit on everyone's
33:42 - phone to be able to start learning
33:44 - to code yeah so um access for internet
33:48 - um and the young man who won the um
33:52 - global teacher award of 100 million two
33:55 - years ago from kenya peter
33:58 - um he does what he does was he what he
34:01 - does for he goes up to eight kilometers
34:05 - or ten kilometers to charge one laptop
34:08 - and then um he's able to download some
34:11 - of the things on it and then come back
34:13 - to school to teach these children and
34:15 - they were able to run on competitions
34:18 - and you know a lot of things so it
34:20 - didn't stop them they were able to
34:22 - because of the um
34:25 - those things he could download so um
34:27 - they didn't have internet in the village
34:28 - where he was teaching but these children
34:30 - did not lack um
34:32 - i mean things that were evident or that
34:36 - were available on the internet so the
34:37 - teacher was also doing that i think he
34:39 - got an award of 100 million two years
34:42 - ago he's from kenya
34:43 - peter so i've invited him i think i met
34:46 - him
34:47 - at the conference two years ago in um in
34:49 - the u.s so i mean um
34:52 - we just learned to solve our problem in
34:55 - a
34:56 - peculiar way so that
34:57 - we don't get cut off because
35:00 - given reasons or excuses for
35:03 - not um being um
35:05 - excluded it's not um it's not um it's
35:07 - not it at all so we should and so um a
35:10 - lot of solutions are coming offline that
35:13 - um everyone can be involved in
35:16 - very good what i heard you say is you
35:19 - you people
35:21 - from
35:22 - virtual
35:23 - i mean from physical to virtual because
35:26 - you have the will
35:27 - and you want to really make this imp you
35:30 - know make an impact on the environment
35:31 - that you live in
35:33 - and whatever obstacles
35:35 - you you you face you're going to try to
35:38 - surmount them and that's uh that that's
35:40 - the spirit that's the spirit
35:42 - yeah so
35:44 - and that leads me to this question what
35:46 - are your key goals as an organization i
35:48 - mean odyssey foundation what are the key
35:52 - goals that you what is your north star
35:54 - where are you heading
35:57 - yeah um
35:58 - [Music]
35:59 - we're heading to ensure that um
36:02 - every african child
36:04 - is able to uh be represented on the
36:07 - um cyber space is able to represented i
36:11 - mean have um
36:14 - recognition when it comes to digital
36:16 - technology and um is able to and
36:18 - especially the delta because of course i
36:20 - know what it is in my class we had very
36:23 - few girls and i was a judge recently in
36:27 - one of the programs that had the
36:29 - national association of all um
36:32 - computer science students in the whole
36:34 - of nigeria and we had just four girls
36:36 - and we had over 40 teams so um
36:41 - there's a need for us to um cover up the
36:44 - space and then odyssey educational
36:46 - foundation is running in this
36:49 - space to ensure that
36:51 - the goal of ensuring that every
36:54 - child is not left behind as one of the
36:57 - sdg says and that education too is not
37:01 - does not it's not only for the week and
37:04 - we're trying to ensure that we reach out
37:06 - to the indigent the underserved in
37:09 - nigeria for them to become um to have a
37:13 - voice when it comes to digital
37:15 - technology so basically that's what we
37:17 - do
37:18 - very good it's good to see people like
37:20 - yourself and nancy role modeling
37:24 - that women or girl involvement in a stem
37:28 - or steam or computer science
37:30 - and i i'm sure a lot of girls are
37:33 - watching today and
37:34 - some of them will be reaching out to you
37:36 - to find out how do we key into this how
37:38 - do we become like you or do we uh
37:41 - further career in the in the area of
37:44 - stem
37:45 - uh so what why do you think it's very
37:47 - important i know you talked about this
37:50 - in part
37:50 - but are there other reasons
37:53 - that you think
37:55 - uh
37:56 - are very important for
37:58 - young learners
38:00 - in africa to learn computer science
38:03 - yeah like you also said when you were
38:05 - talking i want to quote you you
38:07 - mentioned that um we love we teach these
38:10 - kids computer science coding and all
38:12 - that not because we want all of them to
38:14 - become computer scientists like you are
38:17 - or we want them to all uh become medical
38:20 - doctors or be in the technology space
38:23 - but like you said the skills they
38:25 - acquire
38:26 - are actually used um to help them become
38:29 - whatever they want to become because
38:31 - right now we're talking about um all of
38:34 - us becoming lifelong learners and those
38:37 - skills like team playing
38:39 - collaboration and all that that we all
38:41 - get while we're learning to code and all
38:44 - that are some of the um skills for the
38:46 - future and then there's the need for
38:49 - every child in africa to also um run and
38:53 - have the skills in them and i mean that
38:56 - will help us
38:58 - become what we want to be in the very
39:01 - near future
39:03 - thank you so much so if uh kids want to
39:05 - get involved in coding or they want to
39:08 - contact otc education foundation how do
39:10 - they reach out to you
39:12 - oh yeah so on facebook as obviously
39:14 - educational foundation we're also on
39:16 - twitter we're on instagram
39:19 - we are also on um
39:21 - on the website just google us and then
39:24 - you find us basically um that's up
39:27 - right and we have mentioned we're global
39:30 - now so i mean um distance is no more
39:34 - a barrier thank you
39:36 - yeah it internet is strong in the world
39:39 - okay so it's a good time thank you so
39:40 - much um stella really appreciate the
39:43 - good work that you're doing in africa
39:45 - most especially in nigeria
39:47 - i think it's the point
39:49 - it's our time again to bring you back
39:51 - caroline
39:52 - and let's do some
39:54 - activities with stella
39:57 - great
39:58 - thank you so much daddy
40:00 - uh
40:01 - stella are you ready to talk about
40:03 - artificial intelligence and machine
40:05 - learning
40:06 - oh sure i am
40:09 - great so artificial intelligence is a
40:12 - really broad term and it basically means
40:15 - anytime a computer does something that
40:17 - seems to be intelligent but before we
40:20 - talk about artificial intelligence let's
40:22 - talk about human intelligence
40:24 - humans are the most intelligent things
40:26 - on earth right
40:28 - but what is it that a human is good at
40:32 - so stella can you help me think of some
40:34 - ways that humans are smarter than other
40:36 - mammals
40:37 - oh yeah humans are smarter than them
40:41 - i really smart because
40:42 - we can descend
40:44 - i can actually descend by looking at
40:46 - your face sometimes when i see you i
40:48 - could say ah caroline it looks you're
40:50 - not happy today did you wake up on the
40:52 - right side you know uh we're able to
40:54 - descend we're able to um recognize
40:58 - patterns i mean if it's happening this
41:00 - way today it must happen this week or
41:03 - very close to this way the next time um
41:06 - we also learn from trial and error so
41:09 - basically that's why we say humans are
41:12 - intelligent and um today i think um
41:15 - machines are beginning to before now we
41:18 - used to say computers we're just garbage
41:20 - in and gabriella right now they are no
41:22 - more
41:23 - so we're adding a lot of stuff on them
41:26 - um
41:27 - learning using them to learn and are
41:30 - teaching them and then they become
41:32 - artificially intelligent so basically i
41:34 - think that's it yeah that was great you
41:37 - really hit the nail on the head there
41:39 - what makes humans unique is discernment
41:42 - intuition and recognizing patterns and
41:44 - learning from trial and error
41:46 - so our brains learn the to do these
41:49 - things and that is what ai is starting
41:51 - to help computers do learning to
41:53 - recognize patterns and trial and error
41:56 - and machine learning is how computers
41:58 - recognize patterns and make decisions
42:00 - without being explicitly programmed so
42:03 - that's all about what ai for oceans
42:06 - talks about um and i'd like to do a
42:09 - little bit of that activity with you if
42:11 - you are interested
42:14 - right let's get started i'm going to
42:16 - share my screen
42:18 - okay
42:21 - okay
42:23 - so here is our ai bot
42:26 - um it does not know the difference
42:29 - between fish and trash but it can
42:32 - recognize patterns
42:34 - so let's see if we can train the ai bot
42:37 - to learn the difference between fish and
42:39 - trash
42:41 - so
42:42 - is this a fish
42:49 - yes it's a fish
42:51 - okay yeah let's see that's a fish is
42:53 - this a fish
42:55 - yes it's a fish
43:10 - and we get our first sack and that is
43:12 - that 17 billion pounds of plastic into
43:14 - the ocean each year
43:18 - now we're going to keep going
43:20 - this is fish
43:22 - yeah
43:24 - um
43:25 - what about that
43:28 - for fish
43:29 - what about this one trash
43:31 - trash not a fish
43:33 - not a fish not a fish
43:36 - okay a fish
43:39 - a fish
43:41 - a fish
43:43 - a fish
43:48 - another fish
43:50 - and now we get our second fact
43:52 - 80 of ocean pollution comes from land
43:56 - debris and it's estimated to cost 13
43:58 - billion per year
44:01 - so
44:03 - ai learns from our choices if we make
44:05 - wrong choices ai will repeat our
44:07 - mistakes so the more that we train ai
44:11 - but the better
44:12 - it gets
44:13 - um but let's continue and see how we've
44:16 - done so far
44:18 - so let's see if
44:20 - ai knows what a fish looks like based on
44:22 - what we've already trained to do
44:28 - so let's see
44:42 - okay so here are some objects that ai
44:46 - bot identified as fish
44:48 - and let's see how he did
44:55 - these are fish but we do have a lot of
44:59 - trash in there still and then
45:02 - here's what a i bought identified as
45:06 - trash which is good we only have one
45:08 - fish there on the one place here
45:11 - so
45:12 - if we train ai a lot more maybe we can
45:16 - get to
45:17 - less trash
45:19 - um
45:21 - let's go on to the next
45:29 - so now
45:31 - we're going to train i ai about with a
45:33 - new question
45:35 - and that question is does this object
45:37 - belong in water
45:40 - so we're going to add other sea
45:41 - creatures into the mix and see what
45:43 - happens
45:59 - so ai only learns what we teach it
46:02 - because we didn't get any sea creatures
46:04 - when we were training ai bot
46:07 - so
46:07 - that is
46:10 - an important lesson and we're going to
46:13 - now teach ai bot
46:15 - to
46:16 - um answer the question does this belong
46:18 - in the water
46:19 - so what do we think does this belong in
46:21 - the water yes
46:23 - yes
46:24 - no
46:25 - no
46:26 - yes
46:29 - yes
46:31 - yes
46:34 - the ocean plastic debris can harm fish
46:37 - sea birds and marine mammals protecting
46:40 - seabirds and marine life is one of many
46:43 - reasons to keep the ocean clean
46:48 - okay so let's train ai bot a little bit
46:51 - more
46:52 - no no no
46:54 - yes
46:56 - yes
46:58 - no
46:59 - yes
47:01 - yes
47:02 - no
47:04 - yes
47:06 - yes
47:12 - okay let's go ahead and see how we've
47:14 - done so far with this
47:18 - so
47:19 - we are hoping that ai bot will do a
47:21 - better job identifying the sea creatures
47:24 - before with the new question
47:36 - it's looking okay so far let's pull it
47:38 - up
47:41 - here are objects that belong in water
47:45 - so
47:46 - a lot of them do not too much trash
47:49 - let's see these are the things that
47:51 - don't belong in water oh and that's
47:53 - really good that's all trash
47:55 - so
47:57 - one of the important lessons that we
47:59 - just learned is that it's important what
48:02 - questions you are using to train the
48:06 - machine
48:07 - um
48:08 - so
48:10 - um
48:12 - we
48:13 - um if we continued on with the lawson
48:16 - we'd have the opportunity to train ai
48:19 - more because the more data we give it
48:21 - the better it understands our patterns
48:24 - um so thank you stella for helping us
48:26 - understand how ai and machine learning
48:28 - work
48:30 - thank you
48:31 - thanks and now i'd like to have everyone
48:34 - back on screen so that we can
48:37 - say thanks
