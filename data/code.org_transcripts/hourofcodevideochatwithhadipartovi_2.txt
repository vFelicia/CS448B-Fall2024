00:03 - hi everybody hello welcome to your first
00:10 - hour of code I hope everybody's doing
00:14 - well this has been an amazingly exciting
00:16 - week for me at my organization code org
00:19 - is at you know we're barely one and a
00:22 - half years old or about to turn two
00:23 - years old and about three or four months
00:25 - it's incredible to see how far we as an
00:28 - organization of come but even with this
00:30 - campaign the hour of code we just
00:31 - launched it one year ago today's it's
00:33 - this week we're celebrating its second
00:35 - year and as of today we've already had
00:37 - 70 million students try one hour of code
00:41 - that's an unbelievable number all of
00:43 - this week every day of the week 5
00:45 - million students each day have tried the
00:47 - hour of code and you know what what
00:49 - started as an idea just about 16 17
00:52 - months ago has now blossomed into a
00:54 - campaign that is touching every single
00:57 - country in the world students in every
00:59 - language from every demographic in every
01:01 - age group all behind the simple idea
01:03 - that learning how computers work on the
01:05 - inside and learning how not only to use
01:07 - technology but how to create technology
01:09 - is something that everybody can learn no
01:12 - matter how old you are it's been so
01:14 - exciting to create something that has
01:15 - had such an impact and I'm so happy to
01:18 - share this moment with you at and I
01:21 - guess I'm open to questions as so should
01:24 - we start with Amy Beecham from David
01:26 - leader middle school and Ontario hi Amy
01:51 - sure and so the question is what
01:55 - inspired me to study computer science
01:56 - and how did I feel the first timer I
01:59 - realized I was good at it at so I grew
02:02 - up in Tehran Iran Iran is you know in
02:04 - the Middle East and when I was growing
02:06 - up there was actually during a war with
02:08 - Iraq it was not a good time to be living
02:10 - in that country there your fighter
02:12 - planes bombing our
02:13 - neighborhood every every evening and so
02:16 - I wasn't necessarily inspired to learn
02:17 - computer science as much as my it was
02:19 - there was not that much else to do my
02:20 - dad one day brought home a computer and
02:22 - back then this is like 30 years ago
02:24 - computers with these giant things and he
02:27 - said this doesn't have any games on it
02:29 - it doesn't have any programs on it but
02:31 - here's a book and if you want to have
02:33 - fun you can teach yourself and so I
02:35 - learned it how to do it from a book and
02:38 - you know what was amazing once I became
02:40 - good at it that what I really felt was
02:42 - empowered I felt that I can change
02:44 - whatever I want you know there's this
02:46 - you know there's a special feeling when
02:48 - you can think of something and dream it
02:50 - and imagine and that actually create it
02:52 - and see the thing that you created turn
02:54 - out the way you wanted that and that
02:57 - that is a great feeling you know when
02:58 - you're getting started you're not
02:59 - exactly sure what can this computer do
03:01 - or I make mistakes and I figure out how
03:03 - to fix them but when you finally see
03:05 - your imagination reflected in something
03:07 - that's on the screen that's the best
03:09 - feeling in the world right next question
03:14 - from Katie Frederick's school Clinton
03:16 - middle school in Clinton Michigan hi I'm
03:20 - Mikayla Fletcher and this is Ashley
03:22 - gauge our dance we're from Clinton
03:24 - middle school and Michigan and here's a
03:27 - question why are people so afraid of
03:30 - coding when it's everywhere that's a
03:33 - really good question at you know I
03:36 - actually don't think people are afraid
03:37 - of coding anymore i think in the last
03:39 - two years we've completely changed that
03:41 - you know if you ask people to three
03:44 - years ago they just assumed coding must
03:48 - be like calculus or rocket science or
03:50 - just as crazy thing that you know is
03:52 - meant only for the geniuses and that's
03:54 - because movies and television shows show
03:57 - pictures of these like you know boys in
04:00 - a basement drinking like energy drinks
04:02 - or if ones and zeros flashing across the
04:04 - screen and that and they just have this
04:06 - image of like the really weird genius
04:09 - coder and the reason is the people
04:11 - making those movies and making those TV
04:12 - shows they didn't learn it themselves
04:14 - it's not being taught in school and so
04:16 - they use their imagination for who's
04:18 - this type of student who does coding now
04:20 - that we've had 70 million students
04:22 - including you know middle school girls
04:24 - elementary school boys of all
04:26 - colors and backgrounds do it I think
04:29 - it's safe to say that it's no longer
04:30 - scary but but it's traditionally been
04:32 - held back by a stereotype you know when
04:35 - I was in school basically being good at
04:37 - coding was the nerdiest least popular
04:40 - thing you could possibly do so I was
04:42 - basically the biggest nerd in my school
04:43 - by far but at this point I think you
04:46 - know we've had people like will.i.am say
04:48 - that coders are the new rock stars and
04:50 - you know people who create the apps that
04:52 - we use in our daily lives there they're
04:54 - like superheroes in this country so i
04:56 - think it's no longer scary and it's no
04:58 - longer unpopular it's just a question of
05:00 - who can get good at it quickly enough
05:03 - add next question from New Jersey okay
05:08 - read the name of the school so from Tina
05:10 - jasoos class and Montgomery High School
05:13 - and skillman New Jersey hi I'm Mike
05:15 - running her and we are Montgomery High
05:17 - School so our question is in your
05:20 - opinion what is the best way to pursue a
05:22 - career in computer science as you know
05:27 - there's many actually different ways to
05:29 - pursue a career in computer science at
05:30 - you know this is a unique field you know
05:32 - the standard way to pursue any career is
05:34 - to go to college to get a degree in it
05:36 - and then find a job and this you know
05:39 - that is probably still the standard way
05:41 - that's how I got into it I studied it in
05:44 - college I got a job at Microsoft in the
05:46 - relatively early days of that company
05:48 - and you know right now in this country
05:50 - about 40,000 students a year graduate
05:53 - from America's colleges with a degree in
05:55 - computer science so think that's 40,000
05:58 - students but each year there's a hundred
06:00 - and forty thousand new jobs in computer
06:02 - science that's that's a huge mismatch
06:04 - between the jobs and the students
06:05 - there's so many more jobs that people
06:07 - need to get into this field that don't
06:08 - actually come out of college or more
06:10 - students need to go to college and study
06:12 - computer science but what's cool about
06:14 - this field is you don't actually need to
06:16 - college degree to be great at computer
06:17 - programming and there's so few people
06:19 - learning it but there's lots of people
06:22 - that get hired dropping out of college
06:23 - or even skipping college if they get
06:25 - really good and all the top college
06:28 - courses in computer science are actually
06:29 - available online as well I don't think
06:32 - there's any other field that has so many
06:35 - successful college dropouts and I'm not
06:37 - suggesting anybody here avoid college or
06:40 - drop out of college but I'm just
06:42 - pointing out if there's a single field
06:43 - that you could get good at and either
06:45 - skip or drop out of college it's this
06:47 - one it basically because the computer
06:49 - doesn't recognize if you're black or
06:51 - white if you're a girl or a boy or if
06:53 - you have a computer if you have a
06:55 - college degree or not the computer just
06:57 - does what you tell it to do and if you
06:59 - know how to tell it to do things that
07:00 - are amazing and that blow people away
07:02 - you can get hired frankly no matter what
07:05 - I actually my first job as a computer
07:07 - programmer was when I was ninth grade
07:09 - that was 15 years old it was actually
07:12 - illegal for them to hire me because I
07:14 - was too young to get a to get paid for
07:16 - work and I didn't tell them my age that
07:18 - but you know that was the beginning of
07:21 - my career you know at a time when my
07:23 - fellow students were working or actually
07:25 - my fellow students weren't even working
07:26 - because we're too young had that you
07:28 - know one year later other students would
07:29 - work in gas stations or things like that
07:32 - I was by far the best paid kid in my
07:34 - school I was I still wasn't popular at
07:36 - all but I was getting paid very well
07:39 - because I could do computer programming
07:40 - as well as any of the other adults good
07:41 - at so as long as you work on it you can
07:44 - learn it at home where you can learn it
07:45 - at school it's a fantastic career at
07:48 - that said the reason code org is
07:51 - teaching kids this isn't if we go into
07:53 - the careers it's because even if you
07:54 - want to become a doctor in 20 years
07:57 - you're going to need to know how
07:58 - technology works if you want to become a
08:00 - lawyer a politician a pilot no matter
08:04 - what you want to get into every single
08:06 - field is getting turned upside down by
08:08 - technology if you want to become a
08:10 - chemist the Nobel Prize winner in
08:12 - chemistry last year was a computer
08:14 - scientist if you want to study birds the
08:17 - biggest advancement in understanding how
08:18 - birds fly was made by computer
08:20 - scientists and I can give many many
08:23 - examples but you know I'm sure nobody
08:25 - here in this room is a budding
08:27 - ornithologist wanting to study birds but
08:29 - whatever it is you want to get into at
08:31 - technology is changing the world so much
08:33 - that's really important to understand I
08:37 - write the next question from Atlanta
08:39 - Georgia from Lori smith's class of the
08:42 - charter middle school hey I'm will would
08:45 - and um from PG charter middle school and
08:48 - our question is what kind of jobs are
08:50 - available for people who are both
08:52 - creative and
08:53 - computer science that's a great question
08:56 - your computer science is in naturally
08:59 - creative field there's some jobs where
09:01 - somebody says this is exactly what I
09:03 - want yeah the thing i want to make to
09:05 - look like and can you just coat it up
09:06 - and those jobs are sort of you know the
09:09 - more good you get that's more like
09:11 - taking dictation most computer
09:13 - scientists or software engineers are
09:15 - given kind of an open-ended problem and
09:17 - they build near they combine creativity
09:20 - and problem solving at once your
09:22 - computer science is one of the few
09:23 - fields that's like a match is like a
09:25 - cross section between art class and math
09:27 - class because you have to do both things
09:29 - at once at certainly game design is an
09:32 - easy option to think of you know every
09:34 - single computer game out there is being
09:36 - made by people who are both good at
09:38 - writing code and creative at thinking
09:40 - about what are the things that could be
09:41 - done but I code but outside of game
09:43 - design the people making almost all the
09:46 - movie effects every single movie watch
09:48 - these days at least some of it was made
09:50 - by computers and computer programs and
09:52 - you know the animated films you see from
09:54 - Pixar or Disney or places like that the
09:57 - entire movie was made by computers and
09:59 - again the people doing that you know if
10:01 - you if you watch the movie frozen and
10:03 - also shoots ice out of her hands or you
10:06 - watch The Hobbit movie or the lord of
10:07 - the rings movies and the dragon is
10:09 - breathing fire there's somebody there
10:11 - who's actually figuring out how can we
10:12 - use a computer how could we create
10:14 - something that's never been seen before
10:15 - in the real world fire coming out of the
10:17 - dragon's mouth or ice coming out of a
10:20 - woman's hands you're you're thinking
10:24 - creatively you know that's not something
10:25 - you're modeling at over the real world
10:27 - but you're creating a computer model of
10:28 - what that should look like and then
10:29 - running an algorithm that traces every
10:32 - point of light that would hit this
10:33 - computer model to then create you know
10:35 - every single frame of one of those
10:36 - scenes is made by a computer program and
10:39 - then the model changes then you make
10:40 - your next frame so that there's a lot of
10:43 - different fields that are getting
10:44 - changed by computer science all of them
10:46 - involve not just problem solving but
10:48 - also the creative side as well mmm next
10:53 - question for Liz Whitney's class ridge
10:56 - crest elementary school and shoreline
10:58 - Washington that's really close to where
10:59 - I live hi guys we can't hear you so now
11:04 - we can hear you okay
11:06 - welcome what is your favorite app and
11:15 - why this is a tough question because I'm
11:19 - going to make you know all the other
11:20 - apps that aren't my favorite going to be
11:22 - unhappy if I if I pick one favorite but
11:25 - you know the one app that I probably get
11:28 - most happy when I use it and and you
11:30 - know you guys are in elementary school
11:32 - so you might not be familiar with this
11:33 - is an app called uber and what uber is
11:36 - for is for calling a car to go from one
11:38 - place to another and i travel a whole
11:41 - lot for code or I probably once or twice
11:43 - every week I'm in a new city and so I
11:46 - don't have my car with me and what I
11:48 - used to do is I would rent a car when
11:49 - I'm in a new city but then I have to
11:51 - learn the city and you know always deal
11:53 - with driving directions and so on and
11:55 - calling a taxi isn't very easy either
11:57 - I've both uber I can just say this is
12:00 - where I want to go it actually comes
12:01 - straight out of my calendar and two
12:03 - minutes later a car picks up they
12:04 - already know the destination they know
12:06 - where I am the GPS and the phone tells
12:09 - the car where I am and my calendar tells
12:11 - them where I want to go and so I don't
12:13 - really need to think about it this car
12:15 - just comes and picks me up yeah and one
12:17 - of the reasons why that's my favorite
12:19 - app is because you know most people
12:21 - think of technology in the format of
12:23 - games or like an Xbox or a website and
12:26 - it's all digital and it doesn't connect
12:28 - to the physical world what we're going
12:30 - to see in the next 20 years is a lot
12:32 - more technology connecting the digital
12:34 - world of your phone or your website to
12:37 - the physical world of automobiles or
12:39 - airplanes or other things that you see
12:41 - in life and you know one day the uber
12:44 - app should be able to call you click it
12:46 - and get a car and the car doesn't even
12:48 - have a driver in it you know there's
12:50 - there's people who are working out on
12:52 - cars that drive themselves so one day I
12:54 - should be able to touch on my phone and
12:55 - said I want a car to come to my house a
12:57 - car shows up with no driver it already
13:00 - knows where I want to go and takes me
13:01 - there I'm thinking about technology that
13:04 - is something that expands beyond phones
13:06 - and tablets and PCs and xboxes to think
13:09 - about it as touching everything you see
13:10 - around your world is part of why this is
13:13 - an exciting field and that's also part
13:15 - of why the uber app is one of my
13:16 - favorites because it really ties those
13:18 - things together
13:19 - I don't know how to explain that
13:22 - question very well I'm from UM from the
13:27 - yep from the Bedford charter foreigners
13:29 - studies at Northridge California hi my
13:35 - name is Caitlin and I go to Bedford
13:37 - Elementary I live in Los Angeles and my
13:39 - question for you is what's another
13:42 - startup you you enjoyed working on in
13:44 - why either at it well it's great to hear
13:49 - from um I've worked with a whole lot of
13:51 - startups you know I started to my own
13:53 - startups one of which was quite
13:55 - successful one of which was kind of a
13:56 - failure but you know some of the most
13:58 - fun I've had is working as an advisor
14:01 - investor out with different startups and
14:03 - to the startups I've had the most fun
14:05 - working with when they're very very
14:07 - small our Facebook and Dropbox and none
14:10 - of those I think Dropbox probably was
14:12 - the one that was the most fun with for
14:13 - me now how many people here know what
14:15 - drop boxes does anybody notice okay a
14:18 - handful you know so you know those of
14:20 - you who use if you use computers you
14:22 - know every time you're using a computer
14:24 - a lot of what you create as documents
14:26 - and files that you save on your computer
14:28 - Dropbox lets you save all of your stuff
14:31 - whether it's your photos documents files
14:33 - emails somewhere on dropbox of services
14:36 - with even if you lose your computer or
14:38 - you switch computers or you want to get
14:40 - your stuff when you're on your mobile
14:41 - phone it's available anywhere at the
14:44 - reason that was fun for me isn't just
14:45 - because of what they built but because I
14:47 - got involved when it was only two people
14:49 - that the company was two people in the
14:51 - product had only just started and now
14:53 - it's been almost seven years the company
14:56 - is a few hundred people but they have
14:58 - 300 million users using their service
15:01 - and it's like a multi-billion dollar
15:02 - major success story and watching a
15:04 - company go from just two people to to a
15:08 - few hundred and seeing it going value to
15:10 - create tens of billions of dollars of
15:12 - value in just seven years has been
15:15 - amazing and this is one of the amazing
15:16 - things about technology is that you can
15:18 - see very small groups of people make a
15:21 - ton of impact and also a ton of money at
15:24 - you know many of you here may use
15:26 - whatsapp I wasn't personally involved
15:28 - with what's up for that company you know
15:29 - it's like 50 people made it you know too
15:32 - founders started the team became just 50
15:34 - people they sold it for 19 billion
15:36 - dollars it's amazing to see how quickly
15:38 - these companies can grow and drop box on
15:41 - the startups I've been involved it was
15:43 - going to one of the fastest growing and
15:45 - most fulfilling for me to see em the
15:48 - other startup I did which was really fun
15:50 - my own startup I like was in the music
15:53 - space that wasn't nearly as successful
15:55 - is probably my least successful endeavor
15:58 - but one thing that was really fun about
16:00 - it was it was in the music space and by
16:03 - working in music I got to meet a lot of
16:05 - really cool I guess artists and
16:08 - musicians and so a lot of people that
16:10 - were personally my own favorite artists
16:12 - and musicians I got to meet because I
16:13 - was running a music company you know I
16:16 - like was a predecessor of Spotify and
16:18 - Pandora if you used those services now
16:20 - it was a similar space but I think
16:22 - before its time and the company wasn't
16:24 - successful but getting to hang out with
16:25 - all these cool musicians was pretty neat
16:28 - am pride from Valerie de paolis class in
16:32 - fenton Michigan from Boyd Arthur middle
16:35 - school hello my name is Brendan snows
16:40 - and I then this is void Arthur's middle
16:42 - school my question is what qualities and
16:46 - skills you look for in the people that
16:49 - work at code.org hi Brendan that's a
16:53 - really fantastic question code.org has a
16:55 - lot of different types of people you
16:57 - know we have software engineers that
16:59 - make things like the Angry Birds puzzle
17:02 - or the honor and Elsa sort of hour of
17:04 - code activities and all the sort of
17:05 - tutorials that are online and those
17:07 - people are computer programmers they
17:09 - studied computer science in college and
17:12 - they you know they can build any website
17:13 - or any app but they're working here to
17:15 - build our website and our apps and then
17:18 - we also have teachers there's a whole
17:20 - bunch of computer science teachers that
17:22 - left their own school to come work for
17:24 - us and they're actually kind of sad
17:27 - because they wish they could be teaching
17:28 - students but what they're really doing
17:30 - is helping us create curriculum that
17:32 - then rolls out and reaches millions of
17:34 - students so that you know as they aren't
17:36 - in the classroom anymore but their
17:37 - vehicle org teaching millions of
17:40 - students at you know the the thing we
17:42 - probably looked the most foreign all of
17:44 - our employees is
17:46 - I guess an empowerment and a sense of
17:48 - ability to change you know its most
17:50 - people when they do a job they have kind
17:52 - of a fixed roll like this is what we
17:54 - need you to do and it's going to be the
17:55 - same thing every week for a year for
17:58 - many years at code.org things are moving
18:01 - so fast that nobody knows what their job
18:03 - is going to be in three months if if you
18:06 - know we've only been around for 18
18:08 - months if somebody had told us 18 months
18:10 - ago that we would reach 70 million users
18:12 - and that we'd change laws in 16
18:15 - different states and we'd be in
18:16 - partnerships with all these school
18:17 - districts we you know nobody would have
18:19 - believed it and had half the things we
18:22 - do we come up with one week and then two
18:24 - months later it's not an entire
18:25 - initiative as so probably adaptability
18:28 - is the the top thing we look for that if
18:31 - you expect the job where the job is the
18:33 - same every day of the year at code.org
18:35 - is the wrong place to look for because
18:37 - we're moving too fast and things are
18:39 - changing too frequently um I think one
18:43 - last question is from Barbara quarless
18:46 - school east cobb middle school in
18:48 - Marietta Georgia hello my name's a keen
18:57 - Lauren has never been shy and more
19:00 - familiar back in east cobb middle school
19:02 - and um and our question for you is how
19:05 - is how do you see computer science
19:07 - impact in the future hi yes sir oh
19:13 - that's great i don't know if you know
19:14 - i'm an identical twin brother i'm an
19:16 - identical twin as well I I can't tell if
19:19 - you guys are identical or not it's
19:21 - really a fun having a twin growing up I
19:24 - certainly enjoyed it a lot in terms of
19:27 - how computer science and technology
19:30 - impacts the future you know first of all
19:33 - I'd say you guys are living in a unique
19:34 - time when half the stuff that you take
19:37 - for granted is stuff that only 10 years
19:39 - ago people thought wow that's the future
19:41 - you know and usually when people talk
19:45 - about the future they think like what's
19:47 - going to happen on in a hundred years or
19:48 - in 50 years right now just even thinking
19:50 - five years ahead there's incredible
19:52 - things that are happening you know I
19:55 - think within the next let's say 30 40
19:58 - years technology
20:00 - pure science is going to change so much
20:01 - in our world I mentioned earlier about
20:03 - not just cars that drive themselves but
20:06 - you want you don't need to own a car it
20:08 - can drive itself and in that kind of a
20:11 - world you know trucks can be able to
20:13 - drive themselves cargo ships should be
20:16 - able to drive themselves there's a whole
20:17 - lot of industries involving
20:19 - transportation that are going to be
20:20 - disrupted when you don't need as many
20:21 - humans think about when a cargo ship
20:23 - goes across the ocean there's a lot of
20:26 - expense with all the sailors on board
20:28 - there's a lot of danger and risk what if
20:31 - something happens and you know I think
20:33 - within 10 years we're going to see giant
20:35 - cargo ships that have nobody on them you
20:37 - just put them in the water and they go
20:38 - and they get to their destination and
20:40 - that's that's transportation in one
20:42 - place medicine is going to change a
20:44 - whole lot there's research already you
20:47 - know most of you see you know robots as
20:50 - kind of toys but robots are changing all
20:53 - sorts of things around us and in
20:55 - medicine people are already researching
20:56 - robots that are so small they're smaller
20:59 - than a cell that you can put in your
21:01 - body like you know inject them with like
21:04 - a needle and inject like a hundred
21:06 - thousand little robots into your body
21:08 - that then go around and cure diseases so
21:10 - people are researching how many here how
21:12 - many people here know what a white blood
21:14 - cell is so most of you should know what
21:17 - do I blood salads from your biology
21:19 - classes you know what a white blood cell
21:21 - does it learns how to fight disease but
21:24 - it needs some time to learn that and you
21:25 - know you need to get vaccinated which
21:27 - teaches your white blood cell but
21:29 - sometimes diseases you can't get over
21:31 - cuz your white blood cell its can't
21:32 - fight it or your immune system is weak
21:34 - so researchers are looking into
21:36 - basically computer-based robots that are
21:38 - so small that can do it the job of a
21:40 - white blood cell and download the cure
21:43 - to a disease off the internet and then
21:44 - start curing it inside your body I mean
21:46 - that's mind-blowing that's so different
21:48 - than you know the games you use on your
21:50 - iPad but the software inside that robot
21:53 - is built the exact same way and you know
21:57 - so I think maybe not in my lifetime but
22:00 - certainly in your guys lifetime you
22:02 - should see a day when all the popular
22:03 - diseases that everybody is getting you
22:06 - don't need to cure them by drinking more
22:08 - water or staying in or resting you cure
22:10 - them by downloading the cure straight
22:12 - into the robots
22:13 - body and I think you know as an example
22:15 - of change that's a pretty big change in
22:18 - our lives at you know another area of
22:20 - change is going to be construction how
22:23 - many people here have heard of 3d
22:24 - printers and so that looks like a lot of
22:28 - your you know so today 3d printers are
22:30 - these things they're about like this
22:32 - size and they can print these tiny
22:34 - little plasticky you know statuettes or
22:38 - so on and you don't think of a 3d
22:40 - printer is something that builds
22:41 - something useful that you use in your
22:43 - day-to-day life do you think of a 3d
22:45 - printer or something to build a little
22:46 - statuette that looks kind of cute and
22:48 - neat but it's not sort of game-changing
22:51 - at but there's not people that are
22:53 - building gigantic 3d printers that can
22:56 - 3d print an entire house so you know
22:59 - instead of bringing our construction
23:01 - crew and laying bricks and foundation
23:03 - and you know chopping wood or whatever
23:06 - there's places where they have an entire
23:08 - 3d printer it's a house-sized 3d printer
23:10 - that comes in they pour concrete into it
23:13 - and they pour like a bunch of materials
23:14 - in it and then it just lays foundation
23:16 - throws the walls up put something like
23:19 - the you know curtains whatever then
23:21 - again and then they roll it away and
23:23 - there's a house that was just built with
23:25 - no crew you know that that actually is
23:28 - happening today that's not in some sort
23:29 - of dream or lab there's actually one or
23:31 - two 3d printed houses in the Netherlands
23:33 - that people are living in that wasn't
23:35 - created by any humans who was created by
23:37 - a gigantic 3d printer these types of
23:40 - things I think are right around the
23:41 - corner by the time some of you kids are
23:43 - in college or just out of college so
23:46 - much is going to change in your lives
23:47 - whether in transportation construction
23:49 - medicine that dear one amazing thing
23:53 - about technology is if you can dream it
23:56 - it's pretty much possible it's just a
23:58 - matter of time that's not been the case
24:00 - in almost any other field that we think
24:03 - of but you know if you can imagine a
24:04 - computer doing it it kind of cannons
24:07 - there's a question of how long does it
24:08 - get until the hardware is fast enough
24:09 - until a computer program is is smart
24:12 - enough and that's part of why co.org is
24:15 - trying to get everybody to learn this
24:16 - field because no matter what you go into
24:18 - no matter what job you want or what
24:21 - career you want what area of research
24:22 - it's going to get changed over the next
24:24 - 20 years by technology
24:26 - and if you're not on top of it or not
24:28 - following it or not learning how
24:29 - technology works you're going to get
24:31 - left behind and you know in the 21st
24:33 - century that's that's not a really good
24:34 - thing yeah we're done with questions
24:38 - would add nobody asks a question about I
24:40 - don't even know if you guys even know
24:42 - that this happened but about one of the
24:43 - things that was probably the most unique
24:45 - thing that happened in not just in my
24:47 - week but in my life so how many people
24:50 - here have already done the hour of code
24:52 - has anybody done it already are you all
24:53 - just about to start all right so a lot
24:55 - of you have done the hour of code how
24:57 - many of you have done the the frozen
25:00 - themed one with Anna and Elsa drawing
25:02 - the ice fractals all right a lot of
25:05 - people did that one too um classes all
25:09 - clapping so there's one really special
25:11 - person that also did that exact same set
25:14 - of tutorials earlier this week and let
25:16 - me get his picture um so that's the
25:21 - president of the United States of doing
25:25 - the hour of code using the same exact
25:29 - frozen tutorial that many of you guys
25:31 - did you know the code that he rode was
25:33 - to get Elsa to draw a little square
25:35 - wasn't really complicated you know move
25:37 - forward turn right move for turn right
25:39 - eight times no sorry four times to draw
25:43 - a square but you know it's the very
25:45 - first time a president of the United
25:46 - States has written code and you know the
25:49 - reason it's the first time a president
25:51 - the united state has written code isn't
25:52 - because it's because you know mostly as
25:54 - presidents just it didn't exist when
25:56 - they were in school the average
25:57 - president is 50 60 70 years old and
25:59 - computers didn't exist when they were in
26:01 - school and so this president has decided
26:04 - you know even if I'm 53 years old even
26:07 - presidents should know how technology
26:10 - works if you're if you're a president of
26:12 - a country part of your job is setting
26:14 - the laws about how does the internet
26:15 - work how does music piracy how should
26:18 - that get regulated you know how do we
26:20 - protect our country from cyber warfare
26:22 - and people who are sort of hackers that
26:24 - are attacking our banks or so on and
26:27 - even if you want to become a president
26:28 - or senator understanding that technology
26:31 - is important if you want to regulate or
26:33 - be reinvented defense of the country um
26:35 - but more importantly he wanted to
26:37 - inspire kids to say no matter whether
26:38 - you're black or white or older
26:40 - at this is a field he can get into um
26:43 - the coolest thing about him doing it and
26:45 - I'll show the picture again at this hat
26:49 - that he's wearing is literally this one
26:52 - at not one like it but this specific hat
26:55 - had so I think I'm one of the only
26:57 - people in the world who was actually
26:59 - wearing something that's been on the on
27:00 - the head of the president at before so
27:03 - we were hoping he would keep the hat but
27:05 - at he left it behind so I got to keep it
27:07 - for myself M which is probably the one
27:11 - of the coolest personal things that came
27:13 - out of this whole experience you know
27:15 - starting an organization just as an idea
27:18 - a year and a half ago co.org started as
27:20 - a hobby for me I don't even know where
27:21 - was going to go I just thought I'd get
27:23 - started this seems interesting and
27:24 - seeing one year and a half later my own
27:27 - hat on the head of the president has
27:29 - been an incredible incredible journey
27:31 - and I wanted to actually thank all the
27:33 - teachers in this room for this for your
27:36 - support of computer science at what we
27:37 - do at Cobourg it's been incredible what
27:40 - you do for our children and thank you
27:42 - all and I hope you continue learning
27:43 - don't just do one hour at the point of
27:46 - one hour of code is just to realize that
27:48 - you can do it you know everybody in this
27:51 - country and in every country realizes
27:53 - technology is changing things you see
27:55 - things like Minecraft or Instagram or
27:58 - snapchat or whatever it is you use in
28:00 - your daily life your favorite things in
28:03 - the world are made by computer
28:04 - programmers and everybody knows that
28:06 - those people are getting wealthy you see
28:08 - billionaires all the wealthiest people
28:10 - in the world these days are these like
28:11 - college dropouts who started a company
28:14 - and it became facebook and now they have
28:15 - like thirty six billion dollars nobody
28:18 - needs to be told that that stuff is
28:19 - important but what most of you don't
28:21 - realize is that you can do it nobody
28:23 - needs to be told that it would be
28:25 - amazing to be the next Mark Zuckerberg
28:26 - who creates the next Facebook but most
28:29 - people don't realize that you could be
28:30 - that next Mark Zuckerberg and the whole
28:32 - point of the hour of code is just to get
28:34 - you realize that it's not as hard as you
28:35 - think but you need to stick with it so
28:37 - one hour isn't enough so at beyond your
28:40 - first hour please please try to stick
28:42 - with this field even if you don't become
28:43 - a computer program on you want to become
28:45 - a doctor please stick with it and thank
28:48 - you so much for your time and for your
28:50 - support
28:52 - you
