00:05 - hi and welcome my name is john balwid i
00:07 - work at the learning lab at santa fe
00:09 - institute i've been a classroom biology
00:11 - teacher and have a long-standing
00:13 - interest in understanding how to teach
00:14 - and learn with computer models and
00:16 - simulations
00:18 - in this video we're going to discuss the
00:20 - educational aspects of using models in
00:22 - the classroom
00:24 - including the theoretical foundations
00:26 - and the learning progression used in the
00:28 - curriculum
00:29 - first of all why should we model
00:32 - everyone is creating mental models of
00:34 - how the world works all the time we may
00:36 - not even be conscious that we're
00:37 - creating them
00:39 - when you say you understand something
00:41 - it usually means that you've created a
00:44 - mental model of the thing
00:46 - you can think of your mental models as
00:48 - being inside a box where no one else can
00:50 - see
00:52 - learning to make computer models
00:55 - forces us to make our mental models
00:57 - explicit or visible
00:59 - the models that we make become objects
01:01 - or artifacts that we can share and
01:03 - discuss
01:04 - making our mental models explicit
01:06 - forces
01:08 - us to confront our assumptions and makes
01:10 - us think about what we're attempting to
01:12 - model
01:14 - also bringing our mental models out of
01:16 - our minds and into the open by
01:18 - communicating them very clearly means
01:21 - that we can now compare them with other
01:23 - people's models and test them against
01:25 - real-world data
01:28 - we can also use models to test different
01:30 - scenarios to reveal trade-offs
01:33 - uncertainties and sensitivities and
01:35 - discover new questions and lines of
01:37 - investigation
01:40 - why are models so valuable when you
01:42 - think of models you might think of
01:43 - weather forecasting where models are
01:45 - used commonly to predict the weather in
01:47 - the future but models can do more than
01:49 - predict
01:50 - models can explain phenomena such as
01:52 - epidemic dynamics wealth distributions
01:56 - how energy flows through a food chain
01:59 - models can also suggest analogies which
02:02 - allow us to see connections between
02:03 - seemingly unrelated processes
02:06 - for example an epidemic is similar to
02:09 - other phenomena such as the spread of
02:11 - ideas revolution religions adoptions of
02:14 - innovations or even a forest fire models
02:18 - also raise new questions
02:20 - they can guide data collection in
02:22 - science you often need a theory before
02:24 - you know what data to collect
02:26 - for example
02:28 - maxwell's electromagnetic theory deduced
02:31 - the existence of radio waves which
02:33 - people then looked for and found models
02:36 - can help us think about what data to
02:38 - look for
02:39 - doing well on school exams can show you
02:41 - that you are able to answer someone
02:43 - else's question but perhaps a more
02:45 - important goal of education is can you
02:48 - ask a new question only new questions
02:51 - can produce new discoveries and new
02:52 - knowledge
02:53 - models help us generate new questions
02:56 - because they naturally lead us to ask
02:58 - what if
03:01 - the use of computer models as tools for
03:03 - thinking has a long history
03:06 - seymour paper was an mit professor from
03:09 - the 1960s to the 1980s and he invented a
03:12 - new theory of knowledge called
03:14 - constructionism paper defined
03:17 - constructionism as building relations
03:20 - between old and new knowledge in
03:22 - interactions with others while creating
03:25 - artifacts of social relevance
03:27 - paper built upon piaget's theory of
03:30 - constructivism which gave an essential
03:33 - role to the learner and his or her
03:35 - active engagement in knowledge
03:36 - construction but where
03:39 - as piaget saw a formal abstraction as
03:41 - the goal of knowledge construction paper
03:44 - valued both the abstract and concrete
03:46 - forms of knowledge and the social
03:48 - contact where such learning occurs when
03:51 - we're thinking about education
03:53 - constructionism focuses on how learning
03:56 - is constructed in the interactions
03:58 - between teachers and students as they
04:00 - engage in the design creation and
04:02 - discussion of learning artifacts
04:04 - pratt is probably best known for
04:06 - inventing logo a programming language
04:08 - that features a turtle that can follow
04:10 - simple movement commands and draw on a
04:12 - computer screen logo allows children to
04:15 - one identify with a computational object
04:19 - two to manipulate the turtle in ways
04:21 - similar to objects in the real world and
04:24 - three to connect personal experiences to
04:26 - mathematical concepts and operations
04:30 - computer models are a type of object to
04:32 - think with
04:35 - the agent-based modeling and simulation
04:37 - environments we use today are
04:39 - descendants of paper's original logo
04:41 - instead of using a single turtle we now
04:43 - create virtual worlds populated with
04:45 - many turtles or agents and through the
04:48 - interactions of the turtles we're able
04:50 - to model complex systems
04:53 - models are learning artifacts that can
04:54 - be designed created and discussed
04:57 - in the act of constructing learning
05:00 - using models enables learners to
05:03 - manipulate mathematical and scientific
05:05 - objects and conduct inquiry in new ways
05:08 - while at the same time potentially
05:10 - reassessing and or reinforcing content
05:13 - knowledge
05:14 - modifying models and creating models are
05:16 - even more constructionist in nature
05:19 - because they engage students in a design
05:21 - process to produce objects to think with
05:24 - that students can share and discuss with
05:26 - other people
05:30 - the use modify create progression can be
05:32 - followed when integrating models into
05:34 - the classroom practice
05:35 - as students move from use to modify to
05:38 - create they follow a progression from
05:41 - easier but less powerful learning to
05:43 - harder but more powerful learning
05:46 - they also progress from using someone
05:48 - else's creation to making a creation of
05:50 - their own in the use phase students are
05:53 - given a completed base model to work
05:55 - with
05:56 - they may run the model using different
05:58 - parameters they may make observations
06:00 - collect data and try to infer the rules
06:02 - of the model this type of activity takes
06:05 - less time to implement in the classroom
06:07 - than to modify or create
06:09 - teachers do need preparation time to
06:11 - select or modify an existing model or to
06:13 - create their own model and to design the
06:15 - activity for the students to interact
06:17 - with that model
06:19 - but be cautious in this phase time also
06:21 - must be allocated to look under the hood
06:24 - and discuss what is included in the
06:26 - model through examining the code and
06:28 - what has been left out of the model
06:31 - otherwise students may come away with
06:33 - connections between inputs and outputs
06:34 - but no real understanding of the
06:36 - mechanism or the why
06:38 - in the modify phase students can look at
06:41 - the rules of the model change the rules
06:43 - or add new ones this is a little harder
06:45 - and takes more classroom time to help
06:47 - students understand the model's rules
06:51 - because computer models built in star
06:53 - logo nova allow students to see the
06:55 - rules behind them students can uncover
06:57 - the assumptions of the person who made
06:59 - the model understand that the rules can
07:01 - be changed and see how these changes may
07:04 - affect how the model works
07:06 - in the create phase students design the
07:08 - model and determine its rules often
07:11 - multiple modifications of the model
07:13 - amount to creating this model from
07:14 - scratch this is the most time consuming
07:17 - and difficult activity along the
07:18 - progression because the need to teach
07:20 - students how to design and program but
07:22 - it also has the most potential for
07:24 - powerful deep learning
07:26 - circling back to piaget papered and
07:29 - constructivism students are able to
07:31 - fully participate in the process of
07:33 - making their mental models explicit to
07:36 - share and compare their models with
07:37 - others and to have the ownership of
07:39 - their ideas
07:40 - when students pose their own questions
07:42 - and then use a model of their own
07:44 - creation as an experimental testbed then
07:47 - analyze and share the results of their
07:49 - research the full power of the
07:51 - constructionist experience takes place
07:55 - the use modify create progression offers
07:58 - a scaffolded approach to developing
08:00 - student skills in modeling and
08:02 - simulation
08:12 - you
