00:04 - If I want to draw a rectangle 50 pixels tall
and that is twice as wide as it is tall, how
00:15 - would I program the computer to do that?
00:17 - Well, I could tell the artist to go up fifty,
turn right, and then go over 100 and move
00:24 - the whole thing twice.
00:25 - But then I'm doing the math for the computer.
00:28 - Multiplying fifty by two in your head may
not that hard but computers are really good
00:34 - at doing math so we should leave it to them
whenever possible.
00:38 - If I just used a variable called height instead,
then I could easily change height to fifty
00:43 - and then change my algorithm to tell the artist
to go up by height, turn right and then go
00:49 - over by height times 2, which gives us a rectangle
that is twice as wide as it is tall.
