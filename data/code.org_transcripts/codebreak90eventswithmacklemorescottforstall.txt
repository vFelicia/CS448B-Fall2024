02:01 - you can skip yet
02:27 - welcome to code break my name is hadi
02:29 - and there's so many people joining us
02:31 - across zoom on facebook live and on
02:33 - youtube live together we're hoping to
02:35 - build the world's largest live
02:36 - interactive classroom with so many
02:39 - students at home during this virus
02:40 - outbreak my team at code.org invites
02:42 - families everywhere to join us for a
02:44 - weekly dose of inspiration community and
02:46 - computer science
02:48 - i'm here with my daughter sophia who's a
02:50 - budding computer scientist
02:52 - and she's also my sidekick and she has a
02:54 - little sound board so she's going to
02:55 - make sounds for us
02:56 - during the this episode

03:27 - to pronounce
03:29 - how does it actually
03:30 - play out to the ear it's just
03:32 - challenging
03:33 - then your mom doesn't call you

04:19 - over the place
04:20 - and do you have any message to give to
04:22 - students who are all at home with school
04:24 - closed all around the world to inspire
04:25 - them about the importance of learning
04:27 - during this time
04:30 - i think it's super important for
04:32 - for all of us to keep our brain
04:35 - engaged to
04:37 - you know for me it was super important
04:39 - to create
04:40 - some sort of routine when i find myself
04:43 - like okay what am i doing today i'm just
04:44 - kind of floating
04:46 - that's when you know my mood can kind of
04:49 - go up and down and
04:51 - life gets a little bit weird i think
04:52 - that what i've found
04:54 - during
04:55 - this this
04:57 - pandemic is that structure is really
05:00 - important for me and keeping the brain
05:03 - active
05:04 - you know still focusing you know if
05:05 - you're in school still focusing on
05:07 - school work and making sure that we're
05:09 - just doing our our very best you know um
05:12 - and that goes for all of us
05:14 - whether you're in elementary school
05:16 - middle school high school or you're an
05:18 - adult i think just keeping the brain
05:20 - going really helps overall just keep our
05:23 - emotions even keel
05:26 - well thank you for sharing that
05:28 - um well to change the mood a little bit
05:30 - sophia's gonna get us started with the
05:31 - computer science joke of the day so if
05:34 - you're ready yes what is a computer's
05:36 - favorite type of music
05:42 - i have no idea
05:44 - it is disc oh

06:40 - a i'm going to do a quick screen share
06:42 - as people were joining this call we
06:44 - should map
06:46 - so you can actually see this map of
06:47 - where everybody's calling from uh you
06:49 - know this live zoom call has almost a
06:52 - thousand students calling from as far
06:54 - west as as hawaii where it's like 7 a.m
06:57 - and
06:58 - far east as far as new zealand or
07:01 - australia or japan
07:02 - uh it's pretty incredible the set of
07:04 - people who are calling i have one of my
07:06 - own cousins calling from iran right now

07:19 - so
07:20 - one thing i want to say as we go through
07:22 - this episode for those of you who are
07:23 - new if you have any questions during the
07:25 - episode whether for me or for macklemore

07:30 - questions to learn about it and today's
07:33 - uh episode is going to be super fun
07:36 - today we're going to learn about events
07:37 - and we have three parts we're going to
07:39 - learn about events unplugged in computer
07:42 - programming and then we're going to code
07:43 - our own dance and then we're going to
07:45 - learn about how to use advanced in apps
07:48 - we're going to start as always with the
07:50 - easy material first we have a lot of
07:52 - beginners if you're more advanced please
07:54 - be patient until we get to the more
07:55 - advanced stuff
07:57 - and ben just so you know our audience
07:59 - ranges from age six all the way to
08:01 - 60 or more uh although the probably the
08:04 - biggest group is basically 12 year olds
08:06 - or 13 year olds or 11 year olds like
08:08 - sophia
08:11 - before we go into lesson the lesson i
08:13 - want to welcome some guests to demo the

11:12 - in that is
11:16 - that the alien is
11:17 - collecting
11:19 - the gold medals
11:21 - and then with the game with
11:23 - the pink alien color

11:27 - [Music]
11:28 - all right well thank you so much for
11:30 - both of you uh
11:32 - i'm going to stop the screen share but i
11:34 - just want to say thank you to rifki to
11:36 - sharanya tamir and leni and to all the
11:38 - students who have made apps or games
11:40 - each week from the challenges that we
11:42 - send
11:43 - to you each week and at the end of the
11:44 - episode we're going to share out how you
11:47 - can sign up to get our weekly challenges
11:48 - to come on the show for next week so to
11:51 - start this week's uh episode our word of
11:54 - today is events
11:56 - when we program a computer we use events
11:58 - to tell the computer to do things in
12:00 - response to the user
12:02 - for example we might tell a computer
12:04 - that when the user clicks on an apple
12:06 - add one to the score or when the up
12:09 - arrow key is pressed move the screen up
12:12 - and today we want to model this with
12:13 - macklemore and with our students on
12:15 - camera with a fun event that is going to
12:17 - involve dancing as long as everybody's
12:19 - ready to dance uh so ben we sent you a
12:23 - secret package yesterday did you receive
12:25 - our secret package yes i have the secret
12:27 - package all right
12:29 - it says do not open until the show can
12:31 - you open that up and tell us what you
12:33 - see inside there absolutely
12:41 - looks like i got some some letters here
12:44 - all right let's see your letters
12:48 - some secret letters a
12:50 - whoa b
12:54 - and c all right
12:56 - so
12:57 - very secret thank you so what we want to
13:00 - do is we want ben to use events to
13:03 - choreograph all of us to dance and when
13:06 - i say all of us i mean everybody not
13:08 - just sophia and myself but everybody
13:10 - who's on camera and even those of you
13:12 - who are not on camera and the way we're
13:14 - going to do this using events is when an
13:17 - event happens we're going to do a dance
13:19 - move and an event is when ben holds up
13:22 - his card whether it's an a or a b or a c
13:25 - and for each one of those we're going to
13:26 - have a different dance move so let's
13:28 - start with what dance moves should we do
13:31 - when the when ben is holding up an a
13:33 - we're going to do an audience pull to
13:35 - let the audience choose the first dance
13:37 - move when we do the letter a can we put
13:39 - up the poll on screen
13:41 - so
13:43 - everybody can choose between a clap a
13:45 - knee kick a dab or a floss
13:49 - this is gonna look like a slightly tight
13:51 - race here uh all these votes coming in
13:55 - oh my gosh it's a really tight race
13:57 - between the dab and the floss
14:01 - all right uh we have
14:03 - 78 of you have voted
14:06 - i think we're gonna need to run this to
14:07 - the end to make sure we get a
14:09 - final winner
14:10 - the floss is barely ahead of the dab
14:15 - this is a pretty tight election what do
14:16 - you think ben
14:18 - this is intense i
14:20 - it's kind of we're gonna have to go
14:22 - individual accounts
14:24 - all right let's close the polls we're
14:26 - not done but i'd say the floss is the
14:28 - winner ooh close
14:31 - so when the a key is pressed
14:34 - and this is the code that maps to that
14:37 - when the when sorry when an a is showing
14:40 - our dancers are going to floss and
14:41 - sophia do you want to model that for us
14:43 - so that we know what a floss looks like
14:44 - for anybody who's not familiar
14:47 - so when an a is pressed that's the floss
14:51 - all right so ben we want you to choose
14:53 - the next stance move so when a b is is
14:56 - pressed uh what would you like you can
14:59 - your choices are a dab a clap or a kick
15:04 - uh you know i'm gonna have to go with uh
15:06 - the classic knee kick
15:08 - the knee kick all right so sophia was in
15:11 - last place i felt bad for the knee kick
15:14 - the knee kick
15:15 - so sofia is doing a knee kick
15:20 - yeah so
15:22 - when a b is showing
15:24 - everybody's going to knee kick so when a
15:26 - b is showing we want you to knee kick
15:28 - and you want to pick for our last move
15:31 - then for a c when the c is showing your
15:34 - choices are i think a clap now or a dab
15:38 - i think we got a dab got a dab sophia
15:41 - you want to model that for everybody to
15:42 - know what a dab looks like
15:44 - [Music]
15:47 - no no do it do it well not everybody
15:49 - knows what a dab looks like there's a
15:50 - dab
15:51 - right so
15:53 - when a c is showing the dancers are
15:55 - going to dab so i want to review this
15:57 - one more time this is a very simple
15:59 - program we've written
16:01 - and i want everybody to be doing this
16:03 - when an a is showing our dancers are
16:05 - going to floss
16:07 - and macklemore is going to be generating
16:09 - these events
16:10 - our code is that when a b is showing we
16:13 - want to kick
16:14 - and when a c is showing we want to dab
16:18 - so a is loss b is kick
16:21 - c is dab
16:23 - and ben when you're showing these i want
16:25 - you to uh also say the letters as well
16:27 - in case somebody has trouble seeing your
16:28 - camera so they can follow on with your
16:30 - voice as well so
16:32 - i think we're all gonna do this dance
16:34 - and i actually have a very special guest
16:36 - who hasn't ever joined us on code which
16:38 - is my six-year-old son
16:40 - marcy he's gonna join us as well hi
16:43 - so i'm gonna start the song
16:45 - ben are you ready to give us our events
16:48 - i'm ready to go all right and are all
16:50 - the dancers ready
16:52 - everybody on the screen is ready so
16:54 - we're going to start this dance ready
16:56 - set go
16:59 - hey
17:06 - [Music]
17:12 - hey
17:30 - hey
17:36 - okay
17:38 - well that was wonderful
17:42 - thank you for leading us in that ben i'm
17:44 - sure that wasn't what you were expecting
17:46 - when you got on this zoom call
17:48 - that was awesome
17:50 - and we're sending off muzzy off uh
17:53 - well
17:54 - that was the first live
17:56 - dance party coded on on a code break so
18:00 - what i wanted to do is actually see if
18:02 - we could write code to make the exact
18:04 - same dances happen by using code now
18:07 - using uh basically a tool on code.org
18:11 - called dance party and sophia here is
18:13 - gonna actually be my
18:15 - partner in crime coder and she's gonna
18:16 - basically code the exact same dance
18:19 - moves for us
18:20 - to do this i'm gonna screen share so
18:22 - just one second as my
18:24 - share my screen
18:29 - all right if you all see my screen over
18:31 - here on the left we're on code.org dance
18:33 - party and on the left is going to show
18:35 - where the dancers are on the right is
18:37 - where sophie is going to make the code
18:39 - and over here in all these little
18:41 - categories we have the commands she can
18:43 - use
18:44 - so sophia to start
18:46 - do you want to
18:48 - set up and give us a background for our
18:50 - dance world
18:52 - and ben do you want to help us choose a
18:54 - background sophia what are your two
18:55 - favorites my favorites are the fireworks
18:58 - in the laser dance floor
19:00 - oh
19:01 - laser dance floor laser dance floor it
19:04 - is right and sophia not put a dancer on
19:06 - the screen
19:08 - like
19:12 - always a cat all right and put them in
19:13 - the center of the screen
19:15 - [Music]
19:17 - all right now we want to use events just
19:19 - like we did all in person so go into the
19:21 - events area and say when a key is
19:24 - pressed but right now it says when the
19:26 - up arrow is pressed change that to the
19:27 - when the a key is pressed and if you
19:30 - remember we said when the a shows the
19:32 - dancers are going to floss
19:34 - so
19:36 - yep choose that one
19:37 - and make sure it's the cat just the cat
19:39 - yeah the cat is gonna floss
19:41 - and the dance move is gonna be a floss
19:44 - and now uh we can copy and paste to say
19:46 - when the b key is pressed so if you
19:48 - click on that block and copy and paste
19:50 - it
19:51 - and say when the b key is pressed
19:54 - and this is our code we wrote before
19:56 - when b is
19:57 - showing the dancer's kick
20:05 - and choose
20:06 - kick do you want to be a kick
20:09 - and now we copy again using command c to
20:12 - copy the block
20:13 - and command v to paste it
20:16 - it's up here it's up here so if you do
20:18 - it
20:26 - make sure these are all cats
20:29 - yes
20:32 - you want the cats
20:34 - dab so the a makes a floss
20:37 - the b is a kick and the c is a dab and
20:40 - before we run this uh one thing i point
20:42 - out i want to point out is last time
20:44 - when we played a song it was kind of a
20:45 - song that nobody ever heard before ben
20:48 - were you familiar with that song i'm
20:49 - guessing you weren't uh but for code.org
20:52 - dance party with the reason we chose a
20:54 - song nobody ever heard is because you
20:55 - don't want to use music in a way that's
20:57 - not licensed that's one of the things we
20:59 - teach in computer science is the
21:00 - importance of copyrights and licensing
21:03 - music but we're very lucky in code.org
21:05 - that we actually have all these awesome
21:07 - songs that were licensed and in fact the
21:09 - song can't hold us by macklemore and
21:10 - ryan lewis was the very first song
21:13 - that that code got the rights to use for
21:15 - educational purposes so we're going to
21:17 - use that song for sofia's dance and now
21:20 - she is going to control the dancers when
21:22 - we hit the run button so ready set go
21:27 - [Music]
21:31 - [Applause]
21:33 - [Music]
21:34 - [Applause]
21:38 - those are some big kicks
21:47 - so we can see sophia made her own little
21:49 - dance party where she's controlling it
21:50 - but one thing we could do with events is
21:52 - we can have a dance-off where so vni
21:54 - competes so i'm actually going to now
21:56 - write some code to make a second dancer
21:59 - to compete with sophia's little cat
22:01 - dancer

28:38 - hi there scott how are you doing hey i'm
28:40 - doing great
28:42 - considering
28:43 - we're all locked at home right now i'm
28:44 - doing okay
28:46 - where are you calling us from
28:48 - uh northern california yeah
28:49 - silicon valley
28:51 - awesome
28:52 - well yeah it's been a tough
28:55 - it's been a tough time being all here at
28:57 - home alone and and trying to deal with
29:01 - life on zoom and video conferencing
29:03 - scott is a dear friend i i met scott
29:05 - when i was i think 18 and you must have
29:07 - been 19 when we were both summer interns
29:09 - at microsoft
29:11 - and scott went on to join apple and has
29:14 - been the inventor and creator of many of
29:16 - the technologies many of us use the most
29:18 - famous of which being the iphone and ios
29:21 - so it's just such an honor to have you
29:23 - uh on to talk to talk to us about your
29:25 - experience learning about computer
29:27 - science and computer programming and so
29:29 - on um before we get into that i wanted
29:31 - to do a very quick trivia question it's
29:33 - trivia time
29:36 - so our trivia question if we're going to
29:38 - put this poll up on screen is the
29:41 - question is what was the very first
29:43 - mouse the first computer mouse made of
29:46 - the options are metal wood and plastic
29:50 - and you can see everybody's making their
29:52 - guesses metal wood or plastic
29:57 - for a computer mouse wow it's kind of a
29:59 - tight vote
30:00 - yeah so we
30:02 - scott do you know the answer yourself
30:05 - uh the first one i ever saw was made of
30:08 - wood
30:10 - all right
30:11 - so let's share the audience results
30:13 - everybody thinks the first computer
30:15 - mouse was made of wood
30:17 - that is not the guess that i would have
30:19 - made
30:20 - but let me share the answer
30:22 - if you see on my screen
30:24 - the very first computer mouse was made
30:27 - of wood and it looks incredibly clunky
30:31 - and you can see this little wheel it
30:32 - could really kind of not go in so many
30:34 - directions um and the reason it was
30:37 - called a mouse this is showing it next
30:38 - to the first one of the first computers
30:40 - and you can see the little string coming
30:43 - out of the back of the mouse mouse's
30:45 - computer mouses were not wireless they
30:47 - used to have a little wire and the wire
30:49 - coming out of the back of it is why we
30:50 - even call it a mouse because it looked a
30:52 - little bit like a mouse
30:53 - uh all right that's it for trivia times
30:56 - so scott i want to talk a little bit
30:57 - about your background um
31:00 - and while scott is talking i also want
31:01 - to share people can at any point if you
31:03 - have questions for scott or myself uh
31:06 - you can go to code.org
31:08 - questions to to submit a question to ask
31:11 - scott at the end of the episode so um
31:14 - the other thing i want to say is while
31:15 - scott and i are chatting i want the
31:18 - students who are on camera those are you
31:19 - on scam camera
31:21 - and if you're at home as well take a
31:23 - piece of paper and sketch out your
31:25 - design for the home screen of a phone of
31:28 - the future so we have somebody who
31:30 - designed the most popular phone that
31:32 - that we're all using the iphone and ios
31:34 - but imagine the phone of the future if
31:36 - you could skip past the idea of a phone
31:39 - with just a bunch of icons of apps and
31:41 - make up your own screen for the home
31:44 - screen on your phone what would it be on
31:46 - later on we're going to share some of
31:47 - these designs with scott and see what he
31:49 - thinks
31:52 - so scott
31:54 - i'd like to hear a little bit about your
31:56 - childhood i know you had some pretty
31:57 - challenging circumstances growing up can
31:59 - you share about basically what it was
32:01 - like growing up how you got into
32:02 - computer science and how that helped you
32:05 - effectively build a better life for
32:06 - yourself yeah definitely um
32:09 - you know when i was a kid uh we moved up
32:12 - to washington
32:14 - and
32:15 - when we got there we didn't have
32:16 - anywhere to live
32:17 - uh and so my
32:20 - my parents found a
32:22 - friend
32:23 - who convinced their neighbor to let us
32:25 - live at their place for a while and when
32:28 - that when that ended and we had to leave
32:32 - we moved into
32:34 - uh
32:34 - a tent in a park
32:37 - and so for a while our family like we
32:38 - were leaving this this tent and i
32:40 - remember we had to
32:42 - uh
32:44 - like walk down the road to the shared
32:45 - bathroom
32:46 - it had a shower and you had to pay for
32:49 - hot water
32:50 - and it cost 25 cents for
32:54 - two minutes of hot water
32:56 - i heard my dad uh declaring that we had
32:59 - enough money for
33:01 - 50 cents per week
33:03 - for my older brother and me to take
33:05 - showers uh so each of us got one quarter
33:08 - uh and could take a two minute hot water
33:10 - shower
33:11 - and the very first time i went down
33:13 - there this is uh up in seattle it's
33:15 - west of seattle it's
33:17 - uh fall so it's really cold
33:20 - i hopped in the shower i'm
33:22 - soaping up two minutes pass really fast
33:26 - when you're a little kid in a shower and
33:27 - suddenly it was
33:29 - ice cold water coming out
33:31 - and and i had soap all over and it was
33:34 - way too cold so i hopped out i dried off
33:36 - and for a week i had just
33:39 - soap drying on me uh
33:42 - which is not great for your skin not
33:44 - great for you at all uh so next week i
33:46 - figured out a better way of doing it
33:47 - which is get a little wet get all the
33:49 - soap on jump in for two minutes to rinse
33:51 - off but let me tell you when when that
33:53 - kind of thing happens
33:55 - it is it is a formative experience
33:58 - uh i said to myself
34:01 - i never want to
34:03 - to reach a point as an adult where i'm
34:05 - living in a tent
34:07 - and so
34:08 - the way
34:09 - to guarantee that was through education
34:12 - like there was no doubt
34:14 - you know i had to go i wanted to
34:16 - concentrate on my education get a great
34:18 - education all through elementary school
34:20 - high school college beyond
34:23 - and that'd be the way out now when i
34:25 - look back on it i think that we probably
34:27 - could have done
34:28 - more than we were doing at the time with
34:30 - my parents and they were very frugal
34:33 - but you know for a for an eight-year-old
34:36 - uh what you see is like you go home from
34:40 - school and you end up in this tent
34:42 - so it's really cool
34:45 - just to imagine i mean right now in
34:46 - america there's millions of people who
34:49 - are homeless and globally hundreds of
34:50 - millions of people who are homeless and
34:53 - especially during this pandemic period
34:55 - when school is closed uh the children
34:57 - don't have a place to go you know
34:59 - there's not a home that they're staying
35:00 - at necessarily
35:02 - and to think that there's
35:03 - eight-year-olds out there right now that
35:05 - might be homeless that one of them might
35:06 - invent the next iphone uh is just an
35:09 - interesting thing to think about and how
35:11 - important
35:12 - education is to give all of them the
35:14 - opportunity to to to basically have a
35:17 - track like unit or just even the
35:18 - opportunity to get a great job right now
35:20 - education is the way and again
35:23 - i
35:24 - i did not have the experience that so
35:25 - many people out there having that are
35:27 - homeless uh
35:28 - and uh
35:31 - and
35:32 - the experience right now with the
35:34 - pandemic which is so difficult where
35:36 - people can't even see their friends in
35:37 - person
35:38 - uh is really really hard and so
35:41 - you know thank goodness for the
35:43 - technology that we've had created over
35:45 - the last five ten years that's made this
35:48 - a little more doable
35:50 - but still uh it is it is very very
35:52 - difficult for people out there
35:54 - and you uh can you tell us a little
35:56 - about you've basically got him to a
35:57 - pretty good college and then got
35:59 - recruited by steve jobs can you tell us
36:00 - about the story about how that happened
36:03 - yeah yeah so so yeah i got into a great
36:06 - college and took out a huge number of
36:08 - loans and i couldn't afford the school
36:10 - without
36:11 - a lot of loans and that i worked the
36:12 - entire time
36:14 - i was in college
36:16 - and when i when i finished my graduate
36:19 - work
36:20 - uh there were two places i was looking i
36:22 - was looking at microsoft where i had
36:24 - been an intern with you and
36:26 - and others
36:27 - and
36:28 - uh at next and next was the computer
36:31 - company that steve jobs had started when
36:33 - he left apple
36:34 - and
36:36 - uh i i was pretty interested in both i
36:38 - mean next i thought had amazing
36:40 - technology uh and amazing people
36:44 - did not have a lot of customers
36:45 - unfortunately but had a great technology
36:47 - so i went to this interview they'd set
36:49 - up and it was an intense interview it
36:51 - was like 17 people throughout the course
36:54 - of an entire day and i was in the very
36:57 - first interview and i was maybe 10
36:59 - minutes into this interview
37:01 - and steve jobs burst into the room and
37:04 - he grabbed the person who was
37:06 - interviewing me and took them out to the
37:08 - hallway which was behind me and they
37:10 - were having this really animated
37:11 - discussion just like talking and
37:15 - something was happening that was big
37:17 - and i was waiting and waiting and
37:19 - waiting for my interview to continue and
37:21 - eventually i heard the door open and my
37:24 - interview came back in
37:27 - but it wasn't the person who had been
37:28 - interviewing me it was it was steve jobs
37:31 - and he just started peppering me with
37:34 - question after question after question
37:37 - and after about 15 minutes we really we
37:39 - really clicked on design
37:42 - philosophy and a bunch of other things
37:45 - he stopped he looked at me and he said
37:49 - i know you have to interview for the
37:50 - rest of the day
37:52 - i don't care what anyone says uh
37:55 - at the end of the day
37:56 - i'm giving you an offer
37:59 - uh
37:59 - and then he said but please you know
38:01 - pretend you're interested in
38:03 - everyone's questions throughout the rest
38:05 - of the day
38:06 - and
38:06 - uh
38:07 - and and then he looked at me and he said
38:09 - and i'm sure you're gonna you're going
38:11 - to accept this offer so this is his way
38:14 - to convince me now
38:16 - i had an offer from microsoft so i
38:17 - called up microsoft or you know one of
38:19 - my contacts there uh and turned down
38:21 - their offer
38:24 - and the next day
38:25 - when i woke up and i opened the door to
38:28 - my apartment
38:29 - there was a box outside i opened it up
38:33 - and it was a dead fish
38:35 - it was this huge dead fish
38:38 - and
38:40 - i looked at the box and had a return
38:42 - address
38:43 - of microsoft
38:47 - this seems like a threat uh i i call i
38:50 - called up my contact at microsoft and i
38:52 - said like
38:53 - uh you know i've watched movies with the
38:56 - mafia
38:57 - and
38:58 - uh i know that when you send someone a
38:59 - dead fish you're trying to to scare them
39:01 - what message are you sending
39:04 - and they said no no no no we
39:07 - we're trying to convince you to come to
39:09 - seattle to microsoft and so the moment
39:12 - you said no
39:13 - we rushed down to the pike place market
39:16 - which is that place in seattle where
39:17 - they throw fish around
39:19 - and they bought the largest king salmon
39:22 - they could find
39:23 - and they packed it in ice and
39:25 - overnighted it to me and so this was to
39:28 - try to convince me
39:29 - i guess that you know there's no fish
39:31 - i'd be able to buy in the bay area uh
39:34 - and to come back to seattle
39:36 - um which is very funny i
39:38 - i cooked the fish that night on a
39:40 - barbecue it was delicious but i ended up
39:42 - going and working with steve jobs for
39:44 - the next 20 years
39:46 - that's awesome
39:47 - well thanks for sharing that story uh
39:49 - it's always amazing to hear about
39:51 - different people's pathways and to to
39:53 - start from a tent to end up working for
39:55 - steve jobs at apple is pretty cool
39:57 - we want to move into the last segment of
40:00 - our episode today which is learning
40:01 - we've been learning about events and we
40:03 - want to learn about using events in apps
40:06 - we're going to do this with my son
40:07 - darius who's going to sit down next to
40:09 - me
40:10 - hi hey darius darius is 13 and he's a
40:13 - big fan of the iphone he has an iphone
40:15 - that he's pretty psyched about uh what
40:17 - we're going to do is we're going to use
40:19 - code.org app lab to design an escape
40:22 - room app and first of all i want to talk
40:25 - about their use of events in in making
40:27 - apps events play a key role for
40:28 - designing user interface when you're
40:30 - designing an app part of the design is
40:32 - the look and feel but actually the more
40:34 - important part is the intro activity
40:36 - anytime a user clicks or types or does
40:38 - anything that generates an event and the
40:41 - interactivity comes from the code that
40:43 - you write to the event handler that
40:44 - manages what happens when that event
40:46 - happens uh while i get open up app lab
40:50 - scott have you done escape rooms before
40:54 - i love escape rooms actually it's one of
40:55 - the things my family is quite addicted
40:57 - to uh we do there's some great ones in
41:00 - san francisco uh palace games is amazing
41:03 - and they even have some online ones and
41:05 - then every time we travel to a given
41:06 - city we find an escape room to do
41:09 - so an escape room for anybody who's not
41:11 - familiar is basically a room that you
41:12 - need to get out of by solving a puzzle
41:15 - we're going to make one of these inside
41:17 - app lab i'm sharing my screen right now
41:19 - and we've actually started this off a
41:21 - little bit to get part of it you know to
41:24 - get the high level design work and then
41:26 - we're going to write some of the code
41:27 - for it so what you see here is a room
41:29 - with a door and a picture and a safe
41:32 - and i'm going to start running it to
41:34 - just see the starter code what it does
41:36 - so if you click run
41:38 - and i'm going to guess that there's
41:39 - something inside the safe so if i click
41:41 - the save you see a prompt that says
41:44 - enter the code but i don't know what
41:46 - code to enter
41:47 - so i'm not sure what's going to happen
41:49 - so we need to write some code here that
41:51 - says on the event that the safe is
41:53 - clicked
41:54 - we're going to
41:55 - prompt the user to enter the code and
41:57 - store that in the variable guess and
41:59 - then here it says if yes equals
42:01 - something we can show the inside of the
42:04 - safe so it's scott what would be a good
42:06 - code for for people to have to guess
42:10 - uh
42:12 - darius's birthday
42:15 - is brilliant during his birthday
42:17 - is that a safe code
42:18 - [Laughter]
42:21 - no let's go
42:22 - uh
42:23 - with uh
42:25 - 1986
42:27 - 9286
42:29 - that's nobody's birthday so now if you
42:31 - type 9286 here's click run
42:38 - oh geez
42:40 - what just happened
42:42 - i think we might have done a reload
42:48 - okay here we go
42:51 - that was lucky um so if we
42:53 - if we click run
42:55 - and if we click the safe it asks for the
42:57 - code and we say 9286
43:00 - and we hit ok it shows the inside of the
43:03 - save
43:04 - that's because this code here that says
43:06 - if the guest was 9286 show the inside of
43:09 - the save
43:10 - but we also want to show something else
43:12 - you can see there there's sort of a
43:13 - hidden key so darius can you pick the
43:15 - show element block it's a little bit
43:18 - farther down over here
43:20 - show element and drag it in there
43:22 - so that in besides showing the inside of
43:25 - the stick we also show
43:27 - the key
43:28 - here yeah
43:29 - now uh when we do that we can click
43:32 - run
43:33 - and then click on the safe and then type
43:36 - 9286
43:38 - and hit ok and that shows the key
43:40 - but how is somebody gonna know that the
43:43 - code is 9286 uh we can hide that code
43:46 - somewhere where would you like to hide
43:47 - it darius under the painting we could
43:50 - put it under the painting so i'm gonna
43:52 - put it behind the painting so i'm going
43:54 - to go in design mode and this is
43:55 - painting is basically an image object
43:58 - if i move it back
43:59 - i can go here
44:01 - and there is going to type the 9286 over
44:04 - here
44:07 - all right so we have that in that little
44:09 - label there but we're going to hide it
44:10 - behind the painting again
44:13 - but then we can write code again for
44:15 - what happens if you click we can unhide
44:17 - the code and we also have this in our
44:19 - starter code so it says on event that
44:20 - the picture is clicked
44:22 - set its position somewhere so do you
44:24 - want to change and pick a new position
44:26 - for the picture when we click it we can
44:28 - change its position the top left will be
44:30 - good all right so you want to pick an x
44:33 - and y
44:34 - 20 and
44:38 - let's try 20 20.
44:41 - and notice when you put your mouse over
44:43 - there on the screen it shows the x and y
44:45 - of different spots if you're not sure
44:48 - so now click the run button
44:51 - and after you click the painting
44:53 - you can see the code 9286 now we can
44:56 - escape the room by using the safe click
44:58 - on the safe
45:00 - and you can enter that code that you got
45:02 - from the painting
45:05 - and now it shows the key and then what
45:07 - happens when we click on the key we need
45:09 - something for that too so now we need an
45:11 - event for what happens when we click the
45:13 - key
45:15 - so
45:16 - to create that event uh go and click and
45:19 - choose another event block at the top
45:21 - you see on event
45:23 - and now we're using events
45:25 - on the event
45:27 - that the key is clicked so
45:30 - choose the key
45:33 - now we want to move the key as well so
45:35 - make another set position block
45:41 - and let's move the key to the let's say
45:44 - to the bottom left of the screen so
45:47 - can you hide around the bottom left of
45:49 - the screen and i want to ask the
45:50 - audience where would it what would be
45:52 - the x and y location
45:54 - for making the bottom of the screen
45:57 - so let's show the poll for the audience
45:59 - to guess that
46:00 - so what should x and y be equal to
46:05 - so we have the options of x of 30 and y
46:07 - of 400
46:09 - x of
46:12 - 400 y of 30
46:15 - x of 30 y of 30 x of 400 y of 400
46:20 - i think the second one might be a typo
46:22 - on our parts
46:26 - all right so if we could share the
46:28 - results of the guesses the most popular
46:30 - guess is x is 30 and y is 400. now this
46:34 - is something i want to share in math
46:35 - class the bottom left would be kind of
46:38 - the small x and a small line when you're
46:40 - looking at computers the x of 0 and y of
46:44 - 0 is of the upper left whereas in math x
46:46 - of 0 and y of 0 is in the bottom left
46:49 - scott do you remember why for computers
46:52 - the y of 0 is at the top and not the
46:54 - bottom
46:56 - uh well turns out it actually depends on
46:58 - the coordinate system of your view
46:59 - system at the time so different ones
47:01 - have different places
47:04 - uh i guess i don't remember the the
47:06 - reason that in general it starts top
47:08 - left yeah so it's actually something
47:10 - whoever makes the operating system can
47:12 - decide so whenever you made ios you
47:14 - chose how that coordinate system would
47:16 - work the historical way reason is
47:18 - because computer screens used to have a
47:20 - sort of cathode ray tube and there was a
47:22 - scan that would actually
47:23 - individually draw the pixels and it
47:25 - would draw them like when you read a
47:27 - book from the top to the bottom and so
47:29 - that was the first why uh so
47:32 - but everybody's guess was right so let's
47:33 - put the key position to go to 30 and 400
47:37 - so when you click the key it's going to
47:39 - move to 30 and 400 and then once the key
47:42 - is out if you look a little bit lower in
47:44 - this code it says if the door is clicked
47:47 - the door doesn't usually open
47:49 - unless the key is in the right spot
47:51 - because if you click on the door it says
47:53 - if the position of the key is something
47:56 - show something so let's set that so that
47:58 - uh
47:59 - if the key is at 30 at the x position is
48:02 - at 30 what should we show
48:04 - click the show element it's got a little
48:06 - drop down there
48:08 - uh let's show the outdoors that'll open
48:10 - the door so if the key has been clicked
48:13 - then we can finally open the door so now
48:15 - let's hit run to see how this works
48:18 - so first you need to
48:19 - click the painting to get our secret
48:21 - code now we got the code we can open the
48:23 - safe by entering
48:25 - 9286.
48:26 - now we got the key click the key all
48:29 - right now that the key is out of the
48:31 - safe we can click to open the door
48:34 - awesome so now we escape the room
48:38 - on this yeah so i have a question so
48:40 - when the the key moves to the bottom
48:43 - and then you have to click the door to
48:46 - open it that seems a little confusing to
48:47 - me
48:48 - uh i mean it seems to me that
48:51 - you want the key when you click on it
48:53 - from the safe to actually open the door
48:55 - you want the action of the key to be to
48:57 - move to the door and open it uh because
48:59 - it doesn't seem
49:01 - we always throw it on the floor and
49:03 - that's how we do it right you
49:05 - trying to pull the key on the floor to
49:06 - open the door isn't that the normal way
49:08 - that's if it's uh you know the kids
49:10 - clothes that they're not putting the
49:12 - hamper
49:14 - so you're saying let's have the key move
49:16 - to the door
49:19 - when you click it yeah i think you can
49:21 - simplify this a lot by moving the key
49:23 - directly to the door
49:25 - all right so let's have the key when you
49:26 - click it set the position
49:34 - and do you want to have to click the
49:35 - door or do you want the door to just
49:36 - automatically open
49:39 - i think you could do either i think you
49:40 - could either have it so when the key
49:42 - goes to the door it opens the door or
49:45 - when the key is on the door now it's
49:46 - unlocked and if you click either the key
49:48 - or the door the door opens
49:51 - right which one do you want to do there
49:52 - is
49:53 - i want to do the way we already have oh
49:56 - yeah less work for outfits to make it
49:58 - the way we already have so click run
50:00 - all right
50:02 - you can't open the door yet try opening
50:04 - the door it doesn't work
50:05 - try opening click the picture
50:08 - you see from using code
50:10 - we know we know the code it's 9286 now
50:13 - click the key
50:14 - and now the key goes to the right place
50:16 - a nicer place and now you can open the
50:18 - door
50:21 - although i'm not sure why it's not
50:22 - working
50:26 - there you go
50:27 - [Music]
50:28 - awesome
50:29 - all right because the key icon is
50:31 - probably larger with alpha yeah the key
50:34 - icon is covering parts of the door so
50:36 - maybe your way would have been better to
50:37 - make the door automatically open up so
50:39 - we're going to share out this app for
50:41 - people to basically make their own
50:43 - escape room app and i want to give an
50:45 - example of something that somebody else
50:46 - made this is a slightly more complicated
50:49 - escape room
50:50 - using very much the same
50:52 - code that we wrote so you can do
50:54 - something more innovative you don't need
50:55 - to use the same code but we are here in
50:57 - a kitchen with a fridge and a microwave
51:00 - and the microwave is asking us for a
51:02 - code uh which we don't know but if you
51:05 - click this little thing it gives you
51:06 - this code of 968692
51:09 - and then i can type this 8692
51:12 - code and the microwave has a key inside
51:16 - and if i click it the fridge opens to
51:18 - show another room
51:19 - and if i click i can go into this other
51:22 - room which in app lab is changing the
51:23 - screen so now there's a door
51:26 - and there's a mat there's nothing under
51:28 - the map there's a safe but i bet i need
51:29 - a code for that if i click the clock
51:32 - it says nope
51:33 - but if i click the code rack it shows me
51:35 - the code
51:36 - 5248 so i can now
51:39 - type that in here 5248 and now i get
51:42 - another key
51:43 - and i click that and it opens the door
51:45 - to get me out so you can make more and
51:47 - more complicated escape rooms if you'd
51:49 - like
51:51 - but that's the challenge that we're
51:52 - going to send you for for after today's
51:54 - code break is done
51:57 - so one thing i want to talk about before
51:59 - we finish you know thank you for helping
52:01 - us with that app
52:02 - scott i wanted to ask a little bit more
52:03 - about the importance of design and
52:05 - asking you a little bit about the
52:06 - initial days of working on the iphone
52:09 - what are the some of the challenges you
52:10 - faced what are some of the design things
52:12 - you needed to get past and and how did
52:14 - you work through them
52:16 - yeah uh when we started the iphone uh we
52:19 - were building something totally
52:20 - different
52:21 - than anything we'd ever seen before and
52:24 - so
52:25 - the important thing about everything we
52:27 - always built at apple is we started with
52:28 - design
52:30 - so we didn't start with technology
52:32 - technology is in service
52:34 - to
52:35 - other things but it is not the end goal
52:38 - and so
52:39 - when we were building the phone uh
52:41 - the biggest design decision we had was
52:45 - making a touch screen which we were
52:47 - already working on a tablet project
52:49 - and so we started using that technology
52:52 - for it but we want to be touch
52:54 - and then there's the question of the
52:56 - keyboard and that was the hardest
52:58 - problem of the entire project is
53:01 - can we make a keyboard that's not
53:04 - physical buttons because at the time
53:06 - all the phones out there had physical
53:08 - buttons right so like the blackberry had
53:10 - these little teeny tiny plastic buttons
53:13 - and that took up half the screen and so
53:16 - you only get another half the screen for
53:18 - you know to see things and half the
53:19 - front of the face of the device is is a
53:22 - keyboard
53:23 - all the time even when you're not using
53:25 - it
53:25 - and so we wanted to make the entire
53:27 - thing
53:28 - into a display but it meant we had to
53:31 - have a keyboard that could work
53:33 - uh and it was unclear if that was
53:35 - possible
53:36 - we we bet on it
53:39 - and
53:40 - you know we're going we're maybe a year
53:42 - into the project
53:44 - and the keyboards weren't working yet
53:46 - uh and this is the important thing like
53:48 - design is about both the the visuals and
53:51 - the usability
53:52 - and so we're about a year in and i
53:54 - paused all work on software on all the
53:57 - applications on all of the designs and
54:00 - we spent 100 of our time just working on
54:03 - keyboards to try to find a solution
54:06 - and
54:07 - uh people came up with crazy design you
54:09 - know sliding designs and and
54:12 - you know pie shape designs uh
54:16 - and
54:18 - some of them worked really well but
54:19 - they'd be incredibly hard to to learn
54:22 - and it's important to know that when
54:24 - you're designing something you might
54:25 - understand it in your head because
54:27 - you've created it
54:28 - but someone else when they're new to it
54:30 - are gonna struggle to understand where
54:33 - you're coming from
54:34 - so we wanted to have something that
54:36 - looked natural and that's why we came up
54:38 - with the standard keyboard and found
54:40 - sort of artificial intelligence ways
54:43 - of having it understand what you meant
54:45 - to type even if your finger didn't touch
54:48 - exactly on that button on the screen
54:51 - so that was
54:53 - one of the biggest risks one of the
54:54 - hardest design things we did that worked
54:57 - out well
54:59 - we also had you know lots of discussions
55:00 - about
55:02 - how many buttons physical buttons should
55:04 - be on the front of the phone and there
55:06 - there's there are arguments for like
55:08 - four buttons three buttons zero buttons
55:11 - uh and we ended up with that one button
55:14 - and the reason was
55:16 - we we didn't want people to be afraid of
55:18 - going into any of the apps
55:21 - and we didn't want them ever to feel
55:22 - like
55:23 - i'm lost i don't know how to get back
55:25 - somewhere and so with a single button
55:27 - it's very easy if you're ever confused
55:30 - if you ever feel
55:31 - uh uneasy you press that button you get
55:34 - back to the home screen it's a known
55:36 - location
55:37 - and you know two-year-olds could figure
55:39 - this out and literally when we shipped
55:41 - it there's two-year-olds using this
55:43 - thing and this was a one-year-old one
55:46 - here
55:47 - there you go one of the earliest photos
55:49 - of him as a one-year-old with the very
55:51 - very first iphone which i bought the
55:52 - very day it came out so yeah
55:55 - can we switch to gallery mode and i want
55:57 - to have the students on screen
55:59 - who drew their own designs for phones to
56:02 - share those and scott if you don't see
56:04 - all these if if you see only me you can
56:06 - click this button
56:08 - in the upper right hand side of zoom i
56:10 - see everyone
56:11 - from folks so you can choose one that
56:13 - you like
56:16 - so pick one of these that you think is
56:18 - uh interesting to talk through and and
56:20 - to to hear from the students
56:24 - i'm trying to see kofi can you hold
56:26 - yours up a little closer
56:32 - and you can move the right and left
56:34 - buttons to see more examples from other
56:36 - folks as well uh
56:37 - i'm going to suggest nick and reim
56:39 - because that's a really cool yeah the
56:41 - nikkei marine it has lots of color and
56:43 - so yeah let's let's see theirs
56:46 - can we um mute and have you show us your
56:47 - design and talk us through what you made
56:50 - and can we switch to speaker view
56:54 - i'll go first um
56:55 - so pretty much my phone design what i
56:58 - made it was it was um like uh poly glass
57:01 - so like plastic glass
57:03 - and it would all this the whole screen
57:05 - would be see-through
57:07 - and these two parts these two components
57:09 - would be metal and they would project
57:10 - onto the glass and then i sort of had
57:13 - all the apps i had the main apps that
57:15 - you use the most are your like favorite
57:17 - apps bigger than all the rest
57:20 - and then
57:21 - yeah the battery would be at the bottom
57:23 - here
57:24 - and what else and then the
57:26 - banner for your notifications would be
57:28 - at the bottom and then you have the home
57:30 - screen sliding up sort of like the
57:31 - iphone
57:32 - x and the iphone 11
57:35 - you would slide up you've designed not
57:37 - just a home screen but an entire new
57:39 - phone there
57:41 - you have the charging mechanism and
57:42 - everything
57:44 - that's great
57:45 - and did your sister make a design too
57:47 - where are you all calling from by the
57:48 - way
57:49 - uh calgary canada you got it
57:54 - honestly i just liked mythical unicorns
57:57 - so i made a phone just for girls
57:59 - [Laughter]
58:03 - all right that's the one one thing that
58:04 - i like about that one thing people
58:06 - forget when doing design is to make it
58:09 - actually fun and engaging
58:12 - too often things become very perfunctory
58:15 - and very boring and so designing
58:17 - something that is both fun to use
58:20 - and approachable and accessible is a
58:23 - is a great uh design point
58:28 - all right well what i'd love to do is to
58:30 - have the audience if anybody submitted
58:32 - questions for scott
58:34 - akira do we have any questions from the
58:36 - audience that we can ask of scots
58:39 - hello yes we do
58:41 - um so we have a handful of questions
58:43 - today actually one for scott and one for
58:45 - hottie so um scott we have austin c from
58:48 - mountain view california
58:50 - and he said how have the liberal and or
58:52 - creative arts influenced how you think
58:54 - about coding and computer science
58:56 - oh that's a fantastic question uh
58:59 - i
59:00 - i think that the liberal arts are
59:02 - critical to designing anything i mean
59:06 - apple we always talked about sitting at
59:07 - the intersection of engineering and the
59:10 - liberal arts
59:11 - i mean i personally
59:13 - uh have been producing broadway musicals
59:16 - as well i mean i i think that
59:18 - that when you bring that creativity in
59:21 - everything you do
59:22 - when you're
59:23 - building uh an application is design
59:27 - work
59:28 - and be it design your code to designing
59:31 - the user experience to designing the
59:35 - interactivity it's it's all design and
59:38 - so
59:39 - the more versed you are
59:41 - in the liberal arts the better read you
59:44 - are the more you know plays you've seen
59:46 - in books you've read
59:48 - the better
59:50 - equipped you are
59:52 - to build more interesting
59:54 - products and also the better equipped
59:56 - you are to understand
59:58 - more cultures
60:00 - and since we live in this very
60:01 - interconnected global community now uh
60:05 - by understanding different cultures
60:07 - different from your own you can build
60:08 - products that will work better for
60:11 - people that are unlike you
60:15 - and one thing by the way in today's day
60:16 - and age of artificial intelligence and
60:18 - machine learning
60:19 - the importance of learning liberal arts
60:21 - and humanities is not only for the
60:22 - design but also for the ethics of how
60:26 - your code is being used and how it's
60:27 - going to impact society at a grander
60:29 - scale because some of the technologies
60:31 - coming out are really changing society
60:33 - yeah and i think it's critical for all
60:35 - of us who are building these products to
60:37 - consider ethics with every decision
60:40 - all right cure did you have another
60:42 - question
60:43 - uh yes the last one was for you hadi um
60:46 - so we have it from akshata in bengaluru
60:48 - in india and they said i want to help my
60:51 - people in schools and in my country
60:53 - learn computer science what can i do to
60:55 - help them i'm not sure what age they are
60:56 - but what general advice do you have
60:59 - that's a wonderful question well if they
61:01 - have
61:02 - internet connectivity whether on mobile
61:04 - phones or on computers you can use the
61:06 - courses at code.org and if you visit
61:09 - code.org there's a button called teach
61:11 - which is for people who want to be
61:12 - teachers and we've designed that mostly
61:14 - for people in regular schools but people
61:17 - are using the code.org courses in after
61:19 - schools or home schools or basically
61:22 - making their own student clubs uh if if
61:25 - this is for students who don't have
61:26 - computers there's actually unplugged
61:29 - activities a lot like what we did with
61:31 - with ben hagerty with macklemore earlier
61:33 - making the dance moves there's all sorts
61:36 - of unplugged activities that that people
61:38 - can do
61:39 - and those are also you look for the
61:41 - unplugged course it teaches basic
61:43 - computer concepts like uh events like
61:46 - loops like algorithms in an unplugged
61:49 - manner and you can use those in your
61:50 - community there's over a million
61:53 - teachers around the world teaching using
61:55 - code.org
61:56 - classrooms and you can become a young
61:58 - teacher in india or anywhere you want
62:00 - yeah and let me put a plug in i've
62:03 - actually used the code.org materials to
62:06 - teach at boys and girls clubs before
62:09 - and the materials are fantastic and
62:12 - right now when people are sheltering at
62:14 - home
62:15 - is a perfect time to learn computer
62:18 - science it is a perfect time
62:20 - it's such a great thing to learn while
62:22 - you're at home uh so we're wrapping up
62:25 - our episode uh and one thing i want to
62:27 - say is if you want to continue your
62:28 - learning we're going to email you this
62:30 - week's challenges if you aren't on our
62:32 - email list go to code.org break and sign
62:35 - up and we'll send you the code for to
62:38 - basically learn to make your own dance
62:39 - party or to make your own escape room
62:41 - app uh if you want to come back on next
62:44 - week to share what you've created you
62:46 - can have your mom and dad share what you
62:48 - create on social media with hashtag
62:50 - codebreak or you can email them to us
62:52 - directly
62:53 - and
62:54 - also the thing i want to say is these
62:56 - challenges always include an aspect that
62:58 - can be done on a smartphone if you don't
63:00 - have a computer or even without a device
63:02 - and lastly don't forget to go to
63:04 - code.org shop to get either a cool hat
63:07 - or t-shirt like word we're wearing so
63:09 - thank you scott so much for being this
