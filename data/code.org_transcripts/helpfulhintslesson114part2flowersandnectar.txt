00:00 - if you're having a hard time writing the
00:02 - code for this problem take a look at
00:04 - what we need to do and let's figure out
00:06 - how to translate it into blocks
00:08 - the first thing we need to do is move
00:10 - forward so i'll drag the move forward
00:12 - block underneath when run
00:14 - after that we need to check to see if
00:16 - there's a flower underneath the cloud
00:19 - how do we do that
00:21 - we use this block if at flower
00:24 - that says if you're at a flower run the
00:27 - code inside of this block
00:30 - but what code needs to go inside of that
00:32 - block what are we going to do if we're
00:35 - at a flower
00:37 - that's right get nectar one time
00:41 - so now the code here will have us move
00:43 - forward
00:45 - check that first cloud and if there is
00:47 - you'll get nectar
00:49 - you can see that the b correctly moved
00:52 - forward saw that there was a flower and
00:54 - got nectar but now we still have six
00:57 - more spaces to check i'll let you figure
01:00 - out how to do that on your own happy
01:02 - coding
