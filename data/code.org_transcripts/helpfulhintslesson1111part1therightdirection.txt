00:00 - congratulations for wanting to solve the
00:02 - challenge puzzle
00:03 - it's really difficult but that's okay
00:06 - it's supposed to be hard
00:08 - and the first thing you want to do when
00:09 - you face any difficult problem is to
00:12 - understand what you're trying to do in
00:16 - this puzzle you might think you want to
00:18 - creep forward and check this first cloud
00:21 - and then continue on
00:23 - but the real trick here is understanding
00:25 - that sometimes it's quicker to come back
00:28 - to something so for this puzzle
00:31 - think about moving all the way to the
00:34 - end of the path
00:35 - and addressing this cloud before turning
00:38 - and doing this path turning and doing
00:41 - this path and then turning and doing the
00:45 - final path i think that will set you in
00:47 - the right direction
00:49 - happy coding
