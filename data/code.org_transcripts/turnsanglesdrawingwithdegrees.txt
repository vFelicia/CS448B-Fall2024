00:04 - Hey what's up with angles on code.org? In
school I learned that you can make an
00:11 - equilateral triangle with just three 60
degree angles. But on Code.org,
00:16 - I need to make turns of 120 degrees. Why
is that? When you measure angles in
00:23 - school, you're usually measuring along the inside of the shape.
00:26 - In Code.org the
artist turns along the outside of the
00:32 - shape when you draw a line. If the artist
makes no turn, he draws a 180 degree
00:39 - angle. If you want an angle in your shape
that's less than 180 degrees, then you
00:46 - need to make your artist turn. If you
want to make a shape with a 60 degree
00:51 - angle, then your artist needs to turn 120
degrees. That's because 120 plus 60
01:00 - equals 180. Maybe you want to draw a
square or a rectangle. In that case,
01:07 - you're gonna need a 90 degree angle. A 90
degree angle cuts a hundred and eighty
01:12 - degrees right in half,
meaning you'll need a 90 degree turn for
01:17 - your 90 degree angle. What do you do if
you want your artist to turn around and
01:22 - come back right it came? In that
case, you'll want to make a 180 degree
01:29 - turn.
That'll flip your artist right around
01:32 - and send it back in the opposite
direction.
01:35 - Fun fact:whether you turn right by 180 degrees, or left
01:41 - by 180 degrees, you will end
up in the exact same place. Today we
01:48 - talked about a bunch of angles that
you'll have the opportunity to play with
01:51 - on Code.org, but there are so many more.
Hop online and try them for yourself!
01:57 - Have fun coding!
