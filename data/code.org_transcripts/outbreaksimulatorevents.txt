00:00 - Now let's learn about a programming concept
called Events.
00:04 - An event tells your program to listen for
something to happen, and then react right away.
00:10 - Some examples of events are: listening for
a mouse click, an arrow button press, 
00:16 - or atap on the screen.
00:18 - We use events all the time as humans, when
we respond to different signals.
00:23 - When I'm walking down the street, and see
someone else walking towards me, I check to
00:27 - make sure I'm wearing my mask correctly.
00:31 - When we develop a simulation, we create a
series of rules.
00:35 - For this simulation, we'll code this rule:
When a healthy monster touches a sick monster,
00:41 - the healthy monster will become sick.
00:43 - Here is a "when touches" event.
00:47 - Click the small blue plus sign here, on this
block.
00:51 - It will show 2 new blocks called Subject,
and Object.
00:55 - Drag the purple monster block, into the code
below it.
00:59 - This code is telling the computer that when
a healthy monster meets a sick monster, the
01:03 - healthy monster will change its costume, to
look like a sick monster.
01:08 - Click "run" to watch your simulation play
out.
01:12 - Run your program a few times, and observe
the differences.
