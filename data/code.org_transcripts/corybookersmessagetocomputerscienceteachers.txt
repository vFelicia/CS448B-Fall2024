00:00 - so my hope is that when i come back out
00:02 - here
00:03 - uh not next year but maybe two years
00:05 - from now that that um i that we've done
00:09 - some things to
00:10 - make this movement more viral and make
00:12 - it easier for teachers because i think
00:14 - you guys were the ones that gave me the
00:16 - stats about how few kids in my state
00:18 - even take the computer science ap course
00:20 - i was shocked that that how few people
00:23 - are even doing that and and so

00:28 - begin to celebrate those successes
