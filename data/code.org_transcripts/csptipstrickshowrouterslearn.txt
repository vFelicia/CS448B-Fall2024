00:04 - this lesson serves as the last lesson in
00:06 - a short series of unplugged activities
00:08 - focusing on the big ideas of algorithms
00:11 - and the internet
00:12 - this lesson connects back to the
00:14 - internet by showing how routers on the
00:15 - internet learn about the best ways to
00:17 - route traffic
00:19 - in previous lessons where students
00:20 - considered shortest path algorithms they
00:22 - could see the entire graph and consider
00:24 - it when tracing through the shortest
00:26 - path algorithm
00:27 - but the internet is huge it's impossible
00:29 - for one router a computer to actually
00:32 - keep track of every possible path to
00:34 - every possible location
00:36 - also the internet changes over time
00:38 - computers and routers join up wires get
00:40 - accidentally severed and routers get
00:42 - hacked or attacked
00:45 - routers are supposed to route traffic as
00:46 - efficiently as possible but they can't
00:48 - possibly keep track of such a large
00:50 - fluctuating network
00:52 - so the big question of the lesson is how
00:54 - do routers actually learn what the best
00:56 - ways to route traffic are how can they
00:58 - recover if a known path goes down
01:01 - this lesson gives students acting as
01:03 - individual routers an interesting view
01:05 - into an algorithm for calculating and
01:07 - updating the best paths through the
01:08 - internet
01:10 - not all routers on the internet are
01:11 - directly connected to each other
01:14 - the way routers keep track of paths
01:15 - through the internet is actually not by
01:17 - keeping track of the whole path at all
01:19 - rather routers keep track of the cost of
01:22 - routing traffic through other
01:23 - neighboring routers to which it's
01:25 - connected
01:27 - but what is meant by cost cost can mean
01:29 - a lot of things when talking about the
01:31 - internet time speed reliability money
01:35 - usually it means time it's a measure of
01:37 - the bit rate between routers and the
01:39 - total cumulative time it takes for a
01:40 - packet hopping from one router to
01:43 - another to get from one place to its
01:45 - destination
01:46 - time can be affected by the connection
01:48 - speed and also by the volume of traffic
01:51 - on the internet
01:52 - when a router joins a network it might
01:54 - initially know the costs of the
01:56 - connections to the routers to which it
01:58 - is directly connected
01:59 - that router can then exchange
02:01 - information about the costs of its
02:03 - connections with other routers that are
02:04 - directly connected to it
02:07 - during this exchange a router might
02:08 - realize that if it routes packets
02:10 - through that neighbor those packets can
02:12 - reach yet other routers that they
02:14 - couldn't before
02:16 - the total cost of routing traffic
02:18 - through the neighbor is the cost of the
02:20 - direct connection plus the cost reported
02:22 - by the neighbor to get to the
02:24 - destination
02:26 - over time the cost of connections might
02:28 - change or newer better paths might be
02:30 - realized and routers constantly update
02:32 - their internal tables to reflect the
02:34 - most recent and best information
02:37 - each router keeps track of multiple
02:39 - paths to various points by keeping track
02:42 - of the cost of routing traffic through
02:43 - its directly connected neighbors
02:46 - the algorithm that each router runs is
02:48 - relatively simple but since every router
02:51 - is doing it the algorithm is effectively
02:53 - distributed and it seems like all the
02:55 - routers on the internet are constantly
02:57 - learning
02:58 - in the activity students each act as the
03:00 - router exchanging information with other
03:02 - routers on the internet
03:04 - which we represent as a small network of
03:06 - eight routers
03:08 - today
03:09 - you are each going to be routers
03:12 - and learn about how routers learn about
03:14 - the shortest path to other
03:16 - routers on the internet
03:18 - each student is connected to three other
03:20 - classmates with whom they can exchange
03:22 - information and initially only knows
03:24 - about the cost to these directly
03:26 - connected neighbors
03:28 - students as routers exchange information
03:30 - about routing costs with their neighbors
03:32 - and record this information in their own
03:34 - personal routing table
03:36 - over time each student's routers table
03:39 - will grow and show the cost of routing
03:42 - traffic through each of their neighbors
03:43 - to every other possible router in the
03:45 - small network
03:47 - to make this run smoothly with your
03:49 - students we have a few tips
03:51 - put eight students in a circle around a
03:54 - table is just fine and hand out the
03:55 - worksheets in alphabetical order a
03:57 - through h around the circle with this
04:00 - sticky note on it just put it somewhere
04:02 - visible you can put it on your head you
04:03 - can put it on your shirt but make sure
04:05 - that everybody else at the table can see
04:07 - what your router
04:08 - is and i'm passing these out in order
04:11 - if your class size isn't divisible by 8
04:13 - then create groups so that each one has
04:16 - as many students as possible so two
04:18 - groups of seven are preferable to one of
04:20 - eight and another of six
04:23 - distribute the worksheets alphabetically
04:24 - around the circle and place any
04:26 - remaining worksheets in the circle as if
04:28 - they were students or routers in their
04:30 - place
04:31 - these ones are considered dumb routers
04:33 - gee okay and this dumb router here is h
04:37 - students can consult the sheet
04:39 - but the dumb routers table will never
04:41 - change
04:42 - so hand these out these are the
04:44 - instructions
04:46 - what i want you to do is take just a
04:47 - couple minutes
04:49 - and read the instructions on the handout
04:52 - have students note that they are
04:53 - connected to the person on either side
04:55 - of them and then someone across the
04:57 - table and that these are the only three
04:59 - people they should talk to
05:01 - each of you are only connected to three
05:03 - other routers at this table you are
05:05 - connected to your elbow partners and you
05:07 - are connected to one person across the
05:09 - way so can you guys point
05:12 - it's important during the lesson that
05:13 - students only talk to and exchange
05:15 - information with the students they're
05:16 - connected to
05:17 - what we're going to be doing is
05:19 - trying to find
05:21 - the cheapest cost
05:23 - so what these numbers on the wires are
05:25 - is the cost to get from from one node to
05:28 - another it's helpful to walk through the
05:31 - examples on the worksheet with your
05:32 - students that demonstrate how to
05:34 - calculate the cost of a path based on an
05:36 - information exchange
05:39 - i asked b hey can you get to d
05:41 - and b said yep with a cost of 8 which
05:44 - means that through b i can get to d
05:47 - in a cost of 10 because it takes 2 and
05:49 - then 8. but i already have a direct
05:52 - connection to d
05:53 - of four so i note that down that i can
05:56 - get to d through b with a cost of ten
05:59 - total so i now have two known paths to d
06:02 - so we're gonna spend two minutes pick
06:04 - one router that you are connected to
06:07 - and exchange information with it you'll
06:09 - be filling out the column
06:11 - of that router that you are speaking
06:14 - with at that time you might want to
06:15 - start the information exchange in timed
06:17 - rounds being clear that each round they
06:20 - should talk to one of their directly
06:22 - connected neighbors
06:23 - a pair of students will need two to
06:25 - three minutes to trade information but
06:27 - will get much faster with each
06:28 - subsequent round
06:30 - make sure that during each round every
06:31 - student is exchanging information with a
06:33 - neighbor even if it's a dumb router
06:35 - no student should be sitting or doing
06:37 - nothing for any given round
06:39 - do you have a connection to d
06:42 - yes how much is that it's five five okay
06:46 - what's your best connection to g my best
06:48 - connection to g is direct and it's eight
06:51 - so now that you've gotten the hang of it
06:53 - and talked to one partner i'm now going
06:54 - to open it up you can talk to any of
06:56 - your three partners still only your
06:58 - three partners but you can go back and
07:00 - forth and exchange information with any
07:03 - of them you may want to go back to a
07:05 - previous partner because they may have
07:07 - found
07:08 - some new information
07:10 - in this activity even if students don't
07:12 - calculate the cost completely correctly
07:14 - it's okay the main ideas of the activity
07:16 - will still come through
07:18 - students will still see that each router
07:20 - can learn about the network by talking
07:22 - to only a few other routers and that
07:24 - there are multiple paths with different
07:26 - costs to every
07:28 - destination after a few rounds of
07:30 - exchanging information groups look at
07:32 - the big picture by drawing what they
07:34 - know about the network on a poster
07:36 - so you can ask groups to try to trace a
07:38 - route between some starting and ending
07:40 - points by asking each subsequent router
07:42 - along the way to say which neighbor they
07:44 - would forward a packet to to reach the
07:46 - destination
07:48 - if i know that my
07:50 - lowest cost route is through f to get to
07:52 - c do i have to go e to f to c start
07:56 - outside directly
07:58 - uh you only have wires connecting you to
08:01 - these two so we should start out by just
08:03 - drawing the ones that you're connecting
08:05 - to
08:06 - when our direct connection between us is
08:09 - eight but we got a much smaller number
08:12 - yeah so can we see how that worked
08:14 - because i was able to from
08:16 - from f i was able to go get a short a
08:19 - smaller number from e
08:20 - because that was a connection
08:22 - right so my connection to g is from e to
08:27 - h which is one and then from h to g
08:30 - which is two so if you go to me for one
08:32 - that's a total of four
08:36 - unlike the previous shortest path
08:37 - algorithm activities it is impossible to
08:40 - trace a definitive shortest path on the
08:42 - graph because each router is its own
08:44 - starting point and views the network
08:46 - differently
08:48 - it is also important to discuss why a
08:50 - router keeps track of more than one path
08:52 - to a destination rather than just the
08:54 - shortest one
08:55 - prompt your students with a question
08:57 - such as what if the link between a and b
08:59 - goes down or gets eaten by a raccoon how
09:02 - would that affect traffic in the network
