00:00 - Hi everyone,
00:01 - One of the most exiting things of a program 
is that it can be interactive.
00:06 - Any time someone clicks, tabs or types something at a computer or phone, that generates a event.
00:12 - and there is some code that decides what to do when an event occurs.
00:16 - For example, you could have an eventhandler that sais
00:20 - "when the mouse is clicked, play a sound".
00:23 - Let's try an activity to see how it works.
00:25 - Have you ever heard of the game Flappy Bird?
00:28 - By using eventhandlers, you can learn how to program 
your very own custom version of Flappy Bird.
00:34 - The code you write involves dragging and dropping blocks, 
that represents commands for the computer.
00:40 - Drag and drop programming is the easiest way to learn...
00:44 - It's even how university students learn how to code.
00:47 - But under the hood, each block is represented by real code.
00:51 - If you take a look at the workspace, there are some green blocks that are filled in for you.
00:56 - These are event handlers.
00:57 - If you want the bird to flap, when you click your mouse, you can do this by attaching the flap-block to the appropriate eventhandler.
01:04 - And now in your game, whenever you click your mouse, the bird will flap.
01:08 - In each puzzle of this activity, we will introduce new types of events as green blocks on the work space.
01:15 - and you can decide the appropriate block to add in responds of these events.
01:19 - When you see a arrow like this, you can change the settings,
01:23 - like the sound to play when the bird touches the ground.
01:26 - In the final puzzle, you will be able to create your own game and share it with your friends.
01:31 - Have fun!
