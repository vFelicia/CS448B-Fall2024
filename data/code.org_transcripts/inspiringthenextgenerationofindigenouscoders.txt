00:00 - my name is elizabeth holm i'm the
00:02 - founder of sonak which is the sisterhood
00:04 - of native american coders essentially we
00:06 - teach indigenous girls around the
00:08 - country how to code through an entirely
00:10 - online program that kind of connects
00:12 - nine to 12 year old girls from many
00:14 - different native communities around the
00:16 - country what we're really trying to do
00:18 - is spark their stem interest at a young
00:20 - age so that they can kind of carry that
00:22 - on with them and also inspire girls
00:25 - around them
00:26 - to do the same to kind of pursue stem
00:29 - and try out this new potentially scary
00:31 - thing
00:32 - i think we can start a chain of kind of
00:34 - the next generation of um indigenous
00:37 - female innovators in stem and hopefully
00:39 - really up that uh the representation
00:41 - that we have um in the stem field
