00:07 - AI and Machine Learning can affect every
part of society.
00:11 - For instance self-driving cars use AI
to recognize their surroundings,
00:16 - track objects,
00:17 - and make super important
decisions like when to stop.
00:23 - Machine Learning is already being used in some really amazing things.
00:27 - It's allowing us to be more energy efficient.
00:31 - We use it to improve how we grow food and manage natural resources.
00:35 - It's dramatically changing how we diagnose diseases
00:39 - and create new medicines.
00:41 - It's even helping the blind see.
00:45 - AI Voice: "I think it's a man jumping in the air doing a trick on a skateboard."
00:51 - But there are also risks.
00:53 - Consider the potential impact when machine learning
00:56 - is used to evaluate candidates for college admission,
00:59 - screen applicants for bank loans,
01:02 - or even predict crime or spot criminals.
01:05 - When using machine learning in these types of applications
01:09 - we need to make sure not to use prejudiced training data
01:12 - that would perpetuate human bias.
01:16 - As AI and Machine Learning change
everything
01:19 - it's important that you have a hand and how they're being used.
01:23 - More than any other technology,
01:25 - AI has the potential to revolutionize our lives for the better
01:29 - so long as it's done in a way that avoids bias
01:32 - that could cause harm or inequity.
01:34 - The most important thing about machine learning is human learning.
01:38 - Knowing how this technology works is the first step on your journey to using it for good.
