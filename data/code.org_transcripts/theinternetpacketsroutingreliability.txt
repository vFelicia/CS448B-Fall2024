00:06 - Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one [Music] 
Hi, my name is Lynn Root. I am a software engineer  
00:11 - here at Spotify and I’ll be the first to 
admit that I often take for granted the  
00:14 - reliability of the internet. 
The sheer amount of information  
00:18 - zooming around the internet is astonishing. 
But how is it possible for every piece of  
00:23 - data to be delivered to you reliably? 
Say you want to play a song from Spotify.  
00:28 - It seems like your computer connects directly to 
Spotify servers and Spotify sends you a song on  
00:33 - a direct, dedicated line. But actually, 
that’s not how the internet works. 
 
00:38 - If the internet were made of direct, dedicated 
connections it would be impossible to keep  
00:43 - things working as millions of users join, 
especially since there is no guarantee that  
00:47 - every wire and computer is working all 
the time. Instead, data travels on the  
00:52 - internet in a much less direct fashion. 
Many, many years ago in the early 1970s,  
00:58 - my partner Bob Khan and I began working on 
the design of what we now call the internet. 
 
01:04 - Bob and I had the responsibility and the 
opportunity to design the internet’s protocols and  
01:11 - its architecture. So, we persisted in 
participating in the internet’s growth  
01:16 - and evolution for all of this time, 
up to and including the present. 
 
01:21 - The way information gets transferred from one 
computer to another is pretty interesting.  
01:27 - It need not follow a fixed path. In 
fact, your path may change in the midst  
01:31 - of a computer-to-computer conversation. 
Information on the internet goes from one  
01:36 - computer to another in what we call a packet of 
information. And a packet travels from one place  
01:42 - to another on the internet a lot like how you 
might get from one place to another in a car.  
01:47 - Depending on traffic congestion or road 
conditions you might choose or be forced to take  
01:52 - a different route to get to the 
same place each time you travel. 
 
01:58 - And just as you can transport 
all sorts of stuff inside a car,  
02:02 - many kinds of digital information can be sent 
with IP packets, but there are some limits.
 
02:08 - What if, for example, you need to move a 
space shuttle from where it was built to  
02:12 - where it will be launched. The shuttle won’t 
fit in one truck so it needs to be broken down  
02:16 - into pieces and transported using a fleet of 
trucks. They could all take different routes  
02:21 - and might get to the destination at different 
times, but once all the pieces are there  
02:25 - you can reassemble the pieces 
into the complete shuttle,  
02:28 - and it’ll be ready for launch. 
On the internet, the details work  
02:33 - similarly. If you have a very large image that you 
want to send to a friend or upload to a website,  
02:39 - that image might be made up of tens 
of millions of bits or ones and zeros,  
02:43 - too many to send along in one packet. Since 
it’s data on a computer, the computer sending  
02:48 - the image can quickly break it into hundreds or 
even thousands of smaller parts, called packets. 
 
02:54 - Unlike cars or trucks, these packets don’t 
have drivers and they don’t choose their route.  
02:59 - Each packet has the internet address of 
where it came from and where it’s going.  
03:03 - Special computers on the internet, called 
routers, act like traffic managers to keep  
03:07 - the packets moving through the networks smoothly. 
If one route is congested, individual packets may  
03:14 - travel different routes through the internet 
and they may arrive at the destination at  
03:18 - slightly different times, or even out of order. 
So let’s talk about how this works. As part of  
03:25 - the Internet Protocol, every router keeps track of 
multiple paths for sending packets, and it chooses  
03:30 - the cheapest available path for each piece of data 
based on destination IP address for the packet. 
 
03:36 - Cheapest in this case doesn’t mean cost 
but time and nontechnical factors such as  
03:41 - politics and relationships between companies. 
Often the best route for data to travel isn’t  
03:46 - necessarily the most direct. Having options 
for paths makes the network fault tolerant,  
03:52 - which means the network can keep sending packets 
even if something goes horribly, horribly wrong.
 
03:57 - This is the basis for a key principle 
of the internet: reliability. 
 
04:03 - Now, what if you want to request some 
data and not everything is delivered?  
04:07 - Say you want to listen to a song. 
How can you be 100 percent sure  
04:11 - all the data will be delivered 
so the song plays perfectly?
 
04:14 - Introducing your new best friend, TCP 
(Transmission Control Protocol). TCP manages the  
04:21 - sending and receiving of all your data as packets. 
Think of it like a guaranteed mail service. 
 
04:26 - When you request a song on your device, Spotify 
sends a song broken up into many packets. 
 
04:32 - When your packets arrive, TCP does a full 
inventory and sends back acknowledgments of each  
04:37 - packet received. If all packets are there, TCP 
signs for your delivery and you’re done. [Music] 
 
04:50 - If TCP finds some packets are missing, it won’t 
sign. Otherwise, your song wouldn’t sound as good,  
04:56 - or portions of the song could be missing. For 
each missing or incomplete packet, Spotify will  
05:01 - resend them. Once TCP verifies the delivery 
of many packets for that one song request,  
05:07 - your song will start to play. [Music]
What’s great about the TCP and router  
05:13 - systems is they’re scalable. They can work 
with eight devices or eight billion devices. 
 
05:18 - In fact, because of these principles of fault 
tolerance and redundancy, the more routers we add,  
05:23 - the more reliable the internet becomes. 
What’s also great is we can grow and  
05:27 - scale the internet without interrupting 
service for anybody using it. [Music] 
 
05:31 - The internet is made of hundreds of thousands of 
networks and billions of computers and devices  
05:36 - connected physically. These different systems 
that make up the internet connect to each other,  
05:42 - communicate with each other, and work together 
because of agreed-upon standards for how data  
05:48 - is sent around on the internet. 
Computing devices or routers along  
05:53 - the internet help all the packets make 
their way to the destination, where  
05:57 - they’re reassembled, if necessary, in order. 
This happens billions of times a day, whether  
06:04 - you and others are sending an email, visiting a 
web page, doing a video chat, using a mobile app,  
06:11 - or when sensors or devices on 
the internet talk to each other.
