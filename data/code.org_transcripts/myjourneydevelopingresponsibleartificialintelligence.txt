00:21 - hello everyone my name is leoland bowen
00:24 - and i work on the educations programs
00:26 - team here at code.org
00:28 - thank you for joining us for our first
00:30 - my journey class chat and thank you
00:33 - taylor roper who is joining us from
00:34 - google hey taylor
00:39 - so
00:40 - taylor my first question is for you and
00:42 - for those watching at home or in your
00:44 - class please feel free to answer this
00:46 - question as well out loud or put it in
00:47 - the chat box
00:49 - taylor if you were an ice cream flavor
00:51 - what flavor would you be
00:55 - that's a great question
00:58 - um
01:00 - i think i would be vanilla with a
01:03 - caramel swirl
01:05 - um because vanilla is very versatile you
01:08 - can put it with a lot of other different
01:09 - flavors but it's also really simple
01:12 - and like
01:13 - classy in its own sense
01:16 - um and then the caramel swirl adds a
01:18 - little razzle dazzle adds a little fun
01:20 - to the mix
01:21 - and adds like a really nice additional
01:23 - flavor
01:25 - i love it that sounds great
01:27 - yummy
01:29 - thank you first thing i want to think
01:30 - about in the morning is ice cream
01:32 - yes
01:34 - so taylor tell us about your work what
01:36 - do you do
01:37 - [Music]
01:38 - yes so i'm a program manager and so
01:41 - essentially what that means if i solve
01:43 - business problems
01:45 - and i know that can sound really really
01:47 - big and vague
01:48 - but
01:49 - it's what we do and it can be any kind
01:52 - of problem so if my team is having a
01:53 - problem with communicating with others i
01:56 - might create a newsletter or
01:58 - if there's a program that needs to be
01:59 - run i might manage having to schedule
02:01 - meetings or
02:03 - talk to people or take notes or create
02:06 - documents that help people understand
02:08 - what the project is about
02:10 - um and program managers can sit on a
02:13 - variety of different products so if
02:14 - you've ever heard of google search or
02:16 - google pixel or youtube there are
02:18 - definitely program managers like myself
02:21 - working on those products to help make
02:23 - them better efficient and more helpful
02:26 - to users
02:29 - that sounds so fun um
02:31 - can you tell us
02:33 - a little bit more about specifically
02:35 - what a.i is and how does that work help
02:38 - your community
02:40 - yeah so hopefully no computer scientists
02:43 - watch this and like she got it wrong but
02:45 - essentially
02:46 - artificial intelligence from my
02:48 - perspective is when we give technology
02:53 - or computers the ability to do tasks
02:56 - like humans so like us
02:58 - um and also make decisions
03:00 - and i think the decision-making part
03:02 - where
03:03 - a computer can say
03:05 - is this a cat or a dog and it says yes
03:08 - and then it does something else with it
03:10 - is what makes artificial intelligence
03:12 - artificial intelligence and how it helps
03:15 - um
03:16 - my community is that it just makes a lot
03:19 - of different things easier i mean there
03:22 - are disabled people in my community who
03:24 - are able to use things like the lookout
03:26 - app
03:27 - which helps identify helps people who
03:29 - have vision
03:30 - disabilities identify different objects
03:32 - around them
03:34 - you have google translate which allows
03:37 - people who may have a language barrier
03:39 - to communicate via technology
03:42 - you have google search which gives
03:44 - people an access to a whole lot of
03:46 - information that
03:48 - decades ago was not available to a lot
03:50 - of people my parents always talk about
03:51 - how
03:52 - i use google maps and they don't
03:54 - understand
03:55 - how i would navigate in the world if i
03:57 - didn't have google maps right so all of
03:59 - these different artificial intelligence
04:01 - technologies are really helpful for
04:03 - people and really help people
04:06 - really make tasks that people deal with
04:08 - on a day-to-day basis easier
04:11 - i love google maps as well in the same
04:14 - way just i just give me the address and
04:16 - google maps will tell me and tell me how
04:18 - to get there
04:20 - exactly my mom's like i don't know how
04:21 - you would survive in this world you
04:22 - don't know any streets i'm like i have
04:24 - my phone
04:25 - right that's all you need
04:29 - so um
04:31 - what do you really really enjoy about
04:33 - working for google and being a program
04:35 - manager
04:37 - yes um
04:39 - so i work in the responsible ai space so
04:42 - my
04:43 - job is all about
04:45 - when these technologies happen sometimes
04:46 - we have accidents right sometimes we
04:48 - accidentally harm someone or sometimes
04:50 - we actually do something bad that we
04:51 - didn't necessarily intend to do but it
04:53 - happens and so the question is what do
04:56 - we do we typically want to apologize and
04:58 - fix the behavior and make it better
05:00 - right and so in response to ai sometimes
05:03 - there are different harms
05:05 - or biases that we call which means that
05:09 - that the technology doesn't work for
05:10 - everyone so for example if
05:13 - you ever have taken a photo on a cell
05:15 - phone be a pixel be an iphone we do have
05:17 - iphones here
05:19 - um
05:20 - and you've ever had seen a little box
05:22 - that focuses on someone's face it's
05:24 - called autofocus right and historically
05:26 - that has not worked for darker skinned
05:28 - people because there was a bias in the
05:30 - data set where they didn't have enough
05:31 - data of darker skin people to make sure
05:33 - that the technology worked on them also
05:35 - if you've ever put your hands on their
05:36 - hand sanitizer dispenser and the hand
05:39 - sanitizer came out on your hand that's
05:41 - another example of artificial
05:42 - intelligence and again darker skin tones
05:45 - have seen a lot more trouble with it so
05:48 - someone might put their hand under it
05:50 - and it doesn't work because the ai does
05:52 - not recognize the skin tone
05:55 - um and there's also youtube with like
05:56 - recommendations right so if you've ever
05:58 - watched a youtube video and you've seen
05:59 - that little thing where it's like
06:00 - autoplay and the another video comes up
06:02 - like 10 seconds later or you go on a
06:04 - home screen and you see all these
06:06 - recommended videos for you that's also
06:08 - artificial intelligence and so all of
06:10 - these things
06:11 - are made to help people but sometimes
06:13 - they don't and so my job is to make sure
06:17 - that the products being created
06:19 - are um
06:21 - are are being tested to you to be used
06:24 - for
06:25 - um people and for all people and that
06:28 - they're they're you being
06:29 - and that they work equally for all
06:31 - people and so i think that was one of
06:33 - the biggest things that really attracted
06:34 - me to working at google was the fact
06:36 - that there was this team that existed
06:38 - there was a space that existed where i
06:39 - was able to help
06:41 - a lot of people who sometimes are often
06:45 - um
06:46 - forgotten about or unintentionally left
06:48 - out of different kinds of tests or
06:51 - um collections etc
06:54 - and um i love being a program manager
06:56 - because it allows me to do a diverse
06:59 - set of things right i talked about how
07:01 - i'm able to schedule meetings and take
07:02 - notes and that might not seem as
07:03 - exciting but it's really important
07:05 - because when someone needs to find out
07:07 - what happened in a meeting they'd have
07:08 - to look at my notes i've also worked on
07:10 - creating classes i'm also currently
07:12 - running an office hours
07:15 - program which
07:17 - helps people is similar to like a a
07:18 - tutoring program where people can come
07:20 - for help and so i get to do all these
07:22 - really diverse kind of tasks that don't
07:23 - always fit into one bucket and that
07:26 - diversity and that consistent challenge
07:28 - of being able to just do something new
07:30 - within my um
07:32 - job role is really awesome for me
07:35 - thank you for that i've had that
07:37 - experience of doing this because the
07:40 - soap dispenser doesn't recognize exactly
07:42 - my
07:49 - exactly
07:51 - perfect well um
07:54 - i know there's a lot of uh kiddos here
07:56 - from classrooms all across the country
07:58 - who are very interested in either
08:00 - working at google or working in a.i
08:03 - um and before i ask the next question i
08:06 - just want to remind everyone if you do
08:07 - have questions yourself that you'll love
08:09 - taylor to ask about her her work in
08:11 - general please feel free to put it in
08:13 - the chat box we should have some time at
08:15 - the end to get to at least one or two of
08:16 - those questions so if there's a kiddo
08:18 - watching right now um who's like this
08:21 - sounds cool or i would love to you know
08:23 - learn more about
08:25 - or maybe i might myself want to work at
08:26 - google when i get older
08:28 - um what are some of the skills or
08:30 - abilities that they can start working on
08:32 - now
08:34 - yeah so
08:36 - there's a lot and i think the cool thing
08:38 - about being a program manager was some
08:40 - of the skill sets i already experienced
08:42 - from just being in class right so for
08:44 - example i often have to meet deadlines
08:48 - now they're not explicitly called
08:49 - deadlines at work it's more like oh this
08:52 - needs to be done by quarter two but
08:54 - essentially that's a deadline and that's
08:56 - very very similar to like your teacher
08:58 - giving you homework right and you have
09:00 - this assignment that you know you need
09:02 - to do
09:02 - even if it's the next day the next week
09:05 - the next month um
09:07 - and so meeting that homework deadline is
09:09 - the exact same thing that i have to do
09:10 - with meeting my project deadlines um
09:13 - and where your teacher will come in and
09:14 - say hey did you do the homework how did
09:16 - you do and evaluate your performance
09:19 - my boss is the same thing where it's
09:20 - like hey did you finish the project what
09:22 - does the metrics look like was it
09:24 - successful
09:26 - and to be clear it's okay if it wasn't
09:28 - successful in projects
09:30 - um because you always learn right and
09:32 - another thing is like sitting in
09:34 - meetings i have to sit in meetings all
09:35 - the time take notes
09:38 - and be active so similar to how you have
09:40 - to sit in your classroom and sometimes
09:42 - the teacher may ask a question right or
09:44 - you may be having a discussion it's the
09:46 - same exact thing where i am sitting down
09:48 - thinking listening to what's being told
09:50 - and then answering questions or giving
09:53 - my own opinion
09:54 - and then also going into giving opinions
09:56 - it's very much about communication
09:58 - that's a huge part of my job is being
10:00 - able to talk to different people
10:03 - resolve conflict so if you've ever had a
10:06 - disagreement with someone or someone
10:07 - said something that you really didn't
10:08 - like and you were like oh that makes me
10:10 - so angry i've been there and done that
10:13 - you have to learn how to
10:15 - accept the fact that people have
10:16 - different opinions right and those
10:18 - different opinions are not necessarily
10:20 - bad they're just different from yours
10:21 - and so learning how to really hear what
10:24 - people are saying
10:25 - and not just react to the fact that i
10:27 - don't like it and really take in what
10:29 - they're trying to say and figure out how
10:31 - i can
10:32 - join my opinion and their opinions
10:34 - together to create a really great
10:36 - solution for users and so
10:38 - these are just some of the things that
10:40 - um i have to do i do literally every
10:43 - single day
10:44 - that you probably do and you don't even
10:45 - realize it so you could really think to
10:47 - yourself wow i'm i'm acting like a
10:49 - program manager right now and i would
10:51 - wholeheartedly agree with that
10:52 - [Laughter]
10:54 - yeah and i know that it um when you tell
10:57 - people you work at google um i know that
11:01 - it sounds really exciting and it seems
11:02 - really fun to do but are there any
11:05 - hard parts of working at google
11:07 - any obstacles that you face in your role
11:10 - and if so how do you how do you approach
11:11 - them how do you think about them so they
11:13 - turn out positively
11:16 - definitely so
11:18 - google is a very big company like a
11:20 - hundred thousand plus people
11:23 - i don't know if you can imagine that i
11:24 - can't imagine that so
11:27 - um but just know that there's a lot of
11:29 - people with a lot of teams and so
11:31 - it can be difficult to get a good
11:34 - understanding of what's going on because
11:36 - you have to talk to so many different
11:38 - people and then again with this whole
11:40 - conflict resolution thing
11:41 - wow sometimes you really do want to be
11:43 - able to come to this compromise
11:45 - it can be very difficult and so learning
11:47 - how to deal with people who don't
11:49 - necessarily want to work with you or who
11:51 - don't always agree with you or who have
11:53 - other priorities too right because what
11:55 - i find important may not be what someone
11:57 - else finds important and so figuring out
11:59 - how to how we call a game buy-in or get
12:03 - people's in gets get people to be
12:05 - interested in a project that can also be
12:07 - an extremely difficult task and so
12:10 - um those are just a few of the things
12:13 - also i started during the pandemic and
12:15 - so i actually have never met any of my
12:17 - co-workers in person and so i think at
12:20 - the beginning when i first started
12:21 - working that was definitely a conflict i
12:23 - had to learn how to get over was the
12:25 - fact that i had to get to know all these
12:28 - amazing people but i couldn't actually
12:30 - meet them
12:31 - my manager lives in california i'm in
12:33 - chicago i have co-workers in new york i
12:35 - have co-workers in ireland and london so
12:38 - it's really difficult to get us all
12:40 - together and so yeah just having a lot
12:42 - of people having to deal with conflict
12:44 - resolution that's a huge one too and
12:46 - then also having what we call a
12:48 - distributed team which means that
12:49 - everyone lives in a bunch of different
12:51 - places and not really in one in one city
12:54 - together
12:56 - yeah i can definitely understand that
12:58 - i'm in austin texas my manager is on the
13:02 - west coast and in seattle a lot of my
13:04 - poor
13:07 - definitely um can understand that
13:10 - so my second silly question getting to
13:12 - the tough ones um okay
13:16 - which cartoon character do you wish was
13:18 - real
13:21 - oh
13:25 - let's see
13:27 - i feel like i have to go with my
13:29 - favorite cartoon character which is um
13:31 - stitch
13:32 - and i pull out my little like airpods
13:34 - case because it's a little
13:36 - stitch um stitch is like my favorite
13:39 - cartoon character
13:40 - i feel like he's really misunderstood
13:42 - and sometimes he causes trouble but he
13:44 - has a really good heart and he really is
13:46 - trying to make good decisions and be
13:48 - nice to people
13:49 - and the last time i watched lilo and
13:51 - stitch i cried because it touched my
13:52 - heartstrings so much so
13:54 - i think i would love to meet stitch
13:57 - yeah he's so cute i agree i like that
14:00 - one i love that one yeah
14:03 - um okay so we're gonna take our first
14:05 - audience question
14:06 - okay so the question is what is your
14:08 - favorite project that you're currently
14:10 - working on
14:12 - my favorite project i'm currently
14:15 - working on i have to like go through my
14:17 - catalog of projects
14:20 - um
14:21 - so i can't go into too much detail
14:23 - but the one of my main programs is that
14:26 - um
14:28 - is like this office hours program and i
14:30 - love it because
14:31 - um it's literally all about helping
14:33 - people and that was another thing that
14:34 - really drew me to my team google was the
14:38 - fact that this team that i've been
14:39 - working on was really
14:41 - um oriented or
14:43 - focused on helping people and so um
14:46 - and then office hours i just got to
14:48 - learn about all these different teams
14:49 - going to meet all these different people
14:50 - going to learn all about all the really
14:51 - cool things that people are working on
14:53 - in the company and then i also just get
14:55 - to help them
14:57 - and so that's that's always great is to
14:59 - like be in a meeting and have people
15:02 - giving advice and have someone say like
15:04 - this is really helpful this really
15:05 - answered my question i'm so glad i came
15:08 - like that makes my world
15:09 - [Laughter]
15:11 - yeah that sounds fun i like that thank
15:13 - you for sharing that
15:15 - um so when you were little what did you
15:17 - want to be when you grew up and why
15:20 - so um
15:23 - let's do this in phases so when i was
15:24 - like
15:25 - let's say four to maybe seven or eight i
15:29 - really wanted to be a star and a star
15:31 - encompassed being an actress a singer
15:34 - slash pop star and a princess um and
15:37 - halfway had a hold on my life with
15:39 - princess diaries
15:41 - and then once i grew out of that and the
15:43 - color pink
15:44 - um i wanted to be a lawyer
15:47 - um or and slash or a teacher
15:50 - i've really always had a bunch of just
15:52 - really diverse interests i want to be a
15:54 - lawyer because i like sharing my opinion
15:56 - and i also like arguing in like a very
15:58 - healthy constructive way
16:00 - um and i always found like debates and
16:03 - kind of arguing different points and
16:05 - bringing up
16:06 - kind of like deconstructing someone's
16:08 - argument all these different things i
16:10 - found them really entertaining um and in
16:12 - fact one of my teachers actually gave me
16:13 - like a book of the constitution because
16:15 - she was like
16:16 - i think you're going to go into law and
16:18 - then i want to be a teacher because
16:19 - again going back to that whole thing of
16:21 - my love for helping people it's like i
16:23 - really enjoyed that i was able to be a
16:24 - tutor when i was in high school
16:27 - and i just loved um
16:29 - helping people understand a concept that
16:31 - really seemed insurmountable really
16:33 - difficult to understand and kind of
16:36 - breaking it down and using being
16:38 - creative and how i broke it down right
16:39 - to someone like sports to someone like
16:41 - video games like how can i bring in
16:42 - their interests to help them understand
16:44 - this concept and once they did it was
16:46 - always just again the most satisfying
16:48 - feeling to know that someone who felt
16:50 - really bad felt that they couldn't
16:52 - understand something is now able to
16:54 - understand something um and i've also
16:56 - just had some really great teachers in
16:57 - my life
16:59 - um who have really like changed my life
17:00 - and so the fact that they changed my
17:02 - life i think being a teacher is like
17:04 - this amazing job where you're really
17:05 - able to touch a bunch of different lives
17:07 - and help people and really pour into
17:09 - people um and i just love that so
17:12 - even as a little kid i was like i want
17:13 - to be a teacher and so um those are the
17:16 - those are the reasons why
17:18 - so from star to princess
17:23 - to lawyer to teacher to google
17:27 - how how did that um
17:29 - how did you end up at google from that
17:31 - journey like why did you end up deciding
17:33 - to work
17:34 - um specifically at google specifically
17:36 - as a project uh program manager from all
17:38 - the other great things that you could
17:40 - have done
17:41 - yeah so
17:43 - it started when i was little i also have
17:45 - an older brother and i think he also
17:46 - played a part in that because everything
17:48 - that he was interested i was also kind
17:50 - of interested in so he liked a lot of
17:51 - video game systems like the gamecube the
17:54 - nintendo wii
17:56 - we also had dvd players
17:59 - and so um always learning how to like
18:01 - switch the systems and plug in the dvd
18:04 - player and then go back to the to the
18:05 - gamecube and learning how to just really
18:07 - be around technology with something i
18:09 - did at a very young age and then as i
18:11 - got older i became tech support for my
18:14 - family so
18:15 - any questions related to technology of
18:17 - how do i plug this and how do i undo
18:19 - this how do i they always were coming to
18:21 - me or my brother
18:23 - and even to this day i'm still tech
18:24 - support for my family especially since i
18:26 - work at google
18:28 - and then in high school i took a web
18:29 - design course and i loved it i loved
18:32 - being able to design things choose the
18:34 - colors
18:36 - construct the page and the fact that i
18:37 - was able to see it happening in real
18:39 - time so i could make a difference save
18:41 - it and then i could see it literally on
18:43 - the web page it was kind of like this
18:45 - process of being able to instant
18:46 - gratification where i was able to do
18:48 - something solve a problem see the result
18:50 - solve a problem see the result and that
18:52 - was really satisfying to me and so i
18:53 - thought to myself
18:54 - hmm i like this i should do this for
18:57 - like a major and so i was considering
18:59 - computer science and business
19:02 - but then someone was like you should
19:03 - look into information systems and at my
19:05 - school i went to howard university in dc
19:07 - um information system sits in the school
19:10 - business and so
19:12 - i was like well it has business with a
19:15 - little bit of tech and that's exactly
19:16 - what i wanted and so i went there um and
19:19 - then how i got to google is another long
19:21 - story but essentially i um did a program
19:24 - with google called google tech exchange
19:26 - i was there for
19:27 - my entire junior year so about nine
19:29 - months and then i did an internship at
19:31 - google and an internship is essentially
19:33 - where you work at a company but it's a
19:35 - temporary employment so you're not fully
19:37 - there you're not permanently there and
19:39 - it's usually for a set amount of time
19:41 - so i did a bunch of summer internships
19:43 - when i was in college and they were all
19:45 - around three months and so i interned
19:47 - with google on the same team ml fairness
19:50 - now known as responsibly i and um then i
19:53 - got converted to full time meaning that
19:55 - google asked me to come back to them to
19:57 - work for them full time and i accepted
19:59 - that and um so that's kind of my journey
20:03 - and i don't actually know if i will be a
20:05 - lawyer or teacher like none of my dreams
20:06 - are really off maybe the actress and
20:08 - pops are off the table
20:10 - i don't think that's going to happen but
20:12 - i definitely see i definitely see the
20:14 - possibility of being
20:16 - a lawyer or teacher later on in my
20:17 - future and that's kind of something i'm
20:19 - also learning how to do is like how do i
20:21 - make all my dreams possible i may not be
20:23 - able to do them all at once right that
20:25 - doesn't mean i have to give up my dreams
20:26 - i just have to figure out how
20:28 - i can go from one thing to the other or
20:30 - figure out a way to teach while i'm at
20:32 - google or figure out a way to work with
20:34 - legal um
20:36 - cases while i'm at google you know just
20:37 - figure out how to
20:39 - incorporate all my different dreams so
20:41 - that i don't feel like i'm giving up on
20:43 - anything like i'm still able to do what
20:44 - i wanted to do
20:47 - yeah i love that of you know where we
20:49 - have so many different interests as
20:51 - people um and the idea that you don't
20:54 - have to give give it up give one thing
20:56 - up um as we get older i love that
20:59 - um so this next this is the audience
21:01 - question and i'm wondering if my son
21:03 - wrote this one in or not because the
21:05 - obvious question is do you do you help
21:07 - make video games
21:08 - do i help make video games
21:11 - no i'm sorry i'm sorry
21:14 - i don't i play them i play animal
21:16 - crossing i play
21:18 - um gosh i don't remember the other one
21:20 - but i do i do play them um but no i
21:22 - don't i don't think i'm like looking
21:24 - back to think
21:26 - if i've created any video games or i've
21:28 - worked with any teams making video games
21:30 - and the answer is no
21:33 - okay
21:35 - but i'm i
21:36 - i'm pretty sure there's a program
21:37 - manager out there that works
21:40 - along there so all to say even if i
21:42 - don't do it someone else in my role
21:46 - probably that's it
21:47 - okay
21:48 - give a lot of a lot of people high hopes
21:49 - for that
21:50 - [Laughter]
21:53 - um so
21:54 - were there people that helped you in
21:56 - your life that helped you along the way
21:58 - to google in what way and if so in what
22:00 - ways did they help you
22:02 - yeah so i knew this question was coming
22:04 - so i wrote on a list so to make sure
22:07 - to make sure i distracted my thoughts so
22:09 - first of all i i'm i'm christian so i
22:12 - thank god first right like that was
22:14 - probably
22:15 - kept me blessed me all that
22:18 - thank him the second was my family right
22:20 - they really taught me to challenge
22:22 - myself to put myself my best foot
22:24 - forward they were also there to kind of
22:26 - keep me there when i wasn't so if i
22:28 - wasn't doing my homework nudging me like
22:30 - hey
22:30 - do your homework like this is important
22:32 - you're learning things um but also just
22:35 - supporting me my family has been always
22:36 - been super supportive of like everything
22:38 - that i've done and it has really allowed
22:40 - me to kind of
22:41 - do what i want to do in terms of
22:44 - interests and majors i was never really
22:46 - pressured to go to specific school or
22:47 - choose a specific major
22:49 - um
22:50 - next we're gonna get into like my
22:51 - teacher so
22:53 - first one was mrs graham
22:55 - i don't know if she if she saw this she
22:57 - would remember me but she was my teacher
22:59 - from sixth to eighth grade and she
23:01 - taught me english and advanced
23:02 - literature and from her class i really
23:04 - learned how to like think critically but
23:06 - also ask questions and especially in my
23:09 - job especially in this world like it's
23:10 - really important to ask questions and to
23:12 - not be afraid to ask questions and so i
23:15 - really learned how to ask questions and
23:16 - really
23:17 - um
23:18 - question things and question literature
23:21 - and writing and why do we do this how do
23:23 - we do this this way why is it important
23:25 - things of that nature then i have mrs g
23:28 - who is my social studies and science
23:30 - teacher and she's actually the person
23:31 - that gave me the law
23:33 - the constitution and she was just really
23:35 - supportive and i think she saw the
23:37 - potential in me and i remember when i
23:38 - left that middle school um she was just
23:41 - like i know you're going to go very far
23:42 - and like that's always a really warm
23:44 - thing to hear from a teacher and then i
23:46 - had my dean i went to high school i went
23:48 - to a boarding school and a boarding
23:49 - school is essentially where it's like
23:51 - college but for high school so i was
23:53 - living away from my home when i was in
23:55 - high school and i had my dean of the
23:57 - dormitory i was saying and her name is
23:59 - dean jones and she really taught me kind
24:00 - of to have confidence in myself and my
24:03 - abilities and and my and just my being
24:05 - and so when i'm saying something be
24:07 - confident that i know what i'm talking
24:09 - about or
24:10 - when someone does me wrong like don't be
24:12 - afraid to say hey i don't i didn't
24:14 - appreciate that or that really hurt my
24:16 - feelings and being ok and knowing that
24:17 - my feelings are valid in that situation
24:20 - then we have miss nash and i went to
24:21 - high when i went to college and she was
24:23 - just there to really tell me to take
24:25 - ownership of my life right take
24:27 - ownership of my decisions um
24:30 - take risks
24:31 - i think sometimes we're afraid of risks
24:33 - or doing things that we don't know if
24:35 - they're going to be good or not we don't
24:36 - know the the the outcome
24:38 - and risks are perfectly fine because
24:40 - you're going to learn even if if you
24:42 - don't succeed like there's going to be a
24:43 - lesson in anything that you do and so
24:45 - she was really there to support me when
24:46 - i was trying to do something risky and
24:48 - everyone was like don't do it she was
24:50 - like do it she's like if it doesn't work
24:51 - out it's okay like
24:53 - it's not the end of the world um then we
24:55 - have like dr b and dr three c they were
24:57 - also college professors and they were
24:59 - just really supportive too
25:00 - always encouraging me
25:02 - um always trying to help coach me around
25:05 - how to think and like where to
25:06 - especially when i was came to like
25:08 - full-time offers and getting a job
25:09 - outside of college that was
25:11 - that was a really important decision to
25:13 - make and they were definitely some of my
25:15 - counselors that i used and then now as a
25:19 - employee at google i have an amazing
25:21 - manager and amazing mentors who honestly
25:23 - are like safe spaces for me to really
25:25 - just talking about my feelings i can ask
25:28 - questions
25:29 - if i'm blocked on something i can ask
25:30 - for their advice and so all to say i
25:33 - have and there's so many more people
25:34 - that i didn't mention
25:36 - there have been so many people teachers
25:38 - faculty staff
25:40 - um even people who didn't work at the
25:41 - same company or didn't really know like
25:43 - there have been so many people who have
25:44 - definitely influenced my life and have
25:46 - definitely supported me um to help me
25:48 - become the person that i am today and
25:50 - the person that i'm becoming in the
25:52 - future so
25:53 - long-winded answer but all to say yes
25:56 - no that's that's true i i have a i love
26:00 - writing and i remember i had my it was
26:02 - my third grade teacher who was the first
26:05 - person that was like this poem that you
26:06 - wrote was really good and as an adult i
26:08 - still remember that all this time later
26:10 - yes it sticks with you
26:12 - yeah yeah thank you um
26:15 - so you said a little bit earlier that
26:17 - you are still the um the tech support
26:20 - for your family
26:22 - at what age were you when you started
26:24 - working on computers and um programming
26:27 - if you if you've done any sort of
26:28 - programming
26:30 - yeah i don't think i really ever
26:33 - i i even after graduating high school i
26:34 - don't really think i really understood
26:36 - programming but definitely computers
26:38 - i think i got my first desktop when i
26:41 - was really young i remember having an
26:43 - email address at like six
26:45 - and it was like an aol one and then my
26:47 - mom and i had to go through my mom and
26:48 - then you heard the dial up and then i
26:50 - was like wait and i was like what does
26:51 - this sound and yeah so i had my first
26:53 - email um when i was around five or six
26:56 - and i emailed my cousin so that was like
26:57 - the first that was like my first
26:59 - introductory to email and then my
27:01 - brother and i both got computers so
27:04 - probably around six or seven five six or
27:05 - seven like that was kind of the time
27:07 - where i started having a desktop and
27:09 - then once i started really getting into
27:10 - like
27:11 - how computers work and problem solving
27:13 - was probably around like
27:15 - eight nine ten um but since i had it i
27:18 - was always just kind of curious and
27:19 - clicking things and like oh look at this
27:21 - paint app i can draw things or look at
27:24 - solitaire how do i play this um or the
27:26 - pinball game
27:28 - all of those were yeah i was so from a
27:31 - very young from a pretty young age i was
27:34 - i was definitely using technology i at
27:36 - least had an email address
27:38 - well at six who were you emailing me
27:41 - yeah my cousin um i remember there was
27:44 - like the whole situation with my family
27:46 - and i just want to tell my cousin that i
27:47 - supported her and i didn't agree with
27:48 - that
27:49 - what any of the dolls were saying that i
27:51 - still loved her and i thought she was so
27:53 - wonderful
27:54 - and i'm not mistaken that was my very
27:56 - first email and then my grandmother to
27:58 - this day still sends me a lot of email
28:00 - so
28:01 - if no one else was emailing me my
28:02 - grandmother was
28:03 - [Laughter]
28:05 - yes yes gotta love grandmas
28:07 - [Laughter]
28:09 - so for our last question this is the
28:11 - last silly question that we have and
28:12 - actually came from
28:13 - one of our audience members who are
28:15 - watching if you had a super power what
28:17 - would it be
28:19 - this was an icebreaker question for
28:22 - a for a presentation that i had to give
28:24 - so this is really exciting
28:26 - that's a great question
28:27 - um
28:29 - so my answer and when i when we asked
28:31 - this was like repelling mosquitoes um
28:33 - which doesn't seem like a really
28:35 - important one but i get a lot of
28:36 - mosquito bites
28:37 - um but if i had to choose
28:40 - let's see one i think i said um
28:43 - maybe something around like traveling i
28:45 - want to say i want to marry like
28:46 - speaking every language and then also
28:47 - being able to teleport um so i love
28:50 - languages i love learning languages um i
28:52 - took like korean and french and spanish
28:55 - all throughout like my
28:56 - at different points in my life and so um
28:58 - i would love to just be able to like
29:00 - know all the languages and speak them
29:03 - that would be so cool and then yeah
29:05 - being able to teleport anywhere so i can
29:06 - actually use this skill would be amazing
29:09 - so
29:10 - dealing with like language language
29:11 - teleportation i don't know if that's
29:13 - something
29:15 - or being able to teleport teleport to a
29:17 - country and automatically understand the
29:19 - language i think
29:20 - that may be a smoother ride
29:23 - that's why i love the google translate
29:25 - function just for that same reason
29:28 - well thank you so much taylor for
