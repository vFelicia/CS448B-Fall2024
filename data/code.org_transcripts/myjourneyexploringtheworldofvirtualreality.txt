00:05 - hello hello and welcome to today's my
00:09 - journey class chat my name is cat leia
00:12 - ramos and i'm going to be your host for
00:14 - today's chat a little bit about myself
00:16 - i'm actually a software engineer
00:19 - at code.org which means i get to
00:22 - basically code all day
00:25 - so first of all thank you to all the
00:26 - teachers and the students out there for
00:28 - joining us today teachers just so you
00:31 - know we have enabled
00:33 - live captioning for all of our class
00:34 - chats today and going forward so you'll
00:37 - see that on the screen
00:39 - and today we get to talk with tanya
00:43 - parker we're very excited tanya parker
00:46 - helps build virtual reality experiences
00:49 - at mediquest
00:51 - so we're very excited to talk to her
00:53 - today
00:54 - teachers as we're talking and going
00:56 - through questions if you have any
00:58 - questions that come up please put them
01:00 - in the chat that way we can see them and
01:02 - if we have time at the end we'll try to
01:04 - get to as many questions that we can
01:07 - alright so i'm going to kick us off with
01:09 - a fun icebreaker
01:11 - this is something i've been doing a lot
01:13 - while being at home and during the
01:15 - pandemic just not really going and
01:17 - seeing people in person but i've been
01:19 - doing a lot of show and tells so the way
01:22 - this works is i will pick something from
01:25 - around my desk i will show it to you and
01:27 - i will tell you about it
01:30 - so today my show and tell
01:32 - are these slippers that i have they look
01:35 - like dumplings they're very soft very
01:38 - warm and
01:39 - they're kind of cool because if you can
01:41 - see they plug in to power and they
01:43 - actually are heated so when it's really
01:46 - cold i can keep my feet nice and warm
01:49 - all right so now i'm gonna go ahead and
01:51 - pass it off to you tanya give us a
01:53 - little show and tell and then um
01:55 - introduce yourself i'll grab something
01:57 - too
01:58 - uh who doesn't like a heated val cozy oh
02:01 - yeah
02:02 - i love my share of cozy things as well
02:04 - these are some stuffed animals from my
02:06 - neighbor totoro which is a studio ghibli
02:08 - film um i love a lot of studio ghibli
02:11 - films especially the ones directed by
02:12 - miyazaki so couldn't resist these little
02:15 - guys
02:16 - very very cute
02:18 - um so yeah tanya could you just give us
02:20 - a quick intro about yourself
02:22 - sure
02:23 - i'll share my screen and show you some
02:25 - of the things i work on so hi my name is
02:28 - tanya i'm a senior technical program
02:30 - manager at oculus now known as metaquest
02:33 - and i work on for a company that creates
02:36 - virtual reality experiences
02:38 - so if you've seen this this is the quest
02:40 - 2 it's a really popular device in a way
02:43 - for you to connect to these virtual
02:45 - reality experiences as a technical
02:48 - program manager i get to do a little bit
02:50 - of everything so if you've heard of
02:52 - software engineering product design
02:54 - product management i work with all kinds
02:57 - of roles and disciplines to problem
03:00 - solve and create these 3d immersive
03:05 - experiences
03:06 - so virtual reality is like playing a
03:10 - video game but instead of 2d it's 3d and
03:14 - you're completely surrounded
03:16 - by a new environment so you can feel
03:18 - like you're in a totally different place
03:20 - when you're just in your living room uh
03:22 - so here is an example of what this
03:24 - quest two looks like and something i get
03:26 - to work with and play on almost every
03:28 - day as part of my job
03:31 - very cool yes i think i have played a
03:33 - one virtual reality game called beat
03:35 - saber maybe you're familiar with it but
03:38 - it's cool because there's music but it's
03:40 - scary because you're in the video game
03:42 - and then as music is playing there's
03:44 - blocks going by and you kind of have
03:46 - this virtual sword that you're using to
03:48 - cut through the blocks but yeah it's
03:50 - very cool to be in the game
03:53 - um awesome
03:55 - so you kind of describe that you're a
03:57 - technical project manager and that you
03:59 - work on virtual reality i'm kind of
04:01 - curious can you tell us
04:03 - um
04:04 - maybe a little bit more about virtual
04:06 - reality and maybe even some projects
04:08 - that you've been working on
04:09 - sure
04:10 - so uh virtual reality can really be you
04:15 - know it's up to your imagination of all
04:17 - the things that virtual reality can do
04:19 - and that's one of the really cool things
04:20 - about my job is we're trying to figure
04:22 - out how to build metaverse in a way that
04:25 - helps connect people in our communities
04:28 - so here's an example of a home
04:31 - environment you know you could build
04:32 - your dream home for example with awesome
04:35 - high ceilings huge tv screen fancy food
04:40 - it can really be anything you could go
04:42 - travel the world you can play games like
04:44 - beat saber you can um stay fit you know
04:48 - like maybe something your parents would
04:49 - like to do
04:50 - and some of the projects that i work on
04:53 - uh one example is i have enabled
04:55 - notifications so on your phone when you
04:58 - get a text message or some kind of
05:00 - notification we can now show that on
05:03 - your headset so you don't have to remove
05:06 - your headset to look at your phone and
05:07 - read that notification so it's a way for
05:10 - you to stay in the virtual reality space
05:12 - and get to stay plugged in without
05:14 - having to disrupt or interrupt the
05:17 - experience and really enjoy yourself in
05:19 - virtual reality
05:21 - wow that's very cool that makes me
05:23 - realize you could basically just be
05:25 - living in the virtual reality all the
05:27 - time because you can get all of your
05:29 - notifications
05:30 - very very cool um can you tell us a
05:32 - little bit more about what your
05:34 - day-to-day looks like a typical day in
05:36 - your life at work yeah so i have a very
05:40 - collaborative job which means
05:43 - i don't work on things by myself i have
05:45 - to work with a ton of people all the
05:47 - time which for adults that's usually a
05:49 - lot of meetings so we usually have a
05:52 - bunch of problems to solve every day
05:54 - where we need to decide what something
05:56 - looks like feels like how people
05:59 - experience it so that they really have
06:02 - fun and are engaged and enjoy the
06:04 - experience and so we just try to build
06:06 - that in the best way possible so we ask
06:09 - each other a lot of questions we want to
06:11 - make sure we build it the right way so
06:13 - we are
06:14 - protecting people's privacy and just
06:17 - making it overall a very like enjoyable
06:20 - way for people to relax entertain
06:22 - themselves and connect so i am usually
06:26 - just walking through a lot of those
06:28 - problems until we're able to get to you
06:31 - know these milestones are just uh
06:34 - checkpoints into creating and launching
06:36 - our project or feature
06:39 - um so as another example
06:42 - one cool thing about the oculus quest is
06:44 - that you have these controllers that you
06:47 - know allow you to point and choose and
06:50 - show where your hands are and so an
06:52 - example of a problem that we needed to
06:53 - solve is we want to get rid of these
06:55 - controllers so that you can just use
06:56 - your hands and point and click and touch
07:00 - and grab and really interact with the
07:02 - environment so it feels like you're
07:04 - grabbing things and and and
07:07 - it feels real um and so that's a problem
07:10 - that you know nobody's saw before and
07:12 - somebody had to solve it and so that's
07:14 - what's really exciting is that uh you
07:16 - get to be creative in solving these
07:18 - problems and figuring it out together
07:22 - yeah that sounds really cool just
07:24 - because thinking about oftentimes
07:26 - thinking about technology and software
07:27 - but also virtual reality and 3d spaces
07:31 - these are all things that are brand new
07:33 - and so i'm sure problems are coming up
07:35 - all the time related to things that
07:37 - don't even exist yet and it's kind of
07:38 - like wow how do you solve a problem that
07:41 - no one's even tried to solve before i
07:44 - was kind of curious because you
07:45 - mentioned collaborating with a lot of
07:47 - people and working together
07:49 - in a group to kind of solve a problem
07:51 - i i'm just wondering do you have any
07:54 - takeaways or tips that you've learned
07:56 - from working with others that you feel
07:58 - like wow this is really helpful when
07:59 - you're working in a group and you're
08:01 - trying to solve a really hard problem
08:03 - i think the most important thing to
08:05 - realize is that everybody thinks about
08:07 - it a little differently and so the whole
08:09 - point of working on it together is
08:12 - listening to everybody's perspective and
08:15 - hearing what ideas they have what
08:17 - options they're suggesting and really
08:19 - making it a melting pot of like of those
08:22 - ideas um so it's
08:25 - being flexible to hearing a different
08:27 - thinking or point of view um hearing you
08:30 - know
08:31 - other ways to to approach the problem
08:34 - other ideas so
08:36 - just being open and listening to each
08:38 - other and just kind of going through
08:40 - each of the ideas and suggestions so
08:41 - that you can weigh the pros and cons or
08:43 - what we call trade-offs in the industry
08:46 - uh and then that way that can help you
08:48 - make a choice together versus having to
08:50 - always have one person pick for example
08:52 - but
08:53 - sometimes it helps to have a leader or a
08:55 - manager who really can drive the
08:57 - conversation but i think what makes this
09:00 - kind of role so much more rewarding is
09:02 - that we can do this together
09:06 - that's awesome so i'm hearing that
09:08 - sometimes it's actually more helpful
09:10 - when you're
09:11 - pro problem solving or you have
09:13 - something you don't know the answer to
09:14 - to actually include more people because
09:16 - like you mentioned you get more
09:18 - perspectives and you get a lot of people
09:20 - seeing it from different points of view
09:22 - yeah i definitely agree that comes up in
09:24 - my day-to-day a lot too definitely and
09:26 - the more diversity you have with like
09:28 - your co-workers and the people that you
09:29 - hire the more that
09:31 - you can represent the people that you
09:33 - are
09:34 - creating this for because virtual
09:35 - reality is for everyone for anyone and
09:38 - we want to make sure that it works for
09:40 - all kinds of people
09:42 - awesome yeah it's great that that's all
09:45 - top of mind for you including as many
09:47 - people as you can
09:49 - great
09:51 - what do you
09:53 - love about your job what's awesome about
09:54 - your job
09:56 - uh what's awesome it
09:58 - is really exciting to be able to create
10:02 - these experiences that millions of
10:04 - people can
10:06 - use and and enjoy
10:08 - so something that feels like oh i'm just
10:10 - deciding the small piece or building
10:12 - this little little feature
10:14 - it really makes an impact on people's
10:16 - lives and how they get to relax at the
10:19 - end of the day
10:20 - um or how they get to connect with their
10:22 - friends you know something with the
10:24 - pandemic is thankfully
10:26 - video conferences has has become more
10:28 - norm and people are like having um like
10:32 - birthday parties and and sort of things
10:34 - virtually and so we hope that virtual
10:37 - reality can have that same build that
10:39 - same bridge uh so it's really exciting
10:41 - to be able to to build that next step
10:44 - um but i also really like that having a
10:46 - job like this enables me to do a lot of
10:48 - other things in my life like i get to
10:51 - have a really great work-life balance
10:53 - and enjoy
10:54 - um life
10:56 - so i live in seattle and i do a lot of
10:59 - outdoorsy things like hiking with my dog
11:02 - i have a corgi i tried my first
11:04 - triathlon last year
11:07 - um i really like to travel and so i get
11:09 - a lot of
11:10 - good vacation time and enjoy a lot of
11:13 - food while i travel as well
11:16 - so here's some some pictures of me my
11:18 - friends my boyfriend here in jollibee is
11:21 - uh one of these filipino fast food chain
11:24 - restaurants and it's my favorite chick
11:26 - fried chicken um so i just wanted to
11:28 - show a little bit of that like my work
11:29 - is great and it's just it's it's a great
11:31 - way for also for me to enjoy my my my
11:34 - life outside of work
11:36 - oh i love that i'm also
11:38 - filipino-american so jolly b is very
11:40 - near and dear to my heart and if anyone
11:42 - out there
11:44 - could try the fried chicken at jollibee
11:46 - you will be very happy
11:48 - um that's great i also want to give a
11:50 - quick reminder that if
11:52 - teachers students as you're listening if
11:53 - any questions come up definitely feel
11:55 - free to put them in the chat so we can
11:56 - get to them at the end um if you have
11:58 - any questions about anything tanya has
12:00 - mentioned so far definitely please do
12:02 - ask those questions we'd love to hear
12:04 - them
12:05 - um
12:06 - cool so you told us a little bit about
12:08 - what you love about your job about what
12:10 - you love to do outside of work uh kind
12:12 - of curious when you were younger
12:15 - maybe even around the age between like a
12:17 - kindergarten and i think maybe fifth
12:19 - grade is where some of our audiences are
12:21 - at so when you were younger what did you
12:23 - want to be when you grew up and why
12:26 - oh
12:27 - um that's a great question because i had
12:30 - a lot of things in mind um when i was
12:33 - younger my parents really wanted me to
12:34 - be a lawyer
12:36 - and i thought that seemed kind of cool i
12:37 - watched a bunch of movies where people
12:38 - got to argue in court and win cases and
12:41 - i felt like that would be fun
12:43 - um but then i realized that you know
12:45 - court's a really small part of that job
12:47 - and there's a lot more about the job
12:48 - that i probably wouldn't enjoy as much
12:51 - uh i really liked um a criminology class
12:54 - i took in middle school and so i i was
12:57 - fascinated by fingerprint analysis and
13:01 - um
13:02 - how people analyze like evidence at
13:05 - crime scenes and i thought that was
13:07 - really cool too but a little grim
13:11 - um but i was also interested in
13:13 - landscape architecture i love plants
13:16 - flowers and gardens and i thought it'd
13:19 - be interesting to design places that
13:20 - would attract lots of birds and
13:22 - butterflies and just be an escape an
13:25 - oasis
13:26 - but eventually i found computer science
13:28 - and
13:29 - it caught me by surprise i had not even
13:32 - heard of it until high school a friend
13:34 - of mine wanted to
13:36 - take the ap computer science class and i
13:39 - did not know it was and he suggested he
13:41 - thought it might be fun for me i was
13:43 - like why not i'll give it a try and i
13:45 - loved it i just completely loved it um
13:49 - i
13:50 - enjoyed it because it just it was such a
13:52 - great mix of that creative creative side
13:55 - and analytical side where i really loved
13:57 - math and science but i also felt
13:59 - artistic and computer science kind of
14:02 - just lets you
14:03 - use all of those skills when you're
14:05 - creating things
14:07 - so when i applied for college i applied
14:09 - to have schools in business just in case
14:13 - that's sort of what my mom was like well
14:14 - in case you know you you don't like
14:16 - computer science business is a safe
14:18 - option and half the school's computer
14:20 - science and i eventually accepted uh
14:22 - university of southern california
14:24 - computer science computer engineering
14:25 - degree
14:26 - and then i freaked out uh during my
14:29 - welcome week i was hearing all kinds of
14:32 - things
14:33 - suggesting otherwise like people saying
14:36 - that all the jobs would be outsourced
14:38 - you know you're not gonna have a job out
14:39 - of college and
14:41 - eventually i found that that was
14:43 - completely untrue
14:44 - but at the time it scared me and i
14:47 - changed my major to chemical engineering
14:49 - because then i thought i liked chemistry
14:51 - you know kind of related back to that
14:52 - criminology that i was interested in
14:54 - when i was much younger
14:55 - um
14:56 - but i just wasn't enjoying myself it you
14:58 - know you just kind of feel it when you
15:01 - aren't happy and you're just sort of
15:03 - doing the motions and luckily in that in
15:06 - that major i was uh required to take a
15:08 - computer science 101 or an introduction
15:11 - class and it was awesome and i had so
15:14 - much fun it was like the only class i
15:16 - remember wanting to have extra homework
15:18 - just because i thought the problems were
15:19 - fun and i wanted to solve more of them
15:22 - and i realized you know what this is
15:24 - what i like to do i saw in lots of
15:26 - career fairs everybody is looking for
15:28 - computer science majors because it's not
15:30 - just computer engineer software
15:32 - engineers that
15:33 - you know that major can help but
15:35 - there are lots of applications and other
15:37 - roles like mine that a computer science
15:40 - degree is super useful for so i switched
15:42 - back eventually found my way
15:45 - um and i started out as a software
15:46 - engineer at co.org actually and
15:49 - eventually tried product management and
15:51 - technical program management and this is
15:53 - my happy place
15:56 - long story short
15:58 - but that's great because i think it
16:00 - really showcases that
16:02 - like when i was younger i used to think
16:04 - oh you you know what you want to do when
16:06 - you're really young and you know what
16:08 - you're passionate about and then you go
16:09 - to school and you study that and then
16:11 - you do it and i think that your story
16:14 - really showcases that sometimes it's
16:16 - really good to try a lot of things and
16:18 - explore a lot of things because you
16:19 - never know what you're going to be
16:20 - interested in i also loved hearing that
16:23 - you know all of these things you were
16:24 - interested like the problem solving from
16:27 - you know the
16:29 - criminal like criminology and
16:31 - um the creativity with the landscaping
16:34 - that you found a way to explore a bunch
16:36 - of things and then find something that
16:38 - really combined it all which i think is
16:40 - so true with technology nowadays because
16:43 - you never know what's what jobs are
16:45 - going to exist in 10 years from now
16:48 - maybe something you really love will
16:49 - will come up that you've never even
16:51 - heard of
16:52 - um and this question actually ties
16:54 - really well into a question we actually
16:57 - got from the audience if it's okay for
16:58 - me to ask that now
17:00 - um coach mo asks do you think in a
17:02 - hundred years from now
17:04 - most people will have vr headsets and
17:06 - maybe even uh vr headsets for free
17:10 - 100 years from now so
17:13 - technology evolves quite rapidly it
17:15 - changes
17:16 - so fast but i think it's going to be
17:18 - completely different not in the headset
17:20 - that we know of because headsets are
17:23 - pretty clunky they're heavy you can't
17:25 - really use them for very long
17:27 - um and as we've seen with things like
17:30 - cell phones and computers things will
17:32 - get smaller and yet perform better and
17:35 - faster and stronger and so i'm hoping
17:37 - that it's something like a contact lens
17:40 - you know not even glasses
17:42 - or maybe it's something that um is sort
17:45 - of bio or like in your body
17:47 - you put in a a little thing or a stamp
17:50 - and it just sort of appears and you can
17:52 - press a little button on your body and
17:53 - you're there um do i think everybody
17:56 - will be there
17:57 - yes honestly that's why i work here i
17:59 - think that's the future you know it's
18:01 - the next internet it's the next wave
18:04 - that people will become obsessed with
18:06 - like how much time do we spend on our
18:08 - phones on tick-tock you know watching
18:11 - people do things trying to try to
18:13 - connect with people through technology
18:15 - so maybe not through headsets but will
18:17 - people be in the middle verse yes
18:19 - absolutely
18:21 - oh yeah the way you just described that
18:23 - just reminded me of all like superhero
18:26 - movies and every movie i watch with
18:27 - technology they're kind of just like
18:29 - opening things with their hands and it's
18:31 - right there in space they don't have to
18:33 - use a computer um
18:35 - and i totally agree with you never know

19:10 - if you like it or not stay open and try
19:12 - it give it a shot
19:14 - um it's so new you know like
19:16 - even even for me when i was learning
19:18 - about it it wasn't a thing
19:21 - or people didn't know very much about it
19:23 - at that age and i think you're so lucky
19:25 - to be exposed to it now
19:27 - um so give it a shot and see what you
19:29 - like about it and encourage your friends
19:31 - too
19:32 - um don't be afraid to make mistakes and
19:35 - that's the whole point of it is it's not
19:37 - going to be perfect the first time
19:39 - you're going to try one thing it's not
19:42 - going to work and then you're going to
19:43 - make tweaks and tweaks and tweaks and
19:44 - tweaks and it'll be so satisfying when
19:47 - you finally get it to work it's just
19:49 - you're going to spend hours on it
19:51 - thinking about it and coming going away
19:53 - and coming back and there's nothing like
19:55 - that
19:56 - that feeling when you when you finally
19:58 - solve it figure it out like i did that
20:01 - you know nobody showed me how to do it
20:02 - nobody did it for me i figured it out on
20:04 - my own and i made this thing you know
20:07 - maybe the computer said something maybe
20:08 - i made a website maybe i made an app
20:10 - like it's just so much fun to see that
