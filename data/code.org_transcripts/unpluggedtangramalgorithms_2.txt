00:07 - Lesson 6 teaches algorithms and gets across
how important it is to be as clear as possible.
00:12 - This lesson has two parts.
00:14 - The first uses tangrams which are puzzle pieces
taht look like this.
00:18 - If you don't have tangrams, you or your students
can cut them out by hand.
00:23 - Students will have to explain to a fellow
classmate how to arrange tangrams in a specific
00:27 - pattern but the second student isn't able
to see what the original pattern is.
00:32 - In the second half of the activity, we ask
students how many different ways they can
00:37 - fold a piece of paper to create sixteen identical
rectangles.
00:41 - Then you'll discuss how multiple solutions
can lead to the same end result and why some
00:46 - solutions are better in certain situations.
