00:02 - [Music]
00:24 - hi everyone and welcome to code bytes in
00:27 - today's session we'll visit the
00:28 - fictional monster town where a virus
00:31 - outbreak is about to happen we'll be
00:33 - programming and running simulations to
00:35 - understand how the virus spreads and
00:37 - what can be done to slow it down and
00:39 - help all the monsters get healthy again
00:42 - hi my name is leonardo ortiz and i'm
00:44 - vice president of international
00:46 - partnerships at code.org and this is my
00:49 - daughter natalia who's going to be
00:51 - playing as my sidekick and co-programmer
00:54 - today hello i am 14 years old i am in
00:57 - ninth grade and during the pandemic i
01:00 - have been learning coding using the cs
01:02 - fundamentals express that's cool
01:05 - did you like it
01:06 - yeah it's a lot of fun it's perfect so
01:09 - today is very special because as you may
01:11 - know this episode is one of the many
01:14 - activities that we're doing to celebrate
01:17 - computer science education week which is
01:19 - happening this week and there's a lot of
01:22 - students and teachers all over the world
01:24 - doing an hour of code trying an hour of
01:27 - code some some of them for the very
01:29 - first time in their life so i know that
01:32 - many of you are joining us for different
01:33 - cities uh i would like to see where
01:36 - where you're from we have a map
01:39 - in which we'll see
01:41 - where you're joining us from
01:43 - so wow
01:44 - i expected a lot of different cities in
01:47 - the u.s which we do have we have some
01:49 - people in alaska we have some people
01:50 - from mexico
01:52 - i see someone in venezuela but i'm
01:54 - surprised to see
01:56 - that there are also some of you joining
01:58 - us from europe from africa uh even all
02:02 - the way from india that is amazing uh so
02:06 - that's very impressive
02:08 - and uh
02:09 - well we're both in seattle natalie and i
02:11 - are here in seattle today actually i
02:13 - wanted to be here at the headquarters of
02:15 - code.org in downtown seattle uh just to
02:18 - be with you uh for this episode um
02:21 - there's there's a little bit over one
02:24 - billion
02:25 - times that students have done hours of
02:28 - code uh since we started the hour of
02:31 - code seven years ago but before we get
02:34 - into today's activity i actually want to
02:38 - acknowledge and recognize a
02:41 - female pioneer in the computer science
02:45 - space today is her birthday
02:48 - and by the way it is one of the reasons
02:51 - why we are celebrating computer science
02:54 - education week around this date so we're
02:56 - going to put a poll to see if you know
02:58 - who i'm talking about
03:00 - so we have several options here loblis
03:04 - nova roy mutin grace hopper mary ellen
03:07 - wilkies
03:08 - so we see that there's a lot of people
03:11 - voting for
03:13 - one
03:15 - candidate in particular and then
03:18 - okay let's stop it there i think i think
03:21 - around half of the audience actually
03:24 - knew the answer today
03:26 - is the birthday of grace hopper um
03:31 - for those of you that don't know her i'm
03:33 - actually going to read something here is
03:35 - um
03:37 - admiral grace hoppers uh is her birthday
03:40 - today if you don't know her she was born
03:42 - in 1906 and was a highly respected
03:46 - admiral in the u.s navy and she helped
03:48 - developed a compiler that was a
03:50 - precursor to the widely used programming
03:53 - language called cobol
03:56 - we always make sure
03:57 - to plan computer science education week
04:00 - as i mentioned around her birthday so
04:04 - let's move on natalia
04:06 - today we're going to learn how to code
04:09 - using a tool called sprite lab we're
04:11 - actually going to try and do a
04:13 - simulation the simulation of an outbreak
04:16 - why
04:17 - because we're in the middle of a
04:18 - pandemic so i think it's very
04:20 - appropriate for us to try and and better
04:23 - understand how a pandemic behaves in
04:26 - coding allows us to explore a little bit
04:28 - more about how that happens and
04:32 - and mainly because when you simulate
04:35 - something a simulation allows you to
04:37 - better understand something that happens
04:40 - in the world like in this case a
04:42 - candidate so you can follow us by
04:46 - by
04:47 - in your computer if you just go and
04:49 - write code.org
04:51 - outbreak then you can also do the
04:54 - simulation at the same time as we are
04:56 - going to be doing it so natalia do you
04:58 - want to share the screen with you yeah
05:01 - so natalia is going to be driving
05:03 - she's going to be
05:04 - [Music]
05:06 - showing us her screen
05:08 - perfect so if you're doing this in your
05:11 - computers and you typed code.org
05:14 - outbreak this is what you will see
05:16 - uh and natalia why don't you tell us a
05:18 - little bit about what's going on here
05:20 - with monster town i see i see a lot of
05:22 - monsters there
05:23 - yeah
05:24 - mountain town's usually a happy and
05:26 - healthy place and they like to wander
05:28 - around to visit their friends but one
05:30 - day one of the monsters has caught a
05:33 - virus which is a tiny germ that can make
05:35 - monsters sick
05:36 - but the other monsters are not too
05:38 - worried about it they keep visiting
05:39 - their friends but soon more monsters
05:42 - keep catching the virus and so the
05:45 - remaining healthy monsters want to
05:47 - research ways to prevent other monsters
05:49 - from getting sick and so they found that
05:51 - if they wear a mask it is less likely
05:54 - for sick monsters to spread to other
05:56 - healthy monsters perfect well that's a
05:59 - great story and it kind of talks about
06:01 - what happens during a pandemic but
06:04 - if we actually code and we use the
06:07 - learnings of computer science we can
06:09 - actually bring this monster down to life
06:12 - do you want to do that
06:13 - yeah sure let's do it we're going to
06:15 - click continue so that we can get into
06:18 - the levels and this is what we have here
06:21 - in this tool in sprite level you have
06:23 - the workspace which is where we're going
06:24 - to be doing all the coding you have this
06:27 - middle section that says blocks where
06:28 - you have different blocks we're going to
06:30 - be pulling blocks from there to do our
06:32 - simulation and you have the canvas side
06:34 - on the left to the upper left corner
06:37 - where we're going to see what is it that
06:38 - we're creating
06:40 - what do you think about that color
06:41 - natalia do you like it
06:43 - no how about we do okay um something
06:46 - like this okay you like peach
06:49 - perfect so we're gonna have that um we
06:52 - now have that color and the instruction
06:55 - here is that we need to create ten
06:57 - healthy sprites uh in one sprite that is
07:00 - sick so how do you do that
07:02 - well let's look at the tab sprites
07:05 - okay we have we have these blocks that
07:07 - say sprites you need to drag those
07:09 - blocks
07:10 - and add
07:12 - so now we have 10 healthy sprites we're
07:14 - missing the the the sick one
07:19 - perfect so now we have the sprites
07:22 - but sprites are a little bit uh
07:24 - a little bit large don't you think yeah
07:26 - they look too squish
07:28 - well
07:29 - in order if and if you want to change
07:31 - that how do you do it
07:33 - well there's actions see what's in there
07:37 - okay if in those actions you actually
07:40 - can do certain things in our simulation
07:43 - in this case you need to draw drag that
07:45 - block that says size
07:48 - and look it already kind of gave you a
07:50 - size what if you wanted to go like very
07:52 - small and do like 10 10 10
07:56 - oh yeah i don't think i can see that so
07:59 - let's let's keep it at 50
08:01 - so that it can actually uh
08:03 - have a little bit of space there now
08:06 - we already have our sprites you have the
08:08 - right size but they're just static like
08:10 - they're not doing anything
08:12 - so
08:13 - you probably want them to do something
08:15 - where do you where would you go to do
08:17 - that let's see what else is in actions
08:21 - oh look look at this
08:23 - okay if you drag that block
08:26 - that has an action there and you put it
08:28 - at the end it's going to say that all
08:30 - sprites are now going to
08:33 - wander so
08:35 - in order to see what is it that we're
08:36 - coding here you need to click
08:39 - run so let's do it
08:42 - oh look they're moving they're moving
08:45 - and so so now they're moving
08:48 - but
08:49 - we're in the middle of an outbreak
08:53 - and and this is where
08:55 - right now we haven't coded
08:57 - an event which is the word of the day
09:00 - that's so let's let's not share the the
09:03 - screen let's go back here
09:06 - perfect
09:07 - so today we're going to learn about
09:09 - events and for those of you that joined
09:12 - yesterday where we coded with a dance
09:15 - party that activity is all about
09:17 - creating events for you to do things
09:20 - dance moves so today
09:22 - right now we've already created some
09:24 - monsters the monsters have the right
09:26 - size they're there but nothing is going
09:28 - on so we need to create an event
09:31 - in an event is
09:33 - when you actually do something you
09:36 - create an action in computer science
09:39 - when you're coding to
09:41 - drive a reaction that's an event you and
09:45 - and you can create an action by
09:47 - by ordering your computer to do
09:49 - something when you do a click in your
09:51 - mouse or when you type a specific uh
09:55 - letter in your keyboard there are many
09:57 - ways in which you can create events but
09:58 - it's basically
10:00 - creating an action
10:02 - so that then that produces a reaction so
10:06 - that's an event um
10:08 - we're gonna we actually have a poll uh
10:10 - so that we can explore this concept a
10:12 - little bit more so let's say it says
10:14 - which of this
10:15 - is an example of an event
10:18 - going to a birthday party
10:21 - singing in the school concert
10:23 - or tapping an icon to open an app
10:28 - so i see there's almost a tie there
10:30 - between two responses
10:33 - getting close but
10:35 - but a little bit over half of you
10:37 - actually
10:38 - uh guessed right you know the the event
10:41 - in this context is tapping an icon to
10:45 - open an app yes for the rest of you that
10:47 - also said going to a party is an event
10:49 - or singing a school concert definitely
10:51 - in real life in the things that we do
10:53 - those are events but when you're talking
10:55 - about computer science an event is when
10:57 - you make the computer do something
11:00 - because you are already inputting
11:02 - something like clicking or
11:04 - identifying something that will happen
11:08 - so
11:09 - let's uh
11:10 - let's let's do another poll let's now do
11:13 - an event kind of like a uh an unplugged
11:16 - let's do an unplugged activity let's do
11:18 - an event here and for that we're gonna
11:21 - need the help of all of you out there um
11:24 - what if we wanna do something uh like
11:28 - arm
11:29 - an arm wave a silly face jazz hands
11:32 - let's all play with this
11:34 - and i i kind of guess what it's going to
11:36 - win so let's see let's see
11:39 - if i'm gonna be right yeah
11:41 - uh most people
11:43 - decided that they want to do a silly
11:45 - phase so
11:47 - let's just try not to can you do a silly
11:49 - phase
11:51 - okay so
11:53 - that's not in itself an event an event
11:55 - is now gonna be when i prompt you to do
11:59 - a silly phase so i'm gonna invite
12:01 - everyone there
12:03 - watching us to do us their best silly
12:06 - face possible every time i clap okay so
12:09 - when i clap you do a silly phase when i
12:12 - clap again you do another silly phase
12:14 - okay
12:15 - let's start
12:23 - perfect so those were three events that
12:26 - we used by clapping and then uh
12:30 - having a reaction to my club so we're
12:33 - going to
12:34 - continue doing events but now in our
12:36 - simulator for that we're going to no
12:39 - this is this is the one
12:40 - we're going to share the screen once
12:42 - again and we're going to put continue
12:47 - so let's see what's going to happen now
12:51 - so what happens in a pandemic uh natalia
12:54 - where
12:54 - when we
12:55 - [Music]
12:58 - you wanna you wanted to remove something
13:00 - yeah so just put put clear
13:03 - uh start over again so in a pandemic
13:05 - what happens when
13:08 - let's see that in monster town
13:12 - a
13:14 - a healthy monster comes across a sick
13:17 - monster and they touch each other
13:20 - the healthy monster will be sick
13:22 - the healthy monster gets sick so that's
13:25 - going to be an event and that's what
13:26 - we're going to try to do here so in
13:29 - order for us to produce that event in
13:31 - our simulator
13:32 - then we go to this new block that
13:35 - appeared here
13:36 - and you say when
13:38 - a healthy monster this is what you're
13:39 - seeing there
13:40 - touches a sick monster
13:43 - then
13:44 - you select
13:45 - the custom of that healthy monster is
13:48 - going to change its costume and that's
13:50 - custom is the the name of how in this
13:53 - case the monsters look it's going to
13:55 - change his custom to appear as
13:58 - sick
14:00 - so let's run the simulation and see what
14:02 - happens there
14:07 - so you see
14:09 - that one monster that touched another
14:11 - one got sick
14:12 - now oh there's no one
14:15 - i know it's moving a little bit slow but
14:17 - slowly look wow
14:19 - what happened there so
14:22 - what did you saw there natalia in that
14:25 - simulation
14:27 - well what happened was when the healthy
14:30 - monster got in contact with the sick
14:33 - monster that caused that healthy monster
14:35 - to become sick and when more healthy
14:38 - monsters got sick it was
14:40 - it was harder to control
14:42 - and
14:42 - some of the cool features of running a
14:45 - simulation in this case with sprite lab
14:47 - is that every time we run
14:49 - it the way in which things happen are
14:52 - different so
14:53 - why don't we run it again just to see
14:55 - what happens now
15:00 - oh wow
15:04 - so now for starters we had more sick
15:06 - monsters at the beginning and then very
15:08 - quickly
15:10 - almost all of them got sick
15:14 - so
15:15 - so that's that was one of our events uh
15:18 - in which
15:19 - we saw how the virus is spreading
15:23 - while the monsters are touching each
15:25 - other
15:26 - now
15:27 - in real life
15:29 - during a pandemic what can you do about
15:32 - it is there anything that you can do
15:33 - about it
15:34 - well we could start with um wearing
15:37 - masks to protect ourselves so do you
15:40 - think that's a good idea that the
15:41 - monsters start using masks in our
15:43 - simulation yeah
15:45 - okay so let's generate another event now
15:49 - uh in which
15:51 - let's go to the next level
15:54 - in which we're going to create this
15:57 - other event
15:58 - and yeah we need to start over sometimes
16:02 - when you are using sprite lab and if
16:04 - you're using it several times it saves
16:07 - part of the work that you do and if
16:08 - that's the case then it's good to just
16:10 - click over there and start over like we
16:12 - did right now so you see that now we
16:14 - have these new blocks you see these two
16:16 - blocks that says
16:18 - when healthy monster is clicked
16:21 - so yeah you're gonna put it there so
16:23 - that we can see what you're doing
16:25 - and then what happens what do we need we
16:27 - need an action right
16:29 - yeah an event let's see
16:33 - exactly
16:35 - when no go to actions yeah
16:38 - okay
16:39 - when
16:41 - so the event is when we click
16:43 - that's the event that means that when we
16:45 - click the healthy monster then that
16:47 - produces a change in behavior which in
16:49 - this case is the healthy monster is
16:51 - going to
16:52 - cover the mouth with a face mask
16:57 - we probably should think about doing
16:58 - something with the
17:00 - with the sick monsters as well
17:02 - yeah put masks on them too so they don't
17:04 - spread exactly because we also have
17:06 - discovered that during a pandemic when
17:09 - you put a mask to the monsters that are
17:13 - the people in this case that are sick
17:15 - then you actually can prevent the virus
17:18 - from spreading so what natalia just did
17:20 - is she created two more events that are
17:23 - gonna be when you click on a monster
17:25 - whether it's healthy or unhealthy
17:28 - they're gonna be covered with a base mac
17:31 - mask so that is going to actually
17:33 - require for you
17:35 - to do things what you see here is now we
17:37 - have several events going on when they
17:39 - touch each other they're going to infect
17:42 - each other
17:43 - but when you do a click you're going to
17:45 - be able to prevent that from happening
17:47 - but by putting a mask let's try that
17:58 - see okay
18:01 - so what happened
18:03 - in that in that simulation
18:06 - well i tried to get as many healthy
18:08 - monsters as i can but i also wasn't able
18:11 - to save every single healthy monster
18:13 - from getting infected
18:15 - exactly so you were trying quickly to
18:18 - put masks on the healthy ones and they
18:21 - kind of got spared
18:22 - from the virus but then there was a few
18:26 - of them that you didn't cover and they
18:28 - actually got infected
18:30 - um
18:31 - do you think we could have a better
18:33 - strategy for this is there anything else
18:36 - that we should be trying
18:37 - what if i click the sick monsters first
18:41 - liking the healthy ones
18:42 - yeah let's see let's see what happens if
18:44 - you do that
18:49 - now just put cover a few of the others
18:51 - just in case but let's see let's see
18:53 - what happens well it's not really doing
18:55 - anything to the healthy monsters
19:01 - because the sick monster is wearing
19:03 - masks therefore
19:04 - exactly so that was actually a good
19:06 - strategy in your simulation you
19:08 - discovered that if you target the sick
19:11 - monsters first and you put a mask then
19:13 - you can actually prevent from everyone
19:15 - else to to to get infected you still put
19:18 - a mask in a few others just for
19:21 - for safety but but that's actually a
19:23 - good strategy and and in real life we
19:25 - see that as well you know that's some of
19:28 - the things that we're doing right now uh
19:30 - in the united states and around the
19:32 - world many of us are wearing masks
19:35 - and it's even extra important to wear a
19:38 - mask when you are actually have symptoms
19:40 - in when you are sick
19:41 - so so that's a great way for you to
19:44 - continue doing a simulation
19:48 - natalia what are the
19:49 - what other things we didn't
19:52 - we didn't consider or we haven't done in
19:54 - our simulation
19:56 - well there wasn't the variable of how
19:57 - much time the infected monsters would
20:00 - remain infected
20:02 - well that's a good point because when
20:04 - you're sick you don't stay sick forever
20:06 - right
20:07 - so you may be sick for a few days or for
20:10 - a few weeks
20:11 - so in your simulation you could decide
20:14 - if you want to make the monster sick for
20:15 - an ex
20:17 - a specific amount of time and then they
20:19 - get healthy again what else well
20:22 - could you do in a simulation well we
20:24 - didn't put in the vaccine
20:27 - you could create a vaccine and you could
20:29 - vaccinate some of the monsters and that
20:32 - would be an even stronger way to
20:35 - keep them protected in addition to the
20:37 - mask
20:39 - those are things that a simulation
20:41 - allows you to do so let's let's not stop
20:45 - sharing the
20:47 - screen
20:49 - and and that those are the types of
20:51 - things that all of you can actually do
20:54 - with with sprite lab so the simulation
20:56 - is about trying to figure out uh
21:00 - how to emulate reality in the best way
21:03 - possible and then trying and trying it
21:05 - again so that you can see the different
21:08 - ways in which
21:10 - in which things can happen and as you
21:12 - already saw in our simulation the way
21:14 - that the monsters move and everything
21:16 - are not always in the same
21:19 - way so
21:21 - we talked about vaccines we talk about
21:22 - time i think those are things that you
21:24 - can continue
21:25 - doing uh in sprite life with this
21:28 - outbreak activity we have a few polls uh
21:32 - that are gonna help us also just double
21:35 - check a couple of the concepts that we
21:37 - talked about here today one of them is
21:40 - event so
21:42 - i think we have a poll there
21:46 - or don't we
21:48 - there it is
21:49 - but which of these
21:51 - might be controlled by events
21:54 - so let's say playing the same game three
21:56 - times in a row
21:58 - when someone gets tagged that player
22:01 - becomes it
22:02 - or a baseball team practicing before a
22:06 - tournament
22:07 - wow now the overwhelming majority of you
22:10 - actually selected the right uh answer
22:13 - which is when someone gets tagged then
22:17 - that someone in that game becomes it
22:19 - that is a very clear example of an event
22:23 - we have a second uh poll just to talk
22:26 - about about simulations which is
22:29 - basically what we did here today
22:32 - with sprite lab so how can simulations
22:35 - be helpful
22:36 - in the real world
22:38 - we have three very interesting answers
22:39 - here simulations can help us understand
22:42 - the world around us
22:44 - simulations let us let you test out
22:47 - ideas quickly cheaply and safely
22:50 - and simulations are a way to model
22:53 - complex systems in an interactive way
22:59 - so
23:01 - you know this is a trick question
23:02 - because the the reality is that all
23:05 - three answers are correct almost half of
23:09 - you actually chose answer number one as
23:11 - a correct answer but all of you actually
23:14 - showed the correct answer as well
23:17 - simulations allow us to do all of that
23:20 - it is actually a great way for us to try
23:23 - and model something that we expect could
23:26 - happen in reality and and we're trying
23:28 - to figure out solutions when you have a
23:30 - problem a complex problem you go
23:33 - simulate the problem you try different
23:35 - solutions you model it and then and then
23:38 - you see what happens and after doing it
23:40 - a lot of times you probably have a
23:42 - better idea of what is it that is going
23:44 - to work in real life so that's why
23:46 - simulations are
23:48 - very important so
23:50 - this is all that we're gonna do today uh
23:52 - as an example the idea was to try to
23:55 - show you this brand new activity that we
23:58 - just released you know outbreak is new
24:01 - and you're one of the first ones that
24:04 - see uh this activity and you can play it
24:06 - on your own remember uh code.org
24:11 - outbreak go to our website go to our
24:14 - platform type code.org
24:17 - outbreak and you can spend some time
24:19 - with it i actually recommend that you
24:21 - spend quite
24:22 - some time so that you can run a lot of
24:24 - simulations and repeat the action so
24:27 - that you can see that every time that
24:29 - you do it it's gonna turn out a little
24:31 - bit differently
24:33 - so i want to thank you good job natalia
24:35 - for helping us code here do you have fun
24:38 - yeah it was a lot of fun it was a lot of
24:39 - fun right i especially like the monsters
24:41 - and the shapes they're so cool
24:44 - so thank you so much for joining us uh
24:47 - thank you so much for being part of
24:49 - doing an hour of code during computer
24:52 - science education week i invite you to
24:54 - continue doing outbreak and i invite you
24:57 - to explore all the other tutorials that
24:59 - we have in the code.org platform in all
25:02 - the curriculum that we have available
25:04 - for all of you to learn computer science
25:07 - which is a critical critical skill that
25:10 - you will need to be successful
25:12 - throughout all your life
25:14 - thank you
25:15 - oh and don't forget tomorrow we have
25:18 - another episode of code bytes and you if
25:21 - you come and join us you're going to
25:23 - learn how to do
25:24 - apps for good so
25:27 - please join us tomorrow for our next
25:28 - episode of code bytes bye everyone
25:44 - [Music]
25:50 - you
