00:10 - a constant is a variable containing a
00:12 - value that cannot be changed
00:15 - the ability to have a value that can
00:16 - never be modified is very useful
00:19 - one great example is the value of pi
00:22 - pi never changes it is what it is
00:25 - many of science's greatest
00:26 - accomplishments came as a result of
00:28 - being able to depend on a constant like
00:30 - pi
00:31 - if a calculation is made with a slightly
00:33 - different value of pi things could go
00:35 - drastically wrong
00:37 - in programming a constant allows us to
00:39 - create a variable that we can rely on to
00:41 - give consistent answers just like pie
00:44 - does
00:45 - we can create our own constants using
00:47 - the keyword final
00:49 - first write final
00:51 - then the data type
00:53 - then the name of the variable
00:54 - when a variable has the keyword final it
00:57 - is now a constant the program can't give
00:59 - it a new value
01:01 - constants follow a new naming rule write
01:04 - the variable name in all caps separating
01:06 - words by using underscores if necessary
01:09 - for example if we have a bakery with a
01:11 - fixed cost for the cookies we are
01:13 - selling we would create a constant by
01:15 - writing final double sugar underscore
01:18 - cookie underscore price equals 2.19
01:22 - the value of sugar cookie price can't
01:25 - change in our code sugar cookie price
01:27 - now has a constant value of 2.19
01:31 - we can then use the sugar cookie price
01:33 - constant variable anywhere we want to
01:35 - use the price like if we wanted to
01:37 - calculate a customer's total order if we
01:40 - try to change the value of a constant
01:42 - like our sugar cookie price we get an
01:44 - error
01:45 - this is a good thing it means we can
01:46 - count on any final variable having the
01:49 - exact same value that it was initially
01:51 - assigned
01:52 - final variables can also be static this
01:55 - means they can be accessed by any
01:57 - instance of a class at this bakery we
01:59 - have a child discount on all cookies
02:01 - which are instances of a cookie class no
02:04 - matter what cookie a child buys it will
02:06 - cost
02:07 - we can set that variable to be static
02:09 - and final
02:11 - we can now create constants using the
02:13 - keyword final wherever necessary
