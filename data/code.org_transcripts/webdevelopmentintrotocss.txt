00:10 - I'm Dani and I'm a curriculum writer at
Code.org. In college I took my interest
00:16 - in sports and combined it with my
interest in computer science and I
00:20 - worked on a robotics team and we
actually competed internationally so
00:23 - around the world. So I got to travel to
Istanbul and Mexico and I love how it
00:27 - connects every field and any interest
you have.
00:32 - As you've been building your websites, you've learn to use HTML to give it structure.
00:36 - We've learned to define
00:37 - headings, lists, paragraphs and images to make your website start to look the way you want.
00:45 - But usually just giving a
website structure isn't enough.
00:49 - You want to give it style to fully bring the
content to life.
00:53 - The same website about fitness could have a sleek and simple style or a quirky and eclectic style
01:00 - and each would feel different to your user.
01:04 - Web developers can control the style of
01:06 - a webpage using a language called CSS.
01:11 - CSS stands for cascading style sheets.
01:15 - CSS allows a web developer to define a
specific set of style rules to apply to HTML elements on the page .
01:25 - Let's take a look at how to use CSS to create style rules for a simple webpage about fitness.
01:30 - First we'll write the CSS to turn all the 
paragraph text purple.
01:35 - To indicate that
we want to apply a set of rules to all
01:39 - the paragraph elements, we write the name of the tag "p", followed by an open, and then a close curly brace.
01:48 - We refer to a "p"
here as the selector.
01:51 - The selector indicates the type of element that the style rule will apply to.
01:57 - Next, we need to indicate what about the 
paragraph we'd like to change.
02:01 - In this case, we want to change the color of the paragraph text.
02:05 - This part of the rule is called a property.
02:08 - And color is just one of the
many properties we can change about a paragraph.
02:13 - A property is followed by a
colon.
02:19 - Finally we need to specify the value we
want for that property.
02:24 - To make the paragraph purple, let's add the word
"purple" after the property and finally
02:29 - add a semicolon to indicate the end of the
style rule.
02:35 - The CSS that we just wrote is
02:37 - called a "Rule Set" because like the name
implies, it's a set of rules to specify a
02:42 - style for the selected element.
02:45 - We can add multiple properties value pairs to
02:49 - the same selector to further control the
style of our web pages paragraph elements.
02:55 - If we want these paragraphs to
be purple and large we can add the font
03:00 - size property to control the text size.
03:04 - Then specify a number value to set how
03:06 - large the font will be.
03:08 - CSS allows for
all sorts of style rules.
03:11 - Fonts,
03:13 - positioning, size and colors.
03:17 - The more
style rules you learn, the more you can
03:20 - make your web page tell the story you
want.
