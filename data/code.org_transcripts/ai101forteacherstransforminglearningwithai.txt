00:07 - hi welcome to session three of the AI
00:10 - 101 for teachers professional learning
00:12 - series
00:13 - in this session we are traveling to the
00:15 - Wharton School at the University of
00:17 - Pennsylvania to chat with Dr Ethan
00:19 - Mullick a professor who teaches
00:21 - Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Dr
00:24 - lilac Mullick who works on interactive
00:26 - pedagogy and AI research
00:29 - they will help us explore how AI can be
00:32 - combined with pedagogy to enhance
00:34 - student learning
00:36 - let's go meet the Molex
00:43 - hi I'm Ethan Malek a professor at
00:45 - Wharton who has been working on how we
00:48 - democratize access to education through
00:50 - tools like games and interactive tools
00:52 - and AI
00:54 - Nami and I'm director of pedagogy of
00:56 - Wharton interactive and I've been
00:57 - working at the intersection of AI and
00:59 - education helping to democratize
01:02 - education for everyone through effective
01:04 - pedagogically sound use of AI and we
01:07 - have been working together on the future
01:09 - of education for a while thinking about
01:11 - how to make education more interactive
01:14 - to work at scale and with the Advent of
01:16 - generative AI we've had a powerful new
01:18 - tool that can really help in the
01:20 - classroom but also carries some risks
01:22 - today we'd like to talk a little bit
01:23 - about the classroom use of AI upside to
01:26 - the downside to give you some examples
01:27 - to work with the first we like to start
01:30 - with our three guiding principles the
01:32 - first is that AI is undetectable there
01:34 - are AI tools detection tools but they
01:37 - are not effective the second principle
01:39 - is that AI is ubiquitous it's everywhere
01:43 - 169 countries have access to Bing chat
01:46 - and you and your students have access to
01:48 - the most powerful AI available
01:50 - the third principle is that AI is
01:53 - transformative it will transform how we
01:55 - live how we work and how we teach and
01:58 - learn
02:01 - foreign
02:02 - [Music]
02:04 - not going away but this is probably the
02:09 - worst AI you're ever going to use so if
02:11 - this feels disruptive now I kind of have
02:13 - bad news which is that there isn't a
02:15 - reason to suspect that AI development
02:16 - will not continue and I think people
02:17 - worry a lot about like the far future or
02:19 - who knows how far it is where AI is
02:22 - smarter than humans but even over the
02:23 - next couple years even of the fact of
02:25 - this Academic Year I would expect AI to
02:27 - continue to improve five times ten times
02:30 - we have no idea but if you're not
02:32 - already thinking about these systems
02:33 - what they mean for Education what they
02:35 - mean for you what they mean for your
02:36 - students careers I think we have to
02:38 - think about it because these systems are
02:39 - not going to disappear let me make the
02:41 - very pragmatic case for why you might
02:43 - want to do this for the first part of
02:45 - the pragmatic case is your students will
02:47 - be using this anyway so you have to come
02:49 - to speed I don't think everybody wants
02:50 - to be dragged along this technology no
02:52 - one asked for education to be massively
02:53 - disrupted but it is and unfortunately
02:55 - we've got to figure out a way to get
02:57 - around that all your homework
02:58 - assignments can be done by AI now so you
02:59 - have to think about that and then I
03:01 - think the second thing is the pragmatic
03:02 - argument about how AI can make your life
03:05 - easier as a teacher if you put the hours
03:06 - down you get them back later and if
03:08 - you've worked on a number of prompts to
03:09 - help make lives easier for teachers
03:11 - yeah so one thing you can do prompts
03:14 - like give me a lesson hook prompts like
03:16 - create a lesson plan
03:18 - um or Create a quiz for me so starting
03:20 - to work with your material and the
03:23 - different models can get you give you a
03:24 - really good sense of how the AI Works
03:26 - what is good at what it what it's not
03:28 - good at and so and save you time in the
03:31 - end right so that's where I would be my
03:33 - push to teachers is a you have to and B
03:35 - you're going to want to
03:37 - I think the other important thing is
03:39 - just to try it they're very simple to
03:42 - use they're very intuitive because
03:43 - they're conversational uh you can
03:46 - continue a conversation it feels fairly
03:48 - natural and I think the the key really
03:51 - is experimentation see how it works with
03:54 - you see how it works within your context
03:56 - within your topic that you teach our
03:59 - rule of thumb is you need about 10 hours
04:00 - playing with AI to get what it's good
04:02 - and what its limitations are so I would
04:04 - actually start by suggesting that this
04:06 - that the teacher throw their own
04:08 - assignments into the AI and see what
04:09 - kind of results they get back I would
04:11 - think about asking them uh to ask their
04:14 - students to create an assignment using
04:16 - Ai and then critique that assignment
04:18 - potentially even in class to see for the
04:20 - students can get a sense of what the
04:22 - gaps and abilities of AI are I have a
04:24 - little bit of Freedom as an instructor
04:26 - because I'm teaching college and MBA
04:28 - students entrepreneurship so I have a
04:30 - lot of I have points I want them to make
04:32 - but they also are building things and
04:33 - doing things and ai's absolutely
04:35 - transformed how that works so
04:38 - um my assignments now literally call for
04:39 - students to do at least one impossible
04:41 - thing in class if you can't code you
04:43 - have to write working programs if you
04:44 - have never if you can't do design work
04:46 - you have to create a full graphic design
04:48 - working prototypes that's literally that
04:50 - part of the class so where it used to be
04:51 - right up write a little bit of an essay
04:53 - do a prototype on paper now you have to
04:55 - create a full working product every
04:57 - assignment that they turn in has to be
04:58 - critiqued by at least five famous
05:00 - entrepreneurs through history and they
05:01 - use AI to invoke those there's a
05:03 - pedagogical reason too which is that
05:04 - entrepreneurs tend to be overconfident
05:06 - so you want feedback from different
05:08 - sources so to me it is let me teach 10
05:11 - times more than I did I used to teach
05:12 - Advanced intermediate entrepreneurship
05:14 - course I can now in the intermediate or
05:16 - basic course get all the way past the
05:18 - advanced material and further so I think
05:20 - we're going to see that shake out more
05:21 - in the future but some of this is about
05:23 - powering a past what we could do before
05:24 - and I think that's exciting as well
05:27 - apart from student tutors as AI
05:29 - assignments teachers can certainly use
05:31 - AI coaches and AI assistants to help
05:35 - students prepare for discussions help
05:37 - students outline help students do
05:39 - research help students get feedback on
05:41 - assignments and just help students
05:43 - develop explanations I think there are
05:46 - Myriad of approaches that are
05:48 - pedagogically sound
05:49 - that teachers can assign to students and
05:52 - watch their work and ask for the back
05:55 - and forth interaction to really see that
05:57 - students are paying attention to and
05:58 - focusing on the material
06:02 - foreign
06:03 - [Music]
06:07 - teacher's perspective so because of the
06:10 - ubiquity of AI you've got some choices
06:12 - to make in terms of your AI policies in
06:14 - your class so do you want to permit AI
06:16 - do you want to forbid AI how are you
06:18 - going to enforce these sets of things
06:19 - we're going to assume that you want to
06:21 - use AI to some extent and we'll dive
06:23 - into a little bit of the details here so
06:25 - as a instructor you should know a few
06:27 - things one is there's obviously ongoing
06:29 - ethical debates about Ai and those are
06:31 - complicated debates there are debates
06:33 - over whether or not the AI is trained on
06:35 - the right kind of data about the biases
06:37 - AI might have about the use of AI and
06:40 - the outcomes for student learning and
06:42 - it's worth acknowledging these sets of
06:44 - things but this tool is out there and it
06:46 - is worth thinking about how you want to
06:47 - use it if you decide that that is okay
06:49 - and how you want to communicate that
06:51 - information beyond the initial ethical
06:53 - concerns there's also concerns about how
06:56 - AI actually works so the large language
06:59 - models that power today's AI don't
07:01 - actually have knowledge of the world
07:03 - they're predicting the next word they're
07:05 - predicting the right kinds of sentences
07:06 - or information to give out and as a
07:08 - result they make stuff up they would
07:11 - call hallucinate so there are often
07:12 - errors or mistakes now it's not always
07:14 - clear those errors or mistakes are worse
07:15 - than the errors and mistakes humans
07:17 - would make but you need to be aware that
07:18 - there's going to be those kind of errors
07:20 - and mistakes and then finally you need
07:22 - to think about as a instructor how
07:24 - you're going to be using AI to Aid
07:26 - learning which means being really clear
07:28 - about what you want to accomplish with
07:30 - an AI tool they can be boost for student
07:32 - learning but ai's many possible uses in
07:35 - classroom so do you want to use them to
07:36 - have students generate ideas which I do
07:38 - in my classes and we get better project
07:40 - ideas as a result do you want them to
07:42 - use them as tutors to explain Concepts
07:44 - to them they don't understand do you
07:46 - want these students to get feedback from
07:48 - AI by asking it for questions about work
07:51 - that they're doing do you want to be a
07:52 - writing companion do you wanted to
07:54 - explain why quiz answers might be right
07:56 - or wrong and then once you've decided
07:57 - what to do as an instructor you need to
07:59 - decide what you're going to tell your
08:01 - students
08:06 - [Music]
08:07 - AI detectors don't work they just don't
08:10 - work you shouldn't use them and it's
08:11 - worse than them not working because they
08:13 - have a high false positive rate that
08:15 - means they flag things as AI written
08:17 - that aren't AI written and that
08:19 - disproportionately falls on people whose
08:21 - English is a second language this is
08:23 - just not something that we can do and I
08:25 - think trying to close the barn door here
08:27 - after it's been opened and try and
08:29 - detect AI is not the future for
08:31 - responsibility in classrooms the the
08:34 - other thing to note too is that students
08:36 - were using shortcuts in the past it's
08:39 - not that they weren't using Google it's
08:40 - so that they weren't using you know
08:42 - other students essays this was happening
08:43 - in the past but this is a major
08:45 - disruption and I think it does call for
08:47 - a rethinking of how we do essays so
08:50 - thinking a little bit more about the
08:52 - learning goal for an essay or the
08:54 - learning goal for any assignments
09:00 - [Music]
09:02 - one of the things that we're noticing as
09:04 - we watch teachers do this is they all
09:06 - feel an obligation to talk about Ai and
09:09 - dive deep into the ethical implications
09:10 - of AI and so on I think that's important
09:13 - but I don't think it needs to be the
09:15 - theme of every class I don't think every
09:16 - class needs to be a discussion about AI
09:18 - just like every class that uses
09:20 - computers doesn't need to be a
09:21 - discussion about computers I think it's
09:23 - important to have that conversation and
09:24 - right now we're all just reacting so
09:26 - it's not clear who's supposed to have
09:28 - that so I totally get teachers wanting
09:30 - to have ai discussions but it's even
09:31 - harder to come up to speed not just on
09:34 - the use of AI but how it works it's you
09:37 - know standards it's ethical implications
09:39 - so I think teachers should feel a little
09:41 - bit of um okayness with experimenting
09:44 - with AI without having to make it the
09:45 - subject of class
09:48 - foreign
09:51 - [Music]
09:53 - first is as Ethan mentioned that AI can
09:55 - fabricate that means that any output
09:57 - that the AI gives a student may be made
10:00 - up it may be mistaken it may be very
10:03 - subtly mistaken and so students should
10:05 - be responsible for their own work they
10:08 - should at the very least check sources
10:09 - check any number check any facts that
10:12 - the AI gives them and check them with
10:13 - credible sources the second principle is
10:16 - that the AI is not a person it's easy to
10:19 - imbue the AI with a personality or to
10:21 - feel like you're talking to a person but
10:23 - it's not a person and it doesn't know
10:25 - you the third principle is really to
10:28 - give it a lot of context the AI doesn't
10:30 - know you it doesn't know your context or
10:32 - your experience or your expertise the
10:34 - more context you give it the more useful
10:37 - it'll be for you and the fourth
10:38 - principle is that you're in charge not
10:41 - only should you evaluate and interrogate
10:43 - its output but if it's leading you in a
10:45 - conversation that is no longer useful to
10:48 - to you or if it's stuck in a loop or if
10:50 - you'd like to change the direction of
10:51 - the conversation you should ask feel
10:54 - free to take charge
10:57 - thank you
10:58 - [Music]
11:01 - so when we talk about Ai and these
11:05 - generative AI Solutions we tend to talk
11:08 - about large language models and there's
11:10 - actually only a few large-scale general
11:12 - purpose large language models there is
11:14 - the models created by openai which are
11:17 - GPT 3.5 or gbt4 gbd 3.5 is the free
11:20 - version that you get through uh through
11:23 - chat CBT and gbt4 is either through the
11:26 - page chat gbt or through Microsoft Bing
11:29 - in creative mode and when we talk about
11:32 - specialized apps almost all of them are
11:34 - using one of these models and providing
11:36 - prompts and other information on top of
11:38 - it I generally think instructors should
11:41 - get familiar with the models themselves
11:42 - because those are the models that are
11:45 - actually producing the answers and you
11:47 - can manipulate them directly that way
11:48 - and learn how they work so if you're
11:50 - trying to buy an off-the-shelf solution
11:51 - they're almost only using one of these
11:53 - existing models and then providing some
11:55 - sort of wrapper or other information on
11:57 - top of it and it's often cheaper and
11:58 - more effective and gives you more
12:00 - control to use the foundation models
12:02 - yourself but that's a choice you get to
12:04 - make so when develop helping the prompt
12:06 - we really and for all of our prompts we
12:09 - really look at the science of learning
12:11 - and try to combine that with the power
12:14 - of the AI so for instance a good tutor
12:16 - pushes you for information uh it doesn't
12:19 - just hand it to you a good tutor finds
12:22 - out what you know and builds on that
12:24 - prior knowledge
12:25 - a good tutor will also find out a little
12:29 - bit about you a good tutor also knows
12:31 - that you need lots and varied kinds of
12:33 - examples and analogies and a good tutor
12:37 - knows that the way that you show
12:39 - evidence of Mastery is by being able to
12:41 - explain something in your own words to
12:44 - someone else and give an example of it
12:46 - which is exactly these are exactly the
12:48 - steps and the kinds of questions that we
12:51 - use in the tutor prompt but you'll
12:53 - notice when you look at our prompts that
12:54 - they do things like provide context to
12:56 - the AI as Leo has discussed already the
12:58 - idea that it it asks you who you are and
13:01 - we tell the AI who it is it's an
13:03 - instructor with this kind of setting
13:04 - you'll notice that it also tells it
13:07 - exactly the scientific framework to use
13:09 - this idea of context matters we provide
13:12 - controls we ask it to go step by step
13:14 - through sets of questions to ask
13:16 - sometimes not in these prompts we
13:17 - provide examples of good output and then
13:19 - we test it a lot you can't do prompting
13:22 - without testing and that's one of the
13:23 - great things about testing your
13:24 - expertise it's cheap to do and so you
13:27 - get to experiment a lot and that makes
13:29 - for good prompts and and we should also
13:31 - say we tested not just on one model but
13:33 - on several models so for instance these
13:36 - two prompts we just worked with chat
13:38 - gpt4 they also work with Bing Bing will
13:41 - react a little bit differently and it
13:44 - will um because it's connected to the
13:46 - internet it will also look up citations
13:47 - sometimes they're the right citations
13:49 - sometimes they're not but that is
13:50 - available it may or may not work with
13:53 - some of the other models so you really
13:54 - have to test it I think as an instructor
13:56 - before you give it to your students in
13:59 - the context of the topic that you're
14:01 - teaching to see how it works so this is
14:03 - all very theoretical but I think
14:04 - important so let's let's get practical
14:06 - let's talk about some examples of what
14:08 - AI can do and again this isn't a
14:10 - monolithical thing a AI has many
14:12 - possible uses as we said it was
14:14 - transformative earlier so we're going to
14:15 - show you a couple of prompts that we've
14:17 - created and those will be available to
14:18 - you as well to work with and these are
14:22 - just examples of the ways AI classroom
14:25 - use can work so the first one we want to
14:27 - show you is a prompt that I believe you
14:29 - created that talks about uh feedback
14:31 - that gives proper feedback and
14:34 - one of the really interesting things
14:35 - about the AI side of things is a more
14:37 - sophisticated prompt that takes into
14:38 - account some of the principles we were
14:40 - talking about earlier will result in
14:41 - better outcomes so students will often
14:43 - ask for writing advice from an AI even
14:44 - if you tell them not to do it but
14:46 - they're going to ask for it in a way
14:47 - that's fairly unsophisticated and is
14:48 - going to give them fairly generic
14:49 - sounding work and possibly more mistakes
14:51 - if you give a more elaborate prompt you
14:54 - can get more elaborate answers so in
14:55 - this case could you explain what this
14:56 - prompt does the feedback prompt yes so
14:59 - we combine the principles of good
15:02 - feedback which is feedback that takes
15:04 - into account your prior knowledge or
15:06 - what you already know from the student
15:08 - perspective takes into account who you
15:10 - are your learning level what grade
15:12 - you're in uh whether you're in college
15:14 - or you're a professional and it also
15:17 - takes into account uh the idea that you
15:19 - want to respond to this feedback so it
15:22 - is going to be actionable it's going to
15:24 - be balanced it's going to tell you
15:25 - what's wrong and what you can improve on
15:27 - and what you're doing well and it's
15:30 - going to keep working with you but like
15:31 - any good tutor or coach it won't
15:34 - actually give you the answer it'll push
15:36 - you in that direction ask you to explain
15:38 - ask you to construct your own knowledge
15:40 - and so you can see the prompt hopefully
15:43 - on the screen here uh and uh as a place
15:46 - to work from you don't need to take this
15:48 - as an absolute answer this is something
15:50 - you can play with but let's see it in
15:51 - action so let's get started using this
15:53 - prompt it says that it's a teaching
15:55 - assistant because that's the
15:56 - instructions we gave it and it asks us
15:58 - for our grade level and subject we're
16:00 - studying what should we say so I think
16:02 - we're studying Macbeth and we're in 12th
16:05 - grade in 12th grade okay great
16:11 - okay and so we've told the AI as
16:14 - information it's feeding it into the
16:16 - logic that it's using here and it's
16:18 - asking us about a specific assignment
16:20 - um and it's asking if we have a rubric
16:22 - or other information to work with or
16:23 - what we're hoping to achieve with uh
16:25 - with as much of Rage as possible I don't
16:27 - have a huge amount here so I'll say I
16:29 - have to write an analysis of Macbeth
16:35 - it is graded
16:38 - based on
16:40 - writing style and depth of content
16:46 - and you'll see what it's going is it's
16:47 - asking us questions soliciting
16:49 - information from us which makes it a
16:51 - kind of a good prompt that you might
16:52 - hand a student better than one that is
16:54 - just they're just developing themselves
16:56 - and it's asking about Specific
16:57 - Instructions and as gets to share the
16:59 - assignment uh here is what I have
17:01 - written so far
17:05 - and I have asked the AI to generate a
17:08 - Macbeth essay so here we go I'm just
17:11 - pasting that in
17:13 - and we'll see what it says here and
17:14 - you'll notice it's it's it's working on
17:17 - the information it's saying it's taking
17:18 - time to carefully read through it that's
17:19 - a bit of an illusion it's obviously not
17:21 - taking any extra time but uh it's
17:23 - responding in this method and you'll see
17:24 - it's giving a set of strengths and
17:25 - weaknesses what's great about again
17:27 - using a tutor that you've built or a
17:29 - mentor that you built is that it can
17:31 - give you the kind of feedback that's
17:32 - educationally valuable that ties into
17:34 - pedagogy rather than just students
17:36 - asking make this essay better a nice
17:38 - example of AI working in your favor uh
17:41 - as an educator and not necessarily
17:43 - working against you and undermining the
17:44 - points you're making
17:46 - so you'll notice at the End by the way
17:48 - it gives a question that you for the
17:51 - student's answer so how do you plan to
17:53 - revise your analysis give me a plan on
17:55 - specific changes you're going to make
17:56 - again the kind of thing we would do as
17:58 - an instructor in our classroom
17:59 - soliciting changes or differences so I
18:02 - think you can start to see why a uh tool
18:06 - like this can be really useful when
18:08 - properly applied now let's also talk
18:11 - about one other potential use for ai ai
18:13 - as a tutor what are some of the
18:14 - advantages of disadvantage of that
18:15 - approach so an advantage of this
18:17 - approach is that you're getting students
18:19 - to actually pay attention to the
18:20 - material you're getting them to read
18:22 - over the rubric to read over the purpose
18:25 - of the essay and the audience and to
18:27 - really think through it a disadvantage
18:30 - is that you you certainly can ask the AI
18:33 - to do it for you but if you work with it
18:36 - and if you're given guidelines to work
18:37 - with it it's one way to get feedback
18:40 - that you would then have to evaluate
18:42 - something else that a teacher could do
18:44 - is to ask for the interaction and ask
18:46 - for a reflection about the interactions
18:48 - what about this feedback was good what
18:50 - about this feedback was not as good and
18:52 - again it's a higher order level thinking
18:54 - about your essay and and your process
18:58 - excellent and so I want to show you one
19:01 - other example where the AI acts as a
19:02 - direct instructor and we have a prompt
19:05 - for that as well there are risks
19:07 - associated with asking the AI to be a
19:09 - direct instructor which is that
19:10 - hallucination risk it doesn't know your
19:12 - pedagogy your your your perspective but
19:15 - I find in my classrooms that students
19:17 - are increasingly using the AI as a
19:20 - method of learning so they don't raise
19:21 - their hands as much I'm going to ask
19:23 - them why they're like well I'd rather
19:24 - not show my evenings in class I could
19:25 - ask the AI to explain like I'm five so
19:28 - they're already engaging this Behavior
19:29 - so something like a tutor both does a
19:32 - useful thing of showing you what the
19:33 - future of AI education might look like
19:35 - uh like the way Khan Academy is building
19:38 - AI interactive tutors to work and it
19:40 - also might be a tool your students can
19:42 - use to achieve more in class but you
19:44 - should caveat that with the knowledge
19:45 - that AI tutors are not 100 there yet but
19:48 - let's let's use an example here so this
19:50 - tutor is again trying to take the right
19:52 - kind of format it says hello there I'm
19:53 - your AI tutor and I'm excited to work
19:54 - with you today what do we want to learn
19:56 - about today
19:59 - opportunity cost the concept from
20:01 - economics let's see what happens
20:04 - okay so we're telling the AI where the
20:06 - opportunity cost it's saying it is a key
20:08 - concept of Economics that's even throw a
20:10 - little Emoji here which is cute uh can
20:12 - you ask us about our learning level what
20:14 - level are we at here 11th grade 11th
20:17 - grade
20:18 - now I wouldn't get too tied up on the
20:20 - individual grade it's not amazing at
20:22 - differentiating a 10th grader from 11th
20:24 - grader but this is part of the context
20:25 - in which it's working and so it's not
20:27 - pulling from some sort of universal
20:28 - standards here and it says what do we
20:31 - know about opportunity cost
20:34 - well we know that it has to do with
20:36 - choices has to do with alternative
20:40 - choices
20:41 - that is it and of course the advance one
20:44 - of the advantages of AI is this kind of
20:45 - freeform texted interaction is the real
20:48 - power of education and it's something
20:50 - the AI can fake reasonably well again
20:52 - not as well as a real human instructor
20:54 - yet and you'll notice it's giving us
20:56 - examples and explaining things in
20:59 - different ways which is a powerful thing
21:01 - that AI can do it's very good at
21:03 - breaking things down in different ways
21:04 - but you'll notice that it's now starting
21:06 - to ask questions it's asking us to make
21:08 - choices so one of the things we know
21:10 - from the research on tutoring is you
21:12 - can't just declaim things to people the
21:14 - advantage of tutoring comes from
21:15 - soliciting information making
21:16 - connections and you can see the AI
21:18 - starting to do this and asking us for
21:19 - Connections in our own life the other
21:21 - thing to mention too about the Tudor
21:23 - prompt is that it is not assuming that
21:26 - the student can judge their own learning
21:28 - uh very often you'll see in a tutor
21:31 - prompt that is very simple like explain
21:33 - to me like I'm 10 It'll ask you if you
21:35 - understand something instead here it's
21:37 - not asking you to make a judgment about
21:39 - your own learning which we know is
21:40 - inherently flawed instead it's
21:42 - soliciting as Ethan said soliciting
21:44 - information from you to find out what
21:46 - you know and to help you build on your
21:48 - knowledge and these sorts of subtle
21:50 - differences are what separates
21:53 - using AI in sort of an expert way in a
21:56 - classroom where we know what we want to
21:58 - have happen from just the naive use
22:00 - people are doing
22:04 - [Music]
22:06 - I I think that there is an advantage to
22:08 - taking charge of your students AI usage
22:10 - because they're going to be using it
22:11 - anyway and thinking about directing it
22:13 - either by giving them prompts having
22:14 - these discussions and it's a really
22:16 - powerful tool that in the future will
22:18 - greatly boost classroom learning and is
22:20 - not a replacement or threat for students
22:22 - for teachers it is something that we can
22:24 - use to improve the outputs of our work
22:27 - improve student learning make our lives
22:29 - easier while making students lives
22:31 - better and I think that that's a very
22:33 - powerful view of the future and I hope
22:35 - that you at least Embrace that
22:36 - experiment with AI before deciding
22:38 - whether you want to use it or ban it in
22:39 - your classrooms
22:41 - wow there really are so many ways to
22:43 - enhance student learning using AI
22:46 - with AI technology advancing rapidly
22:48 - there will be more and more tools
22:50 - available as with any new tool Educators
22:53 - have a responsibility to ensure they are
22:55 - using age-appropriate tools
22:57 - protecting student privacy and creating
23:01 - spaces for students to critically
23:02 - evaluate the potential of pitfalls of
23:05 - the technology they are using join us in
23:08 - session four ensuring a responsible
23:10 - approach to AI as we explore these
