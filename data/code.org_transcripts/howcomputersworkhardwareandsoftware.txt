00:08 - Hi, my name is Erica Gomez and I'm an engineering manager at Amazon.com.
00:12 - One of the best things about working in tech, and at Amazon in particular, is that I get to bring my dog with me to work every day.
00:19 - My job is to help make sure software gets out the door
00:23 - and her job is to nap under my desk and snore very loudly.
00:28 - My name is Jerome Holman, and I'm a Program Manager on Team Xbox and I have a really fun job:
00:34 - Basically bringing the hardware and the software together to give you all the games that you love on your Xbox.
00:45 - When you look inside a computing device you see a bunch of circuits, chips, wires,
00:50 - speakers, plugs, and all sorts of other stuff.
00:54 - This is the hardware.
00:56 - But what you don't see is the software.
00:59 - Software is all of the computer programs, or code, running on this machine.
01:04 - The software can be anything from apps and games
01:07 - to webpages and the data science software that me and my teams use at Amazon to understand how customers behave.
01:13 - But how do the hardware and the software interact with one another?
01:18 - Let's start at looking at a computer's central processing unit, or CPU.
01:23 - The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.
01:29 - A CPU needs to do different things so inside it has smaller, simpler parts that handle specific tasks.
01:38 - It has circuits to do simple math and logic.
01:41 - It has other circuits to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer.
01:49 - The real magic of the CPU is how it knows which circuits to use and when to use them.
01:57 - The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.
02:03 - For example, an "add" command tells the CPU to use its outer circuit to calculate a new number.
02:09 - And then the "store" command tells the CPU to use a different circuit to save that result into memory.
02:15 - Just like numbers, all of these simple commands can be represented in binary ones and zeros
02:21 - or on and off electrical signals.
02:26 - The binary commands are stored in memory and the CPU fetches and executes them in sequence one after the other.
02:35 - This sequence of commands is, in fact, a very simple computer program.
02:40 - Binary code is the most basic form of software and it controls all the hardware of a computer.
02:47 - These days, nobody writes software in binary. It would take forever!
02:52 - Today, the software we write looks more like
02:55 - this,
02:57 - or this,
02:58 - or even this.
03:00 - Programming languages like these let you type in commands in something that looks a lot like English.
03:07 - To draw a rectangle on the screen, you just need a single command.
03:13 - This high-level command is converted into hundreds, or thousands, of simpler binary commands that the CPU understands.
03:25 - Software tells the CPU what to do,
03:27 - but when you're listening to music, and browsing the web, and chatting with a friend, your computer is running multiple pieces of software all at once.
03:37 - So, how do all of these programs get on the computer in the first place, and how can the CPU run them all at once?
03:43 - To find out we'll have to take a look at the operating system.
03:48 - The operating system of the computer is the master program that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
03:55 - For example, I helped create the Windows operating system that runs on most personal computers.
04:02 - The operating system is a program with special abilities that let it control the other software on the computer.
04:09 - It lets you install new programs by loading them into your computer's memory.
04:14 - It decides when a program is run by the central processing unit, and whether that program can access the computer's input and output devices.
04:22 - And when you think your computer is running many programs at once,
04:26 - in reality, it's the operating system that's quickly switching between programs sharing that CPU for fractions of a second.
04:35 - Inside every computer is an operating system managing software that controls the computer's hardware.
04:40 - The software is a series of commands made of simple binary code,
04:44 - and that binary code is just electrical signals flowing through billions of tiny circuits.
04:50 - Computers have the potential to do all kinds of amazing things.
04:54 - But the only thing that makes the computer smart, or useful, is you.
04:59 - When you learn to code you get to define the problem you want to solve, and write the software that turns those ideas into reality.
05:06 - That gives you the power to build things that matter to you, your community, and the world.
