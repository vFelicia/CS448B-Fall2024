00:05 - my name is Ali Chase and I am an
00:07 - oceanographer at the University of
00:09 - Washington I study microscopic plankton
00:12 - in the water near the ocean surface part
00:14 - of my job is to study how well the
00:16 - ocean's ecosystem is balanced which
00:18 - means measuring different organisms in
00:20 - the food chain let's look at this basic
00:22 - model of a marine life ecosystem
00:24 - we have Coral algae and fish
00:29 - the fish eat the algae and the right
00:31 - amount of algae keep the coral healthy
00:34 - Coral protects our coastlines and is a
00:36 - home for fish
00:38 - in today's lesson you'll create a
00:40 - computer simulation of a simple marine
00:42 - life ecosystem at risk of overfishing by
00:45 - humans overfishing occurs when fish are
00:48 - caught faster than they can reproduce if
00:50 - there aren't enough fish then the algae
00:52 - take over if the algae take over then
00:54 - the coral dies if the coral dies then
00:57 - the fish don't have a home and our
00:59 - coastlines are at risk of Destruction
01:02 - this is a cause and effect relationship
01:04 - but there's good news we can practice
01:07 - sustainable fishing practices
01:09 - sustainability is our ability to keep
01:12 - the balance of our natural environment
01:14 - and protect it from harm in this case
01:16 - not taking too many fish at one time
01:19 - over the next few lessons you'll learn
01:21 - how to create a model of a simple marine
01:24 - life ecosystem with code this model will
01:26 - allow you to change different parameters
01:28 - like how many fish you start with or
01:31 - when the fishing boat comes you can
01:33 - change this model to observe different
01:34 - simulations of this ecosystem once you
01:37 - have a working model you can problem
01:39 - solve to find ways humans can practice
01:42 - sustainable fishing to keep our oceans
01:44 - healthy for the future
01:45 - with code you can observe natural
01:48 - phenomena without leaving your computer
01:49 - although I do hope you visit an aquarium
01:52 - to observe sea creatures in real life
01:54 - too
