00:10 - hi my name is porva i am a lead product
00:13 - manager at uber the work that i'm doing
00:16 - does have an impact on such a large
00:18 - scale of people back when i was at
00:20 - microsoft working on windows literally
00:23 - the stuff i was touching hundreds of
00:24 - millions of people were seeing that and
00:26 - honestly that just sometimes makes you
00:28 - nervous but it's also so exciting that
00:31 - you can be working with a small team of
00:33 - people and literally be doing something
00:35 - that touches the lives of so many people
00:39 - a 2d array stores elements in a table
00:42 - consisting of rows and columns
00:45 - when we want to access elements in the
00:47 - 2d array we can either move row by row
00:50 - or column by column
00:53 - row major order is the process of
00:55 - traversing a 2d array by accessing each
00:58 - row from top to bottom
01:01 - let's say your teacher gives a daily
01:02 - quiz in their class they track the
01:04 - student's scores in a 2d array
01:08 - each row represents an individual
01:10 - student
01:11 - each column represents the score for
01:14 - that day
01:15 - to get each student's scores for the
01:17 - entire week we can access the row for
01:20 - each student
01:22 - this is traversing the 2d array in row
01:24 - major order
01:27 - to set up this kind of traversal in java
01:29 - we need to use two nested for loops
01:33 - the outer loop will traverse each row in
01:35 - the 2d array
01:37 - it starts at index 0 and repeats for the
01:40 - number of rows
01:42 - the number of rows is equal to the
01:44 - length of the outer array
01:46 - the inner loop will traverse each column
01:48 - in the current row
01:50 - it also starts at index 0 and repeats
01:53 - for the number of columns in the row
01:55 - the number of columns is equal to the
01:57 - length of the inner array
01:59 - we use index 0 to refer to the first row
02:02 - and get its length
02:04 - if we include a print statement and run
02:06 - the code
02:08 - the outer loop would start with row 0
02:10 - and the inner loop would iterate through
02:12 - each column
02:14 - once we traverse a full row the inner
02:16 - for loop is done the outer loop now
02:19 - increments the value of rho to move us
02:21 - down to the next row
02:24 - now the inner loop repeats starting over
02:26 - at column zero and moves through the
02:29 - array
02:30 - this process continues until the outer
02:32 - loop reaches the last
02:34 - row
02:36 - when we access data by traversing each
02:39 - full row from top to bottom we are
02:41 - traversing in row major order

02:52 - you
