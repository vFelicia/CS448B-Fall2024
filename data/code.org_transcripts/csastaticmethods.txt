00:10 - calling methods from a class typically
00:12 - requires an object to be created first
00:15 - these methods are called instinct
00:17 - methods
00:18 - an instance method is a method that
00:21 - requires an object of this class to be
00:24 - created before it can be called
00:26 - sometimes we have methods that don't use
00:29 - any instance variables and don't depend
00:31 - on a specific object these can use
00:34 - static methods
00:36 - a static method
00:38 - is a method that can be called without
00:40 - creating an instance of a class
00:43 - static methods are designed to be shared
00:45 - by all objects created from the class
00:48 - they are often used to access static
00:50 - variables
00:51 - we assess a static method using the name
00:54 - of the class instead of the name of the
00:56 - object let's say we have a food truck
01:00 - class it has a static variable that
01:02 - keeps track of how many food trucks have
01:04 - been created
01:05 - we shouldn't need to create a food truck
01:07 - object to increase the number of food
01:10 - trucks
01:11 - we can add a static method to the food
01:13 - truck class to increase the number of
01:16 - food trucks by 1 when it's called
01:19 - when we write the method signature we
01:21 - add the keyword static in front of the
01:23 - return type
01:25 - in the body of the method we can
01:27 - increase our static variable num chucks
01:29 - by one to call this method we state the
01:32 - name of the class dot the name of the
01:34 - method
01:37 - static methods only have access to
01:39 - static variables and other static
01:42 - methods they cannot change or access the
01:44 - values of instance variables
01:47 - for example if our food truck class has
01:50 - an instant variable called name
01:54 - then a static method attempting to
01:56 - change the name will cause an error
01:58 - the static method does not have access
02:01 - to instance variables because instance
02:03 - variables belong to specific objects
02:07 - these methods are useful when we need to
02:10 - access static variables or perform
02:12 - attacks that do not require an object
