00:01 - Hour of Code | Dance Party: Properties
00:08 - My name is Maria.
00:10 - I'm a junior at the University of Washington
00:12 - and I'm an Amazon future engineer.
00:16 - I love computer science because
00:18 - it incorporates problem-solving and critical thinking.
00:21 - And after putting hours of work into something,
00:24 - you can get something really cool and rewarding out of it.
00:32 - So far, you've had a chance to play with some different types of dancers
00:37 - and you've programmed them to do different types of dance moves.
00:41 - But how do these moves really work?
00:44 - Every dance move is made up of a series of images called frames.
00:49 - Each frame is slightly different from the
one before it.
00:52 - When your program runs, the computer shows one frame after another.
00:56 - They're shown so fast that it looks like the
dancer is moving.
01:00 - This is the secret behind all animation.
01:03 - Not only can you change your dancer's moves,
01:06 - you can also change a dancer's properties.
01:09 - Properties describe things like the dancer's
position on the screen,
01:13 - the dancer's size,
01:15 - and the dancer's color.
01:20 - To change the properties of a dancer, you'll use a "set" block.
01:24 - Let's use a "set" block to make our dancers look smaller.
01:29 - First, drag the set block into your program.
01:32 - Then, select the dancer you'd like to change
01:35 - and type in the size that will appear on screen.
01:50 - Full size is 100.
01:52 - If you choose a lower number, that will make the dancer smaller.
01:57 - The smaller the dancer is, the further away it looks.
02:00 - This is a great way to make backup dancers.
02:10 - Using the set block, you can also change the dancer's dimensions,
02:15 - rotation,
02:17 - position
02:20 - and color.
02:22 - By playing around with these properties
02:23 - you can make all kinds of changes and link them to different parts of the song.
02:28 - Remember, you can only set the properties of a dancer that already exists.
02:34 - Make sure that your set block comes after the "Make a new dancer" block.
02:39 - Feel free to experiment, be creative,
02:41 - and have fun.
