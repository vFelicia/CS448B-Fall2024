00:03 - Stampy: Congratulations, you did it!
00:05 - Stacy: Congratulations guys, you totally rocked
that!
00:10 - And now that you've completed the Hour of
Code, you can start coding in Minecraft.
00:15 - You've learned about loops, functions, and
what a software Agent does.
00:20 - Now, it's time for the free play level, where
you are the developer.
00:23 - Use any remaining time to write your own functions
to explore, mine, and build.
00:28 - You can take the code that you write in this
level into your Minecraft world on Minecraft:
00:31 - Education Edition.
00:33 - Just click "Finish" and follow the instructions
for getting the link to use in your world
00:36 - to continue coding with the Agent.
00:38 - Have fun, and good job!
00:40 - Stacy: And I'm back!
00:43 - Okay, you guys, this is the Agent!
00:45 - Let me show you what it can do.
00:47 - Look, look!
00:49 - It's doing it!
00:51 - I told it to build a staircase out of these
terra cotta blocks, now we can just use this
00:55 - to get out of here.
00:56 - And you guys, it's not just staircases.
00:59 - I can tell the Agent to do anything I want,
and it will do it for me.
01:03 - Stampy: How did you do that?
01:05 - Stacy: It was easy, actually.
01:06 - I just used code!
