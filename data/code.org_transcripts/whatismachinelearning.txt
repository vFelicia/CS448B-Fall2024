00:08 - My name is Ali Flores and I'm a product
00:10 - manager at Alexa.
00:11 - My name is Dr. Chelsea Haupt, I work at
00:13 - the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence
00:15 - and I work on an AI-powered academic
00:17 - search engine.
00:21 - All around you computers are making
00:23 - decisions and those decisions affect
00:26 - your daily life.
00:27 - When you do an internet search, or scroll
00:30 - through your news feed
00:31 - computers decide what you see.
00:34 - Computers can already recognize your face
00:37 - and understand your voice.
00:38 - And soon they'll be driving cars,
00:40 - and detecting diseases even better than humans.
00:44 - So, how is any of this possible?
00:46 - You may have heard
00:48 - about something called AI,
00:50 - or artificial intelligence, true artificial intelligence is decades away
00:56 - there's a type of AI called
00:58 - machine learning that is here today.
01:00 - It's a type of AI you probably interact
01:02 - with every day
01:03 - without even knowing it.
01:05 - And it has the opportunity to help us
01:08 - tackle some of the world's biggest challenges.
01:12 - Machine learning is how computers
01:14 - recognize patterns,
01:16 - and make decisions without being
01:19 - explicitly programmed.
01:21 - What's so exciting is that it's a
01:23 - completely different way
01:25 - to program a computer than what we've
01:28 - ever done before.
01:31 - With machine learning, instead of
01:33 - programming a computer
01:34 - step-by-step, you can program a computer
01:37 - to learn
01:38 - just like you learn through trial and error,
01:41 - and lots of practice.
01:44 - Learning comes from experience,
01:45 - and that's true for machine learning too.
01:48 - In this case, experience means lots and lots of data.
01:54 - Machine learning can take in any kind of data:
01:57 - images, video, audio, or text
02:01 - and begin to recognize patterns in that data
02:06 - once it learns to recognize patterns in
02:08 - the data it can also learn to make
02:10 - predictions based on those patterns,
02:13 - like noticing the difference between an image of a car
02:16 - and an image of a bicycle.
02:20 - AI and machine learning are playing a
02:22 - bigger and bigger role
02:24 - in society at large
02:26 - and shaping all of our futures.
02:29 - That's why it's so important to learn
02:31 - how it works
02:32 - with some hands-on experience.
02:36 - Remember AI is like any tool.
02:39 - First you get the knowledge,
02:41 - then you get the power
