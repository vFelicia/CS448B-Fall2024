00:00 - Unplugged Activity | happy maps.
00:05 - This lesson
is called Happy Maps. Today we're gonna help
00:09 - our furry little friend Flurb get to her fruit.
Make your Flurb go to your fruit. To do this
00:18 - you'll need to figure out which way the Flurb
needs to go and direct her with arrows. In
00:22 - order for the Flurb to get to the apple, what
direction does the Flurb have to go? Line
00:28 - to make it go up. And to get it there you
circle the direction that it has to go. Create
00:35 - your algorithm by gluing arrows next to the
map that you're trying to solve. The second
00:41 - one it's the same but it's going down. It's
like programming with paper. And that's it!
