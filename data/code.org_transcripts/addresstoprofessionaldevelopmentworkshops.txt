00:30 - hi my name is hadi partovi and i'm the
00:32 - founder and ceo of code.org and the
00:34 - creator of the international hour of
00:35 - code movement
00:37 - i want to welcome all of you who are
00:39 - participating in our professional
00:40 - learning we are so proud of the tens of
00:43 - thousands of educators like yourselves
00:45 - who have joined the global movement to
00:47 - bring computer science to be part of
00:48 - school curricula worldwide
00:50 - at code.org we believe that our
00:52 - professional learning experiences
00:54 - empower educators to advance a mission
00:57 - of equity our vision is that every
00:59 - student in every school should have the
01:01 - opportunity to learn computer science as
01:03 - part of their core k-12 education
01:06 - we also believe that access to
01:07 - high-quality computer science education
01:10 - is an important equity issue why because
01:13 - computer science is not just about
01:14 - coding it involves critical thinking
01:17 - problem solving creativity and
01:19 - collaboration
01:20 - all skills that are vital to education
01:22 - and careers in and out of the tech field
01:25 - students also consistently report that
01:27 - computer science is one of the subjects
01:29 - they most enjoy
01:31 - however high quality computer science
01:33 - education still isn't available to all
01:35 - students and the discrepancies in access
01:38 - often follow along lines of race gender
01:41 - or income level educators like
01:43 - yourselves play a vital role in
01:45 - supporting equity in computer science
01:47 - and we at code.org have invested in
01:49 - building equity focused computer science
01:51 - curricular and professional learning
01:53 - experiences to support you all in this
01:55 - work
01:56 - thank you for being part of this
01:57 - movement

02:03 - as you undertake this journey i know
02:05 - that you may be a little bit scared you
02:07 - may be feeling a sense of intimidation
02:08 - about teaching a potentially new subject
02:11 - area and my advice to you is to embrace
02:13 - that intimidation and to recognize that
02:16 - there are tens of thousands of teachers
02:17 - like yourselves doing the same thing
02:20 - we believe that the best way to handle
02:21 - this intimidation is to be upfront with
02:23 - your own students about it and let them
02:26 - know that you're modeling how to be a
02:27 - lifelong learner
02:29 - because by the time they're your age
02:30 - they'll also need to continue learning
02:32 - as they go and try to keep up with new
02:34 - technology
02:36 - the change that's happening in america's
02:37 - classrooms and the embracing of computer
02:40 - science in the curriculum wouldn't be
02:42 - possible without the sacrifices of so
02:44 - many educators like yourselves
02:46 - deciding to go through workshops to
02:48 - learn something new overcome that
02:50 - intimidation and recognize that this is
02:52 - important for your students
02:55 - finally we understand that educators
02:57 - like yourselves come to our professional
02:59 - learning experiences for a wide range of
03:01 - reasons we understand that you're likely
03:03 - expecting to spend some of your time
03:04 - with us
03:05 - diving into the curriculum and learning
03:07 - everything you need to know about
03:08 - computer science this experience will
03:11 - absolutely support you in learning about
03:13 - computer science and this curriculum and
03:15 - we'll present it in a way that allows us
03:17 - to keep equity at the forefront of our
03:19 - thoughts and activity
03:20 - because at the end of the day we all
03:22 - play a critical role in making equitable
03:25 - computer science education a reality for
03:27 - our students and we're excited to work
03:29 - with you to consider the opportunities
03:31 - we have to do so
03:33 - thank you
