00:00 - Now we're going to learn about if statements.
If statements are a fundamental part of learning
00:05 - to program. They help a computer make decisions.
All computers use if statements, including
00:12 - my phone. For example, when I unlock my phone,
it runs some code that says if I enter the
00:19 - password correctly, then unlock the phone.
Otherwise, it shows an error message.
00:26 - You can use if statements in your code to make
Steve and Alice react to what they see in
00:30 - the world. For example, if there is a rock
in front of them, they can turn left. Or turn
00:38 - right if they run into a tree. In this case,
we don't want to fall in the lava.
00:45 - It's easy to plan for the lava. We can see it on
the screen. But what about the lava that we
00:50 - can't under the stone?
After we mine the stone, we'll need to check
00:55 - if there's any lava in that place before moving
forward. If there is lava there, we want to
01:02 - place a stone in front of our character before
we move forward. That way we can safely move on.
01:08 - Time for more mining! And remember to
use the if statement to watch your step.
