00:04 - the work for Latin America where are the
00:07 - people from Latin America by the way
00:09 - Make Some
00:10 - Noise thank you so much uh this
00:12 - afternoon we are going to celebrate new
00:15 - product releases and organizations that
00:18 - are advancing computer science around
00:20 - the
00:22 - world please join me in welcoming
00:25 - welcoming sorry Sam shorts senior
00:27 - product manager at c.org to preview some
00:29 - exciting NE
00:36 - products hi
00:41 - every
00:43 - hi hi
00:45 - hi hi everybody I'm Sam Schwarz and I'm
00:49 - a product manager at code.org my team is
00:52 - responsible for ensuring that we have
00:53 - excellent free courses and tools for
00:55 - students all over the world and as the
00:57 - world thank you and as the world is
01:00 - being transformed by AI we want to make
01:03 - sure that we are properly preparing
01:05 - students for that new world today I'm
01:07 - going to share some exciting recent
01:08 - developments code.org has made to our
01:11 - products to advance this Mission
01:13 - code.org has deeply invested in AI
01:16 - taking a holistic cross organizational
01:18 - approach in addition to the T initiative
01:20 - which I know you all have heard a lot
01:22 - about we've been building curriculum and
01:24 - platform services that teach and
01:25 - leverage AI for our curriculum we aim to
01:29 - provide IND indry leading AI education
01:31 - for both primary and secondary schools
01:33 - on how AI Works how to leverage Ai and
01:37 - the ethical and societal impacts of AI
01:39 - and I am honored to be here today to
01:41 - share some of my colleagues work and
01:43 - what they've done to provide fun and
01:44 - engaging AI curiculum over the past
01:46 - several
01:47 - months as many of you may have seen this
01:50 - summer we launched an AI 101 teachers
01:53 - learning series with several sessions to
01:55 - help teachers understand Ai and how to
01:57 - bring it into their classrooms
01:59 - throughout these five sessions we've
02:00 - reached over 20,000 teachers across the
02:03 - globe this fall we launched a post AP
02:07 - Computer Science application module that
02:09 - offers high school students hands-on
02:11 - experience with professional software
02:13 - development tools including GitHub and
02:15 - GitHub co-pilot to teach Real World
02:18 - skills in computer vision and working
02:20 - directly with AI assisted code
02:22 - throughout this module students are
02:24 - getting hands-on experience with the
02:26 - same AI tools that the and processes
02:29 - that industry Engineers are
02:31 - using we also launched our how AI work
02:34 - series to provide classrooms with a set
02:36 - of videos and accommodating in-classroom
02:39 - lessons on how AI works these videos
02:41 - range from neural networks to generative
02:44 - images to algorithmic bias and the range
02:46 - of lessons give teachers a flexible
02:48 - approach to how they introduce AI to
02:50 - their students and this year we are
02:53 - going to be introducing these lessons in
02:54 - 12 different languages coming
02:57 - soon finally we were really excited for
03:00 - those of you who attended this morning
03:02 - to demo our pilot modules this morning
03:05 - as part of computer science connections
03:07 - which integrates computer science into
03:09 - other core subjects our English language
03:11 - arts module gives English teachers a way
03:14 - to introduce generative AI into their
03:16 - classrooms students interact with
03:18 - different chatbot personas to help in
03:20 - different parts of the writing process
03:22 - such as drafting or revising or copy
03:24 - editing in our history module we bring
03:27 - AI to students and teach them how to
03:29 - compare traditional research methods
03:32 - with researching using AI both of these
03:35 - modules are not chatbot specific but
03:37 - instead we built to be customized by
03:39 - teachers for their classrooms and their
03:41 - standards and their goals code.org is
03:44 - leading the way and introducing AI to
03:47 - every student in every
03:49 - subject for our platforms and services
03:52 - we aim to carefully leverage AI to close
03:55 - learning gaps at scale helping teachers
03:57 - to be more effective in the classroom
03:59 - and giving students powerful new tools
04:01 - for learning computer science this year
04:04 - for hour of code we're excited to
04:06 - introduce students to the power of
04:08 - creativity with AI today I'm going to
04:11 - give you all a sneak peek of how we are
04:12 - integrating AI into code.org dance party
04:15 - students will learn the basics of
04:17 - computer science by creative creating
04:19 - these cute interactive dancers but we'll
04:21 - also work with AI to create their
04:23 - perfect dance party effect right now you
04:27 - this group is going to get the first
04:28 - ever look at our new dance party AI
04:31 - Edition extremely hot off the presses
04:33 - Last Night Roll the
04:36 - tape students will be able to prompt the
04:38 - AI with their favorite
04:41 - emoji and while they're picking their
04:43 - emojis which I've been in a few
04:45 - classroom tests and this is like the
04:47 - most fun thing that they've ever done in
04:48 - their whole life um everyone's asking
04:51 - for more emojis they'll prompt the AI
04:53 - with their emojis and then they will be
04:55 - able to generate new backgrounds AI will
04:58 - watch or students will watch watch ai go
05:00 - through the
05:01 - decisionmaking process of evaluating
05:03 - which effects most closely associate
05:05 - with the emojis that they
05:09 - picked it's going through finding the
05:12 - best ones oh it didn't play the whole
05:15 - thing oh there you go once it's
05:18 - generated students will be able to view
05:19 - the code that AI generated as well as
05:23 - see a deeper view into why the AI picked
05:27 - what it picked based on the different
05:28 - emojis
05:30 - and then they'll be able to use the
05:32 - effect and use it in their dance party
05:35 - how fun
05:38 - yay we are super excited to bring this
05:41 - to classrooms all across the world
05:44 - because we will also be translating this
05:46 - tutorial into 12 different
05:50 - languages every year one of our top pain
05:52 - points we hear from teachers is that
05:54 - it's very difficult to assess student
05:56 - learning and again for the first time I
05:59 - am super thrilled to give you all a look
06:01 - into our brand new AI teaching
06:06 - assistant integrated directly into our
06:08 - code.org platform our AI teaching
06:11 - assistant will provide initial
06:12 - assessments of student work providing a
06:15 - starting point for teachers AI teaching
06:17 - assistant will decrease the time spent
06:19 - for repetitive assessments oh is it not
06:27 - playing oh wait a second
06:34 - it's very cool I
06:42 - promise and I'll keep going with my
06:44 - Spiel AI teaching assistant will
06:46 - decrease the time spent on repetitive
06:48 - assessments and allow teachers to focus
06:50 - on personalized feedbacks for students
06:52 - that need it the most just this month we
06:55 - released this pilot that eventually
06:58 - you'll see in a second um across the
07:00 - country and we're super excited to learn
07:02 - how this is going to impact both
07:05 - students and teachers in the
07:12 - classroom Casey can we play the video
07:15 - technical error uh it's not playing
07:17 - right now so we'll try to go back to it
07:20 - in a second Sam sorry okay that's okay
07:23 - it's
07:26 - [Music]
07:27 - frozen has everyone been having fun at
07:29 - CS
07:33 - edcon I
07:37 - have all right let's see awesome yay so
07:41 - this is our AI teacher assistant
07:43 - integrated directly into our platform
07:45 - it's evaluating the student work and
07:47 - giving teachers recommendations and
07:49 - confidence score of how confident the AI
07:51 - is on the recommendation but the AI
07:54 - isn't giving any student grades without
07:56 - teachers going in checking
07:58 - double-checking what the AI has done um
08:00 - but we hope that this makes life easier
08:03 - for teachers when they're just doing
08:04 - like very repetitive tasks and make sure
08:06 - they can really focus on the places
08:08 - where they need to give personalized
08:09 - feedback to
08:11 - students awesome thank
08:15 - you
08:17 - yay lastly imagine a world where every
08:21 - student has an OnDemand judgement-free
08:23 - personal guide for their computer
08:25 - science courses um well I'm excited to
08:27 - announce that we are working on an AI
08:29 - tutor we believe that this will increase
08:31 - the sense of belonging and confidence
08:33 - among students and offer personalized
08:35 - learning support regardless of student
08:37 - need thinking back to my own experience
08:39 - being one of the only women in my
08:41 - intruded computer science course it was
08:43 - super intimidating to ask questions that
08:45 - I thought would make me look stupid in
08:47 - front of my peers but an AI tutor would
08:50 - have been the perfect way to make me
08:51 - feel confident in my computer science
08:53 - skills both inside and outside of the
08:55 - classroom we are currently in
08:56 - development so I don't have a fun video
08:58 - unfortunately but we hope to have a
09:00 - pilot by Spring 2024 so hopefully have
09:03 - something to show you next year's CS
09:09 - edcon thank you so much for your time
09:11 - and I look forward to seeing what we can
09:13 - create to increase the success of
09:15 - computer science learning for
09:28 - everyone
09:32 - hello
09:34 - again Amazon has been a crucial partner
09:37 - for us at go.org they sponsored our
09:40 - initial dance party and now the one that
09:43 - Sam just shared with you all we are glad
09:46 - to welcome haa Barbo and pedo mayard
09:49 - Jang to preview some of the new programs
09:52 - coming from the Amazon future engineer
09:54 - welcome hila and
09:58 - pedo
10:04 - hello oh it works
10:06 - awesome yeah good hi everyone I'm hila
10:10 - like
10:11 - hila uh and I yes I have to do that uh I
10:15 - come to this work as a former middle
10:17 - school science and computer science
10:19 - teacher I'm now a senior product manager
10:21 - at Amazon future
10:23 - engineer and I'm padrio a child of
10:25 - Jamaican immigrants I discovered
10:27 - computers in my nth grade Math Science
10:30 - History classroom where I taught myself
10:32 - basic fell in love with computers and
10:35 - eventually became a CS professor and AI
10:37 - software development engineer at Amazon
10:39 - now I lead research for Amazon future
10:42 - engineer so we want to start with a
10:44 - flash back to 2013 in New Orleans
10:48 - Louisiana who that anybody no okay maybe
10:52 - few yes right there let's go Louisiana
10:54 - uh this is a picture of my class as we
10:57 - completed the very first hour of code
11:01 - and my students absolutely loved it
11:05 - thank you code.org uh afterwards my
11:08 - students all wanted to connect with
11:10 - someone who worked in technology they
11:12 - wanted to figure out how they could
11:13 - follow in their footsteps the problem
11:16 - was that none of us in my class myself
11:19 - included actually knew anyone who worked
11:22 - in Tech or in software I was unable to
11:25 - make that role model connection for them
11:29 - and my students were not alone in this
11:31 - struggle as many teachers in this room
11:34 - know in fact 36% of students base their
11:38 - career aspirations off people they know
11:41 - only 1% base their career aspirations
11:44 - off someone visiting their school for
11:47 - students in underserved and
11:48 - underrepresented communities like my
11:50 - students this is grim news it appears
11:54 - that at times pursuing a career is more
11:57 - about who you know than what you know or
12:00 - what you're interested
12:02 - in at Amazon future engineer we aim to
12:05 - change this our team's goal is to
12:07 - leverage Amazon's assets people business
12:10 - technology to prepare all students
12:13 - especially those from underserved and
12:14 - under represented backgrounds to pursue
12:16 - the careers of the future we do this by
12:19 - funding computer science science
12:21 - education initiatives and by providing
12:23 - scholarships and internships in
12:25 - engineering at Amazon and in the past
12:28 - year with we been doubling down on a new
12:30 - Focus Area Career exploration and role
12:33 - model
12:34 - access so how have we been approaching
12:37 - career exploration so far well we are
12:40 - very much in the beginnings of this so
12:43 - please know that uh and one of the first
12:45 - things we decided to do was look for
12:47 - opportunities to directly connect
12:48 - students to someone who works at Amazon
12:51 - through externships career days and
12:54 - virtual class career talks to date over
12:57 - 200,000 students have directly connected
13:00 - to an Amazon professional through these
13:02 - free
13:03 - programs second due to teacher requests
13:06 - we've also started to build out a free
13:08 - virtual interactive field trip program
13:10 - that takes students behind the scenes at
13:12 - Amazon to explore the technology and the
13:15 - careers of the future students can
13:17 - Journey inside an AWS data center follow
13:20 - Alexa into space tour one of our
13:22 - robotics facilities and while they're
13:24 - there they get to learn about the
13:26 - careers that help make that technology
13:29 - possible over 750,000 students have
13:32 - completed a career tour with 86%
13:34 - reporting interest in the future careers
13:37 - after the
13:38 - tour as we listened to students and
13:40 - Educators and started piloting these
13:42 - programs a research question quickly
13:44 - emerged what career should we be
13:46 - featuring only software development
13:49 - Engineers or should we show the art side
13:52 - HR recruiters the management side what
13:56 - about technicians or equipment
13:58 - installers
13:59 - who may not have bachelor's degrees to
14:02 - answer this question we embarked on a
14:03 - research project and we're excited to
14:05 - share um to share a few of our findings
14:09 - from that with you we partnered with
14:12 - Gallup to create a careers of the future
14:14 - index we looked at the 529 different job
14:18 - description categories used by Census
14:20 - Bureau and developed a way to rank these
14:22 - jobs according to categories uh which
14:25 - will matter most in the future one
14:27 - salary two job growth three job demand
14:31 - and four resistance to
14:33 - automation we gave each of the 529 jobs
14:36 - a score according to these criteria and
14:38 - weighted them according to what we
14:39 - believe matter most based on student and
14:42 - educator discussions and the literature
14:45 - this is open data so you can access and
14:47 - wait differently yourselves as
14:49 - well so drum roll the top 20 careers of
14:54 - the future that only require a
14:57 - bachelor's degree
14:59 - woo there they are okay do a quick scan
15:04 - and you'll notice a trend here 12 of the
15:09 - top 20 are in
15:12 - engineering wow Amazon future engineer I
15:14 - get it cool awesome fascinating also
15:19 - probably not surprising to anyone in
15:20 - this room and if we expand that to stem
15:24 - skills more broadly we see that it's
15:26 - actually more like 18 of the top 20 if
15:29 - you're in here and you're in PR
15:31 - marketing for fund reason you squeaked
15:33 - on by great
15:35 - work and if we look at jobs that don't
15:37 - require a bachelor's degree uh we see
15:40 - the same Trend over half of the top 20
15:42 - jobs of the future not requiring a
15:45 - college degree are in stem or stem
15:48 - trades for Amazon this reinforces our
15:51 - belief that computer science and stem
15:53 - literacy are essential ingredients to
15:56 - Preparing students for the careers of
15:58 - the future
16:00 - our research report dives into many
16:02 - other questions regarding these careers
16:04 - in the interest of time I'll quickly
16:06 - highlight two that we believe are
16:08 - important to our Collective work
16:09 - together first how do these care careers
16:12 - align to students career
16:14 - plans the answer is they don't in 2018
16:18 - Pisa asked 15-year-olds what careers
16:21 - they expect to pursue the most e
16:23 - economically viable careers are less
16:26 - popular Among Us teens computers and
16:28 - math architecture and engineering are
16:30 - some of the most viable with a CFI score
16:32 - of 90 plus but rank among the least
16:35 - mentioned among among students today
16:38 - students who rank entertainment and
16:40 - media so highly often do not even know
16:43 - they can work in these careers while in
16:45 - technology for example the tech jobs
16:47 - enabling Thursday night NFL on
16:52 - Prime our our research also looked at
16:56 - how representation by gender and race
16:58 - shows up across these careers here's
17:01 - just one tidbit for you the career with
17:04 - the largest gap in representation by
17:06 - race and also with a large gap in gender
17:09 - is software
17:12 - developer collectively we have a lot to
17:14 - do in this space to make access to
17:16 - computer science related careers more
17:20 - Equitable so now we have another
17:22 - question but this question is for you
17:23 - all what should we industry schools
17:27 - curriculum writers profits what should
17:29 - we do this with this data how should it
17:32 - impact the products we build the
17:34 - programs we run the policies we pass at
17:37 - Amazon future engineer we believe that
17:39 - new thought leadership is needed in this
17:42 - space from all our Collective
17:44 - organizations in order to unlock the
17:46 - careers of the future for all students
17:49 - and we are really excited to announce uh
17:52 - that a new partnership with the computer
17:54 - science teacher Association uh
17:56 - specifically dedicated to thinking about
17:58 - this question of career exploration but
18:01 - we challenge everyone in this room to
18:03 - please join us in this Quest if our
18:06 - Collective goal all of us is to change
18:09 - who has access to those CS jobs then we
18:12 - have to provide both the education to
18:14 - build the skills and the opportunities
18:17 - for career exploration and role model
18:19 - access thank you so much for joining us
18:21 - today uh the research we mentioned you
18:23 - can download at Amazon futur
18:25 - engineer.com resesarch
18:29 - uh you can also take a look at our newly
18:31 - published research around the impact of
18:33 - Role Models uh so we look forward to
18:35 - working with you all on this big problem
18:37 - and please don't be a stranger thank you
18:39 - so
18:41 - much
