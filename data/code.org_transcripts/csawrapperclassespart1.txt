00:10 - hi my name is minja and i'm a software
00:13 - engineer at airbnb growing up i always
00:16 - like
00:17 - picked up on various topics from just
00:19 - googling them so technology helped me
00:21 - there and now it's kind of cool that i
00:23 - get to be the software engineer that
00:26 - makes technology more useful for other
00:28 - people too
00:31 - in java we store numbers using primitive
00:34 - data types like int double and boolean
00:39 - primitive data types use very little
00:41 - memory so we can process information in
00:44 - our programs quickly
00:46 - primitive data types are limited and
00:49 - don't have any special attributes or
00:51 - behaviors
00:53 - on the other hand classes give us access
00:56 - to special attributes and behaviors
00:59 - so let's find out how we can represent
01:01 - primitive data types as classes
01:05 - wrapper classes are classes that are
01:08 - used to make objects for each of java's
01:10 - primitive data types
01:12 - every primitive data type in java has a
01:15 - wrapper class associated with it
01:19 - these are the primitive types in java we
01:21 - have learned about so far and their
01:23 - corresponding wrapper classes
01:26 - the wrapper class for int is integer
01:29 - with a capital i
01:32 - the wrapper class for double is double
01:34 - with a capital d
01:36 - the wrapper class for boolean is boolean
01:39 - with a capital b
01:41 - [Music]
01:42 - so how do we use these to create objects
01:47 - first let's make a variable of type int
01:51 - we have two ways to use a wrapper class
01:53 - to make this variable
01:54 - one way is to declare a variable of the
01:57 - wrapper class type integer
01:59 - the other way is to use the new keyword
02:01 - and the integer constructor which takes
02:04 - it into value as a parameter
02:07 - the integer wrapper class has an
02:09 - instance variable of type int
02:11 - that is initialized when we use the
02:13 - constructor to create an integer object
02:16 - the same is true for the double class
02:20 - we can declare a variable of the wrapper
02:22 - class type double
02:24 - or we can use the double class
02:26 - constructor
02:29 - this uses the new keyword and double
02:31 - constructor which takes a double value
02:34 - as a parameter
