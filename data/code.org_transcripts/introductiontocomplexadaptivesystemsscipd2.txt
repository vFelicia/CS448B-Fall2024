00:06 - hi everybody I'm John P Gonzalez a
00:07 - facilitator with project guts in Santa
00:09 - Fe New Mexico in this video you'll learn
00:12 - about complex adaptive systems a type of
00:14 - scientific phenomena that will be
00:15 - modeling and investigating through the
00:17 - code.org mscs and science
00:22 - [Music]
00:27 - modules have you ever wondered how
00:29 - thousands of Birds move in amazing
00:31 - patterns like
00:33 - this ever watched fish schooling and
00:35 - wondered how they coordinate their
00:37 - movements when you're looking at a flock
00:39 - of birds or a school of fish you're
00:41 - watching the behavior of a system of
00:43 - many interacting parts in this case
00:45 - individual birds or individual fish are
00:48 - the parts systems where unexpected
00:51 - patterns emerge as a result of many
00:53 - individual Parts interacting are called
00:55 - complex systems the study of complex
00:58 - systems has recently recognized as a new
01:01 - type of science the living world is a
01:04 - great place to find examples of complex
01:06 - systems where the actions of individuals
01:08 - turn into the behaviors of a
01:13 - group this bird flock is an example of a
01:16 - complex system in
01:18 - action to understand how any complex
01:21 - system works it's important to answer
01:23 - two basic questions how do each of the
01:26 - parts of the system behave for example
01:28 - how does each Bird In A Flock behave
01:30 - and how do the parts act together to
01:32 - form the behavior of the whole system
01:35 - for example how do individual birds in a
01:37 - flock act together to form beautiful
01:39 - flying patterns let's look at the first
01:42 - question how does each bird in the flock
01:45 - behave believe it or not every bird in
01:47 - the flock is following the same three
01:49 - Simple
01:51 - Rules stay close to but don't bump into
01:54 - the birds around me fly as fast as the
01:57 - birds near me and move towards the
01:59 - center of the
02:01 - group now for the second question how do
02:04 - the individual birds in a flock act
02:06 - together to form these beautiful flying
02:09 - patterns you might think there is one
02:12 - leader bird who is somehow sending
02:14 - messages to tell other birds in the
02:15 - flock where to fly but really it's much
02:18 - less complicated than that when hundreds
02:20 - or thousands of birds each follow the
02:22 - same three rules amazing flocking
02:25 - patterns
02:26 - emerge sometimes even if you can figure
02:28 - out how each individual ual in a complex
02:30 - system behaves it's really hard to
02:33 - predict how a system as a whole will
02:35 - behave or what types of patterns will
02:37 - emerge when many individuals are all
02:39 - acting at the same time this is where
02:42 - the power of computer simulations comes
02:44 - in agent-based computer models and
02:47 - simulations are great tools to visualize
02:49 - and explore group behaviors for example
02:53 - in this simulation of fish interacting
02:55 - with algae in a pond every yellow fish
02:57 - you see is programmed to follow the same
02:59 - simple rules for movement getting energy
03:02 - by eating algae reproduction and death
03:05 - the algae is also programmed to follow
03:08 - simple rules for reproduction and death
03:11 - once the behavior of these two types of
03:12 - individuals and the interactions between
03:14 - them has been programmed the simulation
03:17 - can then populate a virtual world with
03:19 - tens hundreds or even thousands of fish
03:21 - in algae all following their assign
03:23 - rules at the same time using computer
03:26 - models like this helps people observe
03:27 - what happens at the level of the system
03:29 - or in this case the simulated ecosystem
03:33 - other than the fact that they're really
03:34 - cool why is understanding complex
03:36 - systems important biologists physicists
03:39 - Engineers mathematicians and social
03:41 - scientists are finding that the rules
03:43 - that create ordered systems from
03:44 - Individual behaviors are showing up in
03:47 - many fields and at many different scales
03:49 - complex systems arise from the behavior
03:51 - of molecules in our bodies of bird
03:53 - flocks or even from human interactions
03:56 - like crowds and traffic jams they're
03:58 - also finding that understanding the way
04:00 - individual Parts work together may be
04:02 - just as important as understanding the
04:03 - way that they work alone
