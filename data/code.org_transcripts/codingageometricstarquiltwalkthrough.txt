00:03 - welcome to computer science connections
00:05 - coding a geometric star quilt this
00:08 - module makes connections between math
00:10 - and computer science specifically it can
00:13 - introduce reinforce or extend any
00:16 - student learning related to Geometry if
00:19 - you're teaching about geometric shapes
00:22 - native American traditions or just want
00:24 - to get your students coding you've come
00:26 - to the right
00:28 - place
00:31 - in this module students will use
00:33 - geometry and measurement skills to code
00:36 - a star quilt the main computer science
00:39 - Concepts in this module are Loops one
00:41 - powerful concept coders use often is
00:44 - called a loop because it allows you to
00:46 - execute something over and over again
00:49 - with just a few
00:51 - keystrokes Whenever there is a chunk of
00:54 - code that is used over and over again
00:57 - you can take that chunk of code put it
00:59 - in a repeat block and specify how many
01:02 - times you want that code to Loop Loops
01:05 - allow coders to create more efficient
01:08 - code with less room for
01:12 - bugs there are three lessons in this
01:15 - module the first lesson is in plugged
01:17 - students will learn about Native
01:19 - American Star Quilts and their
01:21 - significance make a six-pointed star
01:23 - shape on paper and discuss the patterns
01:26 - within the
01:28 - shape
01:32 - in lesson two students will use the
01:34 - artist tool to build important coding
01:37 - skills students will create a simple
01:39 - star shape by learning how the stamping
01:42 - tool Works how to turn X degrees in an
01:46 - angle and how to use Loops they will
01:48 - manipulate angle measurements to change
01:51 - the number of points the star
01:55 - [Music]
01:58 - has
02:01 - in lesson three students build their own
02:03 - star quilt by starting with one point of
02:06 - a star then they Loop their code to end
02:10 - up with a traditional eighto star quilt
02:13 - when they finish they can share their
02:16 - work with
02:21 - others students May struggle with
02:23 - turning the artist the correct number of
02:25 - degrees remind students that the way the
02:28 - artist faces may impact the number of
02:31 - degrees it will need to turn or guide
02:34 - students to practice turning as the
02:35 - artist in real
02:40 - life in every lesson plan discussion
02:43 - questions are coupled with discussion
02:45 - goals check for understanding and
02:47 - promote student Reflection by
02:49 - incorporating these discussion questions
02:51 - into your teaching highlight the
02:54 - following relationships for students if
02:57 - the artist turns less degrees then the
02:59 - artist artist will create more points in
03:01 - a star if the artist turns more degrees
03:05 - then the artist will create fewer points
03:07 - in the
03:11 - star this module is aligned with common
03:13 - core math and the computer science
03:15 - Teachers Association standards in order
03:18 - to align to Concepts you already teach
03:21 - to help you think of ways to integrate
03:23 - ask yourself how might this module
03:25 - support the content I am already
03:27 - teaching and should I use this module to
03:30 - introduce reinforce or extend student
03:33 - learning on this
03:37 - topic review the vocabulary concepts
03:40 - with your students use the provided
03:42 - slideshow to introduce these Concepts
03:44 - and teach the vocabulary within the
03:46 - context of the
03:50 - lesson there are many different colored
03:52 - rhombuses for students to choose from
03:55 - encourage creativity and
03:58 - personalization
04:02 - adding new comments may be a New Concept
04:05 - for students explain to students that
04:08 - code comments are a block that does
04:11 - nothing in the code but its purpose is
04:14 - to communicate information to the user
04:17 - don't forget about the hide and show
04:18 - feature for each lesson it's best
04:20 - practice to only show the lesson
04:22 - students are currently working on if you
04:24 - do not hide the following lessons
04:26 - students will be moved to the next
04:28 - lesson automatically
04:33 - before teaching the module complete each
04:36 - coding level on your own you can write
04:38 - your own code as an example for students
04:41 - make sure to review the lesson plans and
04:44 - additional resources code.org provides
04:47 - resources like slides student handouts
04:49 - and helpful hints to help you and your
04:52 - students get
04:58 - started
