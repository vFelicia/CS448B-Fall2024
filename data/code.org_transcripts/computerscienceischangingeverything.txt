00:02 - Computer Science is Changing Everything
00:08 - I think the 19th century was about the Industrial
00:12 - Revolution, about electricity, about disrupting
the agricultural society and making it more advanced.
00:19 - The 20th century was about physics
and engineering to do more things easier in
00:24 - our everyday life from refrigerators to washing
machines.
00:30 - And the 21st century is definitely the digital age. It's the Internet.
00:41 - Even if you want to become a race car driver
or play
00:45 - baseball or build a house, all of these things
have been turned upside down by software.
00:53 - AGRICULTURE
00:55 - The lettucebot is a robot that can
sense its environment.
01:00 - Every single hour this lettucebot is seeing 1.5 million
plants, and it's taking individual action
01:07 - on those plants.
01:08 - We enable lettuce growers
to have higher yields in their field by helping
01:12 - make it cheaper, by helping produce food in
a more sustainable way, and that wasn't previously
01:18 - possible without computer science and technology.
01:21 - FASHION
01:23 - I have a really fun job where we build Polyvore,
01:26 - which kind of combines all my favorite things,
so programming, as well
01:31 - as fashion, art, design, and shopping!
01:34 - Half
the products you use these days are software
01:37 - products that you play with on your phone
and so if you want to build something cool
01:42 - you need to know programming.
01:43 - There's so many
things you can do with computer science so
01:46 - if you just work backwards from the cool thing
you want to build and you figure out what
01:50 - that is, a lot of times computer programming
is part of that.
01:55 - So you should learn this skill.
01:58 - MEDICINE
02:00 - It's really exciting right
now, the technology that we're developing
02:03 - right now is going to be used by your doctor
in the next decade.
02:08 - When you come into the
02:09 - office and you're sick, the doctor is going
to ask you to spit in this cup.
02:15 - I will put
02:16 - it into this magic machine which is a sequencer
and in an hour I can tell you what you have
02:22 - or what's wrong with you.
02:23 - So if we're looking
for a new virus, for example, we'll download
02:27 - a database of all the viruses that are known.
02:31 - We'll search for our sequence of interest
02:34 - against a whole database of all viruses.
02:37 - So
you still need somebody to analyze the data;
02:39 - the computer is not smart enough yet.
02:44 - ENERGY
02:45 - Our software helps people save energy
02:47 - and thereby reduce their carbon emissions.
02:49 - To date, we've saved over 8 terawatt hours,
02:52 - which is the equivalent of about 1.1 million
cars on the road.
02:57 - When you're forecasting
02:58 - the wind there are so many different parameters
that go into it, it would be impossible for
03:02 - a human to sit down and do all those calculations.
03:05 - We need a computer model in order to forecast
it.
03:09 - PUBLIC SAFETY
03:13 - I write software which scans images--looking
for bad images, images that we know are illegal.
03:20 - I work very closely with organizations like
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
03:25 - I know that the work that we've done has impacted
the life of people, and I feel very strongly
03:32 - about it because there are a lot of social
problems right now that could really leverage
03:36 - the use of technology.
03:38 - It's a lot about empowering the people who
are there helping the world by giving them
03:43 - the tools to be able to do better.
03:45 - That's something that we can do right now
and the tools available are huge.
03:49 - ART AND ENTERTAINMENT
03:51 - The merging of art and technology
03:52 - is getting more and more significant now.
03:56 - Because computers and software are such an
03:58 - integral part of our lives day to day, people
are realizing that it can be quite creative
04:02 - to take this medium of computers and create
incredible works of art.
04:08 - In Finding Nemo,
04:10 - when Crush and Squirt and all their friends
are flying through the East Australian Current,
04:14 - you're seeing images of water flowing by,
you're seeing the colors on the back of the
04:20 - turtle, you're seeing the sides of the fish,
all of those things are generated through
04:24 - math and computer programs that we write that
we then give to the artist and they take that
04:29 - to create that final image and to tweak it
and make it look beautiful and look fun.
04:35 - The crux of it is really about invention.
04:38 - It's
about looking at the world and being dissatisfied
04:40 - with things and questioning everything.
04:42 - I
always felt like if I didn't learn how to
04:44 - program it would be like not learning how
to read.
04:48 - The future would just be closed to me.
04:51 - If you're in the coding profession, there's
so many things that you can do and you can
04:56 - pretty much pick and choose the course you
want to be in.
04:59 - Think that you can start something
05:01 - in your college dorm room and you can have
a set of people who haven't built a big company
05:06 - before come together and build something that
a billion people use as part of their daily
05:11 - lives is just crazy to think about.
05:13 - It's really
humbling and amazing.
05:15 - Really it's about the
05:16 - chance to reinvent things and see it out
there in the world and see people using it
05:20 - and having fun or having a better life because
of something that wasn't there before that
05:24 - you put in the world.
05:27 - Learn computer science.
It's changing everything.
