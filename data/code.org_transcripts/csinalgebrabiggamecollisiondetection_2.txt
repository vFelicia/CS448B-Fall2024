00:06 - all the sprites in your big game are now
00:09 - animated but nothing happens when they
00:11 - run into each other we're going to use
00:14 - collision detection to find out when
00:16 - sprites have touched each other so that
00:18 - we can later apply rules like increasing
00:20 - or decreasing your score when sprites
00:22 - collide using the provided line length
00:25 - function you will complete a function
00:28 - distance that uses the distance formula
00:30 - to calculate the distance between the
00:32 - center points of two sprites next you'll
00:36 - update the collide function to use the
00:38 - distance function if the distance
00:41 - between two sprites is less than 100
00:43 - pixels the sprites are close enough to
00:45 - be touching and the collide function
00:47 - should return true if everything works
00:50 - you'll see that when the player collides
00:52 - with a target your score increases and
00:55 - when the player collides with a danger
00:57 - your score decreases
