00:01 - about 12 years ago I was looking for a
00:04 - job and I was looking at what I thought
00:06 - mattered in the world and what I really
00:08 - think matters in the world in so many
00:10 - ways is our ability to communicate when
00:12 - you build technology you can build
00:14 - something and put it out there and so
00:16 - many people around the world can use it
00:17 - and use it at the same time and that
00:20 - makes our world a little bit smaller in
00:22 - a way that I think no other Industries
00:24 - managed to do I think for a long time
00:27 - the world thought that some things were
00:28 - for boys and some things were for girls
00:31 - and everyone understands now that boys
00:33 - and girls can have equal opportunities
00:35 - when girls are given equal opportunity
00:38 - to study computer science they're just
00:40 - as good at coding at Building Products
00:43 - as boys are I did not learn to code when
00:46 - I was in school because I didn't have
00:47 - this opportunity really no one did which
00:50 - is why I'm so excited that all of you
00:51 - are participating in hour of code and
00:53 - getting exposure to computer
00:56 - [Applause]
00:58 - science
