00:02 - computer science education week and the
00:03 - hour of code for the representatives
00:05 - from those groups who are here today can
00:07 - you raise your hands
00:09 - can we get a round of applause for all
00:10 - of the
00:12 - people on these committees
00:16 - lastly to the cs teachers who are tuning
00:18 - in over the live stream with your
00:19 - classrooms
00:20 - the work that you are doing in the
00:22 - classroom every day is the most
00:24 - important part of this movement thank
00:26 - you truly for the work you are doing to
00:27 - bring computer science to your
00:29 - classrooms can we get a round of
00:30 - applause for the teachers
00:31 - [Applause]
00:37 - now in the past we've kicked off
00:39 - computer science education week with
00:41 - world leaders such as barack obama and
00:44 - justin trudeau
00:45 - this year we're honored to be in silicon
00:48 - valley with leading women in tech
00:51 - susan cheryl
00:52 - and peggy johnson
00:54 - now
00:56 - the
00:56 - they are amazing but the computer
00:58 - science education sorry women in
01:00 - computer science actually goes back to
01:02 - the very beginning
01:03 - computer science education week is held
01:05 - in december every year to commemorate
01:07 - two women
01:08 - ada lovelace who was born on december 10
01:11 - 1815
01:13 - and designed the very first computer
01:14 - program
01:15 - and grace hopper who was born almost 100
01:18 - years later on december 9 1906 and has
01:21 - been a pioneer in the field of computer
01:23 - science
01:25 - while the tech industry today is mostly
01:26 - male the teacher-led movement to bring
01:29 - computer science to our classrooms is
01:31 - dominated by women in our
01:34 - workshops we see that about 86 percent
01:37 - of the teachers attending to teach
01:38 - computer science to their classrooms are
01:40 - women and we have leading women who are
01:43 - inspiring
01:45 - running the organizations many
01:46 - organizations in this space including
01:48 - deborah seahorn who is currently running
01:50 - the computer science teachers
01:51 - association and is here today and we'll
01:54 - get to hear from her later
01:56 - now for hundreds
01:58 - yes for debra absolutely
02:00 - [Applause]
02:02 - for hundreds of thousands of teachers
02:04 - around the world their journey began
02:06 - with an hour of code during computer
02:08 - science education week this week
02:12 - and at this point
02:13 - over the last four years we've had four
02:16 - hundred thousand four hundred million
02:19 - hours of code done around the world and
02:21 - this week we're going to hit
02:23 - 500 million hours of code served
02:27 - [Applause]
02:31 - but an hour is only the beginning and
02:33 - most of the teachers go beyond an hour
02:36 - to teach years of computer science in
02:37 - their classrooms in the last four years
02:40 - we've seen incredible momentum
02:42 - we've had over 120 school districts
02:45 - start teaching computer science we've
02:47 - had 40 states pass policies to support
02:50 - computer science and a dozen countries
02:53 - have added computer science to their
02:55 - national curriculum
02:57 - that is only the beginning and today
02:59 - with the announcements you're going to
03:00 - hear today you're going to see how fast
03:03 - this is growing at this point the
03:04 - computer science education movement
03:07 - is the fastest growing movement in the
03:10 - history of education
03:13 - [Applause]
03:18 - now to kick off
03:19 - this worldwide event i'm pleased to have
03:22 - peggy johnson
03:25 - susan wojcicki and sheryl sandberg here
03:27 - today i'd like to first introduce peggy
03:30 - johnson
03:31 - an executive vice president of business
03:33 - development at microsoft peggy oversees
03:35 - microsoft's partnerships acquisitions
03:38 - and venture fund
03:39 - previously peggy spent 24 years at
03:42 - qualcomm in leadership positions across
03:44 - engineering sales and business
03:46 - development
03:47 - she has been recognized by multiple
03:48 - organizations including business insider
03:51 - as the number one most powerful female
03:54 - engineer in 2017. please join me in
03:57 - welcoming peggy johnson
04:08 - how about this one how about this one
04:11 - there you go y'all can hear me
04:13 - thank you uh alice and hottie very much
04:15 - it's um on behalf of microsoft it's a
04:17 - real honor to be here and to celebrate
04:19 - the wonderful code.org community
04:22 - um co.org's mission is deeply personal
04:25 - to me i am an engineer
04:28 - at college i learned a code and my first
04:30 - job
04:31 - outside of college was coding and
04:33 - computer science has in many ways been
04:36 - the foundation of my career it's really
04:38 - changed my life
04:40 - but i have to say um it almost was an
04:42 - accident it wasn't supposed to be that
04:44 - way and i'll give you a little bit of
04:45 - the back story on that
04:47 - i am one of 15 kids so i have 14
04:50 - brothers and sisters in my family um
04:52 - there's a little bit irish catholic in
04:54 - there that's how that happened um
04:57 - but i had the uh the unenviable position
04:59 - i wasn't the oldest i wasn't the
05:01 - youngest i was one of the 13 in the
05:02 - middle so for those of you who remember
05:04 - the brady bunch i definitely had some
05:06 - jan brady syndrome but my parents had
05:09 - two rules um one you had to go to
05:12 - college and two you had to pay for it
05:14 - yourself
05:15 - so uh following my older brothers and
05:17 - sisters as younger siblings do they had
05:19 - already uh gone off to college and many
05:21 - of them had become business majors and
05:23 - so i just sort of followed in their
05:24 - footsteps went off to san diego state
05:27 - got a job on campus and started my what
05:30 - i thought was going to be my my business
05:32 - degree
05:33 - and one day i find myself delivering a
05:35 - package to the engineering department a
05:38 - place i have never been to before in my
05:40 - life i didn't even know where it was i'd
05:42 - ask people how to get there
05:43 - so i walk in and i struck up a
05:46 - conversation with the two executive
05:48 - assistants who were behind the desk
05:50 - and who were strangely so excited to see
05:53 - me and what i didn't realize is they'd
05:55 - just been having a conversation about
05:57 - how they could get
05:58 - more women into engineering
06:01 - and the sad fact was they just they they
06:04 - tried they just couldn't get more in and
06:06 - all of a sudden i showed up in front of
06:08 - them so these two ladies they went to
06:10 - work on me they sat me down
06:12 - on the clock by the way
06:13 - and they said so what are you studying
06:15 - you know what are you going to be
06:17 - do you like math and science have you
06:19 - ever considered
06:21 - seeking a degree in engineering and
06:24 - frankly to be really honest no i didn't
06:26 - even really know what engineers did to
06:28 - tell you the truth there was no
06:30 - engineers in my family growing up there
06:32 - you know it was business majors
06:34 - and these two ladies just started
06:36 - working on me and working on me and i
06:37 - remember something that still resonates
06:39 - with me today they said the world will
06:41 - be your oyster if you pursue an
06:43 - engineering degree
06:45 - and the next morning i woke up changed
06:46 - my major to engineering and i tell you
06:48 - this story because it has a lot to do
06:50 - with luck when i looked around at my
06:53 - classes they were it was under 10 and
06:55 - the double e department were women i was
06:58 - i was just there by pure luck because of
07:00 - this package i had dropped off
07:03 - and frankly
07:04 - the
07:05 - the issue is that for too many of our
07:08 - young women today for too many of our
07:09 - young people of color for too many young
07:11 - people all together
07:13 - luck is still too much a part of the
07:14 - equation and as computer scientists
07:18 - luck is not a variable we like to deal
07:20 - with data okay probability odds things
07:23 - we can change but luck not so much
07:26 - and for me i wanted to be able to to
07:29 - change this number and
07:32 - for you the opportunity is there every
07:35 - day
07:36 - we are improving the odds with our kids
07:38 - when teachers introduce them to our of
07:41 - code when schools and districts scrape
07:43 - money together to get a computer
07:45 - scientist on their payroll and every day
07:49 - we can change a kid's life by saying to
07:51 - them hey have you ever thought about
07:54 - pursuing a degree
07:56 - and hey have you ever thought about
07:58 - going after coding and learning how to
08:00 - code
08:01 - so it's really incumbent upon all of us
08:03 - to to change that equation
08:06 - um
08:08 - in computer science
08:09 - or sorry
08:11 - code.org is all about
08:14 - really it's all about changing that
08:16 - equation leveling the playing field for
08:18 - all of these young kids it's why
08:20 - microsoft is so deeply involved in the
08:23 - program we're a founding member of it
08:25 - and we're continuing to embrace that
08:27 - vision because every child should have
08:29 - the opportunity to be able to change the
08:32 - world and coding is one way that they
08:33 - can do that no matter where she was born
08:36 - no matter who her parents are no matter
08:38 - what hallway she walked down to get
08:40 - there so thanks very much i hope you
08:41 - enjoy the rest of the day
08:43 - [Applause]
08:53 - thank you peggy
08:54 - and now i would like to introduce you to
08:57 - susan wojcicki susan wojcicki is the ceo
08:59 - of youtube the world's most popular
09:01 - digital video platform used by over a
09:04 - billion people across the globe to
09:06 - access information share video and shape
09:08 - culture an early champion of online
09:11 - video who was instrumental in google's
09:13 - 2006 acquisition of youtube susan now
09:16 - oversees youtube's content and business
09:18 - operations engineering and product
09:20 - development please join me in welcoming
09:22 - susan to the stage
09:24 - [Applause]
09:30 - all right
09:31 - so good morning everyone i'm thrilled to
09:33 - be here at this very special event
09:36 - and be here among students and educators
09:40 - administrators tech leaders celebrating
09:42 - something that just does not get enough
09:44 - attention that should get a lot more
09:47 - attention which is computer science
09:49 - education
09:50 - um so let me tell you my own story which
09:52 - in some ways is actually similar to
09:54 - peggy's story about how i developed my
09:57 - own passion for computer science
10:00 - so as a kid i was always doing creative
10:02 - projects drawing painting
10:05 - candle making
10:07 - mosaic making paper making you know all
10:10 - those favorite all those little art kits
10:12 - they sell in the store for kids i
10:14 - probably you know always wanted to do
10:16 - every single one of them
10:18 - the thing is i had never connected that
10:20 - computer science was actually a creative
10:23 - way of making
10:26 - services products
10:27 - that had the impact to change the world
10:30 - so
10:31 - um what happened to me was i didn't
10:34 - pursue it i actually have a degree in
10:36 - history and literature
10:37 - and
10:38 - my senior year in college
10:40 - i
10:42 - by accident
10:43 - interned
10:44 - at a startup
10:46 - i actually worked for this temporary
10:48 - service i used to come home from college
10:50 - and say
10:51 - just send me wherever you want sometimes
10:53 - they sent me to lawyers office doctor's
10:55 - offices everywhere and one time by
10:57 - accident i was sent to a startup and
11:00 - after i was there for a few days i
11:02 - realized wow there's something
11:03 - interesting here and i was answering the
11:05 - phone at this place and i thought you
11:07 - know i actually would like to do more
11:08 - than answer the phone i think i could do
11:10 - the same type of work as the people here
11:12 - in the office how do i do that
11:14 - i'm going to take a computer science
11:15 - class
11:17 - now i was a senior in college writing my
11:19 - thesis studying history and literature
11:22 - and i thought surely it is too late for
11:24 - me because i'm 20 and i'm a senior and
11:28 - my life has already been decided um and
11:31 - i just can't change but i had a friend
11:34 - and she was taking a computer science
11:36 - class and i always think back to that
11:38 - about how influential everyone can be
11:40 - whether they're a student if you're an
11:42 - eighth grader you can influence a sixth
11:43 - grader so my friend was taking a
11:45 - computer science class and i thought you
11:46 - know if she's taking it i can probably
11:49 - take it so here i was i signed up for
11:51 - computer science my senior year as a
11:53 - history and literature major um and took
11:55 - it and that's how i discovered my
11:57 - passion for computer science
12:01 - uh
12:02 - um
12:04 - it was it was amazing to me that this
12:06 - one class
12:07 - really changed my life
12:09 - and i'm always grateful and think wow my
12:11 - life could have been very different if i
12:13 - hadn't had that one experience in that
12:15 - one class now i was very lucky to take
12:18 - this class
12:19 - but in today's world where technology is
12:22 - changing every single thing we do it
12:24 - shouldn't be about a matter of luck
12:27 - computer science actually does a lot in
12:30 - data as we talked about and
12:32 - computer science is something that
12:34 - should be available to all students
12:38 - students also shouldn't have to wait
12:39 - until college
12:41 - i'm amazed the way a two-year-old can
12:42 - pick up a phone
12:44 - and figure out how to use it our kids
12:46 - today are digital natives they should
12:48 - have the access to learning computer
12:49 - science today in their school
12:52 - but many kids do not have that
12:54 - opportunity google commissioned a study
12:57 - and it showed that only 40 percent
12:59 - of kids in k-12 schools in the u.s offer
13:02 - computer science class and have access
13:04 - to them
13:06 - and as low as that number is the good
13:08 - news is it's an improvement because two
13:10 - years ago the number was only ten
13:12 - percent um so it shows that we can make
13:14 - progress when we focus on it and i do
13:16 - think code.org definitely had something
13:18 - to do with raising the number from 10 to
13:20 - 40 percent but we still have 60 the
13:23 - majority of kids still are not getting
13:25 - computer science and that's why there's
13:27 - so much important work left to do
13:30 - now it also has an impact on diversity
13:33 - the ap exam for computer science has the
13:36 - worst racial diversity of any ap course
13:40 - only 22 percent of students who take the
13:42 - course are students of color
13:45 - and black students in particular are
13:47 - less likely to have access to computer
13:49 - science classes compared to white and
13:51 - hispanic students so unless we make
13:53 - computer science something that is
13:55 - available to everybody
13:57 - we risk making these racial disparities
13:59 - worse
14:01 - now on the other hand if we provide it
14:03 - to everyone we also have an opportunity
14:05 - to benefit everyone and if you look at
14:07 - the economy you look at the importance
14:09 - that technology and tech jobs play in
14:11 - our society there are nearly half a
14:13 - million open computing jobs in the u.s
14:16 - in every
14:17 - state in every industry and they are
14:19 - projected to grow at twice the rate
14:22 - so we have a chance to enable all kids
14:24 - no matter where their background is
14:27 - where they come from which family they
14:29 - grew up with their only child or 15 one
14:31 - of 15
14:33 - to give them the opportunity to have
14:35 - these experiences
14:37 - google has been working to provide
14:40 - funding to non-profits to expand coding
14:42 - in schools we have our made for code
14:45 - initiative to inspire girls to take
14:47 - coding and as part of cs week we're
14:49 - encouraging students to also try the
14:50 - hour of code and we're doing a project
14:53 - to build a holiday emoji so if you're
14:55 - looking for a good project to do with
14:56 - your kid
14:58 - this is one and you can create your own
14:59 - google logo with the special coding
15:01 - activity and we also have a google
15:03 - doodle that encourages people to
15:06 - solve a puzzle using simple block
15:09 - block coding
15:10 - so i'm very happy to be here kicking off
15:12 - this week i can't emphasize enough how
15:14 - important this area is for every kid out
15:18 - there in the future and for our
15:20 - community our society our country
15:24 - and the opportunity to enable all those
15:26 - great kids out there in the world to
15:27 - really be the next leaders in technology
15:29 - and to make a difference for our world
15:31 - so thank you for being here i'm excited
15:33 - to kick off all the projects that we're
15:34 - going to be doing together thank you
15:39 - [Applause]
15:43 - thank you susan
15:45 - and now please join me in welcoming
15:46 - sheryl sandberg
15:48 - the chief operating officer at facebook
15:51 - cheryl has overseen facebook's business
15:53 - operations as ceo for the past nine
15:56 - years when she joined in 2008 facebook
15:59 - had 70 million users and 550 employees
16:02 - the like button had yet to be invented
16:06 - today over 2 billion people around the
16:08 - world chase check facebook every single
16:11 - day and the company employs more than 23
16:14 - 000 people
16:15 - please join me in welcoming cheryl
16:17 - [Applause]
16:25 - well i am so um honored and excited to
16:27 - be here today with this community who
16:29 - are really leading the investment in
16:32 - computer science in our area
16:34 - and we all know how important that is
16:38 - um joining peggy and joining susan i'm
16:41 - grateful for your friendship and your
16:43 - leadership
16:44 - we all are here to make
16:47 - feels weird to have this i guess i could
16:49 - put this
16:50 - i guess i could just put that right in
16:51 - there you see
16:53 - the kind of expertise you get when you
16:55 - work in technology
16:58 - we all know how important this field of
17:00 - study is both in what computer science
17:03 - gives us
17:05 - in terms of the products we build the
17:07 - impact the products have in the world
17:09 - but also opportunity for people
17:12 - i am just so proud of hadi and alice and
17:15 - the team of code.org hattie and ali have
17:18 - been long-term friends of mine really
17:20 - helped me transition
17:22 - to silicon valley and the work code.org
17:24 - is doing which is really transforming
17:26 - education and giving millions of
17:28 - students who otherwise would have no
17:30 - access and no exposure to computer
17:32 - science i really believe can change our
17:34 - country so congratulations to both of
17:36 - you and your team for your leadership
17:43 - the thing about jobs and technology is
17:46 - they are incredibly high impact
17:48 - incredibly high paying and incredibly
17:50 - flexible
17:51 - and when you think about what people
17:53 - entering the workforce want they really
17:54 - want the ability to make a difference
17:56 - and i think all of us in this room know
17:58 - that there's probably no better field to
18:01 - do that than the field of technology
18:03 - people also want in increasingly
18:05 - economic uncertain times
18:08 - job stability and the ability to know
18:10 - that they can always get a job and no
18:13 - matter what's happening really in any
18:15 - economy right now anywhere in the world
18:17 - the people who have more than full
18:19 - employment are the people with these
18:21 - technical degrees despite all of the
18:23 - concerns about unemployment we have in
18:26 - our economy and so many others
18:28 - there is a huge gap in unfilled
18:32 - technology jobs not just here but all
18:34 - around the world so if we're looking for
18:36 - the answer for economic growth for
18:38 - financial stability for families
18:41 - getting more of our children into these
18:43 - fields we know is a huge part of the
18:45 - answer
18:46 - it's also the case that when i think
18:48 - about what families need women and men
18:51 - to be flexible to have both careers and
18:54 - personal lives so that women are no
18:56 - longer no longer say to women you can't
18:58 - do both something we never say to men
19:01 - these are
19:02 - always these are almost always
19:05 - the most flexible jobs you can have we
19:08 - used to have a joke at facebook that we
19:10 - and it's not sure anymore but for many
19:12 - many years we had this unbelievable
19:14 - programmer that really no one had ever
19:16 - met
19:17 - because he didn't like to work in the
19:18 - office with other people
19:20 - but he was
19:22 - unbelievably productive
19:24 - and for people in this field who are
19:26 - unbelievably productive the type of
19:29 - flexibility we are willing to offer them
19:31 - and all the companies are willing to
19:32 - offer them
19:33 - shows how you can really integrate both
19:36 - a personal life and a professional life
19:38 - so really on any metric on anything we
19:41 - care about whether it's society or
19:43 - opportunity or impact or having jobs or
19:45 - being able to balance work and family
19:48 - this is an unbelievable field
19:50 - the problem is we do not give equal
19:53 - access to people to get in there 98
19:57 - of the people majoring in computer
19:59 - science and colleges were exposed to
20:01 - computer science before they went to
20:03 - college
20:04 - that's an amazing statistic and that
20:06 - shows how important the work code.org
20:08 - and so many people in this room are
20:10 - doing we also have to think about
20:13 - not just getting the usual suspects into
20:15 - this field but getting everyone into
20:17 - this field
20:18 - women were 35 of computer science majors
20:21 - in the 1980s it's 18
20:24 - today
20:25 - many years ago i hosted a summer party
20:27 - for
20:28 - a bunch of the facebook summer interns
20:30 - and there were so many boys like eight
20:32 - years ago and i said to one of them like
20:33 - where are all the girls and he looked up
20:36 - at me and said
20:37 - there are more daves than girls in my
20:40 - major in college and i looked at him i
20:43 - thought he was joking he was like no i
20:44 - counted
20:45 - there are this many people named dave
20:47 - and this many girls majoring in computer
20:50 - science at my school
20:51 - that's a problem and unfortunately one
20:53 - we are not making progress against
20:56 - same situation for the black and
20:57 - hispanic community is only 15 percent of
21:00 - the people majoring in these fields are
21:02 - black or hispanic and so what we need is
21:05 - equal access to computer science
21:07 - education and to motivate and excite
21:10 - everyone and let them know that this is
21:12 - a field they can excel in
21:14 - this is a field where they can really
21:16 - achieve and this is important so that we
21:18 - get to equal representation so that the
21:21 - products we build reflect the diversity
21:24 - not just of the people who use them but
21:26 - of the people who build them
21:28 - this is a really big priority for
21:30 - facebook we are putting large
21:33 - investments into funding into training
21:35 - support and jobs
21:36 - uh there we have lots and lots and lots
21:38 - of programs but i'll mention two i'm
21:39 - most proud of the first is we launched
21:42 - computer science and engineering lean in
21:44 - circles with facebook linkedin the anita
21:47 - borg foundation and my foundation the
21:49 - lean in foundation and the idea lean in
21:51 - circles are small groups
21:53 - that meet to support each other
21:56 - i think eight or ten people even though
21:58 - we have one in houston that they say
22:00 - they have 200 and they say everything's
22:02 - bigger in texas so they don't have eight
22:03 - they have 200. but it's any group of
22:06 - women or men who meet once a month
22:07 - together using the materials we provide
22:10 - for free to lean in to support each
22:12 - other in their ambitions a few years ago
22:14 - we launched computer science and
22:16 - engineering specific lean in circles
22:18 - to solve the problem for girls that they
22:20 - are surrounded by daves and not by girls
22:24 - so if there's only a few girls or one in
22:26 - their computer science
22:28 - class they're in a group that meets
22:30 - regularly to support them we now have
22:32 - over 250 circles and we're covering a
22:35 - huge number of campuses and we're
22:37 - grateful for the opportunity to work
22:39 - with those folks
22:40 - we also are working on tech prep with
22:42 - mckinsey we really studied what leads to
22:44 - a computer science path
22:46 - 90 of parents who want their children to
22:49 - learn cs but 77 have no idea how to
22:52 - pursue it so this is an online resource
22:55 - hub designed to reach parents we've now
22:57 - reached 1 million people in 50 states
23:00 - and i know that google and microsoft and
23:01 - other companies are talking about making
23:03 - really important investments and again
23:05 - i'm so grateful to susan and peggy for
23:07 - the partnership our companies have had
23:09 - on this
23:10 - we're at the beginning of our journey
23:13 - and the opportunity for us to come here
23:15 - and celebrate the people in this
23:16 - community who are leading who are making
23:19 - computer science accessible and open to
23:22 - the usual suspects we want everyone but
23:24 - also to more women and traditionally
23:27 - underrepresented minorities
23:29 - i'm really grateful
23:31 - when i think about all the problems we
23:33 - face and there are real problems right
23:34 - now i think about what makes me
23:37 - optimistic
23:39 - and what is core to being a technologist
23:43 - is that we believe that the future will
23:45 - be better than the past
23:47 - not perfect not the technology will
23:49 - solve every problem not the technology
23:51 - doesn't cause some of the problems we're
23:53 - realists and we understand all that
23:55 - but we believe fundamentally deep in our
23:58 - hearts
23:59 - that the power of technology is one that
24:01 - lifts people out of poverty gives people
24:02 - opportunity and brings us closer
24:04 - together
24:06 - and
24:06 - that will continue to happen due to the
24:08 - great work of the people in this room
24:10 - for which we are super grateful thank
24:12 - you
24:15 - [Applause]
24:23 - thank you cheryl

36:37 - that just this week code.org hit a major
36:41 - milestone we just passed 10 million
36:44 - girls who have created accounts on our
36:46 - platform and to put that in perspective
36:48 - that's a lot of girls to put that in
36:50 - perspective
36:52 - cheryl was talking about the lack of
36:53 - diversity in our universities if just
36:56 - one percent of the girls who coded on
36:59 - code.org in the last year were to go on
37:01 - and study computer science in college
37:04 - that would more than make up for the
37:06 - gender gap that we have today so uh you
37:09 - know and the work that this has come
37:11 - from is really all due to the teachers
37:13 - um who are bringing this to our
37:15 - classroom every day so i want to one
37:17 - last round of applause to those teachers
37:19 - who have introduced 10 million girls to
37:22 - computer science

37:30 - announcements and we saved the best for
37:32 - last
37:33 - we heard about all the international
37:35 - governments doing work for computer
37:37 - science and i'm glad to let you know
37:40 - that right here in the u.s we also have
37:43 - governments making new policies for
37:45 - computer science to tell us more about
37:46 - this i'd like to introduce cameron
37:48 - wilson he's our chief operating officer
37:50 - and the president of the code.org
37:52 - advocacy coalition
37:55 - [Applause]
38:02 - thank you alice i appreciate the chance
38:04 - to be here this morning the movement to
38:06 - bring computer science into our schools
38:08 - uh also means we need to update state
38:10 - policies to sustain this momentum for
38:12 - years to come
38:14 - policy leaders incl increasingly
38:16 - recognize every student should have the
38:18 - opportunity to take high quality
38:20 - computer science in k-12 this will
38:22 - unlock innovation opportunity and
38:24 - economic growth in their communities and
38:26 - enable students regardless of their
38:28 - gender race or background to participate
38:31 - in our rapidly growing digital economy
38:34 - and at a time when our country is
38:35 - divided this issue can also heal this
38:38 - divide political leaders from both major
38:41 - parties are working together to pass
38:43 - computer science policies
38:45 - as a result
38:47 - in the past four years 40 states have
38:49 - enacted policies to expand computer
38:51 - science education
38:53 - and i am pleased to announce new policy
38:55 - pledges this week from states to expand
38:58 - k-12 computer science governor scott in
39:00 - florida has pledged 15 million dollars
39:03 - for k-12 computer science professional
39:05 - development for the state's teachers
39:08 - the hawaiian state department of
39:09 - education is committed to a process to
39:12 - review and update its k-12 computer
39:14 - science standards
39:15 - and today the governors of alabama
39:18 - montana pennsylvania north dakota and
39:22 - indiana are all joining the governor's
39:24 - partnership for k-12 computer science
39:26 - education
39:27 - this bipartisan coalition of governors
39:30 - now 14 strong
39:32 - are all committed to working toward
39:34 - three goals in their states
39:36 - first that at least every high school
39:38 - will offer a computer science course
39:41 - second there will be funding for
39:42 - professional learning for computer
39:44 - science teachers
39:46 - third that the state will have rigorous
39:48 - k-12 computer science standards
39:50 - and now i'm pleased to introduce three
39:52 - governors who couldn't be here today but
39:54 - wanted to send a personal message by
39:55 - video with their new commitments to this
39:58 - movement
40:05 - hi this is governor asa hutchinson of
40:07 - the great state of arkansas from the
40:10 - moment my 11 year old granddaughter
40:12 - helped me to understand the importance
40:13 - of computer science for our future
40:16 - it has been a priority for me in the
40:18 - first month of my administration
40:20 - arkansas became the first state in the
40:22 - nation to require all public high
40:24 - schools to teach computer coding
40:27 - with the support of anthony owen my
40:29 - director of computer science and our
40:31 - educators statewide arkansas continues
40:34 - to lead the way in computer coding
40:36 - education one of our highly successful
40:39 - initiatives was to provide two thousand
40:42 - dollars stipends for high school
40:44 - teachers to learn to teach coding
40:46 - the enrollment in coding classes has
40:48 - increased dramatically
40:50 - teacher preparation is key to any
40:52 - successful educational initiative so
40:55 - with that success under our wings i am
40:58 - pleased to announce that arkansas is
41:00 - allocating five hundred thousand dollars
41:03 - of its computer science initiative
41:05 - budget to fund a first of its kind
41:07 - program to provide a two thousand dollar
41:09 - stipend for elementary and middle school
41:12 - teachers who train to become
41:14 - computer science lead teachers i'm proud
41:17 - to lead the state that is leading the
41:19 - way in computer science in his schools
41:22 - thank you
41:30 - hi i'm steve bullock governor montana
41:33 - montana's technology sector continues to
41:35 - grow we're seeing an increased demand
41:38 - for workers trained in computer science
41:40 - fields
41:42 - it's projected we'll need to fill nearly
41:44 - 30 000 computer science jobs over these
41:47 - next 10 years
41:49 - at the same time more and more jobs in
41:51 - all sectors require employees with
41:53 - strong problem solving and critical
41:56 - thinking skills that are integral to
41:58 - stem and computer science training
42:01 - we're serious about preparing montana
42:03 - students for these high demand and high
42:05 - paying jobs which is why i'm pleased to

42:58 - to be the home of such cutting-edge
43:00 - companies like eli lilly cook and
43:02 - cummins
43:03 - and today we are one of the fastest
43:06 - growing states for tech employment
43:09 - indiana knows that computer science is a
43:11 - foundational subject that touches all
43:14 - areas of study and fields of work and we
43:16 - are proud to be one of the first states
43:18 - to embed computer science in our k
43:21 - through 8 standards
43:23 - but we need to continue to expand access
43:25 - to help ensure that all hoosiers are
43:27 - equipped with the tools they need to
43:29 - succeed in today's rapidly evolving
43:32 - economy
43:33 - that's why i am proud to announce that a
43:36 - key piece of my 2018 next level agenda
43:40 - is to require all k through 12 schools
43:42 - across indiana to offer computer science
43:45 - by 2021
43:47 - and that we provide the resources
43:49 - necessary for professional development
43:51 - so that we have the teachers in the
43:53 - classroom that will allow us to meet
43:55 - this goal
43:57 - i am also pleased to announce that i am
43:59 - joining the governors for computer
44:01 - science partnership a bipartisan
44:04 - initiative to promote computer science

44:10 - colleagues to help advocate for policies
44:12 - that expand computer science education
44:16 - thank you for all you're doing to
44:17 - support computer science education i'm
44:21 - excited for what this means for the
44:22 - future of our state
44:29 - let's give a round of applause for our
44:31 - uh state level commitments we really
44:33 - appreciate entire states getting behind
44:35 - this movement so thank you
44:41 - so since we're in california for this
44:43 - kickoff we're very excited to have one
44:45 - of the state's top leaders with us today
44:48 - lieutenant governor gavin newsom is here
44:50 - to help
44:51 - share what steps california is taking to
44:53 - expand computer science education for
44:56 - every student
44:58 - lieutenant governor newsom was elected
44:59 - as lieutenant governor of california in
45:01 - 2010
45:02 - after serving as mayor of san francisco
45:05 - for eight years
45:06 - as a member of the san francisco board
45:08 - of supervisors
45:10 - and then as mayor of san francisco and
45:12 - now as lieutenant governor of california
45:14 - who's been in leadership for a long time
45:16 - in the state
45:17 - new lieutenant governor newsom has been
45:19 - a national leader on issues of equity
45:21 - the environment homelessness healthcare
45:24 - policies he has initiated and
45:26 - implemented have been duplicated in
45:28 - cities across the united states
45:31 - now as lieutenant governor and in his
45:32 - role as the university
45:35 - uh
45:36 - as a university of california regent
45:38 - and cal state university trustee he's
45:41 - pushing to expand computer science
45:43 - education
45:44 - in
45:45 - our universities and k-12 classrooms so
45:47 - please
45:49 - provide a warm round of applause in
45:51 - welcoming lieutenant governor newsom to
45:52 - the stage
45:54 - [Applause]
45:58 - so i guess you guys did that purposely
46:00 - you rub it in with arkansas and indiana
46:02 - which trust me
46:04 - that ain't easy sitting here
46:06 - listening to those governors get ahead
46:08 - of california i i'm going to spare
46:10 - montana because i got married there and
46:12 - my daughter's name montana
46:14 - but i admire
46:16 - and appreciate their leadership and the
46:18 - question is where's california we've got
46:20 - to step up our game
46:22 - we haven't been out front we love to say
46:24 - about our state the future happened
46:26 - future happened here first but not as it
46:28 - relates to
46:30 - requiring computer science in all of our
46:34 - high schools
46:35 - we're actually trailing we've been
46:37 - falling behind
46:38 - and as you all know in a world where
46:40 - tech is racing ahead
46:42 - if education falls behind
46:45 - where does that leave us with more
46:47 - acuity in terms of wealth gaps more
46:49 - acuity in terms of income gaps more
46:52 - questions about the issues of social
46:55 - mobility the issues that i would argue
46:57 - disproportionately will define our times
47:00 - not as a way to begrudge other people's
47:02 - success but as a framework of a paradigm
47:05 - a gap that must be mined particularly in
47:08 - california the wealthiest and the
47:11 - poorest state in america eight million
47:14 - people i want to remind you living below
47:16 - the poverty line in the state of
47:17 - california when you look at the
47:18 - supplemental poverty index no state has
47:21 - more children
47:22 - living below the poverty line in the
47:24 - state of california this bifurcated
47:27 - hybrid reality a coastal economy and one
47:30 - struggling in the inland part of the
47:32 - state disproportionately so rather than
47:34 - lamenting about it we're here doing
47:36 - something about it and i want to just
47:38 - congratulate peggy and susan and cheryl
47:41 - code.org the great work of julie and
47:44 - access and all the enlightened
47:46 - leadership in this room for forcing us
47:50 - to get our act together to get out front
47:53 - and to advance an initiative we call
47:55 - cs4ca
47:58 - and that's simply this a goal
48:00 - a very comprehensive goal at scale
48:03 - respectfully the governors of those
48:05 - other states at scale
48:07 - to require cs in every high school in
48:11 - the state of california by
48:13 - 2025. we can achieve that
48:16 - and we are now committed to achieving
48:18 - that the governor just signed a bill
48:20 - i know program passing is not problem
48:22 - solving but we passed at least a
48:24 - commitment to establish a framework
48:28 - a strategic framework to implement a
48:31 - strategy with equity at the foundational
48:34 - principle of a paradigm
48:36 - 27
48:38 - that's the number of girls that took ap
48:41 - computer science last year that's it
48:43 - just 27
48:45 - of the 10 plus thousand people that took
48:47 - it in 2016 and this is jaw-dropping
48:50 - less than 150 african-americans
48:54 - 10 plus thousand people took ap computer
48:57 - science in the state of california less
48:58 - than 150
49:00 - were african-american but less than 1500
49:02 - by the way latino
49:04 - it's a majority minority state
49:07 - cannot have this conversation without
49:08 - having the question of equity being
49:11 - front and center that's the question we
49:12 - need to answer that's the question that
49:15 - will define our success or failure in
49:17 - these initiatives so we're going to step
49:20 - up our game we're going to make
49:22 - financial commitments we've got
49:24 - audacious goals that we will reach
49:27 - we have the core competency reflected in
49:30 - the work that all of you have been doing
49:32 - on this issue and we have the imperative
49:34 - in closing and that is the recognition
49:37 - that the plumbing of the world is
49:39 - radically changed
49:40 - you all know this we're going from
49:42 - something old to something new someone
49:44 - described it the other day as paralysis
49:47 - contrasted by rebirth
49:49 - when they described the taxicab industry
49:52 - versus uber and lyft and others
49:55 - it's a world where we ain't seen nothing
49:58 - yet
49:59 - you know that better than i the
50:00 - combinatorial nature of technology the
50:03 - stacking of technologies what's
50:05 - happening in this space
50:07 - is going to create conditions where the
50:10 - urgency of this moment
50:12 - cannot be underscored and so i just want
50:15 - to again compliment all of you for your
50:17 - guidance your wisdom your faith devotion
50:20 - to cause for
50:21 - problem solving uh and
50:24 - for the innovative spirit that defines
50:26 - the best of this state it's time to move
50:30 - away from downloading apps to have our
50:32 - kids start designing apps
50:34 - moving away from just plain on your
50:37 - phone to start actually programming that
50:40 - phone that's the spirit of this moment
50:42 - that's the spirit of this movement and
50:44 - that's a spirit that defines at least
50:47 - my modest participation uh here today
50:50 - thank you all very very much
51:02 - wow it's uh great to see states
51:04 - competing with each other to uh outdo
51:06 - each other for computer science uh we
51:08 - like to foster that competitive the
51:10 - competitive spirit of code.org so we
51:12 - appreciate the commitments to california

60:28 - throughout the week or on the weekends
60:30 - because your parents were overprotective
60:33 - well i don't have a device's hearing
60:36 - parents less awkward and more cool but
60:38 - what i do have is a device that lets
60:40 - your parents know where you are when
60:42 - you're for a jog this way your parents
60:44 - will know that you indeed are running
60:47 - and nothing else
60:50 - it alerts your parents if you ever feel
60:51 - unsafe about your surroundings or
60:53 - location and it is waterproof i mean
60:56 - come on that deserves a round of
60:58 - applause

61:04 - and for you ladies that want to track
61:06 - your husbands this works too
61:11 - okay so
61:13 - i
61:14 - i actually thought about this idea when
61:16 - i was laying in bed thinking to myself
61:18 - oh how am i going to survive running
61:20 - 26.2 miles without getting extra
61:22 - practicing i asked my mom if she could
61:25 - go out and roam with me but she was
61:27 - tired from coming home from work and
61:28 - wouldn't um and didn't let me run by
61:30 - myself because she thought our neighbor
61:32 - our neighborhood was unsafe so that's
61:34 - how i came up with find you
61:38 - might be thinking what is the find you
61:39 - app well it is an app that connects to
61:42 - our wristband
61:43 - which every wristband has a unique code
61:45 - you enter and you only have to log in
61:46 - once and we also pair it up with google
61:48 - maps to find your
61:50 - wristband's exact location

62:28 - and finally to kick off cs education
62:31 - week we have a special special message
62:34 - from melinda gates
62:36 - i wanted to be with you in person
62:38 - especially after i saw the program what
62:41 - an amazing group of leaders
62:43 - but i'm grateful for the opportunity to
62:45 - thank every single teacher
62:48 - mentor and policy maker who is helping
62:51 - students fall in love with computers and
62:53 - technology
62:54 - you're changing lives and i know that's
62:57 - true because i still remember the
62:58 - teacher who changed my life mrs bauer
63:02 - in 1982 she saw the apple ii computer at
63:05 - a math teachers conference and she
63:08 - persuaded the head of our school to buy
63:10 - one and then inspired me to imagine a
63:13 - different future
63:15 - that kind of inspiration and imagination
63:18 - is even more important today than it was
63:20 - back in the 1980s
63:23 - computer literacy is now an essential
63:25 - skill
63:26 - along with reading writing and
63:28 - arithmetic
63:29 - every student and i mean every student
63:32 - needs to learn his or her way around a
63:34 - computer but computer science education
63:36 - does even more than change lives it also
63:39 - changes the world
63:41 - it gives young people the power to build
63:43 - the future and the more we encourage
63:46 - different kinds of people to get
63:48 - interested in technology the better that
63:50 - future will be
63:52 - innovation happens when we approach
63:54 - urgent challenges from every different
63:56 - point of view bringing women and
63:59 - underrepresented minorities into the
64:01 - field guarantees that we see the full
64:04 - range of solutions to the real problems
64:07 - that people face in the world
64:09 - so one of the reasons i'm so optimistic
64:12 - about the future is that technology can
64:15 - make the impossible
64:17 - possible
64:18 - but only if we're all involved in the
64:21 - effort
64:22 - and that's what cs education is all
64:24 - about i hope you're leaving this event
64:27 - feeling motivated there's a big bright
64:30 - future waiting for our young women and
64:33 - young men
64:34 - together we can help them seize it
64:38 - thank you
64:40 - [Applause]
64:45 - and with that i think we can all say
64:47 - that computer science education week is
64:49 - officially kicked off in the one hour we
64:52 - have been here hundreds of thousands of
