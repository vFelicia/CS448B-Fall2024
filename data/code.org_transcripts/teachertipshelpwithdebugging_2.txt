00:04 - Your students are going to get 
frustrated when they're debugging, that's a given.
00:09 - Just let them know that another 
pair of eyes is always going to be helpful,
00:14 - Ask them to look at their neighbors, or 
ask them to get you to look at their code,
00:20 - because there's just going to be one small 
little piece - it's the tiniest little thing.
00:25 - Another set of eyes is super helpful.
00:28 - I motivate students to debug in three ways: One, I just set the expectation, you are going to make mistakes.
00:38 - So expect to debug. Secondly, giving them 
debugging opportunities, whether that's
00:45 - the beginning of class, during the levels that 
we're working on, or as an end of day activity.
00:51 - And then highlighting the fact that the risks are 
low. When we debug, they can work on their debugging privately,
00:59 - with them and their device, and then 
they can share when they feel like they found it .
01:06 - And and no one else will know that, 
so highlighting those three things
01:09 - A student makes a mistake, and we all 
get into it, and we all try to problem solve.
01:14 - You create this community, you create 
this this idea that other people are there
01:19 - to help you. You can really build that into 
your class, and problem solving and debugging
01:25 - become part of a culture, and excitement 
instead of a frustration from our students.
