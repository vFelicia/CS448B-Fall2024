00:04 - You're about to get the chance to play
with a new type of puzzle, called the
00:09 - collector. These puzzles are a lot like
ones you've already seen except for a
00:15 - few important changes. In each puzzle, the collector will look for items to grab.
00:19 - When she gets to them, she won't be able
to simply run over the items to pick
00:23 - them up. Instead you will need to use the
collect block to grab each pile. Be
00:29 - careful! The number of items that need to
be collected to pass a level will change.
00:34 - Sometimes you only need to collect one
pile, and other puzzles, plan to collect
00:39 - everything. Make sure you pay attention
to the instructions to find out what the
00:43 - rules are before you start!
