00:01 - I was first introduced to computer science when I was in high school.
00:06 - My first experience with technology was when I was very young, about six years old.
00:11 - It was part of our curriculum at the school I went to.
00:14 - I made my way into computer science class and I loved it so much,
00:18 - that I ended up double majoring in both theatre and computer science.
00:22 - Growing up as a kid in the inner city, I never learned a thing about coding, and it's so important.
00:28 - All my girlfriends have taken a computer science class and I'm the odd person out right now.
00:34 - Having access to technology, and for me in particular, being able to code, was a multiplier.
00:40 - I wanted to do computer graphics, I wanted to be a graphic designer.
00:44 - And people found out, they laughed at me, you know, all these things. And I'm like "Man, I don't care, I think it's cool!"
00:49 - "I'm learning a lot, and some of my friends have jobs."
00:55 - Opportunities are endless for someone who's getting into computer science,
01:00 - that's a job that's in high demand right now.
01:02 - We have all different types of people who work in computer science.
01:07 - We need more participation by women, by more people of color, to provide a different perspective.
01:12 - To provide a different lens on which problems matter and how we should approach these problems.
01:15 - It's not just programming, it's not just building things, it's an entire different way of seeing the world.
01:22 - There's a way, that even when you're coding, you can help make this world a better place.
01:28 - It's a really fun place to be right now.
01:30 - I hope you guys want to be entrepreneurs, you wanna have your own business, you wanna create opportunities for your family.
01:35 - You wanna create your own app, or your own platform, or whatever.
01:39 - I'm here to say today, that you guys can do that.
01:43 - Computer science is for everyone, literally everyone. Some people think you need to be a genius to get in,
01:49 - and that's so far from the truth.
01:52 - I know it can be intimidating, and a lot of things are intimidating - but what isn't?
01:59 - Don't give up, don't be discouraged, don't let anybody tell you that you can't do something.
02:04 - If you're a high school student that's thought about taking computer science, just go after it!
02:10 - We need diverse teams of people, in order to make products that reflect what our world looks like.
02:16 - It's not just a means to an end, it's something that gives us hope, to solve every problem the world potentially has.
02:23 - We're on a mission to help change the face of computer science.
02:29 - We're gonna learn to code together, bring the family, gather around.
02:33 - Anybody can do it - you should try.
02:36 - Push yourself. Anybody can learn. Just give it a try,
