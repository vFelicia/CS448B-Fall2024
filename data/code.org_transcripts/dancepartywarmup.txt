00:01 - Hour of Code | Dance Party: Warm Up
00:07 - (Miral, Dancer and Software Developer, Created
iLuminate) - Hi!
00:11 - My name is Miral Kotb and I’m a dancer,
software developer, and creator of iLuminate.
00:16 - So, computer science relates to creativity
in numerous ways.
00:21 - Immeasurable, really.
00:22 - I mean, once you have the ability to write
software you can put ideas into anything.
00:28 - I do it with light suits.
00:30 - There's so much you can do once you have the
tools to write software, and the possibilities
00:35 - are really endless.
00:38 - Over the next hour, you’re going to get
started with computer science by programming
00:43 - your own dance party!
00:45 - We’ve assembled some hit music and a team
of great dancers for you to play with.
00:49 - You’ll be using blocks of code to choose
different dancers, change their dance moves,
00:56 - make them respond to the music, and make them
interactive.
01:00 - You’ll see that your screen is split into
three main parts.
01:05 - On the left is the play space.
01:06 - This is where your dancers will show up.
01:09 - This middle area is the toolbox.
01:12 - New blocks of code will be available in this
space as you go through the lessons.
01:18 - The space to the right is the workspace.
01:21 - You can drag blocks out of the toolbox and
into the workspace to build your program.
01:28 - The instructions for each level will be up
here at the top of the screen.
01:33 - If you need a hint, just click the light bulb.
01:40 - To start off, let’s make a new dancer with
this red block.
01:46 - First, drag it out of the toolbox and snap
it under this orange “setup” block.
01:52 - This dancer is a cat and its name is “my_first_dancer”.
01:57 - You can change the name to whatever you want
by clicking here.
02:03 - You can also change where the dancer appears
in your play space with this.
02:10 - Above the play space is a menu for picking
out music.
02:13 - There are a ton of songs to choose from so
have fun finding your favorites.
02:19 - Under the play space is the run button.
02:21 - When you press run, you’ll see the dancers
from your program appear in the play space
02:25 - and the music will play.
02:31 - [Music]
02:35 - Try it yourself!
02:37 - And if you’re feeling stuck, it's okay!
02:39 - Just get up and get moving, and before you
know it, you’ll have made your own dance
02:44 - party.
02:45 - So, what will you create?
