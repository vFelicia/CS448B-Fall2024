00:03 - wonderful well thank you everyone for
00:04 - joining us this evening tonight's
00:06 - webinar is called an Educator's Guide to
00:08 - the hour of code we have over a thousand
00:10 - people registered for the webinar
00:12 - tonight and so far over 200 have dialed
00:14 - into the call um all of you who are
00:16 - joining us this evening have come in
00:18 - automatically into the blue jeans
00:20 - platform on mute so you can see me you
00:23 - can see Laura and Alice you can see our
00:25 - slides but we cannot see and we cannot
00:28 - hear you so by um all means please get
00:31 - comfortable relax we got about an hour
00:33 - to talk about computer science together
00:34 - should be a great evening but just keep
00:36 - in mind that the only way we can
00:38 - communicate with you is through the chat
00:40 - pod which is on the side of your screen
00:42 - it looks somewhat like a little
00:43 - quotation bubble from a comic book so if
00:46 - you have a question a comment feedback
00:49 - or just want to say hello use that chat
00:51 - pod to go ahead and do that throughout
00:53 - the meeting um later on in the meeting
00:55 - we are going to have a Q&A discussion
00:58 - and at that time we will use the chat
01:00 - but we're also going to use the hand
01:01 - feature so on the side of your screen
01:03 - you should also see a little hand icon
01:06 - if you click on that that allows me as
01:08 - the moderator to activate your
01:10 - microphone and webcam for you so that
01:11 - you can interact with us and speak to us
01:14 - and we'll do that about halfway through
01:15 - the meeting um but for now let's just
01:17 - focus on using the chat pod um and I'll
01:20 - let you know when it's time to to raise
01:21 - your hand if you have a question we go
01:23 - to the next slide
01:26 - Laura thank you so um this event and
01:30 - Educators guide to hour of code is the
01:32 - third in a series of monthly webinars
01:34 - we've been hosting this fall here at
01:35 - code.org um previously we had a Q&A with
01:39 - our founder Hadi ptoi and um the last
01:42 - meeting that we had was a a sharing out
01:44 - of our evaluation program results but
01:47 - for the next two meetings that we're
01:48 - going to be having the one tonight and
01:50 - the one on December 2nd we're going to
01:51 - be focusing on the hour of cod so we're
01:54 - really glad that you're here to join us
01:55 - and um hope that you've brought your
01:57 - questions and your comments and your um
01:59 - best practices to
02:02 - share so tonight's presenters are um two
02:05 - of my favorite people at code.org just
02:07 - not just saying that because they're
02:09 - here tonight but it's actually true um
02:11 - Laura Klein is the manager of the hour
02:13 - of code program she's been working on
02:14 - hour of code since the very beginning um
02:17 - and uh has a lot of great insight to
02:19 - share with you I think you guys will
02:20 - love hearing from Laura and then Alice
02:22 - Stein glass is code.org is Vice
02:24 - President of product and marketing um
02:26 - and Alice has just been a really huge
02:28 - influence on hour of code this year I
02:30 - think that um a lot of the stuff she has
02:31 - to share will also be super interesting
02:33 - to you go to the next
02:36 - slide so basically we're going to go
02:38 - through this evening a set of best
02:39 - practices that we've gathered from
02:41 - successful hour of code Educators who
02:43 - we've interacted with throughout the
02:45 - past two or three years um and share
02:47 - with you what we've learned what are
02:48 - these teachers doing that makes hour of
02:50 - code work in their classroom after we
02:52 - share what we've learned we're going to
02:54 - have about 20 or 30 minutes for you to
02:56 - ask us questions and to get the help and
02:57 - support you need to be successful when
02:59 - we get to the question portion of the
03:01 - meeting I'll explain to you how to ask
03:03 - how to ask questions um but during the
03:06 - whole beginning as I mentioned please do
03:08 - feel free to use that chat icon on your
03:10 - side um and we will address questions as
03:12 - we go I heard a little
03:15 - Echo no you heard a siren outside our
03:18 - windows so I heard a siren outside the
03:20 - window the hour of code is on fire
03:22 - people and the fire
03:24 - department all right so I'm gonna hand
03:25 - it over to Laura and Alice um and I will
03:27 - go on mute and um close my webcam also
03:30 - just to say bandwidth ladies if you need
03:31 - me Hing me thank you great well let's
03:35 - get let's Dive Right In and get started
03:37 - I'm Alice and U we're going to go
03:40 - through how to teach the hour of code
03:41 - and a lot of your questions about how to
03:42 - make it successful at this point we've
03:45 - had over 100 million sorry students
03:49 - what's more than that well that's that's
03:51 - out of date
03:53 - um we need to update our slides there's
03:55 - more every day um we've had over a 100
03:57 - million students across the globe um who
04:00 - have done the hour of code and been
04:01 - exposed to computer science um and right
04:04 - now we have about aund and almost
04:06 - 110,000 Educators who have signed up to
04:09 - organize a hour of code with their
04:11 - classrooms this year so we're really
04:12 - excited about the scope of this um it's
04:15 - really important because for a lot of
04:16 - these students this is their first
04:18 - chance ever seen uh computer science
04:20 - they have no idea what it is um or it's
04:23 - you know an opportunity to do something
04:26 - that they don't normally get to do in
04:27 - their school and so that's something
04:29 - that we really hope with the hour of
04:30 - code it gives them a chance to see what
04:32 - it's
04:33 - about there we go so what we're going to
04:35 - do is we're going to run through the six
04:36 - steps of teaching hour of code um we're
04:38 - going to talk about how you can plan how
04:40 - you can promote your hour of code within
04:41 - your school and outside your school how
04:43 - to prepare for the hour of code and when
04:45 - we do that we're going to go through um
04:47 - how to choose a tutorial how to make
04:48 - sure it's the right tutorial for your
04:49 - class what you need in terms of
04:51 - classroom supplies to make the hour of
04:52 - code successful um then we're going to
04:55 - walk through what you should actually do
04:56 - on the day of the hour of code starting
04:57 - by inspiring your students with video
05:00 - and a quick uh and we'll talk about how
05:01 - to do that um then we'll show you what's
05:03 - going to happen when they're coding and
05:04 - finally um celebrating because you've
05:06 - done it and uh hopefully we'll get all
05:08 - through all of that in the next 20 to 30
05:10 - minutes and then leave lots of time for
05:12 - your questions afterward um so to kick
05:14 - it off we've got Lura to tell us how to
05:16 - plan our hour of code thank you Alice uh
05:18 - so the first thing to do is think about
05:21 - planning the hour of code is make sure
05:22 - you sign up your event on the
05:24 - hourofcode.com so not only when sign up
05:27 - your event you will be eligible to
05:29 - receive
05:30 - um cool all organizer prizes uh but you
05:33 - also will be added to a map so everyone
05:36 - can see and find you doing the hour of
05:38 - code after you signed up your event you
05:41 - want to start envisioning the experience
05:43 - you want your students to have start to
05:44 - finish you are you doing this in the
05:46 - computer lab are you doing it in the
05:48 - cafeteria are they doing it in groups or
05:50 - are they doing it one on one to one um
05:53 - and and that's uh then the next way to
05:55 - start your hour code after you decide
05:58 - what you want to do tell other teachers
06:00 - to get involved so we have a ton of
06:03 - resources at uh our code.com resources
06:07 - where you can download posters and
06:09 - social media blurs and stats that you
06:11 - can share but also encourage other
06:13 - teachers at your school to do
06:16 - it and you can also encourage uh your
06:20 - whole District to do it so we've heard
06:22 - from so many teachers all over the
06:24 - country that they've been able to sign
06:26 - up their whole District to participate
06:29 - that's especially cool if you're a
06:30 - computer science teacher say and there
06:32 - are a lot of teachers at your school who
06:33 - aren't computer science teachers they
06:34 - might be afraid to do it or afraid to
06:35 - try it and so you know helping other
06:38 - teachers at your school get started um
06:40 - can be a great thing to do and if
06:41 - there's a computer science program at
06:43 - your school with computer science
06:45 - students have them recruit other
06:46 - students to get involved and learn that
06:48 - week too and they can be the experts
06:50 - there uh getting everybody on on board
06:52 - and
06:54 - comfortable okay so at this point you've
06:57 - got your you've got your class or your
07:00 - school everybody's signed up you're
07:01 - ready to go you're in the thing how do
07:03 - you actually prepare for the hour of
07:04 - code and what do you need to do to get
07:06 - ready so let's walk through that the
07:07 - first thing you need to do is pick a
07:09 - tutorial and what I'm going to do here
07:10 - is I'm going to share my screen um and
07:13 - let me go right here share
07:18 - screen uh
07:21 - share okay uh so hopefully this is
07:24 - Melissa's switching over to me so you
07:26 - can see this great um so let Chrome okay
07:30 - so let's look at so here is um the place
07:33 - to go this is linked from hour of code
07:34 - if you click try it it's linked on the
07:36 - main page of code.org if you click try
07:37 - it um or you can just write down the URL
07:40 - here code.org learn um and if you look
07:42 - here what you'll see is all of the
07:44 - tutorials um that we' picked for this
07:46 - year at the top are our two feature
07:48 - tutorials for the year um and these are
07:50 - ones that we just developed for this
07:52 - year this is particularly useful if you
07:53 - did the hour of code last year or if
07:55 - your students did the hour of code last
07:57 - year with another class neither of these
07:58 - tutorials have done yet so you'll know
08:00 - that all the students are seen them for
08:01 - the first time we have two tutorials
08:03 - here one is a Minecraft tutorial the
08:05 - other is a Star Wars tutorial and I'm
08:06 - going to go into those in more depth in
08:08 - a minute um but before I do that a lot
08:11 - of you have been asking about
08:12 - kindergarteners and young kids both of
08:14 - these tutorials are designed for kids
08:16 - ages uh we say roughly six plus um but
08:20 - they should be able to read a little bit
08:22 - um I have tried it we've tested it with
08:24 - kids who were sort of early readers and
08:26 - not you know not strong readers yet and
08:28 - they can kind of get through it on their
08:30 - own if you're if you have a question you
08:31 - know your kids's best so you can try
08:34 - just trying out the tutorial and see if
08:35 - you think it's the right age for them um
08:37 - but if you do have younger kids if you
08:39 - have kindergarteners pre-readers I'd
08:41 - recommend looking a little bit lower
08:42 - here um we have these other categories
08:45 - um of tutorials so under tutorials for
08:48 - beginners if I click this right arrow
08:50 - you'll see some other tutorials that are
08:51 - really designed for beginners and for
08:53 - each of these you can see what um you
08:56 - can see what ages we recommend them for
08:57 - so for example this Tinker one is PES 5
09:00 - through 133 and you can also see what
09:01 - devices it's going to run on so this one
09:03 - runs on Modern web browsers if you look
09:05 - at uh the tutorials that we've created
09:08 - the Minecraft one um and the Star Wars
09:12 - one and some other ones we had last year
09:13 - um those will all run on any device you
09:15 - have on a Mac on a PC on any browser on
09:19 - Chrome on Safari they'll run on iPads
09:21 - they'll run on iPhones they'll run on
09:23 - Android devices Windows devices you name
09:25 - it um some of these other tutorials uh
09:28 - they do have specific
09:29 - U things they're looking for this is
09:31 - scratch it's a fantastic tutorial it's
09:33 - for ages eight plus um but because
09:35 - there's been a bunch of questions about
09:36 - pre-readers I'm going to go to um a
09:39 - couple of our pre-reader ones um where
09:42 - is
09:43 - the what was our top recommended one for
09:45 - pre-readers you have it uh the fos is a
09:48 - great one uh for pre-readers it's under
09:52 - the apps and devices or I'm sorry under
09:55 - tutorials this is looks like we're
09:57 - Frozen apps
09:59 - screen is frozen up there yeah this
10:01 - one's great for pre-readers um so oh my
10:05 - okay so um this was under tutorial apps
10:07 - for phones and tablets um it's called
10:09 - the Foos and it says pre-readers welcome
10:11 - we've called it out in the heading
10:13 - because it's really great for
10:14 - pre-readers um so if you are one of the
10:16 - people who been asking us about you know
10:17 - I've got younger kids pre-readers this
10:19 - would be one that I would recommend
10:21 - trying and the great part about the food
10:23 - is they've uh recently launched a web
10:25 - browser version of this so we actually
10:27 - will be adding it up uh to the beginners
10:30 - uh category so you'll actually don't
10:32 - need uh phones or tablets to do this one
10:34 - at all and it's excellent yeah it's
10:36 - really awesome uh so let me the other
10:40 - questions I had were you know do I need
10:42 - to have experience you know coding you
10:45 - don't need any experience coding you can
10:46 - go into this without any experience but
10:48 - I'm just going to show you what they
10:49 - look like um so I'll start with the
10:50 - Minecraft one and the Star Wars one so
10:53 - if uh let me go to my link here um so
10:57 - when you click on the Minecraft one it
10:58 - opens up this page page um at the top
11:00 - you've got your Minecraft tutorial um
11:02 - and we've created short URLs for all of
11:04 - these so if you just want to write them
11:05 - on the board for your kids to type in um
11:07 - code.org MC will take you to the
11:10 - Minecraft tutorial you can also of
11:12 - course bookmark that on the pages for
11:13 - them to make it even easier especially
11:15 - if you have young kids uh below it we've
11:17 - also linked these inspirational videos
11:20 - and I'm going to talk more about that
11:21 - later but that's a great way to kick off
11:22 - your classes with one of the
11:23 - inspirational videos then once you click
11:25 - try now it will launch you right into
11:27 - the Minecraft tutorial and at this point
11:29 - point it's self-driven these are
11:31 - designed so that you don't need to be um
11:34 - leading the whole class through it the
11:36 - class can lead themselves through it so
11:38 - as a student I come in I can pick
11:39 - whether I want to be Alex or Steve um
11:42 - I'm gonna pick Alex because I think she
11:44 - is cool and has a ponytails let's select
11:46 - Alex um and it'll walk through each of
11:48 - the instructions so add a second move
11:50 - forward command to reach the sheet um
11:52 - and here I can see and then it'll tell
11:54 - me I need to hit run to try my program
11:57 - um I'm going to go ahead and add that
11:58 - move forward command
12:00 - here right here and the part I skipped
12:02 - here was was also an instructional video
12:04 - that played um I don't want to play that
12:05 - over the blue jeans because it doesn't
12:07 - work well over blue jeans but um if
12:10 - you're if you want to try out the
12:11 - tutorial yourself you'll see that
12:12 - there's an instructional video where um
12:14 - in this case Yen who is the lead
12:16 - developer of Minecraft will walk the
12:18 - students through exactly how to do this
12:19 - and show them what they're doing so just
12:21 - to get them started um I click run and I
12:25 - beat that level and move on to the next
12:26 - one and it builds up very very slowly um
12:29 - deliberately so we introduce one concept
12:30 - at a time that first level all we're
12:32 - doing is introducing how to use the UI
12:35 - and then as I go further it'll introduce
12:36 - more Concepts like now I'm learning that
12:38 - I can um use this destroy block to chop
12:41 - down the tree later we'll teach loops
12:43 - and if statements and a few other
12:44 - Concepts Alice what's a UI oh user
12:48 - interface um so yes we will for us left
12:51 - Tex Sal out there um and and um and as
12:55 - you look at it you know one of the other
12:56 - things we do is we try to if the kids
12:58 - don't get it um there are these hints
13:00 - that will help them out so you know here
13:02 - I did not get it I can click C hint and
13:04 - it'll show me that I might want to try
13:07 - using the destroy block um block so
13:11 - that's something that you know you can
13:12 - you can just let your kids go through
13:14 - this they will do it on their own if
13:16 - they have any questions we encourage
13:17 - them to do something called try three uh
13:19 - sorry ask ask three than me um which is
13:22 - basically ask a friend and that's great
13:24 - for a couple reasons one um it really
13:27 - you know as you all know because your
13:28 - teachers but asking somebody else not
13:30 - only um you know helps me but also helps
13:32 - that student because they have to
13:33 - explain it to me um we also encourage
13:35 - pair programming and that's really great
13:37 - um we found it also helps uh girls be
13:39 - more interested in computer science when
13:41 - they're working with other girls or
13:42 - working with other boys either either
13:44 - one um and so prepare programing you put
13:47 - two people at a computer together and
13:48 - that also gives them somebody else that
13:50 - they can work with and if they get stuck
13:52 - they can ask each other they can ask the
13:53 - person next to them um and that's all a
13:55 - fantastic way to to help them through
13:57 - these tutorials the Minecraft tutorial
13:59 - if you've done our tutorials before is
14:01 - similar to The Angry Birds tutorial the
14:03 - original hour of code tutorial we
14:05 - produced in terms of the kinds of
14:06 - concept it's teaches so at first it's
14:08 - going to teach me how to take a concept
14:10 - like how do I get over to that tree and
14:12 - break it down into a series of steps or
14:14 - um as we go further you know I learn how
14:17 - to build a house um and I I learn how
14:21 - you know in this case the level I just
14:23 - loaded is the is the level for chopping
14:25 - down trees so I start to learn how would
14:27 - I you know walk over to one tree chop it
14:30 - down turn left walk over to another tree
14:32 - and chop it down and how do I um how do
14:34 - I do all of those steps together and how
14:35 - do I put those in sequence and then we
14:37 - teach Loops um and the students learn
14:39 - how to use a loop in a computer to be
14:41 - able to let the computer do many things
14:42 - over and over again um and they use that
14:44 - to do you know big things like build an
14:46 - entire house um and then they learn
14:48 - about if statements at the end it's not
14:51 - important that you're finished students
14:52 - finish the tutorial um and I usually
14:54 - tell them that up front um because
14:56 - sometimes they feel like oh I really
14:57 - have to get to the end they don't it's
14:59 - totally fine um if your students go at
15:01 - different Paces so some students can zip
15:03 - through to the end and if they do
15:05 - there's a free play level at the end um
15:07 - and they can just keep free playing for
15:09 - as long as they want or um I'm G to skip
15:11 - the video right now this is the free
15:13 - play level an extra big level where it's
15:15 - like nine times the size and they can go
15:17 - everywhere and build stuff um or they
15:20 - can go on if you want to let them do a
15:21 - different tutorial they can start
15:22 - another tutorial afterwards and for
15:24 - students who don't finish that's also
15:26 - completely fine so you know having
15:28 - students who get to level seven or level
15:29 - six um that's great and at any point
15:32 - when you're done with your hour they can
15:34 - just go ahead and click straight to I'm
15:35 - finished with my hour of code um and you
15:37 - can do that whether or not you get to
15:39 - the end um and they can still get their
15:40 - certificate and we'll talk a little bit
15:42 - more about um certificates in a minute
15:44 - so um I also want to show you the Star
15:47 - Wars tutorial so uh we have a new
15:49 - tutorial this year for Star Wars and
15:51 - there actually two versions of this
15:52 - tutorial we have a blocks version and a
15:54 - JavaScript version the difficulty of
15:57 - them is almost the same the big
15:59 - difference is you type in the JavaScript
16:00 - version so if you have a group of kids
16:02 - who um are uh can't type yet you should
16:06 - definitely do the blocks version if you
16:09 - have a group of kids who can type and
16:11 - are a little older and maybe feel cooler
16:14 - if they're typing you know like it's
16:16 - it's a real code and it's exciting to
16:17 - type the JavaScript one is great because
16:19 - it gives them the flexibility to use
16:21 - blocks if they're not super comfortable
16:23 - with typing or if you have a mixed class
16:24 - where some want to use blocks and some
16:25 - want to type um but it also gives them
16:28 - the flexibility to turn turn into um to
16:30 - switch over to the to the typing mode so
16:32 - here are the um this is what the block
16:35 - version looks like again so you know
16:37 - here I am on bb8 um and it's very the
16:40 - beginning is very similar I'm you know
16:41 - moving down and around I'm gathering
16:43 - these things using these blocks that are
16:45 - um the block version and then this is
16:48 - the uh JavaScript version um and again
16:51 - it uses blocks that I can drag but
16:54 - instead of being simple English where it
16:56 - says you know move space right it's
16:57 - actually the real Java script command so
17:00 - move right one word with the parentheses
17:02 - and the semicolon at the end and at any
17:04 - point the students can switch into text
17:07 - mode and type something like move
17:12 - left um in you know typing so it feels
17:15 - you know a little bit more like real
17:16 - JavaScript here uh in this tutorial we
17:20 - don't teach we teach a different set of
17:21 - Concepts than in the Minecraft tutorial
17:24 - we instead of teaching loops and if
17:26 - statements we focus on events and you
17:28 - can play through it it's fun they make
17:29 - their own game at the end um and we've
17:32 - had you know my uh my son made a game
17:34 - where there were all these you know
17:36 - Storm Troopers coming after him and then
17:38 - you tried to get these like flying
17:40 - winged things called minox and um and
17:43 - the more you got the more appeared and
17:45 - it's super fun and they can create that
17:47 - um because these tutorials teach
17:49 - different concepts it's also completely
17:50 - fine if a student finishes early to have
17:52 - them do both tutorials like they're
17:53 - designed to be compliments of each other
17:55 - or they can help other students or they
17:57 - can help other students which is also
17:58 - great
17:59 - so um I think that was the whole demo
18:02 - we're going to do right now you can
18:03 - definitely try these out on your own um
18:04 - I just wanted to do a quick demo here so
18:06 - let's go back to our
18:09 - slides oh um okay I need to exit here
18:13 - screen sharing stop screen
18:17 - sharing and we're back to the
18:20 - slides we're doing it okay so once
18:23 - you've picked your tutorial um and
18:25 - you've said you know just try it out see
18:27 - if it seems age appropriate for your kid
18:28 - kids um the next thing to do is try it
18:31 - out on your device you know it should
18:35 - just work but you just want to make sure
18:37 - that you know I don't you know if you if
18:39 - you have iPads in your room if you have
18:40 - Android tablets in your room you want to
18:42 - make sure that the tutorial you picked
18:44 - is compatible with the device you've
18:45 - picked and they should all be listed up
18:47 - front um but for example if you looked
18:49 - at the JavaScript tutorial I just showed
18:50 - you because it involves some typing it
18:52 - wouldn't work on a tablet you would want
18:53 - to use the blocks version if you were on
18:55 - a tablet um it's good to test it out in
18:58 - advance yeah it's good to try it out
19:00 - before you have a whole classroom with
19:01 - 30 students trying it out better to try
19:03 - it out when it's just you um if you um
19:07 - if you don't have enough devices you can
19:08 - use pair programming although I prefer
19:10 - using it even if you do have enough
19:11 - devices I think you know it's just a lot
19:13 - more fun but um definitely if you don't
19:15 - have enough devices you should do it um
19:17 - and if you have low bandwidth you might
19:19 - want to download all of the videos up
19:21 - front and we've got some instructions
19:22 - for how to do that another thing that
19:24 - you can do in advance print out the um
19:27 - the certificates for your class um you
19:29 - can also you know give it to them after
19:31 - the class but um if you go to there's a
19:34 - link in the howto guide where it shows
19:36 - you a link to print out all the
19:37 - certificates and what I've done in the
19:39 - past is just enter all of the students
19:40 - names up front there's a sort of copy
19:42 - and paste all your student names in
19:44 - it'll generate all the certificates for
19:45 - everyone in your class to say they've
19:46 - done an hour of code you can print them
19:48 - all out in advance and then when the
19:49 - class is over you can hand them all
19:50 - their certificates um and the kids
19:52 - really love taking them home and then
19:54 - also their parents can see that the you
19:56 - know sort of an achievement that they
19:57 - did that hour of code um I've also seen
19:59 - teachers hang them up in the classroom
20:01 - as another way to you know celebrate it
20:03 - Cate
20:06 - yeah so now we're ready to actually do
20:08 - the hour of code um and the first thing
20:11 - you want to do when you kick off the
20:12 - hour of code um is just tell the
20:14 - students what they're doing that day um
20:15 - and this doesn't take very long most of
20:17 - it's just putting them in front of the
20:18 - computer and letting them do the hour of
20:19 - code um but what I like to do is you
20:22 - know just five minutes at the beginning
20:24 - um if younger kids gather them on the
20:26 - rug if their older kids leave them in
20:27 - their you know in their seats
20:29 - um and tell them a little bit about what
20:30 - computer science is and play a video to
20:32 - inspire them so kids often have this
20:35 - misperception that computer science is
20:38 - you know something that like a boring
20:41 - old guy does in their basement yeah
20:44 - totally you got it um and they don't see
20:47 - it as something that they can do
20:48 - especially if they're a girl or if
20:50 - they're you know African-American Or
20:52 - Hispanic it just doesn't feel like
20:54 - something they would do or it doesn't
20:55 - feel like it applies to their life and
20:57 - today it's something where you know if
20:59 - you make a movie like Anna and Elsa
21:01 - right you use computer science to make
21:02 - the movie you know we use computer
21:04 - science in space in medicine in
21:06 - agriculture in all every basically every
21:09 - field you go into um there ways to
21:11 - connect it to computer science and
21:13 - helping them see that is part of the
21:15 - reason we do the hour of code so they
21:17 - see why hour you know coding is
21:19 - interesting um and so we've created a
21:21 - bunch of videos if you don't know how to
21:22 - like if you don't know much about
21:23 - computer science yourself uh it could be
21:25 - hard to explain all of this so we've
21:26 - created a bunch of videos to make it
21:27 - easy um there are these are all on
21:31 - code.org educate Inspire and um you can
21:35 - just pick any one of these um we the
21:37 - first one on the list if your students
21:38 - have done this before is brand new for
21:40 - this year so if you want one that's
21:41 - brand new they haven't seen before um in
21:43 - particular is about women and girls
21:46 - getting women into computer science so
21:48 - um you know to inspire the girls in your
21:49 - class to see that something that girls
21:51 - can do um and then there's some the rest
21:53 - of these are things that are for
21:54 - everybody um you know and the last one
21:56 - there that we have there is um Barack
21:58 - Obama encouraging the kids to do
21:59 - computer science which can be fun so um
22:02 - you play the video um and then you can
22:05 - do something inspiring or you don't know
22:07 - much about computer science and you want
22:08 - someone to come to your class and help
22:09 - Inspire the class we have thousands of
22:12 - volunteers um who work at tech companies
22:15 - or computer science university students
22:18 - um and they are happy to come to your
22:21 - class and help out with the hour of code
22:23 - um we uh they're all listed here we have
22:26 - this page it's linked on the howto page
22:28 - on the code.org if you want to reach out
22:31 - to one of these people um it's up to you
22:34 - to do the screening that your school
22:35 - requires we have not bedded any of these
22:37 - people um they have just signed up
22:39 - volunteering and saying that they you
22:41 - know they they have links to their
22:42 - Facebook profiles or their LinkedIn
22:44 - profiles um you know they work at tech
22:46 - companies we have not vetted any of that
22:48 - um but I assume most of them are you
22:50 - know real tech people that you could
22:52 - work with um you will need a little time
22:54 - to coordinate with them and most of them
22:56 - have said they would volunteer for one
22:58 - uh hour of code so if you want to reach
23:00 - out to one of these people I'd really
23:01 - encourage you to do it soon so that you
23:02 - can find somebody who's near you um and
23:05 - you can get it set up with enough time
23:06 - to get going before your class starts
23:08 - and even if there isn't somebody near
23:10 - you a lot of them um because you know a
23:12 - lot are based in Seattle because of
23:14 - Microsoft or in the Bay Area because of
23:17 - all the tech startups uh a lot of them
23:19 - will be willing to Skype into the
23:20 - classroom or video chat into the
23:22 - classroom uh to inspire your students as
23:25 - well yeah and that might be easier to
23:26 - set up too because you don't have to go
23:27 - through any like
23:28 - background checks that your school
23:30 - requires or anything else because you
23:31 - could just Skype into them um and they
23:33 - can you know what I would do if you if
23:35 - you connect with one those people is
23:35 - just let them talk for like five to 10
23:37 - minutes maybe answer some questions from
23:38 - the students about what computer science
23:40 - is and what they do with computer
23:41 - science and then you let your kids code
23:44 - and we already showed that part just put
23:45 - them in front of the computers let them
23:47 - go to the right tutorial and um that
23:49 - should you know you can do it anywhere
23:51 - from 30 minutes if that's what you've
23:53 - got to an hour and they're designed to
23:55 - be flexible in terms of how long it
23:56 - takes and um while they're doing that
23:59 - you know you can have them help each
24:01 - other out you can do it in front of the
24:03 - room you can do it in their own classes
24:05 - um and basically your job is just to be
24:07 - the guide on the side so help them if
24:08 - they have
24:10 - questions um this is a picture this is a
24:13 - way to do pair programming I actually
24:15 - prefer it when you just have one
24:17 - computer and two students actually
24:18 - sharing the same computer I find that
24:20 - that just forces them to talk more if
24:22 - they're on their own computers they may
24:23 - sort of diverge in terms of what they're
24:25 - working on and we have a great video
24:27 - linked from the how to page on what pair
24:29 - programming actually looks like that we
24:32 - made
24:34 - yeah um there's also a number of unplugg
24:36 - lessons so if you don't have computers
24:39 - for your classroom um or your kids are
24:42 - just you know younger um it can be more
24:44 - fun to get them up walking around
24:46 - running around than putting them in
24:47 - front of computers I've done the unplugg
24:49 - lessons with three-year olds
24:51 - four-year-olds 5year olds um I really I
24:55 - actually I personally like them I like
24:57 - for they really young kids yeah um for
24:59 - the older kids I've also I've done them
25:01 - with third graders and they're fun even
25:02 - with third graders um but if you do have
25:05 - a a young class and you know your class
25:07 - is not the type who you know would sit
25:09 - and read a book for a long time they
25:10 - like want to get up and run um this is a
25:12 - really fun way to do a computer science
25:14 - activi it's interactive and they can
25:15 - work with each other there's a whole
25:17 - series of these on the list of tutorials
25:19 - and you can find one that's great for
25:20 - your
25:23 - class and take pictures after
25:27 - everybody's excitement in the moment uh
25:30 - and also you can invite uh politicians
25:33 - uh local tech industry people all to
25:35 - come and try the hour of code with you
25:37 - yeah that's really the politicians a lot
25:39 - of them love the opportunity to do this
25:42 - this is a great opportunity for them um
25:45 - and it's also really cool for your
25:46 - school to get to see like the governor
25:48 - or the mayor or you know some local
25:51 - politician coming and joining them for
25:53 - this or you can even have them teach the
25:55 - principal how to code yeah nice
25:58 - um so after they do their hour of code
26:01 - you want to celebrate their big
26:02 - accomplishment and achievement so like
26:04 - Alice said you can go to code.org
26:07 - certificates and prepopulate all your
26:10 - students names uh that way you can give
26:12 - them uh certificates at the end and we
26:15 - see these pictures all come in through
26:17 - our social media uh throughout the week
26:19 - and we love love love seeing them um our
26:21 - developers who have worked so hard on
26:23 - the tutorials love to see how excited
26:26 - and happy students are uh doing
26:32 - that these are just more pictures of
26:34 - student of uh that have been shared with
26:36 - us and if you U hashtag it hour of code
26:39 - and do code.org we're guaranteed to see
26:43 - it we've also seen teachers build a wall
26:45 - of Honor with all the
26:53 - certificates so most importantly as
26:56 - you're doing the hour of code show us
26:57 - your hour code share us what you're
26:59 - doing uh your stories maybe you have
27:02 - something new that we haven't talked
27:03 - about today we want to know about it so
27:05 - we can tell teachers next year um so
27:08 - just hasht it hourofcode code.org it's
27:11 - also really helps encourage other
27:12 - teachers at your school when they see
27:13 - you do it um it's a great you know some
27:16 - people who might not thought they could
27:17 - try it might try it because you did it
27:19 - and it worked with their class your
27:24 - class so that's it six easy steps yeah
27:27 - we're right on time we said we f Mission
27:28 - what time is it 25 minutes um so lots of
27:31 - time for your
27:33 - questions you guys did great you blasted
27:35 - through it and as a matter of fact I
27:36 - think one of the most common questions I
27:38 - got was is this session being recorded
27:41 - yes it is ladies and gentlemen if you
27:43 - registered for the event you will get a
27:45 - link to this recording so don't panic if
27:47 - you didn't catch everything that Alice
27:48 - and Laura covered uh in that lightning
27:50 - round so much great information ladies
27:52 - thank you so much um the other thing
27:54 - that we're going to do after the event
27:56 - is over um when we email you that link
27:58 - to the recording we're also going to
27:59 - email you a link to these slides and
28:01 - these best practices so don't feel like
28:03 - you need to take notes on everything
28:05 - apologize should just said that in
28:07 - advance um so we did have a request for
28:10 - a demo um and then there's a couple
28:12 - other questions so I'll tell you what we
28:14 - would like demoed and then you guys can
28:15 - answer a few other quick ones in the
28:16 - meantime um some folks were asking if
28:19 - they want to track student progress um
28:22 - for hour of code what do they need to do
28:25 - um Kate and I were talking about um how
28:28 - it needs to be a code datw work tutorial
28:29 - and you would need to create a code
28:30 - Studio account is that something that we
28:32 - could show on the screen maybe for folks
28:34 - who are struggling yeah absolutely
28:36 - definitely I'm gonna start sharing that
28:38 - why don't you ask another question and
28:39 - Laura will answer it while I get that
28:40 - set up sure so one of the first
28:42 - questions that we got was you know how
28:44 - is a teacher how can a teacher best
28:46 - decide which tutorial to use in their
28:48 - classroom um are some more appropriate
28:50 - for other for ages than others um what
28:53 - if some students have more experience
28:54 - coding than others what what do we
28:56 - recommend for teachers as they're trying
28:57 - to figure figure out which tutorial is
28:59 - for them so definitely it comes down uh
29:02 - to to age uh and experience if your
29:05 - students um aren't readers you
29:08 - definitely want to do something like
29:09 - Foos or Hopscotch or codable or are they
29:12 - offline are they unplugged unug we have
29:14 - mentioned that earlier yeah the
29:15 - unplugged are great yeah um and then
29:18 - there's also if your students are more
29:20 - in high school and want to feel more
29:22 - adult like they're really writing code
29:23 - our Star Wars tutorial is great because
29:25 - they can do the JavaScript version of it
29:27 - and we have a whole series of JavaScript
29:29 - tutorials from code HS code academy Con
29:32 - Academy those are all better for uh
29:35 - older students or more advanced students
29:38 - uh the beginner tutorials are pretty
29:40 - much great for anybody to start I mean
29:42 - my mom did The Angry Birds tutorial and
29:44 - loved it yeah she's like
29:48 - 60 um yeah and you know for older
29:51 - students um I think KH Academy has got a
29:54 - great tutorial if you're in high school
29:55 - and you're you know want to do less
29:57 - something a little more more advanced um
29:59 - why don't we we'll come back to that
30:00 - again let's go I've got this up on the
30:02 - screen sharing so I don't want people to
30:03 - just stare at my screen um without
30:05 - having somebody talking so um let me
30:07 - talk a little bit about the question
30:09 - about student accounts in progress so um
30:11 - the first thing to mention is that
30:14 - we okay so here I'm GNA show this up
30:16 - here um so we've designed it so that you
30:18 - don't need to create any um you don't
30:22 - need to create an account the students
30:24 - don't need to create an account you can
30:26 - monitor their progress and to see what
30:28 - they're up to um without any accounts
30:30 - just by walking around the room and so
30:32 - if you look up here I'm going to go so
30:34 - you can see just at a glance at the very
30:36 - top of the screen you can see I'm on
30:37 - puzzle one um and we actually put that
30:39 - on the top of the screen deliberately so
30:41 - that when you're just walking around
30:43 - you're sort of looking over the kids
30:44 - heads you can easily see where every
30:46 - student is um in the class so let me I'm
30:50 - just gonna finish this one level I'm G
30:52 - to go move right again and hit run go P
30:56 - okay I did it I moved on to puzzle two
31:01 - um and what you see here is I've got a
31:02 - Green Dot right here showing that I
31:05 - finished level one um and you see the
31:07 - big number two so I can tell that I'm on
31:08 - puzzle two um this is really helpful as
31:10 - you walk around the room because I can
31:12 - see at a glance you know this kid's on
31:14 - puzzle two this student's on puzzle
31:16 - seven I can sort of see who's falling
31:18 - behind who's ahead um I don't have to
31:20 - log in I don't have to go to any Dash
31:22 - boards I don't have to look at anything
31:23 - live real time in the room as you're
31:25 - doing it if you see a student who's
31:26 - really struggling or falling behind you
31:28 - might ask another student to help them
31:30 - or you might help them um try to catch
31:31 - up a little bit um or just see you know
31:34 - why they're stuck the other thing you
31:35 - can see is if a student skips and this
31:37 - happens you guys all have students you
31:39 - know what this looks like so this kid
31:41 - saw that his friend was on level seven
31:43 - and level seven looked like a lot of fun
31:46 - um and so he just decided to skip right
31:48 - straight to level seven so now when I
31:50 - look over this kid's shoulder I see that
31:52 - they finished level one because it's
31:53 - green there was a whole pile of white
31:55 - dots that they did not do and they went
31:57 - right to level seven um and so that also
32:01 - gives me like you know indication of
32:02 - what's going on and I can see all that
32:04 - progress so that's actually what I
32:06 - recommend doing real time in the
32:07 - classroom um for just the hour of code
32:09 - um there's no reason to set up an
32:11 - account there's no reason to set up
32:12 - student accounts um this just makes it
32:14 - really easy to just you just put the
32:16 - kids on the URL and watch it and it's
32:18 - great now if you do want to go a little
32:21 - further if you're thinking about more
32:22 - classes or if you just want to have a
32:23 - record for later to look at to see what
32:25 - the students do you can create an and to
32:28 - do that what you want to do um is in
32:30 - this upper right if I wasn't logged in
32:33 - um which I just did so I'm G to sign out
32:35 - again for a minute just so you can see
32:36 - this um so when you come to our um site
32:40 - on any of the pages you'll see the
32:41 - signin button on the top right um so go
32:43 - ahead and click that and if you can
32:46 - either um sign in or if you haven't
32:48 - signed up yet you can click sign up to
32:50 - create an account um I actually have an
32:52 - account so I'm going to go ahead and
32:53 - enter it
32:56 - here I have have many many accounts this
32:58 - is my teacher account um and this op
33:01 - stuff you won't see because that's just
33:03 - because I'm uh I work here so I see that
33:05 - stuff um so over here on teacher
33:08 - homepage um on your teacher homepage
33:10 - which is where you'll go straight when
33:11 - you log it's the first place you're
33:12 - going to see when you log in on the top
33:14 - left there's a student accounts and
33:15 - progress box uh and if I click there um
33:19 - what I can do is I can set up a section
33:21 - um so let's set up a new section um
33:24 - let's call it um period one I already
33:27 - have period one on here um what should I
33:28 - call it
33:29 - Laura coding is fun coding is
33:33 - fun if you have multiple classes you
33:35 - could put it in here um you can choose a
33:37 - login type I um for um for most students
33:42 - for younger students I definitely like
33:43 - either the word or picture login types
33:45 - you can do email but it's more
33:46 - complicated because they all have to put
33:47 - their emails in and then you have to you
33:49 - know send it and then there's no like
33:51 - it's just it's more complicated word
33:52 - will be the fastest easiest way to get
33:54 - in um so I have a bunch of third graders
33:57 - I can ch choose what course I want to
33:58 - assign it in this case what I want to do
34:00 - is I'm going to put them on the Star
34:01 - Wars thing that we just saw um and you
34:04 - could also use the same UI if you want
34:07 - to go on and teach um some of our we
34:09 - have 20 hour courses that are available
34:11 - for k35 so this is fun and you like it
34:13 - and you want to keep going um you can
34:14 - use the same UI to teach one of those
34:16 - courses um and I hit save and now I've
34:20 - got this um new class and I can click on
34:22 - it or click manage students and enter
34:23 - some students I'm gonna zip ahead you
34:25 - guys can um there's also a thing here so
34:28 - you can see it I'm just going to zip
34:29 - into one of the courses I already have
34:31 - set up so you can see this if I look at
34:33 - um period one which is a course I
34:35 - already set up oh wait that was a test
34:36 - course with nobody in it hold on let me
34:39 - find one where I actually have students
34:41 - in it um okay this is the problem with
34:45 - doing all my testing here um period
34:49 - three might have students bu progress no
34:53 - sorry um period two third times the
34:57 - charm
34:58 - oh yeah real progress okay um so here we
35:02 - can see um if you do have it set up and
35:05 - I were on a i on just uh one of the hour
35:08 - code tutorials what I could see later
35:10 - after the class if I wanted to come back
35:11 - and look at it is I could take a look at
35:13 - all of my students in the class and I
35:15 - could see which which stages they'd all
35:17 - done so I could see Owen finished all 15
35:20 - or sorry which levels Ryan finished all
35:22 - 15
35:23 - Orlando um got to level eight Tila got
35:27 - to level LEL six then skipped ahead to
35:29 - eight and nine and Aina did up to level
35:31 - seven so if you want to save this
35:33 - information or you just want to have it
35:34 - later um that is how you would go ahead
35:36 - and do that um but again real time in
35:39 - the classroom just to do an hour of code
35:41 - completely unnecessary I don't recommend
35:43 - it I've never when I do hour of code I
35:44 - don't use any of this I just have the
35:47 - kids go ahead and do it without logging
35:48 - in so that is that question and thanks
35:52 - for showing it Alice I think that really
35:53 - made it clear for folks to actually have
35:55 - the demo so thank you um so we got a lot
35:58 - of other questions coming up I think
35:59 - that's probably the last demo we'll have
36:01 - if you want to stop sharing your screen
36:03 - um so back to the question of how do you
36:04 - choose a tutorial we had a lot of
36:06 - questions about how do you know what's
36:07 - age appropriate um and then also devices
36:10 - how do you know whether something's
36:12 - going to work on an iPad or Chrome
36:14 - versus n Explorer what do we
36:16 - suggest so all of the tutorials have it
36:19 - listed yeah it all has it listed and
36:21 - then code.org tutorials uh we we make
36:24 - them work on iPads iPhones everything
36:27 - Windows there yeah yeah we work on all
36:30 - os's all web browsers yeah so if you're
36:33 - not sure use code.org tutorial uh but
36:36 - all the other tutorials do have what
36:38 - they're uh compatible with written in
36:41 - the description yeah Y and I would just
36:44 - add on a lot of those descriptions
36:45 - there's a little link that says for
36:47 - teachers and if you click on that you
36:49 - can often find a lesson plan or some
36:51 - description of what concepts are covered
36:53 - in the tutorial teaching suggestions and
36:56 - then also how to modify it for grade
36:57 - levels and ability levels I know all of
36:59 - our tutorials at code.org have that and
37:01 - a number of our partners do as well um
37:03 - so as an educator it's really tiny print
37:05 - but look for that um that's one of the
37:08 - reasons why we suggest spending just a
37:09 - little bit of time before your hour of
37:11 - code playing around and being smart
37:13 - about what tutorials you select um as
37:15 - opposed to having your kids go Hog Wild
37:17 - but that could also be fun so I'm not
37:20 - against that all right so another
37:22 - question I know Alice would love to
37:23 - answer this one we've gotten about five
37:25 - or six people ask us are we ready for
37:28 - the number of people who are going to be
37:29 - hitting our website on December
37:31 - 7th we've been working really really
37:34 - really hard on that we've been doing a
37:35 - bunch of scale testing um we uh we have
37:39 - an engineer from Google who's been
37:41 - helping us yeah um we and from and from
37:44 - Amazon they've been helping us so um we
37:46 - are we as far as we could tell based on
37:49 - our scale testing we are ready um and
37:52 - we're definitely excited about it the
37:54 - other thing we've done this year um if
37:55 - any of you are international I don't
37:57 - know if if you are um is to set up and
38:00 - this is getting tactical but we've set
38:02 - up a Content delivery network uh we're
38:05 - using the content delivery Network so
38:06 - that it's the tutorials are local to
38:09 - where you are so if you're in Australia
38:11 - you no longer have to hit the east coast
38:13 - of the United States to get your
38:15 - tutorial which should mean everything
38:16 - just runs a lot faster and a lot
38:18 - smoother um and everybody should have
38:19 - better response times around the world
38:21 - so uh yeah I hope we're
38:23 - ready as far as we can tell from all
38:26 - testing we are um we're ready not only
38:27 - we ready we're ready for 10 times more
38:30 - than we predict um so that way you know
38:33 - if we're underestimating we're still
38:36 - ready so uh there's a question as to
38:38 - whether these tutorials are available
38:39 - for students outside the classroom or
38:41 - they have to be done during the school
38:43 - day they're available all the time 247
38:47 - 365 days a week yeah yeah so even you
38:51 - know if they want to do it we've had a
38:52 - lot of students do that where they do
38:54 - the hour of code and they want to go try
38:55 - another tutorial later on their own and
38:57 - they can absolutely do that or they
38:58 - don't finish in class home finish it for
39:01 - kids who are fast workers and those ones
39:03 - that you can never keep up with with the
39:05 - rest of the class pick out two or three
39:08 - tutorials so they have something else to
39:10 - go on to do
39:14 - after I'm sorry I'm just answering
39:16 - questions as you are as well in the chat
39:18 - P um so Alice you mentioned that there
39:20 - was a free play level in Minecraft um
39:22 - can you talk to us about what that means
39:24 - and what that is yeah we actually
39:26 - designed that in um the last level of
39:31 - the last three of our tutorials um and
39:33 - that's designed so that the kids have
39:34 - more like the kids who finish early have
39:36 - something to do so in the Frozen
39:38 - tutorial they can keep making their own
39:39 - ice art in the Minecraft level what we
39:42 - do is we give you so all of the tutorial
39:44 - levels have been done in this sort of
39:45 - little square and on the last level we
39:48 - open it up so the square is nine times
39:49 - as big there's this whole space and
39:51 - they've learned Loops so they can build
39:53 - things that just keep going on and on
39:54 - and on and on and on um and we also give
39:57 - them new new materials new things that
39:59 - they can use and they can go do whatever
40:02 - they want and build it and keep
40:03 - exploring and you know making more
40:05 - things happen um which you know allows
40:07 - them to keep playing in that tutorial on
40:09 - the Star Wars tutorial we've done the
40:11 - same thing so on the last level
40:13 - basically we're teaching you how to make
40:14 - your own Star Wars game and so as you go
40:17 - along you learn oh I can make something
40:19 - happen when I hit the up key I can make
40:20 - sounds happen I can make something
40:22 - happen when I touch a certain guy like
40:24 - if I touch a stormtrooper I can make it
40:26 - lose points or I can make a gain points
40:28 - and so we teach you all these little
40:29 - building blocks along the way and then
40:31 - the last level is now you have all the
40:32 - building blocks go build your own game
40:35 - and again we give you new things that
40:36 - you haven't had before so we give you
40:38 - new sounds that you've never been able
40:39 - to use before and we give you new um new
40:43 - uh new blocks you can use new commands
40:45 - you can use um I saw one group of
40:47 - students um play with it for over an
40:50 - hour just on the last level um where all
40:52 - they were doing was for the last hour
40:54 - just you know playing games trying each
40:56 - other's games editing it doing more
40:58 - features on the games um and that's
41:00 - designed to be that way actually my son
41:02 - I had to stop him after two hours
41:03 - because it was dinner um I just told him
41:05 - he wasn't allowed to keep working on his
41:06 - game in Star Wars so yes yes you can uh
41:09 - you can definitely definitely keep
41:11 - playing on the last levels the idea that
41:14 - they can share the games with other
41:16 - students to play so it's not just on
41:18 - their computer then they you can have
41:19 - them all swapping around trying out
41:21 - everybody's game yeah I think if you let
41:24 - them do it they do it on their own but
41:25 - if you encourage it they will totally
41:26 - have fun with that
41:28 - yeah great so I thought it might be fun
41:30 - to try out the interactive feature I've
41:32 - got six folks who would like to actually
41:34 - ask you questions Laura and Alice um so
41:37 - there are a number of folks whose names
41:39 - I have um if you no longer have a
41:41 - question please do lower your hand um
41:43 - but I'll just go right down the line and
41:45 - Evelyn I saw that you have a question
41:46 - I'm going to go ahead and approve you
41:48 - him as well if you guys would like to
41:50 - unmute and um ask your question um and
41:53 - ladies I don't know what the question
41:55 - will be so this should be a fun
41:56 - experiment to see how it
41:59 - goes gone okay so we'll just give them a
42:03 - second hello I'm also approving
42:07 - you great so while we're waiting if if
42:10 - I've approved you now you can go ahead
42:11 - and unmute yourself and ask your
42:13 - question while we're waiting for that we
42:15 - got a lot of questions about um whether
42:17 - you had to start at the beginning and
42:18 - work your way all the way through for
42:20 - our tutorials or whether you could kind
42:22 - of bounce around and related to that if
42:24 - a student starts and wants to come back
42:26 - the next day or at home how does that
42:29 - work so if there's a few answers like
42:32 - that's like three questions I'm gonna
42:33 - answer them all um so first of all you
42:36 - can Skip and we do that on purpose we do
42:38 - that because sometimes if a kid is
42:39 - really stuck um I just encourage him to
42:42 - go to the next level and keep having fun
42:45 - um but I would encourage the kids not to
42:47 - skip unless they need to right so start
42:50 - off by just telling your kids to go
42:52 - through it in order most kids don't
42:53 - realize they can skip so they just keep
42:55 - going through it in order um but you'll
42:57 - see is if you're one of your students um
43:00 - you you know if you see one of your
43:01 - students who's really struggling just go
43:02 - ahead and help them skip ahead to the
43:04 - next level um that's true of our
43:06 - tutorials it's not true of all the
43:07 - tutorials so if you're in one of the
43:08 - other tutorials it might work
43:09 - differently um each tutorial has its own
43:11 - sort of progression way of doing that
43:13 - the second question was how do I save it
43:15 - to go back to it later so um because you
43:19 - can start anywhere um the easiest thing
43:21 - to do again is not make accounts don't
43:23 - log in if your student is on level seven
43:25 - when they're finish in class just go
43:28 - home and go right into level eight and
43:29 - keep going there's no reason they need
43:30 - to do one through seven again they can
43:32 - just start on level eight so there they
43:34 - don't need to save their particular
43:35 - progress they just start where they go
43:37 - if they get to the last level and
43:38 - they're building their own personalized
43:40 - thing right like they're building this
43:41 - really cool Minecraft thing or they're
43:42 - building a Star Wars game or anything
43:44 - like that they can save when they click
43:47 - finish a little dialogue will come up um
43:50 - with a link in it that they can save um
43:52 - and it also has a way for them to share
43:54 - that on Facebook or Twitter if your
43:56 - class allows that if they're at home
43:57 - maybe they'll do that if they're younger
43:59 - kids they're you know then obviously not
44:02 - um but um but yeah if they save if you
44:05 - just copy and paste that URL or write it
44:07 - down um then they can go get their own
44:09 - particular game back so they can keep
44:11 - working on their Star Wars game at home
44:13 - or share it with a friend and their
44:14 - friend can keep working on it so that's
44:15 - a lot of fun too so I think we're ready
44:17 - for questions I think we are we've got
44:19 - some folks on Deck so I'm sorry I don't
44:21 - know your name so um if you could just
44:24 - tell us your name where you're from ask
44:26 - your question you need to unmute your
44:28 - mic and for anyone else who would like
44:30 - to speak to our presenters tonight just
44:32 - click on the little hand icon and I'll
44:34 - get you queued up so let's start with
44:36 - our friend with the uh green scarf neck
44:39 - piece yes you my dear would you like to
44:42 - start yes this is Evelyn how are you
44:47 - hi well you know what it's been a hustle
44:50 - to get this on I had a Bor meeting at
44:52 - school I escaped the Bor meeting I drove
44:55 - home and I put you on my phone and I
44:58 - drove as fast as I could without getting
45:00 - into any accidents and I got home and
45:02 - I'm like yes I made it so I'm here
45:06 - excellent I am in New York wonderful
45:11 - okay so you know I'm in love with code I
45:13 - started using uh this program with my
45:16 - students and they love it they love it
45:19 - um the days were're up from school
45:21 - because it was a holiday I noticed that
45:24 - they were using it at home and now is
45:27 - been used as a motivator for them to
45:29 - complete some of the work so it is very
45:33 - popular and I'm getting everybody on
45:35 - school administrator they don't know
45:37 - what this is about but I'm like hello
45:39 - don't worry get you back I I call it
45:42 - come on let's
45:44 - Cod wonderful do you have a question for
45:47 - us yes you know I uh the kids always ask
45:51 - me because I'm also new I went to e 2015
45:54 - this year so that's when I get in love I
45:57 - got in love with this and I've been
45:58 - working with this um I've been working
46:00 - with students ages six through 10 11
46:05 - years old and they're also Spanish
46:07 - speaking most of them so it's great
46:09 - they're trying to use the language and
46:10 - you know collaborate uh with each other
46:13 - but uh my question is like what do I do
46:16 - when I finish I'm like I really don't
46:18 - know and that I don't know if this
46:19 - answer has been a question have been
46:21 - answered but this is something that I
46:22 - would like to you know I think they want
46:24 - to see an end and you know they they
46:27 - completed the program and they're like
46:29 - What's now I have a couple of them that
46:31 - are doing the studio the 20 hours and
46:33 - they're very excited but uh is there a
46:36 - way to answer that question yeah there
46:38 - lots of answers yeah um so if they're
46:40 - doing the hour of code um I recommend
46:43 - one of three things depending on the
46:44 - kids their age so either go help another
46:46 - student finish um you know your
46:48 - classroom best you're going to be the
46:49 - best one to judge whether that's the
46:50 - right thing in your class right um or
46:52 - keep playing on the you know the free
46:54 - play um level that we put at the end of
46:56 - the Tut tutorials um I think you know
46:58 - the Star Wars one in particular you can
47:00 - play for a long long long long time um
47:02 - so that when if you're worried about the
47:03 - kids finishing early I would recommend
47:04 - using the Star Wars one because there's
47:06 - lots and lots of space to keep making
47:08 - their games and playing their games and
47:09 - sharing their games um or try another
47:11 - tutorial and you can either have one
47:13 - lined up for them to try um or you could
47:16 - just say go you know you're free you
47:18 - finished go pick something um and then
47:21 - it related to your other question of
47:22 - finishing the courses so if they finish
47:24 - course one you can go to course two or
47:26 - course three or course fer or if they
47:28 - finish early within a class one of the
47:29 - things we've done within our um K5
47:31 - courses or sorry CS fundamentals courses
47:34 - um is every every level has a little
47:36 - Link at the top to go create your own
47:38 - project or play lab or artist and so um
47:41 - there's just activities the students can
47:42 - do there to help like create their own
47:44 - projects or create their own artist
47:46 - things but related to hour of code I
47:48 - would just tell them play in the free
47:49 - play level or go ahead and do another
47:51 - tutorial one easy thing to do would be
47:53 - start them in Star Wars and if they
47:55 - finish that send them to Minecraft or
47:57 - Versa um I'd be really surprised if
47:59 - students get through both of those
48:00 - tutorials in an hour we've done a lot of
48:01 - testing and I'd be shocked if six to 10
48:03 - year olds could finish both of those in
48:04 - one hour yeah even the fast ones yeah
48:08 - the thing is you know I created account
48:09 - so I gave them their use you know their
48:11 - username um and the password so they're
48:14 - using it at home I'm like what happened
48:16 - they did it at home which I love you
48:17 - know it's a motivation and I said I want
48:20 - the test scores to go up then this year
48:23 - that's awesome I love it I love it
48:24 - that's a good problem to have the kids
48:26 - are doing school work at home so they
48:28 - nothing to do with school that's like
48:29 - that's a good
48:30 - problem I would explore some our third
48:33 - party tutorials they're great they are
48:35 - great they are great thank you Evelyn um
48:38 - so had some bye thank you for making the
48:40 - effort to be here we have about 10
48:42 - minutes left and a lot of questions on
48:44 - Deck there also a lot of questions in
48:46 - the chat pod that we're responding to I
48:48 - just want to make sure folks know that
48:50 - we are we have recorded this session so
48:52 - that you'll be able to watch it later
48:53 - and then on December 2nd we're going to
48:55 - have a followon Q&A session so if I
48:57 - don't get to your question tonight or
48:59 - Alis or Laura don't don't worry there
49:00 - are still lots of ways to get support um
49:03 - including another call just like this
49:04 - one in a couple weeks um so I can see a
49:07 - couple folks on video I also have given
49:09 - microphone rights to other folks um if
49:11 - someone wants to unmute and go ahead and
49:13 - ask a question that's great we'd be
49:15 - happy to answer
49:16 - it how about Elizabeth I see you see you
49:19 - up here
49:30 - I think we lost our
49:32 - Diana hi hello ladies hi my this is my
49:36 - first year I normally teach Math and
49:38 - Science my first year that we're
49:40 - starting a stem program in our school
49:42 - and I am teaching a technology special
49:44 - so I've really been able to spend a lot
49:46 - of time on code my students have been
49:48 - working already for a couple weeks so
49:51 - we're very very excited I've really been
49:53 - pushing it and it's unbelievable um
49:57 - how um much problem solving is involved
50:01 - and they really are just amazing me so a
50:04 - big thank you to what you are what you
50:07 - guys are doing as a as a as a company as
50:09 - an organization um I just quick
50:12 - questions and I know they've probably
50:14 - been answered but I've been messing
50:15 - around with the computer and I I've had
50:17 - a couple times where the sound has gone
50:18 - off um but just to clarify um it is okay
50:25 - for them to already be working on the on
50:27 - the tutorials is that
50:29 - correct oh right now yes yes you can um
50:32 - they're in beta right now um which means
50:34 - we're still changing and improving them
50:35 - so we put them out there and then what
50:37 - we like to do is get a lot of feedback
50:39 - we've been testing them in classrooms
50:40 - I've taken them to second grade class
50:42 - High School class third fourth fifth
50:44 - grade class A couple another high school
50:46 - class I took him to an intro took him to
50:48 - an English class in high school where
50:49 - the kids had never done computer science
50:51 - before we took him to an AP Computer
50:52 - Science class so basically just trying
50:54 - to get lots of feedback from students
50:56 - and then what we're looking for are what
50:58 - do we need to do to change it so since
50:59 - we launched them last week and the week
51:02 - before we have clarified some error
51:04 - messages we've changed a few
51:05 - progressions we swapped levels three and
51:07 - four in the Star Wars to make it a
51:09 - little easier we made a couple things a
51:11 - little harder so we are making them
51:12 - better every day you are welcome to try
51:14 - them and we love getting you know the
51:17 - feedback early um it just makes them
51:19 - better for the other students so um
51:21 - that's great um just know that there's
51:22 - going to be some subtle changes between
51:24 - now and the hour of cod and on December
51:26 - 7th be great you know then there'll be
51:28 - the fully tested version that's ready
51:29 - for your class gotcha I I you know
51:31 - because they're doing it um in my class
51:34 - I they have passwords and they're able
51:36 - to log in from home and I do track their
51:38 - progress um I haven't been able to track
51:42 - I didn't see the a track from Minecraft
51:43 - is it just because it's still in
51:45 - beta we have to add it to the teacher
51:47 - dashboard we'll get that added we just
51:49 - added that it comes out later the next
51:51 - time we dtp sorry the next time we we
51:54 - it's it's in our stag in server so by
51:55 - tomorrow afternoon see that in the list
51:57 - yes awesome now will the ones that the
52:00 - PE the students that have been working
52:01 - on Minecraft already will that appear on
52:04 - the progress or it's only okay yeah yeah
52:08 - they'll have their progress there yeah
52:10 - great great and one one last quick
52:13 - question sorry one last quick question
52:16 - I'm getting feedback from the kids that
52:18 - are saying that they have to be in
52:20 - Google Chrome to be able to access that
52:22 - is that correct no no they use any
52:24 - browser um it works on
52:27 - Chrome you
52:30 - knowx it should work everywhere yeah
52:33 - okay so much great thank you thank you
52:36 - Diana so we have about three or four
52:39 - more folks who had raised their hand to
52:41 - ask questions so Flo JN Elizabeth and
52:45 - nice I see nice nice n's video is up um
52:49 - so if any of you would like to unmute go
52:51 - right ahead and ask a question
52:57 - we lost
53:01 - nice okay so if anyone else has a
53:03 - question and need raise your hand go
53:05 - ahead and unmute feel free and ladies
53:07 - just a couple more here in my list um
53:10 - let's
53:11 - see we went over the certificate
53:13 - procedure a couple times but there were
53:15 - a couple folks who are having an issue
53:16 - with it um so maybe we could just review
53:19 - that one more time and then JN I just
53:21 - saw you unmute did you want to go ahead
53:22 - and ask your question while Laura pull
53:24 - it up Laura's going to screen share the
53:27 - certificate that yeah go
53:29 - ahead wondering I had um asked for
53:32 - certificates to be sent and I saw in the
53:34 - discussion um somebody had written that
53:36 - they would be coming soon I just wanted
53:38 - to make sure that they would be sent to
53:39 - the
53:41 - school yeah posters the the the posters
53:45 - uh we gave away awesome posters and
53:48 - stickers to the first 15,000 teachers
53:50 - who signed up for the hour of code and
53:53 - those started shipping this week uh and
53:55 - they should be arriving and uh whatever
53:58 - address that you put in that's where
54:00 - it'll be coming um if you want to
54:03 - contact support at code.org we can look
54:06 - up your name and make sure we know which
54:08 - uh address it's coming to but they were
54:10 - being shipped out this week okay thank
54:12 - you very much on that note too Laura
54:15 - while you're showing this um I there are
54:17 - a couple questions in the chat pot of
54:18 - people saying that their event isn't
54:20 - showing up on the map how do they know
54:21 - it's been registered should people email
54:24 - support at code.org if they want to know
54:26 - so the map is updated once a day usually
54:29 - at midnight Pacific time so if they if
54:32 - you're not seeing it right away it's
54:34 - because it's not a live map and so at
54:36 - midnight we scoop up everybody who's
54:38 - added an event and we put it on the map
54:41 - uh another thing that might be happening
54:43 - is if you're not typing in the full
54:45 - exact address it might be mapping you
54:47 - but to a different state or a different
54:50 - country so make sure you're typing in
54:52 - state and zip code to get it as exact as
54:55 - possible uh the third thing is you'll
54:57 - notice that we have some orange pens on
55:00 - the map and those are special events
55:02 - that we've highlighted uh we do those
55:04 - manually so here at code.org we read
55:07 - through those special events uh and we
55:09 - can highlight them on the map and so we
55:11 - don't we don't approve every event
55:14 - that's submitted we approve a handful of
55:16 - them as we get them uh and as we're able
55:18 - to check them um as frequently as we
55:25 - can show us certificates real quick yeah
55:28 - so here's code.org
55:30 - certificates uh and it's as easy as
55:32 - typing in your name uh or your students
55:36 - names uh and then you can do a whole
55:39 - list you can copy and paste their names
55:41 - in here because that would probably be a
55:43 - lot
55:46 - faster and then click on print
55:51 - certificates and it's going to bring up
55:53 - a preview of these certificates so
55:56 - you'll see a
55:58 - whole list of them ready to go and this
56:02 - is print ready so you can just print
56:04 - them by clicking that button and they're
56:06 - designed to print well in black and
56:08 - white or color we designed it so it'll
56:09 - look good even if you don't have a color
56:12 - printer other a question as to whether
56:14 - people could print a blank one and write
56:16 - the name on it
56:19 - later if you go without typing any name
56:22 - in it and you clicked print certificate
56:25 - [Music]
56:27 - a great one um we can add we'll have to
56:30 - figure that out we might be able to add
56:32 - a blank one to the resource page for
56:34 - teachers we'll look into that okay great
56:37 - now poor Elizabeth has been in and out
56:39 - trying to get her mic on so I'm gonna
56:40 - let her go and then nice you can go next
56:43 - um and then we'll probably close out the
56:45 - question section okay
56:47 - Elizabeth yeah um one question that I've
56:51 - had was can you hear me okay yeah okay
56:57 - um whenever students are doing the hour
56:59 - of code their progress saves at the top
57:03 - and I've had problems with when another
57:05 - student comes in that they're they're
57:08 - want to start at the beginning and that
57:10 - shows the other students progress and um
57:13 - one of the other people said that if I
57:15 - used incognito mode that would take care
57:17 - of that it would that work um yeah that
57:21 - would work but we've also um solved that
57:22 - problem we we if you click on so if you
57:26 - go to the name of the tutorial SL reset
57:29 - it will also reset it all and we've made
57:31 - it so that the links from slash learn
57:34 - automatically go to that slash reset so
57:37 - if you instead of just going directly to
57:39 - the you can do it in cognito mode or if
57:41 - you go to instead of going to the URL um
57:44 - if you I think the URLs do it this year
57:46 - too um but anyway if you click go on
57:49 - them it'll automatically reset for the
57:50 - next student um so I think that's new
57:53 - this year I don't think we had that last
57:54 - year so they just need to go back to the
57:56 - page and hit go again hit goarn and
57:59 - it'll automatically when you hit go
58:00 - again it automatically resets everything
58:02 - so you get a fresh start that's great
58:04 - thanks yeah okay nice um would you like
58:08 - to unmute and ask your question and
58:09 - Kiren if we have time I'll get to you as
58:13 - well go ahead we can hear
58:17 - you hi everybody
58:21 - hello nice from Sagal d
58:26 - I have just one question is about how to
58:29 - organize a successful event res have
58:33 - Network a good internet
58:39 - connection yeah no I think that the
58:41 - unplugged lessons are fantastic when you
58:43 - don't have a great internet connection I
58:45 - have done the unplugged lessons with
58:48 - different age kids they're really fun
58:50 - and they teach the same concepts of
58:51 - computer science without the computer so
58:54 - um that is a great way to to do it um
58:56 - we're also looking at whether there's
58:58 - some you know offline tutorial there
59:00 - isn't right now so right now i'
59:01 - recommend doing the unplugged lesson but
59:03 - check back on the site and if we can get
59:05 - something up that's offline before
59:06 - December 7th you could try that as well
59:09 - and I don't know if you have if you have
59:11 - access to desktop computers but we do
59:14 - have um a blockly tutorial uh that I
59:18 - believe UN in the unplugged section that
59:20 - you can download to your desktop and do
59:23 - on your desktop there's also one created
59:26 - by codable one of our partners that you
59:28 - can download to your desktop as
59:31 - well that'd be a good choice if you try
59:33 - the codable one download and in advance
59:35 - and then you can do it through you can
59:36 - chat us your uh email address we'll send
59:39 - you the links to both of
59:42 - those thank you nice thanks for the
59:46 - question kren do you want to close us
59:48 - out with the last
59:51 - question hi hi um so I I this is
59:57 - actually a technical question I got a
59:59 - confirmation email saying you know
60:01 - welcome to the hour of code and then
60:03 - when I go to sign on it says it doesn't
60:05 - recognize my email address and so I've
60:08 - now signed up like four or five times
60:10 - I'm actually the principal of the school
60:13 - and um I want to sign up my whole school
60:15 - my all my teachers have signed up so I
60:17 - wanted to be able to get credit as my
60:19 - school has signed up but I've contacted
60:21 - support and I haven't gotten any
60:24 - response from them either and I'm just
60:26 - starting to I just I'm worried that what
60:28 - if this happens on the day you know the
60:30 - week that we're doing it I'm trying to
60:31 - run this whole school's worth of of
60:34 - coding and I've promoted to my parents
60:36 - and I'm doing all this stuff and I can't
60:37 - even get into my own account so I didn't
60:39 - know if you had any suggestions about
60:41 - what to do and you have like a technical
60:43 - difficulty um I have plenty of time now
60:45 - to fix it but I'm worried about
60:47 - something like that happening did you
60:50 - you you signed up for the hour of code
60:51 - and now you're trying to go to code.org
60:54 - and sign into your account
60:57 - so signing up for the hour of code
60:59 - doesn't create a code Studio account for
61:01 - you this is a great question I'm sure a
61:03 - lot of teachers think this as well um
61:06 - when you sign up for the hour code
61:08 - that's a totally separate form if you
61:10 - want to create a code Studio account on
61:12 - code.org you have to fill out create an
61:15 - account on there so um that's definitely
61:18 - something we should put on our FAQs yeah
61:21 - we should we should We'll add that to
61:22 - the FAQ I think the reason for that is
61:24 - we wanted to make it easy to sign up for
61:26 - hour of code without creating an account
61:27 - on code Studio so that's why we have two
61:30 - different processes there um but yeah if
61:32 - you go to code Studio you can now click
61:35 - that signin button and then say you want
61:37 - to create a new account and you can
61:38 - create a code Studio account but you
61:40 - also do not need one as I was saying
61:41 - before you do not need one to do hour of
61:43 - code and you don't need one to run it
61:44 - for your school so your school's already
61:45 - sounded up it sounds like and you can go
61:47 - ahead and the students all your students
61:49 - and all your teachers can do the hour of
61:51 - code with no accounts yeah and that's
61:52 - all designed to make it easy yeah okay
61:55 - yeah so I thought so because we could we
61:57 - had access to the tutorials and
61:58 - everything but I was trying to do kind
62:00 - of the resources and the lesson plans
62:01 - and things like that and I was like why
62:03 - is my email not working okay so I have
62:05 - to sign up separately yeah very common
62:08 - good question good question great
62:10 - question a good one to end us on um
62:12 - because it allows me to segue into Ken
62:15 - Alice demoed how to create an account
62:17 - earlier tonight so when I send you the
62:19 - recording later you may want to go back
62:20 - and just watch that section um but we
62:23 - also have a whole bunch of resources on
62:24 - code Studio an hour of code.com that
62:27 - answerers some of these FAQs and some
62:29 - demo videos and things like that so
62:30 - thank you for bringing that question
62:32 - forward uh Laura do you want to go back
62:34 - to the fli just real quick yeah um we're
62:36 - out of time we're actually over time
62:38 - this has been a great discussion it's
62:39 - been so fun to hear you guys and to hear
62:42 - your questions I'm certain that we
62:43 - missed a lot of questions in the chat
62:45 - but um I think Kate Alice Laur and
62:47 - myself can hang out for a few minutes
62:49 - and try to answer things um but if you
62:51 - did not get your question answered
62:52 - tonight you have a bunch of options um
62:54 - first of all we are going to be having
62:57 - another meeting just like this on
62:58 - December 2nd um with Alice and our
63:01 - founder of code.org K partovi and the
63:04 - full hour will be dedicated to Q&A so
63:06 - you can bring your questions then um you
63:08 - can also tweet your questions to us at
63:10 - teach code or at code org and we will
63:13 - answer via Twitter and then if you have
63:15 - a technical question if you think
63:16 - there's something wrong with your
63:18 - account or you found a bug or something
63:20 - like that definitely email that to
63:21 - support code.org and we'll answer it
63:23 - that way as well so just a few quick
63:26 - reminders if you haven't already
63:27 - registered your hour of code event
63:29 - please do and as you're celebrating hour
