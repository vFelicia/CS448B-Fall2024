00:05 - ﻿One of the benefits of lists is that their length 
can grow and shrink over the course of a program,  
00:10 - but that means it can be useful to find the 
length of a list at a given point in time.  
00:15 - You can get the length for a 
list like this: numList.length.  
00:20 - When your program runs, the computer will 
replace this with the current length of the list.  
00:25 - In this case, the length of the list is 6. A 
potential point of confusion is that even though  
00:31 - the length of a list is 6, the last index is 5. 
This is because we start the indexing at 0. 
 
00:38 - Because lists change size, a common 
issue in programming with lists is:  
00:42 - what’s the index of the last element? We 
typically find out using the expression:  
00:47 - [num]List.length – 1, and you frequently 
see it used to access the last element  
00:51 - of the list like this: numList and in 
square brackets numList.length – 1. 
 
01:00 - Lists are a very powerful way to store and 
maintain data in programs. They open the door  
01:05 - for us to write programs that use and process lots 
and lots of information, especially when we don’t  
01:10 - know ahead of time just how much information 
needs to be stored. Let’s try them out!
