00:00 - (Trina Roy - Pixar Engineer)
I got my start in software working on
00:03 - Shrek actually a long, long time ago.
00:05 - You're taking these basic building blocks:
00:07 - loops, and counters, and algorithms.
00:10 - You use that stuff every single day and you
00:12 - gradually build them all up
00:14 - and it just turns into this tool that an artist can take
00:17 - and just run with it and just do really amazing things with it.
00:20 - Hey there, so you did your squares - good job.
00:24 - We're gonna make it a little bit easier this time.
00:27 - We're going to do the same squares
00:28 - only we're going to use something called a counter loop.
00:30 - A counter loops is just like a regular loop,
00:32 - but every time you loop around
00:34 - you add a little bit of a number.
00:36 - So, you see your counter loop right here,
00:38 - it came from the loop section.
00:39 - Then you've got your draw square function
00:41 - that you've been using all along.
00:43 - So now, you just go into the variables section
00:46 - you pull out that counter block, you stick it into the length bit.
00:49 - So now what you've got is something that says,
00:51 - count with counter - from 50 to 90 using 10 - draw a square.
00:56 - So what that's going to do
00:57 - is it will first draw a square with sides of 50,
01:01 - then it will add 10 to the counter,
01:03 - draw it again, then as it loops around it adds 10 each time.
01:06 - So you get squares of 50 ,60, 70, 80, 90.
01:10 - So your zombie is going to be a master artist.
01:12 - Good job!
