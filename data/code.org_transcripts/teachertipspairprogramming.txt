00:04 - so prep programming is super beneficial
00:06 - in the classroom uh if you use it often
00:10 - at the beginning of your school year
00:12 - by the middle and the end of the year
00:14 - you're not gonna have to prom them i
00:16 - have my students working together from
00:18 - the first lesson unit one lesson one
00:20 - with the rapid prototype and i usually
00:22 - keep those groups together going through
00:24 - the course with
00:26 - modifications here and there but that
00:29 - teamwork that they establish from day
00:31 - one gives them the confidence to get
00:33 - through the rest of the course where
00:34 - they know they can rely on their partner
00:37 - who's sitting beside them or they can
00:39 - talk to someone else in the classroom
00:40 - and feel like they can share their ideas
00:42 - and get feedback anytime a student does
00:45 - something for the first time
00:47 - they're not going to do it very well
00:49 - the only way they're going to get better
00:51 - is with practice several iterations you
00:54 - modeling and encouraging and supporting
00:57 - and so patience
00:59 - that's what's going to help
01:01 - when debugging becomes um a
01:03 - collaborative experience it starts to
01:05 - become a lot more fun it becomes more
01:07 - like
01:08 - a
01:09 - investigate and become the detective
01:11 - type of role and so
01:14 - encouraging collaboration pair
01:16 - programming can help them debug as a new
01:19 - css teacher i do recommend that you have
01:22 - timers and make the timers fun
01:25 - ask the students to stand up from the
01:27 - chairs when they have to change the role
01:28 - from navigator to driver
01:30 - and
01:32 - have the timer go in different chunks of
01:35 - time start giving the students a minute
01:37 - here to be a driver a minute there to be
01:40 - the navigator and after you
01:42 - prime them with this the last chunk of
01:45 - time make it longer and you will notice
01:47 - that the students
01:49 - actually start switching
01:52 - because they they learn the routine they
01:54 - learn the technique and they switch from
01:56 - navigator to driver without you
01:58 - prompting them to do so i had two
02:00 - different students and they worked
02:02 - really well together when they were
02:04 - their programming and it was interesting
02:06 - because they were totally opposites of
02:08 - each other one was really introverted
02:10 - one was really
02:11 - extroverted and kind of boisterous and
02:14 - the interaction back and forth between
02:16 - them was so hilarious they had a great
02:19 - relationship
02:21 - in this instance but most of the time
02:23 - they probably wouldn't talk with each
02:25 - other even though they were working
02:27 - together solving problems
02:29 - they were having fun
02:38 - you
