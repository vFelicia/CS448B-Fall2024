00:00 - Unplugged Activity | Building a Foundation
00:06 - In sand sculpture, you gotta know that failure
00:09 - is part of the program here. You gotta expect
it, you gotta plan for it, but if you persist
00:14 - it's just gonna get nothing but better and more
exciting for you. That's the name of the game
00:19 - here, just persist and stay with it, and you'll
love it.
00:27 - This lesson is called "Building a Foundation"
00:31 - In this lesson, we'll work on
a task that's meant to be really difficult.
00:35 - You guys will figure out how to make a structure
at least as tall as one of these cups.
00:43 - And it's gotta be strong enough to 
hold the weight of a book.
00:49 - Nope. Nope. Uhh...nope.
00:52 - There might be times that our creation doesn't work out.
00:57 - Agh! We lost it but let's
recover.
01:01 - I have the perfect idea! I need more gumdrops though.
01:05 - There might be times that we get
frustrated and want to give up.
01:11 - There might be a lot of those moments. (frustrated)
Ugh! I cannot get this! But if we keep on
01:17 - trying, giving it our best shot over and over
again, then we're sure to get it before long.
01:26 - Success! Persistence is all about hanging
in there when you really want to give up.
01:34 - If you want to create something new and different,
there's going to be a lot of failures along
01:39 - the way. The trick to persistence is choosing
to keep on going and learn from your failures,
01:47 - instead of quitting because you're frustrated.
Frustration actually just means there's something
01:52 - wonderful around the corner. (I wonder if this will work this time) So don't quit before you get to it.
