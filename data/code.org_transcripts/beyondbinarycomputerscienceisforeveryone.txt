00:00 - I believe that computer science is truly
00:02 - for everyone if we are ever going to
00:04 - experience equity and Tech and truly
00:06 - close the digital divide we must have
00:08 - people of all backgrounds shapes sizes
00:10 - colors and experiences obviously
00:13 - alluring was a big influence in computer
00:15 - science but there have been many others
00:17 - there are tons of awesome lgbtqia people
00:22 - in computer science there's a huge
00:24 - Community there are a lot of resources
00:27 - if the usual ways of making Comm
00:29 - Community or reaching out to community
00:31 - does not work for you computer science
00:33 - is a place where you can build and find
00:36 - the way to reach out to people the great
00:39 - thing about computer science is that the
00:41 - content that we're working on is
00:43 - something that is universal and you can
00:45 - find other folks like you who want to
00:47 - solve the same problems you're solving
00:49 - and share other interests as well I
00:51 - believe that computer science is the new
00:53 - means of communication so if you are
00:55 - able to use that tool to get a message
00:58 - across to provide information that can
01:00 - be lifechanging to a community or group
01:03 - of people that's the ultimate power it's
01:05 - really nice when you think about a
01:07 - solution to a problem and then you see
01:10 - this solution shipped and you see real
01:12 - people using the thing that you thought
01:14 - about that's probably the most rewarding
01:16 - thing about my
01:17 - job as we build software systems that
01:21 - increasingly govern more and more of the
01:23 - world we want those systems to be fair
01:27 - and Equitable and representative of you
01:29 - users everyone has a unique way to solve
01:32 - a problem and if we get all those
01:34 - different people together we can solve
01:36 - software problems that you can't solve
01:38 - on your own you know if everyone was the
01:39 - same that would just be a very
01:41 - uninteresting product I think and I
01:44 - think that's why there's so much
01:45 - Innovation happening in Tech right now
01:48 - is it's just growing and there's
01:49 - different types of people who are coming
01:51 - in and helping make things the way that
01:54 - they are when a group of diverse people
01:56 - are working on solving a problem they
01:58 - come up with better Solutions computer
02:00 - science is for everyone if you have a
02:03 - question computer science is for you you
02:06 - have a problem that you think a lot of
02:07 - other people have that you want to solve
02:09 - computer science is for you anybody can
02:12 - do this and we want everybody to be
02:14 - doing this we need storytellers we need
02:18 - artists we need musicians we need you we
02:21 - need your voice and we need you to have
02:23 - a seat at our table
