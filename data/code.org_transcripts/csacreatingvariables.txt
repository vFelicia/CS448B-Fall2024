00:10 - we use variables a lot in coding
00:13 - but what exactly is a variable
00:16 - in short a variable is a container for
00:18 - storing a value
00:20 - that means like a baggie or a cop
00:22 - the container itself doesn't change but
00:24 - what you put in it can
00:27 - once created the variable is stored in
00:29 - the computer's memory and can be used
00:31 - and updated repeatedly throughout a
00:33 - program
00:35 - in java we have two specific types of
00:37 - variables
00:38 - primitive and reference variables
00:41 - in java primitive variables store our
00:44 - more basic pieces of data like ins for
00:46 - whole numbers doubles for decimals and
00:49 - booleans for true false
00:52 - let's use baggies with sticky notes in
00:53 - them to represent the number primitives
00:56 - and a toggle for the boolean primitive
00:58 - yellow for ins
01:00 - green for doubles and blue for booleans
01:04 - for objects such as strings we have
01:06 - reference variables think baggy with an
01:09 - arrow
01:10 - the container our baggie holds an arrow
01:12 - that points to a memory location where
01:14 - each object exists
01:16 - look inside the baggie the red arrow has
01:18 - a memory address on it
01:20 - the program can find that address in
01:22 - computer memory and look up information
01:24 - about the object
01:26 - see each pocket in memory
01:28 - we can store a lot of different pieces
01:30 - of information related to our object in
01:32 - there
01:34 - once we have decided we want to create a
01:35 - variable we have three distinct
01:37 - decisions to make
01:39 - number one
01:40 - what data type do we want maybe it's an
01:42 - int or double or string
01:45 - two what do we name the variable
01:48 - and three what if anything would we like
01:51 - to store in it
01:53 - for example let's say i want to store
01:55 - the number 8.5 which is the standard
01:57 - width of a piece of paper in inches
02:00 - what data type are we storing
02:02 - it's a decimal so we'll use double
02:05 - this is a primitive so we'll use a green
02:07 - long sticky note
02:09 - what do we name it
02:11 - with
02:12 - what if anything would we like to store
02:14 - in it
02:15 - 8.5
02:18 - in java when declaring a variable we
02:21 - write the data type then the name of the
02:23 - variable followed by a semicolon
02:26 - we don't have to give the variable an
02:27 - immediate value but if we wanted to
02:29 - initialize a value we use the assignment
02:32 - operator
02:33 - we can also declare the variable and
02:35 - initialize in one line
02:38 - for a reference variable we will have
02:40 - our variable point to a place in memory
02:43 - strings are a great example of a
02:44 - reference variable
02:46 - for example let's create a string
02:48 - variable with the name cake color
02:51 - if we give it the value orange we place
02:53 - the text orange in memory and link to it
02:55 - from our variable cake color
02:58 - in java we would write this like so
03:01 - string
03:02 - cake color equals orange
03:06 - variable store information we can use in
03:09 - our programs
