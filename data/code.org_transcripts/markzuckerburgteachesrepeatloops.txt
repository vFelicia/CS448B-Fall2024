00:00 - One thing that computers are really good
at is repeating commands.
00:03 - As a person, you'd get really bored if you
had to do the same thing lots of times in a row.
00:08 - But a computer can do the same thing
millions or even billions of times,
00:12 - and not get bored and be able to carry
that out really well.
00:15 - So for example if I wanted to wish
00:17 - everyone on Facebook a happy birthday by
sending them an email,
00:20 - it might take me more than a century to
actually write out all of those emails to everyone.
00:25 - But with just a few lines of code, I can have a system
00:28 - send an email to everyone on Facebook
wishing them a happy birthday.
00:32 - So that's what loops are, and why they're valuable,
00:34 - and something that computers can do very well.
