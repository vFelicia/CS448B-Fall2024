00:06 - You'll be learning to use a programming tool
called evaluation blocks to write mathematical
00:12 - expressions.
00:14 - Let's look at the evaluation block for addition
to see how it works.
00:18 - First you'll see the name that describes what
the block does at the top.
00:23 - Here it's a plus sign.
00:25 - Then underneath that, the inputs that the
block needs.
00:29 - When we evaluate the block, we start from
left to right.
00:34 - Here's how we would use it to program the
computer to add 1 and 2.
00:39 - In the next stage, you'll see a simple arithmetic
expression in the bottom of the play area.
00:45 - Your goal is to replicate that expression
with the evaluation blocks.
00:49 - When you click run, you'll see your code evaluate
step-by-step in the play area.
