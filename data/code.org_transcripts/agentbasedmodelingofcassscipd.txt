00:06 - hi
00:06 - my name is gabrielle beans and i'm a
00:08 - research scientist turned science
00:10 - educator my field of research was in
00:12 - studying population genetics of penguins
00:14 - by looking at dna from living penguins
00:17 - as well as from their seven thousand
00:19 - year old bones
00:21 - but today i'll be introducing
00:23 - agent-based modeling of complex adaptive
00:25 - systems
00:26 - and there are many different ways to
00:27 - model natural phenomena or man-made
00:29 - systems
00:30 - each type of modeling is appropriate in
00:32 - different circumstances
00:34 - and we're going to focus
00:35 - today on one type of modeling known as
00:37 - agent-based modeling in agent-based
00:39 - modeling you create the model by
00:41 - describing the agents giving them rules
00:43 - to follow and then letting them interact
00:45 - with each other and their environment
00:48 - the model can then be used to run
00:49 - experiments that could help us
00:51 - understand the real world
00:53 - for example
00:54 - you could create an agent-based model of
00:56 - an ecosystem by creating some predator
00:58 - agents and some prey agents and then you
01:01 - could see the resulting population
01:02 - dynamics as the predator and prey
01:04 - interact
01:06 - another thing you could do would be to
01:08 - create an agent-based model of an
01:09 - epidemic by making many date many
01:12 - different agents to represent a
01:13 - population and see how a disease might
01:15 - spread through the population by having
01:17 - healthy agents become sick after
01:19 - touching a sick agent
01:21 - it seems pretty simple
01:23 - but agent-based models can actually be
01:25 - very sophisticated and can be used to
01:27 - model and understand complex adaptive
01:29 - systems just by giving agents simple
01:31 - rules to follow
01:33 - to make agent-based computer modeling
01:35 - easy for beginners we will use a
01:37 - computer modeling and simulation tool
01:39 - that helps with creating agents and
01:40 - giving them rules to follow
01:43 - this way you don't need advanced
01:44 - mathematics to work with interesting and
01:46 - powerful models
01:47 - so let me walk you through the thought
01:49 - process we use when planning a model
01:52 - there are certain questions that can
01:54 - help us with to guide our design of
01:56 - agent-based models
01:58 - i'll share these questions with you as
01:59 - well as an example of how we answer them
02:02 - so the questions are in the first place
02:05 - what is the scientific question you're
02:07 - interested in
02:08 - question number two what is the
02:10 - phenomenon system or process that you
02:12 - need to model to answer this question
02:15 - what are the features of interest to
02:16 - model
02:18 - and how will you capture data on these
02:20 - features
02:22 - who or what are the agents
02:25 - how do the agents behave and interact
02:26 - with each other or the environment
02:29 - how will you build and test your model
02:32 - and then how will you use that model to
02:34 - run experiments that help you answer
02:36 - your original question
02:38 - so say we were interested in modeling an
02:41 - underwater ecosystem with fish kelp and
02:43 - sharks
02:44 - in our example we've answered the
02:46 - questions like this
02:47 - so question one what is the scientific
02:50 - question you're interested in
02:51 - the answer would be how does an
02:53 - ecosystem with predators and prey remain
02:55 - stable
02:57 - second question was what is the system
02:59 - or process we want to model
03:02 - and in this case it would be an
03:03 - underwater ecosystem with fish kelp and
03:06 - sharks
03:07 - what are the features of interest of the
03:08 - model
03:09 - well we hypothesize a certain parameters
03:11 - such as how fast the fish sharks and
03:13 - kelp reproduce
03:15 - as well as how much energy the fish gets
03:17 - from eating kelp and the sharks get from
03:18 - eating fish will affect each species
03:21 - longevity in the ecosystem
03:23 - it would also be important to track the
03:25 - numbers of fish kelp and sharks over
03:28 - time
03:30 - so how will the model visualize these
03:32 - features
03:34 - by using different shapes for each agent
03:37 - and who are what are the agents
03:39 - well the agents are the three species
03:41 - making up the ecosystem fish kelp and
03:43 - sharks
03:45 - and
03:46 - how do the agents behave and interact
03:48 - with each other or with the environment
03:51 - all of the agents move around randomly
03:54 - when a fish agent encounters a kelp
03:56 - agent it eats it
03:57 - the kelp disappears and the fish gains
04:00 - energy
04:00 - when the shark eats the fish it also
04:02 - gains energy
04:04 - the fish and the shark reproduce when
04:06 - they have the right amount of energy and
04:08 - the kelp reproduces at a rate
04:09 - independent of energy
04:13 - another question was how will you build
04:15 - and test the model
04:17 - and so how we're going to do that is by
04:19 - using an agent-based modeling program to
04:22 - build the model
04:23 - afterwards we'll run experiments collect
04:25 - data for example by changing how often
04:28 - the different species can reproduce or
04:30 - by changing any other variable that
04:32 - we're interested in
04:33 - and what can we learn from this model
04:36 - so in this particular model we could
04:38 - gain an understanding of how delicate
04:40 - the equilibrium of an ecosystem is by
04:42 - seeing how easily one species can take
04:44 - over and the others go extinct
04:47 - agent-based modeling has been
04:49 - successfully used by teachers and
04:50 - students to model and study complex
04:52 - adaptive systems
04:54 - we really hope you'll enjoy creating
04:56 - agent-based models too
04:58 - it'll not only help you understand
04:59 - systems in a different light but you
05:01 - might be surprised just how much fun it
05:03 - can be
