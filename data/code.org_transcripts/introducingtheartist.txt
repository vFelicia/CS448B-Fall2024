00:01 - (JR Hildebrand - race car driver) 
You wouldn't even qualify for the race
00:03 - if you don't have people that are proficient in
00:06 - computer sciences, because of how much data the cars collect.
00:10 - And the necessity to be able to have people that can write programs
00:14 - that figure out how you can continue to build performance.
00:18 - In these puzzles you will be an artist
00:20 - that uses a pencil to draw different shapes.
00:22 - So where ever your artist goes it will draw a line behind him.
00:25 - To move around the canvas, you'll use the move forward block.
00:29 - Here, the move forward block says, move forward by 100 pixels.
00:34 - When we hit run, what happens?
00:36 - The artist moves forward a certain amount
00:38 - and that amount is 100 pixels.
00:41 - Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your computer screen.
00:47 - The other block we have in this puzzle says,
turn right by ninety degrees.
00:51 - And when we drag that out.
00:53 - That makes our artist turn a certain amount.
00:55 - So you can play around with how far you want the artist to turn.
00:58 - This is a 90 degree turn.
01:02 - And this is a 120 degree turn.
01:04 - And remember you can change these values by clicking on the arrows
01:08 - next to the numbers for pixels and degrees.
01:11 - Enjoy drawing with your artist.
