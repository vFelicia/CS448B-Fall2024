Hey guys, We're here at NASA's jet propulsion lab
00:03 - in the room where we control the Curiosity rover,
00:05 - which is on Mars right now exploring the planet.
00:08 - The rover navigates Mars using a computer program
00:10 - that works a lot like the last puzzle you just solved.
00:12 - The last bit of code you created, lays out instructions that can tell any
00:16 - robot how to find its way through a
00:18 - non-branching maze or tunnel of any complexity or length.
00:22 - It could be a zombie, a bird, a self-driving car or even a Mars rover.
00:27 - The code you wrote can get it where it needs to go.

You may not think that you learned a lot in your first hour of code.
00:34 - But actually, these basic concepts you just learned
00:37 - are at the heart of every program or app that you'll ever create.
00:41 - So we've learned about Repeat loops, Repeat-Until statements
00:44 - IF statements, the IF-ELSE block
00:46 - But hey! Guess What?
00:48 - Don't stop here. There's tons of other stuff to learn!
00:51 - Visit Code.org and continue your education into coding.
00:54 - Once you complete our full 20 hour curriculum
00:57 - you'll have mastered the basics of programming
00:59 - and can start learning how to write phone apps,
01:01 - games or robot instructions. Or really, anything, you name it.
01:05 - Technology is changing everything we do and it doesn't matter
01:08 - if you're young or old, programming is fun.
01:11 - And guess what? Anyone Can Do It.
