00:04 - ﻿[Closed captioning: What Is the Internet?]
[Music] 
00:07 - What is the internet?
The internet is like a popular thing. 
00:12 - Some satellites up there.
I picture it in my head with like waves of  
00:17 - internet going to the phone.
Somebody told me a cloud once. 
00:20 - The internet is a lot like 
plumbing. It’s always moving. 
00:23 - Most people don’t have any idea where the 
internet came from, and it doesn’t matter,  
00:27 - they don’t need to. It’s sort of like asking who 
invented the ballpoint pen, or the flush toilet,  
00:32 - or, you know, the zipper. These are all things we 
just use every day. We don’t even think about the  
00:37 - fact that one day, somebody invented them.
So, the internet is just like that. Many,  
00:42 - many years ago, in the early 1970s, my 
partner Bob Kahn and I began working on the  
00:48 - design of what we now call the internet.
It was a result of another experiment  
00:54 - called the ARPANET, which stood for Advanced 
Research Projects Agency Network. It was a  
00:59 - Defense Department research project.
Paul Baran was trying to figure out  
01:04 - how to build a communication system that 
might actually survive a nuclear attack. 
01:10 - So he had this idea of breaking messages up into 
blocks and sending them as fast as possible in  
01:16 - every possible direction through the mesh network.
So we built what eventually became a nationwide  
01:23 - experimental packet network, and it worked!
[Loud, electronic music] 
01:31 - Is anybody in charge of the internet?
The government controls it. 
01:35 - Elves. Obviously elves!
The people who control the Wi-Fi because then  
01:40 - no Wi-Fi, no internet.
T-Mobile, um, Xfinity. 
01:45 - Bill Gates.
Bill Gates. 
01:47 - Bill Gates.[pause] Right?
The honest answer is well nobody,  
01:53 - and maybe another answer is everybody.
The real answer is that the internet is  
01:58 - made up of an incredibly large number 
of independently operated networks. 
02:03 - What’s interesting about the system is that it’s 
fully distributed. There’s no central control  
02:08 - that’s deciding how packets are routed 
or where pieces of network are built,  
02:12 - or even who interconnects with whom.
These are all business decisions that  
02:16 - are made independently by the operators.
They are all motivated to assure that there  
02:21 - is end-to-end connectivity of every part of the 
network, because the utility of the net is that  
02:26 - any device can communicate with any other device, 
just like you want to be able to make phone calls  
02:30 - to any other telephone in the world.
There’s nothing like this that  
02:34 - has ever been built before.
The idea that what you know  
02:37 - might be useful to somebody else or vice 
versa is a very powerful motivator for  
02:43 - sharing information. By the way that's how 
science gets done, people share information. 
02:47 - So, this is an opportunity for people to think up 
new applications, maybe program them as apps on a  
02:54 - mobile phone, maybe become part of the continued 
growth of the infrastructure of the network to  
03:00 - bring it to people who don’t have access to it 
yet, or just make use of it on a day-to-day basis. 
03:05 - You can’t escape from contact with the 
internet, so why not get to know it and use it?
