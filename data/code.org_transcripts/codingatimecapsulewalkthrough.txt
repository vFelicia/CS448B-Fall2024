00:03 - welcome to computer science connections
00:05 - coding a time capsule this module makes
00:08 - connections between social studies Ela
00:11 - and computer science specifically it can
00:14 - introduce reinforce or extend any
00:17 - student learning related to a specific
00:20 - historical event or time period if
00:23 - you're teaching about historical
00:24 - perspectives current events
00:26 - self-expression or just want to get your
00:29 - students coding you've come to the right
00:34 - place in this module students will learn
00:37 - the basics of sprite lab a block-based
00:39 - coding platform the main computer
00:42 - science Concepts in this module are
00:44 - Sprites and events a Sprite is something
00:47 - you interact with like a character in a
00:50 - game or an object in a scene Sprites can
00:53 - have different properties like its
00:55 - costume size and location en coding
01:00 - there are cause and effect relationships
01:02 - we trigger with events an event is an
01:05 - action that tells a specific chunk of
01:07 - code to run events allow us to change
01:11 - our programs in real time for example by
01:15 - assigning a spin right Behavior with a
01:17 - mouse click event we can command this
01:20 - hamburger to spin right when it's
01:28 - clicked
01:31 - there are four lessons in this module in
01:33 - lesson one students will learn the
01:34 - basics of sprite lab by coding the mood
01:36 - and imagery of a short poem written
01:39 - about a specific important Moment In
01:42 - Time students will set a background set
01:45 - text effects create Sprites with
01:47 - behaviors play sounds and Trigger events
01:50 - that correspond to certain lines of text
01:54 - notice this drop- down menu of poems
01:56 - above the play Space we provide a unique
01:59 - poem for each level but students can
02:02 - also choose which poem they want to
02:03 - illustrate by picking one from the list
02:06 - or entering their
02:11 - own in this unplugged lesson students
02:14 - will plan and write their own time
02:16 - capsule poem about the world they live
02:18 - in
02:21 - today in lesson three students use their
02:24 - poem from the previous lesson to create
02:26 - their personalized Time Capsule poems
02:28 - they will use block codes to animate and
02:30 - enhance their
02:36 - projects in the final unplugged lesson
02:39 - students will present their project to
02:41 - the peers they will discuss the
02:43 - importance of curation and what elements
02:45 - are essential in retelling
02:51 - history this module is focused on
02:54 - finding the mood or tone shifts within a
02:56 - poem to illustrate those shifts students
02:59 - need to to code new effects to be
03:01 - triggered when a particular line shows
03:03 - on the screen however waiting for each
03:05 - line to animate just to check your code
03:08 - can be cumbersome we suggest you show
03:10 - students how to try out different
03:12 - effects under the win run event when a
03:14 - student is satisfied with their code
03:16 - they can drag that chunk of code under
03:18 - the corresponding win line shows
03:25 - event a student might encounter a bug if
03:28 - the sprite's costume selection are
03:30 - inconsistent have students double check
03:32 - that they've selected the correct
03:34 - costume to call the intended spray in
03:37 - this example the coder wants the Sprite
03:38 - with a girl costume to grow when line
03:41 - one shows however the coder mistakenly
03:44 - assigned the basketball Sprite to grow
03:46 - because there is no basketball Sprite in
03:48 - the play Space nothing will happen to
03:51 - debug change the basketball Sprite to
03:53 - the Sprite with a girl costume in this
03:58 - block
04:07 - if students struggle to enter their own
04:08 - poem model how to use the drop- down
04:10 - above the play Space to select enter my
04:17 - own in every lesson plan discussion
04:20 - questions are coupled with discussion
04:22 - goals check for understanding and
04:24 - promote student Reflection by
04:26 - incorporating these discussion questions
04:28 - into your teaching
04:33 - review the concepts of mood and imagery
04:35 - with your students use the provided
04:37 - slides show to introduce these Concepts
04:39 - and teach the vocabulary within the
04:41 - context of the lesson explain to
04:43 - students that mood and imagery can be
04:46 - illustrated by the code students write
04:48 - students can illustrate mood with visual
04:54 - effects this module is aligned with the
04:56 - college career and Civic life framework
04:59 - common core Ela standards and the
05:01 - computer science Teachers Association
05:03 - standards in order to align to the
05:05 - concepts you already teach to help you
05:08 - think of ways to integrate ask yourself
05:10 - how might this module support the
05:12 - content I'm already teaching and should
05:15 - I use this module to introduce reinforce
05:18 - or extend student learning on this
05:22 - topic don't forget about the hide and
05:25 - show feature for each lesson it's best
05:27 - practice to only show the lesson
05:29 - students are currently working on if you
05:31 - do not hide the following lessons
05:33 - students will be moved on to the next
05:35 - lesson
05:39 - automatically before teaching this
05:41 - module try the lessons and review the
05:43 - lesson plans and additional resources
05:45 - code.org provides resources like slides
05:48 - student handouts and helpful hints to
05:51 - help you and your students get
05:58 - started
