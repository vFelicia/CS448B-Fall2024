00:20 - All computer scientists, no matter how
experienced they are, run into errors
00:25 - that they need to fix. This is where
debugging comes in. Debugging is just a
00:30 - word that means finding and fixing errors in
a program, and the first step toward fixing
00:35 - errors is to find them. Most puzzles have
a step button below the play space that
00:40 - you can use to hunt for problems. If your
program doesn't work
00:44 - press the step button and see what
happens. Does the character take action
00:50 - in the right way? If everything looks good
with the first block of code, press the
00:54 - step button again. How does everything
look? Is it still running right? Keep
01:00 - going through your code line by line until you find the first place where things go
01:04 - wrong. What happened? What was supposed to
happen?
01:07 - What does that tell you? In this puzzle, I
get to the last line of code and don't
01:13 - reach the goal. What happened? I got to
the end of my code without solving the
01:18 - puzzle. What was supposed to happen? I
need to go forward one more step. What
01:24 - does that tell me? It tells me I need to drag
out one more of these blocks and attach
01:30 - it to the end before I click run. Tada!
That's how you debug a program!
