00:01 - [Music]
00:04 - we can switch this way so we can see
00:06 - ourselves
00:07 - oh there i am
00:09 - hi there uh
00:11 - and we're here to
00:12 - kick off
00:13 - at one hour during eu code week of
00:16 - streaming to teach
00:18 - a little bit of uh coding and computer
00:20 - science to folks
00:21 - let me turn off our zoom background
00:23 - because it's distracting a little bit
00:28 - uh
00:31 - no background
00:35 - [Music]
00:37 - yay
00:38 - there we go
00:40 - all right um
00:42 - i wanted to ask everybody if you're uh
00:45 - joining us there's a number of ways you
00:47 - can chat with us but the most important
00:48 - one if you're not already familiar with
00:50 - it is the little chat button in the
00:51 - bottom of your screen
00:53 - if you see that there i'd love to see
00:55 - where people are calling in from so if
00:56 - you could chat and uh just type in the
00:58 - country or city that you're
01:01 - participating from so you can see where
01:02 - folks are
01:04 - we can see stuff you can you read some
01:05 - of these
01:06 - um songs from romania sounds from sweden
01:10 - greece germany abu dhabi
01:13 - denmark
01:15 - paris
01:16 - austria
01:18 - belgium
01:22 - portugal
01:23 - macedonia
01:25 - wow myanmar that's pretty far away
01:29 - croatia i've seen a lot of people from
01:31 - romania rhode island okay we have some
01:34 - folks from the united states even uh
01:36 - well folks are calling in from all over
01:37 - the place at an eu code week is one of
01:40 - the first weeks of the year where
01:42 - uh folks from all over the world in
01:44 - europe are basically participating in
01:47 - computer science uh
01:49 - sophie and i wanted to spend some time
01:50 - showing coding at to folks uh using the
01:53 - code.org platform you know the hour of
01:55 - code is one of the things that kicked
01:57 - off basically this idea of one-hour
01:59 - introductions to computer science and
02:01 - since we started it uh eight years ago
02:04 - we've now had over one billion hours of
02:06 - code done
02:07 - before we jump into this i want to get a
02:09 - sense of what grade level folks are in
02:11 - that are coming in so if you could type
02:13 - in what grade you're in and a number
02:15 - from 1 through 12 for the folk for the
02:18 - students who are in school so we could
02:20 - get a sense of what grades everybody's
02:22 - in grade six
02:24 - one to six that's lots of grades
02:30 - elementary school
02:34 - one to seven one to eight
02:37 - one to eight
02:38 - it sounds like these are classrooms
02:40 - uh dialing in elementary
02:43 - thirteen to fifteen
02:47 - and i also wanna get a sense of how many
02:49 - of high school mainly all right so we
02:51 - have basically students from all all
02:53 - ages teenagers elementary school
02:55 - students we're going to have a program
02:57 - that is basically kind of
03:00 - targeting all ages but we're going to
03:02 - start at the easier stuff and then get
03:03 - progressively harder over time so if
03:05 - you're more advanced it may take a
03:07 - little bit of uh you may need to be a
03:09 - little bit patient with us
03:11 - and if you have questions at any point
03:13 - please type it into the chat room we
03:15 - have some folks from code.org will be
03:17 - able to respond at
03:19 - and if you have questions for us to
03:21 - answer you can also use uh
03:24 - you can basically raise your hand
03:27 - you see a button that looks like this to
03:29 - raise your hand to ask a question
03:31 - although the chat is probably the best
03:32 - way to do that
03:35 - all right so sophia are you ready yeah
03:37 - so sophia is going to be doing most of
03:39 - the coding during this uh
03:41 - except for the maybe the most advanced
03:42 - stuff but what we're going to first do
03:44 - is a little bit of coding with a tool
03:47 - called artist and what we're going to
03:48 - learn about
03:50 - is
03:50 - algorithms sophia what's an algorithm
03:56 - you're not sure
03:59 - an algorithm is when you give a computer
04:01 - a set of instructions or a series of
04:03 - steps to solve a problem of some sort oh
04:05 - i was thinking of something else oh you
04:07 - were confused about what an algorithm is
04:09 - all right well it's one of those
04:11 - words that we learn in computer science
04:13 - and sophia is going to make an algorithm
04:14 - to do some drawings
04:16 - so let's
04:17 - first share my screen
04:23 - can everybody see this i hope
04:25 - so what we're looking at right now is
04:27 - the code.org artist tool
04:30 - and sophia is going to
04:32 - use this but what we see over here is
04:34 - the little artist he's going to be
04:35 - making the drawings
04:37 - over here are the commands he can use
04:39 - and over here is where the code is going
04:41 - to be that we're going to create so
04:42 - she's going to basically use these
04:43 - commands to make some code
04:45 - so sophia can you start by getting the
04:47 - artist to move
04:48 - 100 pixels to the right
04:54 - and then hit run to see what that's
04:56 - going to do
04:58 - all right so the artist moved 100 pixels
05:00 - to draw a line that's not super
05:02 - incredible but it's a first start
05:05 - so next what we want to do is have the
05:06 - artist draw a shape so sophie can you
05:08 - have the artist turn right after his
05:11 - little move command and then move again
05:18 - and now hit run
05:22 - all right so can you drive so can you uh
05:24 - basically copy that basically multiple
05:27 - more turn and move commands
05:30 - so maybe three or four more
05:32 - as as she's doing this i want people to
05:34 - uh to basically type in the chat area
05:36 - what they think this is gonna do when
05:38 - she hits the run button next
05:44 - keep going
05:54 - one more move and one more turn
06:03 - all right
06:04 - so what do you all think this is going
06:05 - to draw so eric says it's going to be a
06:07 - square
06:08 - so if you say can you hit run and reset
06:10 - again
06:13 - all right that's the square
06:15 - that's pretty simple so one thing we
06:17 - want to do is show the repeat blocks so
06:18 - if you take out most of these except
06:20 - just to move forward and turn right if
06:22 - you look it says move turn move turn
06:24 - move turn move turn so instead of doing
06:26 - it that way we can just repeat it four
06:28 - times
06:29 - so four times
06:31 - we're going to repeat this move turn
06:34 - this does the same thing so if i type
06:35 - the number four here
06:38 - and you hit the reset it draws a simple
06:40 - square now let's make every square
06:43 - make the square a random color and
06:45 - repeat and draw many many many many
06:47 - squares so
06:49 - basically drag another repeat block
06:54 - and
06:56 - put put it up there and put the first
06:58 - one inside there
07:00 - and now repeat like a hundred times
07:05 - not three thousand one hundred one
07:07 - hundred times
07:08 - and now each time the square gets drawn
07:10 - make it a different color
07:12 - so before you draw the square set color
07:15 - to random color
07:19 - so now we're going to draw 100 squares
07:22 - hit the reset button and start it over
07:23 - again
07:29 - and you can make it faster if you want
07:33 - okay stop that's getting boring but what
07:36 - you're seeing right now is a very simple
07:38 - algorithm where we're basically using
07:39 - the repeat command telling it not only
07:42 - to draw a square but to repeatedly draw
07:44 - a square but all those squares are right
07:46 - on top of each other so
07:48 - what are what are the things we could do
07:50 - that we can make so we can see every one
07:52 - of those squares individually maybe we
07:54 - can put another turn command so after
07:55 - each square there's a little bit of a
07:57 - turn
07:59 - not 90 degrees
08:02 - yeah pick a smaller number like maybe
08:04 - now you can use that angle thing to turn
08:06 - just a little bit a tiny little turn
08:08 - yeah that's good
08:10 - 11 degrees okay
08:12 - now hit run and see what happens
08:15 - so after every square it's doing a turn
08:21 - and it's going to keep going
08:25 - because we said 11 degrees
08:29 - so it's going to do 100 different little
08:31 - squares each one slightly farther apart
08:34 - from the other
08:43 - so what's cool about this do you want to
08:45 - see truck do the same thing by using
08:47 - triangles instead of squares
08:50 - so instead of doing
08:51 - the if we want to change that from a
08:53 - square to a triangle remember when we
08:55 - said repeat four times move forward and
08:56 - 90 degrees change that to move three
08:59 - times
09:00 - and then turn it two
09:02 - and
09:03 - oops
09:05 - three times
09:07 - and then turn right by we should do 120.
09:11 - yeah let's make this a little more too
09:14 - here and you want to change the turn
09:16 - okay so you just play with the numbers
09:18 - and then you can click run and make a
09:20 - different shape
09:23 - and now these are triangles
09:27 - yeah the other thing we could do is make
09:28 - stickers so why don't we make a sticker
09:32 - all throughout this square so drag the
09:33 - draw sticker shape
09:36 - and put it into the middle of that
09:38 - square
09:40 - or the triangle
09:42 - that's going to do it at the end of each
09:44 - one
09:44 - [Music]
09:46 - yeah do it like
09:47 - many times inside the triangle yeah
09:49 - something like that and let's choose a
09:51 - sticker so can folks type in the chat
09:53 - what sticker they want what shape should
09:55 - we put in there
09:56 - we have like an alien
09:58 - ghost a wizard a wizard
10:03 - somebody chose zombie
10:05 - okay which one of these is the zombie i
10:07 - don't see the zombie there's the zombie
10:09 - can you pick the zombie
10:12 - so now every single time that's drawing
10:15 - it's also going to draw zombies all over
10:16 - the place so hit the run button let's
10:18 - see what happens
10:20 - oh there's a lot of zombies everywhere
10:25 - we've created a monster
10:27 - all right so this is a very simple
10:29 - algorithm we just made
10:31 - and that was basically zombie
10:32 - apocalypse
10:34 - and one thing i want to show is anytime
10:36 - you write code on code.org and we're
10:38 - using the code.org hour of code right
10:40 - here do this when you hit the finish
10:42 - button you can see your creation
10:45 - you can share it and you can also send
10:47 - it to your phone so there's a qr code
10:50 - that you can actually scan with your
10:51 - phone and if you have your phone camera
10:53 - ready you could basically
10:56 - use that if you want
10:58 - if you want it so i'm gonna use my phone
11:00 - camera
11:01 - to scan that
11:03 - and it'll actually then
11:04 - show me how to go and then i can then
11:06 - get the same zombie apocalypse
11:12 - the same zombie apocalypse is now on my
11:14 - phone so it's really easy to build
11:17 - something that you also then send to a
11:18 - phone and play with
11:20 - i have zombies all over my phone
11:23 - so moving on let's do something
11:25 - different i want to now teach something
11:27 - else in computer science we learned
11:29 - about algorithms
11:30 - let's turn about let's learn about
11:33 - events
11:34 - so
11:35 - events sophia do you want to explain
11:37 - what are events in computer science
11:38 - event is not really like a run command
11:40 - but it's something that it can be played
11:43 - many times if you press something like
11:45 - for example a one if you have the code
11:48 - under event every time you press one
11:50 - that code will run
11:51 - yep so an event is when the computer is
11:53 - reacting to something that happened so
11:56 - instead of you just giving it the
11:57 - commands to do over and over and over
11:59 - you can say when the mouse is clicked or
12:01 - when a key is pressed or when when
12:04 - somebody taps the screen or if there's a
12:07 - very loud sound when something happens
12:10 - you make something happen that you you
12:12 - react to it so
12:14 - we're going to do something involving
12:16 - events but using dancing
12:18 - we're going to have
12:20 - sophia is going to do some dancing for
12:21 - us and we're going to program her using
12:24 - events and the events are going to say
12:26 - when you see the letter a
12:28 - and when you see the letter b
12:31 - and when you see the letter c
12:34 - and sophia are you ready to do the
12:35 - dancing
12:41 - is that gonna be better
12:43 - finally ask the audience so they can
12:45 - decide who's gonna do the dancing so why
12:48 - don't you all decide by chatting who
12:50 - should do the dancing sofia
12:52 - or hottie or dad if you don't know how
12:55 - to stop me people are saying howdy howdy
12:57 - come on let's have some folks ask for
12:59 - sophia
13:00 - oh come on
13:02 - all right i'm gonna do the dance yeah
13:05 - well wait eula says sophia it sounds
13:07 - like it's a tie most no see most there's
13:10 - a bunch of people who said sophia should
13:12 - do this two out of like
13:14 - five okay fine i'll do it
13:16 - so sofia is gonna hold up different
13:19 - letters a b and c
13:21 - and we're going to have three different
13:23 - dance moves for when she holds the
13:25 - letters but we want to have the audience
13:27 - choose what the dance moves are
13:29 - so the first is
13:32 - when
13:33 - the a is showing what should the dance
13:35 - move be the choices are let's say a kick
13:39 - or a clap
13:40 - uh kick or clap
13:43 - yeah what should we do on the letter a
13:45 - kick or clap
13:50 - okay it sounds like people are saying
13:53 - clap
13:54 - right so we're going to make the first
13:57 - command be that when the a shows we're
14:00 - going to do a clap
14:02 - all right the next dance move is going
14:04 - to be when the b shows hold up your
14:06 - letter b
14:08 - when the b shows
14:11 - we can choose between
14:13 - a
14:14 - dab or a floss
14:17 - so can folks type in what would you like
14:19 - on the letter b
14:21 - floss okay
14:23 - floss is like a really hard move so if
14:25 - you don't make me do this too often
14:29 - all right
14:30 - and then lastly when the letter c shows
14:33 - uh
14:34 - [Music]
14:35 - we've done a clap in a floss shall we
14:37 - make the third one just be a dab
14:40 - yeah
14:42 - all right
14:43 - so we're gonna have
14:45 - here's our code
14:47 - when the a shows
14:49 - clap
14:51 - when the b shows
14:53 - floss
14:55 - and when the c shows dab all right i'm
14:58 - gonna get my code ready
15:01 - so i don't forget what these commands
15:03 - are
15:05 - and sophia is gonna
15:08 - and if you're watching at home and the
15:10 - students who are younger you can follow
15:12 - along with sophia yourselves
15:14 - to get up a little bit to get moving a
15:16 - bit
15:17 - um and sophia you hit this play button
15:19 - to start the music
15:21 - right is everybody ready and sophia is
15:23 - going to show the letters and i'm going
15:24 - to quickly do
15:27 - a is clap b as floss c is dab
15:32 - right you're so tall
15:35 - ready sofia yes
15:43 - [Music]
16:00 - go
16:05 - [Music]
16:15 - [Music]
16:24 - right so that was a little bit of
16:25 - exercise for me but what we're going to
16:26 - do next is show how you can actually do
16:28 - this
16:29 - on a computer using coding and sophia is
16:31 - going to do the coding this time yes
16:33 - sure okay
16:35 - so i'm gonna go into the code.org dance
16:37 - party
16:39 - so we're gonna share our screen again
16:42 - here's the code.org dance party
16:46 - and so let's do the same code that we
16:48 - were just doing uh but using
16:51 - i mean basically the same dance so that
16:53 - everybody helped us decide so why don't
16:56 - you first
16:58 - create a world and choose a world
16:59 - background
17:06 - should we ask our audience what
17:07 - background to use
17:10 - so choose from the different backgrounds
17:12 - should we do a firework or a laser dance
17:14 - floor
17:21 - um
17:22 - let's do the laser dance floor
17:24 - oh somebody said neon disco choose neon
17:26 - disco
17:29 - disco ball
17:31 - all right now put a dancer in the middle
17:39 - and you probably wanted to be a cat
17:40 - because you love cats
17:43 - okay
17:44 - well and you want to put some dancers in
17:46 - the all around it as well so make a
17:48 - group of dancers you can make it be a
17:49 - cat because i know you love cats
17:53 - and then make like
17:55 - 20 of something else
17:59 - 20
18:00 - and let's ask the audience what we want
18:02 - this one to be so should these be dogs
18:04 - or ducks or pineapples or robots
18:08 - somebody said aliens
18:10 - let's go aliens
18:12 - okay aliens aliens is i think pretty
18:15 - popular
18:16 - all right
18:17 - um
18:18 - and then what do we want these these
18:20 - dancers are going to do different stuff
18:21 - when we hit the keys so see where it
18:23 - says events and that's what we were
18:25 - learning about is events
18:28 - so click
18:29 - choose when the up arrow key is pressed
18:31 - but instead of the up key click
18:34 - and choose the letter a
18:37 - and for letter a we're going to do a
18:38 - clap
18:39 - i don't remember what they are you'll
18:40 - need to look it up okay okay so now go
18:43 - into the dancers and make everybody do a
18:45 - clap
18:51 - and then choose you can
18:54 - say when the b letter is pressed
18:56 - what's the b again
18:59 - b is false
19:06 - yep okay
19:07 - i always mix these
19:09 - up
19:10 - okay last one and then the last one
19:13 - when a c is pressed
19:20 - and have it do dab forever
19:27 - all right so you're going to use the
19:28 - little keyboard
19:30 - to make the dance work and for the song
19:32 - we have this thing here the ode to code
19:35 - we could choose all sorts of songs here
19:37 - uh
19:38 - but because it's eu code week we have
19:40 - the ode to code song that's been written
19:42 - for eu code week
19:44 - all right are you ready for this and
19:45 - sophia you're gonna man the keyboard
19:48 - ready and so you're gonna do a b and c
19:55 - [Applause]
19:55 - [Music]
19:57 - you want to shout out as you're doing
20:04 - [Music]
20:06 - hey
20:08 - and can you do it faster like um
20:13 - [Music]
20:26 - [Music]
20:32 - okay all right
20:33 - so we could do lots and lots of
20:35 - different things
20:36 - somebody said stop for a second it's
20:38 - laggy for me but there's all sorts of
20:40 - different dances you can make this much
20:42 - much more complicated with different key
20:43 - presses and different moves
20:45 - and then this too you can also once
20:47 - you've finished your dance you can also
20:49 - send it to your phone
20:51 - as well
20:53 - but i want to now switch gears and do
20:55 - something a lot more complicated we're
20:56 - going to actually make our own little
20:58 - app and this is also going to use events
21:02 - so we're jumping into code.org's app lab
21:05 - if you're in elementary school you'll
21:06 - still be able to follow along but the
21:08 - coding we're doing even though it's drag
21:10 - and drop
21:11 - is going to be in a programming language
21:13 - called javascript so maybe a little bit
21:15 - harder to follow along but then we're
21:17 - going to jump into something easy
21:18 - afterwards again so don't lose us
21:21 - um so the app that i want to make is an
21:23 - image tutorial you know in apps like
21:25 - instagram or snapchat if you take photos
21:28 - you can basically
21:29 - draw on your photo we want to make an
21:31 - app like that so you can draw uh
21:34 - we're gonna have you pick a photo that
21:35 - you draw on as well
21:38 - so
21:38 - um
21:39 - so we're gonna have you pick a photo
21:42 - from here
21:44 - we're gonna go so here's app lab and
21:46 - here you have we're gonna be able to
21:48 - design our app in design mode and then
21:50 - write the code for it
21:52 - so the first thing we wanna do is drag
21:54 - an image
21:56 - that is the image that our app is gonna
21:57 - have that's kind of important
22:00 - yes
22:02 - and for the image
22:04 - we're gonna choose
22:05 - a cat
22:08 - this cat
22:11 - which is sophia's cat and i didn't have
22:13 - sunny so this is our previous cat
22:15 - right so here's our little cat and we
22:17 - want to write the code so that sophia
22:19 - can doodle on this cat
22:21 - and draw all over it
22:26 - all right sophia are you ready
22:28 - yes
22:29 - so what we want to do is make it so that
22:31 - any time the mouse moves you're drawing
22:34 - so can you drag an on event block from
22:37 - over there
22:43 - and say on events that on the screen you
22:46 - see a mouse move event
22:48 - so on the screen when you get a mouse
22:50 - move
22:51 - event
22:53 - and then we want to move and draw to
22:55 - that location so go into the turtle
22:57 - drawing commands
22:59 - and say move to
23:05 - but instead of moving to zero zero we're
23:07 - going to move to event dot
23:10 - x
23:12 - and event dot y
23:14 - and that's the location that the mouse
23:16 - move event brought us to so now click
23:18 - run
23:19 - and then move around oops click run
23:21 - again
23:25 - oops we have an error hold on
23:29 - i need to put a little event here
23:32 - okay try it again
23:38 - and so the as you're moving the turtle
23:40 - is moving but it's not drawing anything
23:42 - so how do we get it to draw
23:45 - now we're doing something called
23:46 - debugging
23:47 - this is basically a bug that we found in
23:50 - our code
23:52 - that i drew yes sophia drew this little
23:54 - ladybug so hit the reset button
23:57 - so the problem is that the turtle isn't
23:59 - drawing at all because his pen isn't
24:01 - down so what we need to do
24:03 - is drag this pen down command to the
24:06 - very front and the very top of your code
24:11 - and while we're there let's check the
24:12 - pen color so make the pen color
24:17 - white
24:19 - yeah you can click there and choose the
24:21 - color for it
24:23 - oh no you can't
24:24 - i'll i'll type it in
24:26 - we'll make it a white pen
24:29 - and do you want to choose the pen width
24:30 - as well sure
24:35 - and we'll make that five
24:37 - okay now hit run
24:43 - so
24:43 - is it drawing i don't think so
24:49 - that dad i have perfectly good way i can
24:52 - see it's not dry it's not drying
24:57 - hmm
24:59 - do you need to do the pen color before
25:03 - no no this is correct
25:05 - i'm only wondering if it's not drawing
25:07 - on the image because it's drawing
25:10 - on the screen ahead of it i think we
25:12 - need to
25:18 - let's go to design mode
25:21 - and hit run again
25:23 - oh it is drawing
25:26 - all right so i'm just going to get rid
25:27 - of the cat so we write the code without
25:28 - the cat behind it
25:30 - okay
25:31 - so you're doing this image doodling
25:34 - so
25:35 - let me change this green color though so
25:37 - we'll we'll debug that later but for now
25:39 - all we're going to do is is continue
25:42 - doing this code so hit the run button
25:43 - one of the problems
25:44 - right now is as you're moving around can
25:47 - you stop the drawing
25:49 - i don't think no it's drawing all the
25:51 - time the reason is right now it's always
25:54 - the pen is down remember how we said pen
25:56 - down so we need to have the pen
25:58 - sometimes be down and sometimes be up
26:01 - maybe when you're clicking okay so hit
26:02 - reset we can use other events remember
26:05 - we're learning about events all right so
26:07 - click out go into ui controls
26:10 - and choose on event it's at the top
26:16 - on events so we want to figure out that
26:17 - when the mouse is down the pen should be
26:20 - down
26:21 - so in the screen
26:24 - gets a mouse down event
26:27 - then
26:28 - say
26:30 - pen down go to turtle
26:33 - pen down
26:38 - and also let's also make a move to
26:40 - command right here as well so we'll say
26:43 - move to
26:45 - and over here event dot x
26:47 - and events dot y what about the pen down
26:50 - at the top of the screen
26:52 - oh you don't want it to this one you
26:54 - mean yeah you want it to no longer start
26:56 - with the pen being down how should it
26:58 - start
26:59 - pin up let's start with the pen up
27:03 - okay
27:04 - so now what's this going to do
27:06 - hit run and see what happens
27:10 - yay so now it's not drawing until you
27:12 - click
27:13 - now can you stop
27:15 - wait it's not stopping the drawing stop
27:17 - the drawing you want to make a smiley
27:19 - face okay so you can't do it because now
27:21 - we did what we said when the mouse goes
27:23 - down but we didn't do anything when the
27:24 - mouse goes up so now go to ui controls
27:28 - and then say on event
27:32 - screen one
27:34 - thus up
27:36 - i think
27:37 - yep that's a good guess when the screen
27:39 - has a mouse up event
27:41 - what should we do
27:43 - you don't need that okay
27:46 - maybe
27:48 - and up
27:50 - yeah
27:51 - all right so now i think you have a full
27:53 - image doodler
27:57 - so now you can draw whatever you want
27:59 - lift the mouse up
28:02 - yay so do you want to add some more
28:04 - stuff to this image doodler to make it
28:06 - slightly more powerful
28:08 - okay stop
28:09 - let's let's add some stuff because this
28:11 - is kind of simplistic but the other
28:13 - thing is see this little triangle that's
28:15 - moving around with us that's the little
28:16 - turtle
28:17 - and we can have him hide so we don't see
28:20 - him as we're writing our code
28:22 - so basically there's a hide command
28:25 - to hide the turtle
28:27 - but what i want to do is add some
28:28 - buttons to basically let you choose the
28:31 - color so click design to move to the
28:33 - design mode
28:35 - and drag a few buttons to either the
28:38 - bottom of the top of the screen maybe
28:39 - three three buttons
28:44 - you're not gonna be perfect
28:47 - they don't need to be perfect
28:51 - okay move them around a little bit okay
28:53 - okay let's name these different buttons
28:56 - after different colors and let's ask the
28:58 - audience what colors should we use for
29:00 - the first button
29:03 - we can choose red green blue wow
29:06 - everybody's choosing red
29:08 - so red
29:10 - okay so the first button is red
29:12 - and we can even choose the color of this
29:14 - button
29:15 - to be red
29:17 - is that kind of reddish it's like an
29:19 - orange artist but it does it's close
29:21 - enough right what color should we make
29:23 - the next button
29:26 - blue green yellow
29:30 - blue
29:31 - what somebody said violet
29:34 - blue and green let's let's do the next
29:36 - two buttons blue and green so this one
29:38 - is going to be blue
29:42 - and then this one
29:44 - the text of it will make green
29:48 - and so if you want to help me choose
29:50 - green
29:56 - that's good all right that's good red
29:58 - blue and green are our buttons so how do
30:01 - we make the code so that depending on
30:03 - which button we press the color changes
30:06 - will be another event we need to use
30:08 - events that's right
30:10 - so
30:11 - go into ui controls again
30:13 - and then say on event
30:16 - and now we need to choose when the
30:18 - buttons are clicked
30:20 - so
30:20 - on event where the button is clicked
30:23 - which button
30:24 - i think button four
30:26 - how do you know just pick button four
30:28 - and then hover over them to see what
30:30 - they are that one's button four that
30:32 - one's button five thousand six so when
30:33 - button four is clicked
30:35 - what should we do
30:37 - go into the turtle again let me change
30:39 - the pen color yeah scroll down and see
30:42 - where it says pen color
30:46 - and it's already set to red okay
30:48 - and then now bring another ui event on
30:51 - event
30:58 - and instead of id you want to choose
31:00 - button five
31:03 - and then oh no that's that's correct
31:05 - okay and then you want to do a turtle
31:06 - command
31:09 - and choose the pen color
31:12 - blue
31:13 - click on the red you do
31:16 - all right
31:17 - and then last last one for green
31:20 - you're way ahead of me now
31:26 - there we go turtle no don't forget to
31:29 - choose the id for your button we still
31:31 - have the turtle
31:35 - issac called turtle by the way you
31:36 - always want to know why is it called
31:38 - turtle yeah that is a great question
31:41 - like python or something
31:43 - no python is internal or differently
31:45 - named by different people a long time
31:47 - ago there's a
31:49 - basically an mit turtle drawing
31:52 - was started out early on it actually was
31:53 - a little turtle that moved around on the
31:55 - screen so you could see it moving and
31:57 - you could give it command
31:59 - oh
32:00 - right so now you hit the run button
32:05 - can you choose the different colors
32:07 - click to make different colors
32:09 - so now you make blue
32:12 - now you may choose green
32:15 - and you can choose red
32:20 - now you can draw all sorts of stuff
32:22 - so
32:23 - do you want to also let you change it to
32:25 - make it a thick brush or a thin brush
32:27 - sure this is also one of the fun things
32:29 - you could do so go back into design mode
32:32 - and like
32:33 - and pick a slider see that slider
32:37 - put a slider at the top of the screen
32:40 - and
32:41 - we need to choose what the slider goes
32:43 - from what to what right now it goes from
32:44 - zero to 100 let's make it go from like
32:47 - one
32:48 - to
32:49 - one thousand
32:51 - fifteen yeah
32:53 - okay so it goes from one to fifteen so
32:56 - now this is also really easy to do we'll
32:58 - basically make it so this slider chooses
33:00 - our pen width okay
33:03 - so drag another on events
33:07 - blocks how many
33:11 - we're using events all throughout this
33:13 - lesson
33:15 - that's good
33:16 - and then on event
33:17 - choose the slider
33:20 - it's called it's slider one
33:27 - and the event this isn't a click event
33:29 - it's a change event
33:31 - so when the slider changes
33:33 - what we're going to get
33:35 - is now we want to change the width so go
33:38 - to turtle
33:42 - and when you what what you want to do is
33:44 - pen width
33:48 - but the width we're going to need to do
33:50 - it's not like the number three we we
33:52 - need to know what's in the value of the
33:53 - slider
33:54 - so the way you're gonna need to do this
33:58 - is go into ui controls
34:01 - and get the text
34:04 - of what's inside the slider
34:07 - so instead of setting the width to three
34:09 - we'll get the number that's in the
34:10 - slider
34:11 - so now hit run
34:18 - change the slider
34:22 - it looks slightly the same
34:24 - and now it's thin
34:26 - now it's super tight okay wanna make a
34:27 - big red thick thread line
34:32 - yeah it's a thick red line
34:35 - yeah
34:37 - you can i bet you wanted the slider to
34:39 - make even thicker lines didn't you
34:42 - do you want to show how to make really
34:43 - thick lines go to go into design mode
34:45 - and change what the slider can do so
34:48 - right now
34:49 - the slider was going the minimum values
34:52 - from 1 to 15 where would you want it to
34:54 - be
34:57 - 50
34:58 - okay
35:00 - you're going to break it one of the fun
35:02 - things about coding is trying to break
35:03 - the computer
35:08 - so that's a small slider
35:11 - you would do red red and thick okay
35:14 - behold
35:16 - oh
35:17 - super thick line
35:21 - all right so let's finish off with this
35:23 - um
35:24 - can you show our audience how to share
35:26 - this so that i can get it onto our phone
35:27 - and so we can do this right here maybe
35:30 - the share button click the share button
35:32 - and then hit send to phone
35:34 - and any of you if you have a phone all
35:36 - you need to do is then
35:38 - scan the qr code that shows up on the
35:40 - screen
35:40 - and open it
35:47 - and i'm now going to stop the share and
35:49 - show you this app that we made
35:51 - basically has everything we just did
35:54 - in an app so i can hit the blue
35:56 - and make it small
36:00 - it's kind of hard to show an app while
36:01 - using it on the screen but basically the
36:04 - app that we made is now something we
36:05 - have on our screen as well it's the qr
36:07 - code
36:09 - i went too fast all right so now let's
36:11 - move to our third and last section of
36:14 - today's lesson what we're going to learn
36:16 - about is something super important
36:19 - called artificial intelligence
36:21 - and artificial intelligence is something
36:24 - that's being used everywhere around the
36:26 - world we're not going to be coding the
36:28 - ai right now we're going to be doing
36:30 - what's called training so artificial
36:32 - intelligence means like when computers
36:34 - are like magically smart
36:37 - but we're going to learn about a
36:38 - specific type of artificial intelligence
36:40 - called machine learning and what machine
36:42 - learning is is a computer basically is
36:46 - learning from what we tell it whatever
36:48 - we tell it it learns and so
36:51 - the training we provided is very similar
36:53 - to writing code but instead of
36:56 - writing in code we're just giving it
36:58 - data and when the computer sees enough
37:00 - data it learns we're going to start this
37:03 - with something really simple to using
37:06 - code.org to teach the computer the
37:08 - difference between fish and garbage and
37:11 - this is something that we could use
37:12 - later for having computers learn how to
37:14 - clean our oceans and this is actually
37:16 - important because lots of things like
37:18 - problems like cleaning the ocean and
37:20 - many other world problems are problems
37:22 - that we're going to need machine
37:23 - learning and artificial intelligence to
37:25 - solve
37:27 - so i'm going to share our screen
37:29 - and this is going to be
37:32 - using the code.org ai for ocean's
37:34 - tutorial okay is the fork are you ready
37:38 - so what we want to do right now is we're
37:40 - going to be training the computer and
37:42 - training the ai um so this says is this
37:45 - a fish sophia do you want to do that or
37:47 - do you want to call it out
37:48 - worth it but there's two ways to do this
37:51 - you can do the funny way and just make
37:53 - everything you want the opposite no
37:55 - let's train the ai properly let's say
37:57 - this is not a fish
37:58 - is this a fish yes yes is that a fish
38:02 - yes is that a fish no
38:04 - is that a fish no
38:07 - so you're helping it by training it
38:08 - that's that's a fish
38:10 - that's not a fish
38:12 - that's a fish
38:14 - not a fish right so we've given it 12
38:17 - pieces of data
38:18 - so far we're training it each time we
38:21 - show it something it can tell the
38:22 - difference between fish and not a fish
38:24 - do you think that's enough data stop
38:26 - stop stop stop stop now let's see if
38:28 - that's enough for ai to tell the
38:30 - difference between fish and garbage hit
38:32 - run
38:34 - and see it's detected
38:36 - wait a second that's not a fish that's a
38:38 - fish
38:39 - that see it's doing a good job
38:41 - it's figured it out
38:43 - yes
38:44 - wait
38:45 - it doesn't know how to recognize apple
38:47 - cores as not being fish newest fish
38:49 - species apples
38:52 - wait
38:53 - wait
38:54 - so if we finish this ai also once we've
38:57 - trained it it can move super fast and if
39:00 - we continue we can see
39:02 - all the things that it chose were fish
39:05 - and it got lots of things right but got
39:07 - some of them wrong now click into the
39:09 - little knot area to see
39:11 - these are all the things it recognizes
39:16 - so if we wanted to help ai do better you
39:18 - would click train more because it didn't
39:20 - have enough data but hold on hold on
39:23 - hold on but i want to show something
39:24 - different let's train ai to do something
39:27 - to learn something that it doesn't know
39:29 - that we don't even know what it is let's
39:31 - have it decide
39:32 - a word to teach like basically we can
39:35 - teach a new word to the ai we can teach
39:37 - it to recognize fish that are fierce or
39:40 - spooky or delicious or wild
39:44 - so why don't we ask the audience what
39:46 - word we should teach our fish
39:48 - somebody says angry
39:50 - angry fish fish
39:53 - wild fish glitchy fish
39:56 - silly fish
39:58 - all right let's choose between
40:01 - okay lots of people said angry let's
40:03 - choose angry fish
40:05 - i like angry birds also but we're going
40:07 - to choose
40:08 - so hold on let's decide are you going to
40:10 - decide or am i going to decide because
40:11 - now it really matters because it's an
40:13 - opinion
40:14 - because before one of those fish or
40:16 - trash you'll do rock paper scissors
40:18 - paper scissors shoot okay you get to the
40:21 - side
40:22 - all right is that fish angry
40:25 - i don't think it's angry okay so not
40:27 - angry how about that one no
40:31 - that one looks angry
40:33 - but it's your opinion i think it looks
40:35 - very
40:41 - it's got like angry eyes with a happy
40:43 - face so i don't know
40:45 - i don't think he's angry you're gonna
40:46 - say it's angry
40:48 - that one's definitely angry this one's
40:50 - sort of angry
40:52 - i'm sad more fish
40:57 - all right go a little faster as you're
40:58 - choosing these
41:02 - i'm just so angry
41:03 - is that guy's angry
41:07 - that one's definitely angry because no
41:09 - no the one you chose oh okay so you're
41:12 - basically not choosing whatever you want
41:14 - and what's important to note here is you
41:16 - might not think that sofia is coding but
41:18 - she's kind of doing the equivalent of
41:20 - coding with machine learning
41:22 - the data that you give ai is the code
41:26 - and the ai is learning from sofia what's
41:28 - angry and what's not angry and what's
41:30 - really important here is that every time
41:32 - sophia is making this decision between
41:34 - not angry and angry she's giving an
41:36 - opinion it's her opinion of what what
41:39 - angry looks like and that opinion is
41:41 - being used to train the computer and we
41:44 - should think when we do this when ai is
41:46 - being trained by a human opinion
41:48 - if she has the wrong opinion
41:50 - she gets to decide and the ai can learn
41:53 - something good or bad because she's the
41:54 - one doing the training
41:56 - this is really relevant because computer
41:58 - systems when they're when you train ai
42:00 - they're not necessarily getting it right
42:02 - or wrong they're just mirroring and
42:04 - repeating
42:05 - the training we give them if the data
42:07 - that we use to train them has some kind
42:10 - of bias
42:11 - for example if she thought that was
42:12 - angry then it would learn wrong
42:15 - the other thing is it's only learning
42:17 - from the fish that we see here so if
42:20 - once we train this it may not work on
42:22 - other types of fish because we're only
42:23 - given a limited set of fish all right so
42:25 - if you hit the continue button so we can
42:27 - see
42:28 - two so now we trained 60 fish and now we
42:32 - can run and have the ai
42:35 - see how well it learned
42:39 - that one's definitely angry wait
42:42 - it's
42:44 - so it's doing okay but i would say not
42:47 - perfect
42:48 - so can you speed it up
42:54 - okay i got some what does that oh i'm
42:56 - angry so let's hit continue to see all
42:59 - the fish that it determines that are
43:01 - angry and sad
43:03 - so some of these so now what's cool is
43:06 - we can actually find out why it thought
43:08 - something was angry it stopped this was
43:10 - angry because of its mouth
43:13 - and because of its tail
43:15 - click on one of the other ones and we
43:16 - can see why he thinks it's angry that
43:18 - one because of its eyes and its mouth
43:21 - let's see that one now that one also its
43:24 - eyes and its mouth
43:27 - that one its eyes and for some reason it
43:28 - thinks that dorsal fin is angry why do i
43:31 - think this one is angry
43:36 - okay the eyes
43:37 - uh you thought the sort of black eyes
43:39 - are angry they're
43:41 - kind of cute
43:43 - so you can find out for all the things
43:45 - the reason why hey i thought something
43:48 - i personally think the eyes are the top
43:50 - thing that shows when it's angry but
43:52 - basically since you fed it with those
43:53 - opinions that's what it's going to go
43:54 - for yeah don't judge a fish by its cover
43:58 - yeah don't it's generally not good to
44:00 - judge a book by its cover or a fish and
44:03 - this by the way is actually pretty
44:05 - relevant because computer scientists are
44:07 - doing some kind of weird things with
44:09 - machine learning so if you did you know
44:11 - that there's this is going to kind of
44:13 - bother you there's people that are
44:14 - already using machine learning
44:16 - to look at somebody's face
44:18 - and decide whether that person is
44:20 - trustworthy or not
44:22 - whether you can trust them or not just
44:24 - by seeing a photo of them and they're
44:26 - training
44:27 - machine learning just by giving it
44:29 - pictures and saying that that person's
44:31 - trustworthy that person is not
44:33 - trustworthy is it fair to judge whether
44:36 - somebody is trustworthy or not just by
44:38 - looking at their face
44:39 - no it's kind of not fair like imagine if
44:42 - a computer decided whether you should be
44:44 - allowed whether you should get a job or
44:46 - not based on what your face looks like
44:48 - that's not okay uh and
44:51 - the reality is the computer doesn't know
44:53 - what is okay or not it doesn't know
44:54 - what's ethical or not ethical it's the
44:56 - person who's training that ai who needs
44:58 - to decide is this actually a good thing
45:00 - to train a computer to do and so if
45:02 - you're training a computer to decide if
45:04 - somebody if you can trust somebody based
45:06 - on how they look that's kind of a bad
45:08 - thing we teach our children don't you
45:10 - know judge people by their looks so we
45:12 - should also teach your computers the
45:14 - same thing as well
45:16 - all right so i have one last thing to
45:17 - show with ai since we taught uh
45:20 - since we talked to the computer how to
45:22 - recognize angry or sad fish we're also
45:25 - gonna teach uh using basically computer
45:28 - vision
45:29 - how to recognize angry versus sad
45:31 - emotions
45:33 - so um and i'm going to be the one doing
45:35 - this because last time we did try this
45:36 - very bad ass showing my facial emotions
45:40 - literally okay so i'm going to first see
45:43 - uh sofia you're going to be the computer
45:45 - so you try to recognize my emotion
45:48 - what emotion is this
45:50 - i think that's happy
45:51 - what am i happy
45:53 - okay what emotion is this
45:56 - that's sad
45:58 - sad what emotion is this
46:03 - that's angry so now let's try something
46:05 - else i want to see if you can do it this
46:06 - way
46:09 - what emotion am i showing now
46:12 - happy
46:15 - that's a good guess you could tell just
46:16 - from looking at my eyes
46:18 - and what emotion am i showing now
46:22 - angry
46:23 - yeah
46:24 - now what emotion am i showing well i
46:26 - mean there's only one left so sad
46:30 - okay sad so the reason i showed that is
46:32 - you can tell my emotions just by looking
46:34 - at the upper part of my face
46:37 - and that's partly because you know me
46:38 - very well now let's see if we can train
46:41 - an ai to detect some of these things
46:45 - so
46:46 - i'm going to screen share again
46:50 - [Music]
46:52 - we're going to screen share in something
46:53 - called teachable machine this isn't on
46:56 - code.org
46:58 - but we're working at code.org building
47:00 - something similar as well teachable
47:01 - machine if you google it as this tool
47:04 - and what we're going to teach the ui of
47:06 - the ai is detect happy
47:09 - from
47:11 - sad sad too angry angry
47:15 - sleepy
47:17 - all right
47:18 - um and so if you come off the screen or
47:20 - i'll i'll the camera just point it let's
47:23 - do this part you're going to run away
47:24 - for a little bit so what we're going to
47:25 - do is teach the
47:27 - you can still be close so we can hear
47:29 - you
47:30 - all right so we're going to use the
47:31 - webcam
47:34 - and
47:35 - i'm going to show i'm going to train the
47:37 - ai what happy looks like so happy
47:44 - so that's my happy look
47:46 - then i'm gonna train the ai to see what
47:48 - sad looks like this is sad
47:50 - sad
47:54 - i'm giving it all these images i got 60
47:57 - examples of sad then lastly i'm going to
47:59 - show it what angry looks like
48:07 - that's angry all right so we gave it
48:09 - happy sad and angry and now we can hit
48:11 - click to train the model
48:14 - and now it's taking all these images
48:15 - that we gave it 26 happy images
48:18 - 60 sad images and 41 angry images
48:23 - and it's going to take a little bit of
48:24 - time to train sophia you can come and
48:26 - come and
48:27 - see what's going on right now so while
48:30 - this is training
48:34 - you were watching from afar um and you
48:36 - know why so what what i want to do is
48:38 - i'm gonna have it basically
48:40 - um let me screen share again i'm gonna
48:42 - have it try to recognize my emotions and
48:45 - then see if it can recognize your
48:46 - emotions
48:48 - see it's training basically it's going
48:50 - from counting from 1 to 50 using all the
48:53 - images that we gave it
48:59 - all right so if you can you step off
49:01 - screen again
49:03 - so now let's see
49:05 - what is it saying it's saying happy it
49:08 - sees down here that i'm happy now let's
49:10 - see if i change to sad will it recognize
49:14 - do you think it'll work for me
49:16 - you know
49:17 - how angry
49:20 - he recognizes angry for sure
49:23 - but sad
49:31 - can i try all right so it's basically
49:33 - looking at the webcam and detecting my
49:35 - emotions let's see if it knows any of
49:37 - your emotions
49:39 - okay ain't nothing on screen yet okay so
49:41 - now go happy
49:45 - angry
49:49 - it's just all sad basically it's the
49:52 - computer we trained it to see my
49:54 - emotions but when we have somebody else
49:55 - on screen it can't recognize at all do
49:58 - you know why it can't tell sofia no
50:01 - because we've trained it the very
50:02 - limited number of images we showed them
50:05 - only showed me in my face
50:07 - so
50:08 - as humans when you look at my face and
50:10 - your face you can tell what's going on
50:14 - and as humans when we see what you've
50:16 - learned what angry and sad looks like
50:18 - not only in my face but in all sorts of
50:20 - other people as well the computer we
50:22 - just gave it 60 images of each one thing
50:24 - and we only trained it on my my face so
50:27 - when we gave it your face it doesn't
50:28 - work this is also true in computer
50:30 - vision on all sorts of other things for
50:32 - example
50:33 - image recognition
50:35 - in general you can't just be trained on
50:37 - one set of people's faces you need to
50:40 - train it on people from different
50:42 - genders different races different
50:43 - ethnicities and this is kind of one of
50:45 - the problems with machine learning and
50:47 - computer vision is if you teach a
50:50 - computer to recognize faces that are
50:52 - white once they see faces that are
50:55 - black or brown they might not be as
50:57 - recognizable or asians
51:00 - and this isn't just a question of like
51:02 - does facebook know how to tag you in
51:04 - photos properly there's a number of
51:06 - reasons this is really important
51:08 - consider for example uh diagnosing of
51:11 - diseases the same computer vision that
51:13 - we did to show the teacher computer
51:15 - recognized happy from sad
51:17 - it's just looking we could have that
51:19 - look at teach a computer to look at
51:21 - x-rays and to detect
51:23 - sick from healthy or to look at
51:26 - mri scans and try to detect cancer cells
51:28 - from not cancer cells but if you do that
51:31 - you need to make sure that if you're
51:33 - going to use machine learning for
51:34 - diagnosing a disease it should work well
51:37 - across genders it would be bad if you
51:39 - only showed
51:40 - x-rays of male patients
51:42 - and then learned how to detect a disease
51:45 - but then the system doesn't work with
51:47 - women or if you did it only with people
51:50 - from one background like only white
51:52 - patients and then people who are uh
51:55 - indian or african the diagnosis doesn't
51:58 - work
51:59 - or maybe it does work but it's less
52:01 - accurate if it's slightly less accurate
52:03 - depending on your race is that fair no
52:05 - that's a tough question
52:07 - and there's so many ethical questions
52:10 - when you're basically coding an
52:12 - algorithm using data so you know when
52:14 - you're coding an algorithm with events
52:15 - like the dance you say when a do the dab
52:18 - it's it does exactly what you tell it
52:20 - but when you're coding it with data you
52:22 - need to figure out how much data is
52:24 - enough we didn't give it enough data to
52:26 - detect the fish from the trash and so
52:28 - the computer made mistakes and whether
52:30 - it's things like diagnosing diseases
52:33 - helping a car know how to avoid a
52:35 - pedestrian if it's going to be a
52:36 - self-driving car so it automatically
52:38 - hits the brakes all these types of
52:40 - things the data we give it to code the
52:42 - computer is very critical to make sure
52:44 - the computer is is and the algorithm
52:47 - is doing things ethically the way we
52:49 - want it to be
52:51 - all right we're at the end of our hours
52:52 - so we're going to get going now thank
52:54 - you so much to everybody from eu code
52:56 - week who joined us
52:57 - today we learned about events
53:01 - and we learned about
53:03 - algorithms algorithms
53:06 - and we learned about ai artificial
53:08 - intelligence and if you want to learn
53:10 - any of these things yourself you can go
53:13 - to code.org
53:16 - and all the exercises we did you can
53:18 - find over there as well
53:20 - so and there's lots of other fun things
53:22 - at code.org at home for example you can
53:24 - learn how to make your own star wars
53:26 - game and again share it to your phone
53:27 - and all sorts of stuff
53:29 - you also learned about my bug
53:31 - yeah
53:32 - we learned about sofia's bug so thank
53:34 - you everybody we're going to tune out
53:35 - now and enjoy the rest of your code week
53:37 - bye
53:42 - should we leave this camera on while
53:43 - everybody's saying goodbye i'm gonna
53:45 - click leave
53:46 - okay
54:54 - you
