00:04 - good morning if you are in Pacific time
00:07 - and good afternoon if you are not thank
00:10 - you for joining us today happy hour of
00:15 - code it's Wednesday so we're halfway
00:18 - through I think a lot of you have
00:19 - probably already gotten started if not
00:22 - welcome we're really excited that you
00:24 - were able to join us today and you

00:37 - looking for your questions we'd love to
00:39 - hear what's on your mind what are you
00:42 - thinking about how has your hour of code
00:45 - Computer Science Education week been
00:47 - going have you tried any artificial
00:50 - intelligence activities any questions
00:53 - about that please let us know you can do
00:55 - so in the zoom chat or go to bit.ly
00:57 - school question or scan this Q
01:00 - code I'll leave this up for a little bit
01:03 - in case you want to get that on your
01:06 - phones and I forgot to introduce myself
01:09 - I'm Miss Tanya nice to meet you all I
01:11 - work at c.org I'm a product marketing
01:14 - manager and I was also a software
01:16 - engineer so if you have any questions
01:18 - about what that's like being in
01:20 - education
01:22 - technology and being a non-software
01:24 - engineer in Tech let us know give us
01:27 - your
01:28 - questions we'll go ahead and get started
01:31 - so our very special guest today she is a
01:34 - curriculum writer on the K through 5
01:37 - team here at c.org so she creates the
01:39 - computer science curriculum for
01:40 - elementary schools and she's making new
01:43 - modules for CS connections integrating
01:45 - science and lab experiments into
01:48 - computer science and what's really
01:50 - special is she is the curriculum writer
01:53 - that helps create dance party AI Edition
01:56 - our brand new activity this year please
01:58 - join me in welcoming Emma wind
02:03 - green hi welcome Emma how are you doing
02:06 - I'm good thank you for that wonderful

02:16 - School curriculum um so I'm super
02:19 - excited today to show off something that
02:21 - I've been working on um along with some
02:24 - of the other curriculum developers and
02:27 - engineering and product team which is
02:28 - our new dance party AI Edition um and
02:32 - then in addition I have been working on
02:34 - our CS fundamentals course um some
02:37 - physical Computing with microbit
02:39 - activities and our CS connection so
02:42 - integrating different subjects like
02:44 - English math science into computer
02:48 - science awesome thank you Emma y'all are
02:50 - so lucky to have her she's gonna get
02:52 - started with walking us through creating
02:54 - her own dance party with dance party AI

02:58 - she does that if you you have questions
03:00 - let us
03:02 - know great okay I am going to go ahead
03:06 - and share my screen and hopefully you
03:10 - should be seeing the code.org homepage
03:13 - here so I got to this just by typing in
03:16 - code.org um if you are uh signed in it
03:20 - might look a little bit different I do
03:22 - recommend signing in so that all of your
03:24 - progress today will be saved and you can
03:26 - come back to it at any time um so so the
03:30 - hour of code is here our new dance party
03:33 - AI edition let's go ahead and click on
03:35 - see what's new and if we scroll down we
03:39 - will see um a button that says start
03:42 - dance party AI Edition so I'm going to
03:44 - go ahead and click on that and let's
03:47 - jump in all right so we are going to
03:51 - start with a little warmup introduction
03:54 - to what we'll be doing
03:58 - today
03:59 - [Music]
04:05 - hi my name is mural Cod and I'm a dancer
04:09 - software developer and creator of
04:13 - illuminate computer science relates to
04:16 - creativity in numerous ways immeasurable
04:19 - really I mean once you have the ability
04:21 - to write software you can put ideas into
04:24 - anything I do it with light suits
04:27 - there's so much you can do once you have
04:29 - the tools to write software and it's the
04:31 - possibilities are really
04:34 - endless over the next hour you're going
04:37 - to get started with computer science and
04:39 - artificial intelligence by coding your
04:41 - own dance party we've assembled some hip
04:44 - music and a team of great dancers for
04:46 - you to play
04:49 - with all right let's go ahead and jump
04:53 - in I'm going to scroll down here and
04:55 - click that orange continue
04:57 - button all right you will be ask asked
05:00 - your age go ahead and fill that out and
05:02 - then click okay and you should be
05:04 - brought to the first coding
05:06 - level um I am going to start up here it
05:09 - looks like we have some instructions so
05:13 - it says add blocks to create your dancer
05:16 - and code them to do a new dance move
05:18 - click run to start dancing and I even
05:21 - have a little call out here that tells
05:23 - me exactly where to start so it says
05:25 - start here with this red block O cool
05:29 - cat popped up and if I said if I decided
05:33 - I didn't really want the cat instead I
05:34 - wanted a sloth I have the option to
05:37 - change that from here um I am going to
05:41 - go ahead and click run to start
05:44 - [Applause]
05:45 - [Music]
05:49 - dancing o you need to add a block to
05:53 - make the dancer do a new move hm okay so
05:57 - I didn't add the new dance move block I
06:02 - am not quite sure what I need to do so
06:06 - I'm actually going to go and click on a
06:08 - hint so if I click on this light bulb
06:10 - here I have the option to get a hint a
06:14 - hint is telling me the dancer should be
06:17 - the same on both blocks and the sequence
06:19 - or order is important so if you're going
06:22 - through this tutorial at any point and
06:25 - you feel like you need a hint you can go
06:27 - ahead and click on this cat or the light
06:29 - bulb here so it seems like um I need
06:34 - another dance block so I need to
06:37 - actually have it do the dance
06:38 - move and before I click run I'm just
06:41 - going to preview what other songs I have
06:44 - so if I go up here to the top left I
06:47 - have my song that's preloaded and I'm
06:49 - going to see what other songs we have
06:51 - here oh okay I'm going to choose this
06:54 - Olivia Rodrigo song and I'm going to
06:56 - preview it using this play pause button
06:59 - good for you you look happy and Healy
07:03 - okay that sounds fun I am going to go
07:06 - ahead and click run I think I'm ready to
07:08 - try this level
07:09 - [Music]
07:11 - again
07:12 - [Music]
07:15 - Happ woohoo we did it all right when you
07:19 - complete the level you will see this
07:21 - message pop up go ahead and click
07:23 - continue and it will lead you to the
07:26 - next level and it looks like we have
07:28 - another video so this is an intro to AI
07:32 - video let's go ahead and check that
07:35 - [Music]
07:40 - out hi my name is hen and I'm head of
07:44 - the music search platform at Amazon I
07:47 - lead the team at Amazon music that helps
07:50 - you find your favorite songs we use
07:53 - Advanced computer technology like
07:55 - artificial intelligence to make sure
07:58 - when you need music recommendations we
08:00 - give you the perfect match artificial
08:03 - intelligence or AI is a computer program
08:06 - that works like human brains it takes a
08:09 - lot of data learns patterns from the
08:12 - data and makes decisions based on what
08:15 - it has learned AI is already being used
08:18 - in all sorts of ways all right let's go
08:22 - ahead and check out how we are going to
08:24 - use AI in our dance party project I'm
08:28 - going to that should make the screen a
08:31 - little bit easier to see all right so
08:34 - let's check out what our instructions
08:35 - are telling us to do AI can help you
08:38 - create fun visual effects for your dance
08:40 - party connect the AI generate effect
08:43 - block to setup click on the Block to get
08:45 - started all right so it looks like I'm
08:49 - going to take this block and connect it
08:54 - here and now again I'm going to check
08:57 - out my song list and see um if there are
09:01 - some songs that I would want my dancer
09:03 - to be dancing to and I see oh I love
09:06 - Lady Gaga let's preview this
09:11 - song all right let's go ahead and choose
09:14 - that song and now I'm thinking okay I
09:16 - want AI to generate effects that go with
09:19 - that song in particular I can click on
09:22 - this black box here and it will pop up
09:26 - with some different emojis okay it says
09:29 - choose three
09:31 - emojis I am going to
09:34 - choose um the crown Lady Gaga is a queen
09:38 - so choose a crown for her um I'm also
09:41 - going to choose I like this uh Emoji
09:44 - that's surrounded by Hearts this song to
09:47 - me is about self Lov so I feel like this
09:49 - Emoji really represents that I'm also
09:51 - seeing that when I click on it it's
09:53 - doing this cool thing where it like goes
09:54 - into the ai's brain kind of opens up and
09:58 - the Emoji jumps in and one more um so
10:03 - this song is kind of about growing up
10:06 - and this plant growing represents that
10:10 - to me so I'm going to click generate
10:12 - since I have my three
10:14 - emojis and AI is now finding the best
10:17 - effect for my Emojis let's see what it
10:21 - decides O Okay so that's what AI thinks
10:25 - is the best effect given the emojis that
10:28 - I chose and it generated the code for us
10:31 - so if we wanted to check out the code we
10:33 - could click up here where it says code
10:35 - and we can see okay set foreground
10:37 - effect to Hearts set background effect
10:39 - to roses and blooming petals and those
10:41 - are these effects right
10:43 - here I'm thinking that's not quite what
10:48 - I had in mind so I'm going to actually
10:50 - have the AI
10:51 - regenerate um some effects based on the
10:55 - same Emoji so I can click this
10:57 - regenerate button at the bottom left
11:07 - [Music]
11:09 - left all right so this is my new set of
11:13 - effects and I'm G to be honest I'm still
11:16 - not totally seeing what I had in mind
11:19 - but I think it's not um I don't think
11:22 - it's ai's fault I think it's I think
11:24 - it's on me I think I need to choose some
11:26 - different emojis here so I'm going to
11:29 - click this start over button and I'm
11:32 - going to actually choose different
11:34 - emojis um let's go ahead and choose this
11:38 - fits with the song I think um let's
11:40 - choose that disco ball and um I really I
11:45 - really did like that emoji with the
11:46 - heart so let's generate based on these
11:48 - new
11:56 - emojis Okay cool so this is an effect
11:59 - that I'm ready to use I'm going to go
12:01 - ahead and click use effect and those
12:04 - effects automatically pop up in my dance
12:06 - party which is really cool I'm gonna go
12:08 - ahead and click run and see my new
12:11 - dancer do this
12:22 - move all right so we passed this level
12:25 - I'm going to go ahead and click continue
12:27 - and level four is very similar to um
12:31 - level three you'll notice that there's a
12:34 - longer song list so we can choose one of
12:37 - these new songs I'm going to go with
12:39 - Beyonce and I'll do the same thing that
12:41 - I did before so I'll take this block and
12:45 - I'm going to choose three emojis that I
12:47 - think represent um the song Break My
12:50 - Soul and let's go with this fire Emoji
12:54 - some sparkles and this crown and have ai
12:58 - generate some effects based on those
13:07 - emojis oh that's a really fun one I like
13:10 - the stars that I like shooting out and
13:12 - if I wanted to see the code I can see oh
13:14 - that's called Starburst cool g to use
13:17 - that effect and go ahead and click
13:23 - run bu My Own Foundation yeah
13:30 - all
13:33 - right so now we have a video called how
13:36 - AI works so if you were wondering how AI
13:39 - was selecting those different effects
13:41 - this video will explain it so let's go
13:43 - ahead and check this
13:47 - [Music]
13:52 - out how do you think AI Works can it
13:56 - read your mind is it magic is it
13:59 - randomly
14:00 - guessing actually AI knows quite a lot
14:04 - AI looks at billions of data points and
14:06 - finds associations between words with
14:09 - some simple math concepts applied
14:12 - billions of times it calculates the
14:14 - strength between those
14:15 - associations then AI uses what it
14:19 - learned in order to make decisions on
14:21 - what to generate for
14:23 - you so I just want to um highlight
14:27 - something that was really cool that
14:29 - video which is that we can see the
14:31 - emojis that were chosen and the exact
14:35 - effects um that AI chose so black and
14:38 - white diamond and confetti were all were
14:41 - the effects that you can see here based
14:44 - on the Emojis so AI was making these
14:47 - decisions almost like it was Voting like
14:50 - AI was the one voting that and making
14:53 - its vote based on all of this data that
14:56 - it's seen before so let's go ahead and
15:00 - we are going to for you oops we are
15:04 - going to check out this next
15:09 - lle all right the instructions are
15:13 - saying AI gets you started you can
15:16 - customize the effect it creates click
15:18 - the emojis to try one of these so the
15:21 - regenerate AI will recommend a different
15:23 - effect based on the same Emoji so we
15:25 - already tried that one in the last level
15:28 - um use code use the code AI writes and
15:31 - customize it we haven't done that one
15:33 - and then start over choose three new
15:35 - emojis to generate a new effect so we've
15:37 - done that one too let's go ahead and
15:39 - figure out how this use code works so
15:42 - I'm going to click on these three emojis
15:47 - here and if you remember from before we
15:50 - can click on this code here to see what
15:53 - um the code looks like for the effects
15:55 - that AI chose and I actually have a
15:58 - different different button here that's
16:00 - available to me that's called use code
16:02 - so before I had a use effect button and
16:05 - now I have this use code button so I am
16:10 - going to go ahead and use my
16:13 - code
16:15 - and I can actually change some of these
16:19 - effects here so let's say instead of um
16:22 - set forr effect to Bubbles let's say I I
16:26 - kind of like that paint drip I thought
16:27 - that was kind of fun so I'm going to do
16:30 - that and customize it in that
16:40 - [Music]
16:42 - waying nice so now when you have that AI
16:47 - generate block you can use all three of
16:50 - those options uh regenerate start over
16:53 - or use code to customize your project
16:55 - even
16:57 - more
16:59 - let's check out this is a video that is
17:02 - going to explain how we can make our
17:03 - code even more
17:06 - [Music]
17:12 - interactive hi I'm Hannah and I'm a
17:14 - software engineer at code.org
17:16 - choreographers give dancers directions
17:18 - on exactly when to do a dance move in
17:20 - dance party you'll use code to direct
17:22 - your dancers to move when you want them
17:24 - to so how do you do this think of a
17:27 - situation where you do something like
17:29 - press a doorbell and then something else
17:31 - happens the doorbell rings when coding
17:33 - your dance party you can use events to
17:35 - make your program respond to a key you
17:37 - press so let's go ahead and try that
17:40 - out I am going to in this level we
17:44 - actually um don't need to add any code
17:47 - it's already on our screen so what we
17:49 - have to do is we have to press the arrow
17:52 - keys so when I
17:55 - press left key
18:00 - [Music]
18:06 - so I'm going to do that one more time
18:07 - just because that was a lot of fun I'm
18:08 - going to click replay and notice what
18:11 - happens when I click each of the arrow
18:13 - keys left and right I'll make this a
18:15 - little bit bigger so we can see
18:17 - it
18:20 - oops all right there we
18:23 - [Music]
18:27 - go
18:33 - so what's fun about that is I can
18:35 - actually choose to press the arrow keys
18:37 - whenever I want and my dancers will
18:40 - respond so if um you like that
18:43 - interactivity uh you can go ahead and
18:45 - click continue and then you'll have a
18:46 - chance to try it out on your own so
18:49 - let's see um what happens when we press
18:54 - up so we can go ahead and connect this
18:57 - new dance block here um I'm actually
19:01 - noticing that we uh don't have our
19:04 - effect so let's even add in this
19:06 - generate effect block let's listen to
19:08 - the song
19:10 - [Music]
19:12 - first all right so that's a little bit
19:15 - different than the songs we've heard
19:16 - before so let's go ahead and choose some
19:18 - emojis that represent that song I like
19:21 - um this plant Emoji for it and maybe
19:24 - kind of reminds me of like a summer day
19:26 - I'm going to choose this ice cream and
19:28 - then this uh Rose here so let's click
19:40 - [Music]
19:42 - generate all right so this is the effect
19:45 - that AI chose and something that I want
19:48 - to um look at is actually how AI made
19:52 - that decision so if you click on this
19:54 - button up here to learn more you'll
19:57 - actually see
19:58 - each of the
20:00 - effects that AI
20:02 - decided not such a good fit and then at
20:05 - the end is an effect a set of effects
20:08 - that matches the Emoji best so you can
20:11 - see AI is kind of voting here and um
20:16 - these Emoji colors match up to the
20:19 - number of votes here and this effect set
20:22 - of effects at the end got the most votes
20:25 - so that's what AI decided to choose all
20:28 - right let's use that effect and I have
20:30 - to remember that this event will work
20:33 - when I press the up key so I have to
20:35 - remember to press the up key during the
20:39 - [Music]
20:45 - song
20:47 - Awesome all right so in the next two
20:51 - levels uh you will learn how to use a
20:54 - different kind of event um that happens
20:56 - at a certain time in the s song um what
20:59 - I want to do is I want to skip ahead to
21:02 - level 10 and this is where we can
21:05 - actually build out a whole song So
21:09 - before um it was only playing the song
21:11 - for a couple measures and here it will
21:14 - actually play the entire song so you can
21:16 - build out a bit of a longer dance party
21:19 - and what's cool about this level is that
21:20 - it gives you some starter code so um you
21:24 - have already some dancers on your screen
21:26 - let's go ahead and click run and just to
21:28 - see what it looks like at the
21:31 - start
21:34 - [Music]
21:36 - R all right um something else that I'm
21:40 - seeing is that we have so many songs on
21:42 - this final free play level so we can
21:45 - choose um from a much longer list of
21:49 - songs here um let's go ahead and
21:56 - choose um let's do a good song for
21:59 - dancing let's choose dance monkey so
22:01 - let's go ahead and preview
22:03 - [Music]
22:07 - that and I can start adding in some of
22:10 - my different events so I like this um
22:13 - when up press through the key press
22:15 - events and I get to customize um my
22:19 - dance a little bit so when up pressed I
22:22 - want the
22:23 - Moose
22:25 - to do the star I'm not totally sure what
22:28 - the star is but we'll see what happens
22:30 - when I press up and then
22:33 - when let's do when down is pressed let's
22:41 - have
22:43 - our what are those the cats are the
22:46 - backup dancers let's have a cats do the
22:50 - drop and I'm actually going to
22:53 - choose this block instead so that the
22:57 - Moose only does it once each time we
22:59 - press up all right so now I'm going to
23:03 - go ahead and click run and press the up
23:05 - and down key to see my different dancers
23:09 - [Music]
23:16 - move there awesome so go ahead and try
23:21 - out all of those different levels and
23:23 - when you're ready you can go to level 10
23:26 - which is the free play level
23:28 - and set up a longer dance and get
23:31 - started um so I'll run this one more
23:34 - time and then I think that there are
23:37 - some questions from all of you before
23:39 - you oh oh I was just gonna say if your
23:43 - teacher gives you permission and you

25:42 - like me you had a lot of fun dancing to
25:45 - that uh thank you so much Emma for
25:48 - walking us through your dance party we
25:51 - do have some questions for you all right
25:54 - um let's start with from Sha High
25:58 - School uh Victor T asks what kind of
26:02 - questions can you ask the AI and how
26:05 - many questions at a time can you ask the
26:07 - AI oh that's a great question um so I I
26:13 - think that maybe the student is thinking
26:15 - about something like chat GPT or some
26:17 - sort of chat bot where you can type in
26:20 - questions to um an AI so far I haven't
26:25 - heard of a limit of questions that you
26:27 - can ask the AI um I mean sometimes there
26:30 - are constraints in terms of how much um
26:34 - space that the system can hold and how
26:37 - much memory but I think you know you can
26:39 - find a platform where you can ask the AI
26:41 - all of your questions um and the second
26:45 - part was what kind of yeah what kind of
26:48 - questions what kind of questions um so I
26:52 - think it really depends on what you're
26:53 - trying to um learn so I've heard of a AI
26:58 - that can help you answer um some
27:00 - questions that you might have with your
27:02 - math homework I have heard of different
27:05 - AI that can um create images for you or
27:08 - create videos for you uh this specific
27:12 - AI that we use um for our dance party AI
27:16 - Edition has been trained specifically on
27:19 - different types of effects and
27:21 - backgrounds and so it's kind of like
27:24 - behind the scenes we're asking hey if we
27:26 - give you these three emojis what effects
27:30 - do you think match up best to that so it
27:32 - really depends on um what you're trying
27:35 - to learn I
27:36 - think yeah and I would add on to that
27:39 - that it's also interesting to think
27:41 - about AI not as a search function or a
27:44 - way to search the internet for
27:46 - information but more of a tool that can
27:49 - help you do things so for example yeah
27:52 - with generative AI they helped you
27:54 - create an effect but uh when they're
27:56 - helping you with your homework work they
27:57 - can help you think through and ask you
27:59 - questions it might ask you questions to
28:01 - help you um figure out what how you want
28:03 - to write an essay or um yeah to finish a
28:08 - homework assignment so AI is meant to
28:10 - help us uh solve problems um and we do
28:14 - that by coding some artificial
28:17 - intelligence we have another question
28:18 - from Shan uh Shaw High School from
28:20 - Chanel B is coding hard is coding hard
28:24 - well hopefully after seeing the demo
28:26 - that I just did
28:28 - um you won't find it too hard um but I
28:32 - think that it really depends on how
28:35 - you're learning coding if you're ever
28:37 - feeling like coding is too hard I would
28:39 - say that is more indicative of maybe how
28:42 - you're learning it how you're being
28:44 - taught or what kind of platform you're
28:46 - using but above all I think coding
28:48 - should be fun and so if it's feeling
28:52 - like it's not super fun then maybe um
28:55 - that is kind of an indication of okay
28:57 - let's try out something else let's try
29:00 - out something that feels more fun let's
29:01 - try out an hour of code activity let's
29:03 - just try it for you know an hour um
29:06 - let's do something where we get to code
29:09 - uh images or someone moving across the
29:11 - screen or a maze um because I think
29:14 - oftentimes there are people who are
29:16 - discouraged from uh going into computer
29:19 - science because they feel like coding is
29:21 - hard um but I really don't think that it
29:23 - has to
29:25 - be and it just like anything else any
29:27 - other activity that you try let's say
29:29 - for example if you're trying Sports
29:30 - there's so many different of sports that
29:33 - you can play uh so there so many
29:35 - different ways to learn about coding and
29:38 - like Emma mentioned like sometimes you
29:40 - will make mistakes in the beginning you
29:42 - don't know how to throw a basketball
29:44 - with the right technique or to dodge a
29:47 - another ball coming at you like you you
29:50 - have to practice and and learn different
29:52 - skills and and grow that skill so uh
29:55 - keep trying it and and and trying
29:57 - different ways to see what what what's
30:00 - exciting and fun to you so thank you so
30:02 - much Emma for joining us thank you to
30:04 - all of you I hope you made a really fun
30:07 - dance party I would love to see what you
30:09 - created uh if you have permission from
30:11 - your parent or your teacher please post
30:13 - on social media and tag us with hash
30:15 - hourofcode maybe we'll repost you on
30:18 - code.org channels and I hope you all
30:21 - have a great hour of code week happy
30:25 - coding bye everybody thank you thank you
30:29 - Emma
