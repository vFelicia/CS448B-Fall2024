00:00 - One of the most important concepts in computer
science is how to define new commands. How
00:05 - to add your own words to a computer language.
Most computer languages have only about 100
00:11 - words or commands. And really, the art and
magic is in defining your own new words out
00:17 - of these building blocks. We do this all the
time in sports. For example, in basketball,
00:22 - you start by learning how to dribble, how
to do a layup, how to rebound. Once you've
00:28 - learned these really basic moves, you learn
new moves and put together these building
00:31 - blocks like a "pick and roll" or a "give and
go." You can then go from there to do more
00:36 - complex plays. And once you learn that play
and give it a name, everybody on the team
00:41 - knows how to do it. Similarly, once you've
taught a computer how to do an action once
00:47 - using this sequence of commands, you can make
up your own name for that action so it's easy
00:52 - to repeat it later. When you define your own
command and give it a name, that's called
00:58 - a function. When programming with blocks,
you would use functions if there are a set
01:03 - of actions you want to use lots of times.
For example, you've written code to create
01:08 - a square. You can define this as a function
called "create a square." Now you have a new
01:15 - block that you can use multiple times to create
multiple squares. A lot of simple shapes can
01:21 - be used to create more complex patterns. In
the next puzzle, the code you recently wrote
01:26 - to make a circle is available to you as a
new function that can make circles of different
01:31 - sizes. Can you use it to help Elsa create
intricate and beautiful patterns in the snow?
