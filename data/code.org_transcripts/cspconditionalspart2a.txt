00:01 - CONDITIONALS PART 2A
IF/ELSE STATEMENTS
00:04 - Our daily live are filled with decisions.
Big and small.
00:08 - Even simple choices like what to wear
00:11 - usually are the result of 
complex considerations.
00:14 - What's the weather going to be like?
00:16 - What will you be doing today?
00:18 - Do you feel like making an impression?
Or keeping it casual?
00:21 - But the world around us is constantly
changing, so we want to adapt the choices
00:26 - we make to match the changing conditions.
00:28 - What's true for humans is also true for
computer programs.
00:32 - We don't want our programs to always run
in the same way.
00:35 - They should respond to
changing conditions.
00:38 - In the last video, we learned how to use
boolean expressions to establish whether
00:43 - something is true or false.
We can now add something called a
00:47 - conditional statement to help guide the
computer's decision based on
00:50 - that information.
00:52 - The simplest conditional statement is an
if statement.
00:55 - It says that "If something is true", the
computer should run a specific
01:00 - block of code.
01:02 - Let's say that you want to create a
program that displays whether or not you
01:06 - are old enough to see a PG-13 movie.
01:08 - So the question we want the computer to
evaluate is
01:11 - "If age is greater than or equal to 13."
01:15 - The question or boolean expression goes
next to the if.
01:20 - The block of code we want to run, only if
the condition is true, goes inside the
01:24 - if statement.
01:27 - So in our example, whenever the expression
"age" greater than or equal to 13
01:31 - is true, the program will write to the
screen that you are old enough to see a
01:35 - PG-13 movie.
01:37 - Ofcourse some people will not be old
enough.
01:40 - In these kinds of situations, we will want
our programs to do something else when
01:44 - the condition is false.
01:46 - In order to do this, we will want to
expand our if statement to include an
01:51 - else statement.
01:52 - The commands contained in this else
statement only run if the boolean
01:56 - condition in the if statement is false.
02:00 - In App Lab you can add an else statement
by either draging out the if/else block or
02:05 - by clicking the "+" symbol in the bottom
right corner of the if block.
