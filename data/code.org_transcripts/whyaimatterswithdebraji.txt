00:00 - Over the years, 
I've come to realize how
00:03 - impactful and influential
00:05 - AI is as a technology.
00:07 - And it's so important 
to understand the
00:10 - different ways in which
00:12 - that technology works 
to make it less intimidating,
00:14 - to make it clear that it's
00:16 - a series of human decisions
00:17 - that we can control.
00:19 - Rather than this futuristic,
00:22 - sci-fi, uncontrollable thing
00:25 - that is out of reach
00:26 - in terms of us being able
to change it.
00:30 - Where do you think you're going?
00:31 - Well i'mnot going that way
00:34 - So i think that there's 
a lot of benefit,
00:36 - there's a lot 
to gain
00:38 - from involving yourself
00:40 - and really understanding 
the details of how
00:44 - this technology works. 
It's something that
00:47 - will influence your life
00:48 - and the life of everyone 
that you love
00:50 - and the life of everyone
00:52 - around you. 
And that's why I would
00:53 - encourage young people, especially,
00:56 - to - even if they don't 
want to be an engineer,
00:59 - and do it for the 
rest of their life -
01:01 - to really just properly 
engage in getting a
01:05 - sense, or an understanding, 
of the basics of what it means for
01:10 - the technology to work.
01:13 - If you're someone
01:14 - that cares passionately 
about people,
01:18 - and you have an interest
in computer science,
01:20 - the field definitely needs you.
01:23 - There's so much that
01:24 - we can learn from you,
01:26 - and learn from 
your empathy,
01:28 - and learn from 
your attention to the
01:30 - experiences of other people.
01:33 - We desperately need 
diverse perspectives in this field
01:38 - to shape a future vision for AI
01:42 - that is inclusive, that is impactful in
the right ways,
01:46 - and is attentive to the concerns of
01:50 - those that are most 
vulnerable in our society.
