00:08 - hi everyone and thanks for joining us
00:10 - today my name is leoland bowen and i'm
00:13 - an outreach manager on the education
00:15 - programs team here at code.org
00:17 - i've had the pleasure of speaking with a
00:19 - lot of amazing professionals during the
00:21 - cs journeys class chats this semester
00:24 - but today is a personal favorite today
00:26 - i'm speaking with genevieve johnson
00:28 - senior instructional designer for roblox
00:30 - an online game platform and game
00:33 - creation system that allows users to
00:35 - program games and play a game created by
00:37 - other users it is also one of my son's
00:40 - favorite game platforms i'm so excited
00:42 - to speak with her today about her
00:44 - experiences assisting in the creation of
00:46 - the roblox world hi genevieve
00:49 - hi leon
00:51 - so the first question i have is a very
00:53 - serious question that came from my 11
00:55 - year old son matheo who wants to know if
00:57 - you get paid in robux
01:00 - i do not
01:02 - so yeah sometimes
01:04 - if i want to make robux then i gotta go
01:06 - make my game and earn them just just
01:08 - like mateo
01:10 - i'm gonna be very disappointed to hear
01:11 - but thank you for sharing that
01:13 - so can you take a couple minutes to
01:15 - introduce yourself and your role at
01:16 - roblox
01:18 - so my name is genevieve johnson i am a
01:20 - senior instructional designer for roblox
01:22 - and what that means is i teach people
01:26 - how to teach people
01:27 - how to make games and experiences and
01:30 - all the different kinds of events that
01:32 - you see on roblox so that means i get to
01:34 - work with teachers like all like all
01:36 - across the world
01:37 - and i work with them to bring roblox
01:39 - into the classroom so students can do
01:41 - really really cool things
01:44 - perfect yeah and how does computer
01:45 - science um play in your career
01:48 - so i use computer science every single
01:51 - day so as i'm creating these new worlds
01:53 - and actually if you give me a second i
01:55 - can actually show you something
01:56 - um so i'm gonna go ahead and share my
01:58 - screen out
02:00 - so this is roblox studio and within
02:03 - roblox studio this is where all of the
02:05 - different worlds that you see and roblox
02:08 - are made like everything in roblox made
02:10 - right here roblox studio
02:12 - and within it
02:14 - if i want to take something that's maybe
02:17 - just a giant world like you know
02:18 - nothing's really particular happening
02:20 - like i've got this this island but i've
02:23 - got some pirate ships over there if i
02:25 - want to make those pirate ships shoot
02:27 - cannonballs or something like that then
02:29 - i could have to use code
02:31 - so i get to teach people how to both
02:33 - create the world and then also how to
02:35 - use code to make those worlds come
02:37 - really to life
02:41 - thank you that that's so cool
02:44 - like
02:45 - that's so fun to see the background
02:47 - about how that works thanks for sharing
02:50 - and before we go into the next question
02:52 - i just want to remind everyone who is
02:54 - watching that we will have time for
02:56 - questions throughout so if you have any
02:58 - questions please feel free to put them
02:59 - in the chat and we'll try to get to them
03:01 - all
03:02 - so can you tell us a little bit more
03:04 - about um a recent project you've worked
03:06 - on that you've really enjoyed
03:08 - okay so probably the thing that i am
03:10 - most proud of right now is that i just
03:12 - finished my second book and it's called
03:15 - coding of roblox lua in 24 hours
03:19 - so within that book i actually get to
03:21 - teach people from the very beginning how
03:23 - the code if you want to see a picture of
03:25 - the cover this is a picture of the cover
03:27 - right here coding with roblox lua in 24
03:29 - hours you can get it pretty much
03:31 - anywhere but i really take people from
03:33 - the start with what's a variable what's
03:36 - a string and then i take them all the
03:37 - way up to doing like really cool things
03:40 - so um somewhere back here i've got
03:43 - i've got a lot of files up i do a lot of
03:44 - work on a daily basis um so actually
03:47 - this is what i was looking for it said
03:48 - that like my favorite project in all of
03:50 - this is like actually not only like me
03:52 - getting to be creative but allowing the
03:54 - people who visit my world being creative
03:56 - so you can actually use code to allow
03:58 - your your visitors in your world to also
04:01 - place objects so like if they've got a
04:03 - house they can decorate it if they've
04:04 - got a garden they can put in flowers
04:06 - so stuff like that and it's all within
04:09 - that book everything from the very very
04:11 - beginning assuming that you've never
04:12 - touched code in your life
04:14 - all the way up to some very
04:15 - sophisticated topics
04:19 - and for the students who may not have
04:21 - heard of lua can you explain a little
04:23 - bit more about that what that is
04:25 - lua is a lot like python if you've ever
04:27 - used python so it is a text-based
04:30 - language
04:31 - um but there's a lot less to type than
04:33 - there is and maybe perhaps a lot of
04:35 - other different programming languages so
04:37 - if you've ever done java you're going to
04:38 - find there's a lot less typing but also
04:40 - if you've done something on the other
04:41 - side like scratch where maybe you've
04:43 - done some visual drag and drop coding
04:45 - you're going to find those concepts that
04:46 - you learned are still going to help you
04:48 - as you're learning a new programming
04:49 - language of lua
04:52 - perfect thank you
04:54 - and so can you tell us
04:56 - what kind of things do you like to do
04:58 - outside of work so i really believe in
05:01 - having a lot of hobbies and things like
05:03 - that
05:04 - uh i believe because i like making games
05:06 - i like making worlds and experiences um
05:08 - i like making stories so i i play a lot
05:11 - of video games for one so i think on my
05:14 - on my desk i've got just about every
05:16 - type of controller there is um
05:19 - and then i also do a lot of art so i've
05:21 - always been really big into art um
05:24 - and then i lift i go to the gym
05:27 - and i spend time with my little tortoise
05:29 - who i love so so dearly
05:31 - yay
05:33 - is it
05:36 - yeah so this is
05:39 - this is this is tenochtitlan we just
05:41 - call her nochi she is a three-year-old
05:44 - burmese star
05:46 - so she's absolutely in love with my life
05:49 - um
05:50 - so i spent a lot of time just finding
05:52 - flowers for her to eat and then feeding
05:54 - them to her
05:55 - and growing like i've thrown a whole
05:57 - garden for her basically so this is
05:59 - noche
06:00 - she's so cute thanks for sharing it
06:04 - yeah saying earlier she's not really a
06:06 - morning tortoise so i had to give her a
06:07 - nice warm bath you know it's like the
06:09 - equivalent of tortoise copy to like wake
06:11 - her up and be like all right what are we
06:12 - doing out this morning we're not doing
06:14 - things this early normally what's going
06:16 - on
06:17 - i love that yes i can relate to not
06:19 - being a morning person as i'm sure some
06:20 - of the students watching can as well
06:24 - um so my next question is when you were
06:26 - younger what did you want to be when you
06:28 - grew up
06:29 - so the first thing i wanted to be was a
06:31 - veterinarian um
06:32 - as you know i love animals like no tv
06:35 - and one example of how much i love
06:37 - animals and you know i really liked
06:38 - raising birds and and rabbits and all
06:42 - those kinds of things but then i kind of
06:43 - decided that that didn't work for me
06:45 - um
06:46 - so that's what i wanted when i was
06:47 - younger because i'm just so fascinated
06:49 - with science and like seeing like how
06:51 - animals and genetics could be bred for
06:53 - different things
06:54 - yeah so how did you
06:57 - end up in coding then because being a
06:58 - veterinarian and being a working in
07:01 - game design seems totally different
07:03 - how's that work yeah so it's kind of to
07:05 - me it's really sort of fascinating so i
07:07 - decided i didn't want to be a
07:08 - veterinarian um but i loved drawing
07:10 - animals i was always really fascinated
07:12 - by this a lot of the science behind like
07:14 - the way anatomy works
07:16 - uh so i kind of like started leaning
07:19 - more into
07:20 - like
07:21 - here i'll show you so this is this is a
07:23 - dragon that i i drew in in high school
07:26 - like i literally drew it in high school
07:28 - but as a kind of a lifelong passion it's
07:30 - always like how do dragons work they
07:31 - don't exist right like how do their
07:33 - wings work how do their legs work how
07:34 - does their tail like what's the anatomy
07:36 - that makes that work
07:37 - so kind of like
07:39 - through those questions um
07:41 - that's sort of like how it relates to
07:42 - like animals like so like having to
07:44 - study like bat wings or having to study
07:46 - like a lizard's tail or even like a
07:48 - horse's head to figure out how do i make
07:50 - these completely imaginary animals that
07:51 - don't exist
07:52 - and then uh one day
07:54 - this guy came into my classroom he was
07:56 - an old student of my art teacher he was
07:58 - working for
08:00 - uh the film industry making monsters so
08:02 - he like came in with like these giant
08:04 - clay
08:06 - busts you know like the head torsos and
08:08 - like of these like monsters like these
08:10 - like sort of predator looking monsters
08:11 - like you know that he'd been sculpting
08:13 - and he explained that this is what he
08:14 - did for a living and i was like that's
08:15 - what i want to do for a living
08:17 - and then from art to the so like i went
08:19 - i started to explore doing computer
08:21 - graphics because i was really into tech
08:23 - and animation turned out i didn't really
08:25 - care for modeling i computer modeling is
08:28 - like you make the the actual figure that
08:30 - you know people can then manipulate to
08:32 - animate in the world
08:33 - um because
08:35 - it just like wasn't alive enough for me
08:37 - so then i started exploring animation
08:39 - which i loved and that came back to that
08:40 - scientific observation how did things
08:42 - work
08:43 - and that led me eventually to game
08:45 - development um not only could i just
08:47 - like make this animal come to life i
08:49 - could make this whole entire world
08:51 - come to life i can make things that
08:53 - never existed and the more that i wanted
08:54 - to do the more i had to learn how to
08:56 - code the more i had to learn how to like
08:58 - get in there if i wanted that explosion
09:00 - if i wanted that dragon to fly i had to
09:02 - learn how to code to make that happen
09:06 - and so before i started working at
09:07 - code.org and i imagine this might be
09:09 - true for a lot of the students who are
09:11 - watching right now when i hear about
09:13 - someone who's a coder i think i have to
09:15 - be really really smart and i'd be really
09:17 - really good at math
09:19 - yeah
09:21 - yeah no no no no i am so bad at math uh
09:24 - i'm literally dyslexic so like i can
09:26 - understand how math works but then like
09:28 - the numbers just don't stay in place for
09:30 - me uh
09:31 - same thing you know like with reading
09:32 - like people but with code i really came
09:35 - at it because i'm more of an artistic
09:37 - person and i really
09:39 - love thinking about how things work
09:41 - uh so that's not true at all i would say
09:44 - you know even if you can't spell if
09:46 - you're not like a good writer there's
09:47 - autocorrect for code there's you know
09:49 - all these different engines that will
09:50 - help you like handle the code and how
09:52 - the logic works so i will say most of
09:54 - the engineers i know are actually very
09:57 - fun and creative zany people so that
09:59 - that sort of stereotype is yeah out
10:01 - there
10:02 - okay that's good to know yeah yeah yeah
10:05 - anyone can code i always tell people
10:06 - like it doesn't matter what you like you
10:08 - can read code like if you like music or
10:10 - football or you know any other sports or
10:12 - animals there's something that code can
10:14 - do to to um
10:16 - help your your interest out or to spread
10:19 - the word about it
10:21 - so i'm interested because you said a
10:23 - little bit ago that you love playing
10:25 - games so when i play roblox i love
10:27 - tycoon games i love being able to build
10:29 - i love seeing my money accumulate i love
10:32 - that that world of being able to build
10:33 - something within this game what type of
10:35 - games do you
10:36 - enjoy playing
10:38 - i really like actually i do like tycoons
10:41 - i find them really like soothing you
10:43 - just sort of like build something and
10:44 - you click a button and then you build
10:45 - something else
10:46 - um but i tend to like weird zany games
10:50 - and that's what i really love about
10:51 - roblox is like you'll have all of a
10:54 - sudden someone will make it like a world
10:55 - that's not even a game as we know it it
10:58 - might be
10:59 - this beautiful recreation of how ancient
11:02 - greek temple look like
11:04 - and you know so i'll go wander through
11:06 - it and just sort of like experience like
11:08 - the zen of that temple
11:11 - or like uh sometimes they'll be these
11:13 - story games where if you make a wrong
11:15 - choice the narrator will be kind of
11:16 - snarky and they'll make funny jokes
11:18 - uh and there's one there's one game that
11:20 - i i really really love called this is
11:22 - not a simulator game in a white box and
11:25 - if you if you like it'll give you these
11:27 - choices where you can be like oh you
11:29 - want to skip this or and then if you're
11:31 - if you snark back to the narrator it'll
11:32 - just kick you out of the game so i love
11:34 - really weird games i also love peaceful
11:36 - games and then like at home i play i
11:38 - play everything and i think that's kind
11:39 - of a good thing to do as a developer
11:41 - like play everything don't feel precious
11:43 - about like oh i'm into shooters and i'm
11:45 - into this and i like i can like fashion
11:47 - games and shooters
11:50 - yeah i think that's what makes the
11:51 - specific game platform so great is
11:53 - there's a variety of of games that uh
11:56 - people can play depending on what they
11:58 - like or maybe even what they like that
11:59 - day
12:00 - so thank you for sharing that
12:02 - yeah sometimes i'm like i just want to
12:03 - stroll through some woods and just sort
12:05 - of like look at pretty things
12:07 - exactly um
12:09 - and so along your way um to your career
12:12 - that you are now what kind of obstacles
12:13 - have you faced and um if any how have
12:16 - you gone about approaching them
12:19 - so probably i would say probably the
12:22 - biggest obstacle for me was when i was
12:24 - younger i didn't really know how i was
12:25 - going to go to college um so i was
12:28 - scared to even really try to go to
12:29 - college because i didn't know how my
12:30 - family was going to be able to afford
12:32 - that my older brother like
12:34 - he would have these sort of periods but
12:35 - even with a scholarship he would have to
12:37 - come back home for a while and then and
12:38 - then try again
12:40 - um
12:41 - so instead of like you know
12:43 - just giving up what i did is i you know
12:45 - as i was working in my retail jobs i
12:47 - just went to community college and i
12:49 - just took what i could in my art
12:51 - teachers there were really great as well
12:53 - as like my mom was really great you know
12:54 - everyone was like hey it doesn't really
12:55 - matter how long it takes you if there's
12:58 - this thing you want to do you got to
12:59 - keep working at it and doesn't you know
13:01 - don't judge yourself by what other
13:02 - people are doing so i went to community
13:03 - college for four years and then
13:05 - eventually i was able to get enough you
13:08 - know money together and might get my
13:09 - credit enough you know high enough up to
13:11 - to get a loan on my own to go to college
13:14 - and finish out the other two years but
13:16 - that also took me four years so it took
13:18 - me eight years to get to college um
13:20 - so that was probably i would say like
13:22 - the biggest thing obstacle that i've had
13:24 - in terms of my career is just like
13:26 - not getting impatient with the amount of
13:28 - time it was taking me to get to where i
13:30 - thought i should be
13:32 - yeah i i can imagine that be a struggle
13:35 - because we especially with college we
13:37 - hear that you're supposed to finish in
13:39 - four years so if it takes a little
13:40 - longer i can imagine that it could be a
13:42 - little um worrisome or frustrating so
13:44 - it's good to hear that you say that you
13:46 - kept working at it and you're here now
13:49 - yeah yeah that's it right
13:50 - yeah i mean you'll get there eventually
13:52 - uh you know life is both short and long
13:55 - so just keep working at it like you know
13:57 - and you'll you'll regret trying far less
13:59 - and you'll regret like not even trying
14:02 - yeah
14:03 - were there any people whether it's
14:05 - school or family or anything like that
14:07 - who've helped you along the way and how
14:09 - so you know there's so many people that
14:11 - helped me along the way like so a lot of
14:13 - teachers who knew that i was taking one
14:15 - or two classes while
14:16 - i would say working two jobs sometimes
14:18 - three jobs during like the holiday
14:20 - season
14:21 - um you know that were able to talk to me
14:23 - and and i say like talk if you are in
14:25 - tough situations talk to your teachers
14:27 - let them know what's up let your school
14:29 - officials know what's up at one point i
14:31 - was falling asleep on a couch and one of
14:32 - my school advisors was like just tell me
14:34 - and i'll come and wake up wake you up
14:36 - make sure you don't miss class
14:37 - but also my mom
14:39 - so my mom is mexican-american i'm mixed
14:42 - so my mom no matter what i was doing it
14:44 - didn't matter if i was working at a
14:45 - bookstore or like just going to a comic
14:47 - book store my mom was like we need more
14:49 - mexican-american women in the bookstore
14:51 - like you know we mean more
14:52 - mexican-american women representing us
14:54 - in tech and i was like yeah mom you're
14:55 - right you know and
14:57 - and even though i myself am you know
15:00 - very white passing i'm mixed you know my
15:02 - last name is johnson
15:03 - um
15:04 - that also like sticks with me like how
15:07 - can i be a representation of that how
15:09 - can i help people
15:10 - who um you know and bring them into the
15:13 - space that maybe like i
15:15 - was more comfortable in you know someone
15:18 - who you know
15:19 - doesn't feel more comfortable in that
15:20 - space how can i make them feel more
15:22 - comfortable because i'm very used to
15:23 - being the only woman in the room or
15:25 - being like you know the only person of
15:27 - mixed ethnicity or whatever it may be
15:30 - i'm very like comfortable with that
15:31 - because i've
15:32 - been you know i did martial arts as a
15:34 - kid i go to the gym like you know in the
15:36 - video game world ever all that's gotten
15:37 - better but
15:39 - trying to be very comfortable like no
15:40 - matter what you want to do like just go
15:42 - and do it don't look for other people
15:44 - just go and do it
15:47 - yeah i think your mom and i sound a lot
15:49 - of like my son is
15:50 - biracial as well black caribbean and
15:53 - colombian and so he definitely hears a
15:55 - lot of that from me as well of the
15:56 - importance of more than what he probably
15:58 - wants to hear about the importance of
16:00 - representation importance of
16:03 - feeling comfortable with sometimes being
16:04 - the only person of um whether it's
16:07 - gender race or ethnicity or all the
16:09 - other things that make us unique and fun
16:10 - so um i appreciate your mom
16:13 - yeah i didn't appreciate it as a kid i
16:14 - have to say like now that i'm older i
16:16 - really i really appreciate it i really
16:18 - understand what she was talking about
16:20 - and i really appreciate she like just
16:21 - never let me take like i don't know what
16:23 - if i'm the only girl as like an excuse
16:25 - she's like well too bad
16:28 - exactly exactly yeah those things that
16:30 - make us different make us really unique
16:31 - and give us a
16:32 - cool insight so um tell your mom thanks
16:37 - so much
16:38 - we do have a couple more questions but i
16:40 - just want to remind the audience that if
16:41 - you have any questions at all feel free
16:42 - to put it in the chat box we would love
16:44 - to hear um any questions that you might
16:46 - have for genevieve before in these last
16:48 - few minutes we have um so going back up
16:51 - you did show us that really amazing
16:52 - picture of the drawing that you drew my
16:55 - dragon would look nothing like that
16:57 - are there any other strengths that you
16:59 - have that you feel contributed to your
17:00 - success
17:02 - um i said the the ability to just be the
17:04 - only person in the room and never really
17:06 - worrying about that uh
17:08 - which i think any other beliefs i have
17:11 - so i
17:12 - really like to think about
17:14 - um the other person that i'm you know
17:17 - developing products for it so to be able
17:19 - to look outside of yourself and be like
17:21 - will this work for someone else will
17:22 - this experience like if the person comes
17:25 - in do they know where to go
17:26 - um if i'm making uh i do a lot of
17:29 - tutorials i do a lot of writing so
17:31 - trying to think about like how someone
17:32 - else is going to perceive my words so i
17:34 - think like you know take a lot of
17:35 - criticism and like but seeing it as that
17:38 - makes me stronger like looking actively
17:40 - seeking feedback so always taking my
17:42 - like whatever i'm doing getting feedback
17:44 - from it and taking that as a way to be
17:46 - better and not like oh no they didn't
17:48 - like it
17:50 - yeah that's a that's a crucial skill
17:53 - yeah you can get in that like so if
17:54 - you're if you're
17:56 - um if you're an artist or you're looking
17:58 - to start you know on roblox or something
18:00 - start making experience just start
18:01 - working and start sharing it with your
18:03 - friends share with your family get
18:04 - feedback and if they're like oh this is
18:05 - too hard don't tell them that they don't
18:07 - understand
18:09 - take a step back and figure out okay how
18:11 - can i make this more a more enjoyable
18:13 - experience
18:15 - perfect so we do have a couple of
18:17 - teacher questions that are about your
18:19 - book so can you give us a little bit
18:21 - more information about it in terms of
18:22 - when it will it be released where could
18:25 - folks find it if they're interested in
18:26 - purchasing it so you can actually get um
18:30 - there's two of them and then if i i
18:32 - think i closed out my picture
18:36 - so one is roblox development in 24 hours
18:38 - that one is currently available
18:40 - and the cover looks very very similar
18:42 - so let me
18:43 - yeah i did close it out
18:45 - uh but and then there's co that one is
18:47 - already out so that'll teach you things
18:49 - about like how do you make terrain work
18:51 - it does have a lot of coding within it
18:52 - because honestly once to really make
18:54 - things come alive you just need code
18:57 - but that the code in there is much more
18:59 - like here's the code that you add in but
19:01 - with coding in 24 hours during roblox
19:04 - lua
19:05 - that one which is coming out next month
19:07 - um and if people are really interested
19:10 - you can actually reach out to me at
19:11 - education roblox.com so that's our if
19:14 - you guys want to know you know anything
19:15 - more about like the creative commons
19:17 - materials that we have available or our
19:20 - education website yeah education
19:22 - roblox.com
19:23 - um education.roblox.com is the website
19:26 - but um the coding book will be out next
19:28 - month
19:29 - how exciting i'm so excited i'm so
19:32 - excited for this one like i love
19:34 - teaching code and like i feel like this
19:35 - is just the culmination of everything
19:37 - i've done so far so yeah
19:40 - yeah and especially in this topic let me
19:42 - tell you when i take my son to the
19:44 - library and i see the kids playing on
19:45 - the computer all of them are playing
19:47 - roblox like
19:48 - it's so popular so it's really exciting
19:51 - um another audience question is art do
19:53 - you all um you just gave your email if
19:55 - folks have questions do you all offer
19:56 - in-person coding classes that people can
19:59 - attend so we don't so we don't but like
20:02 - what we like to do is um we offer up
20:04 - this creative commons materials we offer
20:06 - good resources like the books that were
20:07 - created and then we have like hundreds
20:10 - literally hundreds of education you know
20:14 - organizations that we work with
20:16 - everything from curriculum um
20:17 - distributors and publishers to you know
20:20 - like mom and pops you know so you can
20:21 - take our creative common materials you
20:23 - can use them in your classroom as is or
20:25 - you can uh work with one of our many
20:27 - many like fantastic educators
20:30 - and they also you know that could
20:31 - provide uh
20:33 - i'll say resources and materials as well
20:34 - as well as instruction
20:36 - yeah but we ourselves don't actually
20:38 - offer classes directly
20:40 - okay we have a little onboarding for
20:41 - teachers though so if you come to our
20:43 - website like we've got courses for you
20:44 - that you can kind of be like oh this
20:46 - help roblox works this is how you make
20:47 - an account this is how you play a game
20:50 - yeah i imagine that'll be very useful to
20:52 - the parents and teachers watching
20:54 - yeah you know we try to be very
20:56 - considerate like you know this is how
20:58 - you you use the keyboard to move
21:00 - around so the next audience question
21:03 - actually ties in perfectly with the next
21:05 - question that i had for you which is
21:06 - about
21:07 - um being able to work at a company like
21:10 - roblox so
21:12 - if a student is watching this and
21:13 - they're like yes this is what i want to
21:15 - do i would love to be in game design and
21:17 - i would love to work for roblox what
21:19 - what does that look like what does what
21:21 - steps can they one start working on now
21:24 - and then part two of that question is
21:25 - what does the interview process look
21:27 - like for someone who who wants to do
21:28 - what you do so i would say if you want
21:31 - to work um you know making virtual
21:33 - experiences or roblox specifically
21:36 - uh start working on it now i would say
21:38 - so many of the employees at roblox
21:40 - started from the community we love
21:42 - hiring community members because they
21:44 - understand what our platform's about
21:46 - they have fantastic skills and they're
21:48 - motivated so um
21:50 - i would say whatever it is if you're an
21:52 - artist
21:53 - you know go and
21:55 - draw like everything around you draw
21:57 - animals draw the trees at the park draw
21:59 - up the buildings um and then take that
22:01 - in to roblox and recreate your local
22:04 - park or your school and recreate your
22:06 - drawings if you're interested in
22:08 - animation then you can try that out
22:11 - if you're interested in coding we have
22:12 - great resources like on our site
22:13 - education.roblox.com
22:15 - uh that free as well as like i said you
22:16 - can reach out to our coach but just like
22:18 - start my point is start try a little bit
22:19 - of everything
22:21 - um
22:22 - and you'll start developing a portfolio
22:23 - and then reach out to community members
22:26 - so you can get onto the forums we have
22:28 - developer forums for but we also like um
22:31 - an educator section of the developer
22:32 - forums
22:34 - you can reach out to like your peer
22:35 - groups if you're a student
22:37 - so you can you know your friends you're
22:40 - trying to create an experience together
22:41 - with your friends
22:43 - uh
22:44 - you know there's there's
22:45 - apps you know like discord or other you
22:47 - know roblox groups or that are
22:49 - interested in developing their own
22:51 - experiences so like if you love history
22:53 - i guarantee like it doesn't matter like
22:55 - what era of history it could be a very
22:56 - specific these two years of history you
22:58 - can find groups in roblox that also love
23:00 - history and want to make experiences
23:02 - that recreate that era or you know
23:05 - allow you to
23:07 - experience what it was like to live in
23:08 - that time or go to the moon no matter
23:11 - what it was or be as you know a
23:12 - zookeeper and so as you just keep
23:15 - working with people make friends show
23:16 - your work off get on twitter get on you
23:18 - know social media and be willing to both
23:21 - give positive feedback and i mean like
23:23 - critical feedback be like oh i think you
23:25 - could do this a little bit better but
23:26 - also take it ask people for feedback and
23:28 - that's how you develop these
23:29 - relationships that down the line
23:32 - are very valuable and then as you get
23:34 - older in college
23:35 - and in high school go to conferences
23:38 - so there's siggraph which is a
23:40 - conference that is for computer graphics
23:42 - and animation particular volunteering is
23:44 - a great way to go i would say more
23:46 - cheaply than you could otherwise and you
23:47 - also get like instant access to like
23:49 - everyone there who also really loves
23:52 - what you love uh pax is another good one
23:54 - and that's a giant gaming convention
23:57 - that happens on all coasts you can
23:59 - uh volunteer as well
24:02 - so yeah the moral story comes just start
24:04 - doing it and start looking for other
24:06 - people who want to do it with you
24:09 - can you um
24:11 - say again those two conferences that you
24:13 - just mentioned can you spell out just in
24:15 - case people need to write them down
24:17 - siggraph is one that's a little not as
24:19 - well known it's s-i-g-g-r-a-p-h
24:24 - special interest group in computer
24:26 - graphics
24:27 - that's what it stands for so it's part
24:29 - of amc association machine computing and
24:32 - then pax is p-a-x like xylophone
24:37 - packs um
24:39 - i don't know penny arcade expo that's
24:41 - what it stands for i was like what does
24:42 - that stand for so
24:43 - you know that's just like a big gaming
24:45 - conference you know people will dress up
24:48 - uh
24:48 - but
24:49 - even there is a pack stuff like you know
24:52 - like a developer section of that but i
24:53 - would say even just becoming part of
24:54 - these communities where you can find
24:56 - like-minded people
24:58 - um other like another huge one in the
25:00 - industry is gdc the game developers
25:02 - conference that's the largest game
25:04 - developers conference it's held in san
25:05 - francisco every year
25:06 - uh so if you can go go on like they'll
25:09 - have student days i highly recommend
25:11 - being a student volunteer whenever you
25:13 - can be um
25:15 - and just like i said yeah meet other
25:17 - people get involved
25:18 - with like your clubs at heist you know
25:20 - at the high school level you know make
25:21 - your own club
25:24 - i love that suggestion at volunteering
25:26 - at conferences i think that's a good but
25:29 - when you work in a field that's a good
25:30 - way to networking and being able to go
25:33 - to conferences either for free or for
25:34 - less amount we're able to volunteer so
25:37 - yeah a little nugget to take
25:39 - those those people who are students when
25:41 - i was a student are now like some of my
25:43 - strongest you know i would say ties in
25:45 - the industry
25:46 - like
25:47 - always be nice to everyone you never
25:49 - know who they're going to be in a few
25:50 - years and a lot of times you know like
25:52 - you're like oh yeah wait i know so and
25:54 - so i met them few years ago to go at a
25:55 - conference
25:56 - um
25:57 - and like those those ties are you know
25:59 - really important
26:02 - yeah so you've talked you showed us the
26:05 - cool work that you're doing and i know
26:06 - you've probably seen a lot of
26:08 - games and experience in a roblox is
26:10 - there any game that you've seen that
26:12 - someone create that either was um
26:15 - surprised you or you thought that was
26:16 - really cool and innovative
26:19 - oh my gosh i mean all the time and i'm
26:22 - like i'm like overwhelmed because i'm
26:23 - just like
26:24 - where do i even even start um
26:29 - let's see the
26:31 - on roblox all right hold on
26:33 - i feel like i need a visual but it would
26:35 - take me too long to bring up so i think
26:38 - what's really cool about roblox
26:40 - experiences is that they can be
26:43 - these
26:45 - hangout spaces that aren't necessarily
26:47 - rooted in the real world
26:49 - so if you we just did like these
26:51 - concerts like one of the ones that we
26:52 - did we did like a 21 pilots concert um
26:55 - but what i love music and i love going
26:58 - to concerts but what i kind of live like
27:00 - there was like this music going on i can
27:02 - dress up my character i had a scooter
27:05 - but also like the way that we were
27:06 - experiencing the music was not a way we
27:09 - could do in real life so it was like we
27:11 - would get transported around
27:13 - um we would like playing with the space
27:15 - that we were in so we would be you would
27:17 - be in one space and then you would fall
27:19 - through the floor and then you'd be in
27:20 - this like disco room and then you would
27:23 - be dancing and you'd step on a square
27:24 - and then like suddenly you're like uh in
27:27 - a virtual forest and then like all of a
27:29 - sudden like the the singers and the
27:31 - drummers you know like they'll be giant
27:33 - like your tiny little people dancing at
27:34 - their feet so i think like being able to
27:37 - take something like for me it's just
27:38 - really familiar going to a concert
27:40 - and then like twisting it so not just
27:42 - are we trying to do like recreate real
27:44 - life we're trying we're taking advantage
27:46 - of what virtual reality you know like
27:49 - not even like a headset but like what
27:51 - that virtual space can do to like help
27:54 - you connect to the music a lot more than
27:56 - like maybe you even could if you're
27:58 - up in the nosebleeds of some giant
28:00 - concert like you know 21 pilots i i
28:02 - would probably be like that far away and
28:04 - you'd be like
28:05 - where are they at like
28:09 - yeah
28:09 - oh man i wish we had more time but
28:12 - somehow we got through 30 minutes that
28:13 - quickly so
28:15 - i wanted to say thank you for joining us
28:17 - today yeah it was really great to hear
28:19 - about your experiences um working at
28:20 - roblox and working in game design so
28:23 - thank you for your time today
28:25 - teachers please fill out the survey that
28:27 - you will receive via email tomorrow and
28:29 - be sure to check out the other class
28:31 - chats and virtual field trips at
28:32 - code.org
28:34 - cs journeys they're happening all
28:35 - semester long thanks genevieve and
28:37 - thanks everyone
