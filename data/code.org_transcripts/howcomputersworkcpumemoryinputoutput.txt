00:10 - Hi, my name is Madison Maxey.
00:13 - I have a company called Loomia,
00:15 - and we focus on making smart fabrics for smart clothing and smart soft good products.
00:21 - The sky's the limit when it comes to textiles.
00:25 - My name is Danielle Applestone, and I'm CEO of Othermachine Company.
00:31 - We build a desktop milling machine.
00:34 - A milling machine takes a rotating cutting tool and moves it through material to create a 3D object.
00:42 - Under the hood, all computers do the same four basic things.
00:46 - They input information,
00:48 - store and process the information,
00:50 - and then, output information.
00:53 - Each of these things is done by a different part of the computer.
00:57 - There are input devices that take input from the outside world and convert it into binary information.
01:04 - There is memory to store this information.
01:08 - There's a central processing unit or CPU,
01:12 - where all the calculations are done.
01:14 - And, finally, there are output devices that take information and convert it into a physical output.
01:22 - Let's talk about input first.
01:24 - Computers can take many different types of input, like the keyboard of a computer, the touchpad of a phone,
01:30 - a camera, a microphone, or a GPS.
01:33 - But even the sensors on a car, a thermostat, or a drone are also different input devices.
01:40 - Now, let's look at a simple example of how input travels through a computer and becomes output.
01:47 - When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number.
01:54 - That number is sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer.
02:00 - Starting from this number, the CPU calculates how to display the letter "B" pixel by pixel.
02:06 - The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory, which tell it how to draw the letter "B".
02:12 - The CPU runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in memory.
02:18 - Finally, this pixel information is sent in binary to the screen.
02:22 - The screen is an output device, which converts the binary signals into the tiny lights and colors that make up what you see.
02:32 - This all happens so quickly it feels instantaneous,
02:36 - but to display each letter a computer runs thousands of instructions,
02:42 - starting from the moment your finger presses the key point.
02:48 - In that example, the output device was the screen, but there are many different types of output
02:53 - which take a binary signal from the computer and do something in the physical world.
02:57 - For example, a speaker will play sound, and a 3D printer will print an object.
03:03 - Output devices can also control physical motion like a robotic arm, the motor of a car,
03:09 - or the cutting tool of the milling machine that my company makes.
03:13 - New types of inputs and outputs let computers interact with the world in entirely new ways.
03:19 - This has been helped out by improvements to the speed and size of the memory and CPU.
03:24 - The more complicated a task is and the more information that is input or output,
03:29 - the more processing power and memory a computer needs.
03:33 - Typing letters on a screen may be easy but to do complicated 3d graphics or record a high-definition movie,
03:41 - modern computers often have multiple CPUs to process all that information
03:46 - and many gigabytes of memory to store it.
03:51 - No matter what it is you want to do with the computer, every single action is about:
03:57 - inputting information from the physical world,
04:01 - storing and processing that information,
04:04 - and getting some output back into the physical world.
