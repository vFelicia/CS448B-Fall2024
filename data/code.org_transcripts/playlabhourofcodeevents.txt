00:00 - Now, we're going to learn about something
that all game programmers use everyday. They're
00:05 - called events. An event tells your program
to listen for when something happens. When
00:12 - that thing happens, it performs an action.
Some examples of events are listening for
00:17 - a mouse click, an arrow button, or a tap on
the screen. Here, we're going to make the
00:22 - space bot greet the earthlings when a player
clicks on him. We'll use the "when clicked"
00:27 - block and attach the "say" block to it. When
the player clicks on the space bot, everything
00:32 - attached to this "when clicked" event block
will be performed. What does your alien say?
00:37 - There are also "when arrow" blocks. If you
link the "move" blocks to these, you can start
00:41 - to move your actors up, down, left, or right.
Step by step, your game is getting more interactive.
00:49 - For me, part of the reason I wanted to start a game company was because I wanted to make games
00:54 - I wanted to create something that people could love, play and enjoy
00:57 - My advice for kids who want to do things and learn computer science, just start doing stuff.
01:03 - Start playing around. And maybe if you're a little insecure or a little afraid, that's okay.
01:07 - Find a friend who maybe has a little more experience. Look at video tutorials.
01:12 - Just jump in there and try to create something. Even if you might be like, "Is this a little cheesy?"
01:19 - Or even if you want to look at it and say "Well I could just go play that somewhere else."
01:23 - The act of trying to create something in your own vision is an amazingly fun experience
01:28 - and I just encourage people just to DO stuff. That's really the most important part.
