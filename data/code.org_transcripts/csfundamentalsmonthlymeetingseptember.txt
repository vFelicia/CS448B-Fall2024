00:03 - and i'm gonna formally welcome you to
00:06 - the very first computer science
00:07 - fundamentals monthly meeting of the year
00:10 - we're hoping to host these meetings um
00:13 - over the next several months for all k5
00:15 - teachers across the world who are
00:16 - interested in implementing our cs
00:18 - fundamentals curriculum
00:19 - my name is melissa jones i'm a community
00:21 - manager here at code.org this evening
00:23 - you're also going to hear from kiki
00:24 - prattsman is a program manager a special
00:27 - guest joel spencer who's a k5 affiliate
00:29 - and maybe for lucky laura klein as well
00:30 - who's the program manager our goals for
00:32 - these calls number one first and
00:34 - foremost is to help connect you as a
00:35 - community we have hundreds of thousands
00:38 - of teachers across the world um teaching
00:40 - this curriculum and k5 well i guess
00:42 - hundreds of thousands of students
00:44 - and thousands of teachers teaching this
00:46 - curriculum across the world and we want
00:48 - to be able to start sharing best
00:49 - practices and ideas across that
00:51 - community
00:52 - we want to understand you know how you
00:54 - guys are kicking off your year here in
00:56 - september with back to school we also
00:58 - want to give you a chance to get to know
00:59 - the basics of our curriculum and how to
01:01 - implement it and then give you time to
01:03 - share questions concerns and feedback
01:04 - with the group
01:07 - so just to get started i wanted to go
01:09 - over a couple program updates um one
01:11 - thing that you may have noticed recently
01:13 - the co-studio courses one two and three
01:15 - plus our fourth course which is um
01:17 - currently in beta you know we've
01:18 - referred to those in the past as
01:19 - co-studio courses 123 or the k5
01:22 - curriculum
01:23 - but we are now starting to use the name
01:25 - computer science fundamentals for these
01:27 - courses it's the same courses same great
01:29 - content just a new name and kiki's going
01:31 - to talk a little bit more about that
01:32 - later on in terms of which course is
01:34 - right for you
01:37 - also just a quick congratulations
01:39 - this year over the past several months
01:41 - we've trained 15 000 teachers on cs
01:44 - fundamentals and some of our other
01:46 - curricula here that we offer at code.org
01:48 - so those of you who are joining the call
01:50 - you may be a trainer you may be a
01:51 - teacher but congratulations on all the
01:54 - work that you've done to make computer
01:55 - science education a priority in your
01:57 - classroom and in your district
01:59 - and just some quick stats here um this
02:02 - is
02:03 - kind of a map showing you where our k5cs
02:05 - fundamentals trainings have been taking
02:07 - place and how have been taking place
02:08 - rather and how many teachers that we've
02:10 - reached
02:11 - and we hope that you will take take the
02:13 - time to find a workshop near you if you
02:14 - haven't been to one already
02:16 - so first and foremost i'd like to hand
02:18 - it over to joel spencer who's our guest
02:20 - speaker this evening joel take it away
02:24 - hello hello how are y'all doing tonight
02:28 - all right so my name is joel spencer i
02:30 - am the k5 affiliate in little rock
02:33 - arkansas i came on year one uh we just
02:36 - started our year two um uh we've had
02:39 - some very successful trainings here in
02:41 - arkansas we've done about um third a
02:43 - little over 30 workshops across uh
02:45 - arkansas missouri parts of oklahoma
02:49 - and uh
02:50 - memphis
02:51 - um
02:52 - i think about 800 teachers trained in
02:54 - those workshops over the years so um
02:56 - i've seen every single question you
02:58 - could possibly ask so you know later on
03:00 - if you have any questions for me i'd be
03:01 - glad to answer them uh for today what
03:03 - i'm just basically gonna do is just give
03:05 - you um some top tips for getting started
03:08 - uh some of you may be rookies at this uh
03:10 - some of you may be uh experienced more
03:13 - experienced than me at this
03:14 - for my background teaching this i
03:16 - started teaching this about two years
03:18 - ago
03:19 - like a six-week module for one of our
03:21 - clubs and um that's how i got hooked
03:25 - into it that's how i got my students
03:27 - hooked into it i'm a stem lab teacher at
03:29 - a school of little rock arkansas in
03:30 - grades two through five about i see
03:33 - about 570 kids a week and this is my
03:35 - first year taking every second through
03:37 - fifth grader through the code studio
03:39 - course last year was kind of three five
03:41 - so i'm adding second grade on on to this
03:43 - year so i just have kind of like my
03:45 - david letterman's top 10 list for
03:47 - getting started in in computer science
03:49 - fundamentals which is which is now what
03:51 - they call the code studio courses um so
03:54 - number one um start slow um kind of like
03:57 - what i did you may want to start with
03:58 - just one class or two classes um to kind
04:01 - of get your feet wet uh maybe start with
04:03 - the fifth graders now maybe after
04:05 - christmas break you know bring in your
04:07 - fourth grade or third graders or if you
04:08 - just teach one class um just start slow
04:11 - with them
04:12 - pace yourself don't think you know oh my
04:14 - gosh i gotta get through all of course
04:15 - two or course three in an entire year
04:18 - you know last year my kids did course
04:20 - two we didn't finish it and i'm okay
04:22 - with that i mean because i know i
04:23 - exposed them to more computer science in
04:25 - just that year than they may have ever
04:26 - gotten exposed to so first rule start
04:29 - slow pace yourself number two find a
04:32 - buddy teacher find someone else in your
04:34 - district or in your school that is
04:36 - willing to kind of hold your hand
04:38 - through this with you someone who can
04:39 - help you out
04:40 - someone you can bounce ideas off of us
04:43 - someone who may also want to teach this
04:44 - to in your school and you guys can see
04:46 - what's working what's not schedule wise
04:48 - um
04:49 - it's always great to have someone else
04:51 - to help you and have another hands-on
04:52 - you know so you don't fill out so you
04:53 - don't feel like you're out there on a
04:55 - lion
04:56 - on an island sorry also um get connected
04:58 - with the code.org blogs and discussion
05:00 - forum i'm sure kiki's going to share
05:02 - those with you and or melissa and or
05:04 - laura we'll share those with you towards
05:06 - the end of our um our session tonight
05:08 - they're really good people have the same
05:10 - questions same you know
05:12 - uh
05:13 - same things that you're going through
05:15 - are on that forum and it's a great way
05:16 - to get some answers from either one of
05:19 - the you know over 100 some affiliates we
05:21 - have at code.org or from when someone
05:23 - actually who works for code.org
05:24 - personally up there in seattle so get on
05:26 - those discussion forums you know um look
05:29 - at their blogs look at their twitter
05:30 - page find out what's going on exactly um
05:32 - also if you haven't done it yet attend a
05:34 - local workshop i'm not sure if the few
05:36 - people we have on here attended a local
05:37 - workshop but that's the best way to get
05:40 - started because that kind of gives you
05:41 - the whole background you know you kind
05:43 - of can see the scope and sequence of the
05:45 - courses um and you can see how it kind
05:48 - of flows and you can kind of get your
05:49 - feet with with the unplugged activities
05:51 - which are awesome in the online
05:52 - activities which are awesome also
05:55 - um start small i mean when i got my kids
05:58 - hooked in this we started with the hour
05:59 - of code two years ago and that was their
06:01 - hook you know that was what got them
06:03 - interested that is what got me
06:05 - interested and that's a relatively you
06:07 - know painless operation for you to start
06:09 - with is start with the hour code you
06:11 - know go to the website do some of the
06:13 - old tutorials until the new ones come
06:14 - out in december um that's a great thing
06:17 - uh that you can do um a lot of times
06:20 - when we get new students into my
06:21 - classroom and never done the code
06:22 - courses before i'll say you know what
06:24 - i'm gonna put you on a group of three or
06:25 - four and i want you to go through one of
06:26 - these our code class you know whether it
06:29 - be you know the angry birds or the on an
06:31 - elsa or one of the ones from tinker um
06:33 - we use those as a great starting point
06:35 - in my
06:36 - in my stem lab um number six is very
06:39 - important because this is one that that
06:41 - was hard for me is that it would be
06:43 - don't be a know-it-all don't think that
06:45 - you have to read every single lesson you
06:47 - know top to bottom you know plants six
06:50 - weeks ahead i like and i still do this i
06:53 - learn with the kids because i notice if
06:55 - i have a tendency to go online and work
06:57 - all the puzzles
06:59 - then i'm gonna want to give them the
07:00 - answers or lead them in the right
07:02 - direction but if we're doing it together
07:04 - if we're trying to figure it out
07:05 - together it's a learning experience for
07:07 - both of us so don't be surprised also if
07:09 - during this process your kids know more
07:11 - about this than you do because they will
07:14 - the best phrase i heard from my last
07:15 - workshop is that people now
07:18 - you know i use technology our kids live
07:20 - through technology and that's one of the
07:21 - greatest things you know i've heard you
07:23 - know we just use it on an occasional
07:24 - basis and some of us live through it but
07:26 - our kids are growing up now living
07:27 - through technology and there's some
07:29 - things that i'm surprised you know my my
07:31 - own first graders my own first great son
07:33 - can do that i would never been able to
07:34 - do with technology when i was in first
07:36 - grade um so uh yeah don't be a
07:38 - know-it-all don't think i have to learn
07:39 - i have to know more than them in this
07:41 - learn together make mistakes together
07:43 - and you'll both grow together um
07:46 - also
07:47 - make sure you teach the unplugged
07:48 - activities i have some teachers who say
07:50 - uh i don't have time to just do online
07:51 - activities i i actually made that
07:53 - mistake when i first started out with my
07:55 - club i thought i'm not gonna do the
07:56 - unplugged activities we're just gonna do
07:58 - the online activities for time's sake
07:59 - and i realized my kids that club didn't
08:02 - get the foundations that they needed
08:04 - they you know they understood how to do
08:05 - the puzzles but they didn't grasp the
08:08 - foundation of what an algorithm is or
08:09 - what looping is or what conditionals are
08:12 - and that's what those unplugged
08:13 - activities they build those foundations
08:15 - they build those foundations for um
08:18 - what they're gonna be learning in their
08:19 - next steps um so make sure you're doing
08:21 - the unplugged activities uh also uh be
08:24 - scared this is scary and that's okay i
08:26 - mean there's some days when i'm getting
08:27 - ready to teach a lesson like oh my gosh
08:29 - we're doing conditionals today it's
08:30 - gonna be nerve-wracking and they're not
08:31 - gonna get it it's okay i always teach a
08:34 - little fear because i i think that that
08:36 - makes me a better teacher so um so
08:38 - whenever we're doing these code.org
08:39 - lessons wherever we're doing this you
08:41 - know scientific method or this week when
08:43 - the kids are having to build towers out
08:45 - of you know uh pipe cleaners paper clips
08:48 - and straws to hold a golf ball i mean
08:49 - all that's scary and it's fun because it
08:51 - makes it more interesting and doesn't
08:53 - make the day boring
08:54 - um also let your students problem solve
08:56 - and learn from each other when the kids
08:58 - are doing this in my class i am the last
09:00 - person they come to
09:02 - um they have to you know at their tables
09:04 - check with people at their tables um
09:06 - check with people surrounding them so
09:08 - they have to go through like six or
09:09 - seven people before they even come see
09:10 - me because students learn best from each
09:13 - other and um
09:15 - i don't like i said i don't want to be a
09:16 - nodal i want them to learn i want them
09:18 - to facilitate i want them to have those
09:19 - conversations that communication that
09:21 - problem solving that perseverance among
09:24 - themselves um and last one and have fun
09:27 - with it i mean the one thing i love
09:28 - about these code.org lessons is that
09:30 - they're fun the kids love them i mean
09:33 - it's not like what you think computer
09:34 - programming would be where they're
09:36 - sitting around all day typing html or
09:37 - javascript these lessons are fun they're
09:39 - engaging it makes them think it slows
09:42 - down their thinking which a lot of our
09:44 - kids need this day i need these days and
09:47 - also don't think there's one correct way
09:49 - to teach it i have many people in my
09:51 - workshop say what's what's the best way
09:53 - to teach it and i say there is no magic
09:56 - bullet for one way to teach us it's
09:57 - whatever works for your setting you know
10:00 - you may only be able to teach this 45
10:01 - minutes a week you may have to teach us
10:02 - an hour and a half a week you may only
10:04 - be able to teach us 30 minutes a week so
10:06 - don't get bogged down to the set that oh
10:08 - i have to teach it this way i have to
10:10 - make sure i get through lesson one two
10:12 - three or stage one two three and four by
10:13 - this date
10:14 - you know just teach it when teach it you
10:16 - know however best adapt your classroom
10:18 - because if you think your kids aren't
10:20 - getting enough of it just think at least
10:22 - you're getting something because if you
10:23 - wouldn't be teaching it they wouldn't be
10:24 - getting anything
10:26 - um that's all i have to say for now i'll
10:28 - turn it back to the gang at code.org and
10:30 - i'll let them take it away and i'll hang
10:31 - around and answer any questions that you
10:33 - have
10:35 - thanks joel
10:36 - that was great
10:37 - um
10:39 - i love those tips and i would definitely
10:42 - like to copy that top 10 list
10:44 - you have my permission
10:47 - only it's gonna cost you five hundred
10:49 - dollars no i'm just kidding
10:51 - we're a non-profit i know you can pay me
10:55 - you can pay me in spice drops
10:56 - there you go
10:59 - we'll add it to your account yes hey so
11:02 - i'm kiki protzman i am a education
11:06 - program manager here at code.org and my
11:10 - baby project is cs fundamentals so i've
11:13 - been working on it since the very
11:15 - beginning and
11:16 - i'm very happy to watch it grow and know
11:19 - the plans for its growth in the future
11:21 - ah no let's go for it
11:24 - uh so this is
11:27 - well the slides look like they're having
11:29 - a moment delay there okay
11:32 - so i just want to talk to you kind of
11:33 - about getting started with coding in
11:35 - your classes and we had heard some great
11:37 - tips for getting started but now let's
11:39 - talk about choosing what you use
11:43 - let's start of course with the code.org
11:45 - curriculum although it's certainly not
11:47 - the only thing out there and we don't
11:50 - even try to say that it's the only thing
11:52 - you should use we we definitely
11:54 - recommend using a variety
11:56 - but here is what we have to offer right
11:58 - now for the kind of k-5 level and beyond
12:03 - people teachers look at this and they
12:05 - don't know where they should start they
12:07 - don't know if you start at the very
12:08 - beginning and work your way through or
12:10 - if you choose a course level based on
12:13 - the grade you teach
12:14 - but it's actually just a little bit more
12:17 - complicated than that
12:19 - so really anyone
12:21 - can start at any course in fact even
12:24 - having adults start with course one
12:26 - helps them feel more comfortable as they
12:28 - move through
12:29 - so as a teacher if you've never done it
12:32 - before i recommend starting with course
12:34 - one to see what's up and kind of moving
12:36 - through so that you feel
12:38 - like you have all the necessary
12:40 - prerequisites
12:41 - but for your actual classroom
12:43 - we recommend that you
12:45 - choose based on the level that your
12:47 - students are so if your students are
12:50 - pre-readers and they're not very nimble
12:53 - with the computer yet and it takes a
12:56 - little bit to get them focused and
12:58 - staying on task we recommend you start
13:00 - with course one
13:01 - the interface for that is very friendly
13:05 - and it's much easier
13:07 - to navigate for little hands there's a
13:10 - lot less reading to do
13:12 - if your students can read then we
13:15 - recommend starting with course two
13:18 - course two
13:19 - covers almost everything that course one
13:22 - covers
13:24 - it just does it in a little bit faster
13:26 - pace
13:27 - and it uses more words so students can
13:30 - get practice reading and it jumps into
13:33 - math and beyond
13:35 - and then after course two you would go
13:37 - on to course three now course three does
13:39 - require course two so it assumes you've
13:43 - had course two before you move on to
13:45 - course three and then course four which
13:47 - will come out of beta fairly soon
13:50 - believes that you have had both course
13:52 - two and course three
13:54 - there's also the accelerated course if
13:56 - you're doing this after school or you're
13:58 - trying to really just get the entire
14:00 - idea of computer science in a very short
14:02 - period of time the accelerated course
14:05 - moves a little faster it's a little more
14:06 - complex and it covers everything in
14:09 - about 20 lessons now it was built for
14:12 - kindergarten through eighth grade and so
14:15 - obviously it doesn't target any of them
14:17 - perfectly but you can modify it to fit
14:20 - your your own age range
14:24 - all right
14:26 - okay
14:27 - so then what happens if you're ready for
14:29 - something more what happens if your
14:31 - students have done some of the code.org
14:33 - stuff and you feel like they're really
14:35 - maturing out of that tutorial cycle
14:38 - where they don't need individual lessons
14:40 - along the way anymore
14:42 - two of the things that we really really
14:44 - enjoy
14:45 - are scratch and the foods
14:49 - now
14:50 - cs first from google has some great
14:52 - curriculum for scratch
14:54 - it is very easy to follow if you're a
14:57 - teacher it's very animated it has videos
15:00 - and a lot of fun projects and at the
15:02 - heart of it
15:03 - it's still scratch
15:05 - the fuse might be something you don't
15:07 - know quite as well it's relatively new
15:11 - and they have something super amazing
15:14 - coming out and i'm going to try and demo
15:15 - it for you
15:17 - but in case it doesn't work there's a
15:18 - little video linked down here are they
15:20 - going to have access to the slides yes
15:22 - they should afterwards so we'll put
15:24 - we'll put the slides up so that you can
15:26 - watch the video about this alpha that
15:29 - i'm going to be showing you right now
15:32 - so this is the fooze and i went to the
15:35 - foose.com
15:36 - alpha
15:37 - and that's taking me to this little
15:40 - project that they're just starting to
15:42 - work on
15:43 - and this is a level builder so you can
15:45 - go in and you can create your own games
15:48 - using drag and drop programming
15:50 - so
15:52 - if you click here you'll get a new level
15:55 - and
15:56 - all of the typing all of the words in
15:59 - this
16:01 - are auto-generated
16:03 - so students aren't going to be creating
16:05 - inappropriate titles you just click
16:08 - through until you get something that
16:11 - inspires you and i like this ninja above
16:13 - heart let's go with that one
16:16 - so now we can kind of scroll through
16:20 - and we can click edit to build
16:25 - now
16:26 - i'm going to
16:28 - drag something up here
16:31 - and i'm just kind of creating a little
16:33 - environment here
16:35 - so let's put a box there
16:38 - and it says ninja above heart so i feel
16:40 - like i should
16:41 - make a heart
16:48 - i don't know if this level will be
16:50 - playable but we'll see
16:51 - okay
16:53 - so once you have all these things out
16:54 - here
16:56 - i feel like maybe i should drag this guy
16:58 - above the heart
17:00 - uh now you can
17:03 - add programming to the levels so you can
17:05 - come in
17:08 - and you can make it so that
17:10 - when you bump into the block something
17:12 - happens and so i'm just going to say
17:15 - something drops out
17:16 - when i bump into the block so you can
17:19 - program every block
17:21 - every item
17:22 - in this game using the simple drag and
17:24 - drop
17:25 - and then when you're done you click run
17:30 - and now you can actually play your level
17:33 - so i'm going to come through
17:35 - push that out of the way
17:38 - try to
17:39 - it's hard on the internet here it's not
17:41 - letting me go
17:42 - try to
17:44 - pop up and grab that
17:47 - and then i have to figure out oh yeah
17:49 - how to get up onto the heart
17:54 - and get that star
17:56 - and woohoo i did it so i'm gonna do a
17:58 - little happy dance
18:00 - okay
18:02 - so that is
18:05 - i'm gonna stop sharing
18:07 - and we can go back to the slides now
18:11 - but
18:12 - that is just another one of the
18:14 - fun programming environments that's out
18:16 - there
18:17 - so you don't have to feel limited to the
18:19 - things that you already know if you're
18:21 - willing to do as joel said and learn
18:24 - along with your students and not be
18:26 - scared there are a lot of amazing
18:28 - opportunities out there to just blow the
18:29 - students away and make them feel like
18:31 - this is the most fun and engaging
18:34 - subject that they have ever encountered
18:38 - and then i've gotten this question a
18:41 - bunch what do you do if your students
18:42 - move at a different pace
18:44 - and there are a couple of options we
18:46 - give right now and the first is
18:48 - have them do play lab projects so if
18:50 - they've finished a little bit early have
18:52 - them go into a play lab project and just
18:54 - keep building it out
18:56 - and then the other thing is to have them
18:57 - pick a new tool to try on their own so
19:00 - at code.org
19:02 - learn
19:03 - there are all these great tools that
19:05 - have been curated by code.org that teach
19:08 - coding and if students know that when
19:11 - they're done they can go into any of
19:13 - these and teach themselves how to use
19:15 - the tool
19:16 - their education will be in their own
19:17 - hands that it will feel much much more
19:19 - powerful
19:23 - and that does it for me great
19:25 - um we also have a number of professional
19:27 - development options for you this year
19:29 - first and foremost are the in-person
19:31 - workshops laura already put a link to
19:33 - those in the chat pod so if you haven't
19:36 - been to an in-person face-to-face
19:38 - workshop please do try to find one near
19:40 - you and sign up i know our affiliates
19:42 - like joel would be happy to see you
19:44 - there
19:46 - next we have an online professional
19:48 - development that we've launched this
19:49 - year so it covers a lot of the same
19:51 - topics as the in-person pd um but of
19:53 - course you don't get a chance to
19:55 - interact with peers or with facilitators
19:56 - when you do it online so if you don't
19:59 - have a facilitator near you please do um
20:02 - take a look at that online pd and work
20:03 - your way through it if you have already
20:05 - done the in-person pd we think it's a
20:06 - great follow-up
20:08 - um and then just the last thing to talk
20:10 - about is the hour of code is coming
20:12 - um so in uh december like 17th through
20:15 - the 7th through the 13th floor is that
20:17 - right that is correct 7 through the 13th
20:19 - the hour of code is coming do you want
20:20 - to talk about how k5 teachers can get
20:22 - involved for yeah so right now if you go
20:25 - to the hour of code.com you can sign up
20:28 - your classroom to host an hour of code
20:30 - this december 7th through the 13th
20:32 - so even if you haven't done any computer
20:34 - science with your class um and you don't
20:37 - think you'll get to it until december
20:39 - you can start with the hour of code
20:42 - right now if you sign up you can get
20:44 - really great posters featuring
20:46 - inspirational uh thought leaders like
20:49 - cheryl sandberg and president obama to

20:54 - offering
20:55 - a ten thousand dollars
20:57 - in hardware to one school in every state
21:00 - that participates in the hour of code um
21:03 - so be look sign up now uh so you can get
21:06 - updates with those prizes um we'll be
21:08 - releasing many more um and you can start
21:11 - to plan that with your class

21:20 - the correct information on it

21:36 - success
21:38 - um so joel mentioned that we have a
21:41 - twitter account now for
21:43 - teachersforcode.org and it's teach code
21:45 - so if you want to follow teach code on
21:46 - twitter
