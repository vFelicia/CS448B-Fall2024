00:09 - [Music]
00:22 - so
02:47 - hi everybody welcome to code break my
02:49 - name is hadi and there's a whole bunch
02:51 - of people joining us on a zoom call as
02:53 - well as on facebook live and on youtube
02:55 - live
02:56 - together we're hoping to build the
02:57 - world's largest live interactive
02:59 - classroom with so many students at home
03:01 - due to the pandemic my team at code.org
03:03 - invites families everywhere to join us
03:05 - for a weekly dose of inspiration
03:07 - community and computer science
03:09 - i'm here with my daughter and sidekick
03:11 - sophia she's a oh hi
03:14 - yeah she's a she's a budding computer
03:16 - scientist and i'd like to introduce our
03:18 - first special guest sal khan
03:20 - if you're like the many tens of millions
03:22 - of students who've ever learned
03:23 - something interesting on khan academy
03:25 - sal is the founder and ceo he's a good
03:27 - friend and he's one of my personal
03:29 - inspirations for why i started code.org
03:32 - sal how are you
03:33 - good how are y'all doing hey sophia hey
03:35 - heidi
03:36 - hi there and where are you calling us
03:38 - from
03:38 - i am calling from the walk-in closet in
03:42 - our master bedroom this is actually
03:44 - where khan academy started so in some uh
03:47 - strange way a covet has got us back to
03:49 - our roots
03:51 - in mountain view california
03:53 - and that's great and what's been the
03:55 - impact on khan academy with school
03:56 - closing and so many students being at
03:58 - home well uh you can imagine you know
04:01 - when we started seeing the schools uh
04:03 - well we we initially saw a traffic peak
04:06 - in in in places like uh taiwan and south
04:08 - korea because that's where they saw the
04:10 - first wave of of obviously kovid and
04:12 - some of the closures and then uh we saw
04:15 - when that first week that the u.s closed
04:17 - and then really much of the world our
04:19 - traffic since then has been about 3x of
04:21 - what it typically has been and so we've
04:23 - just been trying to you know make sure
04:24 - that everything is up and running and
04:26 - then trying to figure out how to support
04:27 - folks in in more ways and i know you all
04:29 - are doing that as well and i guess this
04:30 - is part of it
04:32 - yeah
04:33 - yeah it's been difficult for all of us
04:35 - uh this week is a very special week it's
04:38 - teacher appreciation week uh do you have
04:40 - any thoughts you'd like to share with
04:41 - the teachers or the parents who are on
04:43 - the call or students
04:45 - yeah you know i think well i think
04:46 - there's a couple of layers there this
04:48 - would have been teachers appreciate
04:49 - teacher appreciation regardless of
04:51 - what's going on in the broader world but
04:52 - i think especially with uh so many
04:54 - students at home and a lot of it you
04:57 - know leaning more on us parents and on
05:00 - on the students i think that gives us
05:01 - even a deeper appreciation uh for what
05:04 - teachers do day in day out and i i think
05:06 - i can speak for a lot of you students i
05:08 - see a lot of great young faces out there
05:10 - that a lot of times you know you go to
05:11 - school day and day out and you can kind
05:12 - of take it for granted you can say oh i
05:14 - gotta go to school i gotta sit through
05:16 - this class but now that you don't have
05:18 - it i'm hearing from a lot of young
05:19 - people that they really miss it and they
05:21 - really miss those teachers and they
05:22 - really miss those engagements i think
05:23 - we're all appreciating teachers that
05:25 - much more and i know a lot of teachers
05:27 - are doing heroic efforts to continue to
05:29 - support uh all of us uh as we go through
05:32 - this covid crisis i know my kids you
05:34 - know the teachers are really making
05:36 - themselves available and are kind of
05:38 - doing whatever they can to get us
05:40 - through this so yes teacher appreciation
05:42 - a week takes on special special meaning
05:44 - uh right now you know personally and
05:46 - especially if i were to you know there's
05:48 - a lot of teachers that have had very
05:49 - meaningful impact in my life but you
05:52 - know two especially when i think about
05:54 - on the coding side of things since this
05:56 - is a code.org event uh i remember uh dr
06:00 - uh sorry mr hernandez was my algebra 2
06:03 - teacher but he's the first one i
06:04 - actually i didn't have a computer but i
06:06 - was fascinated by it and and he actually
06:08 - introduced me to programming my
06:09 - calculator uh which you know i still
06:12 - they have these ti and that's actually
06:13 - where i discovered a love for
06:14 - programming and then at the local
06:17 - university uh dr santania i was taking
06:19 - classes at university of new orleans i
06:21 - must have been about 15 years old and
06:23 - he
06:24 - saw that i really cared about like i was
06:26 - really intrigued by computing and he
06:28 - kind of made up an internship for me so
06:30 - that i could program on the computers at
06:32 - the university uh and if he hadn't done
06:34 - that for me uh you know who knows the
06:37 - world would have been might have been
06:38 - very different khan academy wouldn't
06:39 - have existed if i didn't have the coding
06:41 - skills to at least build it in those
06:42 - early stages and i wouldn't have had
06:44 - those coding skills or the confidence to
06:45 - do it if dr santania didn't let me use
06:48 - his computers because i my family
06:50 - couldn't afford one so a lot of teachers
06:52 - played a big role in my life and and
06:54 - especially on that computing side of
06:55 - things
06:56 - that's beautiful and pretty much any but
06:58 - if you ask them why did they like what
06:59 - was their favorite subject and why the
07:02 - reason is usually because of that
07:03 - teacher
07:04 - so
07:05 - we're going to talk about teacher
07:06 - appreciation week throughout the episode
07:08 - but let's start with the computer joke
07:10 - of the day with sophia
07:12 - okay um what do you call it when a
07:14 - computer science students make fun of
07:17 - each other
07:18 - a computer
07:20 - computer science students
07:22 - make fun of each other
07:26 - i don't know what do you call it
07:28 - the answer is cyber boolean
07:32 - cyber boolean cyber boolean and boolean
07:36 - is one of our words of the day today and
07:38 - we're going to learn about that in a bit
07:39 - uh since khan academy has so much math
07:42 - instruction this week we're also going
07:43 - to have a math joke
07:46 - since oh wait you already said that okay
07:48 - what is the scariest kind of math
07:52 - the scariest
07:54 - kind of
07:56 - math tell me what is the scariest type
08:00 - type of math
08:01 - the aftermath
08:03 - what was that the aftermath
08:05 - the aftermath oh yeah okay that got a
08:08 - little dark we wrote that joke ourselves
08:12 - so we want to briefly meet our uh live
08:15 - audience we have a dozens of students on
08:17 - camera so we're going to switch to
08:18 - gallery mode so everybody can see all of
08:19 - them can everybody wave and say hello
08:22 - and we're going to mute you
08:34 - so there
08:35 - there are a few dozen students who are
08:36 - on camera but there's a whole lot more
08:38 - students over a thousand students who
08:40 - are joining us in live via the zoom
08:42 - webinar feature i'm going to screen
08:44 - share briefly so we can see on the map
08:46 - where everybody's
08:47 - from
08:49 - so you can now see a map which shows all
08:51 - around the world as people were dialing
08:53 - in they were putting in their locations
08:55 - and there's people joining us from as
08:56 - early as 7 00 am their time all the way
08:59 - till 2 a.m in the in the middle of the
09:01 - night and
09:02 - all around the world it's pretty
09:04 - incredible and sal just so you know we
09:06 - have students who are joining us as
09:08 - young as six years old and as old as
09:10 - folks who are in their later years older
09:12 - adults in their 60s or 70s uh the the
09:16 - experience level with computer science
09:17 - ranges all the way from beginner to
09:19 - advanced
09:20 - if any of you are joining us and your
09:22 - advanced students please be patient
09:24 - we're going to start with more easy
09:25 - stuff first and we'll we'll get to
09:26 - advanced stuff later and if you're a
09:28 - beginner and things move too fast for
09:30 - you don't worry you may not be able to
09:32 - keep up and learn everything but if you
09:34 - try you'll you'll get a little bit of it
09:36 - and then later on when you grow up uh
09:38 - you'll be able to re-watch and get
09:39 - better at it uh
09:42 - the other thing i want to say is as we
09:44 - go through this episode if you have any
09:46 - questions you can post them to code.org
09:49 - questions
09:50 - and because it's teacher appreciation
09:52 - week if you'd like to give a shout out
09:54 - to a special favorite teacher just like
09:56 - sal did please go to this url and submit
09:59 - something like a shout out put the name
10:01 - of the teacher and where you're from and
10:03 - what was special about the teacher we're
10:04 - going to read some of these out later on
10:06 - in the episode to say special thanks to
10:08 - teachers that have impacted us
10:10 - today we're going to be learning about
10:12 - conditionals
10:14 - which is an important concept in
10:15 - computer science and computer
10:16 - programming and there's going to be
10:17 - three parts
10:19 - boolean expressions flow charts and then
10:22 - we're going to learn about if and if
10:23 - else statements in app lab but before we
10:26 - get into the lesson what i want to do is
10:28 - to welcome some students to demo their
10:30 - creations each week uh when we have
10:34 - our episode we send challenges out at
10:36 - the end of the week for students to
10:37 - basically do some assignments and to
10:39 - share their creations with us and each
10:41 - week when you share your creations we'll
10:43 - invite you back on the next episode to
10:45 - share what you created and and so that's
10:47 - what we're going to be looking at now
10:50 - and let me share my screen in just a
10:52 - second
10:53 - to show the questions from this past
10:56 - week
11:04 - all right uh
11:05 - so here we have a creation from adit
11:08 - who's from bangalore india it's too late
11:11 - at night for adid because he's 10 years
11:12 - old but what he created was
11:15 - he used protocols to send binary
11:18 - information to create these pixel images
11:19 - to spell out coding is cool
11:22 - uh the other thing the other submission
11:25 - we have oops excuse me
11:29 - the other submission we have is from
11:31 - willow who's eight years old from
11:33 - whitley bay in the united kingdom and
11:35 - since we learned about protocols she
11:37 - sent she created a message sending
11:40 - protocol we're going to play her video
11:41 - briefly
11:54 - all right she's bouncing a ball
11:58 - and throwing it up in the air next
12:00 - letter
12:02 - right so
12:04 - willow's actually on the call with us
12:05 - willow are you there
12:07 - yeah
12:08 - could you explain to sal what you're
12:10 - doing in that video when you're bouncing
12:12 - the ball
12:18 - why were you bouncing the ball
12:22 - so instead of being placed at the light
12:24 - wasn't it so yeah you threw it up for a
12:26 - one
12:27 - were you sending it as a one or a zero
12:30 - was were some of the bounces of ones and
12:31 - some of them zeros
12:33 - yes so so the throw was a one the bounce
12:35 - was a
12:36 - zero there was a one and a bounce was a
12:38 - zero
12:40 - and then there was a click through
12:43 - the clicks were the time so you knew
12:46 - when the letter had finished
12:48 - and then you would go on to the next
12:50 - letter didn't you
12:53 - right well thank you so much for joining
12:55 - us willow i think willow's a little bit
12:57 - embarrassed to be in front of an
12:58 - audience of a thousand people uh is
13:00 - sylvia there with us as well
13:05 - sylvia
13:08 - i'm not sure if sylvia is on the call
13:11 - i'm i'm here
13:12 - hi sylvia where are you calling from
13:15 - kentucky
13:17 - and and what grade are you in
13:19 - fourth grade
13:20 - fourth grade can you tell us a little
13:22 - bit about your creation and what you
13:24 - sent into us
13:25 - well i made um endangered mammals of the
13:29 - arctic
13:30 - to bring
13:33 - to bring awareness about endangered
13:34 - animals to kids
13:37 - all right so you made this website uh
13:38 - what are these drawings did you make
13:40 - these yourself
13:41 - on google drawings
13:43 - oh cool and so there's polar bears or
13:45 - arctic boxes and if i click through i
13:47 - can get the actual real picture of the
13:50 - animals and to learn about these so we
13:52 - made a website about arctic animals and
13:54 - why they're endangered and you made
13:56 - little drawings of each of them and you
13:57 - can go them to see each of them and you
13:59 - made this entire website yourself on
14:01 - code.org web lab so if anybody missed
14:04 - last week's episode there's an html page
14:07 - for each of these pages so there's an
14:08 - html page for polar bears and html page
14:12 - for reindeer
14:13 - and silvia wrote the code for all these
14:15 - pages directly in weblab as she's
14:17 - learning html and css
14:19 - thank you so much
14:21 - to sylvia and to willow and to adit for
14:23 - sharing your creations sophia can you
14:25 - play an applause sound for our students
14:31 - right so now we're going to start
14:33 - learning about boolean expressions and
14:34 - conditionals and now the reason this is
14:36 - important is computers make lots of
14:38 - decisions both big and small for example
14:41 - when you're playing a game on a computer
14:43 - if you get a better score than last time
14:44 - you played the computer should change
14:46 - the high score or when you receive a
14:48 - call on your phone it fits somebody in
14:50 - your contacts you want to display their
14:52 - name or when you get an email if it has
14:55 - inappropriate content you want it marked
14:57 - as spam
14:58 - sometimes these could be big decisions
15:00 - that are made up of a lot of small
15:01 - decisions and how the computer works
15:03 - through those decisions involves
15:04 - something called
15:06 - boolean expressions which is our word of
15:08 - the day
15:09 - now south is is known for his ability to
15:12 - explain difficult difficult steps and
15:14 - difficult concepts in an easy to digest
15:17 - format so sal can you help explain to
15:18 - our students what a boolean expression
15:20 - is
15:21 - well i'll try and you set high standards
15:24 - but
15:25 - well a boolean is an expression that
15:28 - will result as either being true or
15:30 - false
15:32 - so
15:33 - for example if i were to say
15:36 - hadi is taller than sophia that is
15:40 - either going to be true or false that is
15:43 - a you could view it as a boolean
15:45 - expression
15:46 - uh we could we could actually pull
15:48 - people who thinks it's true
15:50 - so why don't we actually do this we're
15:52 - going to have sal read out a few boolean
15:54 - expressions and they're going to be
15:56 - either true or false
15:58 - and if you think they're true
15:59 - show a thumbs up and if you think
16:01 - they're false
16:02 - show a thumbs down so everybody who's in
16:04 - the on camera audience can do this even
16:07 - if you're not on camera you can do this
16:08 - at home
16:09 - and so sal uh why don't you give us a
16:11 - few examples of these boolean
16:13 - expressions
16:14 - true is thumbs up false is false thumbs
16:16 - up yeah well we could start with that
16:17 - warm up hadi is taller than sophia
16:21 - all right that was that was an easy one
16:23 - yes
16:24 - it results in a true it's a it's a so
16:26 - that's a boolean expression
16:28 - so i'll give you another warm up three
16:31 - is larger than four
16:34 - what do you think
16:36 - [Music]
16:39 - there's something interesting going on
16:40 - hobby i think a lot of people are seeing
16:41 - what other people are doing and so it's
16:43 - kind of a majority rule
16:45 - that's another phenomenon that we can
16:47 - see each other that's another phenomenon
16:48 - that we we can we can study yes of
16:50 - course that that is uh false
16:53 - okay the number of student panelists is
16:57 - greater than 10 true or false
17:04 - yes true we can clearly see in gallery
17:07 - mode many more than than 10 faces or and
17:10 - 10 thumbs up
17:13 - okay now we're going to get a little bit
17:15 - complicated uh what you're going to see
17:17 - is that boolean logic and when when
17:19 - you're coding and some of y'all have
17:20 - probably done this you're going to
17:22 - involve a lot of knots ands ors and so
17:26 - and that that starts to play with your
17:27 - head a little bit and computers are very
17:29 - good at it so we had to get we got to
17:30 - get good at thinking like that as well
17:32 - so we're going to combine some of these
17:34 - together to make a more complicated
17:36 - expression exactly exactly so the first
17:39 - one is
17:40 - the pacific
17:42 - is an ocean
17:43 - and
17:44 - the nile is a lake
17:47 - true or false for the whole statement
17:52 - all right so i'm seeing a lot of thumbs
17:55 - down and that's interesting because the
17:57 - pacific is an ocean
17:59 - so even though the pacific is an ocean a
18:00 - lot of y'all are still some okay there's
18:03 - a lot of confidence out there because
18:04 - yes it says and the nile is a lake and
18:08 - which we know that's false so we had a
18:09 - true statement and a false statement so
18:12 - the and since it was and the false
18:14 - statement made the whole thing false
18:16 - what if i were to say the pacific is an
18:19 - ocean
18:20 - or the nile is a lake
18:26 - yes that's a true
18:29 - that's a true because only one of them
18:30 - have to be true in an or both of them
18:32 - could be true as well but only one of
18:34 - them has to be true so that one works
18:36 - and then here we go
18:38 - a fish is a sea creature
18:41 - and a this is this is a i'm gonna read
18:43 - it carefully a fish is a sea creature
18:46 - and
18:48 - a cat is not a dog
18:56 - all right yeah because
18:57 - the way you do it the way at least i my
18:59 - brain does is i try to break down each
19:01 - of them i say okay fish is a sea
19:02 - creature okay that's true so i have
19:04 - something that's true and and then i
19:06 - read the next one a cat is not a dog it
19:08 - is true a cat is not a dog at least the
19:11 - cat's that i'm aware of and so have a
19:13 - true
19:14 - and a true
19:15 - and so that's going to be a true
19:18 - sofia has a cat that's definitely not a
19:20 - dog uh so let's do some of these as
19:23 - polls that the entire audience on zoom
19:25 - there's there's over a thousand people
19:26 - on zoom can try it as as well and we
19:29 - have two slightly more complicated ones
19:30 - that we're going to post at zoom poles
19:32 - uh those of you who are on facebook live
19:34 - or youtube live you won't see the polls
19:36 - where you can try answering them as well
19:38 - so so we could put up the first zoom
19:40 - pole
19:41 - and sal you can read it out
19:43 - okay
19:45 - five is an odd number and six is not
19:49 - even
19:52 - all right looks like i mean
19:55 - the group is definitely saying people
19:58 - are
19:58 - some not everybody's getting it right
20:00 - but i think people have the real hang of
20:02 - it uh but most of you have voted so if
20:04 - we could share the results so 95 of you
20:07 - got this right the the answer is false
20:10 - because 6 is even
20:12 - can we put up the next one
20:14 - and sal you can read it out as well
20:19 - not true this one plays with your brain
20:22 - not true
20:23 - is not false
20:27 - this one's tricky
20:30 - but our audience is doing a reasonably
20:32 - good job at it not everybody's getting
20:34 - it right
20:37 - sal do you know the answer to this one
20:39 - yeah well i'll tell you what my brain
20:41 - does when i read this i it does play
20:42 - with your brain a little bit when you
20:44 - read it the first time
20:46 - but you know instead of saying okay not
20:48 - true is not false what my brain says
20:50 - okay what is not true
20:52 - so if i say okay if something isn't true
20:54 - by definition it is false
20:57 - and so
20:58 - not true is false is a true statement so
21:01 - not true is not false is a false
21:04 - statement or i should i say not true is
21:07 - a not true is not false is a
21:10 - is a not true statement
21:12 - [Laughter]
21:14 - all right if we could share the results
21:16 - of what our
21:17 - team voted
21:18 - so 80 of you about got this correct uh
21:21 - for the rest of you that one was really
21:23 - a brain teaser and uh is a little bit
21:26 - kind of complicated
21:27 - so
21:28 - uh thank you so much for quizzing us on
21:30 - boolean expressions sal so we learned
21:32 - that we can combine multiple questions
21:34 - to make a complex decision and this is
21:36 - used all the time in computer
21:37 - programming or even life for example if
21:40 - i want to go hiking if if it's a weekend
21:43 - and it's sunny i'll go hiking and i need
21:46 - to check that both of those things are
21:47 - true in order to make my decision
21:50 - uh sal before we go into learning the
21:52 - next thing let's take a little break and
21:53 - learn a little bit about you uh you're
21:55 - our second special guest to play our new
21:57 - lightning round game so sophia is going
22:00 - to put 60 seconds on the clock
22:02 - and she's gonna
22:03 - ask you a bunch of questions quickly
22:06 - and sophia speak up so people can hear
22:08 - you well
22:09 - your goal is to beat our current high
22:11 - score of six which was set last week by
22:14 - keegan michael key so the quantity
22:16 - quantity over quality is what we're
22:17 - going for well you want to do both but
22:19 - your score is on the number but i'm only
22:21 - measured by quantity that's true
22:24 - are you ready sal i'm ready so if you're
22:27 - ready set go the best book you've ever
22:29 - read
22:31 - uh foundation isaac asimov
22:33 - what can always make you laugh
22:36 - uh
22:37 - parents probably won't appreciate this
22:39 - but potty humor
22:40 - country you've always wanted to visit
22:42 - behind
22:43 - new zealand
22:46 - what were your hobbies when you were a
22:47 - kid
22:49 - drawing
22:51 - your favorite
22:52 - smell rose
22:55 - favorite drink
22:57 - there's kind of a there's an indian
22:59 - drink called lassie which is like a
23:00 - mango type of smoothie sorry
23:02 - okay okay what are your feelings about
23:05 - pineapple on pizza
23:07 - it's great
23:09 - something you find yourself saying that
23:11 - your parents used to say
23:16 - i call my my my children weird words
23:18 - like dugubu
23:21 - first thing you do in the morning
23:24 - meditate
23:27 - okay it's time okay
23:30 - did i win
23:31 - you got a score of nine oh i think
23:34 - this app is doing an if statement now if
23:37 - your score is bigger than six then you
23:39 - have our new high score else you don't
23:42 - you know my meditation should make me
23:43 - not care about whether i want or not
23:45 - yeah that's true but you do now have our
23:48 - first time
23:49 - sophia you want to give him a round of
23:50 - applause for that
23:54 - all right i'd like to invite a special
23:56 - teacher who's joining us today in honor
23:57 - of teacher appreciation week flo are you
23:59 - there with us
24:03 - hello
24:05 - i'm here i'm here
24:07 - hi flo hi
24:09 - where are you calling us from
24:18 - i'm not sure if flo is there still
24:21 - [Laughter]
24:22 - you got me
24:24 - i'm still here
24:25 - all right we got you
24:27 - um okay great
24:30 - uh there you are so
24:33 - uh flo we had we wanted to ask you to
24:36 - share basically questions from our
24:37 - audience for sal could you read them out
24:39 - for us if that's possible i should
24:41 - i sure can so sad we have some questions
24:44 - from the audience and so first we have
24:47 - our revere in mumbai wants to know what
24:50 - prompted you to start khan academy
24:53 - oh that's a that's a good question and
24:55 - and nice to meet you flo and and thank
24:57 - you for being a teacher and the
24:58 - wonderful work you do uh
25:00 - so what prompted me to start khan
25:02 - academy i'll get i'll try to give the
25:04 - short answer i was always fascinated by
25:07 - education i was always fascinated by
25:09 - this idea that
25:10 - um you know some kids they seem to have
25:13 - all the capability in the world but for
25:14 - some reason they lose their confidence
25:16 - and i always thought that maybe it was
25:17 - it had nothing to do with their ability
25:19 - it had much more to do with it they just
25:20 - had gaps in their knowledge that you
25:21 - could fill in and so about 15 16 years
25:24 - ago
25:25 - one of my cousins who was 12 years old
25:27 - at the time so the same age as a lot of
25:28 - y'all it just came out of conversation
25:30 - that she was having trouble with with
25:32 - math in particular and so i offered to
25:34 - tutor her remotely she was in new
25:35 - orleans and i was in boston at the time
25:38 - and i saw with her the same you know
25:40 - that
25:41 - that if i
25:42 - filled in her gaps that she was able to
25:44 - learn anything
25:45 - and uh so then i was kind of hooked
25:47 - tutoring her so i started tutoring some
25:49 - other uh cousins word spread through my
25:51 - family that free tutoring was going on
25:54 - and i started making stuff for them as i
25:55 - said earlier you know my background was
25:57 - in computer science so that would
25:58 - empowered me to code some uh question
26:01 - generators for them and for me to be
26:03 - able to keep track of what they were
26:04 - doing and it was actually a friend that
26:06 - suggested that i start making some
26:07 - videos to supplement these things uh and
26:10 - i initially thought that was a bad idea
26:12 - i said you know youtube that's for cats
26:13 - playing piano that's not for real
26:15 - mathematics
26:16 - uh but i got over the idea that it
26:18 - wasn't my idea and i gave it a shot and
26:21 - so you know i started making stuff for
26:22 - my cousins and it started to become
26:24 - clear that people who are not my cousins
26:25 - were finding it useful and you know one
26:27 - of the really powerful things about
26:28 - coding is and and things like video is
26:32 - that they scale is that if it works for
26:34 - my 15 cousins maybe it could work for 15
26:38 - 000 people maybe it could work for 15
26:39 - million people and so in the back of my
26:41 - mind
26:42 - i said hey maybe this could be a thing
26:44 - that could reach a lot of folks i set up
26:46 - as a not-for-profit in 2008-2009
26:49 - and back then it was a little bit
26:50 - delusional i was in this walk-in closet
26:52 - kind of dreaming of creating uh
26:54 - something that could help the world it
26:56 - could help billions of people but we
26:57 - fast forward about 10 years since i quit
26:59 - my day job uh and you know khan
27:01 - academy's has about 100 million
27:03 - registered users and
27:05 - we are doing our best in conjunction
27:07 - with amazing partners like code.org and
27:09 - others and and amazing teachers around
27:11 - the world to try to empower as many
27:13 - folks as possible
27:16 - well as a teacher i can say that we
27:17 - definitely appreciate tools like khan
27:19 - academy
27:20 - being able to supplement the things that
27:22 - we do and to be able to fill in those
27:24 - gaps we have another question from
27:26 - another viewer in ashburn virginia and
27:29 - we want to or they want to know like
27:30 - what did you do in order to promote khan
27:33 - academy right like when you started it
27:35 - you know the online stuff was kind of
27:36 - still up and coming um are there any
27:39 - people who were reluctant to try it and
27:40 - how did you overcome that
27:42 - yeah you know a lot of people khan
27:44 - academy was one of you know they're in
27:46 - on the internet these days or even a
27:48 - while ago you always hear about things
27:49 - going viral where you know someone posts
27:51 - a video and then everyone starts sharing
27:52 - you know whatever else khan academy
27:54 - didn't really go viral it was more of
27:56 - kind of a slow word of mouth
27:58 - that i was putting stuff out there i
27:59 - think people back in 2006 2007 were
28:02 - doing web searches looking for help with
28:04 - things you know kind of i wasn't the
28:06 - first person to even make you know
28:08 - lessons on youtube uh but i think you
28:11 - know i there was something nice that
28:12 - maybe i was making for my cousins and so
28:14 - they felt very authentic uh and i think
28:17 - and people i think really resonated with
28:19 - with uh that i think so so that's how it
28:21 - grew and people started telling folks
28:23 - and whatever i didn't have any marketing
28:25 - budget or anything like that i think the
28:28 - the other question you know is how did i
28:30 - believe that this was worth doing
28:32 - because it is true that in the early
28:34 - stages of doing anything especially if
28:35 - you're doing something that is novel a
28:37 - lot of folks are going to look at you a
28:38 - little bit weird and say wait i don't
28:40 - know anyone who's done that why would
28:42 - that work uh and and so i definitely got
28:45 - a lot of that from friends and family
28:46 - i'd you know given up a good job uh that
28:49 - people thought was a legitimate job and
28:51 - i was living off of savings and my first
28:53 - son was born and so you know it was
28:55 - stressful and so you know you have to
28:58 - you can't always depend on everyone else
29:00 - believing in what you do you have to
29:02 - just say hey look i'm i'm getting some
29:03 - data here that this is this is
29:05 - beneficial for folks so i'm just going
29:07 - to keep sticking to it and keep
29:09 - believing in it and uh you know luckily
29:12 - it did eventually get enough traction
29:14 - that that folks started believing in it
29:16 - and started supporting it
29:19 - that's absolutely beautiful
29:21 - so thank you so much sal so as we had
29:23 - said earlier it's teacher appreciation
29:25 - week and we wanted to give some shout
29:26 - outs to the hard-working teachers who
29:28 - are finding such creative ways to to
29:31 - basically help keep their students
29:33 - engaged so we're going to share my
29:35 - screen for a second if you're if you

29:41 - question for us
29:42 - about your favorite teacher but i'm

32:02 - hi
32:03 - my name is gray i'm a seventh grader at
32:05 - aois rosemont and my favorite teacher is

32:36 - can everybody make a little heart like
32:38 - this for the teachers
32:39 - uh everywhere who are basically working
32:42 - hard teachers are doing some of the most
32:43 - important work in the world especially
32:46 - during this pandemic to keep our
32:47 - students uh engaged and learning thank
32:50 - you so much
32:52 - and unfortunately it's now time to say
32:54 - our goodbyes to sal sal thank you for
32:56 - joining us today and thank you for
32:57 - explaining bullying expressions to us
32:59 - it's an honor to have you join us on
33:00 - code break so could everybody wave
33:03 - goodbye to sal
33:04 - it was not not an honor
33:07 - it was not not an honor thank you well
33:10 - goodbye sal and we're going to continue
33:12 - on with flow
33:15 - flow can you quickly tell us uh you're
33:18 - you're a teacher in oakland right what
33:19 - is it that you teach in oakland
33:28 - math and computer science so can you
33:30 - tell us uh
33:31 - uh when you got into teaching computer
33:33 - science was it intimidating how did you
33:35 - get into it
33:38 - oh my wasn't intimidated absolutely um i
33:42 - think that at first i don't think of
33:44 - myself as a computer scientist um and so
33:47 - yeah when you look at tech companies you
33:49 - know you don't see a lot of people that
33:51 - look like me
33:52 - but i'm excited because computer science
33:54 - and mathematics have a lot of this
33:57 - i'm into computer science my math one of
34:00 - my
34:00 - co-workers introduced it to they were
34:02 - using a little turtle program to draw
34:04 - shapes um and i was helping them out
34:06 - with all the angles and things like that
34:08 - so
34:11 - the masks have a lot in common and so
34:12 - although it's intimidating i think that
34:14 - teachers should not be afraid because
34:16 - you know it's everywhere and we're all
34:18 - going to have to use it
34:21 - right so one thing that's exciting about
34:23 - flo is flo teaches at oakland school
34:25 - district and she began teaching computer
34:28 - science and then she helped get her
34:29 - entire school district this is an entire
34:31 - district where none of the classrooms
34:33 - none of the schools offered any computer
34:35 - science and just a few years ago thanks
34:38 - to flo's help every single school in
34:40 - oakland is now teaching computer science
34:42 - and it's become one of the most popular
34:44 - courses because flow helped prepare
34:47 - existing teachers in the existing
34:49 - schools whether it's math teachers
34:51 - english teachers history teachers or
34:53 - even art teachers begin teaching
34:54 - computer science so if you're in a
34:56 - school that doesn't offer computer
34:58 - science and coding whether you're a
35:00 - student or a parent you can ask your
35:02 - school's principal to send a teacher to
35:03 - code.org professional learning program
35:06 - so have them visit code.org and experts
35:08 - like flow will help prepare the existing
35:11 - teachers at the school to begin teaching
35:13 - computer science so when school starts
35:15 - again in the fall you'll have a computer
35:17 - science class and that's that training
35:19 - for the teachers is going to be
35:20 - happening over the summer
35:21 - so now we're going to go to the next
35:23 - section of learning about conditionals
35:26 - we're going to learn about flow charts
35:28 - and since uh flo is here uh with us
35:31 - she's gonna
35:32 - teach us about flow charts uh
35:35 - hello can you get get this going and
35:37 - share your screen tell us teach us how
35:39 - flow charts work
35:44 - share our screen here
35:46 - and of course we have to pick a teacher
35:48 - and make sure we turn our video on
35:51 - [Laughter]
35:53 - of course
35:55 - wait did i share
35:56 - uh you're not on screen sharia
36:08 - there we are
36:10 - okay so make sure we have our video
36:12 - right uh
36:14 - oh wait
36:16 - there we are
36:18 - yay okay so make sure you all can see me
36:21 - during fun with flow and flow charts
36:24 - listen you guys don't understand how
36:26 - excited i am to be doing fun with flow
36:28 - charts so we're going to play a game
36:31 - actually um that utilizes flow charts
36:34 - and some of the booleans that we learned
36:36 - about earlier remember the word of the
36:39 - day is boolean and a boolean is
36:41 - something that can be answered with a
36:43 - yes or no or true or false so we're
36:45 - going to be checking some boolean
36:47 - statements in this card game where we
36:49 - flip over cards and try to keep our
36:51 - score and see what our score is at the
36:53 - end of the game
36:54 - remember that our score always begins at
36:57 - zero
36:59 - so we have the first little diamond and
37:01 - then the first diamond our boolean is to
37:04 - check if the card is red so remember if
37:07 - it is red or it's not red right because
37:10 - the artist can be red or black
37:12 - and if the card is red and the statement
37:14 - returns true
37:16 - will you add
37:23 - we will subtract one from our score okay
37:25 - so this is the flow chart that we're
37:28 - going to use to play this game let's go
37:30 - ahead and play
37:32 - our first card is
37:34 - red three
37:37 - you're gonna
37:42 - our next card is going to be a black pin
37:46 - so again you're going to check the
37:48 - boolean to see if the card is red
37:54 - next we have a red seven
37:58 - a red seven so we're going to check to
38:00 - see if the card is red
38:05 - okay all right so that's the end of this
38:07 - round let's see what's our score do we
38:09 - have some participants who would like to
38:11 - share their scores
38:13 - so if anyone knows the answer just raise
38:16 - your hand we'll call on one of you
38:18 - let's see i see laurel raise your hand
38:20 - first so laurel i'm going to unmute you
38:23 - do you have the answer
38:24 - yeah i got one
38:27 - is that the right answer flo
38:31 - well yeah we're going to walk through
38:32 - does anybody else have a different
38:34 - answer or is there anybody else with the
38:35 - same answer
38:36 - let's see amishi
38:38 - um i got two
38:41 - oh amisha got two
38:43 - let's okay well let's go yeah let's go
38:46 - ahead and walk through and see um what
38:48 - happened so let's let's do this together
38:51 - so remember our score begins at zero
38:54 - and when we flip our first card we're
38:56 - going to check to see if the card is red
38:58 - and in this case it is true
39:01 - so we're going to add one to our score
39:03 - so now we have a score of one
39:05 - we are going to check our next card
39:08 - which was a black set a black 10
39:11 - so if the card is red no that's false
39:16 - so we're going to subtract one from our
39:18 - score so now we're back to zero
39:22 - our next card was a red seven so we're
39:24 - going to check is the card red and that
39:27 - statement is true
39:29 - so we add one to our score
39:32 - and we end up with a score of one yay
39:36 - congratulations to all of you who got a
39:38 - score of one
39:42 - so now we're going to
39:45 - add on to our flow charts and see what
39:49 - happens if we can um add more statements
39:52 - add more booleans to the flowchart okay
39:54 - we're going to play the same game we're
39:56 - going to have our cards we're going to
39:57 - flip our cards and try to keep our score
39:59 - but this time the flow chart is a little
40:01 - bit different we're going to start off
40:03 - by checking the first boolean in the
40:04 - diamond if the card is red if the card
40:07 - is
40:08 - red it returns true we're going to add
40:10 - one to our score
40:12 - else if the
40:14 - number
40:15 - if that's false we're going to check if
40:18 - the number is greater than six and in
40:20 - this case we're going to check that
40:21 - boolean yes is greater than six no is
40:24 - greater not greater than six
40:26 - it returns true
40:28 - then we are going to add two to our
40:31 - score
40:32 - if that boolean returns false we are
40:34 - going to subtract one from our score so
40:38 - a little bit more going on this time um
40:40 - and you all are going to play so
40:42 - everybody's going to play because i
40:44 - think this time we're going to do a poll
40:46 - for our score so everybody's going to
40:47 - play everybody on the zoom call
40:49 - everybody on youtube everybody's gonna
40:51 - play okay
40:53 - so let's play
40:55 - our first card is a black state
40:58 - you're gonna run through the flow chart
41:01 - check the color
41:04 - value
41:09 - our next card is going to be a red six
41:15 - so we're going to check against the
41:16 - color
41:19 - and we check against the value
41:26 - our next card is a red 10.
41:30 - so we're going to check is the card read
41:32 - chew our fauce
41:40 - all right
41:41 - next two i hope you all are keeping your
41:43 - score
41:49 - okay so let's take a poll
41:51 - and see what is the score so everybody
41:54 - go ahead and you're going to submit your
41:56 - score
42:00 - looks like most of the folks got the
42:01 - right answer but not everybody
42:07 - so about half of the students on the
42:09 - call have voted and about 70 of them got
42:12 - it right
42:13 - yeah all right almost everybody has
42:16 - picked their answer
42:18 - can we share the the student guesses on
42:20 - the screen
42:22 - yes let's share all right
42:27 - so it sounds like most people thought it
42:28 - was a three but a lot of people thought
42:30 - it was a four or five or a six
42:33 - so flo can you give us the real answer
42:35 - absolutely let's see what let's see what
42:38 - the real answer is going to be
42:40 - and the answer is
42:42 - [Music]
42:45 - so congratulations out there to all of
42:48 - you who got three let's go ahead and see
42:50 - how in the world we hit three
42:53 - score
42:54 - so remember we begin
42:57 - with the score at zero
42:59 - our first card was a black eight so
43:03 - we checked if the card is read that's
43:06 - false
43:07 - um is the number greater than six not
43:09 - string so we're going to add two to our
43:12 - score so you guys can see the highlight
43:15 - right so you can see the path that we're
43:16 - taking in the flow chart we're going to
43:18 - add two to our score so now we have a
43:20 - score of two
43:22 - our next card is
43:24 - so we checked the first boolean
43:26 - statement in the diamond is the card
43:28 - read yes that's true so we're going to
43:31 - automatically add one to our score so
43:34 - now we have a score of three
43:37 - our next card is a red 10 and so we
43:41 - checked the first boolean statement is
43:43 - the card read that is true so we are
43:46 - going to
43:47 - add one point to our score now we have
43:50 - score of four
43:53 - our next card is the black 2 so we check
43:57 - if the card is red no that's false the
44:00 - next boolean statement says or else is
44:03 - the number greater than 6 no that's
44:06 - false so we subtract one point from our
44:08 - score and we end up with the score of
44:11 - three so that is how we ended up with
44:14 - the score of three right so going
44:16 - through the two boolean expressions and
44:18 - following the half of the tree we ended
44:20 - up with three
44:22 - um let's have some more fun with some
44:25 - charts this time let's get copy and
44:27 - sofia involved this is gonna be
44:30 - we're going to this time still be
44:32 - dealing with our deck of cards but first
44:34 - we're going to check if the card is odd
44:37 - so our
44:39 - the card is odd and again that's a true
44:41 - false statement
44:43 - um if the card is odd true then sophia
44:46 - will give heidi a high five if the card
44:49 - is not odd or false
44:51 - then we have something else we can do so
44:53 - we're going to check to see if the card
44:56 - is a diamond
44:58 - so if the card is a diamond sofia and
45:01 - hottie are glowing
45:04 - if the card is
45:07 - not a diamond sophia and heidi will sing
45:10 - baby sharks
45:12 - okay so um
45:14 - let me came up with these
45:25 - [Laughter]
45:34 - [Laughter]
45:44 - okay here we go here we go look as you
45:47 - guys can see me looking at the cards
45:48 - okay i won't look all right let me pick
45:50 - another card oh no
45:53 - here's the card
46:00 - all right
46:00 - [Music]
46:02 - can we see it
46:04 - uh oh flow screen is frozen
46:06 - what card did you get
46:08 - it's
46:09 - the nine of clubs
46:11 - nine of clubs can you show it again
46:14 - nine of clubs
46:16 - yes all right so it's a
46:19 - it's it's an odd number oh perfect
46:21 - ready set
46:23 - okay stop there so we can see in the
46:25 - spring
46:26 - all right just give each other a high
46:28 - five sophia and i got off really
46:30 - worried we're gonna need to sing baby
46:32 - shark sophie do you want to sing baby
46:34 - shark anyway
46:39 - all right maybe not
46:41 - all right well thank you so much flo so
46:43 - flo showed us how if statements and
46:45 - flowcharts work and testing boolean
46:47 - expressions to be true now that's not
46:49 - something you do just on flowcharts it's
46:51 - a really important concept in computer
46:53 - programming and we tell the computer
46:55 - specifically what to do if something is
46:57 - true or false uh we're going to demo
46:59 - this uh soon in our app lab but first we
47:02 - want to do quick trivia time sophie are
47:04 - you ready for today's trivia question
47:09 - so let's put up today's trivia question
47:12 - how did boolean expressions get their
47:14 - name
47:15 - number one they were named after the
47:17 - famous boolean bridge
47:18 - option two
47:20 - the mathematician george boole invented
47:23 - them and option three once a ghost
47:26 - scared a computer science named leanne
47:28 - and named boo and yelled boo leanne
47:32 - i'll give you a hint option three is one
47:34 - that sophie and i wrote ourselves but if
47:36 - you like it you can vote for it even if
47:38 - it's not true
47:41 - i love that people are
47:43 - voting for the ghosts yeah that's what i
47:45 - did
47:46 - so you voted for two sophia
47:48 - all right so most of you have guessed
47:52 - let's share people's guesses
47:54 - and as most of you guessed correctly uh
47:57 - yet there is no such thing as a boolean
47:59 - bridge and there weren't and there
48:01 - aren't any ghosts ghosts are not real
48:03 - boolean expressions were named after
48:05 - george bull and some interesting facts
48:08 - to share george bull is a mathematician
48:10 - who lived during the 1800s he came up
48:13 - with boolean logic long before computers
48:15 - even existed
48:17 - two other interesting things about him
48:19 - george bull taught himself he actually
48:21 - didn't graduate from high school he
48:22 - taught himself math and reading and
48:24 - writing and then he actually started his
48:26 - own school as a teacher
48:28 - became a famous mathematician and then
48:30 - became a math professor at queen's
48:31 - college even though he never had any
48:34 - degree so those of you who are learning
48:35 - and studying at home you can get really
48:37 - far studying all by yourselves
48:40 - and then lastly if you think you are
48:41 - famous because boolean expressions are
48:44 - named after you
48:45 - george's wife was named mary everest and
48:48 - mount everest was named after her dad so
48:51 - this is a really unusual couple where
48:53 - one of them's had their name was made
48:55 - for boolean logic the other the world's
48:57 - tallest mountain was named after them so
49:00 - pretty interesting stuff so now that
49:02 - we've learned about boolean logic i want
49:04 - to go into app lab and show how we can
49:06 - use if statements and we're now in the
49:08 - third part of our episode where we're
49:10 - going to learn about if statements we're
49:12 - going to make an app
49:13 - right now on the show to use these kinds
49:15 - of if statements bye-bye sophia is going
49:18 - to say goodbye to us and i'm actually
49:19 - going to be joined by my son darius hi
49:22 - hi darius that was a quick switcheroo
49:24 - there is how old are you i'm 14 middle
49:26 - school you're 13 in middle school all
49:29 - right so we're going to do a quick
49:30 - screen share and show darius's screen
49:34 - we're going to show
49:36 - app lab over here and so this here
49:38 - basically shows the app that we're
49:40 - working on what you see on the left side
49:43 - of the screen is the app where we're in
49:45 - design mode
49:47 - and we can actually basically build the
49:48 - app on the right side of the screen
49:52 - oops my screen share messed up so i'm
49:54 - going to do that again i'm going to
49:56 - screen share again
49:59 - so what you see on the left side of the
50:01 - screen is the app that we're building
50:03 - and what we're creating is a magic eight
50:05 - ball so it's gonna look like this if
50:08 - you've seen in the video it's one of
50:10 - these eight balls where if you shake it
50:12 - it's going to give you a special answer
50:14 - that shows up uh like that and that
50:16 - answer is going to be basically to
50:18 - answer a question you ask a yes no type
50:20 - of question and it's going to tell you
50:22 - whether
50:22 - your answer is yes or not kind of like a
50:24 - crystal ball uh so first things first
50:27 - let's make this thing actually look like
50:29 - an eight ball so in this middle part
50:31 - we're gonna click on this big button
50:33 - this is a circular button but darius if
50:36 - you could actually change the button to
50:38 - have a black border
50:42 - okay so here we go and then change the
50:44 - border width it's two pixels wide can
50:47 - you make that a wider border
50:49 - okay yeah yeah much wider that's a thick
50:52 - border make it a little bit thicker oops
50:53 - what just happened what happened
50:56 - our page is reloading
50:57 - [Music]
51:01 - we're learning an important computer
51:02 - science concept called debugging
51:05 - all right i guess we need to start over
51:06 - go back into design mode
51:09 - and click the button
51:12 - and change the border color again
51:14 - [Music]
51:15 - to black
51:17 - and then the border width
51:18 - 75 that's like a nice number right so
51:21 - now we have our eight ball uh can you
51:24 - also change the font color in the button
51:26 - so uh
51:28 - basically a little bit higher up here
51:30 - the text color can you change that to
51:32 - whatever color you'd like i'll make it
51:34 - blue all right blue sounds good right so
51:37 - now we have an eight ball that basically
51:38 - when you click on that button we want it
51:40 - to do something so when you click on
51:41 - this we wanted to give us a kind of a
51:43 - yes no answer so if you could go to code
51:46 - mode and we're gonna write the code for
51:48 - what happens and it's going to have an
51:49 - if statement in there testing a boolean
51:51 - expression but first we want to check
51:53 - when the button gets clicked so drag an
51:55 - on event block
51:58 - and you're going to test and this on
52:00 - event block is going to be an event
52:01 - handler when the 8 ball is clicked so
52:03 - click the id and say when magic eight
52:06 - ball is clicked what are we gonna do we
52:08 - want to then basically pick a random
52:10 - number to decide a random answer that
52:12 - the eight ball is going to give us how
52:14 - many answers do you want it to give us
52:15 - three up to three different answers
52:18 - right so we're gonna pick a random
52:19 - number from one to three and store that
52:21 - number in a variable so click on
52:23 - variables
52:24 - and declare a new variable so variable x
52:27 - equals and then in that little blank
52:29 - spot we want to pick a random number so
52:31 - go into the math
52:32 - tab
52:33 - and choose a random number
52:36 - and if you want to have three different
52:37 - options you can go a random number from
52:39 - 1 to 3 instead of 10 but we can make as
52:42 - many as we want so now x is going to be
52:45 - a random number each time you click on
52:47 - the button we'll get a random number we
52:49 - want to test if x equals one and this is
52:52 - where we use our boolean expressions we
52:54 - can give one answer and if x equals two
52:57 - we can give a different answer and so on
52:59 - so go under control
53:01 - and pick out an if block
53:05 - and in that little blank part type x
53:07 - equals one but this is really important
53:10 - you need to use two equal signs
53:12 - because we're programming in javascript
53:14 - this is one of the most
53:15 - annoying and difficult aspects of
53:17 - computer programming is in many
53:20 - languages such as javascript c c sharp
53:22 - java you need two equal signs when
53:25 - you're testing the value of something if
53:27 - you use only one equal sign it's gonna
53:29 - break your code so
53:31 - if x is one we wanna show an answer for
53:34 - the magic eight ball so you can now set
53:36 - the text inside the button so go into ui
53:39 - controls and pull out the set text block
53:42 - so if x is one
53:43 - you want the magic eight ball to say
53:45 - something like uh do you want to give it
53:46 - a positive answer it will like yes so
53:48 - give like a stronger yes like definitely
53:50 - absolutely
53:52 - absolutely absolutely
53:56 - absolutely yes
53:58 - all right so if x is one it'll say
53:59 - absolutely yes so and if x is not one we
54:03 - want to do something else how do we test
54:05 - if x is not one uh flow can you help us
54:07 - out here what should darius do to
54:09 - to add the opposite case of the else
54:12 - clause if x is not one
54:14 - well if we want to add um the else
54:16 - clause then we need to click on the
54:18 - little plus of the
54:20 - uh if block and that will bring out the
54:22 - else and we can actually click on it a
54:24 - couple times so we can be able to add
54:25 - all of our statements inside that block
54:28 - like this all right so after clicking
54:30 - the plus twice so now you can test if
54:32 - this if so if x is not one else if x
54:36 - equals two and again two equal signs now
54:39 - we can put a different types of text so
54:42 - now set text
54:43 - all right so the you want a different
54:45 - answer like probably not
54:47 - probably not
54:51 - all right and then in the last case do
54:52 - we need to test if x equals three no
54:54 - because there is one other answer
54:56 - possible so it doesn't matter
54:58 - all right
54:59 - so now then you set text
55:03 - and change the text the magic eight ball
55:06 - to like nope or something
55:08 - nope
55:10 - all right so now we've got our magic 8
55:12 - ball uh built and we can play it so i'm
55:14 - going to run with this magic 8 ball and
55:16 - ask some questions about my son darius
55:18 - so
55:19 - did darius enjoy coding in front of an
55:22 - audience of a thousand people i'm gonna
55:24 - click
55:25 - oh that's sad nope no he did not oh come
55:27 - on uh does darius love computer science
55:31 - probably not
55:35 - does darius love his father
55:38 - nope
55:39 - darius
55:40 - uh is darius gonna come back on the next
55:43 - code break episode
55:45 - no okay at this point i should have said
55:46 - absolutely like the odds are against us
55:49 - is it gonna give us a good answer
55:51 - nope
55:52 - all right if i say something bad say
55:53 - something bad
55:55 - is darius gonna get punished
55:57 - probably not
55:58 - is it gonna rain today
56:00 - absolutely
56:01 - all right well you can see how simple it
56:03 - is to make this magic 8-ball game and uh
56:06 - if you want this on your own phone you
56:08 - can click the share button uh and then
56:11 - send to phone and it actually shows a qr
56:13 - code so if any of you are in the
56:15 - audience you can actually use your
56:16 - phones and scan that qr code and the
56:19 - magic 8-ball app that we built will be
56:21 - on your own phone and you can play it
56:23 - yourself
56:24 - if you don't scan it right now we're
56:25 - actually going to send this to you so
56:27 - you can actually make your own but i
56:29 - want to also show you how simple it is
56:31 - to use the exact same code to make a
56:33 - very different app than the magic eight
56:35 - ball
56:36 - so here's an app that's a dice game
56:39 - basically it rolls a dice and gives you
56:42 - an answer and you can see when you click
56:43 - the button roll dice
56:45 - it's going to pick another random number
56:47 - from 1 to 6
56:48 - it will play a sound and show the number
56:51 - that we rolled and if the dice value is
56:54 - greater than 3
56:55 - it'll say u1
56:57 - else it'll say you lost this is a lot
57:00 - like the card game that flow just made
57:02 - so if you roll the dice
57:04 - it gives you six and says you won
57:07 - and you roll the dice again it gives you
57:09 - a two which is less than
57:11 - not greater than three
57:12 - and i'll say you lost
57:14 - that's a super simple game but what's
57:16 - nice about this game is you can build on
57:18 - it and make it more complicated and
57:20 - we're going to ask you to try doing some
57:21 - of these things so for example here's a
57:24 - multiplayer version of it where player
57:26 - one gets one roll player two gets
57:28 - another roll and whoever gets a higher
57:30 - number wins so you roll the dice
57:33 - and player five wins and player two
57:35 - loses
57:36 - five sorry player one
57:39 - and you roll again and player two wins
57:41 - and you can make this even more
57:42 - interesting uh this is the more advanced
57:44 - version where each player gets two dice
57:47 - and instead of showing numbers they're
57:49 - actually going to show the image of a
57:50 - dice
57:51 - and so darius and i are going to play
57:52 - this i'm going to be player one and
57:54 - you'll be player two okay sounds good
57:56 - all right i'll roll the dice
57:59 - and i got a seven you got a seven so we
58:02 - tied
58:03 - and i'll roll it again
58:05 - i got five plus fours and nine so this
58:07 - time i finally won
58:08 - uh and as you can see you can add more
58:10 - to this you can make your game enter the
58:12 - names of the players instead of just
58:14 - being a win or a loser you can keep
58:16 - score and see how many scores a player
58:18 - gets these are basically all changes you
58:20 - can make super simply the beautiful
58:22 - thing about computer programming is it
58:24 - starts with just those few blocks but
