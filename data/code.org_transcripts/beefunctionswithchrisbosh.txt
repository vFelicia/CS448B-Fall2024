00:00 - One of the most important concepts in computer
science is how to define new commands, how
00:05 - to add your own words to a computer language.
Most computer languages have only about one
00:10 - hundred words or commands. The art and magic
is in defining your own new words out of these
00:17 - building blocks. We do this all the time in
sports. For example, in basketball, you start
00:23 - by learning how to dribble, how to do a lay-up,
how to rebound. Once you've learned these
00:28 - really basic moves, you learn new moves and
put together these building blocks, like a
00:33 - pick and roll or give and go. You can then
go from there to do more complex plays. Once
00:38 - you learn that play and give it a name, everybody
on the team knows how to do it. Similarly
00:44 - once you've taught a computer how to do an
action once using these sequences of commands,
00:49 - you can make up your own name for that action
so it's easy to repeat it later. When you
00:55 - define your own command and give it a name,
that's called a function. Now we're going
01:00 - to use functions to help the bee. In this
example, our function is called get 2 nectar,
01:08 - this green block right here. We know what
get 2 nectar does by looking at this grey
01:13 - box which is the function definition. If we
look inside there, the get 2 nectar is going
01:21 - to get nectar and then get nectar again. Always
look at what's inside the grey box so that
01:28 - you know what these green function blocks
can do.
