00:00 - Usually programming is all in text but we'll
use Blockly which uses visual blocks that
00:04 - you drag and drop to write programs.
00:07 - Under the hood, you're still creating code.
00:09 - To start off, we're going to build code for
a program that will help this Angry Bird move
00:13 - through a maze to get to the evil pigs that
stole its eggs.
00:17 - Blockly is split into three main parts.
00:20 - On the left is the bird's maze, where your
program will run.
00:23 - The instructions for each level are written
below the maze.
00:27 - This middle area is the toolbox and each of
these blocks is a command that the bird can
00:32 - understand.
00:33 - The white space on the right is called the
workspace and this is where we'll build our
00:38 - program.
00:39 - If I drag the move block to our work space
and press "run", what happens?
00:44 - The bird moves forward one box on the grid.
00:47 - And what if I want the bird to do something
after it moves forward one box?
00:51 - I can add another block to our program.
00:53 - I'm going to choose the "turn right" block
and I'll drag it under my move block until
00:58 - the yellow arrow appears.
01:01 - Then I'll drop it and the two blocks will
snap together.
01:04 - When I press "run" again, the bird will perform
the commands that are stacked from top to
01:09 - bottom on our work space.
01:11 - If you ever want to delete a block, just remove
it from the stack and drag it to the trash
01:15 - can.
01:16 - After you've hit run, you can always hit the
reset button to get the bird back to the start.
01:21 - Now let's get those pigs!
