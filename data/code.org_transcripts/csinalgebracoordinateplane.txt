00:06 - You're going to learn how math, like algebra
and geometry, can be used to develop video
00:12 - games.
00:13 - Some modern video games are incredibly complex,
with realistic graphics, physics, artificial
00:19 - intelligence and so on.
00:21 - Major video games can take large teams of
developers years to produce but you can apply
00:26 - many of the same concepts that the big developers
use to create a simple game of your own.
00:31 - Let's start by looking at a fairly simple
2-dimensional game.
00:35 - Each of the actors, or sprites, in this game,
can be described by their location or movement
00:40 - on the screen.
00:42 - Your job is to figure out how we can describe
the actions of each of these sprites mathematically
00:46 - in relation to the coordinate plane.
00:49 - Let's take a quick look at the game Plants
vs. Zombies as an example.
00:54 - If we have a zombie and a flower on the screen,
there are a few things we need to know about
00:58 - them in order to make the game work.
01:00 - Where's the zombie?
01:01 - In which direction is it moving?Where's the
flower?
01:04 - How far apart are they?
01:07 - As a player of the game, you might say in
general terms that they're on opposite sides
01:11 - of the screen.
01:13 - Or that the zombie is moving to the left.
01:15 - Or that the zombie and the flower are pretty
close to each other.
01:19 - These might be ok approximations but they
really aren't specific enough and they definitely
01:25 - aren't stated in a way that a computer can
understand.
01:28 - Suppose you were talking to your friend on
the phone, trying to tell them exactly where
01:32 - the dragon is.
01:34 - You could use words like on the left but that
isn't specific enough.
01:38 - If you had a ruler, you could measure from
the left side of the screen and tell your
01:42 - friend exactly how many inches away the dragon
is.
01:45 - That is exactly what computers do.
01:48 - Using a number line that starts with a 0 on
the far left and moving across the right measuring
01:52 - the number of pixels on the screen.
01:55 - For our video game, we'll place the number
line so that the screen runs from 0 on the
02:00 - left to 400 on the right.
02:03 - We can imagine the image of the dragon, stick
it anywhere on the line and measure the distance
02:08 - back to the left hand edge of the screen from
our dragon.
02:13 - Anyone else who knows about our number line
will be able to duplicate the exact position
02:17 - of the dragon know only the number.
02:21 - On the right side of the screen, the dragon
is at 400.
02:24 - In the center, he's at 200.
02:27 - What if we wanted the dragon to be off the
edge of the screen?
02:30 - We could use numbers bigger than 400 to place
him past the right hand side and negative
02:35 - numbers to place him past the left hand side.
02:39 - But even with a number line, we aren't being
quite specific enough.
02:43 - Even at 400, the dragon could be at the top
of the screen or at the bottom or anywhere
02:48 - in between.
02:49 - By adding another number line, we can locate
a character anywhere on the screen in either
02:54 - dimension.
02:56 - The first line is called the x axis which
runs from left to right.
03:00 - The second line which runs up and down is
called the y axis.
03:05 - A 2-dimensional coordinate consists of both
the x and y locations on the axis.
03:10 - Suppose we want to locate ninja's position
on the screen.
03:13 - We can find the x coordinate by dropping a
line down from the ninja and read the position
03:17 - on the number line.
03:18 - The y coordinate is found by running a line
to the y axis.
03:22 - With two numbers, x and y coordinates, we
can describe the location of any sprite on
03:27 - our screen.
03:28 - And by changing those numbers, we can get
our sprites to move around on the screen.
03:33 - What we've created is actually quadrant one
of the coordinate plane!
03:36 - If we zoom out, we can see that there are
four different quadrants to the plane: quadrant
03:40 - I, which we're using as our screen, contains
the points of positive values for x and y.
03:46 - Moving counterclockwise we get to quadrant
II which contains the points of a negative
03:50 - X and positive Y.
03:52 - Quadrant III contains all points with negative
X and Y and quadrant IV contains all points
03:57 - with a positive X and a negative Y.
