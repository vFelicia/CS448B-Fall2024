00:05 - in this activity you and your classmates
00:07 - will be acting as routers in a connected
00:09 - network of eight routers but you'll only
00:12 - have direct paths to three of those
00:14 - seven other routers so in the activity
00:16 - you can only speak to those three other
00:18 - people
00:19 - you'll have a series of conversations
00:20 - with the three routers you are connected
00:22 - to to exchange information about paths
00:24 - to other routers in the network
00:26 - these conversations are simulating how
00:28 - real routers learn about paths to other
00:30 - routers in the network that they are not
00:31 - directly connected to
00:33 - often it's easier to understand an
00:34 - activity by seeing a demo rather than
00:36 - reading about it and you're about to see
00:38 - a set of two conversations one between
00:40 - routers c and f and then a conversation
00:43 - between c and d
00:45 - hey i'm router f i'm router c uh and
00:48 - since you're f i'm going to be filling
00:49 - out the third column of my sheet to see
00:52 - your best paths to the other routers in
00:55 - the network
00:56 - do you have any connections to router a
00:59 - i do not yet have any connections to
01:01 - router a
01:03 - neither do i
01:05 - what about router b
01:07 - i have a connection
01:09 - of 10 to router b okay i'm going to
01:11 - write that down so it cost me 2 to get
01:14 - to you and it cost you 10 to get to b so
01:16 - it cost me 12 to get to b going through
01:19 - you um
01:21 - you are router c so i know how to get to
01:23 - you what about router d do you have a
01:25 - connection
01:26 - i do
01:28 - my shortest connection is five
01:30 - that means i can get to d with a cost of
01:33 - seven
01:34 - what about router e do you have a pack
01:37 - i have no paths to e yet okay i do with
01:40 - a cost of one okay so i can get to e
01:44 - through f with a cost of one it takes me
01:46 - two to get to u plus the one it takes u
01:49 - to get to e
01:51 - so that's three to get to e through u
01:54 - perfect i'm router f and i know how to
01:56 - get to myself but what about router g do
01:58 - you have a path
02:00 - i do not have a path to g
02:02 - okay i have a path to g with a cost of
02:04 - eight okay so it takes me two to get to
02:07 - you plus eight then for you to get to g
02:10 - so that's
02:11 - two plus eight is ten to get to g
02:14 - perfect what about router h
02:16 - i have no paths to h me
02:19 - either okay
02:22 - okay so your writer c i'm router c
02:25 - d okay uh do you have a path to a
02:28 - i still do not have a path to a okay
02:31 - well i can get there at a cost of four
02:32 - okay so through d it cost me five to get
02:36 - to u and then costs u four
02:38 - so five plus four is nine so now it
02:40 - takes me nine to get to a through u
02:43 - do you have a path to b
02:46 - i do it's a cost of ten
02:48 - okay so it cost me 5 to get to you plus
02:52 - 10
02:53 - is 15. i also have a path to b and it
02:57 - cost me 6. okay
02:59 - so it takes me 5 to get to u
03:01 - 6 it takes
03:03 - so that's 11.
03:05 - so that's not my cheapest but i do have
03:07 - it right through you now okay
03:09 - um u r c so i know how to get to u and i
03:13 - am d and you know how to get to me what
03:15 - about e
03:17 - i have a route through
03:19 - to e of a cost of three three okay so
03:22 - five plus three
03:25 - is eight
03:26 - uh that is cheaper than my current one i
03:28 - can get there at a cost of ten
03:30 - okay so it takes me five to get to you
03:33 - it takes you 10.
03:34 - so through you i could get to e with a
03:36 - cost of 15 but that's not cheaper than
03:38 - my current one do you have a path to f
03:42 - i do it's a cost of two
03:45 - five plus two
03:47 - is seven for me
03:49 - uh what about a path to g
03:52 - i have a path to g it's a cost of ten
04:00 - then do you have a path to h i have no
04:02 - path to h all right i can get to h at a
04:04 - cost of 12. okay so costs u 12 and takes
04:07 - me 5 to get to u
04:09 - so 17 to get to h
04:14 - remember that in the activity you can
04:16 - only talk to your three connected
04:18 - routers but you may find that if you go
04:20 - back to a router a second time they'll
04:22 - have new information about a shortest
04:24 - path that they've learned about have fun
