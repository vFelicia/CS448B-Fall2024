00:00 - An IF-ELSE statement is a decision between two things.
00:03 - So say for example, if it's a weekday, it's time to go to school,
00:07 - otherwise you can stay home and have fun.
00:09 - Now let's see how we can use an IF-ELSE statement with our zombie.
00:12 - This block looks the same as the IF block,
00:16 - but there's an extra part on the bottom that says ELSE.
00:19 - If I put a "move" block where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else",
00:24 - that means the zombie will move forward if
there's the path ahead,
00:27 - and if there's not a path ahead the zombie will turn left.
00:30 - It's making a decision and doing one of
the two actions based on that decision.
00:34 - And just like IF blocks you can put
IF-ELSE blocks inside REPEAT blocks.
00:39 - Now let's get those Zombies back to where they belong.
