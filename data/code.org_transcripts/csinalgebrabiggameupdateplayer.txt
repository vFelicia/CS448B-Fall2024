00:06 - Now that you're more comfortable using conditionals,
let's try using them in your big game.
00:11 - In order to get the player sprite to respond
to the keyboard, we'll need to use a conditional
00:18 - to check which key was pressed and then move
either up or down.
00:23 - Each key on your keyboard sends a unique number
called a key code to your computer.
00:29 - The update-player function will take in that
key code as well as the player's current y
00:34 - coordinate and return a new y coordinate that
is either greater or less than the previous,
00:41 - depending on key pressed.
00:44 - If you want to use the arrow keys to move
your player, you'll need to check for key
00:48 - code 38 for the up arrow and key code 40 for
the down arrow.
00:54 - If you want to use different keys for your
game, check the key code reference sheet from
00:59 - your student workbook.
