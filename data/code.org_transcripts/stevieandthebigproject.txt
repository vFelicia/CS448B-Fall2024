00:08 - Stevie is a very skillful squirrel.
00:11 - She is the fastest runner in her class and
one of the best spellers at her school.
00:17 - But today, Stevie is not happy!
00:20 - She has been working on a project and can't
seem to get anything right.
00:27 - "Oh no," Stevie thought to herself.
00:30 - "This isn't good at all!"
00:33 - Stevie could feel her face getting hot.
00:36 - She was worried that someone would look over
and see that she was failing at making her
00:40 - project and they wouldn't like her anymore.
00:44 - "I'm so mad!"
00:46 - Stevie screamed.
00:47 - "I'm mad at this project.
00:49 - I'm mad at the teacher.
00:50 - And I'm mad at myself!"
00:53 - With that, Stevie picked up her project and
smashed it on the floor.
00:59 - It broke into pieces and she began to stomp
it with her foot.
01:04 - Just then, Laurel came over to see what was
going on.
01:08 - "Stevie, what's the matter?"
01:11 - "I hate this project, and I hate this class!"
01:16 - "Oh, Stevie," Laurel said softly.
01:19 - "It sounds like you're frustrated."
01:23 - "Frustrated?"
01:25 - Stevie asked, confused.
01:28 - "Yes, frustrated," Laurel confirmed.
01:32 - "Being frustrated is a lot like being mad,
but usually it means you're mad because something
01:39 - is not the way you want it to be at the moment."
01:42 - "You might think you're mad at your teacher,
or yourself, or your project.
01:48 - You might even blame your anger on those scissors,
or a piece of tape.
01:53 - When you start feeling like you're mad at
everything and you just can't take it anymore,
01:59 - that's frustration."
02:01 - "But how do I get rid of it?"
02:05 - Stevie asked.
02:06 - "I never want to feel this way again."
02:08 - "Lots of things are frustrating, Stevie.
02:12 - The trick is knowing that frustration is a
good thing."
02:17 - "A good thing?!"
02:18 - Stevie was shocked.
02:21 - "Yes!
02:23 - Frustration is an emotion that lets us know
that we're about to learn something.
02:27 - When you're frustrated, it means that something
is not the way you want it to be.
02:32 - If you can figure out how you want it to be,
and then fix it, you will have learned something
02:36 - that can help you next time."
02:38 - "I don't think I understand," cried Stevie.
02:43 - "Think about it.
02:45 - When you were learning to ride your bike,
what happened?"
02:48 - Laurel replied.
02:49 - "I would get on my bike, push on the pedals
a few times, then fall over," Stevie said.
02:57 - "And how did that make you feel?"
03:00 - Laurel asked.
03:01 - "I was so upset!
03:04 - I cried, and I told my mom that I couldn't
do it!"
03:07 - Stevie frowned.
03:09 - "Then what happened?" Laurel prompted.
03:12 - "She told me to take a deep breath and try
again.
03:17 - Just a couple of times later, I got it!"
03:20 - Stevie said, beaming.
03:21 - "Then how did you feel?" Laurel asked.
03:25 - "I felt amazing!" Stevie squealed.
03:28 - "I was so proud of myself."
03:30 - "How do you think you would feel now if you
had quit the first time and never learned
03:36 - to ride your bike?" Laurel asked.
03:39 - "I probably would have felt upset at myself.
03:43 - Frustrated!
03:44 - And I would still feel frustrated every time
I saw someone else on their bike."
03:50 - "Exactly," Laurel exclaimed.
03:53 - "Frustration is really just a sign that you're
about to learn something amazing.
03:59 - If you give up before you learn that lesson,
you're left feeling icky and upset."
04:05 - "It sounds like you're also talking about
persistence," Jorge added.
04:11 - "Persistence is another word for not giving
up.
04:14 - If you try to solve a problem enough times,
in many different ways, eventually you'll
04:19 - get it!"
04:21 - "But if I try eight times before I get it,
04:24 - that means that I've failed seven times!" Stevie said.
04:28 - "Why do you think failing is a bad thing?" Jorge asked.
04:33 - "Everyone fails at things before they know
how to do them...just like you with your bike,
04:38 - or any baby learning to walk.
04:41 - You need to start thinking of the word fail
as a way to describe trying to learn."
04:46 - "I never thought about it like that!" Stevie exclaimed.
04:52 - "Just remember," Laurel began, "when you feel
frustrated, don't give up.
04:59 - Here are some tricks to help you feel better
so you can be persistent."
05:03 - "Count slowly to 10, take some deep breaths,
write your worries in a journal, talk to a
05:12 - partner about your feelings, and ask for help."
05:15 - "Once you've calmed down," Jorge added, "then
you can focus on being persistent and figuring
05:21 - out what's going wrong.
05:23 - Here are some tips to help you be persistent."
05:27 - "Keep track of what you've already tried.
05:31 - Figure out what is happening.
05:33 - Understand what is supposed to happen.
05:37 - Look at what that tells you.
05:39 - Make a change and try again."
05:42 - "Thanks, you two!" Stevie shouted.
05:45 - "I'm not feeling frustrated anymore.
05:48 - I figured out what went wrong with my project last time,
05:51 - and now I'm ready to be persistent and make it better."
05:56 - With a new attitude, Stevie finished her project
05:58 - and spent the rest of the class testing it out with her friends.
06:02 - The End.
