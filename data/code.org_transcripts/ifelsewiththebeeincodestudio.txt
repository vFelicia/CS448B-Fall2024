00:05 - We have a new block that's called the if/else
block. It's a conditional statement just like
00:10 - the if block you've used in the puzzles before.
But now there's a new part at the bottom that
00:15 - says else. The if/else block lets the bee
make a decision between two sets of actions.
00:22 - If the bee is at a flower, the bee will do
the set of actions you put in the first part
00:27 - where it says do. If the bee is not at a flower,
the bee will do the set of actions you put
00:33 - in the slot where it says else. If statements
are how computers are able to make decisions.
00:41 - Humans set up conditions for the computer
that say if the computer is presented with
00:46 - a certain situation do this. Else, which just
means otherwise, do that. The top of our if/else
00:55 - block says if at flower. But the top of our
block could say other things, like if nectar
01:01 - equals 2 or if there's a path ahead, our block
will behave in the same way. That if the statement
01:08 - at the top is true it will do the first set
of actions. But if the statement at the top
01:13 - is false, it will do the second set of actions.
