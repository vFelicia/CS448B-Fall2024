00:13 - This lesson is called songwriting with parameters.
00:15 - We're going to be writing some songs here.
00:18 - Sometimes the chorus is just a little bit
different each time you sing it.
00:21 - Do you remember Old Macdonald Had a Farm?
00:25 - The chorus is slightly different for each
animal.
00:27 - And on that farm, he had a cow, e-i-e-i-o.
00:32 - The small change in each chorus can be shown
using something we call parameters.
00:40 - Sometimes a function needs a parameter.
00:42 - A parameter is an extra piece of information
you can pass to a function to customize it
00:46 - for a special need.
00:48 - When you make ice cream sundaes with your
friends, you are using a process similar to
00:53 - parameters in a computer program.
00:56 - The disk of vanilla ice cream might be the
same for every sundae but when you ask your
01:00 - friends which two toppings they'd like, you
could get lots of different combinations.
01:06 - Topping is the function name but each type
of topping is a parameter.
01:10 - Functions and parameters work together to
make great computer programs and great sundaes
01:15 - too.
