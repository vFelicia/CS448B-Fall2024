00:11 - okay so um one of the vocabulary words
00:14 - that we learned last time
00:16 - was algorithm
00:18 - will you guys say that with me again
00:22 - and what does it mean who remembers
00:25 - from so long ago
00:27 - andy what does algorithm mean a list of
00:29 - steps that you can follow to finish the
00:31 - task okay the list of steps right
00:34 - i bet that you follow algorithms every
00:38 - single day and you don't even realize it
00:41 - is there an algorithm in this classroom
00:44 - that anyone sees
00:47 - a list of steps
00:49 - that you follow
00:51 - to get something done
00:54 - jack schedule
00:56 - the schedule
00:57 - right that's a list of things that you
00:58 - need to do all together at a certain
01:00 - time for this example
01:03 - is there anything else what do you think
01:05 - anya
01:08 - oh i wrote a step a list of steps for
01:10 - math
01:11 - that's an algorithm that you follow to
01:13 - get something done right
01:15 - i didn't i didn't i didn't even know
01:16 - that it's so awesome okay so i want you
01:19 - to think of a specific
01:22 - situation
01:23 - where you have to follow a list of steps
01:27 - to get something done
01:29 - so
01:30 - i'll plant the seed in your brain
01:32 - think about what does it take for you
01:35 - to get to school in the morning
01:37 - there's a whole series of events that
01:39 - happens
01:40 - right
01:41 - so if you were explaining your life to
01:43 - someone that didn't know you
01:45 - and you said well in the morning i go to
01:48 - school
01:49 - the person that didn't know you might be
01:50 - like well
01:52 - do you live at school
01:53 - do you eat at school do you take a
01:56 - shower or a bath and then get dressed at
01:58 - school or is school at your house like
02:00 - you you just go to school
02:02 - that's it
02:04 - aren't there a whole lot of steps in
02:05 - between
02:06 - yeah so who can
02:08 - start me off with a list let's do this
02:10 - together as a class
02:12 - let's make a list of steps we have to do
02:14 - to get to school in the morning arjun
02:16 - will you start us what's going to be
02:18 - step number one well maybe wake up and
02:20 - get out of bed
02:22 - okay let's title this getting to
02:25 - school
02:27 - getting out of bed
02:30 - okay so number one's gonna say get out
02:32 - of bed
02:37 - do you guys all agree with that you have
02:38 - to go from your horizontal position to
02:41 - vertical to get out of bed okay
02:43 - what's next ariane what's next
02:47 - and we can gen relax go to the bathroom
02:49 - a lot of people do that go to the
02:50 - bathroom or take a shower
03:02 - okay so there's our algorithm there's
03:04 - our list for getting
03:07 - from the morning time to getting to
03:10 - school there's all these steps did you
03:12 - realize
03:13 - that you were doing 11 steps before you
03:15 - got to
03:16 - school anyway some of you did yeah and
03:19 - if you break it down even further
03:21 - there's a million steps right so
03:24 - sometimes it's nice to generalize
03:26 - like with
03:28 - getting your supplies you don't have to
03:29 - list every single supply
03:31 - you understand that that's general term
03:34 - for what you're doing
03:35 - okay
03:36 - so what i want us to practice today
03:39 - is thinking about more steps and
03:41 - specifically
03:43 - i want you to think about the steps that
03:46 - you need to follow
03:48 - to make
03:49 - paper airplanes
03:52 - paper airplanes
03:54 - the steps that you need to make paper
03:57 - airplanes
03:58 - some of you are saying but i don't know
03:59 - how to make paper airplanes well that's
04:00 - perfect because we're going to learn how
04:02 - to make paper airplanes
04:04 - so i have a couple of things to hand out
04:07 - to you
04:08 - and in the first sheet
04:13 - you are deciding
04:15 - you're deciding
04:17 - the steps that you follow to make a
04:20 - paper airplane
04:22 - so you're gluing the six correct steps
04:27 - how many choices are there does anyone
04:29 - know can you do quick math how many
04:31 - choices are there on the paper scion
04:33 - nine there's nine choices
04:36 - and there's six correct steps
04:38 - so will there be x will there be
04:40 - leftovers yes okay so six steps
04:45 - right that's one one part
04:47 - and what are we doing with those steps
04:49 - are we putting them health or skelter
04:51 - we're putting them in order okay so in
04:53 - order
04:57 - and then what's next
05:00 - trade
05:03 - okay so we'll trade after that
05:10 - trade your finished algorithm
05:13 - with another person or group and let
05:15 - them use it to make an actual flying
05:18 - paper airplane
05:20 - dramatic gasp
05:23 - paper airplanes
05:24 - okay so you'll trade it and then your
05:26 - partner will make an actual
05:29 - airplane
05:33 - i would love to make an airplane
05:35 - okay so does this help you to review our
05:38 - steps
05:39 - right these are the important bits if
05:40 - this was model drawing math this would
05:42 - be our important important bits
05:45 - yeah so let's do this
05:52 - so for this activity it takes a long
05:54 - time for the kids to cut out the steps
05:56 - themselves so if you want to do this
05:58 - quicker it'd be worth cutting out the
06:00 - steps and giving each kid an envelope
06:02 - with the steps cut out that takes that
06:04 - difficulty out of it and you can get
06:06 - through the lesson a little quicker
06:13 - something else you could use instead of
06:15 - folding paper airplanes for this
06:17 - activity is
06:18 - planting a seed following steps to plant
06:20 - a seed or anything origami that is
06:23 - folding paper is easy to get
06:38 - if you could add anything
06:41 - to the list of instructions that we had
06:43 - what would you have added
06:46 - arjun what do you think i would add
06:48 - decorate
06:50 - because i mean might look better with
06:51 - this stuff
06:52 - okay so we could add decorate on
06:55 - that'd be a good one to add i can write
06:57 - that in
06:58 - a different color
06:59 - these are things that we could add to
07:01 - this to this list
07:06 - decorate what else would you add or
07:08 - change i heard some kids saying that it
07:10 - was difficult
07:12 - to make the paper airplane out of the
07:14 - same paper that had the instructions on
07:15 - it yeah would you change that
07:18 - would in your instructions would you say
07:21 - get another piece of paper to make the
07:23 - paper airplane yeah
07:26 - it is wasting trees you'd have to decide
07:28 - what's important
07:29 - so could i write get another piece of
07:31 - paper question mark yes okay
07:39 - okay those are some great ideas
