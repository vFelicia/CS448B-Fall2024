00:00 - No matter what field you end up going into,
00:03 - it's quite likely that AI is going to 
have some impact on what you're doing.
00:07 - The potential for AI to help society is enormous!
00:09 - It's something that is influencing a lot of
00:12 - very important decisions about 
real humans and their lives.
00:15 - It could be used in education, to be more of an 
equalizer between people. It could be used in
00:20 - healthcare to develop new drugs. It could be 
used in science to develop new technologies.
00:25 - Like any technology its application 
will depend on how it is utilized.
00:30 - At the same time, we need to think about 
the risks that are associated with doing
00:34 - that. The consequences are huge! The kind 
of artificial intelligence technology
00:46 - that really dominates the applications 
we're seeing today is machine learning.
00:51 - Machine learning depends entirely 
on the information that you feed it.
00:55 - The problem is that with real world data, there's 
often information in there that you didn't intend
01:02 - to be in there, but is captured because of 
the bias in the data collection process.
01:07 - So if you're building an AI to 
determine who gets a home loan,
01:10 - or who should be charged with 
a crime, it could definitely
01:14 - bubble up the racial biases that humans 
and our current society already does.
01:23 - A lot of what it means to build less harmful 
AI is really systems that are including the
01:30 - perspectives of those that are most vulnerable 
or most marginalized, most likely to be hurt
01:34 - by the deployment of that system. In many 
ways I've worried that the people who are
01:39 - particularly vulnerable to AI are the people who 
are already underprivileged in many respects.
01:49 - Most people in the world 
just have AI applied to them,
01:52 - rather than playing an active role 
in guiding what AI gets applied to.
01:58 - Everybody you know has a computer in their pocket. 
That's young people, old people, rich people,
02:05 - poor people. To me, that's actually quite exciting 
from a democratization of technology perspective.
02:13 - It means that AI, powerful as it is,
02:16 - could theoretically be in everybody's 
pockets, benefiting everybody. We should
02:22 - strive to make sure that things that provide 
value for society can be reached to anybody.
02:31 - How do we give a greater voice to the 
people who are being impacted by AI,
02:36 - to in turn be able to turn around 
and impact how AI is used for them?
02:43 - Every time when you're looking at a new problem, 
you have an opportunity to change the world.
02:47 - Sometimes we succeed, sometimes 
we don't, but we always try.
02:53 - It's really critically important that we have 
as many diverse perspectives as possible,
02:58 - influencing the development of AI.
03:00 - We need the participation of 
more women, more people of color,
03:04 - to provide a different perspective and a different 
lens on which problems matter and how we should
03:08 - approach these
problems.
