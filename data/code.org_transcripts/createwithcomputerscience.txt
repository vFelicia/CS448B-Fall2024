00:00 - well I think creativity plays a role in
00:02 - almost everything that we do from
00:04 - cooking to making music which is what I
00:08 - do but in computer science you have to
00:10 - have a creative mind
00:11 - [Music]
00:12 - computer science it is Art and everybody
00:14 - has a different style and I think that
00:16 - that's a beautiful thing about computer
00:17 - science is that it's flexible as you
00:20 - iterate through code and you start
00:21 - seeing what experiences you're lighting
00:22 - up it is just like a piece of art when
00:24 - you read someone else's code it's almost
00:26 - like reading poetry you try to follow
00:29 - how their mind went about solving a
00:32 - problem
00:34 - no art exists without technology a
00:37 - paintbrush is a piece of technology a
00:39 - typewriter is a type of technology so as
00:41 - we keep coming up with new types of
00:44 - Technology artists are always going to
00:46 - come in and find some new ways to use it
00:48 - in ways that are unexpected there is no
00:50 - creativity without technology and
00:52 - Technology does not exist without
00:53 - creativity
