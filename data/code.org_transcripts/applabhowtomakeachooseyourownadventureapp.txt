00:03 - So one of the “funnest” programs that I
00:05 - like to make is a choose your own
00:06 - adventure game just because I like
00:08 - combining the creativity with a little bit
00:11 - of code and we made one for you in the
00:13 - sample apps, so if you want to go into the
00:15 - sample apps and check it out you can go
00:17 - start with that and make
00:18 - your own from there.
00:20 - But right now, I’m going to show you how
00:21 - to do one on your own getting started,
00:23 - starting with nothing. So, what I’ve got
00:25 - here is – I’m right here in code studio
00:28 - and I like to start in design mode.
00:30 - Because in design mode, I can start by
00:32 - just designing the app without even
00:34 - thinking about what the code is going to
00:35 - look like. The first screen in my app is
00:37 - to be the first question in my “Choose
00:39 - your own adventure”, so let’s pull some
00:41 - text out there and let’s say, erm, “You
00:45 - wake up, you’re in a desert”, because that
00:49 - seems like a place you would wake up –
00:51 - “You see a skateboard and a camel.
00:56 - - Which one do you take?”
01:01 - That seems like a reasonable question -
01:03 - let's increase the text size of this
01:05 - because I want it to look a little bit
01:07 - bigger - it's nice big question right here
01:10 - and I’m going to drag it right into the
01:11 - middle and now I’m going to add 2 buttons.
01:14 - Button one is going to be for Skateboard
01:16 - so we’ll change the text of that one to
01:18 - say stake – didn’t spell that right -
01:20 - skateboard and the id of that one is going
01:23 - to be skateboard, so I can remember which
01:25 - button it is and then I’ll make that
01:27 - button a little bit bigger. I feel like
01:30 - skateboard should be purple for some
01:32 - reason so I'm going to make it a nice big
01:35 - purple button and then let's add a button
01:37 - for camel! Also a good choice if you wake
01:42 - up in the desert - Camel - and the id of
01:46 - that one I’m also going to make camel and
01:50 - now I’m going to make that one big, make
01:52 - them of equal size so people don't know
01:53 - which one to pick. Now I’m going to go
01:55 - design the next screen before I write any
01:57 - code, before I make it go anywhere or do
01:59 - anything, I’m just going to go ahead and
02:01 - design the next screen that’s going to
02:02 - happen. So let’s go to new screen and
02:05 - let’s make this our… no button, I don't
02:08 - want a button. We’re going to use some
02:11 - more text. We’re going to make this our
02:15 - our... we'll make this one our
02:17 - Camel screen. So what happens if you’ve
02:19 - got a camel – so let’s see – if you’ve
02:21 - got a camel and you go into the desert -
02:23 - seems like a good choice! It was a long
02:27 - hard slog. After five days of treking
02:33 - through - spelled trekking wrong – let’s
02:36 - go for wandering – wandering through the
02:38 - desert you eventually make it to the city.
02:45 - Congratulations!
02:49 - And make that nice and big, let’s go with
02:54 - font size up here – nice big font and
02:57 - there we go – that is screen two and what
03:00 - I want to do next is add some pictures,
03:02 - add some backgrounds, but for right now,
03:04 - just teaching the basics of how to get
03:05 - coding, so I’m just going to move on and
03:07 - add another screen. This is the screen
03:10 - where the person picked the skateboard.
03:14 - If he picked up the skateboard – I think
03:17 - he died! I don’t think – I don’t think
03:21 - skateboards are a good choice for the
03:22 - desert. We’ve got our “You Died.” Screen,
03:27 - so now, if you look up here, you can see
03:29 - we’ve got three different screens – we’ve
03:30 - got our intro screen, we’ve got the screen
03:33 - we want to go to if you choose camel and
03:35 - we’ve got the screen we want to go to if
03:36 - you choose skateboard. And I’ve labelled
03:40 - them differently – so let’s redo that
03:43 - labelling. Let’s call this
03:45 - “skateboardScreen”, so that they are all
03:47 - labelled in the same way.
03:50 - Now, let’s go back to our intro screen,
03:52 - and let’s actually make these buttons work
03:55 - So what I want to happen is I want when I
03:57 - click on the skateboard button, I want it
03:59 - to go to the skateboard screen. As you can
04:02 - see here, when I click on the
04:03 - skateboard button, I get all these
04:04 - different properties – I can set the text,
04:06 - I can set the height, the width of the
04:08 - button, I can set the colour, background
04:10 - colour of the button, but there’s also
04:12 - this other tab next to properties for
04:14 - events. Now an event is something that can
04:17 - be called when you interact with an object
04:20 - So, if I have a text input object, then I
04:23 - might get an event when they change the
04:25 - text in it or when I, erm, when I interact
04:28 - with it in another way, like click on it.
04:30 - For a button, the main event that we care
04:32 - about is clicking on the button and as you
04:34 - can see here, under events, for button,
04:36 - I’ll see that there is a click event.
04:38 - Underneath that, I can see that it’s
04:40 - triggered when the button is clicked with
04:42 - a mouse or tapped on the screen.
04:43 - Perfect – I’m going to click “Insert and
04:46 - show code”, and it’s automatically going
04:47 - to put the code into our program so that
04:49 - when the skateboard button is clicked, it
04:52 - will let me know that the skateboard
04:54 - button is clicked. This function is going
04:56 - to run right here, and what it’s going to
04:57 - do is it’s going to log into the console,
04:59 - that I’ve clicked the skateboard button.
05:01 - Let’s try it – I click run, I click on
05:03 - skateboard, and right down here to the
05:05 - console, I can see that it logged that
05:06 - I’ve clicked the button. It’s a good start
05:09 - but I don’t want to actually just want to
05:10 - log to the console. What I really want to
05:12 - do is switch screens! So, let’s get rid of
05:14 - this “log into console” line right here
05:17 - and under UI controls at the very
05:19 - bottom, you can see a function right here
05:21 - for setting the screen. I’m going to go
05:23 - grab that, put it over here, and when the
05:25 - skateboard button is clicked, I want to
05:27 - switch to the skateboard screen. Now I’m
05:29 - going to do the same thing for the camel.
05:31 - Let’s go back to design mode and on the
05:34 - camel button, we’re going to insert and
05:36 - show code. Instead of logging to the
05:39 - console that the camel button was clicked,
05:41 - what we are going to do is we’re going to
05:44 - set the screen to our camel screen. There
05:50 - we go! Should we try it out, click run,
05:52 - and if I click camel - I win the game!
05:56 - Which is fantastic! If I reset my game
06:00 - and I run it again and I click skateboard
06:04 - – I die! Which is sad, but it makes sense,
06:06 - because I’m using a skateboard in a
06:07 - desert. So, hopefully you guys can invent
06:10 - your own games that are more fun and more
06:13 - interesting than this one and you can
06:15 - again check it out on our app lab page
06:17 - and there’s a list of apps and a longer
06:19 - “choose your own adventure” game that you
06:21 - can use to get started. Thanks!
