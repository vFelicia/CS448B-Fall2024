00:06 - Suppose we want to make an image of fifty
identical solid red triangles.
00:11 - To do so, you'd have to create this evaluation
block fifty times.
00:16 - Even worse, what if you decided you wanted
fifty blue triangles instead?
00:21 - You'd have to go through and change each and
every block.
00:24 - There must be a better way.
00:26 - What we need is a shortcut, some way to reference
our fifty pixel solid red triangle so that
00:32 - we can just ask for it fifty times.
00:35 - And if we wanted to change it, we'd only have
to do it in one place.
00:39 - We can do that by giving our block of code
a special name.
00:42 - Let's call it My Triangle.
00:45 - That name is shorthand for the block of code
that returns our fifty pixel solid red triangle
00:49 - and we can refer to My Triangle any time we
want.
00:53 - The name My Triangle is called a variable.
00:55 - A special name given to a value so that it
can be referenced repeatedly throughout a
01:00 - program.
01:01 - By using variables, you can write programs
that are more flexible and return different
01:06 - values depending on the value of your variables.
01:09 - In this next stage, you'll define variables
that can be used multiple times and change
01:14 - for each use throughout your programs.
01:16 - It gets pretty cool.
