00:05 - My name is Jordan and I'm Lakota and Nez Perce. I am also Hopi and Mojave
00:12 - And Iead a team called Global Outsourcing at Pinterest.
00:16 - You’re about to get started with Play Lab,
which is a tool that lets you make your own
00:20 - stories and games by writing code!
00:23 - Playlab has a bunch of characters you can
pick, called “actors”.
00:28 - Actors can move, say things,
and interact with each other.
00:38 - Your code lets you control the actors, add
sounds-and-backgrounds, score points and more!
00:47 - You’ll drag code blocks into your workspace
to build programs.
00:52 - Code that you connect to the orange “when
run” block will make things happen as soon
00:58 - as you press the run button.
01:04 - To make your program react when someone plays
with it you're going to use events.
01:11 - These blocks are called event blocks.
01:16 - When we code with events, we are telling the
computer to wait for something to happen, and then respond right away.
01:35 - The code connected to an event block runs
when the player presses a key, taps or clicks
01:44 - an actor, or when one actor touches another actor.
01:56 - Event blocks can go anywhere in your work
space.
01:59 - They never connect to the when run block,
so it’s okay to leave them off to the side.
02:08 - Take your time and think carefully about how
you want your program to work.
02:13 - When you’re finished you’ll have something
special that you can share with others.
02:18 - Now, what do you want to create?
