00:05 - We just created a simple survey app, that
asks the user for their favorite food,
00:09 - and stores the answer in a remote database. Specifically, the fave foods table.
00:13 - To view the entry stored in the database, click the View Data button above the app display.
00:18 - When you click the button, it will open a new tab for the data viewer.
00:21 - The first thing the data viewer shows you is your list of tables in the database, and look!
00:26 - There's the fave foods table, which automatically got created the first time we used to createRecord with that table name.
00:32 - New tables can be added on his page but we're going to dive into the fave foods table.
00:38 - Here we see how the 3 foods we submitted earlier each show up as a row in the Fave Foods table.
00:43 - The data viewer lets you look at the data in any table, and modify it manually if you like.
00:48 - Click edit next to a row, and you can change the contents.
00:51 - You can add or delete columns if you need to, or add a whole new record.
00:57 - Below the table, is a section called "debug view" of the table, where you can see the Javascript objects being
01:00 - created as you add elements to the table.
01:05 - This makes it easy to see that at the heart
of the table is just a list of Javascript objects.
01:09 - You will notice that column names are properties of the object, and the values are the items in the row for that record.
01:16 - When thinking about how to build an app, you may need to keep track of something while your app is running.
01:22 - For this, use the concepts you're familiar with, like variables or lists.
01:27 - If you want some data to be accessible after the app stopped running, or for multiple users of an app,
01:32 - you'll use the permanent data storage blocks to send that data to a remote database.
01:37 - My first job out of college was to work at Industrial Light & Magic, which is George Lucas's company.
01:42 - I was working on the special effects for Terminator 2, to help make the terminator's body melt into a puddle of metal,
01:47 - and I worked on Jurassic Park to make all the dinosaurs belly wiggle,
01:51 - We had all these amazing artists, animators, and technical directors that worked on these movies.
01:56 - They would have little problems like if I wanna make the dinosaur's belly move:
01:59 - it's made out of a mesh with a thousand
little points, to make that wiggle frame-by-frame,
02:04 - they would literally have to reposition each one of those points by hand.
02:08 - I said Wait a second, I think we can do that with physics and math. We can say "If the belly is here,
02:12 - and it's this much weight swinging this way, can we change it so it automatically computes where all those things would be?"
02:18 - You could save them days and weeks of time by applying a bit of software.
02:21 - That definitely got me hooked on the power of software to make people's lives better.
