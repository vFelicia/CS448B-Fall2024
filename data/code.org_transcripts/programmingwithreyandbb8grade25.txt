00:07 - Rey needs BB-8's help!
00:09 - In these puzzles you'll program BB-8 using the "move" and "turn" blocks
00:13 - from the toolbox.
00:15 - BB-8 needs to pick up each piece of scrap metal
00:17 - to finish the puzzle.
00:19 - First work to find a path for BB-8 that covers
00:22 - all the pieces of scrap metal.
00:24 - Then write the program in your workspace
00:26 - to move BB-8 on that path.
00:29 - You don't need a special command to pick up scrap metal.
00:32 - BB-8 will collect it just by moving over
the top.
00:35 - Now let's get rolling!
