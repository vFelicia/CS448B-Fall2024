00:10 - hi my name is menika i work at aws
00:13 - internet of things and i'm a software
00:15 - development engineer there coding in
00:18 - general and software engineering is just
00:20 - thinking about what is the simplest and
00:23 - most efficient way of doing things
00:25 - this doesn't have to be a male dominated
00:28 - field at all like women can easily do
00:30 - what the men can do here
00:33 - when we use our phones or computers we
00:36 - are constantly interacting with
00:37 - technology
00:39 - these interactions are important because
00:41 - through them we can control our devices
00:45 - say as software engineers we were asked
00:48 - to develop some code for a phone
00:51 - we might want to ask what a user's
00:53 - favorite color is and update the
00:55 - background to that color
00:58 - let's see how we can get and use user
01:00 - input
01:02 - to get user input
01:04 - we use a class called scanner
01:07 - scanner is a built-in class in java
01:10 - which includes methods we use to get
01:13 - information from the user
01:15 - it can read user inputs of all different
01:18 - types
01:19 - at the top of our code we want to have
01:22 - an import statement
01:24 - this is what allows us to use the
01:26 - scanner class in our code
01:28 - we create objects using the scanner
01:31 - class the same way we create any object
01:34 - in java
01:36 - here we have a variable named input
01:39 - which is one of the type scanner
01:42 - just like other variables you can name
01:45 - this variable anything you want
01:48 - just make it descriptive
01:50 - when we initialize the scanner object we
01:53 - call a constructor from the scanner
01:55 - class
01:56 - we use a constructor that has an
01:58 - argument of system dot in
02:01 - this tells the computer that our scanner
02:04 - object will look for input from the
02:06 - keyboard
