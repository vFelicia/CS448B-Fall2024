00:05 - This lesson is functional suncatchers.
00:08 - You'll be creating these pretty suncatchers
using functions.
00:12 - There are several steps in creating one of
these suncatchers.
00:16 - Some of the steps you have to repeat many
times.
00:18 - The first step in simplifying the process
of making a suncatcher is figure out what
00:23 - we have to repeat over and over again.
00:26 - We can group these steps into what we call
a function.
00:30 - But there is more to creating a beautiful
suncatcher than following precise steps.
00:35 - Sometimes we want to be creative and change
the color of the beads we're using.
00:40 - We can make every suncatcher unique if we
use different colored beads.
00:45 - Your suncatcher will be uniquely yours when
you learn to think of the beads as variables
00:50 - which is a word that means a placeholder for
information that can change.
00:55 - Have fun creating beautiful suncatchers using
functions and variables!
