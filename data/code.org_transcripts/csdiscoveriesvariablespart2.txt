00:07 - in the first variables video we learned
00:09 - how to create a variable
00:11 - assign it a value and then use it in a
00:13 - program
00:15 - now let's add some complexity one of the
00:17 - most powerful things that you can do in
00:19 - a programming language is use variables
00:22 - in expressions for example
00:24 - var new score
00:26 - new score equals score plus hundred with
00:30 - this code we're creating a new variable
00:32 - called new score
00:34 - but we're not just assigning it a number
00:36 - like we have in the past to calculate
00:38 - the value of our new variable the
00:40 - computer must first retrieve the value
00:42 - of the variable score from memory and
00:45 - then add a hundred to it
00:46 - the resulting number is the value of new
00:49 - score
00:50 - what if we want to create a game where
00:52 - we increase the user's current score by
00:54 - one point every time a coin is acquired
00:58 - we could do this by updating the values
01:00 - stored inside the variable score based
01:02 - on its current value like this
01:06 - this line of code can be read as score
01:09 - gets the current value of score
01:11 - plus one
01:13 - so if the current score is seven and the
01:15 - user requires a coin
01:17 - the computer must retrieve the current
01:19 - value of the score which is seven add
01:21 - one to it making eight and then store
01:23 - the new value back into memory similarly
01:26 - in our game if the player does something
01:28 - bad
01:29 - we might want to reduce the number of
01:30 - lives by one so that code would look
01:32 - like this lives equals lives minus one
01:36 - or lives gets lives minus one
01:39 - this process of updating a variable is
01:42 - called variable reassignment
01:44 - understanding how variables are set and
01:46 - updated is a powerful key that unlocks
01:48 - many insights into programming
01:51 - all good programmers can look at a piece
01:53 - of code and use what they know to trace
01:56 - through it logically
01:57 - let's try with an example that's
01:59 - sometimes a little bit tricky to
02:01 - newcomers check out this bit of code
02:04 - in the first two lines you can see that
02:06 - we have created two new variables uh
02:08 - a and a b and assign them both initial
02:11 - values of two
02:13 - in the next two lines we've updated
02:15 - their values so that they each get the
02:17 - value of a plus b
02:19 - at first glance you might think that a
02:21 - and b are both going to end up the same
02:24 - but they won't the key is to recognize
02:26 - that the value of a is being updated on
02:28 - the line just before b is changed so
02:31 - what's being computed will change as
02:33 - well let's trace it out when a gets a
02:37 - plus b this will take the current values
02:39 - of a and b and add them together
02:41 - the result of the equation is stored in
02:43 - the value of a so as soon as this line
02:46 - of code is run the value of a has
02:47 - changed to 4.
02:50 - with the next line of code b gets a plus
02:52 - b the sum of a plus b is now 6.
02:56 - this new number gets stored in the value
02:57 - of b so the final outcome of the code
03:00 - looks like this
03:02 - variables are an extremely powerful tool
03:05 - in computer programming by using
03:06 - variables you can harness the power of
03:09 - your computer's memory to dynamically
03:11 - track important information while your
03:12 - program is running now let's get some
03:14 - practice
