00:05 - our daily lives are filled with
00:06 - decisions big and small
00:09 - even simple choices like what to wear
00:11 - usually are the result of complex
00:13 - considerations what's the weather going
00:15 - to be like what will you be doing today
00:17 - do you feel like making an impression or
00:20 - keeping it casual
00:21 - but the world around us is constantly
00:23 - changing so we want to adapt the choices
00:26 - we make to match the changing conditions
00:28 - what's true for humans is also true for
00:30 - computer programs we don't want our
00:32 - programs to always run in the same way
00:35 - they should respond to changing
00:36 - conditions
00:38 - in the last video we learned how to use
00:41 - boolean expressions to establish whether
00:43 - something is true or false
00:45 - we can now add something called a
00:47 - conditional statement to help guide the
00:49 - computer's decisions based on that
00:51 - information
00:52 - the simplest conditional statement is an
00:54 - if statement
00:56 - it says that if something is true the
00:59 - computer should run a specific block of
01:01 - code
01:02 - let's say that you want to create a
01:03 - program that displays whether or not you
01:05 - are old enough to see a pg-13 movie
01:08 - so the question we want the computer to
01:10 - evaluate is if age is greater than or
01:14 - equal to 13.
01:16 - the question or boolean expression goes
01:18 - next to the if
01:20 - the block of code we want to run only if
01:23 - the condition is true goes inside the if
01:25 - statement
01:27 - so in our example whenever the
01:28 - expression age greater than or equal to
01:30 - 13 is true the program will write to the
01:34 - screen that you are old enough to see a
01:35 - pg-13 movie
01:37 - of course some people will not be old
01:39 - enough
01:40 - in these kinds of situations we will
01:42 - want our programs to do something else
01:44 - when the condition is false
01:46 - in order to do this we will want to
01:48 - expand our if statements to include an
01:51 - else statement
01:52 - the commands contained in this else
01:54 - statement only run if the boolean
01:56 - condition in the if statement is false
02:00 - in app lab you can add an else statement
02:02 - by either dragging out the if else block
02:05 - or by clicking the plus symbol in the
02:07 - bottom right corner of the if block
02:18 - sometimes the decisions you will want
02:20 - your program to make have more than two
02:22 - possible outcomes
02:24 - let's continue our movie rating example
02:27 - where we want to check whether the
02:29 - highest rating you can go see alone is
02:31 - an r-rated movie a pg-13 movie or just a
02:35 - g rated movie
02:37 - to check between these three different
02:38 - cases we can add an else if statement
02:42 - an else if statement is another
02:44 - condition that a program checks only if
02:47 - the previous if statements were false
02:50 - so if age is greater than or equal to 17
02:55 - right that user can see an r-rated movie
02:57 - alone
02:58 - else if
02:59 - the age is greater than or equal to 13
03:03 - write that the user can see a pg-13
03:05 - movie alone
03:07 - else
03:08 - right that the user can see a g-rated
03:10 - movie alone
03:12 - the else condition becomes the default
03:14 - condition because when all the previous
03:16 - if and else if statements are false it
03:19 - will default to the else statement
03:22 - be careful as you construct longer
03:23 - sequences of elsif statements
03:26 - if you mix up the order you might not
03:28 - get the behavior you intended
03:31 - in our example
03:32 - imagine we had switched the code so that
03:34 - the first condition checked if the user
03:36 - was old enough to see pg-13 movies
03:39 - like this
03:41 - this would mean that everyone who is 13
03:44 - or older would be told they can only see
03:46 - pg-13 movies even the adults
03:50 - and with the next elsift line the
03:52 - computer would be looking for people 17
03:54 - or older in the remaining group
03:56 - this code misses the adults because they
03:59 - were true in that first condition
04:01 - this won't work
04:03 - the computer checks the conditions from
04:05 - top to bottom so it is important to
04:08 - enter the most specific condition first
04:18 - you
