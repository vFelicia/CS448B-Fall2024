00:00 - look at this problem it looks very
00:02 - familiar in fact you might feel like you
00:05 - can just go through and move forward and
00:07 - collect nectar wherever there's a flower
00:09 - and not collect it if there's not one
00:11 - the problem is for this pattern the code
00:14 - you would end up with would be way too
00:15 - long
00:17 - so
00:17 - we need to figure out a quicker way to
00:20 - go through and check every square and if
00:22 - there is a flower get nectar but just
00:25 - move along if there's no flower
00:28 - how have we done that before
