00:02 - Unplugged Activity | Internet
00:05 - (Amy Hirotaka - Code.org) 
This activity explains,
00:07 - in a easy-to-understand way, how the internet works.
00:10 - We explain all the terminology you'll need in simple terms,
00:14 - so that students can simulate transmitting messages, like an email.
00:17 - Students will transmit messages while pretending to be
00:20 - one of three transmission methods:
00:23 - wireless internet (WIFI), DSL or fiber-optic.
00:26 - The students who represent WIFI,
00:28 - will have to wear the message they're transmitting on their head,
00:31 - because WIFI is the most likely to drop some information.
00:34 - The students pretending to be DSL or cable
00:37 - will carry the message on the back to their hand
00:39 - where they're slightly less likely to drop information.
00:42 - And the students representing fiber-optic
00:45 - will get to carry them with both hands.
00:48 - This activity is a great way to understand
00:50 - something that many of us use every day.
