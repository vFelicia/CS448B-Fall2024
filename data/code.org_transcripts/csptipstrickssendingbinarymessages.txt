00:02 - in this lesson your students are going
00:04 - to work in pairs to build a physical
00:06 - device for sending messages back and
00:08 - forth
00:09 - these devices will communicate binary
00:12 - information or information that can be
00:14 - represented in two possible ways
00:16 - in order to successfully communicate
00:18 - with their partners students will need
00:20 - to develop three things
00:22 - first a question that has a binary
00:24 - response
00:25 - second a device for sending messages
00:28 - and third a system for communicating
00:31 - over that device so
00:33 - you're gonna have to come up with your
00:34 - question you're gonna have to come up
00:35 - with your device and you're gonna have
00:36 - to come up with your rules and you're
00:38 - gonna document all of those things
00:39 - you're gonna actually build your device
00:41 - because in a lot of cases you might not
00:43 - just want to use a slinky you might want
00:44 - to put stuff together and then we're
00:46 - going to send messages to one another
00:48 - while students are choosing their
00:49 - materials it's really really important
00:51 - that they think about the fact that
00:53 - they're going to have to deal with
00:54 - different situations in terms of
00:56 - physical setup so right now they'll be
00:58 - able to see one another but later on
01:00 - there will be obstacles so they need to
01:02 - be considerate of that fact while
01:04 - they're making this initial selection
01:06 - both partners who build the device have
01:08 - to agree on the rules for how to use it
01:09 - in order to send their messages yeah you
01:12 - want to test it sure let's do it
01:14 - this lesson explores the cs principal's
01:16 - big ideas of creativity and abstraction
01:19 - these physical devices will be built out
01:21 - of miscellaneous supplies like
01:22 - flashlights cups and string slinkies and
01:25 - whistles
01:26 - as students work on their device you
01:28 - should challenge them to handle
01:29 - different conditions for example if
01:32 - students build a device like this one
01:34 - that depends on both partners being able
01:36 - to see each other
01:37 - then it won't work if the two are
01:39 - separated by putting one of them around
01:41 - the corner and out of view
01:43 - as students test their devices under
01:45 - different conditions they'll need to
01:47 - update their rules and the physical
01:49 - system itself in order to deal with the
01:51 - new conditions some students might
01:53 - realize that their devices actually have
01:55 - more than two possible states which is
01:57 - why it becomes really important that
01:59 - they have clear instructions for using
02:00 - the device for example if a group uses
02:03 - cups in string to build a traditional
02:06 - telephone setup then there are way more
02:08 - than two possible conditions of the
02:09 - device
02:10 - one set of rules might have you tug the
02:12 - cord while your partner waits to feel
02:14 - for the tugs and another set of rules
02:16 - for the exact same device could instruct
02:19 - you to tap the cup or pluck the string
02:21 - while your partner listens for the taps
02:23 - or plucks
02:24 - the rules might not always be obvious so
02:27 - make sure your students are really clear
02:29 - about how they expect the devices to be
02:30 - used
02:32 - you should have written down with your
02:33 - partner what your question is and what
02:35 - your two possible responses are
02:38 - and then you should also write down the
02:40 - rules for using your device students
02:42 - should focus here on the fact that the
02:44 - same device can be used to answer any
02:46 - binary question
02:47 - the goal is to have not a purpose-built
02:50 - tool that's only useful for answering
02:52 - one thing but instead something that can
02:54 - abstract out and standardize different
02:57 - signals for answers a and b
02:59 - this way the meaning of answer a or the
03:01 - meaning of answer b could change but the
03:03 - device is still generally useful
03:05 - for a more complex system we can think
03:08 - about how to combine two possible states
03:10 - of our device in order to represent even
03:13 - more things if we go back to the
03:15 - flashlight example from before then our
03:17 - two states are the light on or the light
03:20 - off but we can represent way more than
03:22 - two things by combining sequences of on
03:24 - and off for devices that truly have two
03:27 - states like a flashlight it can be
03:28 - challenging to send a sequence of the
03:30 - same state over and over again
03:32 - for example if a student wants to send a
03:34 - sequence of five consecutive off states
03:37 - how does the recipient know when one
03:39 - ends in the next one starts
03:41 - this problem is foreshadowing of the
03:43 - binary number system and the binary
03:45 - representation of information
03:47 - the devices simulate a really basic
03:49 - version of the physical system that real
03:51 - electronic and digital gadgets use for
03:53 - communication every day we'll learn a
03:55 - lot more about how those work soon
