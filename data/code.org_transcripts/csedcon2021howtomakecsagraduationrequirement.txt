00:06 - hello good afternoon everybody
00:11 - testing
00:13 - check one two
02:17 - uh
02:34 - i don't think
02:49 - security
03:06 - if you just really want to use it
03:10 - there's an adapter
03:27 - hello everyone uh welcome uh good
03:31 - morning and thank you for being here um
03:34 - if you're here you're probably
03:35 - interested in how you can make computer
03:37 - science graduation requirement um and uh
03:40 - now i'd also like to welcome everyone
03:42 - who's joining us virtually thank you as
03:44 - well
03:45 - and without further ado
03:47 - please remember to check in if you are
03:50 - at a table
03:51 - you have your scanner there
03:53 - and i am going to turn it over to seth
03:56 - gerson we have a panel of great people
03:59 - here today to talk us through graduation
04:01 - requirements so without further ado
04:03 - welcoming seth gerson of the national
04:05 - governors association
04:07 - well thank you maggie and
04:10 - good afternoon good morning everyone
04:12 - depending on your geographic location
04:14 - like maggie said i'm seth gerson
04:17 - program director for k-12 education at
04:19 - the national governors association
04:24 - and it's great to be with all of you
04:25 - today i like the excitement from the
04:27 - start
04:28 - i'm just going to provide a bit of
04:30 - background on how governors approach
04:32 - computer science education and how
04:34 - governor hutchinson plans to engage
04:36 - governors on this issue as part of his
04:39 - chairs initiative over the next year or
04:41 - so
04:42 - first just a little bit about the
04:44 - national governors association our
04:45 - membership are there governors in all 50
04:47 - states and five territories and we
04:50 - support governors primarily by providing
04:52 - a bipartisan
04:54 - safe space
04:56 - a safe forum
04:58 - there we go a safe forum for governors
05:00 - to connect with each other to exchange
05:03 - ideas and share promising practices
05:05 - strategies they're using
05:06 - challenges they're facing it's an
05:08 - opportunity for them to share
05:10 - what's working and what's not in their
05:12 - states across party and state lines and
05:15 - there's a spirit of bipartisanship that
05:17 - infuses all of our work and that starts
05:19 - with our leadership which is always a
05:21 - current republican governor and a
05:23 - current democratic governor with our
05:25 - current chair being governor isa
05:26 - hutchinson of arkansas and fresh off his
05:29 - reelection this week our vice chair
05:32 - governor phil murphy of new jersey and
05:34 - as you can see on the slide we've been
05:36 - doing this for a long time we have a
05:38 - long tradition of doing so the national
05:40 - governors association began in 1908 back
05:44 - then teddy roosevelt himself a former
05:46 - governor of new york was president and
05:48 - he invited governors from across the
05:50 - country to washington dc to know to what
05:53 - we now know is one of his legacy issues
05:55 - on conservation president roosevelt knew
05:58 - that if he was going to move forward on
06:00 - this initiative he would need the
06:01 - support of governors well governors
06:03 - enjoyed meeting so much
06:05 - those two three days the sharing of best
06:07 - practices
06:08 - the knowledge that was being built
06:10 - across states they decided we should
06:12 - really have an organization that
06:13 - regularly brings us together on a
06:15 - bipartisan basis to discuss policy
06:17 - issues so more than 110 years later here
06:20 - we are the national governors
06:21 - association
06:22 - now every july a new nga chair and vice
06:25 - chair are named and each year the nga
06:28 - chair selects an initiative that can
06:30 - engage and convene a cross section of
06:33 - bipartisan governors from across the
06:34 - country recent nga chairs initiatives
06:37 - have focused on job training cyber
06:39 - security energy health care and
06:41 - infrastructure and so this year to the
06:43 - unlikely surprise of probably anyone in
06:45 - this room or online governor hutchinson
06:48 - chose to focus on k-12 computer science
06:50 - education as his chair is initiative
06:53 - over the next year an issue that i know
06:55 - anthony will go into deeper in the next
06:57 - few minutes but as you know has been a
06:59 - central focus of his two terms in office
07:02 - and that he ran on in both his election
07:04 - 2014 and his re-election in 2018. now
07:08 - governors tend to approach computer
07:10 - science education in three ways first
07:13 - with a focus on providing a pathway to
07:15 - critical computing occupations including
07:17 - in the areas of cyber security ai
07:20 - robotics and data science a focus on
07:22 - computer science education as a key to
07:24 - economic growth and competitiveness
07:27 - innovation national security and a
07:29 - strong workforce
07:31 - second governors also approached the
07:32 - issue around the importance of computer
07:34 - science education as a foundational set
07:37 - of skills that all students need to
07:39 - succeed in today's workforce things like
07:42 - creativity
07:43 - solving critical thinking data analysis
07:46 - troubleshooting
07:48 - third and hottie touched on this
07:51 - yesterday in the opening plenary
07:53 - we've seen the pandemic bring new
07:55 - attention to this issue governors have
07:56 - worked throughout the pandemic to close
07:58 - the digital divide expand broadband and
08:01 - devices internet access and connectivity
08:04 - for millions of students
08:05 - teachers and families
08:07 - ninety percent and again hottie pointed
08:09 - this out yet ninety percent of middle
08:10 - and high school students now have
08:12 - devices up from 66 pre pandemic and just
08:16 - last month
08:18 - the news magazine axios was out with a
08:20 - survey that showed that 50 percent of
08:22 - teachers are more confident using
08:24 - technology to engage students than
08:26 - before the pandemic as the washington
08:28 - post put it teachers are finding
08:30 - pandemic tech has changed their jobs
08:32 - forever so that's a significant change
08:34 - and it provides a springboard for
08:36 - expanding student access to computer
08:38 - science education and laying a strong
08:41 - foundation for increasing students
08:43 - overall digital illiteracy
08:46 - in terms of the specifics of the
08:47 - timeline
08:49 - for the chairs initiative since july
08:51 - when governor hutchinson became chair
08:53 - and announced the focus of his
08:55 - initiative nga has held a roundtable
08:57 - with industry leaders in july a
08:59 - convening of bipartisan governors in
09:01 - denver in august the launch of a new
09:03 - website and resource bank for the
09:05 - initiative on the nga website nga.org
09:08 - backslash computer science it's on the
09:10 - slide there as well in september and a
09:12 - public launch event of the initiative at
09:14 - the national press club in washington
09:16 - d.c in october
09:18 - from here we plan to engage governors
09:20 - throughout winter and spring 2022 with a
09:23 - dedicated session on computer science
09:25 - education at our annual winter meeting
09:27 - in january 2022 that typically draws
09:30 - between 40 and 45 governors and then
09:33 - we'll have regional convenings of
09:34 - governors and their staff in bentonville
09:36 - arkansas in march 2022 and boston
09:39 - massachusetts in may 2022 at the winner
09:42 - meeting we plan to introduce a draft
09:45 - compact or consensus statement for
09:47 - governors to sign on to committing to
09:49 - expanding access for computerized
09:51 - science education in their states which
09:53 - will then be unveiled at the summer
09:54 - meeting using the momentum of the
09:56 - regional convenings to secure signatures
09:59 - and drive governor interest and
10:00 - engagement
10:02 - and lastly
10:04 - there are five goals
10:06 - of the initiative all of which are on
10:08 - the nga site and this slide number one
10:11 - to increase the number of high schools
10:13 - offering computer science classes number
10:16 - two to increase the number of governors
10:18 - in the govs for cs coalition right now
10:20 - there's 14 governors so upping that
10:23 - number
10:23 - to increase the amount of state funding
10:25 - for computer science education is number
10:27 - three upping from the 65 million dollars
10:30 - dedicated last year number four to
10:33 - increase the number of states requiring
10:34 - at least one computer science education
10:37 - credit for high school graduation
10:39 - main topic of this this session and to
10:42 - increase the diversity number five of
10:44 - students participating in computer
10:45 - science education to address the
10:47 - inequities and gaps in access for girls
10:50 - students of color and students with
10:51 - disabilities among a number of other
10:53 - groups so luckily we have two states
10:56 - with us today that have made progress
10:58 - and are leaders in all of these areas so
11:00 - i'm going to end there and pass it back
11:01 - to maggie anthony and angel to
11:03 - illustrate the strategies that a state
11:05 - can use to reach these goals thank you
11:08 - thank you seth uh and speaking of
11:10 - arkansas it's a perfect time to turn it
11:12 - over to anthony owen of the arkansas
11:14 - department of education
11:16 - who will talk a little bit more about
11:17 - their programs okay thank you maggie and
11:19 - thanks seth and
11:21 - i think i speak on behalf of i think i
11:23 - can speak on behalf of the governor's
11:25 - office in this and just say that we
11:26 - appreciate the amplification that nga
11:29 - has given to arkansas initiative and
11:32 - governor hutchinson's passion in this
11:34 - space uh using y'all's platform so thank
11:36 - you all for doing that
11:38 - so when we were asked to kind of plan
11:40 - for this session
11:42 - we were asked to think about what
11:44 - information information we would like to
11:46 - share
11:47 - and
11:49 - you know in the over the past
11:50 - day and a half we've heard from even
11:52 - hotty year stay talking about the
11:54 - graduation requirement and some of the
11:57 - apprehension around that requirement
12:00 - and i think what states need to take
12:02 - away from before they look at doing this
12:04 - is that they really have to think
12:06 - strategically about this this is not
12:08 - something that if your state
12:10 - is just now getting into the cs
12:12 - education space as an emphasis that you
12:15 - all should really be focused on in my
12:16 - opinion uh i think that's something that
12:19 - you can have as an end goal
12:21 - but it's or a goal at some point down
12:24 - the road but you have to set up the
12:25 - foundation you have to set up that that
12:28 - structure in place
12:29 - arkansas you know we've been leading the
12:32 - nation since 2015 pretty much in this
12:34 - space uh because of the work that we've
12:36 - been doing the meaningful and fast-paced
12:39 - work
12:41 - and it took us six years to look at
12:43 - implemented trying to implement a
12:45 - graduation requirement even while we
12:46 - were leading
12:48 - but during those six years we were
12:50 - strategically looking at things like our
12:53 - teachers how many teachers do you have
12:55 - out there able to teach these courses
12:58 - there's no reason trying to implement a
12:59 - graduation mandate if you don't have
13:01 - those those individuals in place with
13:03 - the skills that they need to reach the
13:04 - students and the communities
13:06 - the training
13:08 - it's not just getting teachers certified
13:10 - because just because someone is
13:12 - certified in a particular subject area
13:14 - doesn't mean that they're ready to teach
13:16 - to the level that our students need and
13:18 - our communities need in our industry
13:19 - need
13:20 - the standards standards arkansas we've
13:23 - been through two full revisions of our
13:25 - computer science standards in the six
13:27 - years of this initiative we had a 20
13:30 - we did our first revision in 2017 we
13:32 - finished our our second revision 2020
13:34 - and our new courses came online this
13:36 - fall so we've really given some thought
13:39 - to that with industry partners within
13:41 - the room
13:42 - we've been very blessed in arkansas to
13:44 - have
13:45 - adequate funding
13:47 - and probably more than adequate funding
13:49 - some people would say but
13:51 - i think that the funding has went to
13:53 - good use which is uh you know evident in
13:55 - our programs
13:56 - but the first biennium we were the
13:59 - governor was gracious enough to put 5
14:01 - million of his rainy day funding funding
14:04 - into the first biennium we worked to get
14:07 - legislation in place that put 2.5 for
14:10 - the next you know each year for the next
14:12 - four years and then most recently
14:14 - starting with this fiscal year that
14:16 - budget has been up through our
14:18 - legislative appropriation as a line item
14:20 - to 3.5 million per year so we continue
14:24 - we continue to see funding support
14:26 - my cs specialist team i don't see any of
14:29 - them in here which i was going to you
14:30 - know recognize them
14:32 - but maybe they've ran away so uh
14:36 - but anyway they are here they have on
14:37 - matching shirts to me we have uh about
14:39 - half our team here we have 10 statewide
14:42 - computer science specialists that are
14:43 - part of my team
14:45 - that we have provided training to over
14:47 - half
14:48 - of our certified teachers in arkansas so
14:51 - thousands of hours of training which has
14:54 - grown
14:55 - not only our high school certified
14:56 - teachers from under 50 to right around
14:59 - 600 currently
15:01 - but we have other trainings that are
15:03 - advanced level we have k-8 level
15:05 - trainings including our lead teacher
15:07 - we've heard a lot about integrating
15:09 - within that k-8 environment well how are
15:11 - you training those teachers it may not
15:13 - be that they're they need full
15:15 - certification but they definitely need
15:16 - some support
15:18 - and then i would be remiss if i didn't
15:20 - again mention governor hutchinson's
15:22 - support
15:23 - you know he has went out and visited uh
15:26 - over 80 schools talking about
15:28 - why computer science is important
15:31 - you know he has made personal phone
15:33 - calls to superintendents that he felt
15:34 - like could be doing a better job in
15:36 - their schools in these in these states
15:39 - so
15:39 - that leadership has
15:41 - has really played a crucial part
15:44 - and and basically you know as as the
15:46 - slide says if states try to implement
15:48 - this before that strong foundation is
15:49 - established
15:51 - what we're seeing
15:52 - that states that try to move too fast
15:55 - that their implementation is going to
15:58 - fail
15:59 - or the outcome goals will have to be
16:00 - adjusted to the point that it's really
16:03 - watered down a watered-down requirement
16:06 - and you know in arkansas we feel that
16:08 - our requirement is
16:10 - um you know high level
16:12 - uh we do allow apcsa and csp and then we
16:15 - have over 50 other courses that will
16:17 - meet this graduation requirement that
16:19 - we've developed uh internally i will
16:22 - tell you apcsp
16:24 - a lot of people that is a good course i
16:26 - agree with that but if you look at the
16:28 - rigor of apcsp compared to our year one
16:31 - courses at high school in arkansas
16:34 - apcsp is actually lower rigor than
16:36 - anything that we wrote at a high school
16:38 - level so it is our lowest rigor course
16:41 - that meets this graduation requirement
16:44 - so
16:46 - you know not only must the state have
16:48 - that strong foundation
16:50 - but you have to have the public support
16:52 - behind it and that's where governor
16:54 - hutchinson's uh focus on this has been
16:57 - so crucial we've put ads in theaters uh
17:01 - going directly to parents a lot of seas
17:04 - rely on trying to send information to
17:06 - schools and then having the schools
17:07 - disseminate that information to their
17:09 - communities we do that also but we're
17:11 - also going directly to parents and
17:13 - students talking about the importance of
17:15 - this and the reason that that it is good
17:18 - for smaller communities especially and
17:21 - families uh building that positivity
17:23 - around it uh through maybe it's bonuses
17:26 - for teachers
17:27 - uh different competitions that we you
17:30 - know elevate in in stature
17:32 - awards for students you know we are
17:34 - state coding competition for high school
17:37 - our our winning team gets two thousand
17:39 - dollars each team member and uh ten
17:42 - thousand dollars to go back to their
17:43 - school's cs program and we give other
17:45 - awards for different levels and then we
17:46 - also have middle school contests and
17:48 - then strategic partnerships at those
17:50 - middle and lower grade levels like our
17:52 - partnership with learning blade which
17:54 - really helps us
17:57 - drive awareness of stem
17:59 - stem opportunities for students
18:02 - we might get into this a little bit
18:03 - later but you know we see this as an
18:06 - economic driver for arkansas
18:08 - it and it needs to be approached that
18:10 - way
18:13 - but it can't just be another another
18:15 - academic requirement that's placed on
18:17 - schools and students there has to be a
18:19 - reason behind it and the reason is that
18:22 - that our students are going to need
18:24 - these skills to get into those jobs in
18:26 - the fourth technological revolution or
18:28 - industrial revolution
18:31 - if you have this foundation in place if
18:34 - you have these key components in place
18:36 - then the supporting legislation
18:38 - for the mandate can come
18:41 - we wanted to do it through legislation
18:43 - the representative body we could have
18:45 - done it through regulation
18:47 - but we wanted to go to our legislature
18:49 - because if we can't convince our
18:51 - legislature our legislators
18:54 - that this is good as representatives of
18:56 - our communities and we did it via
18:58 - regulatory body
19:00 - then there's going to be more pushback
19:02 - because it is not reflective of the
19:03 - community and what their desires are
19:06 - so i've shared some links on this slide
19:08 - to our strategic plan if you're going to
19:10 - think strategically i invite you to go
19:12 - out and look at our plan there are
19:13 - actually a couple of states i think took
19:15 - our strategic plan search for arkansas
19:17 - and plugged their state name in it
19:19 - that's fine we're okay with that
19:22 - and then really this work couldn't have
19:25 - driven or been driven to work has been
19:28 - without the work of our two task force
19:30 - uh act 187 which set up our mandate that
19:33 - every high school had to offer a cs
19:34 - course back in 2015 also established our
19:37 - first task force on this
19:38 - and a lot of their recommendations are
19:41 - what have driven our strategic planning
19:43 - over the past four years
19:45 - in 2020 we brought in a second task
19:47 - force a governor's level task force on
19:49 - this
19:49 - and they not only reviewed what we had
19:53 - done from the previous task force
19:54 - recommendations
19:56 - but then made new recommendations for
19:58 - moving forward and we looked at we
20:00 - looked at those
20:01 - recommendations for our standards
20:03 - revision
20:04 - or our legislation and really how my
20:07 - office moves forward as we push this
20:09 - initiative
20:11 - so i'm going to leave leave you with two
20:13 - quotes before i hand it back to maggie
20:16 - here and angel
20:17 - jack welch is kind of a hero of mine
20:20 - just his business based mindset and
20:23 - this quote has always kind of spoken to
20:25 - me in our initiative when launching
20:26 - something new you have to go for it
20:28 - playing not to lose can never be an
20:30 - option and that fits right in with my
20:32 - team's motto which is
20:34 - no excuses only results and that's what
20:37 - we try to press amongst all our schools
20:39 - and then this one i always kind of find
20:41 - funny and remind my team of it if plan a
20:44 - doesn't work remember the alphabet has
20:46 - 25 more letters so maggie
20:50 - thank you so much anthony um and last
20:52 - but certainly not least angel malone
20:54 - here from the south carolina department
20:56 - of education angel
20:58 - so good morning good afternoon to
21:00 - everyone here in the audience and online
21:03 - uh thank you for just coming to hear
21:06 - about what has been done thus far
21:08 - excited about the work with anthony
21:11 - with arkansas and seth with nga
21:13 - and i'm just here to kind of close it
21:15 - out to show you what south carolina has
21:17 - done i am the career and technical
21:19 - education director for the state
21:21 - department of education and i'm excited
21:23 - to share with you what south carolina
21:25 - has done to make that happen
21:27 - um we started out with looking at our
21:30 - vision for career and technical
21:32 - education by ensuring that we prepare
21:33 - students for workforce
21:36 - and
21:37 - as anthony has shared there has to be
21:39 - that north star or that y for what
21:41 - you're doing so that you can always
21:43 - point towards that so for us we want to
21:46 - ensure that students are empowered to
21:48 - understand k through 12 in k-12 computer
21:51 - science and also computational thinking
21:54 - and we think that with that our mission
21:56 - is that cs is key that we kindle that
22:00 - fire or or that awareness for computer
22:03 - science that we ensure that we look
22:04 - through the lens of equity that we are
22:06 - touching all populations all
22:08 - demographics across our state because it
22:12 - is vast and that it requires the input
22:15 - of everyone of you of being a part of
22:17 - that and being in partnership and that
22:20 - is because from the time that you wake
22:22 - up until the time that you go to sleep
22:25 - you are computing you are engaging with
22:28 - computer science whether you want to or
22:30 - not and we had a joke in our last
22:32 - session i said my sister asked me why
22:35 - don't i have an
22:37 - apple watch and i said because i don't
22:38 - want to be surveilled and she said that
22:40 - is so hypocritical cool because you have
22:42 - an iphone and you interact with
22:44 - everything and so i say that because we
22:48 - need to ensure that we prepare students
22:50 - not only as consumers but also creators
22:52 - and architects of what
22:55 - engaging with computer science has to
22:56 - offer for our world globally and that
22:58 - they are competitively advantaged and so
23:01 - we did that by
23:03 - implementing computer science through
23:05 - various levers and that is number one to
23:08 - create that awareness so students
23:10 - parents all shareholders are are
23:14 - knowledgeable of of the aspects of
23:16 - computer science as well as the benefits
23:18 - we also wanted to ensure that we had
23:19 - strategic partnerships with various
23:22 - wrap-around services understanding that
23:24 - it cannot happen within that k-12 realm
23:27 - alone that it has to happen outside of
23:30 - school and also providing those on-ramps
23:33 - into post-secondary opportunities and
23:36 - for people who are engaged in getting
23:38 - back into the workforce and need
23:39 - additional education we also wanted to
23:42 - ensure
23:43 - that we built the infrastructure
23:45 - appropriately for teachers to build
23:47 - their capacity and to have credentialing
23:50 - opportunities and to make that as i
23:53 - heard someone say yesterday as an
23:55 - interstate not just as a road map or a
23:57 - highway but to ensure there were many
23:59 - opportunities for teachers to be able to
24:02 - get the support that they need we're
24:04 - excited about that we were able to
24:07 - provide credentialing opportunities
24:08 - through work based learning so those
24:10 - experts in the field that are coming
24:12 - from industry we have that opportunity
24:14 - for them to be a part of it and to train
24:16 - our students as well as our teachers who
24:18 - are already certified providing
24:20 - opportunities for them to have full
24:22 - computer science certification through
24:24 - testing or by also a microcredentialing
24:27 - program that we're piloting this year to
24:30 - ensure that there are those
24:31 - opportunities in all areas across our
24:34 - state especially those very very rural
24:36 - ones that we can have a depth of
24:38 - knowledge in computer science and it's
24:41 - just not those introductory courses but
24:43 - those advanced courses that will give
24:45 - our students the greatest competitive
24:46 - advantage and so we wanted to also make
24:49 - sure that there was legislative backing
24:51 - and funding so as anthony said not just
24:53 - the regulatory piece where we're putting
24:55 - that
24:55 - there for for schools to follow by
24:58 - having that computer science graduation
25:00 - credit of which we think it's very
25:01 - important and i'll share that with you
25:03 - as well but also have the legislative
25:06 - backing and funding of the importance of
25:08 - it and how we did that was by ensuring
25:11 - that we looked at workforce to do that
25:15 - that's what was important for us so and
25:17 - i'm sorry i'm navigating between this
25:19 - screen and that screen
25:21 - so we started out by ensuring that there
25:24 - was a certification process that we
25:26 - identified that this is something of
25:27 - importance and that teachers had a way
25:29 - to quantify their knowledge by having a
25:31 - certification we then implemented the k
25:34 - through 8 computer science standards and
25:36 - then followed behind with that the 9
25:38 - through 12 computer science standards we
25:40 - have at linkedin here our strategic plan
25:43 - so you can kind of see what our mindset
25:45 - was and i think that is very important
25:48 - as you look at broadening the
25:49 - participation and implementing a high
25:52 - school graduation credit i will say that
25:55 - this is one of the ways it's hardy said
25:58 - they they haven't they're in the wait
26:00 - and see mode to see if this kind of
26:02 - works to have that grad credit but
26:04 - here's what i know
26:06 - computer science is the equalizer for
26:09 - people from all
26:10 - socioeconomic backgrounds and i
26:13 - understand that with a specific amount
26:16 - of skill set that a student who is um in
26:20 - in a place of poverty can literally
26:23 - change the trajectory of their family
26:26 - not just themselves but the generation
26:29 - that follows them by being a part of
26:31 - computer science gaining that skill set
26:33 - and being able to go on a job get paid
26:36 - while they continue learning
26:38 - and so it's very important that we have
26:40 - that as a requirement because number one
26:42 - students have to engage
26:44 - with
26:45 - computer science and computational
26:47 - thinking from the time they get up you
26:50 - know that child that's four years old
26:51 - knows how to say alexa
26:53 - turn on peppa pig right they know how to
26:57 - do that right and so we want to ensure
26:59 - that not only can they engage and be the
27:01 - consumer but they are also the creators
27:03 - and the architects of it and can change
27:05 - it globally and be competitive
27:08 - so the bill that we
27:10 - got passed thankfully last year was age
27:12 - 3612 and one of the things that i am so
27:16 - grateful that it allows us to do is to
27:18 - employ a cs supervisor dominique sanders
27:20 - who is in the room um and is also a cs
27:23 - equity fellow we also uh have the
27:27 - creation of a statewide plan and i
27:29 - wanted to share this that this is
27:30 - implemented now for us to create a
27:32 - statewide plan i wanted to be very
27:34 - transparent to say we didn't have a plan
27:36 - when we started
27:37 - but we now rank up there with arkansas
27:41 - so far as brought in participation and i
27:43 - say that because you need to start
27:46 - wherever you are
27:47 - look at what the emphasis is for your
27:50 - state look at what your governor is
27:52 - focusing on and align with those things
27:54 - and start wherever you can we also are
27:58 - hiring four regional coaches for
28:00 - computer science so if you know of any
28:02 - send them our way so we can get the best
28:04 - out there for implementation across the
28:07 - board for all areas and then designing
28:10 - career pathways as well as other
28:12 - professional development opportunities
28:14 - i'm grateful for the partnership that we
28:16 - have with csta we're able to
28:19 - work with our teachers to provide
28:21 - training last year we provided training
28:24 - for over 200 teachers this year it was
28:26 - over 330 teachers so we're able to grow
28:29 - that by leaps and bounds and get
28:31 - teachers to have endorsements as well as
28:34 - opportunities just to increase their
28:35 - knowledge about computer science and
28:37 - share that with students
28:39 - and so if i could give you any
28:41 - implementation advice it would be first
28:43 - of all conduct a needs assessment
28:46 - and look at your labor market to demand
28:48 - so i know that there's that issue of oh
28:50 - goodness we don't want to focus so much
28:52 - on the workforce but i think you have to
28:54 - have a why and we want all of our
28:56 - students to not only be great citizens
28:58 - but we want them to be responsible
29:00 - enough to be able to
29:01 - take care of themselves and their family
29:04 - this is the way that we do that to
29:05 - increase that access and then create
29:08 - awareness with all of the shareholders
29:10 - looking at the various vantage points
29:12 - and speaking to them from those
29:14 - particular aspects
29:16 - what i thought was amazing yesterday was
29:18 - the
29:19 - the algorithm
29:21 - video for younger students to show them
29:24 - how what you pick online
29:26 - everyone is cataloging your interest and
29:29 - creating those choices that you can look
29:30 - at so being able to share those parts of
29:33 - computer science and engaging with
29:35 - students that way and then
29:37 - building and developing that strategic
29:39 - plan as well as the infrastructure to
29:41 - make it happen there has to be ease of
29:43 - access with doing that with the user in
29:46 - mind so i will remind you of this we
29:49 - have made many
29:51 - uh
29:52 - steps along the way had to start over
29:54 - turn back around and all these different
29:56 - things
29:57 - just go for it uh author is angel malone
30:01 - with the understanding that it is
30:03 - there's not a perfect plan it's just you
30:06 - need to start where you are
30:08 - align yourself and continue to move
30:10 - don't stop
30:11 - thanks
30:13 - thank you so much angel that was
30:14 - fantastic let's give it up for our panel
30:19 - um
30:20 - so angel anthony um you both have had
30:24 - really good systems in place you have a
30:25 - really good foundation computer science
30:27 - is clearly important in your states uh
30:30 - before you actually went for this
30:31 - graduation requirement so what kind of
30:34 - pushback did you receive
30:35 - who who was pushing back against making
30:38 - graduation requirement was anybody
30:41 - oh goodness well so
30:45 - everyone who
30:46 - thinks that especially during the
30:48 - pandemic we are not doing as well in
30:51 - english and math right so this must be
30:53 - the emphasis
30:55 - and so we did have pushback there so far
30:57 - as what what does core instruction look
30:59 - like what are we taking away from
31:01 - students and i don't think that it is
31:04 - about taking away from them it's about
31:06 - sharing with your shareholders
31:08 - the both and the necessity of
31:10 - integrating computer science into
31:12 - everything and i'm so excited about the
31:14 - hour of code this year where cs is
31:15 - everywhere so we can show that it's in
31:17 - everything
31:19 - and that regardless of whether we want
31:21 - it to be or not it's going to be a part
31:23 - of our life and daily routine routine
31:26 - and to really share with workforce
31:28 - demand the workforce demand that we have
31:29 - in our state and also having residents
31:33 - to understand that we not only want you
31:34 - to be the consumer we want you to be the
31:36 - creators and the art architects so not
31:39 - only are you defining your journey but
31:41 - you are also becoming globally
31:42 - competitive to to orchestrate what's
31:45 - going to be used nationally
31:49 - so and you know i kind of want to
31:51 - piggyback on a little bit of that you
31:53 - know the yesterday we we heard the
31:55 - comments about that some and especially
31:58 - in the international panel and i greatly
31:59 - appreciate the perspective that they
32:01 - they brought but you know we heard that
32:03 - there were countries that were
32:05 - worried about these instruction in the
32:07 - core areas not being where they should
32:09 - be and they needed to correct that
32:10 - before they started focusing on
32:11 - something like cs
32:14 - my
32:14 - my team and i were talking about that
32:16 - last night as we were sitting around in
32:17 - the reception or after the reception and
32:20 - um you know i made the statement of what
32:22 - are they going to do differently okay
32:25 - if they haven't been getting the core
32:26 - instruction correct for the past
32:28 - how many ever decades what are they
32:31 - changing and that's really where cs and
32:33 - computing comes in
32:35 - is that that gives our students
32:38 - a relevant reason to learn many of those
32:41 - concepts we know that computational
32:43 - thinking is a mathematic skill we know
32:45 - that problem solving is a mathematics
32:47 - skill
32:48 - we know that all the pieces of a well
32:51 - thought out
32:52 - set of standards for a cs course are
32:54 - going to build upon those skills needed
32:56 - for mathematics sciences
32:58 - and and even to a certain extent the the
33:01 - english language arts and the ability to
33:03 - communicate uh effectively
33:05 - so
33:06 - we in education we talk all the time
33:08 - about making education relevant
33:11 - and that it means something to our
33:12 - students but then when we talk about
33:14 - just focusing on these areas without the
33:17 - application or the reason for it we're
33:19 - stepping backwards now back to maggie's
33:22 - question just briefly she asked about
33:24 - some pushback that we
33:26 - received and i mean you're going to get
33:28 - it
33:29 - you know as i said this morning when we
33:31 - were kind of discussing some of this
33:33 - stuff i said in education
33:36 - any change is always going to receive
33:38 - some sort of pushback from somebody
33:40 - because of those two words that i hate
33:43 - which are we've always
33:45 - okay
33:46 - don't say weave always to me because
33:48 - you're about to get unloaded
33:50 - on okay so um i don't like those words
33:55 - um those those should be curse words and
33:57 - education
33:58 - um so but anyway of course we had
34:00 - pushback we also had some pushback from
34:03 - a legislator legislators as we were
34:05 - trying to work this through the process
34:08 - and it wasn't negative but i had one
34:10 - legislator in in particular that
34:13 - that during the committee won the
34:15 - committee meetings brought up well why
34:17 - computer science why should we mandate
34:19 - computer science why should it not be
34:21 - construction
34:22 - why should it not be welding
34:24 - and he named off about three different
34:26 - things well i was prepared for this so
34:29 - um
34:30 - i in fact that just that morning i'd
34:33 - found a
34:34 - notice or a press alert of a company
34:37 - that was investing 40 million dollars
34:39 - in 3d printing of houses
34:42 - and the i don't remember the exact
34:45 - statistics but i had them in front of me
34:46 - at that time i want to say like the
34:48 - something like the reduction in
34:50 - construction costs for an average house
34:52 - was like 60 percent of what it normally
34:54 - was for a house but i know the reduction
34:57 - in waste was over 95 percent
35:00 - by 3d printing these houses so whenever
35:03 - that legislator said what about
35:04 - construction well guess what
35:06 - construction of the future is computer
35:09 - science welding of the future is
35:11 - computer science if you don't believe me
35:12 - go look at some of those cnc robots that
35:14 - are welding we have to have those
35:17 - those are the industrial robots that are
35:20 - welding we have to have
35:22 - the these skills mixed together try to
35:25 - be an auto mechanic today and not
35:27 - understand some computer science so if
35:30 - we want to
35:32 - bring up a generation of students that
35:34 - are ready for
35:35 - this fourth industrial revolution there
35:38 - has to be a relevant set or baseline set
35:41 - skills of computer science and computing
35:45 - so seth
35:47 - division in politics is nothing new
35:51 - even though it's kind of become more
35:52 - prevalent in the last few years
35:55 - with 55 different governors different
35:57 - ideas different personalities different
35:59 - parties uh why do we expect computer
36:01 - science to
36:02 - be something they should all get behind
36:05 - well thanks maggie it's a great question
36:07 - and
36:08 - um i think you know the first place to
36:10 - start is just to say that this has
36:12 - historically been a bipartisan issue you
36:15 - know governors from both parties have
36:18 - traditionally gotten behind computer
36:20 - science education and we don't see that
36:22 - that changing just seeing recent efforts
36:24 - all governors may come at it from
36:26 - different levels
36:28 - of how they want to move forward this
36:29 - this work but at the end of the day
36:31 - they're all focused on building a strong
36:33 - competitive workforce in their states
36:35 - and this is one of those issues of how
36:37 - do you create the pathways for that that
36:39 - strong workforce
36:40 - um and i think you know something that
36:42 - both angel and anthony brought up and
36:45 - and illustrated are the the levers that
36:47 - governors use in this area right in all
36:50 - of education but particularly this area
36:52 - they're using the bully pulpit they're
36:54 - using their convening powers they're
36:55 - using their agenda setting powers
36:58 - to raise public awareness
37:02 - to
37:02 - you know really
37:04 - sort of drive some of these task forces
37:06 - and mechanisms for bringing stakeholders
37:08 - around the table to move the the work
37:10 - forward
37:11 - you know just pointing to a few examples
37:14 - recent examples governor ivy and alabama
37:16 - for instance uh created a couple of
37:19 - different task forces one focused on
37:20 - stem and one interrelated on computer
37:22 - science education to bring again
37:24 - students and educators and parents and
37:26 - families um and k-12 and higher
37:29 - education
37:30 - to the table to set out a vision for
37:33 - what this work could be she then had you
37:35 - know annual
37:36 - conferences that brought together some
37:38 - of these stakeholders um and having and
37:40 - something anthony mentioned as well some
37:42 - of these coding competitions to draw
37:44 - students interests and
37:47 - bring public awareness to what are we
37:48 - talking about when we're talking about
37:50 - computer science education making it
37:52 - more tangible for the public and parents
37:54 - and families in new jersey governor
37:57 - murphy facilitated partnerships with
37:59 - three universities to create computer
38:01 - science learning hubs throughout the
38:03 - state and again this focus on not only
38:05 - increasing student access to computer
38:07 - science education but something we've
38:08 - heard throughout this conference the
38:10 - importance of also having that
38:11 - professional learning for teachers to be
38:13 - able to teach at the same time
38:15 - the the the content that's so so
38:17 - critical for this in georgia governor
38:20 - kemp announced a partnership earlier
38:22 - this year between high schools career
38:24 - and technical education programs and
38:25 - industry leaders again focused on that
38:27 - computing occupations
38:30 - pathway that's so so critical for
38:33 - building a strong workforce in their
38:34 - states and i want to go back to
38:36 - something you know and just re-emphasize
38:38 - that it's
38:40 - this new opportunity right now this
38:42 - inflection point as hottie called it um
38:45 - that governors are giving another look
38:48 - at where they can expand computer
38:50 - science education where they can
38:51 - increase students digital literacy
38:53 - there's just been so much
38:55 - investment in the device's connectivity
38:57 - access broadband over this time that its
39:00 - governor is looking at not only you know
39:02 - how to harness that but how to make sure
39:04 - that that students and teachers and
39:06 - families just really um
39:09 - make sure that they're they're using it
39:11 - in a way that's effectively
39:13 - and that really creates the ripple
39:15 - effect
39:16 - for building a competitive workforce in
39:17 - their states
39:19 - so i want to go off that point you
39:21 - mentioned workforce a lot and it's been
39:23 - brought up a few times today
39:24 - [Music]
39:26 - is there too much of a focus on work and
39:28 - the workforce when it comes to education
39:30 - especially in young grades
39:37 - well i guess i'll start and then sure
39:40 - move forward but i think too many times
39:42 - in education and policy overall we we
39:44 - look at some of the sort of false uh
39:47 - silos or false dichotomies and you know
39:49 - that it doesn't need to be sort of one
39:51 - or the other but it can be be both and
39:54 - certainly as i was saying you know
39:55 - governors are focused first and foremost
39:57 - on big building that strong competitive
39:59 - workforce in their states um and
40:03 - policy certainly works best when there's
40:05 - an alignment a strong alignment between
40:08 - what workforce needs are and the
40:10 - pathways that education is providing for
40:12 - that in a state but governors also
40:15 - understand that you know to keep
40:16 - students engaged throughout their
40:18 - schooling experience they must harness
40:20 - student interests right this goes back
40:22 - to ted sizer's you know famous comment
40:25 - around you know creating places for
40:26 - learning but also places for joy and so
40:28 - if you really you know provide students
40:31 - with those experiences and harness their
40:33 - interests and then always including
40:35 - parents and families communities at that
40:37 - center so that they're involved and
40:38 - engaged in their child's experience
40:40 - that's what will drive them towards the
40:42 - pathway that we're talking about for
40:44 - workforce so it's education and
40:45 - workforce they're not separated they're
40:47 - not siloed and
40:49 - you know harnessing that interest then
40:51 - also keeping your
40:52 - your guide as angel said on the north
40:54 - star of workforce gives you the why and
40:57 - i think it's also you know worth noting
41:00 - going back a little historically we get
41:02 - the question all the time where's the
41:03 - education governors of today people hark
41:05 - back to those 80s and 90s times around
41:08 - governor hunt of north carolina or
41:10 - governor riley of south carolina
41:12 - governor kaine of new jersey
41:14 - governor clinton of arkansas
41:16 - and
41:18 - the the truth is right now in short all
41:20 - governors are education governors um
41:22 - back then it was sort of more of a rare
41:25 - instance for governors to talk about
41:26 - education issues so it was notable
41:29 - but now all governors are focused on
41:31 - education they may come at it more from
41:33 - a workforce side they may come at it
41:35 - more from an education side or more
41:37 - likely both
41:38 - but all governors are talking about
41:40 - education these days and it's how they
41:43 - they talk about it
41:46 - so i'm just going to say ditto what seth
41:48 - said um it is that both end and i know
41:51 - that
41:53 - there's that challenge of individuals
41:55 - who say we focus too much on workforce
41:57 - and what they need in developing that
42:00 - pipeline we need to make sure that
42:02 - students are balanced but
42:04 - i think that we have to
42:06 - normalize that computational thinking is
42:11 - natural and it is something you do from
42:13 - birth
42:14 - until the time you leave and because of
42:17 - that we have to ensure that we are
42:19 - allowing students to engage and
42:21 - understand what they are engaging with
42:24 - so that they can understand that it is
42:25 - the cookies that are tracked that
42:27 - determine their choices and all of those
42:29 - different things but then also empower
42:32 - them to think entrepreneurially as well
42:34 - as
42:35 - um you know being able to go into the
42:38 - workforce in a competitive way so far as
42:41 - becoming again those architect or those
42:44 - the architect are the creators of this
42:46 - information and so it is that both end
42:48 - of creating that balance for them and
42:50 - making them well-rounded citizens but it
42:53 - all it is also about that north star of
42:56 - how do we
42:57 - fulfill workforce demand in things such
43:00 - as global logistics right now with your
43:02 - amazon packages not coming to your house
43:04 - on time or getting the stuff that you
43:06 - need for christmas and so it's those
43:08 - practical things that we have to be
43:10 - concerned about and how do we become
43:13 - globally competitive and it's through
43:15 - the these skill sets that students will
43:18 - be able to do that and navigate onward
43:22 - well and i think we're kind of all
43:24 - saying the same thing here to a certain
43:25 - extent but i'll kind of be the bad guy
43:27 - on the stage to a certain extent
43:30 - coming from industry prior to getting
43:31 - into education i i have a different view
43:34 - of education in our public education
43:36 - system than a lot of traditional
43:37 - educators
43:38 - i view public education as an investment
43:41 - it's an investment in tomorrow's
43:43 - workforce and whenever we approach
43:45 - policies when we approach
43:47 - implementation when we approach where
43:49 - we're putting our priorities our funding
43:52 - our resources if we can't draw a direct
43:56 - return on investment plan based on those
43:59 - those interjections are based on those
44:01 - resources then we really should step
44:03 - back and say as an educational community
44:06 - is this where we should be placing our
44:08 - resources now that's not to say i don't
44:10 - value things like the arts
44:13 - my son is incompetent my eldest son is
44:15 - in competitive band he loves that he
44:18 - also loves computer science not just
44:20 - because i tell him he has to but because
44:21 - he actually loves it
44:23 - but
44:23 - we need these other things kind of like
44:25 - seth alluded to to sometimes keep
44:28 - students interested beyond those those
44:30 - other things but that again
44:32 - is a workforce reason that is a reason
44:35 - because we want our kids engaged in
44:37 - school we want them going to school
44:38 - regularly we want them to have a reason
44:41 - to not get in trouble and get suspended
44:43 - which might be that they don't want to
44:44 - get dropped out of competitive band
44:46 - but they have to be there to learn these
44:49 - other skills and if we're not looking at
44:51 - education as an investment and the
44:53 - resources we're putting into it as a
44:55 - future investment in our future
44:57 - workforce why are we doing it
45:01 - thank you all i want to turn it over to
45:03 - the audience and uh open it up to
45:05 - questions so
45:06 - [Music]
45:08 - any questions for our wonderful panel
45:13 - did i just speak loudly is that okay
45:14 - yeah i'll repeat it
45:16 - so my question is around
45:19 - stand-alone computer science courses
45:20 - versus integrated computer science
45:23 - courses and so both states i believe
45:26 - have that graduation requirement
45:28 - within that requirement does it allow
45:31 - for both or is it more standalone
45:33 - computer science courses that are
45:35 - required
45:36 - so does the for the people watching at
45:38 - home uh does the graduation requirement
45:41 - include integrated computer science
45:43 - courses or stand-alone computer science
45:45 - courses
45:46 - so for the graduation requirement we
45:48 - have developed over 60 courses and they
45:50 - are standalone courses but they're in
45:52 - things like data science robotics the
45:54 - our year one courses
45:56 - when we wrote those in this last
45:58 - iteration we really looked at what would
46:00 - be all skills that all students who are
46:03 - entering the workforce if that was the
46:04 - minimum level of computing and computer
46:06 - science skills that they had what would
46:08 - be that minimum skill set that that
46:10 - industry would need but on the other
46:12 - flip side of this and we're not talking
46:14 - about this today in this panel but i'll
46:16 - mention we also require all of our
46:19 - students to
46:20 - engage in computer science at the k-8
46:22 - environment and guess what it is
46:25 - embedded or integrated throughout our
46:27 - k-8 environment so we approach it from a
46:30 - bo both standpoint but
46:32 - in arkansas we do believe that once you
46:34 - get to that high school level if you've
46:36 - built that integration throughout those
46:38 - k levels properly
46:40 - then you need to start looking at what
46:42 - are those specialized areas that those
46:44 - students may focus on whether it be
46:46 - programming like most most computer
46:48 - people think is computer science or data
46:51 - science or computer engineering or
46:52 - robotics or cyber security or networking
46:55 - so we've developed nine state pathways
46:59 - that are centered around those those
47:01 - different threads and artificial
47:03 - intelligence and machine learning i
47:05 - leave that one out i forget about it all
47:06 - the time because it's one of our newest
47:07 - ones but
47:09 - we we have pathways of three courses
47:12 - that do specialize and we do require
47:14 - that siloed if you want to call it
47:16 - course
47:17 - but that course is built around
47:18 - competencies that every student should
47:20 - have
47:22 - yeah and just to to add to that you have
47:25 - to have
47:26 - that define that definition for computer
47:30 - science or else your graduation
47:32 - requirement is going to be something
47:34 - that is deluded and so yeah on the k
47:37 - through eight side there is that
47:38 - integration to show how it fits with
47:40 - everything but just as
47:43 - um if you're getting direction somewhere
47:45 - there are multiple ways to get there
47:47 - once you get to your specific place
47:49 - there's a defined path to to get to that
47:53 - location and so the computer science
47:55 - grad courses there are arranged from
47:58 - introduction or introductory courses
48:00 - onto those highly specialized courses
48:02 - that can count with a specific
48:04 - definition so what does every child need
48:07 - to know when they're going through a
48:08 - particular course and then what do they
48:10 - need for these specific areas we have
48:13 - done that
48:14 - and scaled that out so when that student
48:18 - continues on and cr and
48:20 - and increases their depth of knowledge
48:22 - in computer science they have a specific
48:25 - skill set i will say selfishly that is
48:28 - to prepare them for workforce right um
48:31 - and so it is to ensure that when they
48:33 - leave they have that competitive
48:35 - advantage and i think if we're not doing
48:36 - that
48:38 - then why are we doing what we're doing
48:59 - were there any certification issues you
49:01 - ran into
49:02 - with implementing the graduation
49:03 - requirement before or after
49:07 - okay
49:08 - good good angel so i was going to say we
49:10 - did identify a certification area
49:14 - prior to implementing the standards that
49:16 - was done first so we had that support in
49:18 - place however
49:20 - we didn't we couldn't find the teachers
49:22 - that wanted to to do what they needed to
49:24 - do right to get that certification it's
49:26 - hard that's this hard
49:28 - and so after engaging in that and and
49:31 - and then
49:32 - seeing the gaps
49:34 - we then began to create opportunities
49:37 - for endorsements so not necessarily
49:39 - certification a full cert but
49:41 - endorsement to teach the introductory
49:43 - courses right with specific training
49:45 - that we we identified and provided for
49:49 - was able to provide a stipend for
49:50 - teachers to do that as well in addition
49:53 - creating those areas and avenues for
49:55 - work base those individuals coming from
49:57 - industry to be able to teach courses and
50:01 - then
50:02 - most recently adding on a micro
50:04 - credentialing piece
50:06 - as a pilot to show how you can get the
50:09 - certification or the full cert with
50:12 - specialized knowledge in a particular
50:14 - area
50:15 - through demonstration and not
50:17 - necessarily on a test and as a former
50:20 - teacher
50:21 - i appreciate when someone can
50:23 - demonstrate by passing a test but if you
50:25 - can show me that you can teach that to a
50:27 - child
50:28 - that's i appreciate that more that's
50:30 - more beneficial
50:32 - and i'm just going to say it really is
50:34 - an ongoing process no matter how strong
50:36 - a foundation you you build in arkansas
50:38 - we did build a strong foundation i
50:40 - mentioned this in the last session that
50:42 - one of the first things we did in this
50:43 - initiative is we identified a clear
50:45 - pathway to licensure
50:47 - why is it in some states it's very clear
50:49 - how you become a secondary math teacher
50:51 - but it automatically gets confusing when
50:53 - we start talking about cs why is there
50:55 - not a clear pathway so we established
50:58 - that in arkansas early on so teachers
51:00 - could understand and guess what we went
51:02 - from under 50 teachers that we could
51:05 - identify with some type of credentialing
51:07 - to teach computer science which was ap
51:09 - csa back then to we're right at 600
51:12 - certified teachers in arkansas in a
51:14 - period of about six years so
51:17 - it can be done there has to be support
51:19 - mechanisms in place there has to be
51:21 - resources there to to drive reasoning
51:23 - for that
51:25 - and but there also has to be a
51:27 - clear sequencing for teachers to follow
51:30 - teachers want to do this a lot of
51:32 - teachers want to do this they just don't
51:33 - want to jump through a lot of hoops that
51:35 - don't have a clearly defined pathway or
51:38 - they don't see a reason for it so we've
51:41 - really made that process i won't say
51:43 - easy in arkansas it's not easy
51:45 - but it is clear
51:51 - any other questions
51:56 - all right well i have another one for
51:58 - you both um
52:00 - arkansas south carolina
52:02 - 90 of high schools are offering computer
52:04 - science
52:05 - nine yes ninety two come on
52:07 - [Laughter]
52:11 - all right so why uh why a graduation
52:14 - requirement you already have uh the vast
52:16 - majority of your schools offering
52:18 - computer science
52:20 - well i'll kind of turn that back around
52:22 - on a question back to you
52:25 - why do we require algebra
52:27 - for a graduation for every student even
52:29 - though all of our schools are teaching
52:30 - algebra okay
52:32 - it's really it's it's it comes down to
52:34 - this idea
52:35 - that at some point in history within
52:37 - each of our states
52:39 - there was some regulatory or legislative
52:42 - body that said algebra is a critical
52:45 - component for every student to have
52:47 - before they leave our high schools
52:49 - english one two three four
52:52 - in our state for example is a critical
52:54 - component that every student that they
52:57 - must have before they leave high school
52:59 - at some point there was some regulatory
53:01 - or legislative body that said
53:03 - this is important for our future
53:05 - workforce to have
53:07 - arkansas said you know what
53:10 - we've been doing computer science as an
53:12 - option for six years we built this
53:14 - foundation it is now time for us as a
53:16 - state us as a legislative body or them
53:18 - as a legislative body
53:20 - and the governor to say it is our time
53:23 - in history to say this is a critical
53:25 - critical component or
53:27 - knowledge set that every one of our
53:29 - students should have before they enter
53:31 - in workforce so you know it it goes back
53:34 - to it is a natural progression of what
53:38 - education looks like i started this by
53:40 - saying the two words that i hate we've
53:42 - always
53:44 - in education we have to stop the weave
53:46 - always we have to start the
53:48 - what do we need to do
53:51 - and so why acs grad requirement thank
53:54 - you anthony because my answer is why not
53:58 - why not a cs grad requirement because we
54:01 - don't have that option of whether or not
54:03 - we engage with the things that require
54:05 - cs and so if we don't have that option
54:08 - then we can't afford for that to be an
54:10 - option for our students who are going to
54:12 - be going into the workforce so you say
54:14 - why i say why not
54:17 - typical educators ask us a question
54:19 - we're going to ask you a question back
54:20 - that's it
54:24 - all right um and oh
54:27 - yes
54:48 - uh when should the computer science
54:50 - community lean into requiring computer
54:53 - science for graduation
54:55 - so i'm going to say now but i say that
54:58 - with caution you have to create the
55:01 - awareness first right
55:04 - and i think that in any requirement
55:07 - there has to be the transition so you
55:09 - have to have a long runway so that
55:11 - people can feel supported and that you
55:13 - have
55:15 - done what is necessary to build the
55:17 - infrastructure
55:18 - so that you can get there so the thing
55:22 - is getting there right once you get
55:23 - there creating another goal to go
55:25 - further
55:26 - you cannot give directions
55:29 - to a particular place and say drive in
55:31 - your car and go there if you have not
55:32 - provided the roadway or the
55:34 - infrastructure for you to be able to get
55:36 - there so i think it's about creating the
55:38 - access and then going beyond access to
55:40 - engagement and before you can do all of
55:43 - that you must have awareness so
55:45 - now is the time
55:48 - i think we're already too late
55:51 - however when you are doing that create
55:53 - that awareness with your shareholders
55:55 - first and the north star being workforce
55:59 - and i would say you know knowing i
56:01 - advise a lot of states on their
56:03 - strategic planning i think last count
56:04 - i'm up to like 27 of helping them with
56:07 - their strategic planning for the cs
56:08 - initiative and i know code.org's
56:10 - perspective on this they have to look at
56:13 - what can be done or what should they
56:15 - recommend what should they put their
56:16 - resources behind
56:18 - in getting states who make
56:21 - to see equity in computer science to
56:23 - build that that capacity for all
56:25 - cameron my response to that question
56:27 - honestly would be
56:29 - i don't see that right now the
56:31 - graduation requirement is a foundational
56:34 - piece to computer science it is a
56:35 - stretch goal
56:37 - it is something that states should be
56:39 - building to attain in the future at some
56:41 - point if they're not ready for it so if
56:43 - you look at the nine policy suggestions
56:45 - for cs we agree as a community they're
56:48 - all foundational
56:50 - but why do we have to try to pigeonhole
56:52 - the graduation requirement or these
56:53 - other pieces into
56:55 - 10
56:57 - suggestions why not look at we have
57:00 - these nine foundational suggestions that
57:02 - code.org is still going to continue to
57:04 - place a lot of emphasis and support
57:05 - behind but knowing that we have these
57:08 - some marketing person can come with a
57:10 - much better term than i can but we have
57:12 - these stretch goals that every state
57:15 - should be looking at why are we building
57:17 - these foundation pieces
57:19 - and what can eventually happen yeah
57:22 - but i agree with angel 100
57:24 - now is the time to start as a state
57:26 - thinking about how you're going to get
57:28 - to that down the road
57:31 - thank you um so
57:33 - as we wrap up i'd like to leave everyone
57:36 - with some final thoughts uh from you all
57:38 - so what is something uh briefly what is
57:40 - something you've learned what is
57:42 - something you do differently or what is
57:44 - something you wish you knew
57:46 - or what is just something you think the
57:48 - group should know
57:52 - seth i'm going to put you on the spot
57:53 - and make you go first
57:55 - well i think um you know the the main
57:58 - thing even just coming off of yesterday
58:00 - that is so critically important and
58:01 - we'll make sure to engage governors on
58:03 - is i think that international panel and
58:05 - it comes off something anthony asks of
58:06 - what should uh
58:08 - states as they're thinking about this
58:10 - not do and that is to just only focus on
58:12 - the high school piece but to start in
58:13 - those early grades i think that that
58:15 - report that they were talking about has
58:17 - such
58:18 - you know relevance as to systems that
58:20 - have tried certain things and what has
58:22 - worked and what is not and making sure
58:23 - that as
58:24 - governors are moving forward on their
58:26 - work and within their sake context that
58:29 - they're aware of not only what has
58:30 - worked but what has not in the in the
58:32 - past
58:36 - um and to add to that i'm going to say
58:39 - that
58:39 - yeah the focus can not only be on the
58:41 - high school aspect
58:43 - has to be in the k through 8 realm and
58:46 - it has to be with post-secondary options
58:49 - for me as a woman of color
58:52 - i also would like to see
58:55 - more of a mandate on the diversity in
58:57 - the corporate area so once these
58:59 - students have the hope and the
59:00 - aspiration and they're empowered to move
59:02 - forward where do they have to go where
59:05 - they're represented and they're able to
59:08 - do what is necessary to be globally
59:10 - competitive
59:13 - um and i would i would say something
59:15 - that we've approached this entire
59:17 - building up through is that
59:20 - we place our funding in people
59:22 - okay not programs now that's not to say
59:25 - that we don't have great vendor partners
59:27 - i mentioned learning blade earlier
59:29 - but
59:30 - we take a very close look at how our
59:33 - state dollars are being spent
59:35 - and we spend that as an investment in
59:37 - people because that builds long-term
59:40 - capacity that builds
59:42 - a community person who is the champion
59:45 - of that instead of paying someone a
59:48 - large sum of money to come in and tell
59:50 - you and your people what you should be
59:52 - doing for three years and that funding
59:54 - dries up or they that company gets into
59:57 - something else and they leave the state
59:58 - and they leave this vacuum and
60:00 - everybody's like what happened
60:02 - so place your money in building up your
60:04 - people building up your teachers
60:05 - building up
60:06 - specialists i'm so glad to see that you
60:09 - are going to hire four cs specialists
60:11 - let me know when you get to 10 and don't
60:13 - try to hire any mine away
60:15 - but
60:17 - but put your money into people and and
60:19 - that will be that will be uh beneficial
