00:06 - You know how when you look up the lyrics for
a song and they define the chorus at the very
00:10 - beginning and then for the rest of the song,
they just refer you back to the chorus?
00:16 - That's how you call a function.
00:18 - In this lesson, we define the chorus at the
beginning of our song and then we sing through
00:23 - our song and go back and we notice that the
class doesn't sing the word chorus, they automatically
00:30 - go up to the top where we define the chorus
and sing through that.
00:35 - We use that as a great introduction to how
to understand what a program is doing when
00:40 - it defines and calls a function.
00:43 - We use familiar songs including Old Macdonald
to talk about how a chorus is called over
00:48 - and over and how sometimes a chorus can change.
00:52 - When you have a song like Old Macdonald, where
certain words change, that's a great place
00:56 - to introduce the idea of parameters.
00:59 - Passing certain words through so that you
can send extra information to your function.
01:04 - Once we're sure everybody gets it, you can
take your own familiar songs and break them
01:09 - up yourself.
01:10 - See if you can figure it out together.
