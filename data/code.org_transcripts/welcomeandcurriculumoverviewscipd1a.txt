00:05 - hello and welcome my name is Irene Lee
00:08 - I'm the director of Santa Fe Institute's
00:10 - Learning Lab over the past seven years
00:12 - we've developed and refined project guts
00:15 - growing up thinking scientifically
00:19 - project guts is a middle school program
00:21 - that engages students in modeling and
00:23 - simulation of complex adaptive systems
00:27 - we're thrilled to be partnering with
00:29 - code.org to be offering this curriculum
00:31 - for middle school students well computer
00:35 - modeling is a fantastic tool to
00:37 - introduce into middle schools because
00:39 - it's particularly in science because it
00:43 - really takes the student out of the book
00:45 - so for example if you're in a in a town
00:48 - that maybe has issues with water
00:50 - availability like you're suffering
00:52 - through a drought it's one thing to tell
00:54 - a kid you know turn the faucet off while
00:56 - you're brushing your teeth your teeth
00:58 - and they might think well this is really
00:59 - not that much you know it's not having
01:02 - that much of an effect but if they
01:04 - actually model all of the water
01:06 - resources available say in their town
01:09 - and they can see what the effect is of
01:12 - not just one person performing a certain
01:14 - action but the whole town performing it
01:16 - they suddenly come to a better
01:18 - understanding of their role in the
01:20 - system you can explore any problem so
01:24 - thoroughly with a model whereas when you
01:26 - do a laboratory experiment you're only
01:27 - doing like a very small portion of that
01:29 - exploration I'm able to kind of just
01:32 - give them a little bit of information
01:34 - and then watch them grow and watch them
01:36 - expand on that and they're able to share
01:39 - more with their peers and ask more
01:41 - questions and if they need to you know
01:43 - they're doing great at doing some
01:45 - research and going online and finding
01:47 - their own answers and not having to come
01:48 - to the teacher for every little thing
01:50 - I'm there for support
01:52 - but I kind of feel like I'm more in the
01:55 - learning situation and the same with
01:56 - them we're learning together the reason
01:59 - I like it so much is because it teaches
02:00 - I use for computers beyond video games
02:02 - it teaches students how to own a
02:05 - computer instead of just use a computer
02:07 - our curriculum aligns to achieve next
02:10 - generation science standards
02:12 - which are based on a framework for k-12
02:15 - science education developed by the
02:18 - National Research Council and thus they
02:21 - can replace select earth life and
02:24 - physical science units without the need
02:26 - for additional class time as we
02:29 - developed our curriculum we worked
02:31 - closely with current middle school
02:33 - teachers and students it's important to
02:35 - us that our work be teacher and student
02:38 - friendly scientifically rigorous and
02:40 - relevant in diverse communities our
02:43 - modules and lessons also leverage years
02:46 - of our own National Science
02:47 - foundation-funded educational research
02:50 - it is our goal that in addition to
02:53 - deepening students understanding of
02:55 - fundamental science concepts and
02:56 - practice our curriculum increases your
02:59 - students skill and comfort levels in
03:02 - computer science so they feel excited
03:04 - and ready to pursue formal year-long
03:07 - computer science classes when they
03:09 - attend high school we hope this will be
03:11 - a great learning experience for your
03:13 - students over the years we have seen
03:16 - many students experience the excitement
03:18 - of discovery as they act as young
03:20 - scientists harnessing the power of
03:23 - modeling and simulation to better
03:24 - understand their world most of all we
03:27 - want to thank you the teachers for
03:29 - taking on this new opportunity and
03:31 - committing to develop your own
03:33 - understanding of modern scientific
03:35 - practice have fun we're glad you're part
03:38 - of our program
