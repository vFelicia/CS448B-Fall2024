00:06 - By now, you've gotten comfortable using evaluation
blocks to represent numbers and functions
00:12 - that work on those numbers.
00:14 - But our programming language can do so much
more.
00:17 - Take a look at this evaluation block.
00:20 - What is the name of this function?
00:23 - What inputs does it take?
00:25 - The first input is clearly a number but what
about the other two?
00:30 - The values solid and red are a new type of
data called string.
00:35 - No, not like yarn.
00:37 - It's called a string because it is any number
of characters, letters, numbers, even punctuation
00:43 - strung together and surrounded by quotation
marks.
00:47 - We usually use strings to represent words.
00:50 - A type is a category of values.
00:53 - 1, 2, negative 10 and 100.6 are all examples
of numbers.
00:59 - And solid, red or hello my name is Nancy are
all examples of strings.
01:06 - Anything in quotation marks is a string, even
numbers.
01:10 - When we evaluate this program, we'll get a
picture of a solid red star.
01:16 - That isn't a number and it isn't a string.
01:19 - Instead, it's a third type of data called
an image.
01:23 - Values are specific like 15 or hello but types
are general.
01:28 - You probably notice that this code is a lot
more colorful than what you wrote in the last
01:32 - stage.
01:34 - Evaluation blocks are color-coded to tell
you what type of data they will return.
01:38 - The slots are color coded by the type of data
they need.
01:43 - Just as you can't put a round peg in a square
hole, you can't put a purple block in a blue
01:48 - slot.
01:50 - Numbers are blue, strings are teal and images
are purple.
01:55 - In this next stage, you'll start by using
these new data types in your program to create
01:59 - shapes and images.
