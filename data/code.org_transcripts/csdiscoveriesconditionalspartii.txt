00:06 - sometimes the decisions you will want
00:08 - your program to make have more than two
00:10 - possible outcomes
00:12 - let's continue our movie rating example
00:15 - where we want to check whether the
00:16 - highest rating you can go see alone is
00:19 - an r-rated movie a pg-13 movie or just a
00:23 - g-rated movie to check between these
00:26 - three different cases we can add an
00:28 - else--if statement an else--if statement
00:31 - is another condition but a program
00:33 - checks only if the previous if
00:35 - statements were false
00:37 - so if age is greater than or equal to 17
00:42 - right that user can see an r-rated movie
00:44 - alone else if the age is greater than or
00:48 - equal to 13 right that the user can see
00:52 - a pg-13 movie alone
00:54 - else rice if the user can see a g-rated
00:58 - movie alone the else condition becomes
01:01 - the default condition because when all
01:04 - the previous is San else if statements
01:06 - are false it will default to the else
01:08 - statement be careful as you can struck
01:11 - longer sequences of else if statements
01:13 - if you mix up the order you might not
01:16 - get the behavior you intended in our
01:19 - example imagine we had switched the code
01:21 - so that the first condition check if the
01:24 - user was old enough to see pg-13 movies
01:26 - like this this would mean that everyone
01:30 - who is 13 or older would be told they
01:33 - can only see pg-13 movies even the
01:36 - adults and with the next else--if line
01:39 - the computer would be looking for people
01:41 - 17 or older in the remaining group this
01:44 - code misses the adults because they were
01:47 - true in that first condition this won't
01:50 - work the computer checks the conditions
01:52 - from top to bottom so it is important to
01:55 - enter the most specific conditions first
