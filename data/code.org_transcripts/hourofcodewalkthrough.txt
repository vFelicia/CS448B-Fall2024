00:04 - this december we are recruiting 10
00:06 - million students from across the united
00:08 - states to participate in an hour of code
00:11 - and we need your help to make it happen
00:13 - the hour of code is an hour-long
00:15 - introduction to computer science for all
00:17 - students no previous experience is
00:19 - required and the activities are designed
00:20 - to be self-guided empowering students to
00:23 - learn at their own pace
00:24 - this matters because the number of
00:26 - computing jobs in this country is rising
00:28 - three times faster than the number of
00:30 - computer science graduates at this rate
00:32 - by 2020 there will be more than one
00:34 - million computing jobs unfilled and
00:36 - these are good jobs
00:38 - we expect to have more than a dozen
00:40 - different one-hour tutorials to choose
00:42 - from each introducing computer science
00:44 - in its own way for all students from
00:46 - k-12
00:47 - for example we are expecting one
00:49 - tutorial to teach how to create an
00:51 - interactive card using the programming
00:53 - environment scratch
00:54 - another will teach the basics of
00:56 - programming using minecraft a popular
00:58 - game
00:59 - our own tutorial will introduce some
01:00 - computer science principles through a
01:02 - series of puzzles that are fun to solve
01:06 - you can offer the hour of code on a
01:07 - range of devices including tablets pcs
01:10 - macs and smartphones
01:12 - there will even be unplugged tutorials
01:14 - that can be completed without any
01:16 - computers at all
01:18 - now let's talk about how to run the hour
01:19 - of code itself
01:21 - you can do the hour of code anytime
01:23 - between december 9th and december 15th
01:25 - that's computer science education week
01:28 - our goal is to have at least 10 million
01:30 - students do an hour of code sometime
01:32 - during that week
01:34 - the first thing you'll need to figure
01:35 - out is where you will do your hour of
01:37 - code
01:38 - one option is to use a computer lab with
01:40 - internet connected pcs or macs
01:42 - another option is to do the hour of code
01:44 - in your classroom using tablets or
01:45 - smartphones as long as they can access
01:47 - the internet
01:49 - students can also take turns doing the
01:50 - hour of code in your classroom using a
01:52 - shared internet connected computer in
01:55 - fact we encourage students to do the
01:56 - hour of code together in pairs or small
01:58 - groups research shows that students
02:00 - retain more when they're programmed
02:01 - together
02:03 - the unplugged options can be done
02:04 - anywhere even outdoors these activities
02:07 - are especially fun for groups and really
02:09 - illustrate the point computational
02:11 - thinking does not require a computer
02:14 - next you'll need to select which
02:15 - tutorial to use
02:17 - the week before the hour of code you
02:18 - will be able to visit our website to
02:20 - preview the available tutorials
02:22 - if you're not sure which tutorial to
02:23 - pick we'll recommend one for you
02:25 - we encourage you to try doing the
02:27 - selected tutorial yourself before your
02:29 - class does it so you can answer any
02:31 - questions that might come up
02:33 - finally it will be time for your
02:34 - students to do the hour of code
02:35 - themselves have them visit our website
02:38 - and choose the tutorial that you
02:39 - selected
02:40 - if you're doing an unplugged tutorial
02:42 - pass out the materials and explain the
02:44 - rules
02:45 - your students will enjoy doing the hour
02:47 - of code the tutorials are designed to be
02:49 - fun students who finish early can try a
02:51 - different perhaps more advanced tutorial
02:53 - or help other students
02:55 - and that's it as you've seen offering
02:57 - the hour of code your students is easy
02:59 - it requires minimal prior preparation
03:01 - and no prior experience in just one hour
03:04 - you'll have given your students an
03:05 - engaging and meaningful exposure to the
03:07 - world of computer science and help
03:09 - demystify what can be an intimidating
03:11 - subject to some go to
03:13 - csedweek.org to register now and help us
03:16 - make history
