00:10 - hello everyone welcome my name is
00:13 - kanikiha and i'm a curriculum
00:15 - development manager here at code.org
00:18 - as a curriculum development manager
00:20 - that means i get to make lessons make
00:23 - activities uh make lessons plans lesson
00:26 - plans and gather feedback about how all
00:28 - of those things are working in
00:30 - classrooms from teachers and students
00:31 - like yourself who are tuning in today
00:33 - i'm really excited to
00:36 - join you all today and thanks to all the
00:37 - classrooms who are tuning in
00:39 - for today's my journey class chat
00:42 - teachers we've enabled live closed
00:44 - captioning for all of our class chats
00:47 - today we are excited and lucky to
00:49 - welcome bertrand st prue as a product
00:52 - manager at snap who started and lead
00:54 - snap's inclusive camera team to ensure
00:57 - snap's camera works well for everyone
00:59 - regardless of their skin tone cultural
01:01 - background beauty standards or ability
01:04 - teachers please let us know where you're
01:06 - tuning in from
01:07 - and put your students questions for
01:09 - bertrand in the q a we'll try our best
01:11 - to get to some of those during the chat
01:12 - today
01:14 - uh
01:15 - merchant will start with a uh fun
01:17 - icebreaker uh so it's just a little
01:19 - would you rather would you rather be
01:21 - able to
01:22 - breathe underwater or be able to
01:25 - fly and i'll go first uh i think i'm
01:28 - gonna say
01:30 - flying i just i think the the idea of
01:32 - moving quickly through the air is a cool
01:34 - sensation and the the views that you
01:37 - could get from being able to fly are
01:39 - definitely uh something that i would
01:42 - treasure so how about yourself
01:44 - i'd definitely say flying as well um
01:47 - this it would make traveling so much
01:49 - easier there's so many places i'd be
01:50 - able to go
01:51 - um and i wouldn't need a car
01:55 - yeah for sure where someone where
01:57 - somewhere you would want to fly where
01:58 - you would want to travel if you had that
01:59 - ability japan easily japan
02:02 - oh very cool very cool my
02:05 - my my father's side of the family is
02:06 - from japan so i've lived there for a
02:08 - year so that's that's awesome cool very
02:10 - cool well uh well welcome bertrand again
02:13 - thanks for joining us today um we'd love
02:16 - to just start with a little uh
02:17 - introduction from yourself and if you
02:19 - could tell us a little bit about your
02:20 - work and what you do at snack
02:23 - yeah um so again my name is beatron
02:25 - sampua or bertrand st prue
02:27 - i'm a product manager at snapchat um and
02:31 - i work
02:32 - to build products to make the camera
02:34 - more inclusive no matter who you are um
02:37 - your skin tone your race culture beauty
02:40 - standards or just whoever you are
02:42 - essentially making the camera work for
02:43 - you uh and so that is a really really
02:46 - fun and impactful project that i'm
02:48 - really happy to say i work on
02:50 - um
02:51 - and
02:52 - yeah oh and i'm also from miami florida
02:55 - and if you can tell from my name or not
02:56 - um i'm very haitian which is a
02:59 - country in the caribbean um yeah
03:02 - awesome cool well um yeah you mentioned
03:06 - this inclusive camera i wonder if you
03:08 - could just tell us what what is it and
03:11 - and just maybe give us a little bit more
03:12 - background about it about it
03:14 - yeah so the inclusive camera is
03:16 - essentially um a way in which uh snap is
03:20 - working to recreate the camera um to
03:23 - work better for folk the camera has
03:25 - unfortunately not worked um inclusively
03:27 - of everyone uh
03:29 - in its history it started off um working
03:32 - for for lighter skin tones because the
03:35 - shirley card and various other uh the
03:37 - surely card which is a color correction
03:39 - card um that folks used to use to go
03:41 - into
03:42 - um photo hut this is way back in like
03:44 - the 1940s and 50s well into our parents
03:47 - and parents uh grandparents um when they
03:50 - used to go develop their photos it was
03:51 - all developed against a photo um of a
03:54 - woman who was white uh and it had the
03:57 - caption normal on it and so if you were
03:59 - never a person who
04:01 - uh
04:02 - who
04:03 - identified as a lighter-skinned person
04:06 - um and you went to get your photos
04:07 - developed then they just wouldn't be
04:09 - looking as good as they could be and so
04:11 - that history went on into the digital
04:14 - age and
04:16 - yeah that's what caused us at snap to be
04:18 - able to want to create an inclusive
04:20 - camera which recreates and rewrites the
04:22 - way that cameras are made
04:24 - from the process and software level on
04:26 - to better
04:28 - be able to take a picture of everyone no
04:30 - matter who you are
04:31 - and so there's a little bit of a
04:34 - video that i have to explain this a bit
04:36 - more
04:37 - um
04:39 - well uh well bertrand gets that video
04:40 - ready i just wanted to welcome folks
04:43 - joining from dover delaware pittsburgh
04:46 - sacramento north dakota so good to have
04:48 - people from all over the country joining
04:49 - today
05:01 - i think people of color assume that
05:03 - their skin tones are difficult to
05:04 - photograph because they've seen
05:06 - themselves in lights that are not
05:07 - complementary to how they look and
05:10 - that's absolutely not the case
05:12 - when you look at the camera technology
05:14 - when you look at the history of it
05:17 - when you look at how image making has
05:18 - evolved throughout the years
05:21 - there's some actual technological
05:24 - limitations when it comes to how we show
05:26 - up on screen
05:28 - my name is bertrand sampua
05:31 - and i am the lead for the inclusive
05:33 - camera i've experienced situations where
05:36 - like my skin has been lightened by the
05:37 - camera taking photos of myself and just
05:39 - like it doesn't work especially in low
05:41 - light settings you don't see me
05:44 - so i really want to improve that
05:46 - experience for myself and for the
05:47 - community
05:48 - my mom picking up a phone is assuming
05:50 - that this phone has the best interest
05:52 - for her skin tone and who she is and the
05:54 - photos she wants to take
05:56 - but there's that assumption there that
05:58 - it should be figured out already but it
06:00 - really isn't a lot of times camera
06:02 - companies are registering our skin
06:03 - colors as shadows instead of as skin so
06:06 - it just kind of becomes muddy
06:09 - the inclusive camera is just a camera
06:11 - that allows any person to be seen by the
06:12 - camera the way that they want to be seen
06:14 - the way that they are
06:16 - i love having a balance of like this was
06:18 - made with everybody in mind because that
06:20 - opens up a whole other path of like what
06:22 - creativity could look like when it's
06:24 - actually being made with good purpose
06:27 - you see that saturation that comes in it
06:29 - lifts it a lot it feels like there's a
06:31 - filter on it
06:34 - want every time that you open the
06:35 - snapchat camera to be a moment that you
06:36 - feel as though you can express yourself
06:38 - any way that you want to
06:40 - it's not going to be an easy journey and
06:42 - rebuilding our camera is just the first
06:44 - phase
06:44 - improving low light flash capture and
06:46 - exposure correction so that we can
06:48 - account for all people's skin tones and
06:50 - their undertones so that any person
06:52 - whatever phone they're picking up
06:53 - they're able to take a good selfie
06:55 - and this
06:56 - is just the beginning
07:07 - awesome bertrand thanks for sharing that
07:09 - video um
07:12 - you mentioned your title being a product
07:15 - manager and i feel like that that video
07:17 - showed some of some of your you at work
07:19 - a little bit and so i wonder if you
07:21 - could kind of talk about your role in
07:23 - this project i said you're the lead but
07:25 - what what is like the day-to-day what
07:27 - has that process been like of guiding
07:29 - that project
07:31 - yeah so um being a product manager uh
07:34 - pretty much means that like you define
07:36 - the vision of the product and from end
07:38 - to end from the concept of the product
07:40 - all the way to like it being released
07:42 - and even then after you're working with
07:44 - engineers designers and everyone in
07:46 - between to make sure that the product
07:47 - needs to be exactly what it needs to be
07:49 - for the community and especially in this
07:50 - case for the inclusive camera we're like
07:52 - redefining the whole like typical
07:54 - product um development process and so i
07:57 - work with a ton of photographers um
07:59 - someone which some of which you saw
08:01 - i work with like marketing and comms and
08:04 - just various folk to understand and tell
08:07 - like how do we tell the story to the
08:08 - community um and help them understand
08:10 - the product so it's a lot of hats that
08:13 - you get to wear as a product manager
08:14 - you're pretty much like the middle
08:15 - person of everything to make sure that
08:17 - the product is what it needs to be
08:21 - yeah i wonder that's
08:23 - so cool you get to interact with so many
08:24 - different people and like in super
08:27 - collaborative um i think that's
08:29 - something that uh you know students and
08:31 - teachers watching probably hopefully
08:32 - resonate with kind of that collaborative
08:34 - nature of computer science and building
08:36 - something together
08:38 - kind of can make it a fun subject
08:40 - i wonder you know you mentioned the
08:42 - photographers just because we saw them
08:43 - in the video could you talk a little bit
08:45 - about the
08:46 - the contribution
08:48 - um that they you know how did that back
08:50 - and forth go and what was their
08:52 - contribution to the the vision like you
08:54 - said
08:55 - yeah absolutely so um when i
08:58 - when i started this project and pitched
09:00 - it to the to the uh to the team um
09:04 - one thing that we realized was just that
09:06 - like
09:07 - even though we're a camera company and
09:08 - we have a camera team i was on the
09:11 - camera team even before um joining this
09:13 - project that there aren't any
09:14 - photographers on the camera team and so
09:17 - like what does it look like to actually
09:18 - bring those folk in and have them tune
09:20 - our algorithms for us so we created
09:22 - tools for them to be able to like um
09:24 - computational photography tools which is
09:26 - pretty much photography and technology
09:28 - and like how do you build photography
09:30 - into code which is what computational
09:33 - photography is and so we built a bunch
09:34 - of those algorithms and
09:37 - were a few of those algorithms and we
09:40 - we had them
09:41 - go through and tune it in similar to
09:43 - like photoshop like what does it look
09:45 - like for these algorithms to work on
09:46 - different people so we translated what
09:50 - we do is we work with them and they told
09:51 - us like what they would do with the
09:53 - normal dslr camera like the nikon
09:55 - cameras or kodak cameras um and we
09:58 - converted that into code so that our
10:00 - algorithms can work really
10:02 - well very cool um
10:06 - i also know
10:07 - that uh you know in the video i
10:09 - mentioned like some features of like
10:10 - flash correction and things like that
10:12 - like i wonder if you could talk more
10:13 - about some of the specific things that
10:15 - that have come out of this project yeah
10:17 - absolutely and i'm happy to be able to
10:19 - show some as well uh so pretty much one
10:22 - of the things that was just that was
10:23 - mentioned in that video was that we um
10:26 - work with these photographers not just
10:28 - on our algorithms but just to understand
10:29 - like flash capture and how to light
10:31 - people uh in lower light and so one of
10:34 - the features that we released is ring
10:35 - flash so in uh when folks are usually
10:38 - taking a flash if you use snapchat um
10:41 - and you're on the front facing camera
10:43 - and you go and take uh use flash and
10:45 - like it's really dark outside or dark
10:47 - inside or outside and like flashes on
10:50 - your face and you look at yourself like
10:51 - oh my goodness i did not realize that's
10:52 - what i look like um it happens to me all
10:55 - the times or it used to happen to me all
10:56 - the time um until
10:59 - we built ring flash which as i'm trying
11:02 - to share my screen give me this moment
11:05 - um
11:07 - oh we built ring flash which
11:09 - uh essentially
11:11 - illuminates the border around your
11:12 - screen um so that you can better take
11:16 - uh snaps at night and so
11:20 - while bertrand just gets that up uh just
11:23 - teachers out there and students feel
11:25 - free to keep submitting questions in the
11:26 - q a and we'll try our best to get to
11:29 - those uh later in the conversation but
11:31 - happy to submit those
11:39 - [Music]
11:51 - so
11:52 - usually when you're taking flash and
11:53 - actually i'm gonna make it darker in
11:54 - here so that y'all can truly see oh my
11:58 - goodness huh
12:11 - and so
12:12 - when it is darker in here and you
12:14 - take the flash i did not really know
12:16 - what i look like and oh this is uh i'll
12:20 - tell you what that is a little bit later
12:23 - but what ring flash does it illuminates
12:26 - the border around your screen
12:27 - so that you can better see yourself
12:30 - while you're taking the snap
12:35 - and so when it's really dark it works
12:36 - much better of course
12:38 - and then what makes it inclusive is that
12:40 - we understand that every person no
12:42 - matter what skin tone they have they
12:44 - have different undertones so no matter
12:46 - your skin tone
12:47 - most folk are
12:49 - have either cool warm or neutral
12:52 - undertones so pretty much a white a
12:55 - warmish red or a foolish blue undertone
12:58 - and so we work with our photographers to
13:01 - find which colors are the best to
13:04 - include in the app and this is a uh
13:07 - a more beta version of the app
13:09 - especially i'm on ios um and so these
13:12 - colors are definitely still being
13:14 - finalized um but the feature is
13:17 - out for the most part on android
13:22 - very cool um
13:24 - bertrand one question we have from
13:27 - uh
13:29 - jonah criner in dover delaware is how it
13:31 - sounds like the project is still ongoing
13:33 - but how long have you been working on it
13:35 - and maybe how long do you see it going
13:37 - going going for
13:39 - yeah so we've been working on this
13:41 - project for
13:42 - almost two years now
13:44 - or a year and a half about a year and a
13:46 - half to two years it's been it's been a
13:48 - long uh
13:50 - a long blurry journey since 2020
13:53 - um but yeah and i foresee it so the
13:56 - camera is not going to be inclusive
13:58 - overnight um these are just the first
14:00 - features that we're working on and there
14:01 - are many many many more to come it's
14:03 - going to be a long uh longer journey of
14:06 - like honestly i feel as though we can be
14:09 - working on this for easily five years
14:11 - and still have more runway to go um
14:14 - because
14:15 - is
14:16 - it's a process um we're learning how to
14:19 - make that process more and more
14:20 - inclusive and build tools to be
14:22 - inclusive because just the field and
14:25 - area of product inclusion making
14:27 - inclusive product as a whole is very uh
14:31 - un uncharted territory for many
14:33 - companies and many people and so with
14:35 - inclusive camera we're one of the first
14:37 - who are going in and diving deep into
14:39 - building inclusive products and making
14:41 - sure that throughout the whole process
14:43 - there is a diverse group of people that
14:45 - are giving feedback and just uh
14:47 - throughout the whole process and working
14:49 - with the people who are experts and
14:50 - understand these spaces who aren't
14:53 - necessarily always in the tech companies
14:57 - yeah
14:58 - that's
14:59 - uh it's super cool to hear about that
15:01 - work that you all are doing there and um
15:05 - i think yeah some students and teachers
15:07 - who are listening might might kind of
15:09 - resonate with some of that that feedback
15:11 - process of building a feature getting
15:12 - feedback iterating on it working on one
15:14 - feature at a time and also this idea of
15:17 - kind of the empathy for the user and
15:18 - also thinking about who are the users
15:20 - right in an inclusive way um something
15:23 - that
15:24 - you know students who might be in cs
15:26 - discoveries as principals thinking about
15:28 - as they design their work and do their
15:29 - projects in their classrooms
15:31 - um
15:32 - speaking of you know things you might
15:34 - have learned along the way bertrand i'm
15:36 - curious what are some specific cs skills
15:39 - that you've learned that have helped you
15:40 - build the foundation for what you do
15:43 - with your work today
15:46 - yeah um honestly my cis skills uh very
15:49 - much brought me to where i am today
15:52 - so i before i was a product manager i
15:54 - was a software engineer on the camera
15:56 - team at snap and studied computer
15:58 - science in college uh so i have a degree
16:01 - from uh wentworth institute of
16:03 - technology in boston um in computer
16:05 - science and throughout that whole
16:07 - process uh what helped me is just
16:10 - understanding um the fundamentals of
16:13 - technology in general understanding how
16:15 - uh the camera works so i was helping
16:17 - build the
16:18 - foundations and the infrastructure for
16:21 - the camera on our team
16:23 - and i
16:24 - through that i'm really able to speak to
16:27 - our uh our engineering team
16:30 - as an engineer which they fully fully
16:32 - love
16:33 - because not all product managers have
16:35 - that much of an engineering background
16:37 - and so right now when there's when we're
16:39 - working on our computational photography
16:42 - algorithms and going deeper into
16:45 - like how though they work and even
16:46 - speaking about like whether we should or
16:48 - shouldn't use machine learning i'm able
16:50 - to uh
16:52 - speak really deeply with them and
16:54 - understand what they're talking about
16:55 - and vice versa um and so
16:57 - like my computer science background was
17:00 - great because like even on our
17:02 - on our product we are focusing on
17:04 - launching on android first and as an
17:06 - android developer beforehand i was able
17:08 - to understand like why it's so important
17:10 - to be launching on android um because
17:12 - the disparities and how many people are
17:14 - using android around the world compared
17:16 - to ios
17:19 - cool yeah yeah um
17:22 - that's cool to hear about that part of
17:23 - your journey and um
17:26 - bertrand just going back to the what you
17:27 - showed us kind of the demo um there's a
17:29 - question about
17:30 - can you explain a little bit more about
17:32 - this idea of undertones
17:36 - yeah um so
17:37 - at everyone's base level they have their
17:39 - skin tone that's what everybody sees um
17:42 - but every person has like different
17:43 - undertones in the sense of like what
17:46 - when you're taking pictures or wearing
17:48 - clothes what
17:49 - colors do you gravitate more towards or
17:51 - which ones do you realize that look
17:53 - better on you like if there's a backdrop
17:55 - or you're wearing like a blue shirt
17:57 - which one do you which one looks better
17:59 - um and so like under your
18:01 - uh
18:02 - under your skin essentially through your
18:04 - veins you can tell like what your
18:05 - undertones are i believe if your veins
18:07 - are like more bluish you have a cooler
18:09 - undertone if they're like uh more
18:11 - greenish you might have a warmer
18:13 - undertone there's honestly a website
18:15 - that helps you understand all your
18:16 - undertones i do not want to butcher it
18:18 - there um i believe i have cool
18:21 - undertones um and so uh like i look
18:24 - better with the blues um and so it this
18:27 - ranges so like within um black folk it
18:30 - ranges it's not like um black folk or
18:31 - darker skin folk all have blue
18:33 - undertones and lighters can folk all
18:34 - have warm undertones within each skin
18:36 - tone you can be either um and so yeah
18:40 - actually east african folk are more
18:42 - likely to have warm undertones and west
18:44 - african folk are more likely to have
18:46 - blue undertones and even though they're
18:48 - still
18:49 - both african and other similar tone
18:52 - ranges
18:53 - oh cool thanks for sharing about that
18:55 - and that made me think about something i
18:56 - think
18:57 - a quote for you in the video of this
18:59 - like yeah the image of or the vision of
19:02 - you know being able to be seen the way
19:04 - you want to be the way you are the way
19:05 - you want to be seen and so that makes me
19:07 - think about that um there's a question
19:09 - from from the audience about how will
19:11 - you the project account for
19:14 - the situation where there's several
19:15 - people in an image and they have
19:17 - different skin tones and different
19:19 - undertones how how is going to account
19:21 - for all of that
19:22 - absolutely and so that's one of the
19:24 - things where i say that this is going to
19:26 - be a long journey home so right now um
19:29 - we aren't accounting for that as much or
19:32 - um in the sense of just like we are
19:34 - focusing on the selfie camera because 90
19:36 - of the time it's a single person in the
19:38 - photo and so trying to get that uh
19:40 - working really well and then expanding
19:42 - that to multiple people because i want
19:44 - to be able to take the photos with my
19:45 - friends and my family at the same time
19:47 - the same way i know um everyone uh else
19:50 - on this call would want to as well um so
19:52 - that will be uh definitely to come
19:55 - cool cool
19:56 - well um
19:58 - you know bertrand you know part of your
20:00 - who you are is your work but we'd also
20:02 - love to know a little bit more about you
20:03 - outside of work so what do you enjoy
20:05 - doing outside of work
20:08 - um a few things so uh historically i
20:11 - used to wrestle um was uh but more
20:14 - recently i've been doing a lot of
20:17 - playing music singing and roller skating
20:20 - um so joined a lot of the roller skating
20:22 - craze that's happened in the past year
20:24 - two years
20:25 - very cool uh is this like roller skating
20:28 - for with like tricks or for speed or for
20:31 - like exercise like what is it what kind
20:33 - of started this exercise because i'm
20:35 - really i when i used to get a lot of my
20:37 - exercise from wrestling stop doing that
20:39 - um and don't like running so started
20:41 - with exercise um just for distance but
20:44 - then i started uh dance skating jam
20:46 - skating um and have been doing that ever
20:48 - since which that's pretty much all i do
20:50 - which is even more of in at least for me
20:53 - more of an exercise yeah i'm just roller
20:55 - skating on the beach yeah for sure i've
20:57 - seen i've seen people in groups doing it
20:59 - it looks very intense that's awesome um
21:02 - cool
21:02 - um
21:04 - well
21:06 - bertrand i wonder if we can kind of
21:08 - um i don't know maybe it's tied to your
21:10 - interest maybe maybe not but you know
21:12 - kind of even go back to
21:14 - um
21:15 - like yeah how did you how did you decide
21:17 - to get into this line of work kind of
21:19 - where where where did this interest in
21:22 - computer science um uh come from
21:25 - yeah um so i've always been involved in
21:29 - some level of technology um from when i
21:32 - was younger uh my brothers and i got
21:34 - into it from
21:36 - trying to
21:38 - figure out how to
21:40 - pretty much uh
21:42 - get video games um in a sense through
21:46 - the internet and whatnot um and so that
21:49 - was that helped me like figure out some
21:51 - level of it and actually was my me
21:53 - watching my brothers do it uh and then
21:55 - from there i played actually i'm a huge
21:57 - legend legend of zelda fan and played a
21:59 - ton of video games um but once i got
22:02 - into middle school i
22:04 - like
22:05 - had like a small
22:07 - uh a small instance with it there was
22:10 - like a
22:11 - test for
22:12 - a bunch of subjects and randomly i chose
22:14 - computers
22:15 - just because i was like oh i like
22:17 - computers um and i did pretty well in it
22:20 - but it wasn't until my last semester of
22:22 - high school that i
22:24 - uh took a computer science class with a
22:27 - haitian professor
22:29 - where i went to school in florida and it
22:31 - was completely on a whim
22:33 - i had a class with him my freshman year
22:34 - he was the best professor at the school
22:36 - and
22:38 - i promised him before i left i would
22:39 - take another class with him i had no
22:41 - idea what class that was like literally
22:43 - had no idea and it turned out to be a
22:45 - computer science class that was never
22:47 - ever actually coded um so like before
22:50 - that i was actually planning on studying
22:51 - law um and then i took that class and i
22:53 - switched my like what my plan was
22:55 - completely um then from there um i got
22:59 - into some programs that helped black and
23:01 - hispanic folk um college students into
23:04 - tech code 2040 uh and they were the ones
23:07 - who showed me that like there is a full
23:09 - intersection between our communities the
23:11 - black uh the black and hispanic
23:13 - community into
23:15 - into tech and like you can
23:18 - build your your keep your uh
23:21 - your
23:22 - values into what you build and so since
23:25 - then my values have always been to build
23:28 - dope stuff for dope people and with that
23:30 - increasing folks quality of life through
23:32 - technology and so um inclusive camera is
23:35 - one aspect of that and i can't wait
23:37 - until the
23:38 - future things that i build that are uh
23:40 - definitely going to be in that realm as
23:42 - well
23:43 - very cool i love that saying um another
23:46 - question from the audience kind of
23:48 - related to what you were just saying is
23:50 - what
23:51 - what maybe job internship opportunities
23:54 - did you take of advantage or even kind
23:55 - of projects did you work on
23:57 - um earlier to gain experience to then
24:00 - get to your current role
24:02 - yeah
24:03 - um i say this a ton to people uh because
24:07 - programming
24:09 - is amazing it's fun but sometimes it can
24:11 - be really boring like it can be
24:13 - especially when you're sitting and
24:14 - you're trying to figure out just some
24:16 - homework or something that like was
24:19 - uh just something and like it does it's
24:21 - not working and you want to have
24:22 - something to drive you to actually be
24:24 - doing it um
24:26 - and that's kind of what like pushed me
24:28 - the projects that i built so i figured
24:30 - out that or i wanted to build a music
24:33 - app because i did not want to be in
24:35 - charge of the aux cord um with my
24:38 - friends and like i just it was a whole i
24:40 - was always in charge of the oxford and i
24:41 - was like let me let me let me go to let
24:44 - me sit back and relax and somebody else
24:45 - play the music for once um and so i
24:48 - thought of like what does it look like
24:49 - to create an app where everybody is in
24:51 - charge of the aux cord um and i was
24:53 - building this throughout college and
24:55 - that's how i really really learned how
24:57 - to program because i was building
24:58 - something that i really wanted like
25:00 - something that i was passionate about um
25:02 - and so through that even though i tried
25:05 - failed tried failed and tried again um i
25:08 - was able to learn so much from that
25:10 - project and eventually it was able to to
25:13 - work um
25:15 - spotify then came out with a similar
25:17 - feature so i no longer need this project
25:18 - so that's okay um but uh it was able to
25:22 - work and uh
25:23 - got some used it as like my senior
25:25 - project even though like i started as
25:27 - like my freshman year as a passion
25:29 - project and eventually got some time
25:31 - even at school to work on it as part of
25:33 - my course too um and it really helped me
25:37 - shape what it looks like to
25:38 - uh to code actually and like the
25:41 - practical um the practicalities of
25:43 - programming but also what it looks like
25:45 - to build a product um i think that's
25:47 - some of my first product management
25:48 - experience as well in terms of like
25:50 - defining what the mvp is the most viable
25:52 - product essentially like the base
25:54 - features you need to get this um uh to
25:57 - get this out and go from there building
25:59 - those getting feedback from people
26:01 - showing it to people and doing the whole
26:03 - process
26:05 - yeah that example is uh
26:07 - super powerful and i think hopefully you
26:10 - know students teachers who are listening
26:11 - you know thinking about maybe like well
26:13 - should i try to build that thing that i
26:14 - want to even if
26:16 - you know maybe you don't know how but it
26:17 - sounds like probably when you started
26:18 - out you didn't know how you said you
26:20 - know you failed a lot of times and kept
26:22 - at it but like kind of having that
26:24 - vision in mind and
26:26 - um that product management piece that
26:28 - you mentioned there is probably helpful
26:29 - to have your friends give you feedback
26:31 - on you know whether it was working and
26:32 - obviously yourself were you able to
26:34 - relax uh
26:36 - and and not be in charge of the aux cord
26:38 - so some good feedback streams there for
26:40 - yourself
26:41 - um
26:44 - richard i'm curious
26:46 - if you could
26:47 - talk to us about what obstacles have you
26:50 - faced along your journey and and how
26:52 - have you approached them
26:55 - yeah i would say um
26:57 - honestly one of the major obstacles that
26:59 - i faced uh especially in
27:02 - the beginning of my career was like
27:04 - going from high school to college um
27:07 - i
27:08 - went to a
27:10 - uh i went to school in florida and my
27:12 - parents are really education is
27:14 - everything to haitians parents like
27:15 - everything um and
27:18 - but unfortunately due to circumstance i
27:21 - was didn't have enough scholarships to
27:22 - go to school without uh without taking
27:25 - out any loans and
27:27 - um definitely was not trying to take out
27:29 - any loans uh my parents weren't my
27:32 - parents weren't in favor of loans which
27:34 - i understand that um so i went to
27:37 - community college for a year and that
27:38 - was something that was like uh at least
27:41 - a big step back for me in terms of like
27:43 - not something i was expecting to do i
27:45 - was expecting you to go to state school
27:46 - like my siblings did um like so many of
27:49 - my friends did um all the florida
27:51 - schools fsu if you've ever heard of them
27:53 - they're like really popular schools that
27:55 - like so many of my friends went to um
27:57 - and but unfortunately i went to uh
28:00 - unfortunately at the time honestly it's
28:02 - the biggest blessing ever um that's the
28:04 - point of this um but unfortunately at
28:06 - the time i went to a community college
28:08 - um but i didn't let that like stop my
28:11 - career and so like i was able to
28:13 - um just keep at it be persistent and
28:17 - uh finish my like associates i had some
28:20 - uh some college credits from doing dual
28:22 - enrollment um and finished my associates
28:24 - in a year and it caused me to really be
28:28 - more tenacious and
28:30 - drive what like i really want and
28:32 - understand that like
28:34 - if i really want to be successful as a
28:36 - software engineer in computer science i
28:38 - need to like push and then eventually
28:41 - actually after i
28:42 - finished my
28:43 - my associates i transferred to a school
28:46 - in boston um
28:48 - ended up taking loans but it was
28:49 - definitely half the amount that i would
28:52 - have taken if if i stayed for four years
28:55 - and it's honestly the biggest blessing
28:56 - um because that's where i'm at code 2040
28:58 - and so a ton of other folks
29:01 - that's very cool to hear and uh
29:04 - appreciate you sharing about that your
29:05 - journey it's not always the uh the
29:07 - linear path that we might have in mind
29:09 - when we're when we're younger but it's
29:11 - obviously where you're at now is doing
29:13 - some super uh impactful and work and
29:17 - work that you're passionate about so um
29:19 - super cool to hear about that and um
29:21 - yeah but that's kind of the time that we
29:24 - have for today so return i want to just
29:26 - say thanks a lot for joining us uh for

29:42 - you can tune into the one more
29:45 - class chat we have later this spring and
29:47 - you can also look back at the past chats
29:49 - if you go to code.org cs journeys and
29:52 - teachers please check your email for a
29:55 - survey as we really appreciate the
29:56 - feedback about these calls
29:59 - as we think about future ones so again
