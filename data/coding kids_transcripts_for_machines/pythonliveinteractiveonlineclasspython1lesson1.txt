okay could you tell me about that what kind of things apart from games that you see on the web it's it's quite with programming needs let's make it languages to some programming robots here we can program robots robots wheelers programming it just metals what computers computers without any programming it just metals and do things they are smart or not do you think computers are smart depending on what type of computer it is and how um how much technology is built into it that's me somebody needs to coat them somebody needs to tell them how to performance the things that they need so we need to tell the computers how what we need to do and what kind of things we ask for them to do for us otherwise so the YouTube actually Microsoft where these kind of paintings Word Microsoft Word if you draw it down anything they actually somebody programming program and iPhone Android the phones that you use face food you don't have Facebook you might be have Xbox Xbox one this one is something that's start with exactly me they couldn't somebody caught them with the computer languages and that's why you can play okay I'm going to say you just give me moments and your link you can't don't go to the app but you're using Windows or Mac and Windows are you using Windows so tell me how's the weather over there Arabia now it's pretty hot well well depending since it's winter time it's the best time otherwise it's going to make it very very very hot you couldn't be I was living near Saudi Arabia Iran do you know you're on yeah yeah I was living there before came in us now I'm in Melbourne in Australia and it's going to be nice time actually afternoon right yeah it's actually it's eight so eight o clock is going to be good okay I'll send you a link again please I'm a true friend I you know in just the zoom zoom that you haven't let's see it's might be pop up for you is it it's not coming out and I think just have a look in the app if you see the inzone might be see something I can see that the bottom in the bottom it's going to be you will see a link trinkets that's IO okay okay just could you yeah I can tell you just I can't spell it and you can't drag it down in her own words what pros are using a star here Pro okay that's what have you seen a truck yes it's it's not a link it's just a name it's yeah if you click it or I just sent it it's not a trinket that yeah I can see that with it is that what was possibility income yeah if you click it or just copy and paste that in a browser yeah we will see the page okay I was greater okay oh that's what not and say let's me I say after that Titan writes down I'm going to send it again okay we have that website okay that's all we going to just have a look how these codes works it's just demonstrate we don't we're not gonna just understand it all now I need to do this I wanna see your teacher you can drag this up here to see what's she doing ready have you see using some quotes around but we don't need it oh you can't we have two parts yet just let me share my screen with you that you can see what exactly I'm talking about okay have you seen my screen now yes okay cool this part that if you see my cursor that's going around this part it's the part that we're going to write our codes here so some code that's might be some nonsense for you just delays it and we're not gonna see anything now just you're gonna start recording now the first thing I want to show you here we write our code and this space we're gonna see our result this is facing them right and so the first things could you do the things the same with me if you got just please clear out with the sherry screen in just side of your browser you can do those we can see my screen and you can see when you work on your browser as well okay if you need any help you can do something you can share your screen with me and I can see your screen and tell you what's going on I can get my own screen it's the same place that you find chat you will see share icon if you click the share icon in the bottom of the zone the screen yep if you click it you can just see what a very screen you will want to share with me the browser you working on yeah I think it's working yeah I can see okay cool yep I can okay oh yeah I can see yours your screen so you can just delete it you know this one day we're gonna see we kind of understand our codes that you can see here so can I do delete at all yeah you can delete it now because we want to start okay okay now could you just close your share button on the top of this screen and the top of you will see the stop up here yeah so a present yes oh cool yeah because uh I wanna share my screen we couldn't do it together okay cool the first thing that I'm going to do just type print we're gonna write down something here in write the space that it's empty now yours there's still some things in your screen because it remains from the last codes okay here I'm going to say print hello and then when I write it down how can I found out how to show in this thing it's when to rightclick them to run this sign here and you will see it show me saying hello so so how we can do it by saying print and then open the brown bracket and then what else here we have quotation double quotation once does another and then we're gonna say whatever we like to print out here you said it just hello you can say do you want me do you want to write down what you really like just talk okay so should I share the screen but if you everything's going well that's fine each other I cannot share the screen you couldn't do it now because I'll share my screen if do you have any problem with that or you did you did the same with me like me have you have you done it no okay have you write down okay have you synched this is screen that's just write down print hello Stefan and here show you you click the run let me show you here the result okay if you need to share your screen I'm going to stop my screen and then you can share it now you can I can see you forgot small things you forgot to take that we need everything that we're gonna print it out it should be inside or in a bracket in um quotation double quotation or quotation so you should put hello as the pan in a quotation sign yeah true now it's like you can put there put the result up like just dragon yeah could you see this small oh yeah cool yeah it's done then we are going suck could I share my screen the next step is to say something else like we can say eight plus eight we can print eight plus eight is it true they're resolved yes we can so we can do math Poynter we can just calculate whatever we ain't here without opening the calculator so easy what's cool what do you like to calculate down what's tell me a big number three quadrillion times on fifteen or million okay write it down and see the result I need you on exit so I can do it so I knew you don't need to share with me okay just add okay just three thousand times on five thousand yeah that's fine but just you can do it whatever you think you say you can just write it down just you need to put the print and then bracket open bracket and then three thousand multiple by whatever five thousand let's see fifteen thousand and I know fifteen oh yeah we can do it more complicated numbers like that for man this one is should be yeah it should be bigger so we can say that's funny okay next why do you like to know more so next one we're going to if we kind of just use lots of numbers and you know if we need to know this result to put it somewhere so just think about we're gonna use 707 7707 or just say say the small number let's just do small number 16 minus 5 it's 8 so we gotta use this state we're gonna say the result of this calculation is going to be say 8 what's 8 plus 8 or 9 what is point 9 so we're gonna use the result of this calculation here how we can keep it you think we need to store it so how we store this I will store this result of the first calculation we gotta use variable we say variable that's variable something like if box we have a box let me show do you have my myface video or yes okay cool so we have a box that we're gonna put just think about you're gonna put your toys in your box to a store it and put it in just the corner of your room to just for later let's say do you just want to put just your Legos okay how how we can do it and then we can store it for one day and then use it tomorrow so how we can do it in here with numbers it's this that we use the box that we're gonna say what's the box is say let's put a name on the box your name is okay we can say it steppin steppin box it's equal to 13 minus 5 so what's could be step on box inside well entre 39 5 is 8 yeah yeah so 8 we put the age number this number in the box not here easy and then if we print it out here what we're gonna see is we can see we can say it's the box we have to we have to see it yeah we can see 8 number so what we did here we just store these numbers the calculator of these numbers in the box that we cover this different box and so then we can use it how we can use we can say box it should be the same name that we use you know this this language it's is actually very sensitive that means if I use if I say for example print box like this what do you think it's show me nothing you know what because there is some difference here could you tell me what's different capital yeah exactly so whatever we said if we said SVS capital would be upper case the same we have to use when we were gonna use the box it shouldn't be different the same thing would you learn to write down what's a really large store some numbers that you like in the name you rock now you know what hey I got it bad so what's next mr. Chang half your time maybe you remember how how we form a new variable we say we say a name equal yeah yeah yeah that's correct equal we don't need the parentheses we don't need yeah we just need it for print you no because because we just put it in the box we didn't tell Python to prepare for us it's the stupid we should tell them otherwise it doesn't understand words what do you say oh yeah just this good excellent so we have your that's a very well we have so we gotta use that's your right but what do you want to use it you can't calculate you can use it you can't you know add a number okay good yeah just just play with it that's fine just try whatever you like we could even tell how it's a big number cool we have a counselor cool yay very interesting hey infinite number uh let's do something with our variable let's use it we can you can add more number in your variable that you put to the names and dinosaur box you can add more number blocks like for example put some more number on the box how you can't do it you think could you give me I will show you back to my box I want to put some number I'm gonna say barks let's keep this one box the same that we have and then add a big number watch it number so we have this and see what we have before please do you have me did you see any rows no okay now I'm gonna say print out what we have now in our box what we have here what you thinking show us doesn't show us anything okay we're gonna just still a sorry I miss ya okay I share my screen again so what I've done right here could you cook him hello yes so what we have done here you see my screen yeah so what we have what I've done that it's just add a big number in my box that my mother and say put it add it to the box just this number add to this box and then print it out it show me this number that is true just add so oh yeah we had 17 and add more number you can do it with your you got a son of seventeen and then on then you just added on the Stepan dogs with them with that number but Stefan box is equivalent to seventeen so you got and now I've got eighty two thousand three hundred seven yeah that's a I add more number I had lots of number and the box just like that oh I can't multiple whatever you lie again let's let's do multiple and but I need you write down again I need to write the balance sorry I just keep it this and then going to write it down say it Stefan torques equal multiple let's say Towson and then paint hey hey Parton print me second box tell me how much I have you know doesn't Shh show me show me please okay I need to get some lines okay it show me the number that I see so I have a big number in my box now how about you how much you have it froze up again do you have me yeah okay have you seen what I have dumped in there so I I multiple with thousand I did show me this big number what do you want to do with your number with your variable yeah when I put some more numbers okay let's do it are we gonna add more number or what we're going to use the same things that we have before oh no no you forgot to pay it is a bit different you need to keep the name that we have you need to keep the box so we have the box and they say okay the number that we have before calculates a door multiple with a new number this one is not you need to have a look in my train let me III put okay right down I'm going to write down for you that's what's the difference that we have here could you see my chat my kicks that I sent to you don't say there's nothing on you have a look go to the bottom of your screen button and you will see chat icon the same place that you see share icon you see chat there's no check here's no chat box if you go to the bottom of your zone just open your zoom screen and you will see I think your Dalek on the chat box the chat box have you seen here you know what's the problem is it find it if you go into the bottom of the earth zone scream you will say chat icon hey I found it okay so what I typed actually it's different things that you have done so I say dinosaur box equal to the dinosaur box that we have it before multiple the number that you put so that's the difference yeah how's work so do I have to put up a different name over here well it's not different and then dinosaur box times this amount because danger yeah yeah what's not a different names it's the same name okay III write it down different name sorry yeah it's my typo so you say diner the same that you put no that's it means the same it's all the same so guys your box yeah Dino stop rocks that he use equals equals yeah Dino soapbox okay times times yeah could you write it down I can see you're asking because just for the trans mm so dancer box equals dinosaur box times to me maybe to something yeah it's okay doesn't matter two million so it's 2 milli 2200 minute oh yeah go to the next line okay yes and writes down dinosaur parks equals yes okay well I couldn't see your screen I couldn't see anything here oh it's have you type it no I cut guys your box equals because I couldn't see anything you type I okay cookie you give me permission to can share my screen if you just close your eyes can share I can't share much or maybe I can let's say so what we gonna do you see now I use a small number in a step and box so I say it ii barks equal simple parts and multiple mm I can use another certainty another way it's like that is the pun but it's clicked me write it down here it's better slip on the box I can say just multiple loss okay could you see great yeah so what I've done you'd say that's these two is the same we can do if you again use the different way of variable you see are you I said it's the pin box it's multiple equal thousand so this two lines is doing the same weight I think this one is more easy for you you like the other one yeah yeah you can do it the same and you can see the result it's gonna be the same I'm gonna print it out say seven works it's more number because I add more thousand to the box so would you like to do it in the same we knew today with your dragon box you can share yours you can see the bottom you say syntax error bad input on line seven line seven is not correct because you put something more than usual you put equal sign at the end that we don't need it yeah yeah now it's going to pull and now we have another one we have another error in line eight do you know you should put them go first and then plus and then equal so say oh good just put multiple sign before equal sign okay here exactly now ronette see this might be okay so no I wrote no a role but we couldn't see anything here because we didn't tell please print it for us we didn't tell them we didn't ask Titan to print it for us so what we're gonna do it yeah now next time we're gonna next line you shouldn't put we have a variable yep we have to do it in a separate line after we did we done all the calculation we gonna do the print it's okay use controls it if it's working yeah that's work but you need to delete again print just do the slowly okay yeah now how we can see the result we print okay fine what oh yeah you had lots of a big number cool you can it do you want to just delete or take away from your Park some numbers take away some of those just put put out something some numbers from your box you can do write it down again yeah in line 10 and start to write yes yeah it's just go and put away some of the numbers from your box how you can do it you think could you show me how you can add 1 & 2 I'll subtract how to minus some number from your box donor supports or add and then print no no so the things that have a look what you have done before you just the same syntax yeah equal guide dinosaur dog but dinosaur box should be in your left side so but it printed out see if it's problem no it's okay do you have a check I've checked with the other lines that you have done so what's the difference between know when you multiple and when you actually and that's it yep yes yeah that's true good job I do want to continue to maybe write down add some numbers or get some sudden some numbers in your dinosaur box can really get poverty and anything new one yeah yeah sure why not make the new works oh no it's okay you know the rule behind the rules to define an name of the variable so the name of variable is casesensitive but it shouldn't be oh yes it shouldn't make any space between yeah exactly yeah yeah that's that's true now but we couldn't see anything here because I'm questioning no it doesn't because we didn't ask it to answer the question we just put it in a box we didn't show it yeah exactly I like the name it's the pawn diamond willpower cool great name what you want to do with this new one are they so you know what's happened what you just you just put that's number the first number that you put in a steppin diamond wheelbarrow and then say to add something but you didn't put it inside the box you didn't put in you know you just added you just equal plus it go that's it Oh excellent great job so I think yeah you've done very good job except that you have a nice names for rival I like it okay the next so we're going to write down whatever you like yay [Laughter] their session that's you learn how to print whatever you like exactly and that is look like the boxes that we put lots of number into your boxes and yeah we we don't for now and you don't for now you did a very good job the next session I'm not sure when is it but we're gonna check to get there I'm gonna check and we go on with to learning more things about Titan okay can I print something as well yes I guess did they give me permission let's say what is that this one should be in the same line that's a good to know good job great so practice with these things that you learn for the next session we're gonna die or more we're gonna know more things about how to print lots of things to know she's just beginning can I have a chat with daddy okay okay cool yeah yeah very nice okay a Python book that you would recommend to he could read for some additional learning we're gonna continue with hey my team or how many sessions don't you're going to we're guys we're gonna start with a but we
