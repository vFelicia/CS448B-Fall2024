welcome to coding kids today I'm going to show you how to build cat and fish a basic scratch game first let's look at how we play it the player controls the cat by pressing the left right up and down arrow keys to make the cat move around the screen the aim of the game is to touch the fish to make it say hello this is the end of the game and who you touch the fish the game will continue now let's build the game there are four steps to the game 1 the backdrop to the cat 3 the fish and for the end where the fish saves hello let's build the game step by step first let's start with a brand new project by clicking on the create button on the home page as you can see a new project starts for the cat as the default sprite a sprite is the character or object that we use in our computer program for step 1 let's add the backdrop by clicking on the backdrop icon at the bottom left of the screen this opens the backdrop library scroll through the backdrop library until you find a backdrop spurts you like you may choose to use a different backdrop to me doubleclick on the backdrop you have selected or click on the backdrop then click the ok button to use it in your game 4 sep two let's program the cat to close our cats right first we need to select the cat sprite and then open the scripts tab at the top center to activate the cat when we press the arrow keys we will need for event blocks in the event plot category we can find a block that phase when space key pressed let's drag four of these blocks into the workspace now click on the drop down arrow to change the key from space to left right up and down arrow for each of these event logs now we need to add motion blocks to these events we know that to move up and down we use the y axis and to move left and right we use the x axis to make the cat's move up with the up arrow we need to choose a block that phase change y by 10 in the motion category we can increase the number 215 to make the cat's bright move quicker now we can connect it to the blocks that phase when up arrow key press to activate it to make the cat moves down we need to do the same except instead of change wide by 15 we need to put in change y x minus 15 then we connect it to the block that phase when down arrow key pressed to make the cat's move right we repeat the same process as before however it is important to remember that left and right are on the xaxis not the y axis we dragged in change X by 10 and increase the number to increase speed then we connect it to the block that saved when right arrow key pressed to activate it to make the cat moves left we repeat our earlier steps making sure to use a negative change x x value instead of a positive one to ensure it goes to the left then we connect it to the blocks that phase when left arrow key pressed now let's test our clothes I'll press the right arrow key now the left arrow key the up arrow key and the down arrow key our cat sprite is moving correctly now let's go to step 3 to make the fish move randomly round the screen currently we only have one sprite in our game so we need to select a new sprite from the sprite library i'll choose the fish bright I want the fish to start moving at the top right corner of the screen when the green flag is pressed to close our fish sprite we need an event block in the event category we can find the when green flag clicked block and the goto exposition yposition block under the motion category places together and change the x position to minus 200 and the y position to 150 that is the top right corner of the screen let's test this I'll place the fish away from this location and then press the green flag when I click on the green flag it moves the top right corner our code works now select move 10 steps under motion and change its number 220 to make our fish easier to catch we can use our weight one sex block which can be found under the control category to make it move faster decrease the number tumult point2 now we want the fish to move around forever let's grab her forever block which can be found in the control category hover the forever block over the move to and glide blocks so that it looks like the forever block is about to eat the four blocks then let go the forever block should have the move to new and glide blocks inside it now let's run the script for the fish you can see that when it hits the edge of the screen it stops to continue moving and to bounce off the edges of the screen use a block that phase if on edge bounce found under the motion category now let's click on the green flag and see what happens see how the fish now bounces off the edges of the screen now we want to make the fish moves around randomly to do this we need to combine two blocks one of them is the pick random one to 10 block under operators and change its numbers to minus five and five the other block is turn right 15 degrees I put my random number block to replace the number 15 now place these combined blocks between the weight block and bounce block to get the fish to term in different directions from minus 5 degrees to plus 5 degrees that is the fish turns randomly to the left or to the right it works the fish is now moving randomly across the screen you can see that when the fish and cat touch nothing happens so now we need to code the final step in our game first let's click on the fish what we want to happen is when the cat touches the fish the fish says hello cat and the scripts stop running we do this by getting an if block and a touching block put the touching block into the gap in the if block then click on the dropdown menu and select sprite one so now the code says if touching sprite one then when this happens we want to make our fish bright say hello and stop the script we go into the looks category and get there say hello for two seconds blog type in and add the word cat after the hello takes then go to controls and get the stop all block to stop the scripts after saying hello we actually want to check if the cat is touching the fish all the time we can do this by using a forever loop so let's put all of this in a forever block which we can find in the control category let's click on the green flag yeah it works now I want to do the same thing for the cat so let's select and drag the script that we've recently created and drag it to the sprite one now if you go to the cat scripts you can see we have the same script for the cat change hello cat to hello fish now let's click on the green flag to test our game great it works add your own features to personalize the game perhaps at a timer to play the game with a limited time or change backdrops and add sounds to this game
