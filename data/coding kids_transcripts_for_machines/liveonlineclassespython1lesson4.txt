okay and we're gonna stop sharing my screen now so let me know and you can see it can you see my screen David I know not yet oh yes yep so you can see like a little turtle and stuff yep yep okay cool so this is the project we'll be making this lesson today so we'll make it on our own computers this is on trinket but what it is is it's an interest it's called interactive turtle so we can control where we draw the line so for example down here it's asking us how far will Bob walk so we can put in a number like a hundred maybe and then it drew a line and now we can tell it how many degrees two tens I might say 90 and then you can keep going and then you can make whatever shapes you want yeah okay and yeah so that's just me typing it's I can even like turn a random amount of degrees like 48 and then like walk 30 so if you don't have to make neat chase but it's just an interactive turtle where it takes what you typed in and draws it yeah and how do you and how do you do it yes so that's what we're gonna do this lesson oh yeah yeah I'll go through it stepbystep so make sure to get Idol open so let me know when you have Idol open yeah our I'm Reggie I'm having a vehicle and then what we want to do is we want to make a new file so do you mind yeah I did try yep okay cool file new file so I'll quickly do that now before we start I'll just close that if we go back to our project what so will you need to break it down so that it's easy for us to code so what are the different steps that happen so just like when you're talking like what do you see what odds like different things that's happening with this program so what's one thing that's happening so as soon as you press like play what's the first thing it asks you how far road yet wait I didn't get a turn at all he gets I know we haven't started anything yet so I'm just fixing we're just but we're looking at the project and we're just trying to break it down so that it's easy for us to start coding it oh yeah okay sure how far will yeah yeah so then that's one step and then we can put in a number so just 30 and then what's another step that's happening how many degrees should Bob turn yep and then again we put in another number and then it turns and then what happens again like does it just finish or is it continuing its continued yep exactly so you can just keep continuing typing stuff so it keeps going how far will it work and how many degrees so some of the basic steps are when we start we like set up our turtle then it asks us for some input so how far will Bob work and then it works that far and then it asks us for the degrees how many degrees sit down and then it turns and then it keeps repeating that so I'll get my file open again so do you remember the first thing you need to type when you're making a turtle project or when you need to use turtle yeah import turtle yep good job so remember import turtle with the lowercase T and then we need to set up our actual turtle like the thing that's moving around do you remember how to do that as well okay not really that's okay so it's a bit like a variable because we want to give our turtle a name so I might call mine Bob you can call us whatever you want I'm gonna say Bob and because it's a variable we can say equals and we want to make Bob into a turtle but to do that you say yeah hmm what can i type someone's name yeah you can type another name that's fine okay Chester can you hear me okay so David you go turtle dot and then you type your turtle with a capital T and you have your two brackets so do you remember why we do that okay so the first thing importing turtle is because turtle is a library from somewhere else so that's like some code that someone else has written and we're using it so to be able to use it we have to actually import it and now to actually like create a turtle object we give it a name and we say equals a turtle so we go lower case turtle dot because that's saying it's from this turtle library you're saying okay turtle dot and then turtle with a capital T that that function means it's taking the total yeah okay yeah because that makes them kinda yeah yeah okay so what you can do now is you can do you remember how we change the shape of the turtle last week know everything from the last lesson is kind of unclear to me Oh unclear okay this yeah okay well this is this will be a good revision then for you so we want to change the shape of the turtle to be like a little turtle shape like you see in the project I showed you so to do that we gave our turtle the name so my ones called Bob so I'm going to go Bob dot shape and then brecht it inside the record of quotation mark and I want it to be the shape of a turtle so T you are TLE and then close the quotation mark and close the bracket yep so what I'm doing right now okay cool so what that does is we have to go Bob dot something so that it knows we're changing the shape of our turtles that we need and then we put the word turtle in quotation marks because it's a string so string is like a word yeah I'm done yep you're done okay so I'll get you to run it first now and just yeah okay and choose remember we would save it first yeah so when you press run it will ask you to save it sorry ash is choose where to save Chester can you hear me justic so remember how you made that folder last week uh just uh can you hear me hi so there is this is a turtle so this is called interactive turtle yeah so I just surge or just close a tough Todd looked at it yep so did it draw the little turtle yeah yep okay cool yeah now you just close it so chest up we're making a project called interactive turtle so it's like the one that I showed you in and oh yeah I can hear you can you hear me yep okay yeah so we're making a project we just started a project called interactive turtle and it's like what we start on what I showed you in the first week so if you can you see my screen yep so it's this thing so it asks how far will Bob walk and you can say a number and I didn't press play you can say a number and then it asks how far will Bob turn and you can say another number and then you can keep going so you can draw your own shapes hang them so we just started if you can see my screen and just quickly try and in those first three lines so we just created our turtle those are the first three steps oh yeah yes so in a new file mmhmm yep and David while you're waiting what we can do is we can change the color of our pen if we want how do you do John yep so it's just the same as like how we change the shape so we have to go bob dot bob dot but instead we can type in color the oh so you have to spell it the American Way because that's just how Python does it and then you can put in a color so I might want to change mine to green so you need the brackets and then the quotation marks again and inside that you type the word green or whatever color you want to change it to so python just like with the shape python like turtle has a few set shapes and set colors that you can use so sometimes it might not have every single color or every single shape like if you wanted a shape of a stapler or something it might not have that shape so you have to if you want to see what shapes or colors they have you can just google they can type in python turtle and then if we want to see what colors are we can type in color colors yeah I want to see no Konishi the shape the shape kind of change it to I'm so you could triangle yeah so you can try that but I'll let you also go on like on to Google and so I'll shut up just so you can see it for yourself okay now run it that one okay it says I can change it to that shape so there's no rectangle there's no rectangle yeah what is what did it say that it said like mm unable to get sad shape okay so yeah I'll let you go onto Google quickly and try look for it so type in something like turtle shape and it should be that first result so Chester how are you going with you oh yes it didn't it didn't I have a yeah I have a purple triangle okay cool nice did what use yep like those three lines and then I was just showing David how to change the shape and color of the turtle while we're waiting but I'll move on to the next step now does everything so far make sense to you guys yeah interactive so we're that's what we're making right now so we have to I I was explaining to David so we have to break it up into steps so the first step like we created our turtle now David do you remember the next step no no yeah I didn't remember anything from the last lesson so I'm gonna just it's not from last lesson what I was saying at the beginning but that's okay so if I open up the project we've created our turtle and now what it does is it asks us how far will bubble so that's what we need to do now we need to get it to ask us how far will bubble okay so how do we do jack yeah so that's what mix they know so before doing that so do you remember how in this project you can just keep typing stuff it's just continuous so it keeps going on forever it's doing that because we in something called a loop so if you remember we did something called some using for loops last lesson if you don't that's okay but do you remember the term Luke's David or Cheston now I remember I was trying to practice it you forgot had a carrot okay that's okay we're doing a different kind of look today but the loop we're doing today is called a while loop so what a while loop does is you can continue doing something until a certain condition is met so when we did a full lips last week we could just repeat something a certain number of times so last week we need for loops and like for example when we're drawing our square we wanted to repeat it four times so we use that thing called range but this week we want to repeat something to keep going forever so what we need to type is the word while so type in the word while because we're using a while loop yep and then the word true with a capital T so T Yui did it give it okay cool so Chester did you do that as well did you type in the word while and true thank you so type okay so the reason why we say the word true is because yeah you got it okay cool so the reason the word true here with a capital T is something called a boolean so it pretty much means something is true and because we're using a while loop that kind of takes some sort of condition to keep repeating something the condition we said here was true so like true is always going to be true so that means a like it's just gonna keep happening forever because that kind of makes it yeah okay okay so now if you remember from last week when we did loops we have to use indentation and we also have to use the semicolon so we type in while true and then the semicolon or the sorry and then if you press ENTER it should be the next line you write should be a bit engine turning yeah yep so that's good we want it to be indented so that our code knows anything that's indented is part of that loop such as don't cut that is up yeah yep okay so now what we want to do so we have our loop set up now we actually want to ask the user question so do you remember you might not if you're doing but do you remember how you get an input like you asked the person a question like do you remember how you get a value from on Python by asking the user question so I think we did it in the first lesson where we asked what is your name the first or second lesson does anyone remember no that's okay so we use something called input so if you type in the word inpu T so input is a bit like print but crane just writes down like a sentence or whatever word you say on the screen this writes down a sentence and then waits like it there's a space so that someone can type something afterwards so we want to say input how will Bob travel oh whatever you called you turtle so that's the first question our program asks us because if you remember in the example and it said how far will Bob travel so remember to type in input and then have brackets and then inside the brackets quotations quotation marks that say with the work with the phrase saying how far will Bob travel and then close them does everyone have that I'm just I'm just typing ok that's me also you don't have to use this exact phrase you can say something else just as long as it makes sense that you're asking how far will your turtle trouble so David do you have that line of call mmm yep just finished it yep ok cool you finish it okay so now I'll just get everyone to run what they have so far just to test what happens and if it works like way we expect it to so we want it to ask us how far will Bob or whatever name you gave your turtle trouble so it will ask the question in the Python shell and then you should still be able to just see the turtle there but it shouldn't do anything yet and then if you type something after the how file will bub trouble if you just type in anything it will just keep asking you the question because we put in a loop it will keep asking it from us forever to everyone test it and see if that works for you guys yep mmm there's ting it and finally we'll try one sails and no one Oh what she doesn't enter so Bob shouldn't move yet Oh your turtle won't move yet because we have encoded it to do that but if you just go into shell and where the question is you can keep answering a question yeah and yeah does it move I don't see moving because we have an ad of the code to make it move yet so oh yeah yeah I just registered and dowon's a thousand yeah so if you press enter it should ask you again so just press ENTER and see if it asked you again how did you just type me yes so you can type in letters as well because it doesn't know what like it doesn't know what it's expecting us to type in yeah yeah as long as it just keeps asking you the question as you press Enter you know that it's working you know that our while loop is working so that means it will do it forever so does everyone have that working yeah yep and does it so what did you say Jess all right yeah it works too if you just press ENTER yep so does that make sense how the while loop and the question is roughing the input thing yep David does that make sense you as well yeah yep okay so we'll go back so we'll close the show and then we'll go back to our program so what we want to do is we ask the person how far we want Bob to travel so Chester do you say something did you have a question nope okay so yeah what we did is we asked our user whoever's running our program how far we want Bob to travel but we actually want to be use whatever value they gave us to make our Bob or one of our turtle is move so we need to save this answer somewhere because if we just ask them we've asked them but we're not saving the value anywhere so our program won't remember what number we typed in so who remembers a way of how we can save values in something so anyone know if you remember how I explained something is like a little box that remembers a value what is that it's cold do you guys remember what variables are yeah so what's a variable so variable is something where you can go at something equals something but what we use variables for is to remember stuff or like to store values in something so for example in a game you might have a variable called score and you say score is equal to zero and then later on in that game you can change the school so in our case we want to save Paden are you learned that last year yes okay that's cool yes so what we want to do is we want to make a variable that remembers the distance that somebody typed in because in this program it asks how far will Bob walk so we need to remember that value so that we can use it later to actually make Bob walk so to do that we can type in the word distance so D is da equals so type that in before input so what that is doing is distance is the name of our variable and we're saying distance equals whatever our person typed in after this question so David does that make sense to you yep yep okay so you can use any word it doesn't have to be distance but you need to use something meaningful so something you know what I usually just yeah usually makes sense because we want to use it to say how far our total will look but you could use like steps or something like that as well but I'm just gonna stick with distance for now so does everyone have that yep yep just like it doing it okay cool and just remember with this input thing whatever the user types in afterwards will be saved as a string so what we're doing is we're saving whatever they typed after this question into a variable called distance as a string so once you've typed that just press ENTER so you're on the like next line but make sure you're still indented in because now we actually want to use that number or that value distance to make our turtle move so we just want to make it go forward however many times like whatever number the user typed in times so how might we do that does anyone have an idea I know I think yeah how far will Bob how long will Bob move or or something like that so before Bob does me before asking a question we actually want to make Bob move forward like however many times the person said it so if you look on my screen in the example program again it asks how far will Bob walk so that's the first step that we did that's the input thing and then once you type in a number so if I type in 50 it actually moves so that's the next step we're trying to do now so we ask the user how far will Bob walk and now we've saved whatever they type in in something called a variable which is called distance and now we want to actually make our turtle move so how do we make something move in Turtles if we just want to go forward what do we type in yep exactly so we'll go Bob duck forward just so that we know a moving Bob forward but inside the brackets we have to put in a number or we have to put in a value so what value do we put in does anyone know I think annually any value so the value we want is whatever the person typed in or oh yeah sure hard in abuja so do you have an idea so we saved whatever the person typed in there something called distance so what do you think we'll put inside the brackets sorry just I didn't hear you what do you think yep exactly so we put in the word distance inside the brackets so what that's saying is we want Bob to move forward this much time so distance time and distance is whatever we typed in so I'll get you guys to run it and see what happens but you might get an error and I'll explain it to you after but I just want you to run it first to see what happens yep run and then when it asks you how far will Bob travel just put in a number I'm just okay so I got an error and you guys should get an error too and if you will not if you don't get an error then it might be surprising oh yeah I have another yes so it's meant to give you an error because we explained it to you after we forgot to do something suppress the did you run yours and see as well yeah yep do you get an error as well whoa oh it just gave you an arrow straight away okay um you might have something in your code before that that causes an error but I'll first explain this error and then when I go back to my code you can see if yours looks like mine there might just be something wait it might be something when you did like distance equals that but the error we're getting here if you look on my screen is it's saying well it's a big error but it's pretty much saying can't multiply sequence by non int of type float that's a bit confusing but what in this case what it's saying is because it's telling us the error is in Lion ten where it says Bob dot for a distance if we go back into our code you remember how I said just a few minutes of the input saves whatever the user typed in as a string yep yep but in this function here where we say Bob dot for a distance we want it's expecting a number because it's expecting us to put in a number like 10 or 20 or something like that so even though we in our program even though we typed in a number in the background like it saved it as a string so instead of saving it as the number 80 when I type in 80 it's saved as 80 in quotation marks so what we need to do is we need to actually convert this so we need to convert the variable distance into an integer so an integer is a number an integer so do an integer is just another word for a number in programming languages so to convert it you just type in the word I and in front of the word distance in your Bob go forward thing yep and then you put brackets around the word distance so just check that yours looks like my code so the words are the letters int is short for integer yeah so it pretty much is just saying to convert distance that's a string into an integer and then did it work for you Chester yeah yeah okay so yeah David run yours as well run what did you say Chester sorry Connie yep so type in a number now and see what happens now your turtle should move hopefully hey yes it did it did cool Chester did yours move no no did you get an error what does your arrow say so did it look like the one I had before yeah yeah I got are not slow so in your code do you have this bit where you convert it to an insert int distance and balance so I didn't hear gesture did you okay so just add that in now so the int and then in brackets distance is just converting that variable which right now is a string into a number so like if you type in a number in the background it will just change it to an actual number value in our code so that this Bob dot forward function can actually work yep I think so once you save it like in the first the first time it saves it automatically and because we have it in our while loop so David as well because you have yours in a while loop you can keep doing lines so like every time it asks you you can just type in like one and then it can move like ten and you keep drawing lines so as everyone's working it yep okay that's pretty cool right and then you can just say how much how far we'll go so now we'll do the next step which is actually making it turn so what's the first thing we need to make it turn so it's almost like what we did up here but instead if you look at the example project it says something else it says how many degree should Bob done so how do we type that bit of coding can someone tell me so before I know right before yeah nothing so yes but instead we want to make a new variable so distance is what we use like for the question how far will Bob travel but we want to make a new variable so that we know how like Bob will turn so what we could call it is something like angle equals so we're making a new variable now that remembers the angle that somebody typed in so what do I need to type in next angle yep exactly input and then sorry what do you say yeah or turn but yep so you can type in something like what angle lil bub so David did you get all that as well I'm trying right now you're trying right now okay so what it's doing is it's pretty much the same thing as what we typed before but it's just asking different question and saving it in a different variable name you got that so I got it you got it okay so now we actually want to use this variable to make our turtle turn to make Bob turn so what does anyone know what line of code we might use well the beginning of the line so yep yep so we go Bob dot and then we can type in left so that we're turning to the left so many degrees and then what do we need to type inside the brackets yep exactly so we need to do the same thing we did with forward by first changing it to an integer so int and then we need brackets again and inside the second set of brackets we want to type in the word angle so what we're telling our program is for bub to turn so many degrees based on whatever we typed in first and we write the word int to convert what we typed in to a number yep yep does that make sense yes yep yes if you have a question you know or if it doesn't make complete sense let me know but if it's all okay we can run yep run module and then see what happens so you should be able to now continuously say how far to walk and what angle to turn okay half I will book traveled 10 what angle what angle I have an error you have an error what's the error they trace back my street and call last file see you should fly up data located module Bob left angle mmhmm yes all exact does it say like invalid literal or something for base it says invalid yep so I think what you might have done is what was the last thing you typed in was it a number was it a letter oh it was a letter it was a letter yes so that's what the error is because it's trying to convert whatever we typed in so it's trying to convert like the letter you type in into a number but the program can't convert like the letter A into a number like it can convert a in quotation marks into a number like before when you type it like if you typed in 50 it can convert 50 from quotation marks into a number but because it's a letter it can't do that because yeah so we can actually add something in our program to check if what the person typed in was a literal number do you guys want to do that because we have 10 minutes left so we can check like it's whatever somebody typed in was actually a number so do you guys want to do that oh yeah yes okay what did you say chess si looks like a golf club that's funny okay so what we want to do is we want to check whatever the person typed in is a number so in Python there is a way to do that let me try find it or we can put a limit on actually no let me try find it so check give me a second okay so do you remember how I was talking about if I think we used it some things called if statements we use it a couple of lessons ago so we can use if statements to check if something is true or false and if it is then we can do something inside that if statement so what we want to do is we want to check if whatever they typed in is a number if it is will make Bob go forward and if it's not we'll give them an error message so let me just get the code up okay so this is a bit different so there's something called let me should I find an easier way to do it without confusing you guys what we can say is there's something called pass in I'm pretty sure so let me just let me get it up so that I know exactly what to show you cuz in Python you have to check if it is a number and if it isn't you want to do something else so let me get it otherwise what you can do is I'll do it this way okay I'll show you guys so there's something called if statements where you can check if something is true we want to do something else but in Python there's also something called trycatch statements so what trycatch statements do is they're a bit like if statements so you tell it to try a bit of code and the catch thing is if there's an error you want to do something else or you want to say something else so I'll type it in for you so we got to type in the word try and then do the colon and press Enter so you want to say try and we want to try make Bob Bob go forward so I'm just gonna cut like take this out of here and put it in the try thing so I just press ctrl X on my keyboard to cut it and I pasted it in here to let me know when you have done that step yeah yep you've done that cool so that step is first saying okay after we've asked them for the input and saved it we want to try and make Bob go forward that's that step and then the next thing we want to say is so instead of cat we're gonna say except instead the except type in the word except and we want to say value error actually before that I'm just gonna quickly find out so what we're saying here what we need to find out is what type of error our code will get if we don't type in a word so just look on my screen for the minute I'm just come home minding sound stuff out just to test something I just want to see what type of error it will tell me so if I press thanks okay yep so it says do you see how if everyone's looking my screen it asks me how far will Bob travel and I just typed in space and press enter and then I got something called a value error because it's expecting something that's a number but it's actually something else does that make sense of her yep yeah okay so I'll show you why did that so what I want to do is we want to try make Bob 4 go forward but if it doesn't work so if it doesn't work we want to say try do that but the except thing means except if we get a value error so the value error did you see how when I tested my program before we got something called the value error so what we're telling our code here is we want to make Bob go forward but if we get a value error we want to do something else so make sure to put that Kohl in there and press ENTER and now in this line we can tell it what else to do instead of making Bob go forward so what I might do is I might say print and I might say sorry that is not a valid number okay so it's kind of like saying an error message so I'll quickly explain it again so once we lost the user for the put like we've saved whatever they typed in we want to try make Bob go forward so if they type in a number and it's fine then we'll Bob will go forward and there's no issues but if like say you accidentally typed this space and try to make Bob go forward it wouldn't work because it can't convert a space into a number so that's why we're saying if it gets that error so that type of error is called the value error we want to tell the person sorry that's not a valid number and then we want to make them we want to ask them again how far will Bob travel and then you can make make Bob go forward again if you want so before doing that we'll just do this sorry that's not a valid number thing and see what happens okay so if you press and run and run module we'll try test it and see what happens so first just test it normally by typing in a number like 10 and see if it moved and then make sure to do the angle and now if you type in like a letter it gives you the error message did that work for everyone else yep yep does that kind of make sense so it was a bit confusing cuz it's like a new concept but didn't make sense how it looked yes so no all kind of so David did it make sense to you yep yep okay just that did it make sense to you what we did with that try and accept thing yeah yeah okay cool so what we can do is you can add it for the angle as well you can do the same code so what you can do is you can just copy this line of that bunch of coats the try/except and underneath angle you can paste it make sure that it's still all indented nicely and then instead of in the second in the bit you copied instead of doing the bobbed up forward you can so I'm just pressing ctrl C to copy and ctrl V to paste and then ctrl X to cut and then ctrl V to paste so I'll just add some spaces so you can see what's happening so what we're doing is just doing the same thing but for the angle this time so we're gonna we ask the person what angle do they want Bob to turn if it's a number then it will turn that angle and if it's not then it'll say sorry that's not a valid number so it's like a little error message so you know how when we did it we got an error message but it was like that error message in red so it's a bit confusing this is us actually typing in our own error messages in the program so what it does is it allows you to still run the program but it just tells the person of the error message so did everyone type and paste it did it work for you Chester I just know what happened that's good so now make sure yep so make sure if you haven't tested it already to test it and see that both were the angle under distance angle turn Hey sorry that's none of that work on there yep so my one works does everyone else as well yep yep cool it doesn't work what is you're saying okay do you want to maybe get you to share your screen just so I can see what it is I'll stop sharing mine also it's 530 now so I'll quickly help just the fixes but David did you as well okay and everything yes yeah did you have any questions all right no it was all clear it was all clear okay that's good so if you want you can leave or you can just quickly see what they show is with Chester's as well if you wanted to just see what it was before leaving so I'll just quickly see so Justin if you just run your program give me that ah okay so I see what the error is so do you see how it says something called name error the name distance is not defined you just forgot the letter e I'm pretty sure yep so you just misspelled distance so just add in the e yep so a name error means there's something wrong with that like a name of your variable generally it usually means it can't find the variable and also Chester okay let you run it first yay yay cool and one more thing suggest if you go back to your code you actually I think you asked yes so you make Bob move forward twice because do you see how you have it straight off for the first thing and then you have it in that try except function so get rid of it underneath the distance equals thing not that not that line the line underneath so just yeah just that line because otherwise you're just repeating it twice and then it's moving double so you can just press backspace but yeah other than that did anyone have any other questions no no okay so then that's the end of the lesson I'll see you guys next week then okay good bye bye
