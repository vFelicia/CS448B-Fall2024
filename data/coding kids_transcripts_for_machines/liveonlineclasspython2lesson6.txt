so again if you don't want your face recorded you can turn off your webcam part so excited line up okay I don't mind cool so let me share my screen again so yeah we're just gonna review like the files thing again cuz we did that a couple of weeks ago and because we're gonna make a project with that you can just open up I don't know if you save that project from a couple of weeks I think it was just like a few line boy he was no I think it's okay we found that I like you know I'm still okay okay no I don't have it I can I think I have to restart it's okay no that's enough I got I got it actually okay you found it it's okay cuz it's only like lines anyway yeah yes I was just gonna quickly explain it you know sorry that's your screen I develop on my tree right okay that's okay you can just open a new file close we're just gonna be emulating mine anyway cuz we're just gonna like go through it again okay so let me know when you have that open yep sorry I have it open okay open so with file so the reason we can like we use like files like saving and writing and reading file in Python projects is so like the main reason this usually when you make a program like so far all the programs are made like as soon as you close it you just like nothing is safe run it again it's just like starting from you so that's why we save the pole do you remember this line that says like yeah open o file don't open them yep so file equals open okay yes open yep and then you have the brackets opening and closing brackets use the normal round brackets and then inside that we can tell what type of file it is so I'll just quickly say so to like bring in a file into a Python project and save it as a variable we use this bit of code so like the open the open file doesn't actually like open a file in the like it doesn't open up like that txt file it's just saying within this program we kind of want to open it in a certain way so do you remember the three different modes so yes yep read mmhmm action right yes good job so do you remember the difference between them yes yep right you could you could add things on to it but then whenever you restarted it every set mmhmm read I believe you can add to it and it will stay like that as well oh no wait exactly kind of so you are right with the right one um do you know what append this know exactly sorry yeah that's like no that's fine that's completely fine so we'll just quickly go with right again just to like test our memory so when we go file equals open it's just saving it in a variable in our program called file so like that's the variable name so this can be anything so this could be like you know variable name things just to get this straight mmhm the name of the actual file is in file yes so that's not the name of the actual file so this is the name of the variable so later on in our program if you want to do something with the file instead of calling it like the file name we can call it by this variable name the your current so where we put the actual file name is inside the brackets so if we want to call it something like test file again and we want to save it as a text file so we can go up txt we do that so this is the actual name of the file this is just like a variable which we kind of saved the file in in our probe in our program so we can use it later on so what we're saying is we're having this file name like it's a text file called test file and so we'll start with right so we want to open it in the right mode so you do a comma and then you type in a W okay so if you want just quickly save that and then run it if you want so I have this one last time I'm just gonna delete it so what it will do is when you open it like this in write mode if it can't find any file name with this name so if I can't find it in this computer where your Python project is saved it will make a new file so when you run your program now you should be able to see that yep so I just have to save it somewhere so yeah that's fine okay how's it run does it run okay give it a bit okay it's and now oh okay you might have got a I got an error you got it oh yes I got it nope you got it I got it cool I think okay I just typed something wrong let me run it again okay but did you get a file like just a blank text file that opened up so whatever whichever folder on your computer like wherever you saved this Python project there might be a file called test file something new yeah I it is there I see it because I I'm on it okay you're on it so right now it's just empty cuz it just made an empty file yeah yep was it not assigned to operate it okay I'm just gonna call this file okay so with this thing with the line of code you know how I said we could be like a call it variable name or something like that it I'm pretty sure you have to call it file so because it's like a set thing about opening and closing files you have to use a variable name file okay that way to me sorry what do you mean by that so you know how right now in your code you have file is equal to open or something yeah you know how I said this word file is just a variable name it's not the actual name of our file yeah so then I I told you like you could change it to something else like variable I look something like that so I think because like opening and closing files uses this function like open and it's like a set function you can only save it to a variable old file like that's the name cuz if I try it like this with a different variable name and try run it I get an error I should I don't know hey never mind sorry for confusing you you just can't have hat um dashes in your verbal name so it's quite thin you can't have that so that's why I did it with if you have something that has two words so I have a variable file for example you just like do it in something called camel case have you heard of camel case before No so camel case is like do you see how this is two different words yeah camel case means it's all lowercase except for like the next word that you're joining across did you see how like in is name yep that's what camel case is so it's like you start every word with a capital letter when it's like smushed together except the first one so if like this name had another one you can be like hello like if that was one variable name that's camel case that's a different topic anyway what so when you run this file open it doesn't actually open any files in the background it just makes it so you should see that and again you can change this to whatever type of file you want so for example if you are somehow later on like making a HTML file and if you wanted to add like a HTML page with Python code you can just save it as dot HTML so that would save it as a HTML file so try change that on yours and then run it then if you go back into where your files are saved you should see like something called test file a testing file don't HTML this time yep I actually have two test files now you have two test file so yep so one was like the one you made last time that's like with that's a normal text file it's just text and this one is now a HTML file so if we actually had HTML code later in it if you like clicked on it it would open up like the website but right now it would just be empty cuz it's nothing so yeah you can just save things so it doesn't just have to be like plain text it depends what type of file you want to save it as okay anyway back to the point we just go back to text or yeah so maybe we go back to text txt so with the right mode like you said you can write things in it and so do you remember how we write things in it is it possibly I want to say after a friend so that's one way we can write in it so append is like you add something on to what's in the file so you can do that with this actually but what you need to do is you need to change the mode so right now we're in like right mode if you want to append to the file you need to change it to a so what a pen does is it remembers what we already have in our file and then add something on to the end if we do it in right it would just replace everything with what we write again so like let me show you so what we need to do is we need to get our variable name we need to go file dot write and then we can write some come write some text so we just have brackets and if this were HTML how would we do it okay so I can quickly show you so do you know some basic HTML tiny bit kind of it all right that's okay so why don't we quickly change our file back to an HTML file so we can test it out so file dot write what we could do is we could make a HTML like you know HTML tags yeah yeah so generally we need to put it in like a haitch tml like a big tag like that and then I'm just pressing into a few times just so it's easy to see and then what you might need to do is type in like buddy okay wait maybe it won't present yeah so a pop like oh sorry what was your question is there nothing before the last line no that's just a five innovative nope sorry okay say Papa in no short way so you take up imports in one of the shorts one of the shorts in the nationality you can't it's gonna be hard to find it it's in one of the shorts of the laundry sure sorry about that that's all good okay so these are just some basic HTML tags but what do you do app how do you actually coat something in like yeah so with HTML well I'll just finish writing this first to show you so you know how much HTML you have like your different tags so you have like HTML tags body tag and then like you might want to add like a header so a header could be like h1 and then we can type in some text like this is a header and then we close the h1 so if you have a look like wait whoopsie oh wait I think it we're missing something do we need a smash after the HTML yes so that's on this side here so with oh yeah so which HTML tags you have one that's like normal and then when you want to close it at the end you add a slash to the end one like if I just press ENTER to show you I just press the Enter just to show you what I'm talking about I think there's a way to do a multiline thing and yeah so I just didn't enter just so that you can see like the rough structure of it I'm just ignoring the quotation one spinel but like this is a basic idea of what like a basic page might look like so we just have like HTML tag and then a body tags and then it's the heading it's a pretty basic like you know just some simple tags and then we're just writing it into the file I'm just putting it back on one line for that it's just neat me so let me know when you've typed in yes so you know I was let me just check yes yeah I was typing oh wait how do you I put in something actually different it's coming from the book him doing a hyperlink yep that's fine do you know how it doesn't seem to be working I did HTML then I did a curve equals HTTP then ww google.com mmhmm and then I called a Google I did a in the slash and then HTML but it seems to be giving me an error ofc I see there it's an embarrassing error and so good I forgot to put the brackets all right yeah so with this so python like when you put it as a string like python doesn't know that it's HTML code or anything like that so you won't get any code relating I mean any errors relating to like the HTML stuff the errors will be like something in the Python file like if you think so it's not finished but how if it's not showing anything what do we do so doesn't seem to be showing anything okay so whereas in when you run it yep yep so have you refreshed the page as well yes a unique turning it right okay wait hands and I'll run also run module and then you need to open the one that's the HTML file yeah hmm yep okay yet so it might just because there's like a there might be a different way okay yeah so this is with Python so we're writing out text but you know how I don't know if you remember from last week every time you like use this open function when you're done with you need to do something else do you know yet close yep so we'll try fail mmhm don't close your file equal file dot close and then brackets so that just tells our program okay we're done writing the file you can finish it off or whatever like it doesn't keep waiting for you to type more so okay so now make sure to run it first and then check it out so that well okay I'm okay it has to text but it's not showing the hyperlink okay so that might be like issue with like the way you did HTML code so let me have a look so the hyperlinks make sure when you have like a hey trip so like wwhen ma know yeah I put it says to put them in one quotation marks and yep I did do two HTTP and make sure at the end you also have like the a slash a slash HTML you want to quickly share your screen so I can have it look okay sure but also after this will go back to the Python stuff yes I know that's fun I was just it's good so that you can just get an idea on how to write the files like that's what I have if you want I can make it okay I see what it is so you know you have the slashes like you have a like the slashes should be before the a and before the HTML so you you know you have it after the word oh yeah I see it yeah yes I another thing with like HTML and stuff is even if you have an error it won't like it's not like Python it won't say there's an error in this line so it won't work it just tries to like show the text normally because it's more for like display okay wait maybe if I go okay fish also when you ran it so when you did file run it should say like the file name so you might have closed it a bit early not sure well maybe just try and run it again oh I see it AC ah there we go so do you mind if I stop sharing yep yeah I'll share my screen now so it will stop yours so yeah so that's just an example on life it doesn't just have to be text files that you're writing into it could be HTML files like and you can edit different sort of stuff so I'll just quickly go go so that was right so if you like try edit your text so go back to your Python program so right now your says Google or something should I change that text just like something else like this is Google or something like so right now like your file was like the only thing was like that Google link but now you change it to this is Google so because this is in right what do you think will happen wait what do you mean by sorry so ok sorry so right now like if you look at my one so my text like I have a heading and it's cold this is a header yeah and now like I ran that and I open it and that's what it says but now I'm editing my Python program and I changed it to say this is another header so if when I save this file and then run it and then open up microfiche this HTML page I think it's will say I think it'll say this is another just simply not just simply about nothing else yeah yep okay yes you're correct so if you wanted it to write it underneath it so if you wanted to keep I had already written before and write the new line underneath it do you know what we might need to do yes the slash not exactly so I'll show you what I mean so when I run this you said it will just say this is another header like another header and it will like delete what's already there right yeah yep so if we don't want to delete it we would need option yeah exactly so we would need a pin so to do that you just change the W to an A so that way it still remembers what you had last time and it just adds on to it so like if you're playing a game like over a few days instead of like refreshing the skull every time you might want to keep it and save it so you can test it if you want but no okay what exactly is a project you want you to do yep so I'll show you that after so just like I'm just quickly going over this stuff just so we have an idea and what to do I'll show you the project now actually so it's just like a it's like a shopping list program but if I just so what it does is I think I might have showed you this shopping this program before but this time it actually saves what you have yeah give me a second is just loading being a little sir okay so can you see my screen sir yep yep okay so just saying welcome to your shelf English and then I think I showed you like how you can add stuff to your shopping list I can put one and I might want to add an apple to my list all right let me run it again I think I typed in L instead of one but basically with this program you can either add stuff to a shopping list like view your shopping list delete your shopping list or just quit the game so that's like the options one to the info so should I just should I just delete it or what we have right now yeah so just delete what you have right now I'll just try and get this up again to show you one second okay yep so it's saying how can I help you like press one to add something for us too to do this etc etc so if I press 1 press ENTER they okay there seems to be some issue with this code I tried it like a second ago okay let me try sorry about that I tested it just the whole and it did work I'm not sure what's happening now let me try get it up here instead okay so can you still see my screen yes yep so I'm just running it to here and said so what I'm doing is I just pressed one to add something to the list and I'll just add an apple and then I might want to add something else and I'll add a pair and now if I want to see what's in my shopping list I press 2 and it gives me my list right so now I just want to quit the game so right now I just have apple and pear in my list if I press full and enter it will click the game now if I go back to my files where they're saved do you see how it added something called shopping list dot to you if I click on that it has my shopping list so it has apple and pear so now because I've closed the program so now if I run the program again if I straight away sorry will it restart it and it doesn't restart it cuz the file is there now if I press number 2 which displays the shopping list it tells me I have apple and pear and the first time you try it does it have nothing in it yep so I'll delete this file and show you because the first time I try it the file does not exist so if I try to display it it has nothing in it so so what should be should I just start with file a lot right yes so what we need to do is we need to like yes oh okay let's just open up idle we want to start with yeah filed up right actually filed a pen because if it's there already we want to add to that little file we don't want to replace everything so file now shopping list equals right umm yeah so you can call it shopping list or you can still call it file so that in the program you know that's the file polls open what am i doing roughly open low and open and then right and open it and then shopping list yep shopping list dot txt because we want to save it as a text file King yes G and if I were to Chum others can I ask something else yeah chuckles if you order like write something from the file not from Pythian on App hand would it stay there well let's test it out so you mean like if I go in if I actually open that it's not anymore if I open the shopping list and add like another thing like another me know if you yeah if you open the shopping list and add something yeah okay that's me here we'll be there next time yes it should be so let me just create the shopping list again because I deleted it so I'm just gonna add Apple and pretend that was already there so now what you're asking is if I actually open the not the Python file the shopping list file and added something else yep so let me add in my milk maybe and save it you want to see if it would be there yes please yep well the answer is we'll find out so we want to display our shopping list so we have apple and milk so yes it does appear in our shopping list alright so how it does that is with the other function the read function because it reads everything in the file and then it shows us all right so what do we do then shopping shopping list equals open shopping list of takes P happen mmhmm so we might need to just keep that line of code there for now but we might need to actually do some other stuff for us because we actually need to make a shopping list program so you know how when I run it we actually need to do the other steps as well so what's the first thing it asks us when we run the program well what does it do it prints it prints like everything you can do yep so let's start with that first as well so we'll say hello welcome to your shopping list how can I help you doing print no isn't it print input no is it input I forgot input so if you want to save what the like if you want the user to type something after the line new yeah like yeah so uh no wait are you just doing print and then you're gonna put please like and open yeah because if you have a look in the program if I like because it continues on right if I press one and then like add in an apple it says please select an option again so that's separate from that first welcome message like that first welcome message is just a print statement and then later on we'll add the please select an option thing go free what is this and then do you remember how we did a new line like with tile / yup so if you don't want to keep like writing print things you can do it all in one with the slash and then do we just put the slash on the end yep so you just put slash on the end and then you can keep typing okay wait it's a back cord / yes I think that my gosh and how oh wait what's your replace dialog which dialog sorry I actually opened something alright it was replaced and mmhmm and then you can keep doing it all like with the end thing but I might just do this in a new print statement just so that it's like a bit neater huh I might just wait do you have to do two n/a on the end enough no print you can but because the print line automatically does it in a new line oh so like you could do it by just like print this print this print list but it's just if you wanted to do it all in one you can use that in so it's adding displaying clearing and then quick and is it and do we just normally is it normal that we leave the line before the slaps then do what do you mean by lines I do you mean like we made a lot yeah we leave some space yeah um you don't have to leave this place I just leave the space just so it's easy for me to read it when I'm looking okay but it doesn't matter if you don't leave this place it just means like there'll be a space before it goes into the next line but you don't really see that in the Python program so it doesn't matter too much yeah I'm just gonna once you've done that just quickly save what was free sorry free water was clear your shopping list okay for always quit exist exit this program yep and then mmm okay so you know how you us is there different like if you add the space before the new line thing yeah they're the I additive space before and after so if you look at my program it has like a space before and after so it just depends on how you want it to look I forgotten like before here Oh what do you mean by that okay so do you see how can you see my program yeah so like every time I have a new line do you see how like 2 3 & 4 have a space in front of it yeah that's just because I went flash in space and then the next thing where is the first one I just I didn't do a face I just started I like right away so if I ask something so how do we take off wait so do you take off the space after the end or before your slash after the end so if you don't want that space to be there you like take away the space otherwise Python things you want this week to be good so like it will be slash an demonstrate away to or whatever you and what about what about the space the space before the slash doesn't really matter because you can't actually see it so it's okay before the flash is like this thing but because it's a space and it's at the end of the line you don't notice it it's just if you make a new line and then have a space then it's more noticeable okay so yep so you have that done if you want you can just run it to see yeah sorry but then I just have to try and find a place to save it that some make sure it's somewhere you remember listen sorry program also just make sure if you had that line of code you know how you've said file equals open or something yeah you might want to just comment it out for now oh man they close it okay cool yeah because if you open it and then don't close it it might cause some issues they turn sideway I am just I'm just gonna add a slash and AH after the first one so that looks like you're one of it oh yeah yeah I might do that that's it lastly like a doubledouble fashion mistake here hi I'm a shopping list and how can I help you so you might need a double slash okay yep I see one problem there I can do that okay let's check it out right I did not I don't remember it's always good to like test it even if like what we did was just a small change it's always good to run it like it straight after that so you know how do I actually do stuff okay no I see you know can you add two slashes yep yes you can you can add all of them anyone so you just do slash in again as and if you want another space yeah okay okay yeah I have it wait what how you want it really I might do it a bit sorry take seven are you okay that's fine hey everybody how long you want you ready yeah it's like so the next thing we want to do is we want to ask them like please select an option and then again just remember it keeps like doing it so we need like if we want to keep asking to use or something I'll keep running the favor input but you have to put input there yep so I'd have to put input to ask it so like input but also we want to save the input so tell me how I do that yeah we have to do the variable equals input your are we gonna call the variable so we could call it something like choice because it's like saving us whichever choice a choice is equal to input and now in porch please select an option please see a shear and just remember so with the input thing like it puts the cursor right after your text so if you want there to be a space off the please select an option you have to add that space there like before the quotation mark finishes because otherwise when you type it'll be right next to like the letter n because it'll be like please select an option I will be right next to that semicolon mmhmm if that makes sense yep and another thing we want to add is in our program because you want to keep like be able to keep adding or removing or like just keep doing different options so what's something we need to add to make this thing repeat we need forever yep forever do you know do you remember how to type it with Python yes wait give me second sorry that's fine finish what yes I believe it is while true yep exactly so while true and then make sure to tab that choice thing inside so that it knows that's part of the while loop okay so you can run it if you want just to check it but by the way and then oh wait oh okay it does wait till your so it has to be in the while loop the choice yep so the choice on anything I see what you mean again yeah yes so like that welcome message just as like happens once which is why we just did print and then the choice was just a while wait this nope famous again this is this it's a bit fiddly cuz anthalie okay the problem is just because you have so much in one print yeah it does that you have to go to the end yeah so you can do them in individual print as well it just it's just a different way of doing it you can also format your page whoopsie okay I made a number see if it's just so hard be like okay you want I think I might have to just large it so I think you can also edit the look of your page by okay there we go fish really enter okay I got it sorry about that oh yeah so this is why we separated like the print and the input statements because so I I got it out to Walter you selected option mmhmm okay what's those invented do you know a way because I mean I know this might be a bit new to ask but if you come format it asks you if you can change the in bit region or Pullman out Regent uncommon is there something that you can do to make it short term as I'm like yeah because they always have to type for and sometimes I get confusing your like to type in for like spaces yeah I mean it's good it's still okay no that's a fine question one thing you can do is you can press tab instead of space but we're so like on your keyboard I think it so I see it on like before caps look if you just press tab it automatically puts it in that thing okay thank you yeah and another thing is if your text is like if you press ENTER straight after your while loop it automatically indents it as well so again my cursor here but yeah okay so then even choice hmm it's the exclamation mark before equals it is isn't it uh we want to check if choice is equal to one first are you trying to check if it's not equal to something oh okay I guess yeah that's what I okay that's what I was gonna go check but it makes more sense the way you're doing it and make it so you can check if it is equal to one equals one then wait is it normal that you're putting them in brackets so okay sorry I'm used to other programming languages yeah but thank you for pointing that out yeah choice equals equals one and so just remember when you with like an input with the input function what does it save like your value as do you know what type of data it saves it I was like I believe it which it generally say a string yeah so what we can do is we can say if choice is equal to one as a string yeah but it's already straight isn't it so yeah no sorry I'm saying in this if statement if we go if choice is equal to one just like the normal number one then it's they're not equal to each other because one is a string and one is a number so we have to check if choice is equal to look like one as a string yeah if that makes them yep hey okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do this a bit differently so we're gonna have do you remember functions sorry yep yep so we're going to make each little thing a definition so like inserting into a file as a definition removing etc etc so if choice is equal to one we want to add something to the shopping list yeah we can at the top shop then we can just go shop I show up this ad hold it and then mmhmm now don't need any variables right I mean any of your amethyst noumea no no we don't cuz it's just like the one thing so make sure when you're defining your function you do it before that while loop okay we want to go death I might call it insert some now this is where we yeah oh sorry what do you think we would probably do like choice 1 equals input and then it's drag if choice 1 equals what so yeah we'll just go in shocking right ad choice 1 equals employee important choice yes so what we want to do is we can also like open our shopping list so this time this is where we're doing like the append thing with the file shouldn't we open the shopping this before or so we'll do it each in the functions because inserting the function we just want to add to the shopping list open I think yeah no isn't it file open yes you call shopping list sure thing and it's an equal sign just equals and now whatever you want to call the file so G shopping let's stop txt I might call it that dope King if it's okay I'd like to get up and then okay yep so I continue okay so comma and then do you want to which one do you want to use do you want to use like write a pen I think we're using up the hand aren't we yep what I use I make sure the a is also in so now what we want to do is we want to sorry question yes if it for example in one of them it says app end can you then change it to write do you mean up here can you change it to write so no I mean like if if for example insert its and then if it was choice would it be all right like do you mean like in a different function no I mean like if you're just using yeah can you change throughout the code yes you can so what you can do is like in this little function here what we're going to do is we're going to open it in append mode do our stuff and then close it so we're done with that section so later in the code we can open it in a different mode okay so shopping list equals open mmhmm and then what would we do then we would go how right yep so before writing it we always need to ask the user what they want to add right yep yep so what we could say is like two choice tonight Tim oh yeah choice two so yeah item maybe like it's like the thing to add what if it runs again when again would item not be saved so item is just a variable we make here so every time it runs again it like reset reset yeah so it saves on top of it kind of so like item equals Apple then later on item might equal milk yes I turn equals in which and I we could say something like you like and hey and we're almost running out of time so we'll quickly finish this inset one and then we can finish the rest of it next week okay yep so we have item yep now we actually need to write item into our file into that shopping list file so this is where you go like a shopping list stop right yep so we want to add something right are we wonder she's referring to shopping list are you referring to the file or to the parable so up the variable so I might rename it to like file just so that we don't get confused and then you would write down in spite of it yep file so file is the variable name and then yes so we use this actual like the actual text file name we never use that apart from at that beginning part so then we just do shopping list don't write him right I me up I tried yep and because it's actually a variable we don't need to put it in quotation marks and then what we might need to do is just add a new line after that like we didn't have to put weight we'd only have to put in quotation marks we don't because it's a variable so like you know how when you print stuff you just go print the variable name you still put it in about you still put in brackets yet you put in brackets you just don't put like oh okay things that make it green I get yeah yeah because otherwise it will write the actual word item yes okay yep okay school and what we want to do is we just want to write item and then just add a new line so that next time we want to add something it's already on the new line so to do that you know how in print when you want to like add a variable plus some text you'd go plus okay and then so flashing okay now we can go back into our while loop and then with that if statement we can say if it's choice one we just want to do that insert all function whatever you thing was gold yep and then run it and see what happens add an extra space so just test it with one from now if you want to add a bunch of stuff you can keep nope it I must have built something incorrectly it's not very happy okay arrows it says something okay I see the ball you say bubble yep I was missing up being one of them I was missing a pain one of them oh yeah so sometimes it's easier to have that variable name of the file as a smaller name like file or something okay here we go one enter what we'd like to add to me it's like an option one one three ones yeah so now like once you've added a few things you can go into your new text file one eggs one so I'm adding some yes coffee I know I just coffee okay and then close it close it and then you should see like shopping list txt or something are you see a shopping list it doesn't say don't cheat Arthur okay euros might display it differently but not like you know I got everything okay cool um so we might just leave it at that and I'm finish it off next week because the lesson is over but do you have any other questions nope did it make sense so far yep did it make a bit more sense now that we actually like started making a program okay cool that's good anyway I'll see you next week then see you have a good week
