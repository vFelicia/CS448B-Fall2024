okay I'm going to say Wartortle as usual that's we use always and then say Massey be cool dance naked turtle with the T character and I'm going to import random as well because I'm going to use random choice I would tell you how if you don't know oh it's the new things for you so let's see what I have really you hate oh you like up so we have neg I do so both of you choose Apple your sister okay I said I should say apart from human human animals no animals could be yeah animals could be there so we accepted things stuff okay camera cool to get into a fish tank is a good see that fish could be survived over there be those in the air we don't need air at the moon for fish because isn't water so maybe it's a good idea okay hmm so I'm going to put make a list so if you remember how we make at least the same that me I'm going to just make variable it's called pastry and we're going to say equal the square bracket so when I'm going for the guys that don't know about how to make at least I'm going to say you just make it the same things that we don't for variables and then instead of just saying something I need to put a square bracket here and inside the bracket I'm going to put your stuff the quotation so the first things also you guys IBM makes cheese apples on say that's a to Apple ya parts and sorry no your sister we couldn't take care and okay banana ice house camera do you have any specific brand of camera that's it do you want to put first you're not was simple professional what else we have each other you need to give me two give me two actual items that I can put it here so because I I have one items that is to Apple so you need to give me in other items naked aunty already give me the other one so clear and give already gave me two so I'd be one of you guys give me another one Nate you need to give me are some items because I didn't accept your sister ok fishtank my spaceship just before dad I'm going to use random to ask computer randomly choose a which item is accepted to put it in spaceship and put it in the moon actually so because already we have one two three four five I need another one items I need six item each of you to give me the other one if two of us said apples yeah it's okay but give me another one because I need six items everybody one of you guys okay that's too many okay Arjun come on at the car it can expand it yeah I can't expand them that's it I mean PI since it so that it's across the whole screen and I'm going to say print shoes so here I'm going to ask the computer computer to just randomly give me one of those let's say you're gonna win my spaceship I'm quitting in the moon sir exam okay let me run it so who wind force the car so the car is win Karen okay Karen win your car in the moon your cards now that's a big house how many quick carry the cards they put it in a spaceship and put it in the moon cool let's see who's the next winner one two three stone who was Stone snake okay cool Nick is the second winner let's see who's the first winner one two three again okay that's any question guys you have or do you want to write it down and see what you're gonna give you change you can't put your done you know I know okay cool what items you have yeah what's about unique wants to share with us to come see who's for spinner would like to share my okay but do you like to share it with us share your screen I mean that's nice like it banana who was choose banana good job yes sir cargo okay.what so you put it in a white circle good job you already know some different methods excellent keep back okay thank you looking for see that if it's something that they can work on eyes or we already finished everything but we can have some games so let's see I think what which actually takes that venture last one we had say because I work with you Josh and I going to I don't want to repeat it again for you why other guys doesn't know that I can post the code or something would you like to share a vehicles have a look here we have a game it's so we say what is your name and then say greeting let's go on an adventure only enter the options available or the game will end you're on the edge of the forest can you get true would you like to go into the forest enter yes or no say yes you go into the forest in front of you is a stone with two weapons which one do you want inter sword opal so you say you choose the bow the path splits in front of you to the left is appear the bear to the right it's pitch black in turn right or left say left you see the the brandish Europe and fight you have no arrows you're eaten game over okay would you like to share the code as well how was it look like so the guys I can cope in see the cords including a function so I'm going to say at the picking link so we have greeting prints and say let's go and on adventure and then some blah blah things and then say make your function I just added this in myself oh yeah easier to ask stuff yeah that's that's a good idea that's perfect and and he said he make it function it's called question print printer so when you say what's just a a one it's the question a one and or a to cool you put it in a different function neck do you know about function how do we define a function not really it's you say so go with the beginning so the question from the beginning that it's put in comments like yeah question would you like to go into the forest and if the response equal yes that when we say that when we use two equal signs that means we want to compare two posts so we say responses inside the response variable is yes or no but when we put just one equal this is different things that means we put their value you inside the variables so with the difference between comparing and defining and variable it's like that so here when in if we use two equal signs that means we comparing to both sides to each other but the difference so for example when we say here phrase the variable U you see yeah like the weapons so weapons equal response that's one its variables could you tell me another variable stats yeah that's it what condition that videos whenever we say more than for example here wouldn't say if back to the beginnings part so when we say if response double equal yes it's going to print us you go into the forest else if we say la otherwise so if the response wasn't yes is going to say check is going to say L if response equal no so sometimes the customer put yes sometimes no and then if it's no prints then you are not really goodbye with the name that we asked at the beginning and then quit times you say quit to the function finish here and is not going to the else line is going to be created is going to be go to choose a weapon time part but if something is you know user doesn't put yes or no so put the nonsense things so that at that time we say we use else if it's not none of those neither yes nor no is going to else say print kills if didn't understand you I didn't understand you game over it's a good example of how we use ifelsif and is and we can say quit in else as well but it's there's a mother here the next part choose a weapon say question after we actually ask the user that do you want to go to the first or not and then you say grab a weapon so in front of you is torn with two weapons that this and then weapon is say equal response what's response here their responses something that we ask yeah we ask it you can put in put in after weapon locks a weapon equal input the question so how the question coming could you adequately writes in front of things that coming like say with an equal response for now to just guys understand apart so say repent equal input and they could you do it could I after why would you say a weapon equal input so I want to show the guys that how we use input the inputs and was inside the use yep use the question that yeah like that okay I've just tell it like this because I have a function yes because any use function so you can you can put it back Thanks and then instead of saying that you just say with less cord he used less code with saying just response but he defined it at the beginning at the top in function question function and then it's say if say if she's answer if response here so response now is different things that we have in beginning in beginning part so response gets a different value it's before it was yes or no now it's soared over so you say if response equal W Coast sword or response to echo if one of those they say just you choose this particular choosen rip weapon else so we don't use elseif here because we don't need it because we already he actually put in the same time with or and at hand said do you guys like to write it down now or yeah quickly do ya please maybe you couldn't send it at all together let's try if you're not just put it you can copy for example ten lines not just one line but one line or more even try see if you can copy all and then paste it here okay thank you thing is it all yeah guys copy and paste it and then work it up at home that worked it later because we're going to do in other games because Eddie already or more than one is the forward so we shouldn't respect edited always went in on time and always being present just remember to put in who import part as well at the beginning so you need to just reverse or snake and care and you need to just realize that before you need to revise that before right so just remember to put import and the other things as well oh good did you finish copy and paste and save your file and can you don't need to do anything else you just copy and paste it in your file and save it and then I'm going to start a new game oh good yeah okay let's do the other one I'm going to say use the very wise Christians so tell me the question before I'm going to get into kind of part of at least question what is the tares planet from the Sun who knows I'm using a different list bar or sink like that let's see I'll show you how to use it what is the name of something orbiting a planet what is or satellite so what once we have that was the planet that's not a planet these things that we have around Aires that's going around us we can see it at the night time I put the answer here like that so if you mention it I will explain it what planet has rings neck it goes to the I think that kid does as well uh yeah that's true I just say those and I'm going to you score as a rebel and put the initial value as 0 introduction so I'm going to say the introduction for my game say the name it's just getting the name again Nate how we use how we break in line and put the cursor at the second line here if I say yeah I put the space that's nice you can name your game as a space create system we can look here by saying question the question is time list and it's that I show you here and I use then the land of question so that means three points random dot choose three years and convert the dictionary case this type of question this type of variable it's it's called dictionary King you might be stating the next can but for now it's good to know how you use it good questions the answer that question equal Christians question now I changed the question that was dictionary key to a list now I can use as a list him if you couldn't understand yet I arranged back and explained every part don't worry about that keep going and say once we have player takes so the gist variable its equal input the question that we have just into the next chick yes yes bless you so it's going up the question the guess wasn't the same as answer so screams it's a invalid syntax really rich punch for you know where you're defining your dictionary it's saying no syntax on the color okay let me see just lets me finish this part and I back Ferris and I run it see what's lets me run it okay so mine it's work yours is saying I'm gonna check it later with you as well so when you finish writing till now I'm going back to explain here what does it mean this point I think would you like to send it by chance your error when Theresa or your coat it it's having the airhead this part tell you an error yeah did you put comma after each part each line so it's separating so you'd like just the last one doesn't come my first bit is working with mine but the second bit doesn't work that's why before we going to see your course I'm going to explain so what does mean it's kind of dictionary key variables so this kind of type we define it like this so for example so the same question so each question has value has a key and value so the first show you how so we define it like the same variable we have fire to be using the kind of this bracket what we call it you know guys how we call this quotation what is called this one I don't know but it's the difference that we use this symbol and then we say key so the key it's something that we use and every key has a value and we separate you separate each part each item by comma so each king he could be number could be a string and this one value could be I put it in a different way so the key I just want to show you how we define a dictionary so every part every item that we have it has a key and value and it separated each item with comma that's look looks the same that we have in this and then again he column ready and again he turned enclose the part so the dictionary case each item has one key and one value the value it's belonging to the king for example here that this question has an answer by saying airs so the airs answer is belonging to this question not the other question just this question and so like that just remember I put it as it come as just explanation here just remember that each dictionary key we use one key and one reading so how we use it as you see after we define the dictionary key we use it like saying question should be questions if should be questioned the same as we use it here so if you had a mistake type of mistake like meaning just corrected the questions questions so how many is that I say questions dot key for example lot of dads and put it in for example as a variable so the answer that is the value its questions start key and the things that is similar you know that all things and then I'm use here I'm used to Lynn off question what does it mean how many time or how many items there is in question trace all yet is going to three times so why then that said lands love questions three times it's counting how many items there is here and who did them and the same that we have the use random choose that we're using spaceship to pick on one of the cheese and I'm using list here because I'm going to change question keys that is a the kind of dictionary key to a list so it's convert my addiction your key to a mist see how after that I used question a square bracket and Christian so the same that we have we had before to use them list to use when I rarely use list we use like that because I convert it and then put it in the answer another bits not working for me or it says question equals random dot choice it's not working you won't set as we had where it says answer equals questions question it says says like D ICT object is not callable okay could you send it to me and remember and don't forget to change the question we have to they friends variable so we have questions with this and here we have question there just don't mix it up so question here and then Christians could you send it to me as well Nick do you want to say which line has a problem for you as well you can send it to me as well or share your screen which one is more country for you it says questions is not defined okay remember I have a look I said questions we have yes and then here just question our YouTube so you have to change your first questions and we s just put questions the first variable you use the dictionary key it's Christians and when we convert it we say question and what is okay so when we when you convert or at least you put it in the variable called question that you stick it in a queue okay we want to just saying just say instead of the first line after wine say Christian be cool random like this yep but I'm 10 an answer should be in a square bracket so say answer equal questions bracket square bracket and then put their question not to you so whenever you just here just replace any question does it work for unique for me it doesn't stop after 3 yes Bernie Sanders I'm going to send it to all your groans because we already run out of time are we going to continue next session I send it by chats the cookie and give it and you will see before pasted have a look what's different between your code and Michael maker centered on chat so just copy and put in a different copy and have it because I'm going to close that and you're gonna miss it so just copy and paste it in a new file and have a precise look it doesn't stop because it's in the right yeah it's okay as long as you don't have any error that's fine because we're gonna continue it next session okay cool great everything's fake house going on it's great for you did you get that okay cool I do you good I'm still hoping your time you can work on the last the previous court like you save it I suspect I'll just go forest so have a look run the game and see what you like and have a look at the cord carrying an H alright yeah everybody do you have any questions Karen goodnight already thanks see you next session have fun and enjoy your stuff y'all you can enjoy bye
