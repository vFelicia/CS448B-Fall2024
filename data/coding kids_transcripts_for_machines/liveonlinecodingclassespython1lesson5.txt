and then I'll share my screen let me join this tada what are we doing so I'll show you we're gonna make like I'll show you the game we're making one second so it's kind of revising pardon yeah so it's a bit like what we did last lesson so you know how we made a project last lesson which was you know it was like the wandering turtle right that moved up and now we're gonna be just doing something similar but I'll show you it's called geometry turtle it's just asking how many shapes we'll how many sides will the shape have and then if I say like three it'll make like a threesided shape but like with the shape inside of every side as well if that makes sense and I'll open it this way so you can see it better so I kind of making geometric patterns using loops and things so it's gonna be like a bit of revision of what we learn all these last few lessons yeah so yeah so if it it's awesome how many sides will the shape have so if I say five it will do it like this so it's drawing a five sided shape but then it's you doing like many ones inside it as well pardon sorry yeah it's pretty cool and then if you make like let me run it again if you make it a bigger number maybe like eight or something go back to this I might get caught off the screen a bit maybe not but yeah it looks pretty cool the more shapes you have yeah so it's like making patterns and stuff okay cool yeah making patterns would be shapes so we'll get started close this so just oh sorry this is kind of like dang kind of thingy yeah and then it would like make that mini Express and then we get oh that's way cool sounds cool like get it like oh alright so is it safe that's a Python fun I'm not sure but I'll try to get it now okay if not it's a fair otherwise I can try help you at the end of the lesson to get it open if you want you sound a cold thing we're like what my dad did I am do you want to show me deal with him stop sharing and then you can show them if you want really quickly okay so that's the code he did okay so I think the code like that's copied from like you know how we have the Python shell like you can see the little arrows so that's copied from the Python shell I think so you could probably like get rid of those stuff and then you'd be able to run it cuz it has a like yeah it has a couple of things that are errors and stuff it was it was awful Oh trying again I'm pretty sure we did was change like these things to like oh yeah yeah because if this is Python then usually uses dots instead of those friended things but yeah I like with the other end s and stuff like that yeah yeah can i big computer are trying it again I am invalid syntax okay so I think one thing is maybe because it's on the shell you might have to do it line by line possibly oh because you have like do you see the bits of code that say like trace back and stuff you don't want to type that in because that's usually a message the shell gives you so maybe next time you try try do it without the style I see I don't see he's already put the dots I know I said that's actually not code that's like just when you type something and you get an error that's the thing you get so you're not me so um let me share my screen again to show you what I'm talking about um so I do can you see my screen yep yep so do you see like this is the Python shell and those three arrows is the shell if I type something wrong I get a message that looks like that so you're not actually meant to type this fit into your code cuz it's not really like it's not really any Python code it doesn't do anything so that's why you're getting invalid syntax so you might need to try to it line by line but yet will first work on this project and then in your if when you have time maybe you can try run that code but only use the lines that have this next to it just copy what's next to the three arrows does that make sense yep okay so we'll start with this project anyway let me just run it again one knows yet copy like the words that are next to the arrows but not there it's gotta be a lot of coping yeah Oh like you copy them and put them in a file like how we've been doing and then you can just run it once okay so if we now go back to this game the one we're working on what we want to do is we first want to just look at the project and break it up a bit so what are the different things that's happening in our project so as soon as I open it it asks us something and it sets up the turtle button yeah so it's similar to that so the first thing we need to do is like what we did last time we need to ask the player how many sides will the shape F mm and then save it maybe this is it is this the one from last we know the one that my dad did all right don't didn't work yeah okay so you might need to try it after class and see what husband pardon maybe typed and healthy hours it could be oh yeah this is why there could be something like a small error in the line of code which is why I like usually when we're writing our code we test it every time we make a change or we try to that way we can see where the error is but yeah I think what you're talking about is similar to the project we're doing today so maybe it might make more sense once you do this and you might get an idea yeah I got it oh hi sorry I think there was an issue with my internet so okay you will see those two okay let me share my screen again yeah for you yeah that's a bit annoying yeah cuz it just smiled Rob's out yeah and then the other person just looks like they're frozen yeah yeah okay so anyway back to this project the first thing we want to do is we want to ask how many sides will be shaped path and then remember so do you remember about like variables and stuff so we need to save it in a variable as well so that's another step we need to do and what type of variable will do you think we need to save this answer is like will it be a string or an integer string not exactly so it saves it as a string but we need to save it as a number so that's an integer so like because we're saying how many sides will the shape have we just want to type in a number so we want to save that value as a number in our code so let's start actually typing some code so just get Idol welcome so the first thing we need to do is whenever we're doing something with turtle what do we need to type in yep awesome make yep make sure you're in a new file so not in the Python shell make sure you get a new file yep because remember the shelllike does it one by one and doesn't save it but we want to be able to save that project yep exactly and then you can run it whenever you want as well so if you want to show people the cool shapes you made whatever name you caught which I just yep good kernel dot and capital T yep and the internal so that creates our turtle thing now what we need to do is we need to ask the user for input yeah yep so do you remember how to do that Oh David I'm sorry I'm that's okay so we just started I was just showing just a before the project and we just started coding it now so if you quickly open a new file you can just follow on from where we are I think I dropped out again so David I was just saying we just started a new project so if you want to open up a new file and just follow on from where we are the first two lines so what we're making is just like a shape a thing with turtle where you type in the number of sides it will draw and it will draw a cool shape like in a pattern style thing yep so yep we've just done these two lines so far and now what we want to do is we want to ask the user for some input because we want to ask how many sides will shape Pels so to do that we type in the word input so that with the brackets and inside that you put the quotation marks yep so that will kind of like ask the question so we need to type in our question sides how many sides so this input method is how we like write a question on the screen and then the person can type in something next to it so when you guys have these three lines of code done we'll just run it cuz we also have to save it so what if you press run and then run module you're just dead right oh don't run it right now okay yeah just tell that you to run it just so that you can save it as well as finishing time when you're finished I don't yeah so David we're just importing turtle and then creating our turtle cold Bob and now we're just asking the user how many sides with our shape have yep I'm done you're putting it where just okay cool that's good yeah it's good to have them in folders so that you know we're three I call it board of patent projects uhhuh nice that's a good name then you know where they all end all in one place and don't forget get refused because like I don't have to guess because it's like I think so I know yes time for drinks you know yeah exactly so this one is called geometry turtle but you can call it what you want as long as you know what the game is about it jumped ray or Gemma G natural geo geometry like GE m ET ry yeah I'm done you're done cool and then when once you've run it like saved it it should automatically like stop the program and then a Python shell should come up and ask you how many sides will shape F and then you should also see the Python turtles graphic the Python turtle graphics window open as well did that work for everyone yeah yep no errors okay that's good so now what we need to do is we actually ask the question how many sides will the shape have but we never saved this answer anywhere so we have to save whatever the person typed in as a variable so do you guys remember how to make variables no just the new remember trying to I think I got it yeah like like a name like you gonna equals yep yeah so that's exactly right so we put in our variable name so we might call it side so this is like before the input before the word input we go sides equals and then we say sides equals this because what it's doing is it's saving whatever the user typed in as the answer into a variable call sign yep David have you done that not quite here okay cool so do you guys know do you remember what a variable is so we've made a variable but you know why we use variable from why we have variable yes no is that saved into something yep pretty much so did that make them you've got to so did that make sense to you David why we use variables yeah Adam you've done okay so now what we need to do is we need to do one more thing because do you remember how last week when we saved whatever the end was from this input thing into a variable it saved it as a string we want to make sure it's saved as a number or as an integer so what we need to do is we need to save this answer but convert it into an integer so do you remember how we did this line of code which was like int and in the brackets and then something inside oh yeah yep so we want to put it in front of this so type in the word int and then put one bracket like the opening bracket before the word input and then the closing bracket next to that other bracket on the end yep so what this is doing is it saving whatever the input is whatever the person typed in as an integer as a number and we're saving the whole thing into a variable called sides so does that make sense ever yep yep yeah yeah okay so I'll just get you guys to run it just to check that you don't have any errors or anything okay mmhmm so it should still just ask you how many sides will the shape have and then it won't do anything after that but yeah just so it's working yep okay cool Justin did that work for you as well yeah it doesn't do anything but yeah yeah I think that's how it works as long as it doesn't give you any error like anything saying like trace back or something in red text then that's good okay wouldn't cool so now we'll go back to our code the next thing we want to do is let me run the program again so that you guys can see because we're drawing one shape but we keep drawing it over and over so let me so it's asking how many sides will the shape have and if I type in like five it's during a five sided shape five times so do you guys remember how to repeat bits of code we can use something like I can use something yep a look yeah yes so that's what we need to do we need to make something called a full loop so do you remember what the full lips do I think I repeat things that you want them to repeat four times yeah so it repeats whatever code like you want it to repeat however many times you tell it yeah well that's the second part say type in the word for oh yeah yep oh yeah they type in the word full and then you type in I so I is just kind of like we use it as like a counter to just count each step of the loop and then you type in in a yep so I am yeah in with something and then because we wanted to do something a certain amount of times so if a person types in three you want it to do it three times sometimes it five you want it to do it five times so what can we use that's in our code here that remembers what the user typed in what can we use as like a current counter the inch and yet the end but this side of the int so we want to use that variable cold sides the sides is whatever the user typed in like however many times aha yeah however much sides at once the drill which means however many times we want to draw a bat shape so go far I in but we want to type the word range and then type in sides brackets get brackets it's a range and then brackets side and then that colon thing to the dot two dots so do you guys remember what range does yep you think so what do you think it does David but that's okay so if I think it it like makes it like say and repeat yep kind of so it kind of its kind of the answers kind of in the word so it's like a range so it kind of gives you a range from one two and whatever number you put in here so we put inside so sides is a variable but it's counting a number so if the user types in five then it'll go like five times it's like one two three four five so it's just yeah basically saying the range of like one to five like to keep to make sure that it goes in the loop so now what we want to do is in the loop to make sure after you type in sides and then that I'll semicolon you press ENTER and then you should be tabbed in so you have a bit of space here yep so now we actually want to draw our we start drawing our shape so the first thing we want to do is we want to make it go forward a bit so what will we type in Oh food yep forward do we need anything else brackets maybe bracket yep we also might need this Bob got full and then put in the brackets and then we need to put a number in the bracket so I might just say a hundred or something cuz this number will always be the same because we just want all the sides to have the same length yeah so a hundred might be a good number we can change it later if we want but we'll see how it goes and now what we need to do is we need to turn because we need a draw go forward and then turn however many times to draw the next side of the shape but do you remember how we did that square activity a couple of lessons ago yeah yeah how many degrees that we have to turn for that square 90 90 yeah and do you know how you know that like how you got the number 90 yes because it's 90 degrees yeah but do you know why it's 90 degrees I'm not like a hundred degrees or something else like that is not because ninety degrees is like is like an angles at our kinks I can say take a manly shirt me and sure yeah you on unsure know you just change turns videochat on because all right okay yeah so basically because when we're drawing a square we have four sides so the angle needs to be divided by four full mm so if I just get up a calculator do you know how many degrees there isn't a full circle does anyone know how many degrees so if you want to like turn completely do you know how many degrees it is so like if 90 is up there puttan Oh like 360 is that what you said yep so it is 360 so like with the square we want to like turn an equal amount of times and we know that there's four sides with a square so if you type in 360 divided by four you get 90 so that's why it's 90 degrees when we turn each side to draw a square and then if it's like a triangle or something you can go 360 divided by three cuz triangles have three sides when you get a hundred and twenty yep so that's how it divided like calculate how many sides we want to turn but in our program we don't know how many sides the shape will have until the person tells us how many sides it will have so what we need to do underneath here so back up here then underneath side we want to make another variable called angle hey Angie a little equals and this variable will calculate how many cows all we need a turn to draw the shape to drill whatever shape the person is telling us to drill so does that make sense so like because we don't know like we don't know if we're making a square or triangle or what we have to do the calculation in the code over here so we have to say angle equals 360 and then does anyone remember what the / sign is on a computer yes yes which one is it it's that good hold it you're kind of looking called it so that's the star thing is x so oh yes oh yeah so it's like it's social no looking thing is many times the yeah they're like starting like near the number eight yeah so that's times but to divide by Alban on number nine oh okay on my one it's on number eight but it might be different yeah so what we want to do is we want to say 360 divided by the number of sides so what do we need to put in here after the divided by seven how like what can we use in our code that tells us the amount of sides this shape will have can anyone tell me so we need to go 360 divided by the amount of sides the shape will have so what's something that we saved in our code that remembers the amount of side the shape will have range close so it's in that range thing int yep the Imps but this side of the int again yes so we just want them we just want that variable names of sides so what this is saying is for example if it asks how many sides will the shape have and I type in five the next calculation will be 360 divided by five so then it already calculated that angle for us does that make sense yeah yep okay so now if we go back into our loop so if you just click at the end of this bob forward line and press enter make sure you are still in your loop so make sure you're still tabbed in by up now we actually want to turn our cursor like we want to turn turtle whatever angle this is so what line of code will we have to write angle almost so angle goes in the brackets do you know what we put the full the brackets so to turn to a side the turn left or right or left mmhmm yep Bob the less line yep Oh Bob the right so we'll use Bob left and then you have the brackets and then inside your brackets that's where you put angle so it's saying what this loop is saying is it saying for however many sides there is we want to move forward a hundred steps and then we want to turn left whatever angle it is and then move forward and then turn move forward turn so for example if we wanted to draw a square when we ran the program it would ask us how many sides will the shape have so we type in the number four and then what this loop here will do is it will do it will move forward 100 steps turn 90 degrees and then do that four times it's a battle drill square can you run it good enough so you can run it now and see what happens okay how many charge will our shape have for sure look it says so like can I just restart it yeah I'll just restart it and see you finish okay you can restart it and see if you get the error in chess the videos work yeah yeah you got an air as well okay yeah everyone oh okay what yeah I'll go one at a time so David do you wanna read out your error or doing what does your essay actually I'll get you to share your screen so I'll stop sharing mine so could you please share your screen oh yeah sure sure so I think yep my possum screen is it so okay so you actually day doesn't it doesn't sure yet you might need to share this our cell screen screen yes a screen sure cool there so this is my turtle and here's my error every name is not defined oh that's fine I can't see it thank you so if you go back into your code so it's saying name error the name angle is not defined so that means if we look back at your code it can't find like a variable called angle so you might as well sit oh yeah so you used angle down there in the me dot left but if you go up you see on the sides you have the word like the letters a GE le it's a better meant to say angle so that's us like setting up the variable angle and then yeah I think I just right yep so Chester was your arrow something different Chester gonna do you wanna share your screen so that I can see what how are you opening yeah I did it you did it and it did it work David yeah yep okay cool you can while you're waiting like test it with like different numbers like three or five or whatever and see the different shapes it can make oh I think you can make any different shapes just see kid is just gonna draw a square if I do ten Oh so you can try than see okay so it doesn't do square that's nice so I'm gonna do a thousand so Chester and that era you're getting is it's saying name forward is not defined so if you go into your code do you see how you just have the word forward and brackets a hundred yeah you have to write Bob dot forward so that it knows like because the dot forward function is part of the turtle thing and Bob is our turtle because otherwise yeah you have to type in the word Bob Wow yep now try it Chester pretty big shape hmm yeah so when you do a hundred mmhmm it does a circle a really big circle so you can see it yeah so I'll just do ten is a really good shape and let me try sir Tate yeah search is still out uh yeah that's right yes our 10 is average the average okay what we can do is we can actually do you see how when we run our program the cursor starts in the middle of the screen you can actually make it like go down a bit so that it starts like on the bottom left or something on the bottom so that it has more space to draw the shape so we can make it move down so I'll show you guys how to do that yeah um so let me share my screen so can everyone see my screen again yep yep okay so what we want to do before all this I'll do it down here unchanged this thing 290 shape oh cool that's pretty cool yep so what we want to do is right underneath way type bub is equal to turtle turtle we want to move before like starting anything we just want to move the cursor down to the bottom of it so we want to make it go down a bit so to do that we first have to face the bottom so does anyone know what angle like how much we might need a turn I think it's so it's I think no so I think Chester was on the right track wet so if 90 is like that we want to go 90 like 3 times 1 2 3 yes so it's 120 120 so I know it's actually so if you type in 90 plus 90 plus 90 I think it's 270 oh that's 270 so we want to turn to the left 270 degrees so just type in Bob dot left and then 270 so that just faces it down but now we actually want to make it move down a bit so now we can go bulk forward to make it go straight and then I might go 150 when I might even go 200 so that so it starts in the middle but we faced it down and we went down 200 and then what we want to do is we just want to make sure that it starts back at this point here because this is where it normally starts so we just want to turn left one more time because right now we're facing this way you want to turn that 90 degrees Bob your left mmhmm and then how much degrees not yep yep because we went like three 90s we want to just got one more 90 to bring it back yep so oh but you guys just quickly run that it might drill a line but I'll show you how to get rid of that also okay let's see but it should be like now before you it asks a question it should the cursor should have drawn a line down and then it's on the bottom yep but do you see how I drew a line we don't want you draw a line but um I'm actually okay was it because it looks kind of cute oh it was kind of cute okay yeah cuz then you can draw your shapes but I'll show you guys how to do it without a line so if you want the line there you can keep it but I'll just show you how to do it without so if you just close just again and go back to your code there's something called pen up and pinned down with turtle so what that means is if you put the pen up then if you stop drawing and then if you put the pen down you start drawing again so before we go down like before we draw that line that goes down we want to put the up so what we do is with a bob dot P and you saw a pen up so what this line of code does is it means we're telling it stop drawing and it still moves but it's not drawing anything on the screen does that make sense so far David and Chester yep yep so then what we want to do after we've moved down because we want it to draw off that we put the pen down there we go Bob don't pin down yep so what it's saying is don't draw anything and we just want to move down and face this way and now start drawing so you can run that and see what happens how do you get it to like do what you did so like this thing to move to the bottom all you mean like the extra shape things yeah yeah we'll do that next so if you just read it worked it was yeah so if you just run a bit of code to see if it works so we were just moving the cursor down a bit I don't mind being like I don't mind it being okay you don't mind it being upwards okay well that's okay as long as you understand do you understand how to just make the cursor moves to a different spot without having it draw yeah does it make sense okay so now we'll go on to the next bit of the program cuz right now it just drools like one shape but we want it to make like a cool pattern like shape yeah so I'm just going to show you guys something for now I might do it in a new Python thing so right now we have one loop like one full loop but what you can do is you can have a full loop inside another full so I'll show it so that it makes sense there your finish my thousand fitness it cool yeah I finished my shares and it was really long that's really long okay so what I'm doing is I'm just making another file just to quickly show you guys what a full loop looks like and then what a full loop inside another full loop looks like so that's called a nested loop so for example if we go for I in range full well don't forward 10 so I'll show you what this the distance and then I'll show you what it does with them not the loop inside it so how sorry what were you saying Justin I made two million two million well that's all just gonna take you like forever yeah that's gonna be a long line so with this with this code that I have on my screen right now how many pixels will bub move can anyone tell me so sure and so you can just look on my screen for now so I just want everyone looking on my screen for now yeah so with this like bit of code that I have here how many pixels do you think Bob will move so if like 10 is pixels 10 pixels how far do you think it will go so it's in a loop with the range of 4 so we'll go 40 pictures yeah exactly so it will go 40 pixels but if we this so inside that loop if I have another loop do you know how many pixels it will move now can anyone tell me I'll have the yes I think I do yep so you can just guess it's gonna be 80 pixels 80 pixels or just I told you almost not exactly a B so I'll quickly explain it so 81 if a bit more than 80 so when we just have one loop moving forward 10 pickles we repeat that four times so that becomes four new pixels when we have two loops like the code does this line of code then it does this then when it reaches the loop it does the one inside like the inside most loop first so it does this four times so that means it's moved 40 pixels and then it goes back and does this outside loop so it moves 40 pixels four times plus another 10 pixels out there I'll show you how it looks that it makes a bit of sense nested so what it does is it like runs the whole way and does the inner loop first so okay I'll show you what it does with that this is how much Bob moves when you have like a loop inside a loop that's moving ten and then this is how much Bob would move if it was just for any pencils so do you see how the line is so much smaller yep so it kind of does like I'm pretty sure it does so usually with one loop it would do 40 but we're doing that one loop again another 40 times so it's like 40 times not 40 40 times 4 which is 160 but we also have where did it go we also have this thing that happens so that's another 40 pixels added on that so it makes it 200 pixels it's a bit confusing but does it kind of make sense to you guys yeah yeah does it make sense to you David so it's a bit confusing but like I'll show you again if I run it so this is just one loop and we're making Bob move forward 10 pixels so it just moves this much which is 40 pixels but if we put that inside another loop I'm just gonna take away this line because that's a bit confusing so we're putting this in another loop we run it and then it does a bigger line so what that is doing is because it's a loop inside of a loop it does this 40 bit first because you know 4 times 10 is 40 10 20 30 40 so it does this little one first and then it does the big one so it goes like forty times four and that's how we get 160 and we get that bigger line does that kind of make sense yeah bit confused let's try do another example um so we'll just do it with a variable so we'll go X is equal to zero so X is just a little counter we're making so if we go X is equal to X plus one and then inside here we go X is equal to X plus one can someone try have a guesses what X will be at the end of this so X starts at 0 and then this just means add one on to whatever X is 8 8 so David do you have a guess what one it might be I think it's gonna be two okay George X so let me explain it like step by step so at the beginning X is zero so it's like starts at zero and now we have this loop which is saying like repeat it four times and all this line of code is saying is it's just saying X like add one on to X shall we start here X is zero by the time we get to this line X is now 1 and now when we get into this loop it's saying repeat this bit four times again so now we repeat it so X is now we will feed it four times so we add on four there we go X is now two three four five and now we do this again X is mount one like we add one on so it's six again and then we get to this line and then you repeat it four times let me go back to the outer one and do each step and then go in here and then you do this step so you kind of have to start with the outside loop and then do the inside loop first so I'm gonna get rid of this line because it might be a bit confusing first but okay if you saw this bit of code what do you think X will be here cool yep exactly it will be full but now if we put that loop inside another loop so this little bit means X is four but we have to do this little bit four times again because it's in another loop so if we're doing this little bit of code four times again what number will it be can anyone tell me so let me get rid of this again so you guys you on all times yeah eight so it would be four times four so that won't be a that will be 16 pretty sure so we can get a calculator up to check so we go full time full and it's 16 yep so I'll go through it again with a different number so if we just have this loop it will be full does that make sense to everyone why it's full yeah yeah yeah okay so now if we put this loop so this is already a loop if we put it in another loop but this time if I make it 5 we need to have whatever so this is repeating five times again so the answer for this is full but we need to repeat this whole block of code five times again so do you know what the answer would be mmm no not really not really so if you exactly so it will be four times five which makes X at the end of it 20 so the reason for that is this little bit of code here it makes like it repeats at four times so it just means X is full and then this what this code is doing is it's telling us to repeat this whole block of code another five times so a four times five equals 20 so this is kind of the same as saying X is equal to X plus full thread David if you saw this bit of code what do you think the answer would be like what would X be at the end of it you know so X starts at zero and then we're just adding full on to whatever X is so X is equal to four and then eight but we repeat that five times so it's full times five which means it's 20 yes so this is the same as doing this kind of doing it like in a bit of a different way but basically when you put a like full loop inside another loop let's go the nested loop it does like it repeats the calculation like it repeats the inner loop first and then it goes back and does the outer loop and repeats the inner loop again yeah okay so it kind of like it does this loop however many times you tell it in here but then whatever the answer is from that loop it does it this many times so this loop it's just adding one on to X so X is equal to zero now it's equal to one then you loop again to three pull and then it's four so then you repeat whatever the answer was for five times so if I change the number like if this was tooth does anyone know what the answer might be so you first calculate the smaller loop what's the answer of this so this inner loop runs four times so adding one or two X we get one two three four and now the outer loop runs two times so you get this calculation which is full and we time we do it twice so every times a by 2 so 4 plus four is equal to eight yeah yes does it kind of make sense it's a bit confusing but we'll go over it next lesson again because we just need to add like a little bit too I'll program but right now it's the end of the lesson so did apart from this did anyone have any other questions no not really ok so yeah next week we'll like go over this like nested loop thing again but we'll add it into our program so that it draws the cool shapes instead of just drawing the shape once yep does that sound good tipper yeah yep okay well then I'll see you next week
