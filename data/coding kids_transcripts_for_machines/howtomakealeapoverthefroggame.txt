welcome to coding kids today I'm going to show you how to build this game leap over the Frog first let's look at how we play it the player controls the cat by pressing the space key to make the cat jump the aim of the game is to avoid the Frog for as long as you can if you touch the Frog it is game over otherwise you can play the game forever now let's build the game there are four parts to the game won the game backdrop to the cat three the frog and four game over I will build this game one step at a time first let's start with a brand new project by clicking on the create button on the home page as you can see a new project starts with the cat sprite as a default the sprite is the character or object that we use in making the computer program for step one let's add the backdrop by clicking on the miniature backdrop icon on the bottom left of the screen then scroll down until you find a backdrop that you like you may choose to use a different backdrop to me double click on the backdrop that you have selected or click on the backdrop then click the ok' button for step two let's program the cat so that it jumps when we press the space key click on the cat sprite and then click on the scripts tab at the top center to activate the cat when we press the space key we will need an events block in the event block category we can find a block that says when space key pressed let's drag this block into the workspace to make the cat jump we need to get the cat to start at the bottom of the screen then glide upwards then glide downwards back to its original position let's locate the cat in a position at the bottom of the screen using a go to block which you can find under motion for example at x equals zero and y equals minus 60 let's use to glide blocks one to glide upwards to x equals zero and y equals 150 and then the second glide block to return to x equals zero and y equals minus 60 now I'm at step three I will select a new sprite from the sprite library oscillate the Frog sprite I want the Frog to start at the right side of the screen glide to the left stop start again at the right side of the screen and repeat until game over first let's program the Frog to start at the right side of the screen I'll use the goto block to do that with the coordinates of x equals 270 and y equals minus 80 you can find the goto block under the motion category with this one block in the workspace by itself if you click on the block the code runs so move the Frog to the top of the screen then click on the block to see it work we won the scratch program to activate this code at the start of the game we start the game by clicking on the green flag let's find an events block that does just that here is the when green flag clicked block we stack this when green flag clicked block on top of the goto block like Lego bricks now let's move the Frog to the top of the screen and then click on the green flag it works now I want the Frog to glide to the left side of the screen so I'll go to the motion category and drag over the glide block and stick it under the goto block I want the Frog to glide to the left the leftmost point on the stage is an x coordinate of negative 240 so I'll make the coordinates on the glide block x equals minus 240 and y equals minus 80 let's click on the green flag and test the code it works now we want the Frog to do this forever let's grab the forever block which I can find in controls hover the forever block of the goto and fly blocks so that it looks like the forever block is about to eat the two motion blocks then let go let's click on the green flag and test the code it works have a look at your frog is it too fast or too slow how will you go playing with it what can you do to slow it down there are two ways you can tweak the frogs movement change the number of seconds in the glide block and you can add a wait block which you can find in controls you can see that when the Frog and the cat touch nothing happens so now I will code up the game over part of the game first let's click on the miniature of the backdrop brick wall then click on the backdrop tab at the top center of the screen delete the blank backdrop duplicate the brick wall backdrop or the backdrop you selected add text by clicking on the text icon which looks like a letter T type game over over the backdrop rename the backdrop from brick world to game over now we need to go back to the cat to add the code to trigger game over what we want to happen is when the cat touches the Frog the backdrop changes to the game over backdrop and the scripts stop running we do this by getting an if block and a touching block we put the touching block into the gap in the if block we click on the drop down menu and select frog so now the codes say if touching frog then when this happens we want to change the backdrop and stop the scripts we go to the looks category and pick the Switchback drop block and place it into the if block we click on the drop down menu and to make sure that we have selected the game over backdrop next we go to controls to get the stop all block to stop the scripts at game over let's click on the green flag hmm why isn't the game switching to game over when the cat touches the Frog let's look at the script when green flag clicked we are checking to see if the cat is touching the Frog but when do we want to check this we actually want to check if the cat is touching the Frog all the time we want the program to do this check forever so let's put all of this in a forever block which we can find in control now let's click on the green flag to test our game great it works add your own features to personalize the game perhaps add a score or number of lives or a timer
