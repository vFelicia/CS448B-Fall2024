which is me so let me know when you can see my screen I can see it now you can see of it can you still see your screen as well yep yep okay so what we'll do is we'll quickly I think you did last week but we'll quickly just go over making a new Python file just to refresh your memory and then we'll start on the actual project so do you remember how to make the new Python file once you've had idle open yes yep okay so how do you do it so you go into file in click new file and then do you remember how to I am yep that's correct so you go file and then new file and then so you can see the difference between the file and the shell because the file is just plain hi David can you hear me okay hello hello can everyone hear me yeah okay cool and so we just started um so if you can open up Idol please yep and then we were just going over how to make a new file so I think the internet connections a bit slow so I'll just speak a bit slowly because I think it's lagging a tiny bit yep okay so Chester has already done this but once you have Idol open to make a new file you just click file and then click the button this that says new file and then you should get the this blank screen so let me know when both of you are up to this step it's a bit slow so I'm just gonna wait a couple of seconds to see if it's lagging you still hear me David yeah um do you think you could speak a bit closer to the mic please you're quite soft okay yeah that's right so do you have the new file you have Idol open yep okay so I'll just quickly go over again the difference between a Python shell and the actual file is the shell looks like this with the three arrows and then the file is just blank and then the shell does things line by line so the first one shows you show you how to what to do this path in those words on the top and if you open a new file it means you already know how to do everything and you can do it on your own booze answer yeah yeah pretty much yes so like the first one with the shell like it only does stuff line by line but like you said when you know how to do the things you can go straightaway to your file and then save it and run it yourself and you can always come back to this file so I'll just quickly we went over this but I'll just quickly do like a little test program so that you know how to save it and run it because we went over it last week but it was towards the end so do you remember how to print something onto the screen yeah yep so we'll just do one line that says print and then remember if it's a word what do you need to put the word in so if it's a string how do you have to type it you forgot that's okay so you have to put it in quotation marks so either double ones or the single ones yep so you can just say something like hello world and so this is just really short just to test to see if it works so now to run it you can click run on the top and then run module or you can press f5 on your keyboard so it's the same thing yep and then it'll first ask you to save it so every time before you run it it will ask you to save it so you press ok ok and then you just choose where you want to save it so if you it might be good to have like a folder with all your Python projects from this commercial script scripts or not scripts may be like on your computer somewhere umm no I'll do Scrooge ok scripts just somewhere you know where you can find it later on so actually it's it's better to do it out of this folder because this folder is where like the Python installing stuff is it's better to save your own cycle project somewhere else so Chester I was just going over how to save a Python project do you remember how we did it last week No ok that's ok so what all I did was in that new file let me just close this in that new file just to test that it's working we just wrote print and then HelloWorld so do that on your new file as well so just one line of code to write something on the screen yes so David generally it's better not to save it in that scripts file because all those folders are part of the Python package which users like which is how you install and use idle so it's better to save it in a different folder yeah sure can yep and Chester do you remember why we have these quotation marks if it's held the computer right printed yeah yeah so the those quotation marks means it's a string so it means it's just the word so yes and then once you've done that we wanted to try test it like by running it so let me know when you've done it you've done it yeah I do and yes sorry what did you say yeah god yep okay both of you have done it so then we just want to click run on the top and then run module and this is where I was telling you David you have to save it so Chester every time before you run your Python program it has to save you just press ok and then choose somewhere where to save it on so don't save it in this pipe then folder where it has like represent stuff because that's part of like the package which kind of installs and runs Python so if you save it they might get a bit confused so try save it somewhere in your computer like desktop or documents or something and create a folder if you want so I meant put it in documents and just go new folder projects and then every time whenever you have a Python project that you're saving it's always good to give it a meaningful name so what I mean by meaningful is just some name that you know what is in that program so like you know how sometimes things might be saved untitled one two three that's not a meaningful name because we might not know what that program does the for example we could right here test print program or something because that something that you will know what the program does and once you've chosen a spot and given it a name just press save and then your shell should pop up and then it should say what your print statement so in this case it should say hello world and on the top here just above that line it says where it's saved like it's telling you which file it's running so let me know if that works everyone okay good it work yep cool I think Chester's internet might be a bit slow so wait a couple of seconds and see okay Chester can you hear me again so just on what I said before was just when you press run and once you've saved it um a Python shell should pop up with the program yep so did it work for you yeah yep okay cool and I'll quickly show you another thing so like you can close the Python shell keep your file open so when you have a file it means you can always go back and edit it but another thing before doing that I'll quickly show you is there something called or autocomplete in idle so for example if you're writing a function say you're trying to write that print function but you forgot what exactly the word is like you could start writing PR and then if you press tab on your keyboard you might get a little drop down or if tab doesn't work try press ctrl and the space button or if you have a Mac command and its face button and you should have a dropdown with different options did that work do either of them work for you guys yep so are you guys both using Windows or using Mac or what kind of comm using Windows you're using Windows a vehicle and David okay that's cool so that's the same as me so then you would just go tab door control space and then it will try to finish off what you are typing and then I think if you just press space it finishes off the word so that's pretty handy if you forget what exactly it is or how to spell it and you can finish like the rest of the stuff yeah so then I'll just get you guys to save it and run it again just to test it and since you saved it once it should automatically save it next time you run it and just straightaway run your program so did that work as well yeah so just check so generally whenever you are doing a program so this one's pretty simple it's just printing two lines but generally when you're doing a program it's always good to test it every now and then to see if it's running so every time you make a change it's good to run it so that you can see that it's working like it's mental like you can put a bit to work so sometimes if you have a small error and then you try to do a whole bunch of like like a lot of lines of code and then try to run it you might get an error and then you wouldn't know where the error is run it after every little bit of code you write and if you do can error you know oh it's the last thing I wrote oh yes it's what I did when there was an error in my in my script I just I didn't do anything I just did a new page uhhuh and you paid yeah yeah yes so sometimes like arrows can be sneaky and you don't know where they are which is why it's good to always do that so one more thing I'll quickly show you guys before we start on with the lesson so I'll get you guys to close both the Python shell on your actual file but just remember where you save that Python file so I'll show you how to open it again so pretend it's a new day and like you're done like if you want to start working on the same file again what you need to do is you need to find where it is to find the folder and then find which file you saved should let me know when you guys have found it I found it you found it ethical David do you find it oh yes yep okay so once you have the file once you can see your file you just need to rightclick on it and then you should be able to see make sure you click on the file and then rightclick you should be able to see something saying edit with idle do you see it you go yep so click that click edit with idle and then it should open up your file again might take a couple of seconds to load so now you can go back and add more to your file or edit stuff in your file and just run it the same way Chester did you managed to open yours as well no okay so what do you see when you rightclick on your file on the program right do you just see something that says like you saw it by group by what do you see like a clip don't like it like clicked on the file they might like thinks I want to change the name okay so you might have double clicked on it accidentally because generally if you double click on it it tries like if you double click on the name it thinks you want to try change your name so try click a bit away from the name like next I like that you tried that too so make sure I using a mouse or just the mouse keyboard okay so make sure the right click is the other click so you first click on it normally and then click on it is it still trying to rename it yeah yeah okay um do you want to quickly share screen I'll stop sharing mine and you can you can show you this so David while you wait if you want you can try add a couple of things to that test file if you want like based on what we learnt in the last couple of weeks sure why not yep okay so hmm and now if you right click okay hmm okay so maybe yours works a bit differently but if you just unlike click out of it again sorry and then just click on it once and without rightclicking on the top do you see how there's a few buttons there like organize oakland share with click on open but maybe yes we'll see if they're open to otherwise click on the arrow next to open try choose a default so python might put some Python it might try to open it and run it so maybe click on that choose default program and see you can try find idle otherwise I'll show you another way so if you just close that so another thing you can do is if you just open up idle just a new one instead of going file new file you can just go file open click on and now you can go find where you saved it again so David another way of opening the file is by opening idle and just clicking on file and open yep and now if you click on that and then press that button open on the bottom sorry yeah yeah yeah sorry it could be must be your settings for right click it's a bit different to mine but yeah so you can just do it this way Chester it is about the same way but yeah I'm gonna start sharing my screen again so we don't actually need this test print program again so because we're gonna work on something else now that was just to test saving it and uhm you think running the file so if you want you can either create a new file now and just keep that one or you can edit this file so I'm just gonna make a new file so what we're going to do today is something called full loops and we're going to revise a bit of what we did last week with turtle as well yeah okay yep so oh well last week we didn't do much of anything oh yes I think David you a bit late last week so you missed the first bit of it yeah last week I couldn't okay yes we're going to go through something called turtle I'll try briefly like go over it again for you and if you have any questions just ask but just make sure you have a new file open or if you're using the other file just delete the other stuff in it for now so Chester do you remember a bit of turtle yeah yep okay so just quickly do a quickly explain to David what cover is like what we use it for it's turtle is like something that you start drawing yeah yeah so turtle is something called the library in Python a library is just a whole bunch of code that someone else has written which we can use so we use turtle to draw things on the screen yeah yeah so the first thing we need to do remember what the first thing we need to do is Chester if we want to use harden it so David we need to do is type the word input and type the word turtle all in lowercase so what that is doing is we're importing the library called turtle because we didn't write that code someone else did we have to import it so that we can use the things in turtle okay yep so what we'll do is we'll draw a little square with turtles the next thing you need to do do you remember what it is just so it I just okay yeah I'm gonna use Bob it's a David now what we need to do is we kind of need to make something a bit like a variable which is like what our turtle will be yeah well okay so don't cuddle with an uppercase hey yep good job and then in brackets yep good job yep so both oh sorry David what you need a touch is the word like a name for your turtle equal and then we use turtle with the lowercase because that's saying we're using something from that turtle library the thing we just imported so turtle with the lowercase and then dot title with uppercase yep so the uppercase not all kind of means like a turtle object so when we Bob into a turtle which can like move and draw onto the screen so look quickly so if you haven't saved it already because a new file will save it otherwise just straight away run it and you can see what happens so I'm just gonna quickly save mine what does a turtle do so something just appeared in my screen it was turtle graphics yep so turtle graphics thing which allows us to draw on the screen like lines and circles so I'll show you that's the thing but yeah so it's kind of like like painters but you can't do it automatically the turtle is Bob and what does Eddie do we just give it a name yes then we can control it later so that's the next step but I'll just show you so I'm gonna call this Tuttle loop because later on we're going to use something called four loops okay so what you would have seen David is the graphics thing that opened and then do you see that little arrow there that's our turtle which we can move around and make it draw on the screen so that's the thing we call Bob oh yeah and how do we move it around yeah so that's what we're gonna do now okay we'll just close this so what we'll do is we'll quickly we'll do a quick a small square so Chester do you remember what we might need to do to draw a square yeah yep so what's the first thing yep so David yep um the name we gave which yep and then we add the word for word so Ford is kind of like an inbuilt function in that turtle library but but who didn't tap it in so just you're just I'm so sorry what did you say Dave oh okay Chester sorry did you say something no I'm just doing like a small square as well yeah the numbers tiny okay yep 90 90 okay that's a pretty good size I think yep so David forward is like a function which that turtle library has and because we already made a turtle object dot forward is like part of Bob so our telling Bob to move forward and yes your brackets we need to tell it how much to move forward okay pretty sure to fix those yes so you can try 90 so 90 so it's kind of like steps but I think it's in pixels label do it I do next so if you want how it works yeah yeah yes yep so if you want to see how it works just run it and Chester you can test it it's working and it should have run in a straight line oh yeah okay just good yep so if you want because we're making a square if you want it to be a bit bigger you can change that number 90 to be a bigger number if you want it to be smaller you can change it to be a smaller number oh yeah like like 100 no that would be too small like 100 folds and turn right then a hundred fools and turn right again so it took the censer right so instead of turn right there's another thing we can use so Chester do you remember what it is harden do you remember how we make the turtle turn do you remember yeah you go so what do we need a type oh don't laugh and brackets and then the brackets like however like whatever degree angle um it's a time yep exactly yeah you knew that yeah so like if you saw when you ran your program you would have seen like your turtle was facing that way to the right so if we go Bob left if you want it to face up it's all based on degrees so do you know how many degrees we need to change it to face up I think I do so what do you think it is it's George 90 degrees or 100 and sure no sir iein okay 90 yeah you all right yeah because it was already facing this way so we just want to move it to the left 90 degrees yeah okay yeah and then you can run it again and see what happens so I'm gonna make a smaller square so I just changed my forward to 50 so it might have not have it wouldn't have drawn the line yet but you can see that it changed to face up David do you see how it's facing off now so now you can continue it and make it go forward and left and try to ask with okay so if you want to do a square how many times do you have to repeat it so how many sides would it have can't anyone tell me so how many sides is a yep cool so you want to go forward turn forward turn forward ten but done so you can just copy and paste it if it's easier so sometimes if you want to do like fancy shapes like a house or something it might be like good to plan it out on a piece of paper how you might draw it so for example if you're drawing a square you can plan out like how much which ways you have to turn and things like that yeah yeah but this is like a squares relatively simple so it's pretty much the same lines yeah so once you've done that try run it and see what happens I'll just write a square you made a square cool do it what yeah yep good job hey David did you make the square yes yep and did it work okay yeah and did it make sense to you yes yeah okay that's good so I'll we did this last week but I'll just quickly tell you there's you can also change like the size of the pen and the color of the pen in turtle and you can also change like what your cursor looks like so I'll quickly show you that so Chester do you remember what we might type in to change one of those things well don't shape yep abduct shape and brackets what shape you want yes so we can go bub dot shape and then we can type the word turtle if we want it to be a turtle shape so David there's like a few sets like set of shapes that Python knows so you have to use those shapes like if I typed in the word a polite not know if that is a shape so we might get an error so if you wanted to find what the shapes where I can use this you can go into Google and type in like Python turtle okay oh yeah okay and then that first result which is like duck stock Python is where you can find the answers to that and then I won't go through the color and size thing now because we did it last week but if you wanted to know how to change it you can go python turtle sub pen size so it's generally like bob dunne pen size or bob dot color and then you put in the color but to know what size need is pardon a few days ago yeah i'm tired on paper and i like to get the turtle up and i get the turtle graphics up yeah and draw a square yeah that's pretty cool so you wrote it on paper yeah so I was up to test your memory kind of so that you could just practice yeah okay that's a good idea yeah so sometimes it's good to like plan it on paper especially later on if you do really complicated projects it's good to plan out what steps you're doing and like you said on paper as well pretty good okay so just run it again if you made any changes just run it just to test that it's working okay and then I'll introduce something a new concept so check that you can still draw a square ah it's cool did you manage to change the look of it David uh way to shake good copy that's good okay so now what we'll do is we'll go back into our pile so do we do trial oh no so sorry we'll go back to that file where we were writing it so I'm going to explain the reading order to continue file oh yeah so whichever file you had your square on we're still gonna use the same file so make sure that's open yeah okay so I'm going to explain something called for loops has anyone heard of a for loop little huh no no that's okay have you heard of the loop in general like in programming it's okay if you haven't not quite sure that's okay so that's what we're gonna be learning now anyway so a loop basically allows us to repeat bits of code so in Python we can use a for loop to repeat a bit of code for example do you see how right now to make our square we have these two lines which we've repeated four times yeah so instead of so like that's quite a bit of code so if we wanted to make it more like shorter and kind of more efficient what we can do is we can just have we can delete those extra three bits and just keep it once and then we can put it in a loop so that it will repeat four times instead of having to like type those lines out four times does that idea kind of make sense yeah yep okay so I'll show you how to do it what would you type yes so I'll show you what to take so David does that concept make sense to you yeah okay yep okay so in Python to do a for loop we type the words for and then we type the word I so this letter I can is kind of like a variable so it can actually be anything like you could be like oh like you know Apple in something but generally in code like they use a as kind of like a counter so we'll just stick with I and we'll go for I in to the next thing you write is for I in and then we want to repeat it because it's a square how many times do we want to repeat that bit of code well well so to do four we type in the word range so in Python there's something called have you done it before did actually sorry what did you say I didn't he I said only deleted that file how you accidentally delete that file did you like delete the file or did you delete what's in the file because it's just I deleted are delicious a file but I can go again to poison yeah I'm on yeah cuz if you deleted what's in the file you can just click on do and it should appear again but otherwise quickly try you can see on my screen what's written so just try a copy that but yeah so to do the follow be right for I in range and then we do the brackets again and inside the brackets we want to say how many times you want to repeat it so if it's full will write for I in a range of full so that's pretty much saying repeat this four times and there's one more thing we need to do so in Python the like it likes spaces cuz right now we need to make sure that this bit of code is part of this fold because otherwise if you write stuff after it it might not know what's part of the full of and what's just meant to happen once so to do that you type in keep the bracket you type in colon like the two dots and press ENTER and you see how your cursor is kind of indented a bit so it's not at the very level and that's where you'd put your actual code so you can either press Delete to make that go forward or if you click on your line you can press tab to indent it in so like to push it in a bit so python is a bit picky about indentation and spaces so if you didn't have it it would tell you there's an so does that make sense yep yep okay so the reason why we indent it is like if I wanted to do some stuff afterwards like for example print a square something because I just want this thing to happen once so that's why it's back like to the very edge so that way our program knows only this stuff is meant to be repeated four times if this was indented as well then that would also be repeated every time but we just want to do it normally so we put it back on the edge does that make sense yep yep Chester does it make sense you too yep yep so now what you can do is you can run it and see what happens so run run module and it should do the same thing so did you loose what did it still do ask where does it look the same as the square you had before yep okay okay chest up does go so up as well okay so when you actually run it it should look any different it's just when you look at the code you can see yep Cheston did you try running it now and see what happens was it still loading Chester did you as well yep did it well that's good not quite sure okay when you was I do then and then I made it say print something yeah oh so the print thing okay so the print thing if you have your shell open it says the print on a different place so turtle does all that stuff in this thing called Python turtle graphics that's because we're just drawing lines and shapes and stuff but if you use like that print statement it'll do it how we normally do it you know how in our first program it had print hello world something it will just appear in this Python shell here so do you see that Python shell so like it will print the word in your Python graphics window do you see where it's written just hang on I think it's a bit laggy I'll just wait a couple of seconds so David while you're waiting you can try change the color of the pen and things like that so to change the color of the pen yep I'll just quickly explain it before chester comes and you can go like bob dark color but type in the world color with without the you because they spell it like the American Way you're inside that color inside the brackets in quotation marks you want to say a color like green or something so again if you want to see exactly what color choices they have you can go onto that website and type in like python python turtle colors but generally they have standard ones green blue red and stuff like that yeah okay just I was just quickly explaining to David how to change a color of the pen but what we using about your project it'll happen so I did lunch then then I did try to make it do a shape but didn't walk didn't yet and did it come up with an error yeah yeah okay so do you want to share your screen so I can see what's happening so David if you've tried the color things try changing the size of the pen so try gone to that website I told you and see what happens yeah okay so do you mind opening have you been doing this in your file chest or have you been doing it in the Python shell it might be easier to type it in because when you do it in the Python shell you have to do it line by line so do you wanna maybe quickly go and open a new file but don't close this shell because then you can see what's written down because it's just easier to type out like when you're doing lots of bits of text because the Python shell is good like when you're doing like a couple of lines but sometimes it's easier to set it out especially because of the spacing but one issue I can see is you have the Bob forward and then right next to it you have Bob left but that should be in a new line I think that's the error that's coming up so it says invalid syntax which means like something the way you typed it is wrong so yeah it's just that you have the Bob left right next to the forward thing but yeah so it might be easy if you just quickly type it in this file so you can set it out nicely so we're using turtle so you go to import turtle and then you have to make your little bug turtle so daven did you figure out how to change the size of the pen did it work yes yep okay that's good yeah so you can make it like I think there's a range of numbers from one to ten I think and then did you test it and see if it worked as well and now what you want to do Chester is you want to type in that for loop so we want to repeat it four times so you type in yep what you wrote there so for I in range full mmm then press ENTER and now it's indented so now to do the square what two lines you need to do I think he's dropping out again oh I'm dropping out maybe so chest up to do the square you just need your two lines again and then in the new line so you press and take in and then you do Bob Douglas so the error you had this all was just that it will they were right next to each other but it's like a new command it's like a new kind of step so you have to do it in in you also to actually click on that order correct thing I think you just press space it automatically fills it out and left up 90 I'm sorry brackets 90 and then if you wanted to do your print thing if you wanted to print something once where would you put it like at the end if you wanted to say the squares done or something yeah where would you type it so you can or not there so what do you think would happen if you don't have it there yep yeah so David and did that make sense to you as well so anything that's indented after that for loop would be repeated four times so if you wanted to do something once like later on like what Chester's doing with this print statement you you'd press backspace so that you're back in the edge again yes yep so we'll just see if this works and after that I'll quickly show you guys so you know mmhmm so then try run that chest there and see what happens and yep just press okay oh yeah so this is a new file so you would just need to save it again and don't forget to give it a meaningful name so because we're using a loop here you could call it like that little for loop or something so again whenever you have like variables or whenever you have to name something when you're programming always give it meaningful names because sometimes if I have a really complicated program or like a lot of files if you have like names like you know file one five two two five three you wouldn't know what's what and then you they like try going to everyone to figure out what it's doing yep and then just to just save that cool so the square works and then the print function do you see it betting your Python shell it says Marcella yeah yep okay I'm gonna share my screen again really quickly sure so I'm just gonna quickly show you guys something yeah so if we sir can you see my screen again yeah yep okay so if I had something like this do you see my full loop right now if I was trying to draw a square and then I had this one or this one what's the difference between these two for loops like the first one and the second one which one would draw the square so the difference between these can anyone see a difference did they look the same yes yes they look the same to you as well yes all right so the fiction is this bob left so if I run it I'll show you oh yeah see yeah you see it now so what it's meant to do what I want it to do is just draw like tooth where's but let's see what it actually does oh yeah yes I do once closed and the doors oh yeah you won big understand what you want yeah so the reason why is if we go back into the code so the first time it did the square correctly so it did that correctly but the second time I didn't get any errors but it still didn't do it how I said wanted it to does anyone wanna does anyone want to try of a guess why pendants because the left is not mine yeah exactly so even though it didn't get me an error like the program just thinks oh that's what I wanted to do I just wanted to do a line and the reason why it didn't get an error is because there was nothing wrong with the code it's just something wrong with the logic so what Chester was saying was right but this bobbed up left needs to be like indented in so if you want to indent something you can also just press tab so if I didn't have it indented did you see how it drew just like a long line yeah the reason for that is it just repeated this line bobbed up forward four times so it just went like 50 50 50 50 and then it turned once so that's why it ended up pointing upwards oh yeah okay so you have you have to say is that turn four times yeah four what's four times yep exactly so if we want it to always go straight and then turn we have to make sure that both things are in that loop does that make sense yeah yep okay cool now I'll give you guys a little challenge I want you guys to try have a go at doing different shapes like a hexagon or octagon or angle I think I'm gonna just pass on that because I said just try one of them okay so what should I do I'm gonna do a triangle okay try to triangle yes triangle is the easy you just remember you have to think about your angles as well and you have to think about how many sides a triangle have and how much you want it to turn so it's pretty similar to the square you just need to change a couple of numbers so do you guys have an idea on how you might start it yeah is that it yes or no yes yes okay yeah yep so if it's a triangle has anyone tried it out and seeing how it looks I did but it looks awful Oh what did it look like it looked like I don't know what you call that it looks like a cat a cat that was holding out an eye something in its paws that sounds pretty cool that sounds pretty cool but what doesn't look cool if you if you look at it it looks like I don't know like a Kraken mmhmm okay so chested did you try run it and see what happens now I'm trying it right now you're trying it right now okay after you try it um if we'll see how it goes otherwise I'll leave you guys a little hint yes great hmm what did yours turn out like Chester I'm doing the mortgage mmhmm are you bit stop just thinking just thinking okay so I'll give to David what did you write in your code all right oh but no import turtle turtle dot turtle George thingies yeah oh sorry I just meant the follow bit like the one we had before I didn't then Bob dot shape turtle yet for one in range three mmhmm Bob to turn turned 50 so you go Bob forward or did you Bob Bob Bob said Bob dot then Bob dot last 90 degrees okay so then I went Bob affords you know round bobbing 90 degrees right yes then a dead forward and for 150 and for fifties and I did fall I said I did right turn right 90 degrees attract my to make a Pentagon a Pentagon okay yeah so one reason is because one reason is in the fold it's meant to make it easier so what you need you just need the same three lines you had before you don't need anything extra and the only thing you would change is you had the first step right so for I in range three because the triangle has three sides you want to do it three times but a square has when we're doing a square we want to turn 90 degrees but if we're doing a triangle we want to turn 120 degrees so the reason for that is I'll quickly show you if you open up a calculator yes so how many two triangle pardon I created a triangle oh okay cool good job a wide one a wide one that's pretty cool yep so I'm quickly explaining today with the angle we have to turn is 120 the reason for that is we go 360 because 360 is a full circle and then a triangle has three sides so we go divided by 3 and that's 120 so each time we want to move forward a bit and I'm turn 120 move forward a bit more 120 go forward again 120 and then when you run it you should be able to see a triangle I did a world working outside just did did you just guess it left 45 three times other 45 oh yeah no I knew those Sid left not only left right it's 45 three times did you like write the code 310 that line of code three times yeah okay so you can do that but remember the loops make it easier so that you don't actually have to repeat that bit of code so do you remember how when we were making the square or even now when we're making a triangle it would mean we would have to repeat that bit of code two extra times but because of this loop it's really short and that's all the code we need to make a shape so that's actually the end of the lesson but did anyone have any questions okay cool if you want at home you can try make some other shapes but otherwise I'll see you guys next week yep bye
