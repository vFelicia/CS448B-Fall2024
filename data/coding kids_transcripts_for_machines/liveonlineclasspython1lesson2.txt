hmm and you might just see a little thing saying recording from the top yes yep okay so I might share my screen now and we'll get started okay so does everyone have idle open yeah yep okay cool so today we're gonna be playing around with something cold turtle so I don't know if you remember you know how last week I showed you some of the games where it draws stops yeah dream that's what uses turtle like that's how it draws the stuff on the screen it uses something called turtle so my dad told me about that oh really already that's good yeah so I'll just get it open and to show you an example again I think he uses it how he uses turtle like the dots you know if these actually our lesson ducks so it's just like whatever us shooters have access to oh because those are asset that we we can have a copy of that oh really yeah I'll double check with them and like I could get her to send it yeah because that's what I want to I want to do like what I want to know what we cover each lesson because right yep yeah intersects you're providing with the less than what we actually learn and cover so we we can we can crossreference it back if we let's say we want to this oh yeah yeah I'll message her and double check and then I'll get her to contact you and like just remind her to send that to you all right give me a second my computer's being a bit so okay well I'm waiting I'll just get Idol open is your idol open quarry and just doublecheck that you can see my screen and idle is well once and you'll I don't I mean I'm just gonna stop sharing and I'll just open it and share again cuz wasn't working properly so give me a second and I'll just show you the type of program you can make with cuddle again so let me just share my screen okay can you guys see my screen again yeah history yep okay cool so just keep idle open and I'll just quickly show you again what turtle does so you can do a few things with um turtle and Python but this is just an example of a program I showed you guys in the first week but I'll just show you again so you know what you're doing so it basically allows you to draw graphics on the screen so once this loads okay so this is where it asks how many shapes were how many sides will the shape have and if I just say cool it draws it on the screen so the thing like that hat is actually drawing the lines and stuff is something cold like it's using a library cold turtle and this is the kind of code but I'll just stop that for now and we'll actually get into it and then it'll make more sense so I might just okay can you guys see my screen in your screen okay yep it's the size affairs oh yeah yeah okay yep yep okay so yeah as I was saying before turtle is something called a library so has anyone heard of a library with programming languages no no okay that's okay so it's basically it's like a bunch of code that someone else has done and then we can use it so like they've already made some code that does different sort of stuff so in this case it drills things on the screen so they've done it and made it easy for us so all we need to do is just use like certain functions functions kind of just use bits of like other bits of code that are already set so we can use those functions to do things so it'll make a bit more sense when I when I show you so the fun I'd be practicing you've been practicing okay that's good have you been practicing with total at all no no okay that's okay so it's good to practice as well so I'll first introduce turtle and then we might use some of the stuff we did last week as well okay the first thing we need to do is whenever were using a library that is made like that's already made we have to import it so make sure you guys are just in Python shell right now yep yep so the ones with the three islands so you just need to type input turtle so what that does is it allows us so it imports everything we need to use this turtle library and then we can actually use the functions in it so if we didn't import it we wouldn't be able to use the things that make it draw on the screen so once you've done that line just press ENTER and then it doesn't look like it's done anything but that's okay it's done it in the background and now what we want is we want to create an actual turtle so a turtle is like this little cursor thing if you look back from the screen it's the cursor but sorry it's the cursor that actually drills stuff on the screen here so like right now it's just this little arrow so the turtle like we can make the turtle move up down and like change color and stuff but it's the main thing that controls the lines that were drawing so what we need to do is we need to actually make our turtle so we can give it a name so do you remember how last time we went into variables yeah it's a bit like a variable so what we're like I might so what do we go like total equals something yeah exactly but instead of turtle you can call it anything so you can call it turtle or you could call it like you could give it a name so like I make a bub is equal to so you can just give it any name and now what we need to do is we need to go turtle lowercase dot and then uppercase T u are key le so you might see some stuff as you're typing do you guys get a dropdown box as well wait so did you see the dropdown box really it doesn't show you that's okay it might come up if you press shift the as you're typing if you press shift on your keyboard oh sorry tab on your keyboard tap tab that's above don't make it total yeah so it like finishes off the word you're typing so that's another thing that Idol has here like it kind of knows some of the functions that you're trying to type so it'll try finish it off yeah gave me the right one any other way you do need to do yep so after if not you can always just type it you don't have to press tab and finish it off you can just type it yourself the tab thing just make sure like that use you've said like type the right word with the right spelling and stuff but it doesn't matter too much and then after this line you just want to put an open and close brackets good yep so what this is doing it's creating a variable called Bob and Bob is like it's kind of like a little robot that draws on the screen so that's using turtle so what it's doing is it's calling this method called turtle so a method if you hear me use the word method or function they're pretty much the same thing so it's pretty much like some code that was written somewhere else that you're reusing again that kind of makes it yeah yep so a library is like a whole bunch of code that we're taking from somewhere else so that might have lots of methods in it but a method is just one bit of code that does one thing so like in this case it's kind of just like setting up outer toe okay yeah okay so once you've done that just press ENTER and another screen might have opened up yeah yep so that's kind of like it like this unexpected indent unexpected indent so if you have a space somewhere an extra space at the end or maybe like in between the . no I don't need much space anywhere exactly how you typed it exactly how I type it okay maybe just try type it again and see so sometimes python is a bit picky and indent means like it's either been tabbed in a bit or like there's some space an issue that confuses just try type it again while we're waiting I'll just quickly send a message to the other students yeah yep okay cool so um I'll just quickly explain again the bob equals you guys get that right that's like the variable they're equal to and then the reason why we go turtle turtle is because this function turtle with the capital t yes from this library called turtle with your lowercase t so the dot just means like it's part of that we're using the function from that library if that kind of makes sense yeah yep okay so once you've typed that line of code you should get this window that is Python turtle graphics yeah this is where it'll actually draw the stuff so the little cursor like the arrow that you see yeah our turtle so that's a Bob or whatever you guys called yours so now we can actually make it do stuff like move around and draw on the screen if you go back into shell so don't close this window just go back into shell and what we can do is we can make Bob go forward so we can type Bob and then dot and then the word forward and then the circle brackets so open and close the brackets and then inside the brackets we can put a number so that just says like how much Bob should move forward so like I might put 10 I think I'm pretty sure that's in pixels so it will move 10 pixels so you could make it a bigger number like 100 or 50 or something it's up to you so basically okay the number it just determines like how long you want it to go forward for and this time do you know why we have the dot here so now we have Bob dot forward does anyone have an identity pardon sir cuz when we did Bobby equals total we did dot yeah kind of so what we did up here is we made Bob a turtle so it kind of created the turtle and every function that's in like this turtle yeah kind of went into Bob yeah so that's why I like forward is now a part of Bob it's kind of like if Bob like had a set of commands to do like forward all these different things now it's part of Bob so that's why we want to say Bob dot forward and that means Bob will move forward so if you press ENTER if you go back to that window that opened you might see a small yeah yeah so that's like from the line of code that said Bob go forward so it might be a tiny line because that's just the small amount that it moved so you can try play around with it and make it a bigger number it's amazing you went off the page and it went off the 4h I think it's too big of a number yeah yeah so if you want um it to turn back because if yours has gone out of the page you can make him turn back so one function we can use is left so what you'd need to type is Bob dot left yeah yeah left so like facing left but inside the brackets we can say like how much we want it to turn left so you do you guys know your angles yes yep it's facing this way and you want to make it turn the other way yep so inside the brackets you would just type in 180 and then if you press ENTER and go back to your the screen so you should you should see that the cursor has turned the other way yeah and then if you go forward this time forward and then put in a number it moves the other way the basically forward makes Bob move whichever way it's facing so let you guys play around with that a bit so try and make a shape if you can so like a square or rectangle or something so have like have a think about how you might wake make a square so if you know your angles in which way it's facing and like this all the sides even are they different try have a play around with it okay and see I made Bob do a big circle oh you mean do big circle what did you use I did Bob don't circle yep in brackets 999 999 whoa that is a big number yes a dot circle is another function you can use so it like automatically makes it draw the circle yeah and then the number inside so juicy as you're typing like some text comes up with a yellow background so that's kind of telling you what should go in the bracket so it's saying draw a circle with a given radius so that number 999 that you did that's how big the radius of the circle was I did a small circle you did a small circle so what did you change to make it small I made it 21 yep good job sir do you guys know like the radius in shapes do you know what the radius is yeah when eluted yours deleted what happened the what thing got deleted I don't know it just great Cheryl scream oh my god all right yeah I'll just stop sharing um and you can start sharing your screen and we can see what happened so do you remember how to share your screen just click share I did click share okay you might need a truce like when you click Share you might have to choose which screen you want to share as well click that one yeah I'll just click I'm sure yeah okay it might be a bit slow as well sometimes it's a bit laggy so if you click share like it would give you some options and say which one you wanna share yep Oh Kailyn this is that best to scream yeah something like that but this time we won't quarry to do it so Cory do you wanna try sharing your screen again yeah I'm trying to press desktop one yep and is it doing anything it could just be a bit slow it's not doing anything it's not doing anything hmm maybe just give it a couple of seconds it could be lagging a bit sometimes the share screen takes some time in the meantime what was the thing that got deleted do you know what it was turtle the turtle like the thing that was drawing oh I think your thing started sharing okay so yeah so I'm gonna talk you sure yep you're a true screen yeah cool so is it just that other window that got deleted yeah okay so I might have just accidentally got unclosed or something what you could do is because this is just a Python shell maybe if you just close it and open up idle again Cory can you still hear me can you guys still hear me yeah yep okay sorry I think it's being a bit slow so yeah maybe just close the shell and open up idle again and then you just need an importer so just remember because the shell is just kind of a oneline thing that's not like a file which we can save so it's okay to just close it and open it again because right now we're just testing things anyway yep so before doing that do you remember what the first step is that we need to do so before we can use turtle we actually need it import it oh yeah yeah because we close it and open it again it's like it started new yep and then turtle do I need a capital not for this okay total yes and then now we need to make like a little variable thing yep so now yeah let's back up again and you can just play around with what you're doing before now okay I'll just share my screen again yeah stop sharing that's okay if I press share I think it stops yours anyway yep so another thing you guys can do with turtle is you can change the color of it so right now the line is just black so what you can do is you can go cool Bob so Bob dot color but um it's felt the American way so you don't have a U in the word color it's a bit confusing and then we have the brackets and inside the brackets what we need is to put a color but we need to put the color in the quotation marks so like this if I want it to be blue and make it blue in quotation marks and then if you go back to your screen you can see that the little arrow change to be blue and if you draw a line you can see what it looks like and another thing you can do is so do you see how right now the little arrow like our turtle on my things called Bob it's just the shape of the cursor so it's just an arrow yeah actually change the shape as well yep so you just go Bob dot J and then there's a few set shapes so like a turtle is an actual shape and if you press and it change into a turtle otherwise there's a few more if you want to see what they are you can just Google Python turtle shapes and then you can see what options you have and you can do the same thing for like color and stuff as well if you want to see what kind of set colors they have do we have to do no shaping quotation marks yes you do so because these are all words they're kind of like strings so you have to do it in quotation marks so if you go on to here and so this is like the documentation website yeah they have like all the functions you can use and then you can for example you can see color Oh shape so if you click on the word shape it will tell you all the shapes that doesn't it says it's somewhere let me do I find it's someone yeah okay I think there's like circle and square and things I'll let you guys have a look at the that as well on your own so this is the Python documentation it's very useful so if of it like if you ever forget what one of the functions are that we've learnt you can just look quickly look it up here oh yeah but forget like exactly how to type it it'll show you I'm gonna go back to shape oh yeah so it says here because the shape thing only has a few like predefined shape so it says up here it has like arrow turtle Circle Square triangle classic so you can try change it to any one of those and just remember it needs to be in quotations cuz they're like words or their strings you can also do the same thing for changing the color so if you want to see what color options there are you can go on to this website so to get to that website you can just type in like python turtle color or something like that and you should be able to find it mmhmm so I'll let you guys quickly go on to that website and just have a look and then I'll let you try find what colors though and then have a play around with changing the colors and joy so did you guys manage to find the website Oh have a look now yep yeah now and then tric so I just want you guys to have a look at what color options that are and play around with that so generally I think it has like most of the basic ones so if you guess the colors it would probably be a color on there but just to be sure you can always just double check on that website so it should be the first result when you google it so if you just google like python turtle color oh did you find something um I found a list of shapes you found a list of shapes oh cool we pison avi Python oh cool yeah so is that like a circle turtle little pison shapes python shapes and it comes up with a pison dog and then you can see he'll see you that's nice let's see going is that welcome see the changing shapes text is it working forward what the shape changing oh yeah it's working okay cool yeah so sometimes this is I think just like a list of all the shapes that python has in general so the other one is just the shapes that's like the turtle library has but this is what Piper has in general I think but I'm guessing that it works for book which is pretty cool and another thing there's one more thing you can change oh well there's a few more things you can change but another thing you can change is the size so the size of the pin which is the thickness so do you see how right now our lines a really thing ya can change it so you can just go bub size and then I might type in full okay might not be size let me double check what it is make sure to type in total mm might be pen size but they want it might be pen size so let me double check yeah so it's pen size so do you see here how it's pen size all lowercase and one word so you just type in sorry I'll move it so you just type in bub pen sides and inside that you can get in the side issues no something this is just the number you don't need the quotations the quotations are just so down would you make it how did you make it go upwards go upwards like to draw upwards yeah so which way is your thing facing right now is it facing the left yeah yep so do you remember like with your angles if we want to make it go up straight up do you know how much degrees that is yeah how much degrees is it 90 90 yep but it's 90 degrees to the right so you know how last time we were going like something duck left 90 this time try then this time try um like Bob dot right 90 so what it's saying is turn to the right 90 degrees and then if you go back it should have changed so just try that and see the race is it wrong something wrong yeah then you must ask money can help you just won fixing it Oh money yeah you can just look at it Cory just call on red I don't know what he's doing okay so the red just means that arrows but it's like nothing too bad oh yeah but then I fixed it yeah so if you fix it that's good so you can show you soon if you want but otherwise it's okay if you fixed it that's fine so the red things are just little error messages so like sometimes let me share my screen again and show you sometimes if you accidentally type something wrong I'll forget the exact word it will give you that message so like how when I typed in Bob Jacques sighs it gave me that error message just saying that there's nothing cold sighs because it was actually pen sighs yeah it's just like that so like this if I say Bob forward and don't do anything okay it's not a red message but it's still like an error message it was that clear yeah this is a blue message it's a bit different ignore the blue message for now but like if I typed in Bob but accidentally forgot the B or something and then did forward I'd get another red message so they're basically just error messages but they're nothing like to be too worried about it just cuz they just tell you what the error is so it's just generally it comes if he accidentally typed something wrong oh you like you forgot a little space or something yeah but yeah so did you guys have a go at trying to change the pen size yes yep and did it work yeah did yeah okay cool so what we might do now so this was all just in the Python show what we'll do now is actually make a program so do you guys remember how to make a program No so that's from Python shell you just go file and then click new file and then a window should open up and it just looks empty yep yep so that's what you want so Cory do you have that open is uhhmm wait what so what we're doing now is because what we're doing before was just all in the Python shell so it's just like line by line stuff but we're actually going to make a little mini program now so to make a new file you just click on the top and your Python shell and click on file and then new file by oh yeah so you should be on the very top I think because yours is a Mac right yeah yeah so make sure you didn't shake fire anywhere what does it say new file yeah yep new fun wrote it and then did a window open up yes yep okay yeah so now it's just empty but you can like type in stuff but we actually need to type in Python code so what do you guys if we want to use turtle do you guys remember what the very first thing we need to do is input just yes good job so do that and you can close this Python shell now and the other one as well yeah just the shell so just so that we don't get confused hit enter yep hit enter so now when you hit enter nothing happens so that's just because we've written this bit of code in the file but we haven't actually run the file so let's do one more step so let's create our turtle when I close the outer shell it close the turtle close the turtle the drawing turtle yeah yeah that's fine because the idle like that turtle thing was part of the idle shell yeah yeah so what we'll do is we'll just create our turtle as well so do you guys remember how to do that so we give it a name yeah yep yep and then what do we need to type equals equals Oh yep turtle and remember turtle dot turtle with the uppercase T so just remember the title like the lowercase turtle can anyone remind us what that like the lowercase Turtle end up yeah it's turtle but open it yes so it means that it's like from that turtle library and then the turtle with the uppercase T and the brackets does anyone know what that is no that's okay so it's basically a function that creates our turtle so it kind of sets it up so base in Python generally in programming languages if any has like these two brackets here afterwards it generally means that it's a function or method yeah so do you guys remember what that is a method or function no that's okay so it's basically like a bit of code that someone like that someone has already written and we can reuse it yeah just before you said it I remembered you remembered yeah just a second to it yeah yeah that's good that you remembered yeah so like you know how Docs forward and yes and things those are all methods that someone has written that actually makes our turtle like move move yeah so it just makes it easier for us because we don't have to write like a whole bunch of code in whatever direction you made it go yeah yeah hi David can you give me hi yep okay so we've started the lesson so and what I might get you to do is to try like follow on as we're going along yes so um in Idol can you just open up Idol please and then create a new file yes yep and then everyone else while you're waiting just save um the program you have made and I'll save that and then choose a folder to save it in and then give it like a name so maybe you could call it like intro turtle or something less file yep and then save this yeah yep and then okay then thing should pop up yeah and then you can just choose where you want to save it if you want to make a folder may be called like Python class or something I mean it says save as and then I have to type it so file save as do you have any like pictures all like little folder things like how it looks like on my screen no no a screen and show you yeah sure like stop sharing mine okay said David once you have Idol open just click on file and new file just pops okay so yours is a bit different so do you see that thing wet says where and documents say I just wanted to do a folder and just check if Hills done yes so if you just and nice you did you see it okay cool that's good to open it you just have to right click and press edit with idle right click yeah oh so that that's not for you cause I that was so Chester oh sorry do you see like those things that says desktop documents things like that yeah yeah so it says well when does that little blue icon those it's the pictures I mean so it does I just the folders on your computer so you can just choose where you want to save it so if you want to easily find it you could just put it in like document so I'm desktop or something if you put it on desktop it'll just be like you know how Idol is just sitting there you'll be able to see it on your screen oh yeah just yeah and then where it says save as you just type the name of the file so you can give it a name like turtle intro or something like that and then just press tags you don't really need to worry about that you can just press save and then format that's fine because it's a Python file so let's write down here now yeah so it might have appeared somewhere on your desktop yeah it has yep okay that's good yeah so now that you guys have saved it I want you guys to click run and then run yeah so on the top where file was there should be another thing called run yeah and then you can click on run module the bottom yeah run module f5 yep so what that does is it actually runs this code that you have in your file run so maybe give it a second did anything happen for you Chester we're going to run it did anything happen when you try to run your program from yep so make sure you open it again yeah I did but I closed the idle like Jake close that hole file like when you had your clothes I don't think good trick to see if it would work yes then I clicked on the file but it didn't open it okay so to open the file this is good for everyone to know to open the file that you've saved you have to find it first and then click right click yeah there should be an option called edit with idle and then if you click on that it should open the fire oh yeah I just clicked and it was yep I know so Cory I might get you to try that as well just so you know for next time so just close your file that you have open right now yeah yep Dex yeah so we're just like gonna pretend like it's a new day and you closed everything but you wouldn't come back to your file maybe click out of it and click back in how just click like somewhere in the background you see on the bottom how the little idle icon is open down there next to the rubbish bin yeah I try rightclick on that if you rightclick on it does any settings go mmm if I right click yep yes so just press quit down there we just want to close it and then try it later and maybe give it a second might take a second good load mmhm also David do you have a new file open I have I have some some problems of his idol was the last time I was on Idol I accidentally doing to did and now like I can't find it completely says nothing is found and I downloaded then it says it says Python modifier Reap repair or uninstall I might get you to share your screen everyone else Chloe don't worry about closing that for now can you still type on that file it could be frozen maybe stop sharing your screen as well it might be making it a bit slow and try and after you've done that while I'm helping David what you guys can do is try and make like a square shape so do you remember how we were doing it in show with a forward and right and stuff try adding those lines of codes to make a shape but this time type it in your actual file and then when you press run it should automatically draw your shape does that make sense yep yep okay so David what happened with Python G modify modify repair or uninstall I think I think I have to do uninstall ungenerous install it again yeah so chesta does that make sense what I told you to do yeah yep okay so try like do like Bob forward and stuff and try and make a shape and when you've done a couple of lines you can press run run module and then it should open up shell and then it should open up the other Python window and you should be able to see your shape okay so David now it is still so you can go back and try and stall it now the same way you did so Cory can you hear me you still now so Chester maybe once you've done a couple of lines just try run it and see what it was like now do I close it close it close on the file yeah I type to run module but it didn't run the turtle shell thing so today I'll let you try to find that and then just did you wanna try show you a screen I can't find it anywhere so one thing you might need to do is Chester do you see that second line the Bob equals total duck total maybe just get rid of that line it might be closing in error I am and then do you see Bob duck forward yeah whenever you use that they need to have brackets and it needs to have a number in the brackets like that one yep so like the bottom one delete this one yep you can delete it and sorry what I meant by run module so you can get rid of those words that say run module under to run it you have to you see on the top where it says run like it says file I did yeah yep run click on that and then click on run module over there it yep and now okay that's okay yep every time you run it you need to be safe and yeah so now you know but if you go into your shell do you see the red texture yeah it means there's an error message so if we click on top on the shells it tells you what the error is it says total object has no attribute forward so do you see what the issue it yeah what's thank you that I didn't put brackets at the end with the numbering the board so not exactly but your clothes about where the error is so the error is just it's a simple one so it's just the word for word they spelt wrong so it got confused oh the forward has a a and then a yep so a for the second Oh oops sorry f w a it's W a body yep and now try run it again so do the same thing yep so do you see how it did the line yeah yeah so now it's doing like the exact same thing is what we were doing in Python shell except it did it all in at once okay and like keep adding lines to it and it can like keep drawing shapes and stuff that's how you actually use that Python turtle code in and I got it yep so Cory were you able I share now yeah you can stop sharing now and also it's the end of the lesson I'm pretty sure Oh Cory were you able to type on your file again oh yeah oh sorry just the did you have a question it's yeah it's like did anyone have any question no no okay um so Cory were you able to type on your own if not that's okay because it's saved and then if you want at the beginning of next lesson I can quickly I'm show you what I was telling you about but basically I don't know if you were looking at Chester's screen but what we're doing it was just putting the Python code in the application you can move it around can you type in it no no okay um so I might we might try figure out what the issue is next week because this lessons almost up it could just be that it's frozen or something I'm not a hundred percent sure but basically what we were doing with that file is did you see what Chester was doing on his screen so we were just putting like the code that we were typing in like in the Python shell we were actually putting it in the file so that you could have you could run that Python file and do all that code all at once so we can quickly go over it at the beginning of next week if you want but for now we'll have to finish off the course and David fish I'll try help you find the file next week but until then if you could try have a look in your computer and see where if you can find idle it should be there somewhere it might be in like programs and then a folder called Python or something just look for it and see if not I'll help you next find it but other than that did anyone have any question no no okay Cory David did you guys have any questions no no okay cool so I'll just leave fit and then I'll see you guys next week I guess okay see ya good week you too you too
