okay so go through that court you click the code that's oh yeah yeah so it asks you something it's asking how many sides with the shape have you need your number now put you didn't put anything so say say for example you want to have an triangle so for triangle we have three sides three sides so we need to it's okay just run it again I think you need to run it again okay stop sharing by just to shame all right let's see say something can I see your code again you're not caught cause this one closed the share press interkorea you fine so we just gonna go forward and next time you can share dabbing dabbing I'm going to use another four here like if I say for example for I in range and look back to code but for now I'm going to say use two knobs notes in one in together so we're gonna miss that their second for what's the different if I use one for loop in the another one so this second for its belonging to face forget about this one I'm going to break hashtag hashtag is for comment yeah hashtag do you know hash that we use hashtag here to put the comedy for example for saying what we have done so far so so what this happen when Spartan is going to run each long reign by each line from the top to the bottom when it's going to teach hashtag doesn't care about things just skip it we put this kind of comments not decide what we have done and what does it mean h4 so you can do it you can every class that we have comments you forgot next time just go through the comments and you remember what we are going to do it after why do teams guys for loops like it's going to messy going forward 10 pixel and then it's happened and it's going to execute again four times this one this one and this so we can do music whatever we have here and change the number I see can make those are some weird shapes looks like a flower if I kept going you look like this hour you can make changing you can change over the number and very fast fish actually point in painting our quotes the first one the first one to say now listen okay the first one it's okay Mizuki the first one is 20 connection so 20 20 I tried to make it 20 degree so it's fine it's dangerous 20 degree and now I'm here it's safe for I in range for example all shake sides should be similar and here's a messy net 20 again 20 degrees the same degree that we have the details are very introducing we are here in messy then I'm going back here I'm not going I'm going back in this line because you have to do it four times we finish for dries we're going to thank you for now I'm going to back to went backward fifty again from here I'm going to make left 20 this way there's a mother so it's going to 23 this way and again how many time another time for time for example granny's finish is going to back here so it's going to say again one time here one time here and then for time years so every all time he's going to execute five time in the loop though instead of just one time here and two times fifty one two three four five five time you should say for how much for five tornado so it's happened 20 times these two loops is how many times I think here one time here alright I'm here for time here so it's five thank you this one so if you go through and change your code who wants to show me the shape mine's also having a problem it says funny funny does not match any outside pretty cool shape what half of a cylinder it looks like the bottom of the table could be this makes our imagination Cory what you did you change your numbers in quotes to see what we have Clutton did you change your so everyone was once we have a different numbers in your code what we're gonna have as the shape different unique shape what's your unique shape well I haven't changed you can't change you to music you can change so we have mine it's not a shape it's a weird line just line yeah it's like just like it's like I don't know like come cough let's put steak and for a bit forward in the same well the second loop that you have inside the nested loop yeah that's one should be in the same line meet the previous code not know if you did that as me they not belonging to first loop we want to every one of those belong to okay let's see what we have is not the things that we have but let's see you didn't make a comment so you need to put you didn't make a comment in questions so you need is ask you a question about how many sites will be here in the show oh yeah what I got it here yeah okay it doesn't matter for now because you haven't used it you're right for more understanding do something put the comment that's we use hash use hash type or every every single lines that we have before two loops so if you put hash tags for question four sides all of those before could you do it now fully put the hash tag before question yeah before you know I did the first character so gold at the beginning part of the question so go to the I'm not here okay have a look it I'm going to back to my code have a look to Michael at how I put this nope nope here come here see my could you see my screen yes I can see I put the sharp here this one doesn't make but I'll just put the line as a declaration this one that's mean I asked Python to don't execute my code you can do it for a question side and anger as well till here what I look forward to show you to show you how I can use the camera to the number that I asked from the user here so the same that we've done here are going to say for our in rain so I'm gonna ask the user how many signs I'm gonna use the variable here the size that we ask yeah and then the angles that we divided from the sides you can change your quotes as well like ask me does it show me write something like yeah that's let's say to just green I'm back it does to doesn't make any shape doesn't actually at least trim Ron it's just a line again and it just makes a try ninja star looking thing mmmhmm so you can use the variable as a science institute number if you put so sides and then for lift the angles aren't you I'm gonna delete this part the shape looks so cool Rarity's you can make cool things as well made it tiny hey lolly wrap the shaitaan' would you mind sure do you want me just to run the shape of the code as well you know when is Ronnie I'd like to see how it's drawing wow that's cool so I went to a really curious what's your coats honey do that we're changing the numbers so could you share the codes oh yeah sure okay so you did four times every time and then 50mm but you changed okay you change the angles to 14 that's right it's ended up with a very cool shape and that could be run out now again how it's drawing whoa okay see how it's game bill doesn't show us how it's drawing it's gone very technical difficulties I can't show my I show it I can't show how it's game drawn and just show what the finishing touches for quite um you shouldn't like share it before you run it see like share it and then you run it afterwards yeah I can't running moto so I lied sharing the um yeah I do I did the same that Utah so forget about like that that's a hands like that like it when I try to do it it says unexpected incident are you haven't put the comments in to courts after the first for loop so here you need to put the comments yeah did you need to yes yeah touched us to hashtag and you know how to put the hashtag others to just press we're about to finish just run this one see if you have any problem and there is something happen Oh show it again because you have a problem you have something stay in your second new your second look is not belonging to fair slope because you know that because what Harry could you tell others that was the problem here so in the second for loop you should put it inside in the same line that's mean you know in the same line that you have for forward and left see my court this one it's all in the same line this two point what we longing to you this fourth that's why they are in a wonderful music did you get it yeah I'm doing I'm doing much it looks like on your screen okay so let's remember whenever we need to put in that in the same line otherwise like we wanna step back see what's happened we don't have the same shape that we have this is a different shape because these two are belonging to this forward one yeah it doesn't really really weird shape well it's not a shame it's not the same shape that I expected yes so that's because these four are not belonging to disk or anymore it's not nested when I put one step forward that's the same this same myself going same line straight then the other one that means they are belonging it's true now I can see I have the same result I'm copy your coats Heron thank you and everybody joy hope you enjoy the class today tell me if you have any question the last question nothing my question okay just you can practice at home whenever you have oh it's nothing just another unexpected incidentally that's fine different cool different numbers and even weirder shake that's fun that's nice you can make your imagination it's not really shape that we run up the times hope you enjoyed and see you next time boys but thank you but rice Enix Craster bye bye
