so you might just see a little button on the top saying your screen is being recorded or something like that and I'm just going to share my screen now so let me know and you can see my screen I can see it you can see cool I'll get you can see okay cool so um just everyone have Idol open or can you please open it again if you closed it yep yep so Cory you have it open you did this intro class with me a couple of weeks ago and so this lesson is similar to that of but like hopefully it'll be a good refresher for you and then like the next lessons we'll build upon that okay so I'll just quickly introduce what Python is to chest as well so basically with Python Python is what you call a programming language and then you can make pretty much like anything on the computer is done through programming languages so things like YouTube and like games and websites all of those even like a microwave has like a little computer in it and it has some code that makes it run so we'll be learning Python which is like typing like a programming language and I'll show you a couple of examples of things you can make with Python so you can do stuff that a tech space and you can also draw graphics so if you see my screen Cory do you remember this the Python code yep yeah so this on the left here gesture this is Python code like that's what it looks like don't worry about it too much we'll go through it after but this is like an example of what a Python program might do that's asking me down here how far will Bob walk and maybe I'll just say 20 and it draws a line and then how many degrees did say 19 and it turns so this thing on the screen is called turtle it's a turtle but also turtle is like what Python uses to drill graphics so right now it's drawing things like lions and stuff like that later on you can make it do shapes and cool things I'll show you another dragon though so this is a textbased Python program hey you love that game yeah it's pretty fun show you what it does you have to pick a door so it's asking me to pick a door so what number should I choose that three okay three and then it says you found the treasure so if I run it again I can pick another door okay one oh I'm gonna type the one in the wrong place one and it's like oh no the dragon got you so depending on which door you go and it will give you a different result and by the way this thing what I'm showing you the programs on now is something called shrinked it so this is where you can write Python programs but it's online and then you can say which you account but because this is a longer course like we have a few lessons that's why I'm getting you guys to use Idol so it's just the same thing but Idol is actually on your you know it's just easier because you can save things and you don't need to worry about the internet like if you're not connected or anything like that you can always view your projects at any time so anyway I'll get started now so can everyone go back to your Python shell so can you guys see my screen and your Python shell at the same time yeah yep so you might need to make your zoom screen a bit small okay so I think our other student joined in and can you hear me David is it is it did you have it open or did you know if you closed it hello oh sorry David can you hear me yep okay um it might be on the bottom so Corey your Python shell it might look like a little piece of paper like do you see on the bottom how mine looks like this the thing that's moving so if you just click on it or doubleclick on it it might open again um so David can you hear me okay so my name is Imani we just soldered the Python class but I'll quickly show you what we're doing have you done any Python before yes I did okay you've done two lessons hey that's good so I'm just letting you know this is like the level one Python and like this is a first lesson so some of the stuff you might know that it will just be like a little refresher have you done any online classes before also they were online so do you know how to use zoom and everything and they won yes the first time my dad used it for me okay that's okay so I'll just quickly show you generally right now I think you can see my screen if you can see stuff on your screen so generally the lessons will be me sharing my screen and you guys following along on your computers but sometimes if you have any questions or issues I'll get you guys to share your screen so I can see what's happening and if on the top or bottom you might have a button called chat you see that yeah yeah so if you can like if there's any point where I can't hear you or you can't hear me or you just want to ask me a question you can message me in that chat instead so do you see that David do can you hear me yep okay cool and then if there's any point you need to share your screen I think the button is on the top it says share a new share it might be green button okay no so the share screen button just shows what's like on your computer screen so it doesn't show your face anything it just shows like what you're working on so right now do you see how you can see my screen yes yes so if you press the share button we can all see your screen so when I press the share button SURS you cannot start screen share while the others participants sharing I am so that's just because in this meeting only one person can share it at a time so usually it'll just be me sharing but then if one of you need to share your screens then I can stop mine and then you can show your screens okay yeah and then oh sorry oh you can't find it um okay so maybe you know how I was telling you before to search and type in idol ID le from all my applications maybe try do that again oh so David do you know if you have Python on your computer mmm no I don't have part of mark of doodle okay so that's the thing so if you open up the chat thing do you see how I sent a link up above at the very top um I'll send it again oh yeah yeah I should get it so if you just click on that okay I'll get you to download Python so you should just see a website like this and learn Python three points 7.3 yeah just just collection just one okay I'm just gonna stop sharing my screen for a second um kori do you want to open your screen again share your screens alright so I can try get Idol back up okay so if you just type in there if you try to open idol so ID le again so you did down the lit right hmm okay maybe if you go into your downloads and try find yep just there up the sub you see I think it says quite thing if you try double click on yeah and just continue and maybe just install it again and what do you next installed Python install now and yeah and saying Asura's do want to allow this up to my change yep yeah okay it's installing cool and then maybe Sakura maybe once its installed just save it on your desktop or something or make a show cut okay CDC Idol on the top there actually I might get all of you to do it once its installed so Chester maybe do this too so when you open Idol you got to open okay cool I'll just share my screen again just to show you guys something so once you open up Idol you rightclick on it okay maybe you cut right um I said you see I just got it on my desktop oh you have it on your taskbar okay that's good um Corey do you want to do that too I did it before you did it before okay cool that's good it just makes it easier to find it I thought so too when you search Idol if you just rightclick on it you can just press pin to start or pin to taskbar so they'll just make a shortcut so that you can always open it like it's easy to find next time so if you go back into idle so you know how you had like what you double clicked on to open it whistle in your files do you want to share your screen again quickly oh so David do you have it installed now okay um so right now core is sharing his screen and if you just click on that thing in the background that says idle this one yep and just click on that just to go into that screen and then on that top up there um oh sorry not that up where it says the words idle and capital letters you know the thing that's highlighted yet if you just rightclick that yeah oh it hang on I'm just unclick it and then rightclick it again because you accidentally click on the words I think okay yeah um what you can do is maybe oh maybe absolutely just drag that and then put it on your desktop screen okay try that yep just to make it like a shortcut so that you can find it later oh yeah okay so next time yeah so now that it's there so whenever you need to open it you can just double click on that yeah so David is yours nearly finished until it's finished but it says setup was successful and I don't know what your parishioners okay so now I might get you to share your screen so do you mind just pressing that share button so it's my yeah and then it might give you a message just pressure screen or something and then it will stop Corie screen from cheering yes so sometimes like even with programming like setting up takes a while and then once you've set up the first time then everything is really easy after that so because this is the first lesson might just take a while to get everything set up but we're nearly there um so David did you see the share button the share screen button on Zoo can you hear me David all right yes yep so did you see that button that says share yeah so I did it okay do you mind clicking on it please just so yeah I can't but it says you can also screen share while the participants are sharing and does it say anything after that like share anyway your stop oh no it doesn't okay maybe sorry Cory can you please stop sharing the screen and then so I think on the bottom or like near where it says share there should be an option to say in zoom yeah yeah cool okay now David you should be able to say okay um do you have the place where your Python installed so like on your desktop in your downloads or something yes do you mind so python idol or person 3.7 model Doc's Python Idol okay yep so you might need to reshare your screen and press shared desktop because I think what you're sharing now is just this command line Bowl okay second Oh they see like black little box yeah leticia okay so what are you so I think it says desktop or something Oh like my eggs ish yeah wait yes so that's Python shell but sorry I'll just if you go back and I'm going to stop your share screen for a second yeah okay so the thing that you need to click on when you're sharing screen is just screen so then I can see your whole screen oh yeah okay right okay yeah but there's no yeah do you see something called screen or desktop one or something like that no what what options do you see I see oh yeah wait oh yeah do you see everything yeah okay now I see everything okay so if you go a heavy saved idle to the bottom tier task already out of I think you have it on the bird no there's no idle like the Python thing sorry yeah I'm gonna do okay there's two of those now jjust okay yep cool one said don't need right yes so maybe just close everything for the minute and then open it again so I'll just show you how to find idle so if you just close oh sorry not the share screen oh okay okay it's okay and you don't need to show screen so if you just close that Python show you head yeah sure so on a device or a crush yeah so I'll just show you so that you know how to open it up yeah I think already know yup I don't click it like okay good okay Neri okay idle mmhmm and okay so I think everyone has idle open now I'll share my screen and then we'll get started yep yep okay so does everyone have can everyone see my screen and your screen yes yeah yep yep okay cool yeah so yeah sorry that setup it took a while so I'll just try to go through this is like the first class so I'll just we won't make a program yet I'll first teach you like an introduction to Python and then we'll see how our time goes yeah yeah so this what you see right now when you've opened up idle is called the Python shell so those three little greater than signs like that little arrows that's where you type so you can type anything but it like you might get an error like this that's just because it's expecting Python code yes one thing that programming languages can do is it can do basic math equations so like 10 plus 10 so if you just tried you a math equation and press Enter it gives you the answer Amani how do we make your screen a bit bigger my screen so if you go and you click into zoom yeah so I'll let you guys play around for like a minute tried through different math equations so you can do as well like 100 minus 20 or something I made it say hello you made it say hello okay you already know that I like with the numbers or with actual letters that is oh that's the next step good job so does this make sense to everyone so far just tell you can do maths with programming languages yes so by the way guys if you have any questions like throughout the lesson just let me know David does this make sense to you as oh yeah yeah so yeah this is just one thing programming languages can do so I can do like really big masked equations as well like okay if you just type in random numbers and things like that it will give you the answer and so right now we've just been doing money how do we put the your screen in our our screen side by side okay so my screen is going to be a bit smaller and then your screen has to be your Python shell has to be like you can make it smaller by dragging it to images as well can you make yourself bigger so make my one yeah yeah I get it I don't screen a bit bigger all right yeah sure you can also are you like this so you can also make it bigger on your screen by when you go into zoom like making that screen a bit bigger because it might be cut off by your screen if that makes sense so did you manage to resize it no but her screen is so small okay what I might do all says I'll just share my idle screen so that you don't see that other stuff just so that you can see more of the screen that might help as well so now you can only see my Python yeah yeah okay yeah cool umm can everyone else still see their screens on my screen yeah yep okay cool yeah yep so yeah um Python can do like plus and minus and it can also do like division and multiplication but does anyone know what those signs are on the keyboard yes yeah what Adam vision is the slash yep exactly so if you want to do division you can do something like 100 divided by 5 so it's just this glass here if you press ENTER you get the answer and tithe is the store yep exactly time to stuff stuff so like you can type in a random number time 100 or something and it gives you the answer does that make sense to everyone so far yep yep yep yep David how about you yes yes think I get it you think you get it so have you been trying it on your shell as we've been going along yes yeah yeah ok cool yes like as I'm explaining it you guys can type it on your own computers as well and then you can play around with it to see what it does as well so yeah I'm already doing yep are you doing that yeah so that's just like the maths bit of it but you can also do something called so this is all with numbers and there's also something called variables you can tell me what a variable is yep oh yes that's cool yeah school is an example of a variable so a variable is kind of like a little box that remember something so like Corey will sing a school is a variable because like in games it keeps track of your school so keep track of it in a variable so I'll show you an example so you guys can type it on yours as well so for example if we wanted to make a variable in Python we can make if we wanted to make a school for example we can type in school is equal to so when we're setting a variable to something we use that equal sign so we want to say like score is equal to and maybe one we want start them off at 10 or something any press enter and once you've done that when you press ENTER it looks like nothing's happened so it just takes you to another line yeah and night and now you do school and it says to do 10 yep exactly so uh if you type in school it tells you what value that variable has yeah yep okay so now another thing you can do is if this was like an actual game you'd have your school but then every time you collect like coins or something you might add some points to that school so if you wanted to add points to our variable here which is the school does anyone want to tell me what I might need to type in does anyone know today pardon do we want to add something on to our school it's like if we want to go school plus like school plus yep so what we want to do is say yes so because like our school our school is ten we can go then you plus whatever number you want to get so we can go score plus five for example and what number would that give us before pressing enter does anyone know what it would give us yeah yep what is it called eNOS fifteen yes it's fifteen so the reason why it's doing that is because we already made something called scope and we made our variable called school and that has a value of ten and it's telling us the school is ten so in our next line score plus five is just the same as typing ten plus five mean do that make sense to everyone yeah yeah Chester David does that make sense to you guys yeah yep cool so another thing you can do is now if you type in school and press Enter it's telling us it's ten does anyone know what that is oh yeah because as the first time a major school it goes ten mmhmm so I never is grating up up to it it still still give us the first one yes exactly so the reason one is school plus five again yes but we also need one more sign so we need that equal sign because we if we ever want to like change that value like change the value of school we need that equal sign otherwise it's just gonna do like some basic math well if you type in school is equal to the school plus five that will add on how do you think maybe the name thing after you wanna do the name thing just remember what I was telling you about strings as well what do you need for swing yeah so try that for everyone else so if you want the scores value to actually change you need that equal sign so what I did now is score is equal to score plus five and if I type in school and press Enter now it's 15 to try that and see if it works cool yeah so it's always good to just play around with it and experiment yourself as well and does it make sense to everyone yep okay cool and then another way of doing this because typing score is equal to school plus five is a lot to type so a shortened way of doing it is just to go to school is plus or equals five and if you press ENTER it's the same thing as doing school is equal to scale plus five that's just a shortened form now if I type in school and press Enter it's now 20 I just that make sense to just try that and see so like in a game like you know in Mario every time you get the coins like you might get ten more points like in the background this is what the code is doing so it has your school and every time you collect a coin it might just go to score is plus a equals ten does that make sense to everyone yeah yep okay on to the next thing so so far all what we've been doing is all with numbers and variables we can also do things with something called strings in Python so Cory do you remember what a string is sort of yeah yeah Soto um does anyone want to tell me what this it's okay otherwise if you can't remember it I can explain it again so a string in programming languages is basically it's just the word so like we know how these are numbers it's just like another type of data but instead it's a word so for example in a game you might ask you for your name it'll save that as a string because those are like Leben's and words it's saved as a string so what we can do is before we were saving variables as numbers so like the school you can also save variables as strings so for example you could say name is equal to and then you can type in a name and by the way so with programming languages and strings you can't just type in the string like the word like that you have to put it in quotation marks okay so that's that the computer knows that it's a string so that it knows it's just it is it's not anything else you try that like name is equal to something and then try a name and press Enter already did already did cool and then you can try that with like different things as well like fruit is equal to Apple and you can't press ENTER you can see what fruit is and then you can change it again so it's like oh actually I want my fruit to be a pear and now if I press ENTER my fruit has changed to a player does that make sense of huh yes yep so if I did this if I went fruit is equal to 3 what would fruit be now can I know and tell me so what would this variable fruit be if I pressed fruit and then pressed enter it would type in 3 it would type into yep so basically even though our variable started off as a string it can be like a number later on if we wanted it to be so another thing you can do is I'll quickly show you so if you try to go fruit is equal to grapes maybe so do you see how it's not green on my screen right now because I haven't put any quotation marks yeah I did it'll do the arrow yeah it does an error so it generally it gives you an error if you haven't done something correctly and the error tells you what like what the issue is so for example this is saying the name grapes is not defined because it thinks grapes is meant to be a variable or something because we didn't put it in quotation marks so it doesn't know that it's meant to be just the word graders so because if I made a variable called grapes and like said hello this is a variable of something now if I go fruit is equal to grapes because I use this equal sign to like define grapes or something now I won't get that error does that make sense of yeah so if I what would the value of fruit be now can anyone tell me great oh no it would still what would it say three would it yep exactly so it's a bit confusing but if I press enter korie's right it says hello this is a very quotation marks yeah exactly so what does that make sense everyone else so check then David does that make sense so is it a bit confusing quotation mots yep exactly so if I want like this variable fruit to actually be the word grape I need to put in the quotation marks otherwise it's thinking it's the value of grapes because I already made that before so that's why it says hello this is a variable does that make sense everyone else as well yeah yep so I'll give you like did you try it on your own computer so do you have a playroom dude oh cool I'll give you guys a couple of minutes to just try different variables and like see what the result is so you can say like lunch is equal to so you can just play around with different scenarios and see what happens then just remember if you ever want to change that value of the variable or assign value you need to use that equal sign so let me know if that makes sense yeah any fun yep cool so another thing you can do is you know how before we did something like score is equal to score classified or something like we use Plus with the variables because it was just numbers and it's doing that another thing you can do is you can use plus with strings so you can do something like name is equal to Bob and then last name even equal to Bobby or something yeah we do that too I did a computer company a composition and I typed in a hollow it was a lot of David mmhmm present how are you it was good thanks and you and a good equals okay cool so it's like I say hello as a computer says hello David how are you good good good and she says okay that's pretty cool yeah so what you can do like with the variables here like you can also add them together so you can go name must last name and then like because people be yeah and just mush them together so like you can make full sentences like welcome and just remember with variable names you can't have spaces into them so you can't say like I hide last name altogether in one word you can't go lost space name equals something it'll give you an error sometimes you can sometimes you can yes in Python and you can't do it for variable names just because like usually computers don't like spaces so this is saying syntax error invalid syntax so just saying there's something wrong with like the structure of that code you did races are deadly to complete it yes yeah so like what you can do is like what I did by mushing them like last name together but sometimes that might be bit confusing to read so you can go like lost and then a capital in a m e that's generally a better way to do it and then you can say like class name equals something so what you can do like with these different variables is like maybe you can say message equals like hello something and then if you wanted to print out a message to someone you can say ask message plus name and then it says hello Bob but do you see how it's all just squished together so if you wanted it to have a space you could go like message plus and then you can type in a space in the quotation marks plus name and now it gives you the space so just try that on your computer too already did already did cool how about you Chester did you try that no no okay so just tried that too like by adding two different variables together strings so like what I did here with message plus name and then it just like smooshes them together but then if you want to space in between that you can actually go like message plus and then in your quotation marks type a space and then go plus how's yours going kori do you play around with that as well yeah yep cool yeah so just remember just whatever you want actually in programming languages it needs to be a strength that needs to be in the quotation marks so like you can also because what you can do is in my last line I did message plus the space plus the name another thing you can do is you can have the space in the variable but generally you might not want that opposed like usually people's names don't have a space in it or something like that so that's why you can just type the space without having that as a variable so you can also say like yeah I'll let you guys play around with that Chester does that make sense to you did you try it yeah yes okay cool so another thing you can do is because what we've been doing every time we press ENTER after typing a variable it just like shows us the next time what that value is but in Python if you want to actually write something on the screen you can go print you can type the word print and you see how it became orange yeah that's like a Python command kind of thing so in there like after print do a circle bracket and then you can write a message inside and remember it's still a string because you want to print words so it's still have for me a string they can say like hello this is some message and remember to close your quotation mark as well and the brackets so it also doesn't matter if you do you know how before I was using that double quotation mark it doesn't matter if you do that single line as long as they're both matching so now if I press ENTER it says hello this is some message to try that on your screens so that's kind of like you know how else join you that text adventure before David wasn't here but it was like after the getting of the game it's said a message like pick a duel one two three that's how you would do something in a game like that like you would just say print and then do the message so you can also like fuse variables inside that they can go print and then I can be like welcome to Python and then that's the phrase I want to say so that's in the quotation marks but I want to also say like welcome to Python and then the actual person's name so then I'll use that variable name and then don't forget every time you have that opening bracket you need to close it on the other end so now if you press ENTER you might say welcome to Python Bob but then it might be squished together again so what do you need to do to fix that you can tell me does anyone know yes yes what do I need to do do do the speech commerce space in the middle yeah so welcome to Python because I'm already writing a message here I can just do the space here so do you see how like my last one time the speech mark is just directly after the end this time actually type in the space and then did it so now if I press ENTER it says welcome to pipe in love with the space yeah so just play around with that a bit does anyone have any questions at the moment okay if that's a day so I think the lesson is actually over now so yeah so it took a bit of time to setup and stuff yeah but next week because everyone will have idle on their computers we can just start straightaway yeah yep generally anyway the first lesson it just takes a little time to set and get used to things but did anyone have any questions with anything we did today no any general questions so did it all make sense to everyone the variables and the string from the numbers and stuff it all made sense okay cool so from next week we'll be starting to learn like some new concepts and hopefully we'll have time to like make a pro like this mini program but so now we'll leave it as that goes at the end of the lesson one more thing so what we were doing here was all in the Python shell so it wasn't actually like a Python program it was just different lines of Python so this is not like something we can run later on like save it and run because do you see how it was just doing it after every line so what you do like this one gets saved because this is just like playing around but from next week I'll show you how to actually like open a program and we can save himself but for now you can just close this and then just let it be yeah so no one else had any questions I'll leave the lesson at that because it's 530 now so don't forget to just have idle like on your computer and then next lesson we can just open it straight away because I can't already download go so I hope you guys like the class he'll find it fun yeah sorry when we've got a bit of coding done but hope you learnt a bit at least okay but yeah I'm just gonna stop sharing my screen and I'll see you guys next week see ya bye
