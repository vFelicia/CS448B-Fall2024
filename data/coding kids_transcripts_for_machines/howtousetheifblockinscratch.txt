welcome to coding kids today I'm going to show you how to use the if block with this simple animation first let's have a look at what happens when we play it the player controls the cat by pressing the up down left and right arrow keys to move the cat around the screen we can see three other characters on the screen there is a fish an apple and a balloon when the cat catches the fish he says hello fish when the cat touches the Apple he saves yummy I like apples finally when the cat touches the balloon he says I like balloons can I take this one okay now let's build this animation there are three parts to this project one the backdrop to the cat three the fish the apple and the balloon for the speech bubbles now let's start building one step at a time first let's start with a brand new project by clicking the create button on the home page you will see a new project open with a cat as the default sprite a sprite is a character or object we use in making computer programs later we will use other sprites for the fish apple and balloon so step one we want to add a backdrop click on the miniature backdrop icon at the bottom lefthand corner of the screen now you can scroll through the backdrop library and select a backdrop you like I have chosen the pool backdrop but you can choose any backdrops you like now our game has a backdrop for step two we want to add some code to our cat sprite to do this make sure our cat is selected then go to the script tab located next to the stop sign in the center of the screen we want to make our cat move around the screen to do this we need to add the when space key pressed block which we find in the events tab drag four of these blocks into the workspace now click on the drop down arrow to change the space key to up arrow key down arrow key left arrow key and right arrow key now to make our cat move we want to add a motion block to each of these event blocks to move up or down we use the yaxis and to move left or right we use the xaxis to make the cat's move up with the up arrow we need a motion block that phase change y by 10 add this block to Z when up arrow key pressed block now test it I cat moves upwards repeat this for the other arrow keys remembering that for down and left we use negative 10 for these opposite directions let's test our clothes great it works now we can move our cat around the screen by pressing the arrow keys for step three we're going to create our other sprites to import a new sprite we can click on the miniature sprite icon and select a sprite from the sprite library I will select three new sprites the fish the Apple and the balloon but you can choose different sprites to me if you like now play sea sprites in different positions around the screen for step four going to add more code to our cat so that when the cat touches these sprites he say something in a speech bubble to begin on a code we need a when green flag clicked block now if we think back to the animation we can recall that if the cat is touching a difference right then a speech bubble appears so we need an ifthen block find this in the control category and added to the when green flag clicked block this allows us to make a decision as to when the cat will speak the cat only speaks Finnish is touching another sprite so we need to select the block called touching mouse pointer from the sensing category and put it into the top of our if then block click on the dropdown arrow and change mouse pointer to one of our other sprites fish one if the cat is touching the fish we want him to say hello fish in a speech bubble so we need a say hello for two secs block from the looks category places inside our if then loop notice how we select this from the looks category and not the sound category this is because our cat is talking using a speech bubble which does not make a sound now change hello to hello fish if you want you can change the two sexes to make him say the speech for longer or shorter I will change its 23 sex for a bit longer finally we need a forever Lee this means this condition is being checked continuously by the computer we can find a forever loop in the control category put the forever loop around the if vent loop now let's click on the green flag to test our code yay it works if we move our cat to touch the fish he saves hello fish now let's repeat this for the Apple and the balloon drag to more if then blocks into our forever loop again if the cat is touching another sprite he saved something so we need the touching mouse pointer block from fencing put this in the top of each if then block change mouse pointer to apple and balloon one using the drop down arrow now if our cat is touching the Apple he says yummy I like apples and diffused touching the balloon he says I like balloons can I take this one so we need the say hello for two secs block find this in the looks category and add this to each if then block change to sex 23 sex in each for the if then block with touching apple in the top change hello to yummy I like apples for the if then block with touching balloon one in the top change hello to highlight balloons can I take this one now let's click on the green flag and test our code it was when we move our cat around the screen to touch each sprite he say something different
