welcome to coding kids today I'm going to show you how to build this game metal detector hunt first let's look at how we play it the player hovers the metal detector by moving the mouse pointer around the screen to find the hidden objects a key a bell some glasses and a guitar the metal detector will buzz when you are near an object the closest to an object the higher the pitch of the buzzer when you think you're over an object press the space key to dig the metal detector displays a message that says digging and if you click on the wrong place it says nothing here otherwise you find the object which goes into the bowl now let's build the game there are six parts to the game one game backdrop two metal detector three Bowl four hidden object objects five detecting hidden objects and six digging up hidden objects I will build this game one step at a time first let's start with a brand new project by clicking on the create button on the homepage in a new project the cat Sprite is always set as the default Sprite a Sprite is a character or object that we use in making the computer program let's delete the cat Sprite for step one let's add the backdrop by clicking on the miniature backdrop icon on the bottom left of the screen then scroll through the backdrop Library until you find a backdrop that you like you may choose a different backdrop to me double click on the backdrop you have selected or click on the backdrop then click the okay button for step two let's select a Sprite to use as the metal detector I will select a new sprite from the Sprite Library I'll select the button one Sprite you can resize this Sprite and make it smaller you can click the shrink icon in the toolbar at the top and then click on the Sprite as many times as you desire for step three we need to add a bowl Sprite this will be used to put our discovered objects in when we find them to do so select a bowl sprite from the Sprite library and put it on the top right corner of the screen in its script tab select when green flag is pressed we want the bowl to go to this position at the start of the game under motion we select the goto block and change the coordinates to X is 200 and Y is 150 we want to place the bowl Sprite behind any other Sprite that goes near it we do this by selecting the go back one layers block under the looks category and then change its number to 99 if you want to make sure a Sprite is always in the back 99 layers is usually enough to push it to the back if not add another nine then connect these two blocks together for step four I will program the hidden objects I want to use four different objects a key a bell glasses and a guitar however instead of using four Sprites I will create one Sprite with four costumes first I will select a key from the Sprite library to this key Sprite I will add three more costumes a bell glasses and a guitar so now I will go to the costume Tab and press choose costume next we need to select three different costumes for our key I will select a Belle as the second costume glasses as the third costume and a guitar as the fourth costume now to program these four different objects go to the scripts tab first we need to select the when green flag clicked block and connect it to a block that says switch costume 2 under looks category we want to switch the costume to the key Sprite so select key Sprite from the dropdown menu this makes sure that when the game starts the key is the first hidden object that we find next we need to add a block that says hide which is found under the looks category connect this block underneath the switch costume 2 block then we need to connect a goto block so that we can decide where our Hidden Object Sprite is located on the screen the goto XY block is found under the motion C category now instead of inputting specific coordinates we want to randomly generate where the Hidden Object appears we want the hidden object to appear randomly anywhere on the stage to do this we need to use the pick random 1 to 10 block which can be found under operators place the pick random block inside the xcoordinate space and repeat for the ycoordinate for the x coordinates change its range from 200 12 to positive 220 and for ycoordinate change its range from 160 to positive 100 this will make our Sprite appear randomly on our screen however because the upper y limit is positive 100 it cannot appear in the bowl for step five we need to program what happens when the hidden object is found by the metal detector the Hidden Object should appear and glide to the Bowl hide again switch costumes to a new hidden object and relocate to a random point on the screen to do this we need to use a broadcast message which could be found under the events header first I will select the when I receive block which is an event block click on the down arrow and select new message we want to name this new message found now place a show block underneath the when I receive block this makes sure that when we find the Sprite it appears on the screen after that connect a block that says Glide 2 X Y this can be found under the motion header change X to 200 and Y to 15 the coordinates of the bowl so that the Sprite will Glide to the bowl so now our Sprite will appear when it receives the message found and then Glide to the Bowl let's click on our code block to test it it works however I want it to Glide more slowly we can do this by increasing the gliding time to 2 seconds once we get to the Bowl we want our Sprite to hide again and switch to its next costume we can do this by adding a hide block followed by a next costume block which can be found under the looks category now our hidden object has disappeared and has a new costume the the final step in coding for the hidden object is to make it randomly locate on the screen again we can do this just like we did before by using a go to X Y block and two pick random 1 to 10 blocks the range of X and Y should be the same as what we used before Let's test our code by clicking our code block it works let's click it again to see if it changed costume and move somewhere else success next we want to program button one to hover around the screen following the mouse pointer click on button one and then click on the scripts tab to make the button follow your mouse pointer you need three blocks when green flag pressed a forever block and a block that says go to Mouse pointer let's drag these blocks into the workspace place the block that says go to Mouse pointer into the forever Loop and then connect them to the block that says when green flag pressed now the button one Sprite will follow the mouse pointer around the screen next we need to code for the sound effects for these sound effects we want to use different notes on a single instrument we can do this by choosing a block that says set the instrument to in the sound category and changing its number to 10 this is a clarinet there are many musical instruments that are available for for use each with its own number you may choose a different instrument to me in the sound category there is another block that says play note 60 for .5 beats this block will play the note number 60 for .5 beats with this block various notes between 72 and 48 can be played my aim is to produce notes when the distance of metal detector from the hidden object is less than 100 pixels and the space button has not been pressed the closer to the Hidden Object the higher the sound next we need to code for the space key being pressed first we need a when green flag clicked block found under the events category to do this we will use a variable that shows if the space key is being pressed or not this variable will be called detector on in the data category make a variable and name it detector on untake the variable so that it doesn't show on screen now we need to place a set detector block and set it to one after that place set instrument to 10 below it to make sure that this Sprite is not hidden behind the background use a go to front block found under the looks category next we need to go back and add some code so that the metal detector can sense when it is near the Hidden Object let's add a forever Loop below go to front and inside will place an if then block found under control in its condition I will use the and operator to check two conditions simultaneously the first condition is when our variable detector on equals to one you can make this condition with an equal two block under the operator's category and put the variable name on one side and the number one on the other side this condition means that our detector must be on for anything to happen the second condition is whether the distance to the key is less than 100 make this condition with the less than operator and a block named distance 2 which is found under the sensing category this condition allows the metal detector to tell if it is within 100 pixels of the hidden object if these two conditions are true various notes from 72 to 48 can be heard based on the distance of the metal detector from The Hidden Object now we need to use some maths to make sure that the pitch goes higher as we get closer to the Hidden Object we can find our mathematical operators in The Operators category our highest note is 72 which we'll be taking away from as we increase distance we need a subtraction operator block for this on the left we'll Place 72 now we want to take away a number based on how far away we are from the Hidden Object let's grab a division operator block We'll add the distance to Key block from sensing to the left then divide it by 100 we now need a range of notes to play based on distance let's grab another subtraction block 72 is our highest and 48 is our lowest to get our range we subtract these two numbers now we want to multiply that by the range of notes we want to use using the multiplication operator block we can multiply our distance by our range now let's place this operation on the right hand side of our original subtraction block place the connected blocks in the play Note Block found under the sound category and change its beats to n.1 this will make it play faster next let's program the sound when the space key is pressed when the space key is pressed the Shaker sound should be played let's use a block named when space key pressed and connect it to the block that says play sound until done which is under the sounds category to choose the Shaker sound click on the The Sounds Tab and select choose sound from library under new sound the Shaker sound can be found under the percussion category click back on scripts then click on The Black Arrow on the play sound until done code and select Shaker for step six we need to code for what happens when the space key is pressed select two blocks when space key pressed under events and set detector onto zero under data and connect them then add a block that says think for 2 seconds under looks and write digging in the dialogue box so now when the space key is pressed a message appears and says digging after that use the if else block to check whether the distance to the key is less than 10 or not make this condition using a less block found under operators and the distance to Mouse pointer found under sensing and change distance to Key put distance to Key in one side of the operator and on the other side write 10 place this block inside the If part of the loop next we need to make a new variable and name it items found under data if the conditions from before are true the game will broadcast found and will change item found by one so we need to add the message broadcast found underneath distance to Key is less than five then we need to add change item found by one which can be found under the data header if the condition is false the Block in the else part of the loop will operate put in the else section a block that says think for 2 seconds and change its message to nothing here outside of the if else block put a waight block for 1 seconds and add set detector on to one this makes sure that our metal detector will turn back on afterwards under when green flag clicked add a block to set the item found to zero this makes sure that our game will reset properly now let's click on the green flag to test our game [Laughter] great it works add your own features to personalize the game perhaps add a timer to play the game with a limited time and change the backdrop when you find all the hidden objects within the time limit
