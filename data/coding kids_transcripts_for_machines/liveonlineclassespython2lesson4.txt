I'll share my swing first just to show you a couple of things and then right you can share your spin off if you want if yeah but first i'll share my screen and just to show you what i'm doing i'm just gonna quickly explain so lastly it was kind of a bit unstructured because i was just trying to figure out what level yeah and then so what I think we'll do is so a lesson plans we do have more complex games like graphic games later on they don't use you want to use TK inter but they use stuff called PI game and turtle but to be able to do those games you have to be able to know like about the stuff before them so you have to be comfortable with the lessons before that so we'll be going through those concepts it's that's okay and then some of the stuff I think you might have done so we'll we can go over those quicker and like skip to the next ones wouldn't mind if we redid the clock that you showed me last yeah yeah yeah so we'll start with the clock first yeah and then so just like overall for this term so this is like called Python number two because you already know some of this stuff we could probably like speed up and then like do a bit of Python number three as well probably do both so we'll see how it goes but yeah yeah so we'll start with the clock do you want to share your screen maybe would that be easier so I'll get oh wait sorry before we start I'll show you some of the projects will be doing this semester this term anyway just so you have an idea of what we're doing and then we'll start the clock can you see my screen um okay yeah I can see it now okay so yeah this level 2 and then this level 3 cuz you already know some stuff like we went over them pretty fast so we could probably do both so things we can do I like the clock like you so and then this stuff like yeah this which uses um dictionaries and advance lists like lists you might have done them before so we'll see how we go but I'll show you the type of projects you can make with them so once it loads this is nope try not to show you the good book so like you can it use this list M loops and stuff to encrypt blood so like hello and then it encrypts the word so have you heard of encrypting before yeah yep so it's like kind of a program that does that and then you can decrypt it I think if you type in what that is it decrypts the message back to what it was so that's like some of the stuff we could be doing this time and then like this todo lists which we can also add more to make them more complex so these use this one uses things like functions lists etc and we could add like variables and like add schools and stuff so it just makes you like it allows us to know like the fundamentals of the fights and things so we can build on it so I can add something by going you're gonna say what step you want to do so one I want to add something and just say a police been added so if I want to display the list at number three I can see my list and you can remove stuff and things like that we'll go through a little later on like some of the things we could be doing this time just what you so what I'll do is what do you want me to share my screen and you want kind of solo on it okay yeah smaller okay so I think it's a full screen so if you press escape on your keyboard okay yeah I got my just see if I can make it a bit bigger just to be able to see little bit more there I'm just sharing my whole screen just because whenever we run it otherwise they'll have to stop sharing and then share the next window but you can only like you can crop your screen so that you can only see my bit when it when I get it open so yeah like you don't need to see the stuff on the side so you can like make you browse it it's more so can you see my screen and your screen okay yep good and then you just open up a new python file yeah I just use the same on my you'll each hit everything from last time so what leasing is it does the clock do you remember how the clock looks like do you want me to show you okay so we used to draw the lines it's an old turtle I think any hurdle you have yeah so using turtle and the time libraries so because the external libraries we have to import them actually I'll quickly get the clock up just so that we can break down what we need to do I'm gonna show you really quickly once it loads try not to look at the code to the first thing if you saw it when it loaded it drew the circle yeah and then the line and then it started ticking so I'll close that so this is the sort of timer you are talking about yes timer so like this is just kind of like a visual representation oh this is like with that using the sleep method still but yeah it's like yeah it's a pretty like easy way to do the timer that still works so yeah because time is a external library we have to import it yep import time and turtle yep and Turtles import by the way um yep you know to use the from from yeah yeah you can use it if you want so do you know how to use it yep yeah okay cool so yeah the other way of doing it is just like importing turtle and I'm making your own kind of thing like in the next step but the way you said it just does it in like one step pretty much so if you want to test that it works the from turtle input whatever your thing is you can run it so you might call you know what I'd use actually is I just put the star sign that allows me to import everything alright you mean up here umm no like just what you did from total total import stuff all right yep yeah that way I don't have to right right right right yeah I get you yeah that's fine too I thought you meant the next step yes so the next thing we need to do is we need to make our turtle so you can use like turtle dot something but we'll just make it with a new variable just so that we know that's the one with controlling so it's kind of like I own one so we can go like well I can call it whatever you want maybe I'll call it like tick but yeah sorry well you're gonna say ok tick equals to you okay yeah okay I get it yeah so tick equals and what we're going to do is turtle dot but you've already imported everything turtle yeah so we've imported everything so now what we're doing is you just have to go making like a turtle cold tick so we've imported everything so now we can use everything it wouldn't wouldn't you just have to write the truth with a capital T yeah so you probably could do that we'll check if it works I'm just used to doing turtle dot so generally it's good to go like something dot just let you know which libraries from but yeah good work we'll see if it works I'm just gonna quickly yeah so it's the same thing so that's fine also another way if you wanted to like shorten this into one line you could just go like import turtle as tick so that kind of does it all in one one if that makes sense yeah I think I get it yeah but either way yeah we just want to make one so that we can control it it doesn't really matter too much if you want to just go turtle dot forward and stuff but yeah anyway the next thing we want to do is we first wanna we wanna draw the circle but before doing that do you see how do you remember how in the example project it kind of did the circle but you couldn't really see the cursor and it did it pretty fast yeah yep so to do that we just want to change the speed of the turtle so that's just by going um like that's me but you don't need to write tick so you need to do tick so that it actually knows you're talking about the speed for the tip okay if that makes sense cuz in Python like you could also have your own method called speed like somewhere else so you just want to make sure that you're assigning the speed to that turtle element could you could you not what speed fifty speeds or a hundred even fifty one hundred something that's pretty far I got a great number okay that's good and then we just want to hide the cursor as well so to do that there's a function called high tidal yep almost hide turtle yeah where is it isn't it tick tock oh is it tick tock hi turtle yeah I'm pretty sure take the high tunnel we can check it and see what happens yes so the reason why we're doing the tick dot is because we're controlling like our little turtle though yeah um what do you what what you could do vote clean you just um not have the tick equal turtle yes so then instead of that you would just go like turtle dot speed and turtle dot hi turtle no pigs we've already imported turtle yep so the thing tick is like our own variable of a turtle like we've kind of made an object called tick is how we control it that's what you mean I start that we don't do we really need to I get sick because couldn't we just mean do you just want to go like speed and he√≠d turtle like that no yet we could do that couldn't move so generally because it's from it'll not the library I think you have to do the dot we can try it I'll just try it and see what happens because importing it just means like we can use all those libraries it knows what we're referring to but let's test it okay so I just tested it oh yeah okay that's my bad yeah so generally I just do the tick I like you know the turtle dot something just so that I know that I'm referring to the turtle but it works this way too so yeah so what we want to do is we want to we want to do our circle but we kind of need to map out where we'll start our circle from because at the end we want it like you know it draws a circle and then it draws the line you said to draw a circle you need the radius yep yep that first but also I mean like the position of where the turtle will be on the screen cuz right now if you run it I think the turtle starts off in the middle of the screen so if you draw the circle it might do it kind of off to the edge yeah if that makes it so we might need to move our turtle somewhere like to the side and then draw the circle you just go move turtle not exactly but before that we first need to think about so how big we want to make our circle just so that we know how much to move it off to the side so how big do you think we do maybe we could do a radius of 100 150 yep so let's just say 150 so what we can do is can move the turtle to the right 150 so I think I've Turtles automatically facing the right so we can just go forward 150 okay so but if we do this forward 150 it would draw the line on the screen so before making it go for pinup yeah so in this it's just called up oh wait how do you how come it's only up because it's just part of I think it's just generally because usually if you go like turtle up it's like total the up or total duck down pretty sure it's just off isn't it also polar I haven't tried pinup it could be both because pinup I'm always up we can check it and see could be both oh wait and I might be coming up million so I think you can do both plus I might be it might be confusing with scratch yeah so scratch it is pinup and pin down but sometimes there's also different versions of turtle so let me quickly find up so okay so there's like three different ways of doing it so you can go pen up PU flip n up or up so that all like they do the same thing but it's just a different way of different functions going it all right and it's the same foot down so yeah you can do either one so we do up then we do and then we want to move off to the side 150 okay then we do down yep down so now and I forgot how to draw the safe the circle yeah yep so it's just circle I'm pretty sure the function sorry so circle because there's an inbuilt function and then the radius 150 yep so what that will do is it will mean the circle is actually in the middle of the screen now it should be we'll test it and see what it looks like yes sir I have the same thing circle is not defined I think mine the circles a bit off wait did you did I spell it incorrectly or it could be that so how just double check the spelling Cir CLE see oh I forgot the RT yeah yeah the same thing it's a tiny bit oh yeah so I think the reason for that is we moved off to the side but then we were still facing that way so then it drew the circle from there whereas we should have started facing like to the top then it would have drawn the circle directly does that mean it now really if it is true so what it is is you know how the cursor like of the turtle faces this way usually to the right so we moved to the side 150 and then we drew the circle still facing the right so it did the circle like here yeah but what we wanted to do is we wanted to stop during the circle when we were facing the top so it drills a circle that way instead of me that way didn't have the same effect it I thought it would have I'm just trying to picture it well there's one way to find out we'll test it cuz I thought yeah it could just be that it's drawing it slightly off wait for right can't you just go RT right yeah I know I usually use right but it's probably both the same thing also sorry I accidentally closed my file but is it true why is it turn right over so I just use right and then you put in the degrees inside 19 wait it wouldn't be right it would be less no it's right it is right you're facing this way it would be let me it will be left yet sorry my accidentally closed my program we'll see if it works I have it I'm about to check it yeah and we have the thing in right in the middle right in the middle so the circles run in the middle okay yeah that's good yeah so I think the reason for that is because it was kind of already facing that direction it drew the circle towards our right instead of starting up from the beginning and drawing it more towards the left I might it might be easy if you draw it on a piece of paper so it's just the way it was facing because yeah it depends like where you draw the circle right so okay let me quickly add the right so what else must we do now okay so the next thing we want to do is do you remember how in the time of thing it drew the tick like from the middle yep so wanna go to the middle of our screen so we want to make sure curses in the middle of the screen said do you know what we would use middle row middle not exactly so use something with coordinates so we just want to make our cursor jump to a point on the screen so we can use set position so set position okay yep we drew a circle and then and then so the very middle of the screen is zero zero x coordinate and the y coordinate is zero well it doesn't start with the X yep starts with the X and then why it's a second Valley all right then then what must we do then what we must do is now we actually start like we need to start a loop and then we can drill okay yeah we need to start a loop and then we can start like drawing our line every second so it's you know it did a for loop or a so we want we want to make it happen forever so we'll do a while loop but just before that we'll just quickly check that our pen is in the right spot but so after your set position we'll just draw a straight line saying forward 150 just to check like before we start the loop that will it will draw where it's a coaster so because now we know the radius of the circle 150 should be like half that circle so we know that size so it's a good size keep drawing a line so it should draw the circle and then go to the middle and then drill 15 I'm going to check it as well mmhmm okay so might have done two lines did you do that too I don't think that's it yeah so yep I didn't still set position right okay okay this one's in rhythm I forgot the second so when you do it you might see two lines it's just because we forgot one yeah I have two lines that's weird yeah so the reason for that is the set position it drew it okay and then we didn't want to draw the line we just wanted to move it so they have to go pick up yep pin up and pin down but but what we wouldn't need to do that we always just a test right so it still need to do it for the set position we don't need the forward thing yet but because if we got rid of the forward it would still draw one line okay I should we don't want it to draw a line we just want to make sure it's that's in the middle so yeah we would go up and then down so now the cursor should be in the middle let's we hit the thing yep I have the line yeah you have the line to keep end of the line of you adding like weather angle and you can get the angle spot I look because you want to be constantly ticks we can use a while loop and we can just say while true so that means it will just happen Florida true and then now what you want to do is now you do the forward okay then we yes but exactly one degree because we're doing it according to time so think it's a different degree because if we do it if we turn one degree each time it will be like turning 360 lines um 360 divided by 60 so we can okay six yet it my thing kind of Rosa this explaining to you but yeah you can turn that then then just a timer right sleep yep sleep sleep and then one second but one thing is before you do the probably shouldn't matter too much but before you do the changing the degree we need to do something called Bob undo which would undo the line we just did it probably doesn't matter too much of the order um yeah I think undo just on just like Alaska man so you probably need to put under it under the last Helicon because the total thing so changing that degrees I found you if that makes I did just try yeah um there was a one problem what's the problem do you wanna share its we go it's not going back to the set position it's not going back to the set position okay like if I couldn't I think we have to put a set position in the while loop yeah we can try that so what was yours doing so far mine Judah line the middle yep turn six degrees but then it went out of the circle okay yes so the reason for that is did you have your undrew under no but wouldn't we still read so we could use that position but what we want to do is we want to drill a line and then undo it and then go on up the line and undo it but because I'm doing it is like an eraser okay exactly okay under function just like under gloss but maybe 150 so you wanted it it would go back to the same position was so yeah just undo yep so yeah that's it it stopped undo yeah you and you yeah okay yeah so what order did you type oh I go forward 150 the first line yeah 60 right sing sorry would you write write say by 6 yep so sleep one time dogs and then okay so what the undo thing does is it unders the last turtle function so because you did forward and then right it's undoing your turn six so it keeps just drawing the straight line so what you want to do is you want to go forward I think you're gonna sleep and then you want to undo that forward and then you want to turn right so turn like six degrees is the last thing you want to do or you could also just also just um you could do it now you could do it in a way the other way around just the other way around all right I lost it by turning right first and then let me like you could go 150 mmhmm undue and densely yep yeah that could work the only thing we can test it and see but if you do sleep after the undo you might not see your line for long enough if you want to make sure the line stays on for one second and then moves you can test it and see what happens close ok 100 it could still work because it's all in a loop anyway sorry my computer's a bit Rosen yep yep is it ice yep I see the problem so what's happening on yours the same thing you predicted okay yeah so sometimes it's like to test it and see what happens anyway because like they seemed like it wouldn't make a difference but surprisingly hate this my title Python kind of got frozen too ah what would you oh wait I should have the four times of sleep and then undo so yeah thank you yeah so that way it drills stays for a second and then under sit turns and then throws with him I'm not really sure but before what it did was it drew the line and then it kept on going again again I just straight okay now no it did that two times before yeah it is working now yeah okay that's good yes so the first reason it was doing that it kept going straight was because you were undoing the angle thing because I think you did forward and then you did right six degrees and then you did undo so undo instead of undoing forward like you thought it would it was undoing turn six degrees so I just kept going forward wait a second forward wait a second wait a second does that make sense so okay now I get it oh it only under the last okay yeah sorry for not making that clear yes undo it's just part of total just as the last thing so that's why the order does matter um a way you could do this more complicated mmhmm would you be able to just like you would be able to ask them how much time they would like divide it and made an angle that much yeah you could do that like a time a kind of thing yeah yeah that would that could work and so thank you did you want to start on the next thing yeah so did that make sense to you yep yep okay cool so that's just like one way how you can use the time let me get the next thing open do wait do we need a timer or no so now we're gonna learn like something else so you can close that file I'm going to open a new file if you want okay so have you done much on lists yes yes have you done a lot of it oh just like really I have done some any okay well we'll go through it and then if you have done it we can just go through it you want sorry I do remember now ya want me to show you which one is it I actually am having a bit of problems like it's the same also if you want that sharing this thing thank you what were you saying sorry okay here we go yep here can you see that it's just loading yep I can see okay have a look at this mmhmm that's we run it okay so this is actually dictionary that's like the mixedup optimist under an english word or phrase so I can just go like in peace it that is how you spell peace right yep like pieces in like peace yep yeah yep oh let's see okay oh that's weird and in yeah that's like that's my problem too in isn't going good yeah that's a hot year um and let me have a look at you'll see have a dictionary where key phrase equals please enter an English word look great again I copy this one from the book okay um I added my own thing for one a part of it oh yeah do you mind if I just try to run it again yeah that's fine it seems like you should look because it shouldn't be picking up the innards like code okay I'm running it I might just let me have a look if I can do this one just hello right and it's a I just want to learn how to say hello enter it's not taking my enter I think I'm saying is it could be stuck on something on this input please enter an English word keyword equals III uhhuh window so then the next step you do is you open like a TK into window that open somewhere else when you ran that I don't think so because then after that the only place where you print something is like that line towards the bottom yeah yeah I don't think so I wanna say things if I guess right hello the problem is it's not at a nose pops up it's just say you know if I could keep on pressing enter okay cuz okay one reason if we go back into your code it's like after you have the input thing the only thing you do with that like you try to open the TK into window and then the only other place where you print something is in an on click event do you see how you have the print in robot say and then you have that work line there oh I see the problem yeah so if you try to print something straight off the input what do you need to just go on click like that so yeah so I think what this is doing is the onclick is trying to detect it from TK inter yeah TK inter but your TK inter thing is an opening properly I know my problem is that I only defined a TK enter I never used yeah look at this I said it's it's in my program is still running that's a weird thing a must trying to do something the background here it says define on click event all right okay so and you made your own event right on click event what if I did this would it work so what do you use event is said remember we're talking about parameters yes yes so inside the bracket on click event it's kind of like a parameter but I guess it's like an onclick perimeter okay there we go okay so now if you press the button it should yeah okay yeah yeah so you were right about you just want calling the function okay yeah okay cool okay yeah so yeah that's dictionaries but we can go through lists really quickly couple of minutes left but since you've done lists it should be pretty easy for you there's like that you know that to do that to do little program I showed you before yeah if you if like you don't find a list too easy we can do with that like the first lesson next week we'll see how it goes so I'll just share my screen again so can you see my screen and your screen as well no my second thing okay yep I should have it yep so just for now we'll stay on show on Python shell oh just a couple of stuff and then we can move on okay see the time cuz there's only a couple minutes few minutes left but yeah so do you know what a list is like if you had to explain one yes oh this is like that it's like a variable that contains more than one item yeah pretty much yeah so it's kind of like a variable that has multiple items so for example you could have something like a shopping list yep so you give it the name and then do you know how you would make a list yeah I do believe so look like shopping mmhmm I know you can see my screen but yeah the equal sign and then you know square brackets yep exactly so good job and then you would just put your items in so how would you put your items in okay you would you could you could you use some text the speech bubble yeah yeah so in this case I'm just making in a text list so just add a couple of add a couple of items thing eggs good just as an example and now we've made our list shopping so list they can have strings in it but they can also have numbers and stuff as well by the way do you know how to stay on the cell yeah be able to write a more than one line code um I'm not a hundred percent sure let me try it could be if you liked type control until all just I'm not a hundred percent sure about that sorry let me quickly check up and see while I'm looking that up have you heard of index and stuff with lists yes a ablation yep so if you wanted to get like X if you wanted to print eggs what would you need to type in print eggs you would have to like from bonus for me eggs is first okay yep so for your listen you would have to add in print show me then the to the square the square brackets with the index one for me and zero for you almost the other way around okay but yeah here for me and one for you yep it's a good job and then it prints it out yep and then have you heard of a pen oh how you do it it stays there yeah so if you just press yeah so you can do multiple lines by just pressing enter so like I made shopping and then if I press ENTER it's still no shopping is there okay as long as you don't close show is that what you were asking yeah all right sorry I thought you just wanted to write like a lot of code at once no that no that was what I was asking oh okay but azan does this answer your question yeah that a different way a different solution yeah I was thinking I was thinking yes it yeah it's a different solution to what I was expecting but it still works okay yeah so you were thinking only did one line at a time and that's all it remembers kind of oh wait I don't know why this is pretty weird I you know I just clicked enter and I'm not having a neat yeah this sort of an area does it say anything goes it just no it's treating shell as a file oh okay um do you want to quickly share your screen so I can see what it looks like so have you pressed until wait I forgot it here we go racket no okay yes yes also it's the end of the lesson now I'll quickly ask you heavy head of the pending before with lists yes appen yep so what does that do you know what it does adds a word to the list and then do you know how where where does it add it on the list the end yep yeah cool and then if you wanted to remove something do you know what you would use delete shopping index kinda but you can use something called doctrine like there's something called remove so you can just go like shopping doctor move and then if you want to remove eggs you type in eggs so you can quickly try it now remove this you can either do it like by the word eggs oh wait whoopsie you're not too good but what's the one thing I can see is check your bracket so the square brackets I'll just use like for making lists and forgetting like the index all the lists okay but because like append functions and then if you just want to see your result you just type in shopping yeah you have to go print out shopping in Python show you don't need to do it okay so if you just type in shopping and enter it'll do it as a list so it'll come up with like the square brackets and everything if you did print and then shopping it would it wouldn't have those square brackets remove mmhmm and now you can just see the result Oh shopping yep cool yeah and so I'll just leave it as that you pretty much know about lists that I think next week we can move on to the next topic but did you have any questions about anything we did today I don't think so no that's good mmm what's the like layout of the class okay for you do you find that you did you find that you still learn new stuff today yes the time ends up okay that's good on you okay that's the main thing okay well anyway I shall see you next week see you bye
