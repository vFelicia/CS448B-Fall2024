welcome to coding kids today I'm going to show you how to build this game night collect the coins in the castle first let's look at how we play it the player controls the night by pressing the up down left and right arrow keys to make the night move around the screen the aim of the game is to collect all the coins and the money bag by touching them with the night when you collect all the coins and the money bag you win however you also need to avoid running into the ghosts because if you touch the ghosts you lose now let's build the game there are seven parts to the game 1 the backdrop to the night three the ghosts for the coins 5 the money bag 6 you win and 7 you lose now let's start building one step at a time first let's start with a brand new project by clicking the create button on the home page as you can see a new project will open with the cats bright as the default sprite a sprite is a character or object that we use in making the computer program let's delete the cat's bright so step one let's add the backdrop click on the miniature backdrop icon at the bottom of the screen then scroll through the backdrop library until you find a backdrop that you like you may choose a different backdrop to me double click on the backdrop you have selected to set it as your backdrop now our game has a backdrop title this backdrop as castle for step two let's import a new sprite into our workspace select a new sprite from the sprite library I want to use the nite sprite but you may choose to use a difference bright to me you can resize the sprite to make it bigger or smaller if you like I want my sprite to be a bit smaller to do this use the shrink icon in the toolbar at the top and click on the sprite until it's the size that you want now we want to add some code to our nite sprite to do this make sure the night is selected and then open the scripts tab which is at the top center of the page near the stop sign we need all night to move when we press the arrow keys to do this let's use the blog when space key pressed drag four of these blocks into the workspace now click on the drop down arrow to change the space key to left arrow key right arrow key up arrow key and down arrow key for each of these event blocks now we need to add the motion blocks to these event blocks we know that to move up and down we use the y axis and to move left and right we use the x axis to make the night move up with the up arrow we need to choose a block that saves change Y by 10 from the motion category now connect it to the blocks that says when up arrow key pressed to activate it let's test it out it works repeat this for each of the arrow keys but make sure to remember the down and left use negative 10 in the motion block instead of positive 10 let's test our code great it works now we can move the night around the screen for step 3 we're going to create and close our ghost sprite first let's import a new sprite into our workspace I will select a new sprite from the sprite library I want to use the ghost sprite but you may choose to use a difference bright to me the ghost sprite is a bit different to the nite sprite because the ghost sprite isn't controlled by a player instead the motion of the ghost is automated meaning it happens all by itself we want our ghost to move as soon as the game begins to do this drag the event block when green flag clicked into the workspace now we need to code how the ghost will move the ghost sprite is moving forwards but turning randomly between each movement to code for this let's grab a move 10 steps block and put it under the when green flag clicked block next select a turn clockwise block and put it under the move 10 steps block instead of getting our sprite to rotate 15 degrees we want it to randomly choose between rotating 5 degrees clockwise or negative 5 degrees clockwise this is also known as 5 degrees anticlockwise to do this let's get the pic random one to 10 block from the operators category and change the numbers to negative 5 and 5 to make sure the ghost sprite continues to move for the duration of the game let's put a forever loop which is found in the control category over our blocks next let's make sure the ghost won't disappear when it's on a to do this add the block if homage bounce inside the forever loop and then a day wait one second from the control category to control the speed the ghost moves at I will change my waiting time to not point 15 seconds finally let's give our ghost a starting point to do this use the motion block go to X Y my ghost will start at x equals 190 y equals 138 let's test our code great our ghost moves just like we want it to 4 sep four we're going to create and code for our coin sprites first let's draw a new sprite to do this go to the paintbrush icon located next to the sprite library icon to paint a coin draw a circle with the circle feature and then add a dollar sign the coin sprites are objects that we collect during the game to give us points they can do this because we have assigned the variable money to them to create a variable go into the data category and click on the maker variable let's call this variable money and click ok make sure you can see a checkmark next to the variable money this makes sure we can see our score during the game now that we have created the variable money let's start coding for how our night and coins interact with each other in the game the variable money only increases when the night touches the coin after the night touches the coin the coin disappears first we need a when green flag clicked block to start our code next we want to find an ifthen loop from the control category this allows us to make a decision about when our score will increase as we only want our score to increase if the night is touching the coin too close for this select the block called touching night from the sensing category and put it into the top of the ifthen block now we can put what we want to happen if I might is touching the coin inside our if then loop we want the variable money to increase by 1 and we want the coin to hide to do this find the block change money by one in the data category and hide from the looks category and then put them inside the if vens loop we need a forever loop around our if then loop to ensure that the condition is being checked continuously you can find the forever loop in the control category finally to make sure we can see our coin when we restart the game add a show blog finney see when green flag clicked block let's test our code great our coin disappears and our score increases by 1 when the night touches the coin now we have one coin that works we want to duplicate our coin so that we can have five coins to do this select the stamp icon at the top of the screen and click on the coins bright do this four times to create five coin sprites now we have five sprite but all of them are randomly positioned on the screen to make sure they go where you want a day go to X Y block to each coin make sure the coordinates are unique for each of them so they aren't on top of each other so step 5 we're going to create and code for our money bag sprite first let's draw a new sprite to do this go to the paintbrush icon located next to the sprite library icon use the paintbrush to create a money bag shape the code for our money bag is almost exactly the same as the code for our coins so we can use some of our code from before to create our money bag code first let's copy the code we used for our coin sprite to do this open a coin sprite and drag the code down to hover over the money bag sprite drop it on the money bag sprite this plus the code from the coin into the money bag workspace now we need to change the amount our money bag changes for variable money by because the money bag is worth more than the coins change the one in it change money by 12 a5 we also need to change the position of our money bag so that it is unique change the coordinates in the go to X Y blog so that they are different to all of your coins for step 6 we're going to create the backdrop for you win and code for how that happens first select the stage image located in the bottom lefthand corner now go to the backdrops tab and right click on your current backdrop click on duplicate so you can have a copy of your original backdrop now add the text you win to this picture by using the text function title this backdrop you win now open up the script tab again and drag out a when green flag clicked block you can only win the game if you have collected all of the coins and the money bag when you have collected all the items the variable money will be equal to 10 to code this let's use an if then loop and an equal block from the operator category drag the equal block into the top of the ifthen loop inside the equal block drag the block money from the data category and in the other side type 10 now we can code for what happens when the variable money equals 10 when money equals 10 you win add the block change backdrop to you win from the looks category and underneath the block stop all from the control category make sure you put a forever block around the ifthen loop so that the condition is always being checked and lastly add the block switch backdrop to Castle and set money 20 Vinny see when green flag clicked block 4 step 7 we're going to create the backdrop for you lose and code for how that happens first select the stage image located in the bottom lefthand corner now go to the backdrops tab and right click on your current backdrop click on duplicate so you can have a copy of your original backdrop now add the pegs you lose to this picture by using the text function title this backdrop you lose now select your nite sprite and drag a when green flag clicked block into the workspace just like for the you win scenario the you lose scenario only happens if the ghost is touching the night therefore we need them if then lube and a touching ghost blog click these two blocks together and place them under the event blog inside of our if loop we want to use the switch backdrop to you lose blog found in the looks category place this block inside the if then loop when you lose the game all motions should stop therefore we also want the stop all blog found in the control category put this underneath switch backdrop finally we want our condition to be checked forever so add a forever loop around the ifthen loop now let's click on the green flag to test our game great it works add your own features like music or timers to personalize the game
