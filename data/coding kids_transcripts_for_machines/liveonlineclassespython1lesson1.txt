he's just getting it for me too hard doing it without I think this online things to her I asked her asked me to share this screen this is you've done actually I think you know how to share because how to share this screen in zone so the first six if you remember you found so go in yep I'm the share icon yeah browser whatever you have Firefox is just use one of those one of the screen that you want to share with me and then click there can you see it now I just appreciate it oh did you it doesn't show me yeah it's show me okay cool I say yeah pick something that's it okay so I'm with you Raj playing start to write down whatever we're going to ask title to preach some words for us like hello or some numbers way it's not right print yeah and project and say a number say a I'm eight they know the result came time eight multiple eight they start in shift and eight yeah okay let's see what's the result you will see yeah 728 and go and print and statements like like tell me a crystal structure brackets the M everything's will go into print it should be in bracket yes okay State man we need to if you remember we need to use quotation restate the quotation yeah exactly I then say what where you like to say okay so you learn how to use how to put numbers and statements so after that I'm going to share my screen and show you so could you see my screen now he's not you should stop your share let's show you on the top on the top of the desk up you will see you should press stop right yes I did it oh cool now you can see my screen so I'm going to use variable you know very well is something that you can is it like box everything is like your toys you put your toys you put your cards toys in the box and you put the name on it you say you put the now they say exactly what's in the box for later to use like if you have in your box just your car's told toys you will just write down cards we have here we have what we call it variable that means you we can store us where we need and then we it again so we have this we have something that we call like let's see I like to say let's say messy toys I call it with this one and if this name whatever doesn't matter and then I say I'm gonna pick some numbers in my box like I have the number 10 in my box so I score it and then if I print messy toys could you guess what we can have if I run it what do you mean so bye bye run the prints so when I ask whatever I have in messy toys box here or what we have in my seat toys number 10 even I can add or I can put the other numbers like so we I destroy whatever I had here before and then I put away say a card that it's called just just name let's say hello so at the end we have when I asked pointing to print this variable for me what week and a half here I don't know yes here is saying what the last things we put in my seat or a spokes oh yeah like 10 23 and hello yeah but yeah but just for now that's late the last things are put in messy toys because I put out 10 and 23 out of the box and put hello inside the box oh but we can add later beyond the stabby can learn how to add everything's in a box so for now we just can't add mountains in the same time we couldn't add everything in a park for now but later on we can learn how to add lots of things in the same box so for now we have Josh so let's see what we have yes say if I change it to do or say let's change it to you and then you will see me whenever I change what we have here when a little change and create it so maybe change it doesn't I don't pinch here so I keep the name here and then don't change whatever I have in the box so let's see what do you like to see would you like to do it in your screen and show me and share your screen with me okay we're gonna try it to make sure we understand how to share okay good job put the name on your box whatever you like and then put something inside you know I just add something else and you can in this then you should say equal right just strangled actually equal cars yep I'm going now you can use the box so what's what's the name of your box use that one I'm a nice toys say please like always don't forget to use definitely but don't forget to use this structure the syntax that we use so free that always used to bracket homework you will see the cords red yellow yellow because if you use quotation if you change what you have inside the a notorious box for example say no don't we don't change the variable so just keep there yeah keep the name okay once you have inside the box so we have cars if you change it to something else it's gonna print it's gonna show us different things say we you have food so it's deleted what you had before you had cars and now you have phones so you could have the cars and okay what's the character I would send some some different things for you much stop sharing could you see what I sign to your chat thing always you don't don't delete anything in your code so just at this line after before please because last month so before last time at this line you can see we add you keep what you have before in the box and then just add some locals inside the box so that's definitely we can whatever and then add different things in the box by saying class did you get me yes okay cool oh I can see you now Stephan sorry we we not finished the last session now but just wait thank you Aneesh can I talk to your mom because we already finished the session if you'd like to continue the mom can help we're going to enjoy you in the sessions when I talk to your mommy Hey okay we already talked

whatever I sent and the things that we already actually start heightened career so he knows about how the variable work we can print some things that we asked from tighter I yeah if you and so the things that now if you like to continue yeah sent you the range that you can go on go true and send it by chat here go through and select horse is stuck in our to the Cramton even with more where they want you to tighten but just said see which days it's suitable for you okay can you see is not no I think you should be figure out yeah exactly yeah maybe does know if you just check it there is in
