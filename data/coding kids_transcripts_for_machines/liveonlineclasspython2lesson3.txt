a little thing on the top saying this is being recorded all right but yeah other than that you can't continue okay so for now wait I'm just gonna see if I can use yeah I can see that it's like a little red door thing recording yep yeah and share here we go the whole iPhones si but now it's just green yep yep a screen and it's just loading up yep okay cool I can see it mmhmm I took chains is a bit might have change of it that's okay mmhmm it looks good so far it looks pretty good to me so have you test it as well and get people on it if you want I can show you sure it looks like it works but just just have a look at it all right here we go and then you can just continue playing it yeah and that's I warded this time like that just it okay please try again and then you just type it there yes I actually type it this time cool looks good to me um does it all make sense to you as well yeah if it seems yeah it looks pretty easy yeah yep okay that's good yes I might move you on to the other topics possibly this was also just the revision that I'll see if you know any of like what we're gonna do today if you do we can like move on to a different level let me just open if it's possible will we be doing anything like sort of drawing drawing so have you done anything with turtle have you heard of turtle turtle yes but if I can say I mean I'm talking about more a bit like TK inter and Kansas okay so I'm not sure if that's unlike these lesson plans let me just have a look and see how much you know the other stuff yeah give me one second let me just have a look yeah cuz I'm not sure we do TK inter with this class but we could try have a look at it let me see what have you learned about things like functions and stuff yeah I yeah yes I've done that before you've done that before okay um let me go through the other stuff as well have you let me get it open so what kind of drawing were you thinking of like with tea game well I didn't like necessarily jory but just sort of the game that might be able to have some sort of background and some sort of right yep okay I get you if you want I can show you another program I did following a book yeah yeah sure that would be good just so I can get an idea stuff you know which one was it there we go that's wanna hold it open with it should come up in a bit okay that's fine sometimes takes a couple of seconds to load and I think it's a bit slow because I'm watching you scratch shared screen as well maybe I should just trigger yeah I can see it loading right there we go okay so this one was using a book Memphis and I'm getting most of it I've added some color as well than to what the book says uncle also you're following like a book about Python yeah and I've added some of my own things okay that's pretty cool and if you click this white yes white is the French of this way there's some clear everything but I had a sort of a logic bug that includes the buttons as well yeah looks good so far so um that was just you following a book was it yeah that's pretty impressive do you understand everything that's happening in that program most of it most of it okay like most of it I can get okay that's cool it's like I think the one I don't really understand it just these numbers those numbers are in work sort of okay so I think I'm pretty sure it's kind of like a grid system oh it's just like the location yeah sure how your location works that's how it works right I think I figured out the pattern so that's how I keep adding on more colors oh yeah if I were to start from scratch about the book I wouldn't be able with that okay yeah cool well that looks pretty cool I'm just checking if like we have any TK inter stuff I'm not a hundred percent sure if we do I think um some of the games we do we make it with and let me try open it up and see what it looks like I think we make it mole with turtle and it makes gamelike stuff but let me just have a look but also have you worked with things like timers and first pardon time is sorry in Python no not really sure that would be good to do okay because what I'm thinking is because like you kind of want to make an interactive game but what our lessons kind of do is they teach you like the fundamentals of Python yeah they're kind of build on on like what you've done before so I was just thinking for today we can like work on something that you haven't learnt yet but then I'll check also if we have any other TK into stuff for next week but because generally it's good to know like these fundamental stuff cuz I'm later on when you make more complex games you have this like basis knowledge it's like you feel making a game you can like add things like time is and you know like all these other different Python things does that sound okay to you yeah okay okay so I'll just note it down and I'll get back to you about the TK into stuff but for now I'll see like what you haven't learnt and then we can start like learning that stuff too let me start with so you said you've done some stuff with functions right yes yep does it all make sense to you yeah I believe so wait did you want me to open yeah sure yeah and while you're doing that do you wanna try explain to me what a function does but there okay there can be some functions mmhmm but you can also create your functions yep what you do with the functions is it's sort of this stuff it just allows you to not have to repeat the same code several times yep exactly and good job and then you know do you know how to make a function I saw you used it before but I believe so just yeah I can't seem to find my first place nice can you just type it in yeah I don't get okay here we go like I'll just go I know I see what you mean yes I don't like no that seems really weird is it not showing up what if we just tried yeah okay okay did you not installed it on this one I found it ah he found it on top for somewhere should have still showed up when searching looks a bit unusual all right there we go I wrote it over you got it cool okay let me just try to get something up to quickly show you just give me a couple of seconds sorry give me one second yeah I do admit I don't totally remember how to use a function okay that's okay so I'll quickly go over that and then we can move on to the next thing so yeah had it okay so you have idle open let me just give it up so I'll just show you an example of how to do the functions with Tuttle so do you remember turtle and how like they have the dot forward and dark circle and stuff I know what turtle you can know yeah they go forward or using pixels and they can turn yeah yeah so I'll just quickly show you so I'll get you to the dude remember how to use turtle you know yeah I believe and then what you need to do is you need to create your actual little turtle like icon thing did you have your turtle hook great um oh so it's not actually the word create sorry so you have to like give you a total a name so like you could call it Bob Oh golly Oh something you didn't like the variable so you just go like bub equals okay yep doesn't importing turtle already sort of do that yeah so it does but what we're doing is we're just making like our little turtle case with like a different name yep you can import turtle and then say like you could just use turtle actually yeah I think it probably wouldn't make much of a difference so then dr8 just equals turtle dot yep and then turtle dot and then turtle with a capital T after that and I'm open and close brackets yep jusjust me right outside the curved brackets okay one neither nine and zero well okay don't put a normal brackets oh yeah yep and so that's just created the total really quickly so then you can just go you can change colors can't you yeah so you can change colors yeah one thing I was saying is like there's a function so like you know how you have saying functions it's like a bit of code which you can just repeat here like turtle already has like a whole bunch of inbuilt functions so like they have something called circle so you can go like Liam duck circle and then in brackets again so just the normal how big it will be yep so inside that you have to put how big it will be but how do you I mean so do you know how it shapes like in circles there's a radius sorta is not just like from that side to this side so it's like like with the circle it's like that line which is like kind of like half the size okay yeah yeah so the rate for example could be 50 pixels yeah and then what you can do is you can just run it so that number inside the brackets that's called a parameter have you heard of that before something called a parameter I do believe so sometimes it's basically like in a method or function you can like use numbers that people like the user inputs or like that we kind of put in and then you can like change it depending on that so like in this case it's like drawing a circle but like instead of inside the function having the circle always had a set size like you can change the size by changing that parameter so I'll just quickly let you run it there we go so yeah so it drew the circle so anyway that was just like intro to title but the point I was trying to make is that's a function you know the like turtle has a function called circle so what we can quickly do just to quickly like refresh your memory on functions is we'll make our own function but this time to draw a square so what we can do is there's something cold so we have to like create a definition in Python so yes sir okay I think I remember now yeah so what are just typing des yeah I remember yep so that's kind of like defining the function where isn't it diff square actually yes it's def square square and then you have your brackets and then wait don't you need to put something like a and B so you don't have to so that's what as I'm explaining those are parameters so for example if you wanted it to always be like the same set size you don't need to put any parameters you can just draw the square at like 100 pixels by 100 pixels but if you wanted to be able to change it so like how we do it circle then you need to put a parameter in so it doesn't have to be a or B it can just be any word so like we could call it side length or something so if you just type that in as one word yep so what that is is it means we can use that it's kind of like a variable and we can use that variable to draw our shape and then that variable would just depend on like what the person types in inside the brackets does that make sense yeah okay so what we need to do next is actually draw the square like physically with turtle so to draw a square what do we need to actually draw we just we would have to go liam dot square so without doing square cuz we're actually making this function okay you want to do it like kind of from scratch just to get an idea so like doing it with like lines and turning but like when you think about it like how would we draw a square what do we need we need four so forward this is where we can use our variable or that parameter called side length yep so instead of giving it like a set size of going like for water like 50 pixels we can actually use that word side blade so then later when we call that function you can just change the number yeah yep yes we we drill like we go forward and then what do we do this simply yeah okay this one's just 90 or ready yep so it's just 90 because it's a square and then because this is a square how many times do we need to do that we we need to do the first one that's highlighted four times mmhmm and the bottom one we only actually need to do three times make sure yeah but some people do can do it four times just to make it go back but yeah yeah three times but another thing instead of actually copying and pasting those bit of those lines like four times what's the last the way we could do it do you know oh we just be copying the whole thing like that but instead of like having heaps of lines of code like a way to make it shorter like so do you remember what we could do to like repeat it mmm so have you used loops and Python oh yeah yep yeah of course yeah so it it just makes it easier so that instead of having like a whole lot of code in our file like instead of having eight lines or seven lines we would just have that little bit of code should you remember how to do the loop in Python yes it what do you want this to be a while loop or for loop um so follow but yelling yeah because we just want to loop through that point of code four times so we did it for X in for yep but you might just need to do it for X in range for okay so yeah it's just saying like a range from a range of four and then don't forget to indent the other stuff and then you can just get rid of that second dot forward it flowed mmhmm so now like what you have in your function so this is kind of defining the function and it's just basically telling like the code to actually draw a physical square but now to actually use that function we have to do it like how we kind of do the circle thing yeah wait dude except oh sorry what we gonna say can you just write square side length it doesn't have to be turtle dot squares right yep so because you made this function you just go square side length instead of like turtle duck yeah the reason the turtle dot thing is that is because it's part of that turtle library but because you made this yourself yeah you just write this time I don't write sign laughs I can write for example 200 yep exactly and then I just go run no that was the first several okay yeah yeah so does that make sense of how to make a function yes yeah and then you can keep like repeating that so you could go like square and then you can make a smaller square after that so like an square 200 you know like square 100 and then the little two squares so it just saves you from like having to repeat that bit of code all the time how small would this be just my curiosity might just look like a little dot I guess we'll find out yeah no it's pretty small you get very tiny it's very tiny but they're four pixels coloredin yeah yeah that's pretty cool it's smaller than the cursor yeah so yeah so does that all make sense to you yes yep and does that side length thing make sense to you as well yes yep so that's called a parameter so basically you can just change like that number it's kind of like a variable but in a function so without you oh sorry what are you gonna say yes right you're continuing I was just gonna say like without you having to make a function that's like a square of 100 pixels each side it can like change depending on the user so what may I just ask yeah would it help you if I showed you more of the things I did yeah sure yeah because there are other things that I did mmhmm like to see okay wait I have to go like this oh yeah so the reason why I was just going through this is just to check that you know what it does because I can see that you've used it but just to check that yeah like you can understand it himself that's all I am see you've already done something similar yeah Oh George six of them of the snuggly thing yeah okay that's pretty cool yeah so that one uses similar concepts and if you would just like to see one that's completely about parameters yeah this I believe this one would be perfect oh wait no I'm not even sure see all right here we go there you go so mmhmm it's it's not okay honestly not yeah it does do sort of it does use parameters yeah yeah yeah I can see quite a few parameters but yeah yeah I just wanted to doublecheck that you oh like you understood what all the functions and parameters was about I can quickly move on to have you learned to like write to a file and stuff as well in Python to a file yeah so like writing things to a file no no okay that's okay so I'm like great to learn that will be great to learn okay so I think that's actually in a couple of weeks but like I'll quickly go through these so you could probably power through them but the next thing I'll do is timeless so again I'm just let me know if it is too easy for you but I'm just going through these because then you have like a basic understanding of what Python can do and then you know like more of what Python can do yeah so that you're able to make more complex and things but yeah so what I'll get you to do is open up another Idol window whatever you if I just deleted this one I don't know that's why it's up to you yeah yo program so you can change it there we go okay so just to double check do you know what a library is in Python I'm not really okay so I think I'm not I know you can have dictionaries and lists but nothing okay so I think you know like you use libraries before so I turtle and there's like random and stuff that already oh yeah so then modules so yeah they're pretty much the same thing so the timer also has its own module so it's called time so the first thing you need to do is import time yeah I think I've tried doing a code on this but that didn't really work okay well let me know if it sounds familiar as we go on okay yep if not we can move on to the next topic so yeah so we have time and what we like you can do various things with time so one thing you can do is like like we can find out what the current time is so to do that you go so do you remember in libraries how you gotta go something done and then a function or we have to go time dot and then you have to type in a SC hey C time yep and then the brackets just the normal but how would you know which country you're in I'm not a hundred percent sure on that I think you could probably change it but I think what it does is it probably gets it from your computer yeah possibly that's a good question we can try look it up and see but yeah I think you could probably change the timezone but I think like when you like install Python and stuff it sets it up so if I were to just click run now it would show me the time it could but one thing you might need to do is to actually you might need to print it if that doesn't work yeah yeah I know that was my fault for not telling you sir like the print in breathitt yeah I forgot you ready yeah I thought it might over but maybe not I might walk in the show oh yeah it probably would just work in the show oh yeah it's very specific yeah so it couldn't sell like the whole date time and everything is it the correct time yeah I do believe so 624 does that say 600 okay wait wait it's done the seconds as well yeah so it's really specific so that's why I'm like with this time thing when like when you make more complex games you can actually like have timers in it and stuff so like that's how you create timers you kind of get the current time and then you make a timer and then you base the seconds off that so how do you create a timer dinner um okay let me double check how to do that so to create a timer in Python you might need to make a variable give me a second let me just quickly check up on this I don't want to tell you the wrong thing okay to give me one second while you're waiting another thing you can try is instead of a SC time there's another thing called local time for el trato yes yeah I gave her 8 remember reading a book that said we're different oh yes I think they are similar but there are some slight differences there I think because there it's one of those funny books that talks about science and funny stuff at the same time oh yeah they're talking about it for an excuse to come late to school oh okay here we go it says the what does that say there's an hour 18 26 minutes no it seems to be the same actually yes oh I think what this is it's the same but it's like kind of set up differently so like it's kind of split differently do you see how it's like they're like you know how the other one just printed the time straightaway yeah this kind of breaks it up so what I think what you can do with this local time is you can actually just extract certain bits from it so instead of getting like that whole like date time seconds you could just get the time well you can just get the seconds or just get a minute it's like time don't our time maybe yes I think let me find the exact specifications I'm pretty sure you have to type something in those brackets in local time yeah doesn't seem to work yeah let me find it for you it works hey I closed it yes so I'm pretty sure there's something like if you type in like a capital y or something you can get like the year let me try find it for you let me see if it's awesome I'm just gonna go turn on some other in line oh yeah sure that's why just let me know when you're hopefully that's better for you yeah I can't actually see your face and I couldn't see your face okay yes that's better my screen was small so I couldn't see okay let me get back to what I was telling you so the certain parameters that you can get to get like the specific like things like seconds and stuff from the time so I'm just trying to find the exact one you're like what what about it gave us some options if we just the answer and we write something proof or a so I think you still have to go like local time possibly and then inside the brackets you might need to type something to try the nfe you might need to percentage them and so yep doesn't work doesn't seem to have yeah our let's write out I think that's also thing called just seconds and years and stuff you be and then how do you see yeah I don't see but then from here for example just a little later mmhmm okay that's back of it so did you have a question before no it's it wait so did you figure out how to actually do a timer yes so I found one thing let me so what you could do is okay let me just check I think timers are a bit more complex because there's like a few more things you need to do but I might can I show you what I believe a time yeah sure I believe you can do a timer like it might actually okay here we go oh that one yes so that's one way you can do it and then you can just and then it comes in seconds you can go like 60 seconds yeah so that's one way you can do the time I like to actually like wait and then do something so like you know how have you done scratch okay yeah I see what you mean yes I've done screw okay kind of like that wait book okay so you mean if you want to run something at the same time oh if you want to run something at the same time so wait what what was your okay no what I was saying was like it's kind of like in scratch do you know that wait something book one like wait yeah yeah so that's why I shouldn't say like the sleep one is just like wait so just like you can do something and you can wait a bit and do something else so say your head what are you thinking about then were they the more complex one which one is it so I thought you were wanting to know about like timers like on the screen like a time yes possibly let me try find it for you because I was finding some options I think you can do them differently let me something else up give me a second yeah cuz with time is like I think like usually you can use the sleep thing cuz you can just wait yeah actually you could probably use a sleep thing and then what you could do is like if you wanted to set a timer on the screen you could just have like a variable cold like the time account and you can use sleep so for example if you just wanted like a timer like a sector like a second time or that counts like 1 2 3 4 that kind of thing you could just make a variable so we can try it now ok so you can make a variable called like seconds something oh you can call it whatever you want and then you started off at 0 and then you just have like your while loop like a forever like a loop that would go on forever so you can just type in something like while true take second while oh no sorry so seconds would still have to start off at 0 and then the next line would be the while loop sorry okay I get it okay so we just create a variable and then now what we want to do is in a loop we always want to show that variable but we want to make it bigger so you can go well true yeah and inside that loop you can go like you can just keep adding one two seconds like you could go to do you know how you would do that print yeah so print second and then after that you'd need to increase seconds said you know how you do that yeah mmhmm yep and then just buy one and then because we want it to happen every one second you need to actually use that sweet function okay mmhmm leap and then just remember you need something in that sleep in the brackets okay yeah I need to tell it how long we need to see one second yep now if you run it so this is actually a more easier way to do a timer it's like do you see how it's counting down the seconds yeah I see does that make sense so like something you can do with that is if I just quickly share my screen you'll have to stop sharing no it's okay when I share my screen it just stopped seals automatically so can you see my screen no I see black you see black but it has told me that you started to share okay yep and I see it okay okay so what you can do with like that second kind of timer that we did just now is you could make like a thing like a clock so I'll just show you like once it loads so with turtle you can kind of have like a ticking cup clock dudes can you see my screen so well how did you do that one yeah yeah so do you want to work on that now Johanna H over that okay yeah that's fine that's like the next part of what is gonna show you anyway and does that seem interesting to you yes yeah okay so I'm gonna stop sharing my screen again and you can share you thank you so this just uses a combination of what we just did before by like creating that variable kind of thing so this time it doesn't have the variable we just use the sleep function and wait sir can you see my screen yeah I can see it's me this is one of the programs I did it was just basically trying to get a clock oh yeah trying to get a clock on to walk and did it whoa when you rent it oh did it do anything if you wanna can show you it's not it's not totally working look what is the hour for example it's six minutes it's free seven six forty seven but it doesn't seem to be working okay so what did you want it to do oh I just I'm just trying to be able to just print every minute the new clock okay so like 637 638 yes that kind of thing yeah as in minutes or seconds sorry its minutes okay oh so you kind of want to like create a clock and then yeah the next minute has 10 like changed okay so one way you could do that is kind of like what we did before so you know how we had the seconds thing before we made that variable the seconds so you could kind of do it like that yeah can I ask is this isn't this what we have done okay let me look a while to print a oh wait or did I do it in the wrong order Oh a minutes sleep one B plus a equals one please a plus B if B is equal to 60 Hey okay so it looks kind of right let me have a closer look I do I do see some mistakes in here but yeah so much beer days look but they look like the logic ones not yeah so if you just run it again what's the error that you can do it let's check looking at that we'll just stick it quickly ok string not int okay so it's Gordon it's it's like it's managed to get up to right there so I know what the issue is sorry okay you know that input line of code yes is the user like when you type something in it takes it in as a string mmhmm when you go like so like when you say like the time is like a is nine and then B is 45 if thinks of it like as like nine in quotation marks and B is fortyfive thinks of it as like a word instead of a number so when you try to go b plus l equals one so you mean that i have to wait so I'm just I'm losing your weight no that's my fault I must have gotten down oh yeah yeah right now for some eat for some for some reason went down to four okay so you're saying that this needs to be a integer so exactly and why not yeah yeah so you just need to convert it so what you can actually do is instead of changing and like it every time PNA is straight off the input on the top you can convert it to an integer there so you can say like a is equal to int input does that make sense oh okay see instead of doing it like in front of every time you use B na you can try yep what we're going out to get rid of those two oh yeah yeah cuz I'm that just saves you from having to type it like every single one but this is just reverse it looks like have several problems okay okay I think I see my pot I'm using too many different types of instant stirs yeah okay so what you could do is a plus oh yeah so you know the plus thing yeah yeah maybe when you're printing it sorry do you mind opening the error message again so I think it just doesn't like that you keep changing it from into string we're just not going to ward the night from error okay yes what that error is saying is like you know how with usually integers you can plus it with other integers so it does like math equations and stuff yes it's getting confused cause you're passing it with a string because generally when you like add strings together they just kind of like mush together and print like that but when you add like a number and a string it gets a bit confused and so what you could do is if we go back to your code but if you want we don't you don't have to worry about this we can just go to the one you're working on oh okay sure but I can help you try fix it if all I'm fired flow for them okay I think there's only a few minutes left of this lesson so I can try help you fix this and then if you want next lesson we can continue up with the time of thing okay is that okay with you yep yep and again just let me know if it's like these are too easy for you the timer one was sort of new but yeah for now I'm just I'm still missing a bit if that's okay you're still missing but yeah that's fine so that's why I like I'm just going through these just so that like you know about them and stuff okay so yeah no I mean like sorry I mean like sorry I mean like I'm throwing this thing like I mean obviously it's not really easy because I've got many mistakes yeah but I mean if it's possible next time could I try to see if I can learn something else okay improving on something I know yeah yeah we can do that so we can if you want like quickly I do that time yeah is that possible yeah yeah so that's actually still with the thymus like that we're learning the full so that's completely fine let me know again like if we want to change back to what we were doing before yeah but also I think the class ends now yes so now it's 645 so sorry to take up your time but yeah next lesson we can work on the other timer and then we will move on to like the next topic switch so I think some of the stuff is new like I was saying like tiles and things so those are in the coming weeks so like there's things like the timer and then like using advance lists and dictionaries but I think you kind of mentioned them if you've done them we can move on to like writing thing to fun like writing Python stuff to files and things like that so we'll just continue like doing new concepts and as I go through these like just let me know if you have done them before or not but yeah we'll start off with the chicken cackling ticking clock sorry next but other than that did you have any questions um not really was everything we did today like okay Oh was it a bit nodes okay yeah I thought from like what you were saying before like next time you draw the line new stuff yeah it's okay yeah that's completely fine but yeah if I were to just quickly do this difficult work yes I think that could so just remember you'd have to change all of them I do see some logic errors in this but I think for now the main thing is just to get the program working yeah okay I can see the logic problem but it's working at least yeah thank you just doing it twice yeah yeah I consider the logic problem but yeah that's good that you saw that but at least you have like you know what the issue was yeah yeah if you didn't have any other questions I might yes a drummer yep next week we'll do the just let me know how the lesson goes as well next week thank have a good night you too
