welcome to coding kids today I will show you how to create the game catch the fruit first let's have a look at what happens in this game when we play it the player controls the bowl by pressing the left and right arrow keys different pieces of fruit glide down the screen automatically meaning they are not controlled by the player the player can move the bowl to catch the fruit if the ball catches a piece of fruit our fruit score increases by one if we drop a piece of fruit the game ends and the backdrop changes to game over if we catch all the fruit the game ends and the backdrop changes you win now let's build this game there are five parts to this game one the bowl the fruit three variables for you win five game over now let's start building one step at a time first let's start with a brand new project by clicking the create button on the home page you will see a new project open with the cat as the default sprite a sprite is a character or object we use in making computer programs for step one we want to add a bowl sprite right click on the cat sprite and press Delete to import a new sprite we can click on the miniature sprite icon and select a sprite from the sprite library I have selected the bowl sprite now we want to add code to our bowl sprite to begin our code we need an events block go to events and select the when green flag clicked block this means we will start our game when the green flag is clicked now place the sprite at the bottom left hand corner of your screen we want to make our bowl move left and right to move our bowl left and right we will use the left and right arrow keys we have already selected the when green flag clicked block for when the movement should start so we shouldn't use the when space key pressed block for the arrow keys instead we you see if there Blagh go to the control tab and drag if dem blocks into the workspace now to make our bowl move left and right go to the sensing tab and select key space pressed add one of these into the top of each if then block to move with the left and right arrow keys we change space to left arrow and right arrow since we're moving left and right this means we are moving along the xaxis so we need the change X by 10 block get 2 of these into the workspace and add to your East M blocks remember to change 10 to negative 10 for left finally we need to add a forever loop find this in the control tab this means the computer will continue checking this condition now let's try it it works so step 2 we want to add fruit sprites to our game click on the minitor sprite icon again to import some new sprites I'm going to choose 4 fruits I have chosen an apple a banana an orange and a watermelon sprite but you can choose any type of sprite you like now let's add code to our sprites I will begin with the Apple sprite first we need an events block so go to events and select the when green flag clicked block for this game we want to make our apple sprite begin in the same position at the start of each game we can do this with the go to block in the motion category move your sprite to the position you wish it to start at at the top of the screen the go to block records this position now you can drag the go to block into your workspace and add it to your code when we start the game we want our Apple to be hidden before showing this gives the player time to prepare we can do this using the hide and show blocks you can find these in the looks tab drag them into your workspace placing the hide block first to make the Apple stay hidden before showing use the weight once xblock find this in the looks category and added to your hide now we want to add motion to our Apple so it falls found the screen however we don't just want our Apple to move downwards we want it to zigzag as it falls to zigzag on the way down we need to move to one side move down move to the other side and move down again we can do this using the change way by 1000 and change X by 10 blocks in the motion category drag two of each of these blocks into your workspace we want to place them X Y X Y for the Y blocks change it to 10 to minus 10 so it will move downwards I want my Apple to move more slowly so I will change the minus 10 to minus 5 to make the Apple move lesson right change the 10 in the X blocks to 5 and minus 5 for movement right and left to make these motions slower we can use the weight once X block find this block in the control category and a bit too each change Y block we don't want it to be too slow so change once X to 0.16 finally we need a forever loop so these conditions are constantly checked find this in the control tab and place it around your change X by and change Y by blocks let's try it now it works we need to code the other sprites now we can do this quickly by dragging this block of code onto each of the fruit sprites we just need to change the position and timing of the fruits select another fruit sprite the first thing we want to do is to choose a position drag the fruit to the position you want it to start at if you look to the top right hand corner of your workspace you will be able to see a value for X and a value for y these are the x and y coordinates of the Speight now type these values into your goto block for the new position we also need to change the weight once xblock for this game we want each fruit to fall at different times this makes it easier for the player to win we can do this by changing one sex I will change it to for sex for this fruit but you can change it to any time you like repeat these steps for the last two fruit sprites we need all the positions and wait times to be unique let's try it again yay all our fruit sprites are falling at different times so steps 4 & 5 we want to introduce the idea of winning and losing so for step 3 we need to add a variable which tells the computer when we win or lose first we will add code to our apple sprite to begin a new block of code we need an events blog drag when green flag clicked into your workspace if the bowl catches all the fruit you win the game so we need to count how much fruit has been caught to do this we can use a variable go to the data tab and make a new variable let's call this variable fruit because it will tell us the amount of fruit that has been caught so if the bowl catches one fruit sprite then this fruit variable should change by one that is if the fruit is touching the bowl the variable increases by one so we need an if/then block from the control tab drag this into your workspace now go to the sensing category and select touching mouse pointer place this in the top of your if phem block change mouse pointer to bowl once the ball catches the fruit we want the fruit to hide so drag the hide block from the looks category into your if vem blog now if the Apple is touching the bowl the Apple hides we also want to count how much fruit has been caught we can do this with the change fruit by one block which is in the data category so when the Apple is caught by the bowl our fruit variable changes by one finally we need a forever loop so this condition is checked continuously drag the forever block from the control category into the workspace and place it around your if vem blog now let's check our code it works notice how if the bowl misses the fruit when the fruit continues to fall along the screen we want the fruit to disappear when it reaches the bottom edge of the screen at the bottom of the screen the ycoordinate is minus 180 we can make a condition that checks if the ycoordinate is equal to minus 180 if so the fruit will hide so again we need them if then block drag this into your workspace and place it below your other sstem blog inside the forever loop to check the ycoordinate we can use the less than sign from the operator category drag the less than sign block into the top of your new is stem block now we need the wide position from the motion category place this on the left side of your less than sign we want to check if y is less than minus 180 the coordinate at the bottom of the screen so type minus 180 into the right side of your less than block now if the y coordinate of the fruit is less than minus 180 the fruit hides drag the hide block from the looks category into your s then blog now let's try it out it works we need to repeat these steps for the rest of the fruit sprites again we can do this quickly by dragging and dropping our code onto each of the other fruit sprites however each time the game begins we want the fruit variable to reset to zero on the bowl sprite we can use the set fruit to zero block from the data category place this underneath see when green flag clicked block but outside of the forever loop a quick test shows that our score resets for steps four and five we want to add you win and game over to our game so first we need a new backdrop select the miniature paintbrush icon at the bottom left hand corner of your screen use the text tool to type the phrase you win onto your new white backdrop and title this backdrop you win you can choose any font color or text size you like for this we can do the same for game over now use the text tool to type game over onto your backdrop and title the backdrop game over so step four we want to add code to our you win backdrop in the backdrops tab make sure you have the you win backdrop selected then click on the scripts tab we will begin our code with the when green flag clicked block from the events tab when we start the backdrop needs to reset to the plain white backdrop so we can use the switch backdrop to you win blog from the looks category change you win to backdrop one and add it under when green flag clicked now we need to add the condition for the you win backdrop if we catch all of the four pieces of fruit then we win the game so we need an ace stem blog drag this blog into your workspace now we can use a variable fruit if a variable fruit equals full then we win so drag the equal sign from the operators category into the top of your if then vlog now select the variable fruit and place it on the left side of the equal sign type for on the other side for step size we need to add code to our first piece of fruit the Apple sprite select the Apple and make sure the scripts tab is open we lose the game when we catch less than four pieces of fruit so we need to make a condition which checks this let's use the timer if I start the game and watch all the fruit fall the game ends after about 18 seconds so if the timer is greater than 18 seconds and the fruit variable is less than 4 we lose now let's add this code so we need an s vem block from the control tab drag this into your workspace we have two conditions for this code so we need the and block from the operators tab now we need a less than sign and a greater than sign drag one of each into either side of your and block you can find the timer block in the sensing category place this on the left side of your greater than block and type 18 on the other side for the other side we need the fruit variable from the data category place this on the left of your left and block and type full in the other side now if this occurs we want our backdrop to change to game over so select the switch backdrop block from the looks category and add it to your code make sure the game over backdrop is selected we also need the stop or block because if we lose we want the game to stop you can find this in the control section add this to the bottom of your code finally drag this block of code into the forever loop that changes the variable fruit now let's try it it works enjoy playing your catch the fruit game
