00:00 - a coders how's it going Chris here and
00:04 - today we're going to do a little bit of
00:06 - styling for our Star Wars soundboard app
00:09 - and because I pretty much suck as a
00:10 - designer I'm gonna keep things pretty
00:12 - basic here so what I have is a star
00:16 - background like this and I just found
00:19 - this through Google Image Search I don't
00:21 - want to use any Star Wars characters in
00:23 - my background because I didn't want to
00:25 - run into any trademark or copyright
00:26 - issues but for my demo I'm sure it would
00:30 - have been okay but just be careful if
00:32 - you're publishing stuff so here I also
00:35 - have a Star Wars logo and I found this
00:37 - on Wikipedia Commons and I found this
00:40 - little note down here says that this
00:43 - image does not meet the threshold of
00:45 - originality needed for copyright
00:47 - protection and therefore is in public
00:49 - domain
00:49 - I don't know how correct this is but
00:52 - this is the logo that I plan to use in
00:54 - my application I also have a Star Wars
00:58 - font and there are actually four of them
01:01 - in here and I found this through this
01:03 - site diff'ent and it's 100% free to use
01:07 - so I'm going to be changing the button
01:09 - text to use this sort of Star Wars
01:11 - themed typography now if you guys
01:14 - complete this soundboard app and then
01:15 - you guys style it a different way I
01:17 - definitely want you to show me and if
01:19 - you do I'll share it with everyone else
01:21 - okay so let's go ahead and prepare our
01:24 - assets here I've got the two images
01:26 - downloaded you'll notice that I put at
01:28 - 3x because this is intended to be the
01:30 - largest size for the iPhone six-plus you
01:33 - want to make sure you have a nice
01:35 - healthy resolution for your images as a
01:39 - 3x so you can see here for this
01:42 - background it's huge
01:44 - alright so you want to make sure you
01:46 - have some large assets to work with and
01:49 - you're going to add the 3x suffix to
01:52 - your file name and then you're going to
01:54 - go over here to this app called prep oh
01:57 - you can download it for free from the
01:58 - Mac App Store and when you open it it
02:00 - looks like this I'm gonna go to artwork
02:02 - I'm just gonna drag both of these into
02:05 - here and then I'm gonna click export and
02:09 - just save it right there so that's going
02:12 - to create my
02:13 - two X versions and the One X versions
02:16 - right now I can close prep oh now I'm
02:19 - going to open up the Xcode project which
02:21 - we were working on we're going to go
02:25 - into the assets library and then we're
02:28 - going to highlight all of these images
02:30 - and then we're just going to drag it
02:32 - into there and it's gonna be smart
02:34 - enough to group them together into two
02:36 - image assets SW logo and SW stars so
02:40 - let's start off by going into the main
02:42 - dot storyboard and adding two image
02:45 - views one for the background and one for
02:48 - the logo so because my screen is a
02:49 - little small right now I'm just going to
02:51 - make sure I have my document outline
02:53 - open down to the view here and I'm gonna
02:56 - search for image and it's gonna show up
02:59 - the image view in the object library
03:01 - then I'm gonna click and I'm gonna drag
03:03 - this and move it into my document
03:05 - outline now I don't want to put it into
03:07 - the stack view I want to put it above
03:09 - the stack view into my view
03:11 - so I've right now I've accidentally
03:13 - replaced my view that's really bad press
03:16 - command said just undo that and try it
03:18 - again so sometimes if you have to just
03:21 - put it inside your stack view or below
03:24 - it just do that first and then you can
03:26 - move it so you want it right there in
03:29 - between the view and the stack view
03:32 - because you want the stack view to sit
03:33 - on top of the image view alright so I'm
03:35 - just gonna label this background so that
03:38 - we know and then I'm going to add some
03:40 - constraints to anchor to all four edges
03:43 - so I'm going to uncheck constrain the
03:45 - margins I'm just gonna go 0 it's gonna
03:48 - turn on all 4 constraints when you edit
03:50 - the values in there and you just want to
03:52 - make sure that the nearest neighbor
03:54 - click this little arrow to pull the drop
03:56 - down that it's relative to the view okay
03:59 - and then it might change the number back
04:01 - on you so press 0 again so check the top
04:03 - in the bottom make sure that the nearest
04:05 - neighbor is view and not the layout
04:07 - guide okay so when you add these 4
04:10 - constraints and then you go update
04:13 - frames it's gonna stretch the image view
04:15 - to all four sides like that and if that
04:19 - doesn't work out for you just go under
04:21 - here and delete the constraints that
04:23 - relate to the image view and try it
04:25 - again
04:25 - so for the background I'm going to
04:27 - choose SW stars and as you can see
04:30 - instantly we see all these stars I'm
04:33 - gonna change it to a SPECT fill so it
04:36 - doesn't stretch out the background image
04:38 - the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
04:40 - gonna add another image view here and
04:42 - this is going to be the Star Wars logo
04:44 - so I'm just going to rename this quickly
04:47 - and I also want this to sit behind the
04:51 - stock view because I don't want it to
04:53 - block the buttons next what I'm going to
04:55 - do is add some constraints I want to add
04:57 - a constraint against the top and I want
05:00 - to add a constraint against the stack
05:02 - view right here so that's never going to
05:04 - overlap the stack view so make sure that
05:06 - the logo is selected go down here let's
05:10 - uncheck constrain to margins I'm going
05:12 - to click this arrow make sure it's
05:14 - against the view so 15 is alright just
05:17 - turn on the bottom margin and check that
05:19 - the nearest neighbor is the stack
05:21 - viewing I'm gonna also change this to 15
05:23 - so now let's add two constraints we also
05:26 - want to horizontally Center it so let's
05:28 - do that and then finally we can choose
05:31 - the image SW logo and I'm gonna choose
05:35 - aspect to fit like that and it's gonna
05:39 - keep it nice and tidy in there so update
05:44 - frames okay so now let's run it so we
05:46 - can see the logo and the background and
05:50 - there we go
05:51 - so now let's change the font so that it
05:54 - looks a little more Star Wars II and the
05:57 - fact that I'm going to use out of these
05:59 - four is probably this one right here
06:01 - star Jedi TTF and if we look in the
06:06 - folder with the fonts that's this first
06:09 - folder right here so I probably need
06:11 - this one so I'm going to drag this star
06:14 - Jedi dot TTFN into the Xcode project but
06:17 - I'm gonna create a folder for group
06:19 - sorry for fonts first and then let's go
06:23 - ahead and add this into the fonts folder
06:25 - so I'm gonna copy items if needed so
06:28 - it's gonna include it in my project
06:29 - folder and make sure that this add two
06:31 - targets is checked it might not be
06:33 - checked by default so let's click finish
06:36 - by checking that it includes it in our
06:38 - app bundle okay
06:40 - so the next thing we have to do now is
06:41 - go into our info.plist and we have to
06:44 - add a key so click this plus icon and
06:47 - type in fonts or capital F fonts
06:52 - provided by application now the next
06:54 - step is to expand this and it should by
06:58 - default have an item 0 we just want to
07:00 - double click here in the value column
07:02 - and we're gonna add our font file name
07:05 - so make sure that you spell it exactly
07:09 - as the file name is with the proper
07:11 - capitalization and everything because
07:14 - it's actually pretty finicky so finicky
07:16 - in fact that I wrote a whole post about
07:19 - it on my site code with Chris comm
07:21 - called common mistakes with adding
07:23 - custom fonts to your iOS app and we've
07:25 - done probably steps 1 to 4 at this point
07:28 - okay so going back to it we're gonna
07:31 - press command B to build the project and
07:34 - usually I customize the font I change
07:37 - the font on labels using code but here
07:40 - we're gonna try to do it in the
07:41 - storyboard so hopefully just by adding
07:44 - the font to our in philippi list we can
07:47 - use it here when we want to customize
07:49 - the button text so I'm gonna select my
07:51 - lightsaber button and over here on the
07:54 - font section in the inspector I'm gonna
07:56 - click this icon change it to custom and
07:59 - under family look for star Jedi which is
08:03 - right here so that's great that's
08:06 - awesome and next I'm going to probably
08:09 - change the color to maybe a yellow or
08:13 - something like that or maybe white
08:16 - because the logo is yellow so you can
08:19 - see how my designer mind works or lack
08:23 - thereof so I'm gonna go with white and
08:25 - actually I'm just going to select
08:27 - blaster fire and hold down command and
08:29 - select the other two buttons so I'm
08:30 - gonna modify all three at once
08:32 - click the icon the font button choose
08:36 - custom for family go down to star Jedi
08:40 - and then I'm gonna change the text to
08:45 - white now it looks like I need to update
08:47 - frames because one of them is getting a
08:49 - little cut off I'm gonna select the
08:51 - stack view
08:52 - go down here say update frames okay
08:55 - still looks cutoff but I don't think it
08:57 - will be if we run it I think this is
09:00 - only because yeah see it's getting cut
09:03 - off here because I think this image or
09:06 - you know why I'm not sure why but it
09:08 - looks fine in our simulator so there's
09:17 - our styled Star Wars soundboard app
09:20 - don't forget that you can customize this
09:22 - to any sort of theme that you want and
09:23 - put in your own sounds now my
09:26 - customizations were pretty basic so if
09:28 - you build this demo and you theme it or
09:31 - you customize it for yourself let me
09:33 - know and if I get enough submissions
09:35 - I'll create a separate video showing all
09:37 - your creations and if I don't get enough
09:39 - submissions I'll still share your app on
09:42 - my social accounts so that everyone can
09:45 - see what an awesome job you did anyways
09:47 - thank you for watching and if you
09:49 - enjoyed this series please subscribe
09:50 - please like the video and please share
09:53 - them with any Star Wars fans that you
09:55 - know of so thank you once again and I'll
09:57 - see you guys tomorrow take it easy

a coders how's it going Chris here and today we're going to do a little bit of styling for our Star Wars soundboard app and because I pretty much suck as a designer I'm gonna keep things pretty basic

want you to show me and if you do I'll share it with everyone else okay so let's go ahead and prepare our assets here I've got the two images downloaded you'll notice that I put at 3x because this is
