00:00 - hey it's Chris here in this video I want
00:02 - to take a couple of minutes to explain
00:03 - why I prefer to use figma over sketch
00:06 - full transparency I own both and in fact
00:09 - I almost exclusively used sketch before
00:11 - and then I've moved over to using figma
00:14 - now the biggest reason about why that
00:17 - transition happened is because of
00:19 - platform support you see the code with
00:21 - Chris team started to grow and not
00:24 - everyone was using a Mac and I didn't
00:26 - want to kind of fragment our team you
00:30 - know some people using sketch and then
00:32 - other people using figma so I decided
00:34 - that everyone uses figma and for the
00:38 - extent that we use it feature wise
00:41 - they're both the same now I know some of
00:43 - you guys who use these tools day in and
00:45 - day out professionally are going to not
00:49 - like that statement because you guys
00:51 - will definitely know the details about
00:53 - what makes those two programs different
00:55 - but for the extent that we use it for
00:58 - designing apps doing app graphics social
01:02 - media graphics youtube thumbnails and
01:04 - stuff like that
01:05 - they both are perfectly fine now talking
01:09 - about platform support on figma for a
01:11 - moment they have desktop apps for PC and
01:15 - Mac but actually I find that we end up
01:18 - using figma in the browser like 99% of
01:21 - the time for me I love it because it's
01:24 - fast it's easy and I never have to do
01:27 - software updates so I usually have a
01:30 - Chrome browser window open already and
01:32 - it's just another tab so it's really
01:34 - awesome the other thing is the price
01:37 - point now sketch is not expensive not by
01:40 - far in fact it's a really good deal for
01:42 - what you get for the price that you pay
01:44 - however figma has a free tier which
01:48 - worked perfectly for my team and I
01:51 - haven't had to pay for using figma for a
01:53 - number of years and I'm still not paying
01:55 - for it
01:56 - now the free tier allows you to have
02:00 - three projects per team I believe and up
02:04 - to two collaborators per project if you
02:08 - don't need more than two people working
02:10 - on the same document then you're not
02:12 - really going to have
02:13 - and in terms of the three project limit
02:16 - I haven't really experienced the problem
02:18 - with that because you can always create
02:20 - another team and get another three
02:22 - projects under the same login and
02:24 - account so when you log into your figma
02:26 - account you're just gonna have multiple
02:29 - teams and each team can have up to three
02:30 - projects but within each project you can
02:33 - have as many documents as you want right
02:36 - and each document has pages and
02:38 - artboards per page so there's a there's
02:42 - a lot of ways to organize what you're
02:45 - doing so that you don't hit these limits
02:47 - now only time I I think that you're
02:49 - really going to hit a hard limit where
02:51 - you're gonna have to start paying is if
02:53 - you want more than two people to be
02:55 - collaborating on the same document now
02:57 - in terms of collaboration figma has also
02:59 - been great I can't really speak to
03:02 - collaboration and sharing with sketch
03:04 - because when I was using sketch
03:05 - exclusively it was just me as a solo
03:07 - developer for all I know sketch probably
03:10 - has the same capabilities but for figma
03:13 - collaborating has been really great
03:15 - because for each figma document you can
03:18 - just create a link to that document and
03:20 - I can post that link with the task and
03:23 - the task board that my team uses to kind
03:27 - of get organized and and manage and see
03:29 - what everyone's doing I can just post a
03:31 - link to the figma file and when they
03:34 - click that link it just launches it in
03:35 - the browser and then they can look at it
03:37 - they can export the graphics they need
03:38 - or they can update it or whatnot so
03:41 - we're not passing files around and also
03:44 - the fact that we've been managing with
03:46 - just the free tier in figma has really
03:49 - saved me that sketch licensing cost I
03:51 - mean for one person it's not very
03:54 - expensive but you know for a team of
03:56 - five to six then that starts to add up
03:58 - and that money could be used for other
04:00 - purposes and the last reason I prefer
04:05 - figma over sketch is just due to the
04:08 - nature of the work that we do we produce
04:10 - tutorials for our app development and a
04:13 - lot of beginners they're just dabbling
04:16 - right they don't know if app development
04:18 - is for them yet they're not very serious
04:20 - about it and to have to pay for a
04:24 - license fee to use to be able to produce
04:26 - ground
04:27 - fix for your app is a barrier to entry
04:29 - right whereas I could tell people and
04:32 - recommend to use figma you can create a
04:34 - free account you can dabble around it
04:36 - you can practice and then you can
04:38 - actually create your graphics and export
04:40 - it you can use it all for free that
04:42 - definitely helps in terms of getting
04:45 - people into app development and building
04:47 - their own apps now as a professional if
04:50 - you're using these tools day in and day
04:52 - out obviously you probably will have a
04:55 - different opinion about it and in terms
04:58 - of support from other graphics tools and
05:01 - other graphics you know services or
05:03 - platforms Sketch might be more well
05:06 - supported maybe even in terms of the
05:08 - plugins that are available for sketch
05:10 - versus figma sketch might have a bigger
05:13 - library of plugins so you know all of
05:15 - those things definitely play a factor
05:18 - into your decision whether to use sketch
05:20 - or figma but at the end of the day you
05:22 - have to see what purpose you need it for
05:26 - and consider all of the factors for that
05:28 - so those are my personal reasons about
05:30 - why our team is using figma / sketch I'm
05:34 - interested in what you guys use and what
05:36 - you think let me know in the comments
05:38 - below whether you sketch or figma and
05:40 - tell me why alright thanks for watching
05:42 - I'll see you guys in the next video
