00:08 - hey guys welcome to lesson five of learn
00:10 - Objective C and today we are going to be
00:13 - talking about memory
00:15 - management okay so in this video we're
00:17 - talking about memory management so for
00:19 - this xcode project you can download it
00:21 - in the link below in the description or
00:23 - you can click on The annotation on the
00:25 - screen to download it and this project I
00:29 - have created a custom class called my
00:32 - class and what we're going to be doing
00:35 - is creating an instance of it in
00:38 - viewcontroller.m and then I'll show you
00:40 - guys some memory management details so
00:44 - start by importing my
00:49 - class and then in here I'm going to
00:52 - create an instance of it
01:04 - so we've done this a couple of times in
01:06 - previous videos but what we didn't
01:09 - really talk about is memory management
01:12 - so in Objective C there is no garbage
01:15 - collector if you're familiar from other
01:18 - uh languages like C and stuff like that
01:21 - so what is happening right here is we're
01:23 - actually allocating space in memory for
01:26 - this instance of my class as a developer
01:30 - in Objective C we are responsible for
01:33 - indicating when objects are in use when
01:36 - they they're still needed or when they
01:38 - they're not needed and they're ready to
01:40 - be deallocated and you know have that
01:42 - memory freed up so there's a system in
01:46 - Objective C for indicating that and it's
01:49 - called a retain counter so each instance
01:52 - of an object has uh something called a
01:56 - retain counter and it's a simple um it's
01:59 - just the number basically for in
02:02 - instance in this object my class
02:05 - instance we just allocated an in
02:08 - initialized it the retain counter for
02:10 - this guy is one and that indicates that
02:14 - it's still in use anything above one
02:16 - means it's in use so what's important to
02:18 - note is that after iOS 5 there's
02:22 - something called Arc or automatic
02:24 - reference counting and that kind of
02:26 - takes care of this memory management
02:29 - stuff for you
02:30 - but behind the scenes this is still
02:33 - happening and it's important to
02:35 - understand it so that's why I'm still
02:37 - explaining it um pre iOS 5 what would
02:40 - you'd have to do in this case is you'd
02:43 - actually have to release it so if I
02:45 - allocate this um instance of this object
02:48 - and I'm doing something with it in my
02:50 - method at the end of the me uh the
02:52 - method I'd actually have to go call
02:55 - release on it and what that does is it
02:57 - decrements the retain counter of that
02:59 - object by one which would bring it to
03:01 - zero and what happens when the retain
03:04 - counter for the instance of this object
03:06 - reaches zero is a special method gets
03:10 - called on that object called
03:12 - dioc and then the memory gets freed up
03:15 - and it's returned to the system so in my
03:18 - class you won't see a dioc method here
03:22 - it's actually you know a method at NS
03:24 - object but you what you do is you
03:26 - override it
03:35 - so what we're doing here is overriding
03:37 - the dioc method when the retain counter
03:40 - for that instance reaches zero this
03:42 - method dioc automatically gets called we
03:45 - never call it manually so super is
03:49 - referring to the parent class of um of
03:52 - my class so we're calling our parents
03:56 - dioc method but in here you know can
04:00 - have any sort of custom code to release
04:05 - other objects that this instance may
04:07 - have created so if in using my class you
04:11 - know I've created a whole bunch of other
04:13 - objects and allocated an initialize
04:16 - other things in my dioc method I would
04:18 - want to clean up all of that stuff and
04:21 - if we don't do that properly then our
04:23 - app is going to have memory leaks and
04:25 - possibly lead to app
04:26 - crashes going back to view controller
04:31 - uh if we manually wanted to increment
04:34 - the uh retain counter on an
04:37 - instance we would use the retain so this
04:41 - alloc in nit Paradigm will
04:44 - automatically uh incremented by one
04:47 - that's why even without this retain uh
04:50 - my class instance would have a retain
04:52 - counter of one and then me calling
04:54 - release at the end of it would bring it
04:56 - down to zero so let's give you some
04:58 - examples of things that can go wrong in
05:00 - managing your own
05:02 - memory so for example if I were to call
05:05 - release
05:06 - on this reference variable
05:09 - here what would happen is it would bring
05:12 - the retain counter for my class instance
05:14 - down to zero and then diock would get
05:17 - called on that instance and that memory
05:20 - that that object was taken up would get
05:23 - released so if I try
05:26 - to uh access that instance of the object
05:29 - object here by let's say calling a
05:31 - method of it or trying to do something
05:32 - with it your app would
05:35 - crash now for example here's let me give
05:38 - you another example if I have another
05:41 - variable
05:43 - uh call it second reference
05:48 - and I point it to my class
05:52 - instance if I release it here keep in
05:56 - mind that the retain count is still one
06:00 - and then when I release it here the
06:02 - retain count of my class instance would
06:06 - be zero and then if I Tred to do
06:09 - something with second reference like
06:11 - call a method of it or something like
06:13 - that it would be pointing
06:15 - to you know something that doesn't exist
06:17 - anymore now what I'd actually have to do
06:23 - is assign it that so I'm incrementing by
06:28 - calling retain I'm increment ing the
06:29 - retain counter on that instance so now
06:33 - it sits at two and when I call release
06:36 - on it I'm decrementing it back to one
06:40 - and then uh I would be able to use
06:44 - second reference and call a method or do
06:46 - whatever with it and then at the end of
06:49 - the method I would have to call release
06:53 - on it to decrement it down to zero so
06:56 - that it gets cleaned up if I don't have
06:58 - this statement here and I would have a
07:00 - memory
07:02 - leak so now you guys know how Objective
07:05 - C handles memory management so with the
07:08 - introduction of iOS 5 and automa
07:11 - reference counting otherwise known as
07:13 - Arc you don't have to write those retain
07:15 - and release statements anymore so we're
07:17 - going to talk about that in the next
07:20 - episode now for your fact of the day did
07:22 - you know that the first iPhone was
07:25 - launched on June 29th of 2007 that's
07:30 - about five years ago six years ago
07:33 - actually and they've come up with well
07:37 - iPhone 2 iPhone 3 3GS 4 4s 5 that's six
07:43 - iphon that's once once a year so do you
07:46 - guys have any thoughts and comments on
07:48 - that let me know in the comment section
07:50 - below and I'll talk to you guys next
07:51 - time

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to lesson five of learn Objective C and today we are going to be talking about memory management okay so in this video we're talking about memory management so for this xcode project you can download it in the link below in the description or you can click on The annotation on the screen to download it and this project I have created a custom class called my class and what we're

a system in Objective C for indicating that and it's called a retain counter so each instance of an object has uh something called a retain counter and it's a simple um it's just the number basically for in instance in this object my class instance we just allocated an in initialized it the retain counter for this guy is one and that indicates that it's still in use anything above one means it's

scenes this is still happening and it's important to understand it so that's why I'm still explaining it um pre iOS 5 what would you'd have to do in this case is you'd actually have to release it so if I allocate this um instance of this object and I'm doing something with it in my method at the end of the me uh the method I'd actually have to go call release on it and what that does is it decrements the retain counter of that object by one which would bring it to zero and what happens when the retain counter for the instance of this object reaches zero is a special method gets called on that object called dioc and then the memory gets freed up and it's returned to the system so in my class you won't see a dioc method here it's actually you know a method at NS object but you what
