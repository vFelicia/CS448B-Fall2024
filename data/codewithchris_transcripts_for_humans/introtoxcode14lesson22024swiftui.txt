With timestamps:

00:00 - in the last lesson you use the xcode to build 
this now in this xcode tutorial I want to take  
00:05 - a little more time and show you around so that 
you can understand what you did and begin to  
00:09 - master this tool now you're going to want to pay 
close attention because over the course of your  
00:14 - journey you're going to be spending a lot of time 
inside xcode turning your app ideas into reality  
00:19 - oh and at the end of the video I'll be sharing my 
xcode tips and tricks with you that I use every  
00:23 - day so make sure you watch till the end okay quick 
note before we begin back in lesson one I showed  
00:28 - you how to download and install xcode so if you 
haven't done that yet go ahead and do that first  
00:32 - once you have xcode launched let's get into it all 
right let's create our new project click create a  
00:38 - New Mexico project right here or go to file new 
and project now there are several options here  
00:44 - actually they're templates and you can create 
apps for different platforms Mac OS watch OS  
00:49 - TV OS for cars even multi-platform if you want to 
launch your app on multiple platforms however we  
00:56 - are going to choose IOS app and actually look 
there's game AR apps there's iMessage sticker  
01:02 - packs a ton of stuff we're going to stick with the 
basics for now this is a good starting Place let's  
01:06 - click next and here let me explain some of these 
options for you so they don't look so cryptic  
01:11 - first of all product name is easy right we're 
just going to put whatever we want to name this  
01:17 - app now team is something that I want to explain 
remember packing less one when we talked about  
01:21 - the process to launch your app into the story well 
the code from xcode that gets turned into a code  
01:26 - package and then you have to code sign it as in 
put your digital signature on it so that people  
01:31 - can't impersonate you and then that's the thing 
that gets put into the App Store well this here  
01:37 - is how you're going to code sign it and to get 
a team on the drop down here you actually have  
01:44 - to sign up for the Apple developer program which 
is that yearly paid program to allow you to submit  
01:50 - apps it will give you access to a portal where you 
can upload your digital signature and that's how  
01:56 - you're going to be able to create a team in here 
but for the purpose of these demos we can leave  
02:02 - it as none now what's more important though 
is this bundle identifier because this is the  
02:07 - unique ID for your app and this has to be unique 
for all apps on the App Store It's a combination  
02:12 - of your product name as you can see as well as 
your organization identifier and here you can  
02:16 - put anything typically people do com dot your 
company name or your personal name and together  
02:22 - that is your bundle identifier now the next two 
pieces interface and language I want to draw your  
02:28 - attention back to that diagram in lesson one where 
we said Swift UI is how you're going to build your  
02:33 - user interfaces Swift is the coding language 
you're going to use to express your logic and  
02:37 - together you're going to use those two tools to 
build your app and that's essentially what these  
02:42 - two things are there are some options however in 
particular for interface if you pull this down  
02:47 - you can select storyboard or Swift UI Swift UI is 
definitely a lot easier to learn and it is the UI  
02:53 - framework moving forward because Swift UI is sort 
of the replacement for storyboards um right now  
03:01 - as of today there are still companies out there 
using storyboards but Apple's full intention is  
03:06 - to discontinue that and move forward with swift 
UI so I would definitely recommend learning Swift  
03:11 - UI and if you do choose Swift UI you have to 
choose Swift if you choose storyboard you can  
03:16 - still learn Objective C but again I wouldn't start 
with Objective C unless you had a very very good  
03:21 - reason specifically to do so maybe you are trying 
to Target a job that only uses Objective C and  
03:28 - that's what you would pick but Swift UI and Swift 
is where we want to be now these two options here  
03:34 - core data and include tests these are options 
that you can always add to your app after the  
03:39 - fact so you don't feel pressured that you have to 
check them here but even for the purposes of what  
03:45 - we're learning these are unnecessary so core data 
is a way to have a local database on your device  
03:52 - and tests is used in software development where 
your project gets really big and you need to write  
03:59 - automated test cases because once your software 
gets really large if you make a change it's not  
04:06 - feasible for you to manually test all the features 
all over again for every single change that you  
04:12 - make so you need to include automated testing that 
you can just click a button and run and it'll say  
04:17 - pass fail pass fail and you can see what breaks 
after you make a change so again not for us leave  
04:22 - these unchecked let's go ahead and click next and 
now now you can choose a place to save it I would  
04:27 - recommend if you are taking this seriously and 
you are going to continue on learning create a  
04:32 - space in your hard drive a folder perhaps for all 
of your apps and projects so that they can stay  
04:38 - organized for myself I'll admit I'm a bit of a 
messy person and this is a demo so I'm just going  
04:44 - to create out my desktop Source control now this 
if you don't know what this is it's kind of like  
04:49 - versioning so imagine being able to take snapshots 
of your project and code so that later on if  
04:55 - you accidentally break your project and it's not 
working anymore you can always roll back to one of  
05:00 - your snapshots this is kind of like time machine 
on the Mac if you've ever used that so definitely  
05:06 - a very good practice in software development 
in fact kind of mandatory if you're working  
05:12 - professionally for us right now we are going to 
leave this unchecked because I will introduce this  
05:18 - to you later on okay let's go ahead and create 
it and let's check out our brand new project  
05:24 - so here's our branding project before we dive into 
each of these files and I tell you what they're  
05:30 - for let us talk about the major big areas of xcode 
so you can get acquainted so there are five main  
05:37 - areas of xcode firstly on the left hand side 
here you have your Navigator area in the middle  
05:42 - the biggest area you have your editor area on the 
right hand side this is known as the inspectors or  
05:49 - utility area across the top at the top here you 
have your toolbar area and at the bottom tucked  
05:55 - away is this debug area which you really only need 
when you start working with code so we're going  
06:02 - to hide that again so those are the five major 
areas of xcode let's dive into each one and I'll  
06:08 - show you in the context of your project what these 
areas are for let's start with the file Navigator  
06:14 - so here you have your xcode project and all of 
the files in your project so you can see these  
06:20 - are collapsible folders these are the files these 
are the asset libraries that you learned about in  
06:26 - lesson one but notice across the top here there 
are tabs to The Navigators this first tab is the  
06:33 - file Navigator or project Navigator but there are 
different types of Navigator so you will encounter  
06:40 - these when we get Farther Along right now there's 
not too much to see I would leave it on this first  
06:46 - tab under a file Navigator project Navigator so 
you can take a look at all of your files next  
06:53 - let's move on to the editor area the biggest area 
this is where you're going to be spending most of  
06:57 - your time editing your files notice that this area 
changes depending on what you're looking at this  
07:03 - file is a pure code file so it's all code this one 
is a view so you're going to get half code you're  
07:09 - going to get the preview and asset Library again 
it changes so the editor area is very versatile  
07:15 - it changes depending on what file you want to edit 
now inside the editor area there's also a lot of  
07:21 - cool little tucked away things to make editing 
easier such as across the top here you can have  
07:28 - tabs there's breadcrumb you can even jump within 
the file and you can open up you can split up this  
07:35 - editor area into multiple panes window panes as 
well which I'll show you closer to the end of  
07:41 - this lesson for now let's move on to the right 
most side this is the inspector area sometimes  
07:47 - people call it the utility area which will work as 
well however what this is for is it allows you to  
07:56 - configure whatever you are working on or looking 
at inside the editor area so for example if we  
08:05 - um you know you've seen this if I put my cursor 
on one of the view elements here I would be able  
08:12 - to configure it right if I put my cursor on this 
thing called view there's nothing I can configure  
08:19 - with this keyword view however if I click across 
the tabs here there is a quick help tab now this  
08:27 - is useful because it tells me what this view 
keyword means and what it does here this tab  
08:34 - is the identity tab it tells me where this file 
exists where this content view exists on my hard  
08:41 - drive right and what app membership does it 
belong to and things like that so that's what  
08:47 - the inspector area is good for now I don't know 
if you've noticed but there is a cascading effect  
08:52 - going on right if I select this it changes this if 
I select something in the editor area it changes  
09:00 - what happens in the inspectors area so think left 
to right waterfall next up let's look at the top  
09:07 - toolbar now first of all this leftmost button 
hides your Navigators if you need more space on  
09:14 - your laptop maybe your screen is kind of small 
you can make more space on the right hand side  
09:18 - there's a similar button to hide the inspectors 
area so now you get a full editor area for editing  
09:26 - there is this run button to run your app inside a 
simulator like we did in lesson one and here you  
09:35 - can click on the simulator select a different one 
you can test your app on all sorts of different  
09:40 - simulators also if you plug in your device into 
your computer you are going to see that device  
09:49 - here and you can choose it and you can actually 
launch your app on that device so that's something  
09:53 - we're going to do in this video series so don't 
worry about that we'll get to that there when  
09:59 - you first plug in your phone you're going to get 
a pop-up on your phone saying do you trust this  
10:03 - computer you're going to have to say trust before 
you can actually see it on this menu just in case  
10:08 - you're doing it right now here it tells you what's 
happening behind the scenes sometimes you know if  
10:15 - you're saying thinking xcode is slow it might be 
because it's doing something behind the scenes  
10:19 - and this is the status bar that tells you what's 
going on now this exclude cloud is something that  
10:25 - you don't have to worry about yet but it's a it's 
a way for you to be able to run your projects and  
10:31 - test you know run those test cases that I told 
you about when we created the project it's a way  
10:36 - to run those test cases on the cloud on Apple's 
servers the reason is because sometimes these take  
10:43 - quite a while to run and also um you might want 
to run those tests on multiple different devices  
10:52 - and so you can deploy those things to the cloud 
and run them there this icon we've used before  
10:59 - it's the library right so if we go back to the 
content View and you click this plus icon there's  
11:03 - our library that's so useful and then yep we 
talked about this icon so that's the toolbar  
11:10 - now that you know your way around xcode let's 
take a look at your project files so let's start  
11:15 - at the very root of your xcode project which is 
inside your file Navigator this node right here  
11:21 - now this is where you can configure different 
things for your project these are things like  
11:28 - what is the version number what is the display 
name should it be able to display in various  
11:33 - orientations and all the things like that actually 
this is probably pretty important what iOS version  
11:39 - should it be able to install on you might set 
16 and nothing lower than that will be able  
11:45 - to install your app and this is for the reason 
that sometimes you're using features which are  
11:50 - only available on let's say iOS 16. uh so that 
is the root project node here is also where  
11:58 - you would configure different things like uh you 
might have to add different capabilities to your  
12:04 - app such as Game Center or being able to do uh 
in-app purchases or notifications or things like  
12:11 - that you have to add different things and just 
in general there's a whole ton of settings this  
12:16 - is your project settings now after that there 
is a folder inside contains a couple more files  
12:23 - you've got this entry point this is where your 
app starts okay this is the first thing that  
12:30 - gets executed before it launches the first screen 
of your app and that is what this is content view  
12:37 - if we click onto the next file that is content 
view you can see here this is what it looks like  
12:44 - and uh the entry point if you click back here 
you can see that it creates a Content view so  
12:49 - that makes sense right this is the entry point 
for your app when the app launches it creates  
12:54 - this screen content view which is what you 
see here and in fact when you launch it in  
12:59 - the simulator this is the first screen that you 
see so hopefully that makes a lot of sense and  
13:04 - next you have your asset Library which stores all 
of your colors your image assets and even this is  
13:11 - where you'd specify your app icon you just place 
an image into here to have that be your app icon  
13:18 - and then inside preview content is another asset 
library but this is just only specifically for the  
13:25 - previews here that you see so if you perhaps you 
know sometimes previewing doesn't make sense if  
13:32 - there's no data to preview right like for example 
if you've got a scrollable list of photos but you  
13:38 - don't have any actual photos there's nothing 
really to see right so this is where you would  
13:43 - put those test or preview assets to be used 
and that in a nutshell are all of your files  
13:50 - in your xcode project next up let's see how we can 
test our app now in terms of testing your app we  
13:56 - mentioned the simulator in lesson one so just as 
a recap you can select a simulator of your choice  
14:01 - here and then you can hit this run button and 
it's going to launch an on-screen virtual device  
14:07 - if this is the first time you're doing it expect 
a couple of minutes for this to boot up but here  
14:12 - this is a great way to test your app you can click 
through all the screens and interact with it you  
14:17 - can simulate different device features such as low 
memory situations or low Network situations to see  
14:23 - how your app would behave and in general just 
test your app this preview here in the editor  
14:28 - area is actually great for seeing how your screen 
looks like as you build it and there are a couple  
14:33 - of tools for that for example there are zooming 
capabilities here you can zoom in zoom out Zoom to  
14:40 - fit and zoom to 100 that's what these different 
buttons do you can also look at variations for  
14:46 - example I can look at what dark mode would look 
like on my phone or I could look at landscape  
14:52 - orientation if this is too tedious you can look 
at multiple variations At Once by clicking this  
14:57 - button right here and for example I can click 
color scheme and that's going to show me light  
15:02 - and dark I can click on orientation for example 
or maybe Dynamic type and see how different font  
15:10 - sizes look on the UI and then finally we have 
these two different modes by default it's on  
15:16 - this live mode which lets you you interact with 
the elements on your preview for example I may  
15:23 - add a button let's open up the library under 
views search for button you'll see it there  
15:30 - and click and drag it you'll see a button you can 
see by default I'm on live mode down here and I  
15:35 - can interact with this there is another Mode 
called selectable mode or select mode and it  
15:41 - allows you just simply to select your elements 
perhaps you want to see the corresponding code  
15:46 - for that element so that's a great way to 
learn another functionality is selecting  
15:50 - an element so that you can configure it in the 
inspector area that's pretty helpful as well  
15:57 - and now I want to leave you with some xcode tips 
that I use every single day inside xcode these  
16:02 - are so useful and it may not be apparent right now 
but as you start well as we start building the app  
16:08 - in this video series you're going to see us using 
these so the first one probably the most basic one  
16:13 - is this one here these go back and go forward 
arrows these work just like your web browser  
16:19 - arrows and sometimes let's say you're moving 
from this file to this file to another file here  
16:25 - and there these buttons just let you jump back to 
the place you were in so when you're working with  
16:31 - code sometimes it the the code file gets really 
long and this breadcrumb right here allows you  
16:39 - to jump between different sections in your file 
which is really handy here you can actually jump  
16:45 - to different files as well clicking the spread 
Chrome right here on the upper right hand corner  
16:53 - here there are a few useful things as well so this 
middle icon allows you to customize how the editor  
17:00 - looks so if you choose show editor only you're you 
don't need the preview perhaps you can click that  
17:07 - right you can also there's this mini map which is 
quite useful as well which lets you uh scrub your  
17:17 - file so if your file was very very long this would 
be an easy way to just sort of navigate and you  
17:23 - can see at a glance what your file is looking like 
uh if you want to let's say look at two files side  
17:31 - by side you could do that by clicking this upper 
right hand corner button and opening two editors  
17:36 - side by side and obviously the more screen real 
estate that you have the more useful this becomes  
17:43 - um as for now it is probably not very useful for 
me with the size of this xcode window and with  
17:49 - the size of the font that I have right here but 
nonetheless you know that this is available to you  
17:55 - and there are different tabs right here as you can 
see here now as you code more you'll undoubtedly  
18:00 - run into a situation where you're wondering what 
else can the v-stack do or can the v stack do this  
18:05 - or that so I'm happy to say that documentation is 
embedded right into xcode now you can just Google  
18:13 - vstack and find it or there are a couple of fast 
ways to do that with an xcode so one way is go  
18:19 - into Windows developer documentation and you can 
just search up vstack in here I've already found  
18:24 - it but yeah you can do that you can look look at 
what it can do how to use it and things like that  
18:30 - an easier way even faster it's just put putting 
your cursor over it and using the inspector panel  
18:37 - and going over to this quick help section and then 
you can even click on the link here to open it to  
18:42 - that page even faster if you want to hold down 
the option or Alt key on your keyboard hover  
18:49 - over v-stack and you can get a pop-up dialog for 
that again there's a link to open the developer  
18:54 - documentation really handy stuff all right so 
now you know all about the file Navigator the  
19:00 - editor area the inspector area the toolbar and 
the debug area and you know how to start your own  
19:06 - Xcode project and what each of the files in your 
project is for in the next lesson we're going to  
19:10 - get Hands-On again and you're going to learn 
even more skills for building user interfaces  
19:14 - aka the screens of our app click on over here 
to go to the next lesson and I'll see you there

Cleaned transcript:

in the last lesson you use the xcode to build this now in this xcode tutorial I want to take a little more time and show you around so that you can understand what you did and begin to master this tool now you're going to want to pay close attention because over the course of your journey you're going to be spending a lot of time inside xcode turning your app ideas into reality oh and at the end of the video I'll be sharing my xcode tips and tricks with you that I use every day so make sure you watch till the end okay quick note before we begin back in lesson one I showed you how to download and install xcode so if you haven't done that yet go ahead and do that first once you have xcode launched let's get into it all right let's create our new project click create a New Mexico project right here or go to file new and project now there are several options here actually they're templates and you can create apps for different platforms Mac OS watch OS TV OS for cars even multiplatform if you want to launch your app on multiple platforms however we are going to choose IOS app and actually look there's game AR apps there's iMessage sticker packs a ton of stuff we're going to stick with the basics for now this is a good starting Place let's click next and here let me explain some of these options for you so they don't look so cryptic first of all product name is easy right we're just going to put whatever we want to name this app now team is something that I want to explain remember packing less one when we talked about the process to launch your app into the story well the code from xcode that gets turned into a code package and then you have to code sign it as in put your digital signature on it so that people can't impersonate you and then that's the thing that gets put into the App Store well this here is how you're going to code sign it and to get a team on the drop down here you actually have to sign up for the Apple developer program which is

for the purpose of these demos we can leave it as none now what's more important though is this bundle identifier because this is the unique ID for your app and this has to be unique for all apps on

you are taking this seriously and you are going to continue on learning create a space in your hard drive a folder perhaps for all of your apps and projects so that they can stay organized for myself I'll admit I'm a bit of a messy person and this is a demo so I'm just going to create out my desktop Source control now this if you don't know what this is it's kind of like versioning so imagine being able to take snapshots of your project and code so that later on if you accidentally break your project and it's not working anymore you can always roll back to one of your snapshots this is kind of like time machine on the Mac if you've ever used that so definitely a very good practice in software development in fact kind of mandatory if you're working professionally for us right now we are going to leave this unchecked because I will introduce this to you later on okay let's go ahead and create it and let's check out our brand new project so here's our branding project before we dive into each of these files and I tell you what they're for let us talk about the major big areas of xcode so you can get acquainted so there are five main areas of xcode firstly on the left hand

editor area there's also a lot of cool little tucked away things to make editing easier such as across the top here you can have tabs there's breadcrumb you can even jump within the file and you can open up you can split up this editor area into multiple panes window panes as well which I'll show you closer to the end of this lesson for now let's move on to the right most side this is the inspector area sometimes people call it the utility area which will work as well however what this is for is it allows you to configure whatever you are working on or looking at inside the editor area so for example if we um you know you've seen this if I put my cursor on one of the view elements here I would be able to configure it right if I put my cursor on this thing called view there's nothing I can configure with this keyword view however if I click across the tabs here there is a quick help tab now this is useful because it tells me what this view keyword means and what it does here this tab is the identity tab it tells me where this file exists where this content view exists on my hard drive right and what app membership does it belong to and things like that so that's what the inspector area is good for now I don't know if you've noticed but there is a cascading effect going on right if I select this it changes this if I select something in the editor area it changes what happens in the inspectors area so think left to right waterfall next up let's look at the top toolbar now first of all this leftmost button hides your Navigators if you need more space on your laptop maybe your screen is kind of small you can make more space on the right hand side there's a similar button to hide the inspectors area so now you get a full editor area for editing there is this run button to run your app inside a simulator like we did in lesson one and here you can click on the simulator select a different one you can test your app on all sorts of different simulators also if you plug in your device into your computer you are going to see that device here and you can choose it and you can actually launch your app on that device so that's something we're going to do in this video series so don't worry about that we'll get to that there when you first plug in your phone you're going to get a popup on your phone saying do you trust this computer you're going to have to say trust before you can actually see it on this menu just in case you're doing it right now here it tells you what's happening behind the scenes sometimes you know if you're saying thinking xcode is slow it might be because it's doing something behind the scenes and this is the status bar that tells you what's going on now this exclude cloud is something that you don't have to worry about yet but it's a it's a way for you to be able to run your projects and test you know run those test cases that I told you about when we created the project it's a way to run those test cases on the cloud on Apple's servers the reason is because sometimes these take quite a while to run and also um you might want to run those tests on multiple different devices and so you can deploy those things to the cloud and run them there this icon we've used before it's the library right so if we go back to the content View and you click this plus icon there's our library that's so useful and then yep we talked about this icon so that's the toolbar now that you know your way around xcode let's take a look at your project files so let's start at the very root of your xcode project which is inside your file Navigator this node right here now this is where you can configure different things for your project these are things like what is the version number what is the display name should it be able to display in various orientations and all the things like that actually this is probably pretty important what iOS version should it be able to install on you might set 16 and nothing lower than that will be able to install your app and this is for the reason that sometimes you're using features which are only available on let's say iOS 16. uh so that is the root project node here is also where you would configure different things like uh you might have to add different capabilities to your app such as Game Center or being able to do uh inapp purchases or notifications or things like that you have to add different things and just in general there's a whole ton of settings this is your project settings now after that there is a folder inside contains a couple more files you've got this entry point this is where your app starts okay this is the first thing that gets executed before it launches the first screen of your app and that is what this is content view if we click onto the next file that is content view you can see here this is what it looks like and uh the entry point if you click back here you can see that it creates a Content view so that makes sense right this is the entry point for your app when the app launches it creates this screen content view which is what you see here and in fact when you launch it in the simulator this is the first screen that you see so hopefully that makes a lot of sense and next you have your asset Library which stores all of your colors your image assets and even this is where you'd specify your app icon you just place an image into here to have that be your app icon and then inside preview content is another asset library but this is just only specifically for the previews here that you see so if you perhaps you know sometimes previewing doesn't make sense if there's no data to preview right like for example if you've got a scrollable list of photos but you don't have any actual photos there's nothing really to see right so this is where you would put those test or preview assets to be used and that in a nutshell are all of your files in your xcode project next up let's see how we can test our app now in terms of testing your app we mentioned the simulator in lesson one so just as a recap you can select a simulator of your choice here and then you can hit this run button and it's going to launch an onscreen virtual device if this is the first time you're doing it expect a couple of minutes for this to boot up but here this is a great way to test your app you can click through all the screens and interact with it you can simulate different device features such as low memory situations or low Network situations to see how your app would behave and in general just test your app this preview here in the editor area is actually great for seeing how your screen looks like as you build it and there are a couple of tools for that for example there are zooming capabilities here you can zoom in zoom out Zoom to fit and zoom to 100 that's what these different buttons do you can also look at variations for example I can look at what dark mode would look like on my phone or I could look at landscape orientation if this is too tedious you can look at multiple variations At Once by clicking this button right here and for example I can click color scheme and that's going to show me light and dark I can click on orientation for example or maybe Dynamic type and see how different font sizes look on the UI and then finally we have these two different modes by default it's on this live mode which lets you you interact with the elements on your preview for example I may add a button let's open up the library under views search for button you'll see it there and click and drag it you'll see a button you can see by default I'm on live mode down here and I can interact with this there is another Mode called selectable mode or select mode and it allows you just simply to select your elements perhaps you want to see the corresponding code for that element so that's a great way to learn another functionality is selecting an element so that you can configure it in the inspector area that's pretty helpful as well and now I want to leave you with some xcode tips that I use every single day inside xcode these are so useful and it may not be apparent right now but as you start well as we start building the app in this video series you're going to see us using these so the first one probably the most basic one is this one here these go back and go forward arrows these work just like your web browser arrows and sometimes let's say you're moving from this file to this file to another file here and there these buttons just let you jump back to the place you were in so when you're working with code sometimes it the the code file gets really long and this breadcrumb right here allows you to jump between different sections in your file which is really handy here you can actually jump to different files as well clicking the spread Chrome right here on the upper right hand corner here there are a few useful things as well so this middle icon allows you to customize how the editor looks so if you choose show editor only you're you don't need the preview perhaps you can click that right you can also there's this mini map which is quite useful as well which lets you uh scrub your file so if your file was very very long this would be an easy way to just sort of navigate and you can see at a glance what your file is looking like uh if you want to let's say look at two files side by side you could do that by clicking this upper right hand corner button and opening two editors side by side and obviously the more screen real estate that you have the more useful this becomes um as for now it is probably not very useful for me with the size of this xcode window and with the size of the font that I have right here but nonetheless you know that this is available to you and there are different tabs right here as you can see here now as you code more you'll undoubtedly run into a situation where you're wondering what else can the vstack do or can the v stack do this or that so I'm happy to say that documentation is embedded right into xcode now you can just Google vstack and find it or there are a couple of fast ways to do that with an xcode so one way is go into Windows developer documentation and you can just search up vstack in here I've already found it but yeah you can do that you can look look at what it can do how to use it and things like that an easier way even faster it's just put putting your cursor over it and using the inspector panel and going over to this quick help section and then you can even click on the link here to open it to that page even faster if you want to hold down the option or Alt key on your keyboard hover over vstack and you can get a popup dialog for that again there's a link to open the developer documentation really handy stuff all right so now you know all about the file Navigator the editor area the inspector area the toolbar and the debug area and you know how to start your own Xcode project and what each of the files in your project is for in the next lesson we're going to get HandsOn again and you're going to learn even more skills for building user interfaces aka the screens of our app click on over here to go to the next lesson and I'll see you there
