00:05 - hey guys welcome to Lesson Four of how
00:08 - to make iPhone apps with no programming
00:10 - experience in this lesson we're going to
00:13 - talk about the anatomy of an iPhone app
00:15 - we're going to go over the major
00:17 - components that all iPhone apps have in
00:19 - common so before we dive into xcode and
00:21 - show you how the app project represents
00:24 - those different components we're going
00:25 - to go over the different parts of an
00:28 - iPhone app first
00:30 - the first component is the view and this
00:33 - is what the user sees and interacts with
00:35 - on their phone the second component is
00:38 - the view controller and the view
00:40 - controller manages the view we're going
00:42 - to go into what that means a little
00:45 - later in this lesson the third component
00:48 - is the model and the model manages the
00:50 - data for your
00:52 - app okay so how do these three
00:54 - components work together to form a
00:57 - functioning app well The View controller
01:00 - sits in between the model and the view
01:03 - and manages the communication between
01:05 - the two so for example The View
01:08 - controller may ask the model for some
01:11 - data for example a list of
01:14 - contacts and then the view controller
01:16 - will pass that data to the view to
01:18 - render it to the user now similarly if
01:21 - the user interacts with the view and
01:24 - let's say deletes a contact then the
01:26 - view controller gets that interaction or
01:29 - gets that message and passes it to the
01:33 - model to tell it to remove a contact
01:36 - because the model manages the data so as
01:39 - you can see each component has its own
01:41 - set of responsibilities and a role
01:44 - within the app and they must work
01:46 - together to form a functioning app now
01:49 - this division of labor and the way that
01:52 - the communication happens between each
01:54 - component is a well-known design pattern
01:56 - in programming called model view
01:58 - controller pattern or MVC for short and
02:02 - a design pattern is simply a best
02:04 - practice pattern or way to solve a
02:06 - common problem iOS development makes use
02:09 - of this design pattern heavily to
02:11 - structure the way that apps are built by
02:14 - following this design pattern it's
02:16 - easier to maintain and change the code
02:18 - in the future if necessary because each
02:20 - component has a well- defined and
02:22 - contained set of responsibilities it's
02:25 - easy to swap in and out the components
02:28 - in the future if you need to to make an
02:30 - update and it also helps with
02:32 - troubleshooting your code if you have a
02:34 - bug in your code depending on what sort
02:36 - of bug it is if it's a display issue or
02:40 - a data issue you'd know where to look
02:42 - instead of if all of the
02:44 - responsibilities were merged or melded
02:47 - together you would have to look at the
02:49 - overall project instead of just a single
02:53 - component in the next lesson when we
02:55 - build our first app I'll point out to
02:57 - you where these different components
02:59 - exist in the app project
