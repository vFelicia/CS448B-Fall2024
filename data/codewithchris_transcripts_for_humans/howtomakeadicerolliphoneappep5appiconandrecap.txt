00:05 - okay so now what's left to do is to add
00:09 - the app icon into the application as you
00:12 - can see right now when we run it
00:16 - there is no app icon and actually this
00:19 - would be a good time to point out that
00:21 - in iOS 7 they recommend that your app
00:23 - icon follows this sort of paradigm and
00:25 - we'll get into that another video about
00:27 - how to design your app icon but because
00:30 - I originally built this app when iOS 7
00:32 - hand come out yet the app icon that you
00:34 - downloaded it looks like this I'm pretty
00:37 - sure that that doesn't follow that iOS 7
00:41 - at paradigm but I'm going to add it to
00:43 - the application anyways so for Xcode 5
00:46 - what you do is by default it's using the
00:49 - app icon in the app catalog so you just
00:53 - have to go to the asset catalog make
00:55 - sure you select app icon right here and
00:56 - under the iPhone app iOS 7 you can
00:59 - right-click and you can import an image
01:00 - for your app icon so mines on the
01:03 - desktop and then drag it in there like
01:10 - that
01:10 - so now when you run your application
01:12 - you'll see the icon you can run it stop
01:15 - it and then go take a look and you'll
01:17 - see your icon there the shortcut key to
01:20 - hit for the home key is command shift +
01:23 - H but there's a menu command for that in
01:25 - here as well yeah so there it is you can
01:30 - see that now if you don't see your icon
01:35 - reflected it might be that you need to
01:38 - just completely uninstall the app and
01:42 - then just run it and try it again
01:44 - and your image their icon should be
01:47 - reflected now in Xcode 4 because you
01:50 - guys don't have the image asset catalog
01:53 - what you can do is go to the project
01:55 - settings and then you'll scroll down
01:58 - it'll look a little different but then
01:59 - you'll still see a section that says app
02:01 - icons and it's got a couple of empty
02:03 - squares or empty placeholders and you
02:06 - just have to drag the icon into your
02:08 - Xcode project and then browse for it
02:10 - through the project settings here
02:12 - and after you add it there you run the
02:14 - project and you'll see that app icon so
02:17 - let's do a recap of what we practiced in
02:20 - this application so in this app used
02:22 - storyboards you created a model you
02:25 - wrote some code to randomize numbers and
02:28 - you also created a custom view and added
02:32 - it into your main view you've added an
02:34 - app icon and also you've practiced
02:37 - declaring your own properties and
02:39 - methods by hand and not using the ID
02:40 - outlet method I hope that was pretty
02:43 - easy to follow along and I appreciate
02:45 - you guys watching please share it with
02:47 - any of your friends or colleagues who
02:49 - are interested in iPhone development and
02:51 - help me spread the word and as usual the
02:53 - notes are in the description below as
02:55 - well as the link to the source code and
02:57 - the image assets thanks for watching bye
03:00 - bye
