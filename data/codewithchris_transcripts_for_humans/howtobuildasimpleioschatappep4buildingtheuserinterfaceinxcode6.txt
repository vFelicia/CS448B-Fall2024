00:05 - hello welcome youtubers in this lesson
00:08 - we're going to create the user interface
00:10 - for our simple chat app or at least
00:13 - start it and we're going to be adding a
00:16 - table view which is simply a list of the
00:18 - chat messages and to accomplish this
00:21 - we're going to need some of the concepts
00:23 - that were covered in the start here
00:25 - lessons so if you haven't done that I
00:28 - would recommend you to go through those
00:30 - lessons first and you can find those
00:32 - lessons on my channel page furthermore
00:35 - we're also going to need some of the
00:37 - concepts that deals with table views
00:39 - delegates and protocols and stuff which
00:42 - is covered in the full beginner course
00:44 - that you can find on my site now
00:46 - recognizing that that's a paid course
00:48 - and that not all of you may have taken
00:50 - that course I'm going to briefly explain
00:53 - the concepts which you need when we
00:55 - reach them and I'm going to provide some
00:57 - further information to the documentation
01:00 - in the video below so you can do some
01:03 - further reading as well but I'm gonna go
01:05 - slowly and explain things as I go along
01:08 - and hopefully you guys can follow so
01:11 - right here I have the simple chat app
01:14 - Xcode project that we started in the
01:16 - previous lesson and just to do a quick
01:18 - recap what we did last lesson was we
01:21 - imported the parse framework and in the
01:24 - viewcontroller.swift in the viewdidload
01:26 - method we added some code to just test
01:30 - that connection that saves an object as
01:32 - a test class here so we're gonna delete
01:35 - these three lines because that was just
01:36 - a test I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna
01:40 - go back to the main dot storyboard
01:42 - because this is where we're going to
01:44 - construct our user interface okay so a
01:49 - lot of you guys asked why this is a
01:52 - square and not you know the shape of an
01:56 - iPhone well down here is something
01:59 - called size classes and right here it's
02:02 - set to with any and height any and
02:04 - that's just so it can accommodate any
02:06 - width and height because there are so
02:08 - many different screen sizes we no longer
02:10 - drag and lay things out visually and
02:13 - said we lay things out using Auto layout
02:16 - by specifying rules and constraints as
02:19 - you're going to see so start by going to
02:22 - this right-hand side this inspector pane
02:25 - if you don't have it there's this icon
02:27 - here you can open it and down here in
02:30 - the lower right hand corner make sure
02:31 - you're on this objects tab this objects
02:34 - library here and so you can search in it
02:37 - and search for table table view we see
02:42 - that there I'm going to just grab and
02:44 - drag that on to my view here notice how
02:48 - on this left-hand pane that the table
02:51 - view now appears underneath the view
02:52 - here and if you don't see this there's a
02:55 - little icon down here that you can click
02:57 - to you know hide or show that so now our
03:00 - table view we have here and what I'm
03:04 - going to do is grab this little handle
03:06 - here and make a little bit of space but
03:09 - keep in mind by me visually doing this
03:12 - does not mean that this is how it's
03:13 - going to show up when you run the app we
03:15 - have to add constraints and how you do
03:18 - that is through these buttons down here
03:20 - so I've got my table view highlighted
03:22 - I'm gonna choose this here where we can
03:24 - add some new constraints and I'm going
03:27 - to click this bar on the top the left
03:31 - and the right and I'm going to set that
03:33 - to zero so it's zero against the left
03:37 - against the right and against the top
03:39 - and constraint margins is checked so
03:41 - it's going to leave some room for
03:43 - margins wherever it needs to I'm gonna
03:46 - click the add three constraints so now
03:49 - there are three rules that have been
03:51 - added that govern the left side the
03:54 - right side and the top side of the table
03:55 - view where it should go but there's
03:57 - nothing governing the bottom yet you'll
03:59 - see why in a second in the object
04:02 - library in the search for view scroll
04:06 - down until you see actually search for a
04:08 - UI view you got exactly what you need
04:10 - this view here I'm gonna drag that and
04:13 - put it in here make sure you don't drag
04:15 - it into the table view so I've got it
04:17 - right here in the document outline here
04:21 - you can see that this is the new view I
04:23 - added I'm going to hit enter it's
04:26 - that rename it to dock view make sure
04:30 - it's underneath the table view but not
04:32 - nested under the table view so for
04:35 - example if it looks like that then that
04:39 - dock you go is actually inside the table
04:41 - view we don't want that and you can just
04:43 - drag it back out like that so make sure
04:45 - the dock view is underneath the table
04:49 - view but not inside of it okay so we've
04:51 - got our dock view here I'm just gonna
04:52 - position it visually here ah
04:57 - so I've accidentally moved it into the
04:59 - table view again so let's drag it back
05:02 - out I'm just gonna position it a little
05:09 - bit but you know we're gonna position it
05:11 - with Auto layout constraints anyways
05:13 - okay so make sure your dock view is
05:16 - selected and then click this menu we're
05:20 - going to add three constraints this time
05:22 - to the left right and the bottom I'm
05:25 - gonna say zero zero and zero so that
05:28 - dock view is gonna be flush to the left
05:30 - right in the bottom furthermore I'm
05:33 - gonna specify a height I'm gonna give it
05:35 - a height of let's say 60 and here we've
05:40 - specified four constraints we've
05:41 - specified a height constraint a left a
05:44 - right and the bottom and actually it's
05:47 - changed so make sure that that's zero so
05:52 - we've got one two three and the height
05:54 - constraint at 60 add these four
05:57 - constraints and then furthermore click
06:01 - this one which is the icon beside it and
06:03 - go update all frames like under all
06:08 - views and view controller click update
06:10 - frames so you get that I'm going to
06:14 - change the background so select the dock
06:15 - view from this document outline again
06:18 - and in the background let's just change
06:20 - it to a dark grey color so you can
06:21 - actually see it now click the table view
06:25 - again you can choose it from the
06:27 - document outline if that's easier
06:30 - go click this menu and now we're going
06:33 - to add a bottom constraint remember for
06:36 - the table view we only added a left to
06:37 - right and top last time
06:39 - so now we're gonna add a bottom one
06:41 - click this little triangle here where
06:45 - you get to select our neighbor we're
06:47 - going to select the dock view as our
06:49 - neighbor and I'm gonna put 0 so what
06:52 - this means is we're saying that the
06:54 - bottom of the table view should be 0
06:59 - pixels flush against the top of the dock
07:02 - view and put 0 there and then add that
07:08 - constraint you can see that this orange
07:10 - line appears showing you that you need
07:15 - to update the frames so we'll go ahead
07:18 - and update frames again and now you've
07:21 - got everything positioned so you've got
07:23 - your dock view here that is aligned to
07:26 - the bottom the right and the left and
07:29 - it's got a height of 60 and you've got
07:31 - your table view which is aligned to the
07:32 - top left and right and 0 right up
07:37 - against the dock view all those
07:41 - constraints can be found here and here
07:45 - for the high constraint before we leave
07:48 - this storyboard we're going to select
07:50 - our table view and then on the right
07:53 - hand side in the in attributes inspector
07:56 - for the prototype cells we're going to
07:59 - put one press tab then you'll see that
08:02 - prototype cell up here right here if you
08:05 - click that prototype cell or you can
08:09 - select it from up here on the right hand
08:14 - side there's the identifier if you don't
08:16 - see this identifier then you might have
08:18 - selected the content view instead just
08:21 - go up one level and select the table
08:24 - view cell if you just open up this
08:26 - document outline you can see here it
08:29 - says table view cell so select that and
08:32 - then on the right hand side there is
08:34 - identifier so you can specify an
08:36 - identifier for the cell and you'll see
08:38 - why it's going to be important so I'm
08:40 - gonna type in message cell that's the
08:44 - identifier that we're going to give this
08:46 - prototype cell so what is a prototype
08:49 - cell well it's basically a cell that we
08:52 - can custom
08:53 - and then we can put an identifier on it
08:55 - to later create more instances of the
08:58 - cell when the tableview asks the
09:00 - viewcontroller for a cell to display
09:02 - some data we can use that identifier to
09:05 - create a new instance of our custom cell
09:07 - and return it to the table view so in
09:10 - this case we're not really going to
09:11 - customize it it's got by default a label
09:14 - in there which we're going to use to
09:15 - display the message text but we're going
09:18 - to give it an identifier of message cell
09:21 - so that later we can create instances of
09:23 - this basic cell now we're done in the
09:27 - storyboard so far we're going to move
09:30 - into the view controller a lot Swift to
09:31 - hook up the table view so go up to the
09:34 - upper right hand corner and hit this
09:36 - icon show the assistant editor and what
09:39 - this does is it puts the storyboard
09:42 - side-by-side along with the view
09:44 - controller that controls this view and
09:48 - what we're going to do is expose the
09:50 - table view as an outlet so that we can
09:55 - reference it in our Swift code and if
09:58 - you went through the start here beginner
09:59 - lessons you should have done this before
10:01 - but hold down ctrl on your keyboard and
10:04 - click the table view from the document
10:06 - outline and drag all the way here
10:09 - underneath class you can let go and
10:12 - you'll see that the connection is outlet
10:14 - the type is UI tableview and we can give
10:16 - it a name we can call it our message
10:19 - table view and then just hit enter and
10:22 - you'll see that it created an outlet
10:25 - here called message table view which is
10:28 - connected to this table view element we
10:30 - added in the storyboard so in our swift
10:33 - code in here we can refer to this name
10:36 - to work with that table view element ok
10:41 - let's go back to single view or standard
10:44 - editor go to view controller dot Swift
10:48 - now by clicking it in your file
10:49 - navigator ok so this is a good point to
10:53 - end the lesson in the next video we're
10:56 - going to learn about the table view and
10:57 - how to hook it up so that it can display
10:59 - data thanks for watching and I'll see
11:02 - you guys next time bye
11:03 - now

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome youtubers in this lesson we're going to create the user interface for our simple chat app or at least start it and we're going to be adding a table view which is simply a list of the chat messages and to accomplish this we're going to need some of the concepts that were covered in the start here lessons so if you haven't done that I would recommend you to go through those lessons first and you can find those lessons on my channel page furthermore we're also going to need some of the concepts that deals with table views delegates and protocols and stuff which is covered in the full beginner course that you can find on my site now recognizing that that's a paid course and that not all of you may have taken that course I'm going to briefly explain the concepts which you need when we reach them and I'm going to provide some further information to the documentation in the video below so you can do some further reading as well but I'm gonna go slowly and explain things as I go along and hopefully you guys can follow so right here I have the simple chat app Xcode project that we started in the previous lesson and just to do a quick recap what we did last lesson was we imported the parse framework and in the viewcontroller.swift in the viewdidload method we added some code to just test that connection that saves an object as a test class here so we're gonna delete these three lines because that was just a test I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna go back to the main dot storyboard because this is where we're going to construct our user interface okay so a lot of you guys asked why this is a square and not you know the shape of an iPhone well down here is something called size classes and right here it's set to with any and height any and that's just so it can accommodate any width and height because there are so many different screen sizes we no longer drag and lay things out visually and said we lay things out using Auto layout by specifying rules and constraints as you're going to see so start by going to this righthand side this inspector pane if you don't have it there's this icon here you can open it and down here in the lower right hand corner make sure you're on this objects tab this objects library here and so you can search in it and search for table table view we see that there I'm going to just grab and drag that on to my view here notice how on this lefthand pane that the table view now appears underneath the view here and if you don't see this there's a little icon down here that you can click to you know hide or show that so now our table view we have here and what I'm going to do is grab this little handle here and make a little bit of space but keep in mind by me visually doing this does not mean that this is how it's going to show up when you run the app we have to add constraints and how you do that is through these buttons down here so I've got my table view highlighted I'm gonna choose this here where we can add some new constraints and I'm going to click this bar on the top the left and the right and I'm going to set that to zero so it's zero against the left against the right and against the top and constraint margins is checked so it's going to leave some room for margins wherever it needs to I'm gonna click the add three constraints so now there are three rules that have been added that govern the left side the right side and the top side of the table view where it should go but there's nothing governing the bottom yet you'll see why in a second in the object library in the search for view scroll down until you see actually search for a UI view you got exactly what you need this view here I'm gonna drag that and put it in here make sure you don't drag it into the table view so I've got it right here in the document outline here you can see that this is the new view I added I'm going to hit enter it's that rename it to dock view make sure it's underneath the table view but not nested under the table view so for example if it looks like that then that dock you go is actually inside the table view we don't want that and you can just drag it back out like that so make sure the dock view is underneath the table view but not inside of it okay so we've got our dock view here I'm just gonna position it visually here ah so I've accidentally moved it into the table view again so let's drag it back out I'm just gonna position it a little bit but you know we're gonna position it with Auto layout constraints anyways okay so make sure your dock view is selected and then click this menu we're going to add three constraints this time to the left right and the bottom I'm gonna say zero zero and zero so that dock view is gonna be flush to the left right in the bottom furthermore I'm gonna specify a height I'm gonna give it a height of let's say 60 and here we've specified four constraints we've specified a height constraint a left a right and the bottom and actually it's changed so make sure that that's zero so we've got one two three and the height constraint at 60 add these four constraints and then furthermore click this one which is the icon beside it and go update all frames like under all views and view controller click update frames so you get that I'm going to change the background so select the dock view from this document outline again and in the background let's just change it to a dark grey color so you can actually see it now click the table view again you can choose it from the document outline if that's easier go click this menu and now we're going to add a bottom constraint remember for the table view we only added a left to right and top last time so now we're gonna add a bottom one click this little triangle here where you get to select our neighbor we're going to select the dock view as our neighbor and I'm gonna put 0 so what this means is we're saying that the bottom of the table view should be 0 pixels flush against the top of the dock view and put 0 there and then add that constraint you can see that this orange line appears showing you that you need to update the frames so we'll go ahead and update frames again and now you've got everything positioned so you've got your dock view here that is aligned to the bottom the right and the left and it's got a height of 60 and you've got your table view which is aligned to the top left and right and 0 right up against the dock view all those constraints can be found here and here for the high constraint before we leave this storyboard we're going to select our table view and then on the right hand side in the in attributes inspector for the prototype cells we're going to put one press tab then you'll see that prototype cell up here right here if you click that prototype cell or you can select it from up here on the right hand side there's the identifier if you don't see this identifier then you might have selected the content view instead just go up one level and select the table view cell if you just open up this document outline you can see here it says table view cell so select that and then on the right hand side there is identifier so you can specify an identifier for the cell and you'll see why it's going to be important so I'm gonna type in message cell that's the identifier that we're going to give this prototype cell so what is a prototype cell well it's basically a cell that we can custom and then we can put an identifier on it to later create more instances of the cell when the tableview asks the viewcontroller for a cell to display some data we can use that identifier to create a new instance of our custom cell and return it to the table view so in this case we're not really going to customize it it's got by default a label in there which we're going to use to display the message text but we're going to give it an identifier of message cell so that later we can create instances of this basic cell now we're done in the storyboard so far we're going to move into the view controller a lot Swift to hook up the table view so go up to the upper right hand corner and hit this icon show the assistant editor and what this does is it puts the storyboard sidebyside along with the view controller that controls this view and what we're going to do is expose the table view as an outlet so that we can reference it in our Swift code and if you went through the start here beginner lessons you should have done this before but hold down ctrl on your keyboard and click the table view from the document outline and drag all the way here underneath class you can let go and you'll see that the connection is outlet the type is UI tableview and we can give it a name we can call it our message table view and then just hit enter and you'll see that it created an outlet here called message table view which is connected to this table view element we added in the storyboard so in our swift code in here we can refer to this name to work with that table view element ok let's go back to single view or standard editor go to view controller dot Swift now by clicking it in your file navigator ok so this is a good point to end the lesson in the next video we're going to learn about the table view and how to hook it up so that it can display data thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time bye now
