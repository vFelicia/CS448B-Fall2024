00:00 - hey it's Chris here thank you so much for learning 
with us now you may or may not have known but we  
00:04 - do have a paid program called CWC plus and 
we've made some big improvements to it so I  
00:09 - want to show you what it is full disclosure 
of this video is all about CWC plus and how  
00:13 - it may be able to help you achieve your goals 
but if you're not interested in joining a paid  
00:18 - program that's totally fine feel free to click 
out of this video and I'll see you in the next  
00:22 - YouTube tutorial I still very much appreciate 
that you are here learning with us so thank you  
00:27 - for that however if you are interested and hearing 
about the program or if you're on the fence about  
00:32 - joining then let's dive in and see how CWC plus 
may be able to help you so if you're setting  
00:38 - out to learn iOS whether it's to get a job or to 
build your own apps for Fun and Profit you have  
00:43 - several options these are all The Usual Suspects 
and they all have their pros and cons but if we  
00:48 - were to measure it in terms of time and financial 
commitment it would look something like this you  
00:53 - might be confused about why free resources take up 
a lot of time and that's because you have to spend  
00:57 - time digging through all of the free resources to 
find the ones that are right for you and then you  
01:02 - have to spend time piecing it together yourself 
into a learning path and then often times the  
01:07 - result is a learning path with material from 
multiple sources now I might be biased but I  
01:13 - personally think that online courses are The Sweet 
Spot because they are typically not that expensive  
01:17 - they're flexible for your schedule and there's 
usually some sort of curriculum that the course  
01:22 - takes you through however even if you find a great 
online course there are still potential issues for  
01:28 - example there may be a teaching Style mismatch 
for some reason you're just not understanding  
01:32 - the way that the instructor is presenting it 
or maybe it's too technical it's too fast it  
01:38 - could be a variety of reasons but the teaching 
style is just not for you the training material  
01:42 - could be outdated with apple making changes and 
updates every single year training material gets  
01:47 - outdated pretty quickly unless the instructor or 
the course owner is updating the material actively  
01:54 - there may not be enough support for you as you 
are going through your Learning Journey if you  
01:58 - have questions how fast are you getting a response 
are you getting helped personally or are you being  
02:05 - sent to an FAQ or to browse comment sections 
don't overlook support this is a huge part  
02:11 - of being able to learn something there could be a 
lack of direction does the course just get you to  
02:17 - build a whole bunch of apps or does it actually 
have a clear goal that by the end of the course  
02:23 - you will have gained some tangible skills that 
are actually useful towards a bigger Journey  
02:29 - with which leads us to number five is there a lack 
of progression so you don't just want to take one  
02:36 - course and that's it because usually one course 
is not enough to get you to the result that you  
02:42 - want the thing you should look out for is there a 
progression or path that you are working towards  
02:48 - to ultimately help you achieve your goal now let 
me explain to you how CWC plus addresses these  
02:54 - problems you see cc+ used to be a big library 
of courses and this year we realized that it  
03:00 - is not a very effective way to help students 
achieve a result so we had to make a change  
03:06 - we've redesigned CWC plus to be for people who 
have a goal of building apps for Fun and Profit  
03:11 - and for people who want to start a career in 
iOS so when you join CWC plus that's what we're  
03:16 - working towards we're going to help you get there 
through a series of programs each with specific  
03:21 - outcomes the first program that everyone starts 
with is launch your first app the transformation  
03:27 - you'll make from taking this program is going 
from no coding experience to having a published  
03:32 - app in the app store the program consists of 
Foundations networking databases and the App  
03:37 - Store course each of these courses have their own 
agenda but they were actually designed together as  
03:43 - a progression towards the end goal of publishing 
an app in other words each course builds off of  
03:49 - the previous course so that by the time you get 
to the App Store course you have a well-rounded  
03:54 - set of skills to design and publish your own 
apps after you graduate from launch your first  
03:59 - app you're ready for the next program to take you 
another step closer to your ultimate goal we're  
04:05 - designing and launching the rest of the programs 
in 2024 so that covers Direction and progression  
04:11 - now let's talk about support and I would argue 
that having proper support is half of the learning  
04:17 - experience and is absolutely crucial for you to 
make progress on your iOS Journey now inside CWC  
04:23 - plus each student gets personalized chat support 
with one of our coaches to get through all of the  
04:28 - material in the launch your first app program now 
I don't know of any other courses that do that and  
04:34 - I think it's a huge advantage of learning with us 
now to talk about how updated these courses are  
04:40 - all of the courses of launch your first app was 
recorded this year so that's about as updated as  
04:45 - you can get finally in regards to teaching style 
I'm the instructor for all of the courses in the  
04:49 - program and you can get a sense of my teaching 
from this video right here so you can watch that  
04:54 - and you can see if you're actually getting results 
by learning with me before you commit to joining  
04:58 - CWC plus so if CWC plus sounds like something that 
can benefit you right now we are running Black  
05:05 - Friday Limited Time pricing go ahead and visit 
cc. to/ bf22 3 to see it and I'll also include  
05:12 - the link in the description below the video now 
whether or not you decide to join the program I  
05:17 - still really appreciate that you're here learning 
with us so give it some thought and hopefully I'll  
05:21 - see you inside if not I'll see you in the next 
YouTube video thanks for watching and take care
