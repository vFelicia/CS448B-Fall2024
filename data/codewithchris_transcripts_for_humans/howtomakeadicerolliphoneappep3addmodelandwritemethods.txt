With timestamps:

00:06 - so in MVC fashion what we want to do is
00:10 - create data model and that model is
00:12 - going to be supplying the random numbers
00:14 - for us so I'm going to create a new file
00:18 - it's going to be a new objective c class
00:21 - and this time it's going to be a
00:23 - subclass of nsobject just your plain old
00:25 - objective c class and we call it the
00:27 - dice theta controller ok so in dice data
00:36 - controller it's going to need a public
00:38 - method and it's got to be public because
00:40 - other classes will need to know that
00:42 - this class has a method so that it can
00:44 - use it if it was a private method the
00:46 - view controller could call on the dice
00:48 - data controller but it wouldn't even be
00:50 - aware that it had any methods to use so
00:52 - i'm going to type out a method signature
00:55 - here called get dye number and then what
00:59 - I like to do is just copy that and
01:01 - switch to the implementation file and
01:04 - then in here we're going to write the
01:05 - code for it so I'm going to paste that
01:07 - signature and add the curly braces now
01:09 - i'm going to write some code to randomly
01:11 - generate a number from one to six and
01:13 - then return it actually it's a good
01:16 - point right now my method signature says
01:19 - void so that means that when any other
01:21 - class calls this method it's not going
01:23 - to expect anything back but what we
01:25 - actually want to do is return a number
01:28 - return an integer so it's complaining
01:30 - now because now the method signatures
01:32 - don't match so I'm going to go here back
01:33 - to the header file I'm going to change
01:35 - this to int now it's reminding me that I
01:39 - need to return something in this method
01:41 - so I'm going to clear a new int variable
01:44 - and I'm going to use a math function
01:47 - called arc for random now this method
01:49 - generates a random number but I want to
01:51 - make sure that it's within the bounds
01:53 - that I want so I'm going to mod it by
01:54 - six and this is going to give me 0 to 5
01:57 - and I'm going to add one so that it's
01:59 - going to give me from one to six I'm
02:02 - going to return our so this method
02:04 - basically gets a random number between 1
02:06 - to 6 and returns it ok the next thing
02:09 - we'll want to do is to implement our
02:11 - dive you method so right now the dive
02:13 - it was just a plain uiview it doesn't do
02:15 - anything and it has nothing to show but
02:17 - we're going to change that we're going
02:18 - to manually declare an imageview
02:21 - property if you need a reminder of the
02:37 - property syntax on how to declare a
02:39 - property go back to lesson 7 of the
02:42 - basics series to find out okay and I'm
02:45 - also going to declare a method for the
02:47 - dive you wear when this method is called
02:49 - I'm going to create a method so that
02:51 - when this method gets called it changes
02:54 - the image in the dye image view property
02:58 - so this time this method doesn't need to
03:01 - return anything because it's just doing
03:03 - something to the image property I'm
03:05 - going to call it showed I number and
03:07 - it's going to need to accept a single
03:09 - parameter it needs to know which number
03:11 - to show so this method is going to
03:13 - accept a number now one thing you can do
03:17 - to organize your file a bit is do
03:19 - something like this this pragma mark
03:27 - statement allows you to create almost
03:31 - like a section and if you pull down this
03:34 - you'll see that it's got these headers
03:36 - now and for a really long file these
03:38 - things are helpful so now let's
03:39 - implement the show die method and copy
03:42 - the method signature and go into the
03:44 - implementation file of dive you copy
03:49 - that and add the braces and then I'm
03:51 - going to construct a string based on the
03:54 - number that's passed in so for example
03:56 - if someone wanted to show let's say dye
03:59 - number 2 they'd pass in the number two
04:01 - but we need to translate that number
04:03 - into the actual file name of the image
04:05 - so we go to our asset library will know
04:08 - that the images are actually named dice
04:10 - 126 and if you open up the folder where
04:13 - you unzipped it you can see that there
04:15 - are actual PNG's so if we go to dive you
04:18 - what we need to do is construct a string
04:21 - and then append the number to it to form
04:24 - the file name so start by creating
04:26 - a variable to hold the constructed file
04:30 - name and then the NS string class has a
04:33 - class method called string with format
04:35 - and what this allows you to do is you
04:39 - can type the string and then you can put
04:41 - in a wild-card character so mine is
04:44 - going to be percentage D four digit and
04:47 - I'm going to pass in the num variable so
04:49 - what happens this method is going to
04:51 - take in this string and it's going to
04:53 - substitute this parameter into this
04:56 - little wild-card character here so at
04:58 - the end of the day if we pass in two
05:00 - will have dice to PNG which is exactly
05:03 - what we want so now that we've got the
05:05 - file name let's access the the image
05:10 - view what did we call it again die image
05:14 - view so self dot die image view and
05:18 - remember uiimageview has an image
05:21 - property and we've also done this before
05:23 - where we need to assign a uiimage to it
05:26 - so the UI image class has a class method
05:30 - called image named and I'm going to make
05:33 - it look for dice whatever number dot PNG
05:36 - so it's going to create a UI image
05:38 - object and it's going to assign it to
05:40 - the image property of the uiimageview
05:42 - you have to be really careful though
05:45 - because if you notice that this property
05:48 - self thought died image view isn't
05:50 - actually assigned to anything if you
05:53 - notice self dot die image view our
05:56 - property here actually has nothing
05:58 - assigned to it because normally in the
06:00 - past demos where we created the
06:02 - properties using ib outlets and using
06:05 - interface builder these properties
06:07 - automatically get assigned to those UI
06:09 - elements that you dragged into the view
06:11 - but for this view that we created and we
06:13 - you know we typed out this property its
06:16 - we don't have any code to assign
06:18 - something to that property and so if you
06:20 - try to do this you're trying to first of
06:23 - all you're trying to access a property
06:24 - of nothing and then you're trying to
06:26 - sign something to nothing so what we
06:29 - want to do is when dive view gets
06:31 - created we want to initialize the dye
06:34 - image view property by assigning to it a
06:37 - new uiimageview
06:39 - object now in our storyboard here we
06:42 - have these two these two our dive use so
06:45 - when these dive use get created they
06:47 - call a method called and I'm going to
06:50 - override it it's actually going to hit
06:57 - this method so if you don't remember
07:10 - what overriding methods is you should
07:12 - review episode 9 of the basics series
07:16 - I'm going to turn itself here so when
07:19 - you run the app and these two die these
07:21 - get created it actually hits this method
07:24 - for each dive you so what we want to do
07:26 - here is go die image view equals and
07:29 - will create a new uiimageview for it and
07:36 - actually will want to use an it with
07:40 - frame and to an it with frame usually
07:47 - you pass in a wrecked which takes four
07:49 - parameters so where it's positioned on
07:52 - the x-axis where it's positioned on the
07:54 - y axis and then how wide and how tall
07:57 - should this view be so it should this
07:59 - image view be and we want to basically
08:01 - have it take up the whole entire view of
08:04 - the dive you so we're going to do self
08:06 - which refers to this view and this view
08:09 - itself has a frame and it has a size
08:12 - property and finally a width property of
08:15 - that so what is this is doing is it's
08:22 - allocating a new uiimageview object and
08:25 - it's calling the init with frame method
08:27 - on that object so it knows where to put
08:30 - it and this method acepta wrecked so we
08:33 - are using this CG wrecked make to create
08:35 - a wrecked to pass into an it with frame
08:37 - and the wrecked that we're making it's
08:39 - going to start at 0 0 which is the upper
08:41 - left-hand corner and it's going to be as
08:43 - wide as the dye view itself and as tall
08:46 - as the dive view itself which are these
08:48 - two ok great so now we've created we've
08:51 - assigned a
08:52 - uiimageview object to this property so
08:55 - now when this method gets hit this line
08:57 - will actually make sense a network
08:59 - because this property is referring to an
09:01 - object now we still won't see anything
09:04 - on the view because just because we
09:05 - created this uiimageview object we
09:08 - haven't added it to the dive views view
09:11 - yet well the dive you is a view itself
09:13 - so we haven't added it to the view so
09:15 - there's a method of a uiview called add
09:18 - sub view and even though you don't see
09:22 - the sub view method anywhere in this
09:24 - file you remember die view is a subclass
09:27 - of UI view so UI view is the one with
09:31 - this method so I'm going to add the dye
09:36 - image view as a sub view of the dive you
10:12 - all right good stuff so now we've got
10:14 - our dive you ready to accept the number
10:17 - and change the image that it shows and
10:19 - we've got our dice data controller which
10:22 - represents the model in our model view
10:24 - controller pattern returning a random
10:26 - number from one to six I hope that was
10:29 - pretty easy to follow along and I
10:31 - appreciate you guys watching please
10:32 - share it with any of your friends or
10:34 - colleagues who are interested in iphone
10:36 - development and help me spread the word
10:38 - and as usual the notes are in the
10:41 - description below as well as the link to
10:43 - the source code and the image assets

Cleaned transcript:

so in MVC fashion what we want to do is create data model and that model is going to be supplying the random numbers for us so I'm going to create a new file it's going to be a new objective c class and this time it's going to be a subclass of nsobject just your plain old objective c class and we call it the dice theta controller ok so in dice data controller it's going to need a public method and it's got to be public because other classes will need to know that this class has a method so that it can use it if it was a private method the view controller could call on the dice data controller but it wouldn't even be aware that it had any methods to use so i'm going to type out a method signature here called get dye number and then what I like to do is just copy that and switch to the implementation file and then in here we're going to write the code for it so I'm going to paste that signature and add the curly braces now i'm going to write some code to randomly generate a

back but what we actually want to do is return a number return an integer so it's complaining now because now the method signatures don't match so I'm going to go here back to the header file I'm

this method generates a random number but I want to make sure that it's within the bounds that I want so I'm going to mod it by six and this is going to give me 0 to 5 and I'm going to add one so that it's going to give me from one to six I'm going to return our so this method basically gets a random number between 1 to 6 and returns it ok the next thing we'll want to do is to implement our dive you method so right now the dive it was just a plain uiview it doesn't do anything and it has nothing to show but we're going to change that we're going to manually declare an imageview property if you need a reminder of the property syntax on how to declare a property go back to lesson 7 of the basics series to find out okay and I'm also going to declare a method for the dive you wear when this method is called I'm going to create a method so that when this method gets called it changes the image in the dye image view property so this time this method doesn't need to return anything because it's just doing something to the image property I'm going to call it showed I number and it's going to need to accept a single parameter it needs to know which number to show so this method is going to accept a number now one thing you can do to organize your file a bit is do something like this this pragma mark statement allows you to create almost like a section and if you pull down this you'll see that it's got these headers now and for a really long file these things are helpful so now let's implement the show die method and copy the method signature and go into the implementation file of dive you copy that and add the braces and then I'm going to construct a string based on the number that's passed in so for example if someone wanted to show let's say dye number 2 they'd pass in the number two but we need to translate that number into the actual file name of the image so we go to our asset library will know that the images are actually named dice 126 and if you open up the folder

substitute this parameter into this little wildcard character here so at the end of the day if we pass in two will have dice to PNG which is exactly what we want so now that we've got the file name let's access the the image view what did we call it again die image view so self dot die image view and remember uiimageview has an image property and we've also done this before where we need to assign a uiimage to it so the UI image class has a class method called image named and I'm going to make it look for dice whatever number dot PNG so it's going to create a UI image object and it's
