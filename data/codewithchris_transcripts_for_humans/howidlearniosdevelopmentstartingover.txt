00:00 - hey code crew when I first learned IOS app 
development I failed and wasted a lot of  
00:05 - time and then I had to start all over and 
relearn everything the right way now that  
00:10 - was 10 years ago and now that I've been teaching 
beginners how to learn iOS through this channel  
00:15 - code with Chris for so long I have very 
strong opinions on the most effective and  
00:21 - quick way to learn iOS so in this video I'm 
going to share the four things I would do  
00:26 - to quickly and effectively learn iOS if I were 
starting all over again all right let's Dive In  
00:32 - the first thing I do is make sure I'm following 
a structured learning path if you're serious  
00:37 - about picking this up as a skill that you can 
use for a long time you have to learn it the  
00:41 - right way from the ground up for example pretend 
you're learning the language English and you know  
00:46 - nothing right now I teach you that this word is 
pronounced coding would that be helpful or would  
00:51 - it serve you better to First learn the Alphabet 
letter sounds than long versus short vowel sounds  
00:57 - and then endings such as ing learning it the 
second way takes more time but it equips you  
01:03 - with a general framework to pronounce any word 
even those that you've never seen before now the  
01:08 - same idea applies to learning iOS instead of just 
following a one-off tutorial for a very specific  
01:14 - app you should learn the foundations of IOS app 
development so that you can build any app that's  
01:20 - why I recommend following a structured learning 
path such as a course or a book and hopefully  
01:25 - the material is laid out in a way that builds 
momentum and layers the skill development this  
01:30 - is one of the core philosophies that I took when 
and I designed our beginner course iOS foundations  
01:35 - here at code with Chris the second thing I'd make 
sure to do is to practice while I'm learning now I  
01:41 - know this sounds like standard advice but this is 
what caused me to fail at learning iOS the first  
01:45 - time you see because I have been programming for 
so long I thought that I could read an iOS book  
01:50 - cover to cover without practicing anything and 
you know what I was breezing through the book I  
01:55 - understood everything so it gave me a false 
sense of security when I put that book down  
02:00 - and tried to build the app I didn't know where 
to start that's why I recommend that as you're  
02:06 - learning you need to be practicing that material 
on the computer for yourself now doing that does  
02:11 - two things number one is retention but number 
two more importantly is that it reveals what  
02:16 - you don't know and that means you can address it 
right away trust me don't save the practice until  
02:22 - the very end the third thing I do is to find 
a support network you see as long as you don't  
02:27 - give up you will eventually reach your goal and 
one way to make it harder to give up is to find  
02:33 - a place where you can meet other people who are 
on the same Journey as you or people who might be  
02:37 - able to help you on your journey for example these 
could be local meetups use meetup.com or something  
02:43 - like that or it could be online communities and 
forums sometimes you just need to vent a bit you  
02:48 - might need a pat on the back some encouragement 
or you might need help with a particular problem  
02:54 - having a support network will help with all of 
those things and improve your chances of reaching  
02:59 - your goal okay and the last thing I do is to make 
sure that I have my head on straight and I save  
03:04 - this for last because I know some of you are going 
to call BS but in all of my years of teaching this  
03:09 - stuff I've found that not quitting and sticking 
with it is more than half the battle so if you  
03:15 - can keep the following two things in mind it's 
going to increase your chances greatly number one  
03:20 - is to focus on your progress rather than focus on 
the goal perhaps you have an app that you want to  
03:26 - build if you keep focusing on that goal you might 
keep thinking about how far away you are from  
03:31 - that goal you might start to question the stuff 
you're learning how does it apply to that goal  
03:35 - and that is going to create impatience and also 
dissatisfaction and both of those things are going  
03:43 - to make it more likely that you'll quit instead 
if you focus on the progress that you've made from  
03:49 - the previous week you're going to be a lot more 
happy because you can see yourself improving and  
03:54 - making progress and thinking about that you know 
you're going to eventually reach the ability to  
03:59 - build that app the second thing to keep in mind is 
that frustration is normal you're learning a very  
04:05 - valuable skill that can change your life you're 
going to hit frustration you're going to have bugs  
04:09 - in your code sometimes xcode is going to be buggy 
itself but that's why joining a community and  
04:15 - having that support network is such a vital part 
of the journey so if I were starting out learning  
04:20 - iOS today I would make sure to find a structured 
learning path I would make sure to practice as I  
04:26 - was learning I would make sure to find a community 
that I could be part of and I would also keep in  
04:32 - mind to focus on my progress and Improvement week 
over week if you're interested in a program that  
04:38 - incorporates all of these things check out the 
14 day beginner challenge right over here it's  
04:43 - on YouTube and it's completely free alright 
thanks for watching and I'll see you there
