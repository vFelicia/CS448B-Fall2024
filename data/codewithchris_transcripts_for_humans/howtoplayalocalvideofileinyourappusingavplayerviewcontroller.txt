00:03 - hey coders what's up hope you're having
00:06 - a great Friday in yesterday's lesson we
00:09 - had created a demo where you could play
00:11 - a movie stream in your app so let me
00:13 - demonstrate here that's how that worked
00:17 - well in today's lesson I'm going to show
00:18 - you a variation where instead of loading
00:21 - a URL or loading a stream off the net
00:23 - we're going to include the video file
00:25 - into our Xcode project and play it from
00:27 - there so if you missed yesterday's video
00:30 - just look in the upper right corner here
00:32 - and you can click that to open up that
00:34 - video in a new window and it might be
00:36 - pretty helpful for you to watch that
00:37 - because I'm going to be just modifying
00:40 - that demo to do today's local video
00:42 - version I've actually downloaded that
00:44 - video onto my desktop it's called small
00:46 - mp4 and you can see it right here and
00:49 - all I'm gonna do is just drag it into
00:52 - Xcode and just I'm going to put it there
00:55 - so you might have a couple of checkboxes
00:57 - so for you this might be unchecked it
00:59 - says copy items of needed and what this
01:01 - does is if you have this checked it's
01:03 - going to make a copy of that
01:05 - mp4 into your project folder if you
01:08 - leave it unchecked your Xcode project is
01:10 - just going to reference that video file
01:12 - wherever it may be so for me it's on the
01:15 - desktop this may be a problem if I move
01:18 - the project let's say I send the project
01:19 - to someone and I forget to include the
01:21 - movie file on the desktop so usually
01:23 - what I do is I enable that copy items if
01:26 - needed the second thing you want to make
01:28 - sure is it says add two targets and then
01:30 - here it lists the a/v player demo which
01:33 - is our demo app here so we want to make
01:36 - sure that that's checked because that is
01:38 - going to include that movie file into
01:42 - the bundle or the app package in other
01:44 - words so I'm going to click finish let's
01:47 - review the code that we have here in the
01:49 - viewdidload so we added the a/v
01:52 - foundation and a/v kit frameworks to the
01:54 - project here in the project properties
01:57 - if I scroll down and then in the view
01:59 - controller we actually imported them so
02:01 - that we could use the classes in this
02:03 - class and then we created a new AV
02:06 - player view controller object we
02:08 - declared an AV player property but it's
02:11 - unassigned right now and
02:12 - in the viewdidload what we did was we
02:15 - created an nsurl object off of this URL
02:18 - or this string right here and then we
02:20 - got a check if that nsurl object
02:23 - actually exists because this initializer
02:26 - may potentially return a nil object if
02:29 - it couldn't create that nsurl object so
02:32 - here inside this if statement we
02:34 - determine that indeed it there is an
02:36 - object and then we create an AV player
02:39 - object from that URL initializing it
02:41 - with that URL I mean and then we assign
02:45 - it into that property we created and
02:46 - then finally we assign that AV player
02:49 - object into the player property of the
02:52 - AV player view controller in the
02:54 - storyboard we have a play button here
02:57 - and when that is tapped what happens is
03:01 - this code gets executed it presents the
03:03 - AV player view controller and then when
03:07 - it's finished presenting on the screen
03:08 - it calls the play method of the player
03:11 - so in order to play this movie file that
03:14 - we added into our Xcode project instead
03:17 - of this URL all we have to do is first
03:20 - create a string path to this file in our
03:24 - project and then we need to pass that
03:26 - path into an nsurl object and then the
03:30 - rest is the same so let's do that now
03:32 - let your L path string equals so what we
03:39 - want to do remember I mentioned the
03:40 - bundle before and it's basically when
03:43 - you compile your app you get an app
03:45 - bundle which is the package that gets
03:47 - deployed on the app and right now we're
03:51 - accessing the main bundle dot path for
03:54 - resource and here we're just going to
03:57 - get the path to that small dot mp4 file
04:00 - notice that it returns an optional type
04:03 - string okay so what we're passing in
04:06 - here is the name of the resource which
04:08 - is small and the type is mp4 so because
04:14 - this returns an optional string object
04:16 - I'm just going to put that as the type
04:19 - of the constant here so we don't forget
04:21 - and before we proceed we should check if
04:24 - that URL path string
04:26 - actually exists so if let your L path
04:30 - equals URL path string and then we only
04:34 - want to continue to do all of this stuff
04:36 - if that string was actually valid
04:39 - so in here let's say let movie URL
04:43 - equals nsurl and instead of string which
04:49 - we used before we're going to use file
04:51 - URL with path and we're going to pass in
04:54 - this string up here which points to the
04:56 - movie file in our bundle and notice that
04:59 - this one returns an NS yo object whereas
05:02 - the one we used in the previous lesson
05:04 - where we pass in this that returns an
05:07 - optional NS URL type okay so file URL
05:12 - with path and then we pass in URL path
05:16 - right so this line is what we're doing
05:20 - instead of this line here so I'm just
05:22 - going to delete that and because this
05:24 - guy returns an nsurl object we no longer
05:27 - have to use this optional binding to
05:29 - check if there's actually an object in
05:32 - there so I'm just going to copy these
05:33 - two lines of code I'm going to delete
05:36 - this if statement and then move that
05:38 - down here so instead of passing in URL
05:41 - we're going to pass in this movie URL
05:42 - okay and we're pretty much done like
05:45 - that so let's review what we've done
05:47 - here first of all because we've included
05:49 - that movie file into our app bundle we
05:52 - need to get a path to it so we call path
05:55 - for resource on the main bundle and we
05:57 - pass in what the name of the resource is
05:59 - and that returns a string representing
06:02 - the path to that resource that string
06:05 - may be optional maybe nil if it can't
06:07 - find it so that's why we have to use
06:09 - this optional binding statement to check
06:12 - if it found the path and if it did we're
06:15 - going to create an nsurl
06:16 - object off of that path and then we're
06:19 - going to pass in that nsurl object to
06:21 - create our AV player and then finally
06:24 - we're passing that AV player object into
06:26 - the player property of the AV player
06:29 - view controller and that's what gets
06:31 - presented to the user so now let's run
06:34 - it and see it in action so play and
06:37 - there we go now this file is playing
06:40 - of the local Xcode project so it won't
06:44 - have to download any files or anything
06:45 - like that and the user will still be
06:47 - able to watch that video even with no
06:49 - internet connection so I hope that was
06:51 - helpful for you guys please subscribe
06:54 - like and share the video if you enjoyed
06:55 - it and have a great weekend I'll see you
06:58 - guys on Monday

well in today's lesson I'm going to show you a variation where instead of loading a URL or loading a stream off the net we're going to include the video file into our Xcode project and play it from
