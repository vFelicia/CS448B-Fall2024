With timestamps:

00:00 - Hi.
My name is Stewart Lynch,
00:01 - and this is the 6th and final video
in the iOS with concurrency series.
00:07 - In this video we're going to see if we can
apply the new iOS asynchronous concurrency
00:11 - methods to an Xcode project
with a target of iOS iOS 14.
00:17 - This will require Xcode 13 two or later,
and it wasn't until Xcode 13 two
00:22 - that Apple backported some of these
features to targets of iOS 13 or earlier.
00:29 - If you're just jumping into the start
00:31 - of this series,
you can download the completed code
00:33 - from the fifth video in this series
from the link in the description below
00:40 - with Xcode 13.
00:41 - Two, some of the new concurrency features
have been backported to iOS 13,
00:45 - and this is great news because perhaps we
realized that by setting our target to iOS
00:50 - 15 only, we're missing out on a lot of
users who have not upgraded their phones.
00:56 - We're currently using some iOS 15 specific
APIs that will no longer be able to use.
01:02 - But I would really like to use this
new asynchronous concurrency model
01:07 - as we're testing again,
let's create a new branch by now.
01:10 - This should be familiar to you.
01:12 - Select the source Xcode Navigator and then
01:16 - right click on the main
branch to check it out.
01:22 - Notice that it is now the active branch
01:25 - and we're going to branch
off of this one right here.
01:28 - So we'll right click and create a new
branch and I'll call it back Port.
01:36 - This time it created the branch and it
checked it out all at the same time.
01:41 - So now it's my current active
branch that I can work on.
01:47 - Now, this get JSON function in our API
01:50 - service is the completion handler version
of our function,
01:53 - and it doesn't use the new async and await
concurrency methods that were introduced
01:57 - in iOS 15 in videos four
and five of this series.
02:01 - We changed that to use these new methods.
02:05 - Now, if you've updated your Xcode
02:06 - to version 13 two, you should now be able
to take advantage of those new features
02:11 - and projects for targeting
earlier versions of iOS.
02:16 - And this is one of the terms target
02:18 - applies to switch the application
and you'll see both project and target
02:24 - the target, in a sense, means which of
the Apple SDKs am I developing for?
02:29 - Is it macOS iOS iPadOS?
02:33 - Is it a Widget Kit application
or one of many others?
02:38 - If you click on the target and then
on the general tab, there is a deployment
02:43 - info section, and here you get to see
what the iOS deployment target is.
02:49 - And in my case here
it's set to iOS 15 two.
02:54 - This means that in order to install
02:56 - and run this application on your device,
it has to be running iOS version 15 two or
03:01 - higher, and those who haven't upgraded
yet can't run your application.
03:06 - As I said, you potentially may be
losing out on a lot of customers.
03:11 - In most cases, the Swift UI going back
to iOS 14 from iOS 15 requires only minor
03:18 - changes depending on what APIs you've
implemented, and we'll see that shortly.
03:23 - Going back to iOS 13 is a little bit more
03:25 - problematic because there are more
deprecated methods,
03:29 - so I'm going to take the less troublesome
path and change my target back to iOS 14
03:35 - and see what happens and what's
going to be required.
03:42 - When we build, we get several errors,
and these errors are all saying
03:47 - that a particular API that we're using
is only available in iOS 15 and newer.
03:56 - The overlay and alert APIs we use in our
03:59 - code have changed since I was 14,
so we're going to have to revert back
04:04 - to the deprecated versions
that were available to us.
04:07 - Then it's important to note
04:09 - that Deprecated doesn't mean
that we are playing with Fire.
04:12 - There are many Deprecated API that have
04:15 - been around for many, many years, so
there's no need to panic at some point.
04:19 - However, in the future, though,
when you change your target back to iOS 15
04:23 - or higher, you should change the code
again to remove the deprecated versions.
04:29 - If I click on one of the overlay errors,
it takes us to that culprit.
04:35 - If you option click in the overlay error
in users list view, we get the quick help
04:40 - and if we scroll down further,
we see opening documentation.
04:46 - So let's do that and we see
that it's available from iOS 15 on.
04:54 - I know that there's an iOS 14 version,
however, because I used it
05:00 - and it doesn't put our view
into this trailing closure.
05:03 - Rather Overlay didn't use a closure
at all, so let's remove it.
05:10 - Now.
The error here is hard to decipher,
05:12 - but if we enclose our clause here
in a group, the error goes away.
05:21 - We can repeat that in the postlist
view too, so we'll do the same thing.
05:25 - We'll remove the closure
and embed it within a group.
05:33 - Let's check out the alert and option click
05:36 - and then drill down
into the documentation.
05:42 - I can see that it too is iOS 15 on.
05:44 - Onlynow.
05:47 - If I search through the documentation
05:50 - and click on the alert that's found.
05:52 - I'm taken to another alert and I see
05:54 - that it's been available since iOS 13,
but that it's been deprecated.
06:01 - It may take several releases for it
to actually disappear,
06:04 - and by that time hopefully you've updated
your code to use the more modern APIs.
06:11 - We can see that this documentation is
06:14 - within a section called
Deprecated Views and Controls.
06:18 - Scrolling down.
06:19 - We can see the different initializers
that were available to us.
06:26 - If we remove this code now
we can start typing alert,
06:31 - and if we take a look at the options,
we can scroll down and we'll see the two
06:35 - earlier versions and they
are marked in Gray.
06:39 - That's an indication that they're
deprecated or not available to us.
06:43 - However, we can make them available to us.
06:46 - Let's choose the is presented version
06:50 - and it needs to be bound to something
which is our viewmodels shower alert
06:57 - inside the ContentView closure.
06:59 - We'll need to use what is
known as an alert object,
07:03 - and there are a number of options here.
07:06 - The one we want is the one with title
07:08 - message, both being text views
and an optional dismiss button
07:17 - for the title.
07:17 - We can use a text view and we'll
just say application error
07:24 - for the message.
07:25 - We can use another text view
with our view model's error message,
07:31 - but it's optional, so we'll not
coalesce it with an empty string,
07:37 - and we don't need the dismiss button
07:39 - because as I mentioned, it's optional,
so we can just remove it.
07:44 - We can repeat this process for the user's
07:47 - list view, and I happen to know
that the ad alert is exactly the same,
07:51 - so we'll just copy it here and paste it
or replace it with the same version.
07:58 - If we build now, there are no errors.
08:01 - Great, but we really
haven't gained anything.
08:05 - What you have now is a project that you
08:07 - could have originally Xcode
using Xcode Twelve under iOS 14.
08:13 - If you want to go back to iOS 13,
08:15 - you'd have to do more things like changing
the navigation title to a navigation bar
08:20 - title you couldn't use State object,
and there's probably a host of others,
08:25 - so I'm going to stop here, but you can
go back as far as iOS 13 with Swift UI,
08:32 - the observer of you will notice
that the list style is not complaining
08:35 - about my using Plane instead of using
the full instance of Plane liststyle
08:41 - struct that we had to do in Xcode twelve,
and it appears that the new style options
08:46 - have been backported, so we don't
need to do anything to change them.
08:53 - Well, with Xcode 13 two,
we learned that the new concurrency
08:56 - methods have been backboarded
as far back as iOS 13.
09:01 - So if we want to update your API fetches
to use this new Asynchronous version
09:05 - of the URL session data method,
we're going to have to implement those new
09:11 - features, and this should
greatly clean up our code.
09:16 - Well, it turns out that although Swift
five five's new concurrency system is
09:20 - becoming backward
compatible in exclude 13.
09:23 - Two, some of the built in APIs that make
09:26 - use of these concurrency features are
still only available on iOS 15,
09:31 - Mac OS Monterey and the rest
of Apple's 2021 operating systems.
09:38 - The good news, however,
is that we are provided with another
09:41 - method that we haven't looked at yet,
and it's a continuation mechanism
09:45 - that lets us retrofit existing
code with Async await support.
09:51 - And what also is good news is that Xcode
gives us some assistance here.
09:57 - If you Xcode and click on the function
09:59 - name for our existing completion handler
version of Get JSON,
10:03 - you get three different options
for converting this function
10:06 - to an Asynchronous version,
and all three will work.
10:10 - But we really would like to understand
10:12 - this, so I can Xcode in the future
from the Get go,
10:16 - so let's explore the options
and we'll start from the bottom up.
10:20 - If I choose this method,
10:22 - it simply creates a new function that has
the same first two parameters,
10:26 - but instead of a completion handler,
it's an asynchronous throwing function
10:31 - just like our new one that we
created in videos four and five.
10:36 - No error, then calling the new function
10:38 - yet JSON because as we saw in video four,
we can have two functions with the same
10:44 - name so long as the function
parameters are different.
10:47 - What this does use is the with check
10:50 - throwing continuation that calls our old
completion handler function and then
10:56 - essentially maps the continuation
into an Asynchronous one.
11:00 - That's pretty cool,
11:01 - but now I have two functions to clutter
my code, and our View models are still
11:06 - calling the older version with the
completion handler and not this version.
11:11 - So let's just undo this and take
a look at our second one.
11:17 - If we choose this one,
11:18 - it basically does the same thing as we saw
in the previous example,
11:22 - but it makes all of the same changes
in line in the Asynchronous version of our
11:28 - function with the use of the checked
throwing continuation block and adds
11:34 - continuation resume for each
of the result enum cases.
11:40 - Now the errors we're getting here are all
related to the function now not
11:43 - recognizing the API error case,
since it's not specified in our function
11:48 - parameters,
and we can fix that by pretending all
11:52 - of the cases with API error
and by removing any unnecessary returns.
12:09 - Still, I have two functions to deal with,
and our View models are still calling this
12:13 - older version with the completion
handler and not this version.
12:17 - So let's undo once more.
12:22 - Let's go all in now then and convert our
12:24 - function completely so that we only
have a single function to deal with.
12:28 - And that's what this first
option will do for us.
12:35 - Well, we'll need to fix those return
in errors for not knowing what type
12:39 - of error is still just like
we did in the last version.
12:46 - The errors in this file all go away now,
but when I build, I get four errors.
12:51 - Why is that?
12:53 - Well, it's because now I'm trying to call
12:55 - that old completion handler version that
we had before and it's no longer here.
13:01 - So let's fix that and this will be
a repeat of what we basically did in video
13:06 - four when we created the Async
function from scratch in iOS 15
13:13 - in users.
Chris view model.
13:14 - Then let's remove from the fetch users
13:17 - function everything except the first two
lines because we are going to need
13:21 - an instance of the API service and we
want to set is Loading to true.
13:28 - But remember, we can now use the defer
block right within our function.
13:32 - So after is Loading toggle
we'll add the defer block.
13:40 - Then we can simply create a do catch
block, and then within the do block,
13:45 - we can try and await the return
from the API service.
13:49 - Get JSON function
and assign it to our users
13:54 - and we can fix the error because we need
13:56 - to specify that our function getJSON
is now an asynchronous function
14:04 - in the catch block.
14:05 - We can set show error to true
14:11 - and then set our error message
14:13 - with the errors localized description
and that contact information,
14:26 - and then we have to decorate the function
with App main actor to ensure
14:30 - that the function is dispatched
back on the main queue,
14:38 - or we can copy everything
from defer on down here
14:43 - and then go to the post list ViewModel
14:46 - and replace the corresponding part of the
getpost function with the same content
14:52 - updating.
14:53 - Of course, users to posts specifying that
the fetch post function is asynchronous
15:02 - and adding the app main actor to make sure
that we get executed on the main thread.
15:07 - Again,
15:11 - we have a couple of errors left,
though, and those are in our views,
15:17 - and that's because on up here we're
trying to call an asynchronous function.
15:25 - Well, we can't use task
as we did in iOS 15.
15:29 - It's one of those things
that didn't get backported.
15:32 - However, you may recall
that there's another option.
15:36 - We can use a unit of Asynchronous work
called a task so we can embed within
15:42 - the on a peer our content inside a task
and await the fetching of the JSON.
15:53 - Finally, then we can go to the post list
15:55 - view and do exactly the same
thing for on appear.
16:00 - We can enclose our actions
in an asynchronous task
16:05 - and then await the fetching of the posts
16:09 - we can build and run now
16:13 - and all errors will disappear
and our application runs.
16:27 - We have successfully backported our
16:30 - application to run under iOS 14
using the new Asynchronous methods.
16:37 - Before we ship the app, though,
16:38 - make sure that you'll check any warning
the app is giving you like this one here
16:43 - that we left for ourselves to make sure
that the four previews is set to false.
16:49 - Now, the last thing I'm going to do is
16:52 - commit any changes to our
local Git repository.
17:01 - Well, that's it.
17:03 - Thanks for joining me on this six part
17:04 - journey, and I hope that you've learned
some useful and transferable skills.
17:09 - I want to thank Chris for inviting me
to add content to his channel,
17:13 - and I look forward to being able
to contribute more in the future.
17:16 - Thanks for watching.

Hi. My name is Stewart Lynch, and this is the 6th and final video in the iOS with concurrency series. In this video we're going to see if we can apply the new iOS asynchronous concurrency methods to an Xcode project with a target of iOS iOS 14. This will require Xcode 13 two or later, and it wasn't until Xcode 13 two that Apple backported some of these features to targets of iOS 13 or earlier. If you're just jumping into the start of this series, you can download the completed code from the fifth video in this series from the link in the description below with Xcode 13. Two, some of the new concurrency features have been backported to iOS 13, and this is great news because perhaps we realized that by setting our target to iOS 15 only, we're missing out on a lot of users who have not upgraded their phones. We're currently using some iOS 15 specific APIs that will no longer be able to use. But I would really like to use this new asynchronous concurrency model as we're testing again, let's create a new branch by now. This should be familiar to you. Select the source Xcode Navigator and then right click on the main branch to check it out. Notice that it is now the active branch and we're going to branch off of this one right here. So we'll right click and create a new branch and I'll call it back Port. This time it created the branch and it checked it out all at the same time. So now it's my current active branch that I can work on. Now, this get JSON function in our API service is the completion handler version of our function, and it doesn't use the new async and await concurrency methods that were introduced in iOS 15 in videos four and five of this series. We changed that to use these new methods. Now, if you've updated your Xcode to version 13 two, you should now be able to take advantage of those new features and projects for targeting earlier versions of iOS. And this is one of the terms target applies to switch the application and you'll see both project and target the target, in a sense, means which of the Apple SDKs am I developing for? Is it macOS iOS iPadOS? Is it a Widget Kit application or one of many others? If you click on the target and then on the general tab, there is a deployment info section, and here you get to see what the iOS deployment target is. And in my case here it's set to iOS 15 two. This means that in order to install and run this application on your device, it has to be running iOS version 15 two or higher, and those who haven't upgraded yet can't run your application. As I said, you potentially may be losing out on a lot of customers. In most cases, the Swift UI going back to iOS 14 from iOS 15 requires only minor changes depending on what APIs you've implemented, and we'll see that shortly. Going back to iOS 13 is a little bit more problematic because there are more deprecated methods, so I'm going to take the less troublesome path and change my target back to iOS 14 and see what happens and what's going to be required. When we build, we get several errors, and these errors are all saying that a particular API that we're using is only available in iOS 15 and newer. The overlay and alert APIs we use in our code have changed since I was 14, so we're going to have to revert back to the deprecated versions that were available to us. Then it's important to note that Deprecated doesn't mean that we are playing with Fire. There are many Deprecated API that have been around for many, many years, so there's no need to panic at some point. However, in the future, though, when you change your target back to iOS 15 or higher, you should change the code again to remove the deprecated versions. If I click on one of the overlay errors, it takes us to that culprit.

So let's do that and we see that it's available from iOS 15 on. I know that there's an iOS 14 version, however, because I used it and it doesn't put our view into this trailing closure.

If we remove this code now we can start typing alert, and if we take a look at the options, we can scroll down and we'll see the two earlier versions and they are marked in Gray. That's an indication that they're deprecated or not available to us. However, we can make them available to us. Let's choose the is presented version and it needs to be bound to something which is our viewmodels shower alert inside the ContentView closure. We'll need to use what is known as an alert object, and there are a number of options here.

Again, we have a couple of errors left, though, and those are in our views, and that's because on up here we're trying to call an asynchronous function. Well, we can't use task as we did in iOS 15. It's one of those things that didn't get backported. However, you may recall that there's another option. We can use a unit of Asynchronous work called a task so we can embed within the on a peer our content inside a task and await the fetching of the JSON. Finally, then we can go to the post list view and do exactly the same thing for on appear. We can enclose our actions in an asynchronous task and then await the fetching of the posts we can build and run now and all errors will disappear and our application runs. We have successfully backported our application to run under iOS 14 using the new Asynchronous methods. Before we ship the app, though, make sure that you'll check any warning the app is giving you like this one here that we left for ourselves to make sure that the four previews is set to false. Now, the last thing I'm going to do is commit any changes to our local Git repository. Well, that's it. Thanks for joining me on this six part journey, and I hope that you've learned some useful and transferable skills. I want to thank Chris for inviting me to add content to his channel, and I look forward to being able to contribute more in the future. Thanks for watching.
