00:00 - hey code crew it's chris here it's been a long 
time since i've recorded a video like this  
00:05 - but we've recently crossed the 500 000 subscriber 
mark and i want to thank you for all of the  
00:11 - support that you've shown us for the eight 
or nine years that we've been on youtube it's  
00:15 - really really incredible i couldn't have imagined 
that we'd get to this point today you know it all  
00:21 - started like this just making videos now in recent 
months i hope you've learned a lot from our guest  
00:28 - trainers over the years i've been so fortunate to 
make friends and i'm so happy that they were all  
00:34 - willing to lend a helping hand stuart flo michaela 
jc and all of the other trainers that have  
00:40 - appeared on our channel i respect you guys so much 
and thank you so much for appearing on the channel  
00:46 - now if you guys want to see more from them i'll 
put the links to their channels in the description  
00:51 - below i hope you learned a thing or two from them 
so the question is while they were teaching where  
00:56 - was i and what was i doing well i was working 
behind the scenes doing things like business  
01:01 - development content planning trying to set up 
partnerships and in general just trying to grow  
01:06 - the business and the truth is i don't really know 
what i'm doing i'm just learning things as i go  
01:12 - along i didn't go to school for business so just 
trying a whole bunch of different things and over  
01:17 - the past eight or nine years this is how code with 
chris grew i would try a lot of things uh you know  
01:24 - 99 of it wouldn't work but sometimes every now and 
then one thing would really hit and it would help  
01:30 - grow code with chris just a little bit and um over 
the years that that little incremental progress  
01:37 - got us to where we are today now i'm happy to 
say that despite just shooting in the dark like  
01:42 - this we have done better each year compared to the 
previous year except for some of those early years  
01:48 - but um all of this growth over the last eight or 
nine years have been thanks to you so thank you so  
01:54 - much for all of the support that you've shown 
us so at this point we've grown a team to run  
02:01 - the day-to-day code with chris engine and really 
the last thing for me to do is to remove myself  
02:08 - from the training role and that way i can focus 
100 on steering the ship but before i tell you  
02:15 - what i've decided to do let me give you some 
background information and some context you see  
02:21 - spending all of this time learning business and 
marketing has really taken me away from the code  
02:28 - and i still think i can do a pretty stand-up 
job of teaching the fundamentals of ios  
02:32 - app development or else i don't 
think that we would still be here  
02:36 - however if you put me into a room of full-time 
ios developers well i don't think i would feel  
02:42 - very comfortable the sad thing is when i 
think about that it actually it makes me sad  
02:49 - because i really like coding it's just that 
i haven't done it for quite a while at least  
02:55 - at a full-time capacity or you know at a capacity 
where i can feel confidently calling myself an ios  
03:03 - developer now feeling the way that i do there are 
two very specific memories that come up for me one  
03:08 - of them is when i was an intern at a consulting 
company and my supervisor was a software architect  
03:16 - but i was pretty much a powerpoint monkey uh 
preparing decks and sometimes ordering catering  
03:22 - for their exact meetings i know that's a weird 
combination of duties right but anyways there was  
03:27 - one specific time that's really clear in my head 
he said one of the things that he misses the most  
03:34 - is just sitting down and coding because he 
can't do that anymore as a software architect  
03:39 - i guess he spends a lot of times designing 
systems and software instead and then the team  
03:44 - goes and builds the software the second memory 
is when i graduated and started working full  
03:49 - time and at that full-time job again my mentor 
was a lead architect i know lucky me right  
03:57 - but he told me again one of the things that he 
misses the most is being able to put on a pair of  
04:03 - headphones sit down and code and have nobody bug 
him or look for him and you know what i can really  
04:09 - relate to that because when you're in the zone 
and you're coding that's some of the best time  
04:14 - like time just flies and you're having you you end 
up having a lot of fun and one more bonus example  
04:21 - just to hammer the point home my friend works 
at google and he's been working there since 2007  
04:27 - when we graduated together and he tells me that 
these days he doesn't touch code anymore he's just  
04:34 - managing teams and he's doing important stuff that 
doesn't involve coding so all of these examples  
04:42 - basically say that in order to move up in 
your career or to grow you end up moving  
04:49 - away from the code all right so it feels 
very natural for me for code with chris  
04:54 - for me to start moving away from the code as i 
have and now to the point where maybe i will i am  
05:01 - you know pretty much removed from it to be 
honest it doesn't feel right i really had to  
05:06 - stop and think about it and try to put my finger 
on why i was feeling this way so i started asking  
05:11 - myself questions like why do i want to grow 
the business what would it feel like to have  
05:18 - you know a ton of people working here would i be 
really stressed out would i feel eager to wake up  
05:25 - every morning or would i dread it and that led 
me to i think the the bottom line like the most  
05:32 - important question is what do i want to spend my 
day doing like what do i enjoy doing i think the  
05:37 - answer is clear it's coding it's sharing my 
knowledge it's interacting with you guys you  
05:43 - know those very elements that came together 
to form this youtube channel nine years ago  
05:49 - and i'm so fortunate you know i recognize 
that that i can be in a position to make this  
05:56 - decision that you know i want to spend my days 
doing this and this can be my full-time job and i  
06:03 - totally recognize that and i'm so thankful for you 
guys for your support that allows me to do this  
06:11 - because not only are you supporting me and making 
this a full-time job for me but also you're  
06:18 - supporting a team now because we have a bunch 
of people working together to you know produce  
06:24 - the content and release it and do the social media 
and newsletter and all of those different aspects  
06:29 - so really on behalf of the entire team you 
have our sincere gratitude and appreciation  
06:35 - so really this video was to thank you guys for 
your support for 500 000 subscribers this huge  
06:42 - milestone for our youtube channel and for the 
business and also to tell you that it um it gave  
06:48 - me pause and gave me a chance to reflect on you 
know how the business has grown and what do i want  
06:54 - to optimize for right and i want to optimize 
for day-to-day fulfillment rather than trying  
07:00 - to grow the business for the sake of growing 
the business so thank you for giving me that  
07:04 - moment right um and thank you for listening to 
me ramble and i'll see you guys in the next video
07:42 - you
