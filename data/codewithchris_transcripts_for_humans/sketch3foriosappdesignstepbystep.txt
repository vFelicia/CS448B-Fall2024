00:06 - hey YouTubers welcome to this video
00:09 - where I'm going to show you how to use
00:11 - sketch 3 to design the UI for an app and
00:14 - this video was actually released in the
00:17 - course uh we're building a sort of like
00:20 - a quiz type app and so this lesson was a
00:23 - course lesson uh that showed how to
00:26 - design the UI using sketch and so I just
00:29 - adapt it for YouTube and I'm going to
00:31 - show you guys the first part of at least
00:34 - designing the first two screens and yeah
00:36 - hope you guys can get uh a feel for
00:41 - sketch hey guys so in this video we're
00:44 - going to talk about the redesign of the
00:47 - objectiv C trainer app this time done
00:50 - with Sketch sketch three to be exact and
00:54 - I think in general it's a a major
00:56 - improvement from the old design I feel
00:59 - like this one is in general more
01:02 - pleasing to the eye and more
01:04 - exciting and we can definitely play with
01:06 - the gradients in the background which
01:08 - changes the whole look and feel of the
01:09 - screen so let's go through some of the
01:11 - screens and how it's changed this is the
01:14 - question screen specifically for a
01:16 - multiple choice question and as you can
01:18 - see here are the three
01:20 - choices and when you select one the two
01:24 - uh the
01:25 - two wrong answers fade away and the
01:28 - right one kind of slides
01:31 - up here's what a fill-in the blank
01:33 - question would look like you just have a
01:35 - text box and uh a go
01:41 - button and here's what uh find the error
01:45 - question would look like and after you
01:48 - tap on the image uh the screen would dim
01:50 - and it would highlight where you were
01:52 - supposed to
01:56 - tap and here's what the menu would look
01:59 - like and this
02:00 - is probably where a lot of uh a lot of
02:03 - it differs from the old design because
02:05 - instead of having a separate stats
02:07 - screen I decided to incorporate it into
02:09 - the menu so there are three categories
02:11 - of questions easy medium and hard so I
02:14 - decided to incorporate this cell kind of
02:17 - like as a progress bar indicating how
02:20 - much you got right versus how much
02:22 - attempts you made at in that category so
02:25 - this kind of serves as a stats screen so
02:29 - we don't need a separate one the reset
02:32 - button is to reset the stats uh we still
02:35 - have the remove ads screen which you can
02:38 - see right beside it here it's just going
02:40 - to dim the whole screen and have these
02:42 - two buttons and then instead of an about
02:44 - screen which I also had in the old app I
02:48 - will have a button saying visit
02:50 - website which will bring the user to a
02:53 - web page on my site telling people about
02:56 - the
02:57 - app so I feel like in this way I've
03:00 - simplified the app a lot more uh and
03:04 - kind of removed a lot of sections so it
03:06 - doesn't feel as
03:08 - heavy so in this video I'm going to show
03:10 - you how I put together this design in
03:15 - sketch okay so to start sketch is kind
03:19 - of made for iOS design almost because if
03:23 - you create uh a new file from a template
03:26 - you have these options so I selected iOS
03:29 - UI Des
03:30 - design and it starts you off with uh
03:34 - this screen right here which you can
03:36 - kind of get rid of you don't need this
03:40 - stuff so what I did was I basically just
03:44 - deleted that I chose delete the
03:47 - layers uh deleted this I deleted all of
03:55 - this okay
03:58 - and
04:01 - I inserted an artboard from this side
04:04 - you can
04:05 - select a portrait and I called
04:11 - this the multiple choice screen it's my
04:14 - first screen I actually set the position
04:16 - to 0
04:18 - 0 you can hold down space bar and your
04:21 - mouse becomes a hand then you can pan
04:24 - around okay so the first thing I did was
04:26 - I I added a background to this guy
04:30 - and you can just select it select it
04:32 - right
04:34 - here I just gave it this light green
04:38 - background uh the second thing I hit R
04:41 - for a rectangle
04:43 - tool and I just drew drew a rectangle to
04:47 - about that and you might need to play
04:49 - with the sizing a little bit because if
04:51 - it doesn't snap into place you go into
04:54 - this part right here change to pos
04:56 - position 0 0 the width is 640
05:00 - and the height you can leave it as is
05:03 - but this is uh where I disabled the
05:07 - border for the fill I went to this
05:10 - gradient right here and I just selected
05:13 - this
05:15 - gradient and then I selected the
05:18 - rectangle again and you can change the
05:20 - opacity either from this control or you
05:22 - can just simply hit one on your keyboard
05:24 - for 10% or two for 20% and so on I think
05:28 - for this one I did about um like a 50 or
05:31 - 60% so let's do a 60%
05:34 - there and then I I added the question I
05:39 - hit t for
05:40 - text and I just added a new piece of
05:43 - text there I Center aligned
05:55 - it so there's my question and what's
05:59 - cool is that you can actually select the
06:01 - element you want hold down alt and you
06:03 - can see you can keep holding it while
06:06 - you move it and you can see how to kind
06:08 - of move it into the
06:11 - middle it's a little fidgety
06:14 - but can even do
06:20 - that oh I must accidentally created
06:23 - another one let me delete the first
06:27 - one all right so that's in the
06:32 - middle okay then I hit R to create
06:34 - another rectangle and this time I wanted
06:37 - to do the questions area so I created
06:40 - another one this time for the whole
06:45 - [Music]
06:47 - thing position I always seem to have to
06:50 - change the position so go zero that's
06:54 - fine but the width is 640 you want to
06:56 - cover the whole
06:58 - thing uh I always get rid of the Border
07:01 - I don't need that I changed the fill
07:04 - I'll change it to something like that
07:07 - and then I was playing a lot with the
07:09 - opacity
07:11 - actually so this one I've got at a like
07:15 - 40%
07:17 - opacity uh and then I created some
07:19 - blocks here kind of like for a status
07:28 - bar
07:44 - okay I changed this one got rid of the
07:47 - Border changed this one to a a dark
07:52 - gray and then I highlight this and if
07:55 - you press command D you can actually
07:57 - just duplicate it and make another copy
08:00 - so that's what I
08:06 - did selected a different color for this
08:11 - guy and then finally I duplicated it
08:15 - again stretched it out and this time
08:19 - chose an even lighter
08:21 - gray uh T put some text
08:25 - here uh I
08:28 - did a bold with
08:36 - size smaller size something like
08:58 - that
09:20 - okay and then at this point I did a
09:24 - rectangle as you can see it's all very
09:28 - boxy kind of eyeballed it
09:41 - here uh for the color I chose a I chose
09:45 - three different shades of green I think
09:47 - I chose a kind of slightly
09:52 - Olive Type green
09:58 - here
10:01 - uh but but then what I did was for this
10:04 - one I made the
10:06 - opacity something like that then I
10:09 - duplicated it so that I have another
10:12 - one and then I made this one
10:19 - thinner like so and this one was at
10:24 - 100% so I think this one was maybe 80
10:28 - wide
10:30 - maybe not that wide maybe
10:33 - 70 right and then I highlighted both of
10:37 - these I hit uh duplicate to move them
10:42 - down and I would select a different
10:44 - color for these
10:58 - guys
11:00 - so I think all I did was actually maybe
11:02 - use this dropper
11:03 - Tool uh and then
11:06 - go down a
11:08 - little that and then for this guy use
11:13 - the dropper
11:14 - tool select
11:22 - that
11:24 - so let's put some text on this
11:28 - guy
11:32 - so I chose light I made it pretty
11:37 - big that it might have been ultra
11:41 - light Maybe not maybe it was just
11:53 - light uh once again command D to
11:57 - duplicate it
12:01 - oops and the layering ordering is off so
12:03 - I'm just going to move this guy up
12:06 - there so the topmost layers are the one
12:09 - that's uh most
12:28 - visible I'm just going to play around
12:30 - with these colors a little
12:51 - bit I was playing around a lot with the
12:58 - opacity
13:07 - uh and
13:08 - then high like these
13:12 - duplicate by pressing command
13:28 - d
13:32 - okay and now I'm going to modify these
13:35 - colors
13:36 - [Music]
13:38 - again slightly
13:44 - lighter duplicate that move it down
13:51 - here now I've got
13:53 - three uh three
13:57 - question for selection now I'm a little
13:59 - bit off in this one because I have so
14:03 - much space left down here you know what
14:05 - I could do I could just select
14:08 - everything by holding down
14:14 - shift and then just slowly drag
14:18 - everything
14:22 - down like that and drag this one down a
14:26 - little
14:28 - bit now I can add some text
14:44 - [Applause]
14:48 - here duplicate
14:50 - that duplicate it
14:52 - [Music]
14:55 - again the duplicate function is actually
14:58 - uh the shortcut key is actually very
15:01 - handy okay and then finally I created a
15:06 - kind of bar down
15:09 - here okay so width is 640 position is
15:15 - zero I got rid of the Border I made this
15:19 - a dark gray but I made
15:21 - it uh like a 20% opacity maybe or maybe
15:27 - 10%
15:29 - and what I did was I hit duplicate
15:32 - command
15:33 - D and
15:36 - I did that add some text there for skip
15:41 - [Music]
15:44 - button I'm so used to pressing V for
15:47 - move from Photoshop but in sketch V
15:50 - turns out to be the vector pen
15:52 - tool okay so that's how I made the
15:54 - multiple choice screen and to do the
15:58 - next screen
15:59 - basically all you do there's this handy
16:02 - command where um you can select the
16:05 - whole the whole kind of
16:07 - artboard and you go to arrange go to
16:10 - make
16:11 - grid and I if I want to duplicate one on
16:15 - the right I would say I want two columns
16:19 - and I want the margin to be 10 pixels
16:23 - and then it would just duplicate this
16:25 - right here uh so then now I can just go
16:28 - ahead and rename it over
16:33 - here right and then what I can do is for
16:38 - the correct answer can delete all of
16:41 - this delete
16:45 - delete because what I want the result to
16:51 - be move this up
16:55 - there and Skip would become next
16:59 - so that's what the result would look
17:02 - like for a multiple choice question okay
17:05 - so that was designing the first two
17:08 - screens of our app using sketch 3 and if
17:11 - you want to watch the rest of the video
17:13 - or more videos like this I highly
17:15 - encourage you to consider joining the
17:17 - course and finding more about it uh you
17:20 - can either click the link in The
17:21 - annotation or in the description so I'll
17:24 - see you guys next time
17:27 - bye
17:36 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey YouTubers welcome to this video where I'm going to show you how to use sketch 3 to design the UI for an app and this video was actually released in the course uh we're building a sort of like a quiz type app and so this lesson was a course lesson uh that showed how to design the UI using sketch and so I just adapt it for YouTube and I'm going to show you guys the first part of at least designing the first two screens and yeah hope you guys can get uh a feel for sketch hey guys so in this video we're going to talk about the redesign of the objectiv C trainer app this time done with Sketch sketch three to be exact and I think in general it's a a major improvement from the old design I feel like this one is in general more pleasing to the eye and more exciting and we can definitely play with the gradients in the background which changes the whole look and feel of the screen so let's go through some of the screens and how it's changed this is the question screen specifically for a multiple choice question and as you can see here are the three choices and when you select one the two uh the two wrong answers fade away and the right one kind of slides up here's what a fillin the blank question would look like you just have a text box and uh a go button and here's what uh find the error question would look like and after you tap on the image uh the screen would dim and it would highlight where you were supposed to tap and here's what the menu would look like and this is probably where a lot of uh a lot of it differs from the old design because instead of having a separate stats screen I decided to incorporate it into the menu so there are three categories of questions easy medium and hard so I decided to incorporate this cell kind of like as a progress bar indicating how much you got right versus how much attempts you made at in that category so this kind of serves as a stats screen so we don't need a separate one the reset button is to reset the stats uh we still have the remove ads screen which you can see right beside it here it's just going to dim the whole screen and have these two buttons and then instead of an about screen which I also had in the old app I will have a button saying visit website which will bring the user to a web page on my site telling people about the app so I feel like in this way I've simplified the app a lot more uh and kind of removed a lot of sections so it doesn't feel as heavy so in this video I'm going to show you how I put together this design in sketch okay so to start sketch is kind of made for iOS design almost because if you create uh a new file from a template you have these options so I selected iOS UI Des design and it starts you off with uh this screen right here which you can kind of get rid of you don't need this stuff so what I did was I basically just deleted that I chose delete the layers uh deleted this I deleted all of this okay and I inserted an artboard from this side you can select a portrait and I called this the multiple choice screen it's my first screen I actually set the position to 0 0 you can hold down space bar and your mouse becomes a hand then you can pan around okay so the first thing I did was I I added a background to this guy and you can just select it select it right here I just gave it this light green background uh the second thing I hit R for a rectangle tool and I just drew drew a rectangle to about that and you might need to play with the sizing a little bit because if it doesn't snap into place you go into this part right here change to pos position 0 0 the width is 640 and the height you can leave it as is but this is uh where I disabled the border for the fill I went to this gradient right here and I just selected this gradient and then I selected the rectangle again and you can change the opacity either from this control or you can just simply hit one on your keyboard for 10% or two for 20% and so on I think for this one I did about um like a 50 or 60% so let's do a 60% there and then I I added the question I hit t for text and I just added a new piece of text there I Center aligned it so there's my question and what's cool is that you can actually select the element you want hold down alt and you can see you can keep holding it while you move it and you can see how to kind of move it into the middle it's a little fidgety but can even do that oh I must accidentally created another one let me delete the first one all right so that's in the middle okay then I hit R to create another rectangle and this time I wanted to do the questions area so I created another one this time for the whole thing position I always seem to have to change the position so go zero that's fine but the width is 640 you want to cover the whole thing uh I always get rid of the Border I don't need that I changed the fill I'll change it to something like that and then I was playing a lot with the opacity actually so this one I've got at a like 40% opacity uh and then I created some blocks here kind of like for a status bar okay I changed this one got rid of the Border changed this one to a a dark gray and then I highlight this and if you press command D you can actually just duplicate it and make another copy so that's what I did selected a different color for this guy and then finally I duplicated it again stretched it out and this time chose an even lighter gray uh T put some text here uh I did a bold with size smaller size something like that okay and then at this point I did a rectangle as you can see it's all very boxy kind of eyeballed it here uh for the color I chose a I chose three different shades of green I think I chose a kind of slightly Olive Type green here uh but but then what I did was for this one I made the opacity something like that then I duplicated it so that I have another one and then I made this one thinner like so and this one was at 100% so I think this one was maybe 80 wide maybe not that wide maybe 70 right and then I highlighted both of these I hit uh duplicate to move them down and I would select a different color for these guys so I think all I did was actually maybe use this dropper Tool uh and then go down a little that and then for this guy use the dropper tool select that so let's put some text on this guy so I chose light I made it pretty big that it might have been ultra light Maybe not maybe it was just light uh once again command D to duplicate it oops and the layering ordering is off so I'm just going to move this guy up there so the topmost layers are the one that's uh most visible I'm just going to play around with these colors a little bit I was playing around a lot with the opacity uh and then high like these duplicate by pressing command d okay and now I'm going to modify these colors again slightly lighter duplicate that move it down here now I've got three uh three question for selection now I'm a little bit off in this one because I have so much space left down here you know what I could do I could just select everything by holding down shift and then just slowly drag everything down like that and drag this one down a little bit now I can add some text here duplicate that duplicate it again the duplicate function is actually uh the shortcut key is actually very handy okay and then finally I created a kind of bar down here okay so width is 640 position is zero I got rid of the Border I made this a dark gray but I made it uh like a 20% opacity maybe or maybe 10% and what I did was I hit duplicate command D and I did that add some text there for skip button I'm so used to pressing V for move from Photoshop but in sketch V turns out to be the vector pen tool okay so that's how I made the multiple choice screen and to do the next screen basically all you do there's this handy command where um you can select the whole the whole kind of artboard and you go to arrange go to make grid and I if I want to duplicate one on the right I would say I want two columns and I want the margin to be 10 pixels and then it would just duplicate this right here uh so then now I can just go ahead and rename it over here right and then what I can do is for the correct answer can delete all of this delete delete because what I want the result to be move this up there and Skip would become next so that's what the result would look like for a multiple choice question okay so that was designing the first two screens of our app using sketch 3 and if you want to watch the rest of the video or more videos like this I highly encourage you to consider joining the course and finding more about it uh you can either click the link in The annotation or in the description so I'll see you guys next time bye
