00:00 - use your existing widget kit knowledge to 
create a lock screen widget for ios 16.  
00:05 - hey cod crew this is flo in this lesson you will 
take your existing knowledge of widget kit and  
00:11 - bring it to one of the biggest io 16 features lock 
screen widgets you will learn about the new size  
00:17 - classes that got introduced and how widgets work 
on the lock screen and just a quick disclaimer  
00:22 - right now i'm using the xcode 14 beta version 
which you can find the download link of right  
00:28 - below this lesson the actual full version of xcode 
14 will be out later this year i would guess that  
00:35 - it will happen about in september until then you 
will have to use the xcode 14 beta because we are  
00:41 - using ios 16 apis so of course we need the ios 16 
sdks as well which are part of the xcode 14 beta i  
00:49 - think you got that point so let's jump right into 
it first of all let's quickly recap how widget kit  
00:55 - works and what you have already learned in this 
course so a widget just like a swift ui app has an  
01:03 - add main annotated struct it's not an app it's 
a widget and in here you have a body of widget  
01:11 - in this case we just have a static configuration 
with our specific view inside which is just  
01:18 - called a widget view this configuration 
always has a name which is just a string  
01:24 - or also called a kind and also a timeline 
provider which is our provider that we had  
01:31 - created so let's look into that next the provider 
is or conforms to the timeline provider protocol  
01:39 - which has to implement three different methods 
the placeholder method for the widget gallery  
01:46 - the get snapshot mesh method and the get 
timeline method we have already implemented  
01:52 - all of these in the previous episodes or 
in the previous lessons of this course so  
01:57 - if you're unsure about how any of this works 
just go back a few lessons and rewatch them
02:05 - the timeline provider basically schedules 
timeline entries for our widget view  
02:11 - so next let's have a quick 
look at our simple entry  
02:16 - so we have a struct called simple entry 
that conforms to the timeline entry protocol  
02:20 - it always has to have a date associated with 
it so it can get scheduled by the system  
02:26 - and then in our case we also pass in some 
to-do's that we got from our to-do api  
02:32 - so let's look at a to-do there's also 
just an identifiable and decodable struct  
02:38 - it has a user id an id to make it identifiable a 
title and a flag whether it's completed yet or not  
02:49 - and now if we go back to our timeline provider you 
will see that we use our to do service dot share  
02:55 - dot get all to do's function that does something 
in the background doesn't really concern us in a  
03:00 - widget here and then we get back to do's and we 
only take the first five of them that means that  
03:07 - when a widget is shown to the screen it always has 
a entry associated with it and that entry always  
03:14 - has five to do's associated with it as well and 
then all of that data is displayed via the widget  
03:22 - view which is just a plain old swift ui view 
it has the timeline entry so we had it here  
03:29 - specified via provider.entry but the actual 
type of this is let me add that as well aka  
03:36 - simple entry so the provider.entry that's 
basically a generic so the entry is a generic  
03:43 - type of the timeline provider which is then 
during population resolved to be a simple entry  
03:51 - um if we have a look at our provider then you will 
see we always return simple entry instead of just  
03:59 - any timeline entry so this is 
basically its associated type  
04:02 - it doesn't really matter right now at all and then 
in addition to the simple entry we also grab the  
04:09 - widget family which is basically the size class 
from the switchoi environment and then display  
04:15 - different views depending on which size class 
this got passed to or is displayed in actually  
04:24 - so right now we only implemented the system medium 
and the system large size class in our widget view  
04:31 - and if we have a look back into our widget and 
you can see we have added the supported families  
04:36 - modifier and passed in the system medium and 
system large size class let's start adding the  
04:43 - lock screen widgets this is actually super simple 
and the only thing that you basically have to do  
04:50 - is to add three new supported families so let's 
get started by just hitting dot and pressing  
04:56 - a and then you will see that there are three new 
accessory families added there is accessory inline  
05:02 - which is the section above the time on the user's 
lock screen there is accessory circular and there  
05:09 - is accessory rectangular which are the small 
and the wider widget sections below the user's  
05:17 - time on their lock screen now xcode is yelling 
at me because let's expand this error here the  
05:24 - new accessory widget families are only available 
in application extensions for ios 16 or newer  
05:30 - and that's because we haven't updated or 
we haven't set the deployment target to ios  
05:35 - 16. it's still at ios 15 so let's jump into our 
xcode project file select our target and for the  
05:43 - ios version let's scroll up to 16.0 and i think 
for the widget we also need to select that yeah  
05:50 - so select the widget extension and then scroll up 
to ios 16.0 and now that error should go away in  
05:57 - a second once xcode decides to re-evaluate it and 
there it goes it's away okay so all you had to do  
06:05 - to support a new widget was adding these three new 
supported families now if you if we jump back into  
06:12 - our widget view you will remember that we switched 
over the widget family and we only had two cases  
06:17 - for the medium and the large size class in any 
other case this default case would be run which is  
06:24 - a text saying not implemented that's of course not 
really nice so let's replace that and add some new  
06:30 - widget ui here so let me clear this up a bit let's 
add the new cases for the new accessory inline  
06:40 - accessory circular and the 
last one accessory rectangular  
06:47 - widget families now as i just said inline is 
the one that's still displayed above the user's  
06:55 - current time on the lock screen and circular 
and rectangular are displayed below the current  
07:00 - time for the inline one i would recommend you 
to only add text and i think that swift ui is  
07:07 - actually smart enough to remove anything from that 
widget that's not text so we will just add a text  
07:15 - of our entry dot to do's and we will grab 
the first one and just display its title  
07:23 - now first here is an optional so we will have 
to optionally unwrap that or a new coil as that  
07:30 - that's what the operator is called and just say 
no to do's if there is no first to do in that list  
07:39 - so that's super simple and then for accessory 
circular and accessory rectangular i will  
07:44 - actually use a new view that was also 
added in swift ui on the iphone at least  
07:49 - with ios 16. i think it already existed on 
the apple watch for complications and that's  
07:54 - the gauge so we will just for the circular we 
will just add a gauge with a value and a label  
08:04 - and as a value we can for example say the number 
of to-do's that were completed divided by the  
08:11 - number of to do's that are not completed yet 
and those five that are um in our timeline entry  
08:17 - you could calculate calculate that um an easy 
way to just try all of this out is to just  
08:23 - set any double value so 0.7 in that case a gauge 
always goes from zero to one so that's basically a  
08:31 - you know like a progress view you can imagine 
it to be like that but we will have a look at it  
08:37 - on the lock screen in just a second anyways so 
let's expand this label closure here and in here  
08:44 - we can just put anything that we want and i will 
just put a text with our entry the date and also  
08:51 - let's format that a bit so let's say that they 
time and we just care for example about the year  
09:00 - and that we will have a gauge displaying 
0.7 and then the label will be the date  
09:06 - of this timeline entry but only the year of 
that date and then for accessory rectangular  
09:13 - let's actually use the exact same thing as 
for accessory circular let's copy paste that  
09:22 - and then let's also add some gourd or gauge 
styling here so there are a few different  
09:29 - gauge styles that we can add and since we're 
currently an accessory circular let's just  
09:34 - use the accessory circular gauge style and then 
also the one for rectangular so accessory linear  
09:45 - in this case okay let's give this a run and have 
a look at how it works on the user's lock screen  
09:53 - okay so the app is now installed on the 
simulator so we can just press command l to  
09:58 - lock the simulator and then press this little 
house icon here again to go back to the lock  
10:03 - screen just press and hold on the lock screen and 
hit customize at the bottom then you will see that  
10:08 - there are three different sections that can be 
customized by the user the top section which has  
10:14 - the accessory inline widgets the center section 
which just has the time the user cannot really  
10:20 - customize this they can only change the font and 
the font color i think and then the bottom section  
10:25 - for accessory circular and accessory rectangular 
so let's start at the top let's press on the first  
10:31 - section and then we can scroll down until we are 
at the widget kit course app and let's select that  
10:38 - widget and then you can see this is probably the 
title of the first dummy to do that we had in our  
10:44 - um yeah that we got from our api service and then 
let's do the same with the bottom section so let's  
10:51 - remove this calendar widget here and then if we 
scroll down to the widget calls we can select it  
10:57 - and the user will be able to see all of the 
available lock screen widgets which in this  
11:00 - case is the accessory circular which is this 
gauge with a value of 0.7 so that's about right  
11:08 - and then as a label it has the current year 
because that's the the text that we added here  
11:16 - so let's select that first and then we also 
have the accessory rectangular and now a very  
11:21 - interesting thing is happening here the gauge 
looks completely different of course because we  
11:25 - gave it a different gauge style but it also 
does not show its label so you'll have to  
11:30 - keep that in mind when you're using the gauge view 
not entirely related to just widget kit and lock  
11:36 - screen widgets but just in general keep in mind 
how the gauge view works so let's also add that  
11:42 - and you will see the rectangular widget 
is a lot larger about twice the width of  
11:47 - the circular widget so let's exit out of all of 
this let's hit done and select this lock screen  
11:54 - and then you will see that we have all three of 
our widgets that we just created here right on  
11:59 - the user's lock screen so in this lesson you'll 
learn about io 16's new lock screen widgets
