00:04 - Hello and welcome in this 14 day beginner
00:06 - challenge, you're going to start your
journey off with a bang,
00:09 - you're going to learn how apps are made
and how they end up on the App Store.
00:13 - You're going to get familiar with Xcode
and start your very own app project.
00:17 - You're going to learn how to build user
interfaces with Swift UI and you're going
00:21 - to learn Swift programming basics so that
you can read and write simple Swift code.
00:26 - Now, in the next 14 lessons,
you're going to gain all of these new
00:29 - skills and you're going to have built your
very own app that you can install on your
00:33 - device and show all of your friends
and family what you've done.
00:37 - More importantly than that, however,
00:38 - you will be extremely confident
and excited to continue growing your app
00:43 - development skills beyond
what we've covered here.
00:46 - This really could be the start
00:47 - of something new for you now,
just in case you're new around here.
00:50 - My name is Chris and welcome
to CodeWithChris.
00:52 - The place to be if you want
to learn how to make an app.
00:55 - We've got thousands of people with no
00:58 - coding experience,
how to code and how to make apps.
01:00 - And I'm sure that we can do the same thing
01:02 - for you. On that note, why are you
here learning app development?
01:06 - Let me know by leaving a quick comment
below and on your way down there,
01:09 - if you wouldn't mind, please give
this video a quick thumbs up.
01:12 - It really helps the video out,
and I appreciate that so much.
01:15 - OK, so if you're ready, let's roll
up our sleeves and get started.
01:19 - I'm going to walk through this diagram
01:21 - and then after I'll tell you
where to get all of the pieces.
01:24 - It all starts with the Xcode idea.
01:27 - Now,
ID stands for Integrated Development
01:30 - Environment, which is
a term for the application.
01:34 - And all of the tools a developer uses
01:36 - to build something for the rest of this
course will simply call it Xcode.
01:41 - This is where we build our app by writing
Swift code, building the user interface or
01:46 - UI for short and connecting
it with all of our data.
01:49 - Swift is the programming language we use
01:51 - to express our logic and to tell
the system what we want to do.
01:54 - We can even build the UI through
01:57 - Swift Xcode as you'll soon see
that SwiftUI is a UI framework that makes
02:02 - it easy for us to rapidly build
apps for all of Apple's platforms.
02:07 - A nice benefit of learning Xcode,
Swift and Swift UI is that they're
02:12 - the same skills and tools used to build
all apps for all of Apple's platforms,
02:17 - including iOS, iPad OS,
TV OS, Watch US and Mac OS.
02:23 - And in some cases your app will be able
02:25 - to work on multiple platforms
without much changes at all.
02:29 - Now, once your app is built, you could
distribute it with Apple's App Store.
02:34 - This is done by joining
02:35 - the Apple Developer program,
which requires an annual enrollment fee.
02:39 - Once you're enrolled,
you get access to multiple benefits,
02:42 - including the App Store, Connect Portal,
Test Flight and the provisioning portal.
02:48 - There are some more benefits,
02:49 - including access to beta software
and support from Apple engineers.
02:53 - And I'll provide a link
to the full list below.
02:55 - The provisioning portal gives you access
02:58 - to tools for identifying
and Xcode signing your app.
03:01 - It's like putting your signature
03:02 - on the app so that Apple
can identify who built it.
03:05 - And this is important for the safety
of the end users downloading your app.
03:09 - And it's also important for you because it
03:11 - stops malicious coders
from pretending to be you.
03:14 - Once your app is in a testable state,
03:16 - test flight allows you to invite people
to download and beta test your app.
03:20 - They'll be able to send feedback and bug
03:23 - reports directly to you through the Test
flight program,
03:26 - use test flight to ensure that your app is
as polished as it can be before launch.
03:31 - And finally, App Store Connect is where
you'll create the app listing for your
03:35 - app, including all of the
metadata and screenshots.
03:38 - If your app has in app purchases,
03:41 - this is also where you would configure
them once your app is tested
03:44 - and the listing is ready, you can upload
the app from Xcode to App Store Connect.
03:49 - From there, the certification team
at Apple will review your app to ensure
03:53 - that it meets the App Store
quality guidelines.
03:57 - This takes a couple of days and don't
worry if you fail because you can fix
04:00 - whatever they point out
and resubmit it for review.
04:02 - If everything looks good, they'll approve
the app and your app will be live.
04:06 - Congratulations.
04:10 - All right, so where can you get these
04:12 - different pieces of the Apple
developer ecosystem?
04:15 - You can download Xcode for free
from the Mac App Store.
04:18 - I'll provide a link below.
04:19 - You don't need to get Swift or SwiftUI.
04:22 - Those just come with Xcode.
04:25 - As for the Apple developer program,
04:27 - I'll provide a link
to the enrollment page below.
04:29 - I want to mention that joining the Apple
developer program is completely optional.
04:34 - If your goal isn't to distribute apps
into the App Store, don't join it.
04:38 - You'll still be able to learn
how to build apps for yourself.
04:44 - So that's the Apple developer ecosystem,
it's the process that I'll be taking you
04:48 - through if you continue
on with this app journey.
04:51 - Now, by the end of this learning path,
04:53 - you'll be building your own apps, using
all of these tools that we've covered.
04:56 - Even if you don't have any coding
experience right now,
04:59 - I promise you you'll be surprised at what
you can do by the end of this challenge.
05:03 - Now, I highly recommend that you go over
05:05 - to CodeWithChris dot com
and create an account.
05:08 - You can take the same course and get all
of the supplemental material and get
05:13 - access to all of the quizzes and exercises
to make your learning truly effective.
05:18 - In fact, if you go and do that right now,
05:21 - there is a quiz that you can take to
reinforce what you've learned here today.
05:25 - Now, the last thing I want to say is thank
you and I appreciate it so much
05:28 - that you're learning
with me in the next lesson.
05:31 - And we're going to dive right into Xcode.
05:33 - And if you don't want to miss it,
05:34 - make sure you subscribe to the channel
by hitting that subscribe button below
05:38 - and turn on notifications
so that you get notified.
05:41 - All right.
I'll see you in the next lesson.
