00:00 - hello welcome to learn Swift for
00:03 - beginners series lessons for in this
00:06 - lesson you're going to learn about
00:07 - switch statements and like the if
00:09 - statement it allows you to make
00:11 - decisions with your code alright so
00:13 - let's get started let's start by
00:19 - creating a new playground for this
00:21 - example and I'm going to start labeling
00:25 - these after the lessons here and I
00:29 - should have done this sooner but I want
00:31 - to point out that Apple does have a
00:33 - swift programming language guide and in
00:37 - this guy that goes through all of the
00:38 - syntax and the structure and the
00:41 - different concepts of the Swift
00:43 - programming language it's what we're
00:45 - doing in these videos and more in fact
00:47 - so if you want something to read you can
00:50 - go ahead and visit this website here
00:53 - I'll have the link below the video but
00:56 - one thing to note is that it may be a
00:58 - little bit complicated for the absolute
01:00 - beginner who doesn't have programming
01:02 - background but give it a try and it's a
01:05 - great compliment to watch with this
01:07 - learn Swift series that you're watching
01:09 - in fact as we're going through the
01:11 - different concepts and these videos I'll
01:12 - point out in the guide where they are so
01:15 - for example we're looking at the switch
01:17 - statement today and that resides under
01:19 - control flow and you can see here what
01:22 - the basic syntax is for this switch
01:25 - statement ok so let's jump back into our
01:28 - playground and we can do an example of a
01:32 - switch statement so in here I'm going to
01:35 - basically do the same example or similar
01:39 - example as the one in the guide and I'm
01:44 - going to introduce a new data type
01:46 - called character and it's basically like
01:48 - a string except that it's just a single
01:51 - character like that and with an if
01:55 - statement we can do something like this
01:56 - if some character is you know equals a
02:02 - for example ok like we have right here
02:06 - print is an A
02:11 - and this is going to be true and it's
02:13 - going to print this out and then we're
02:15 - going to have else--if and we're going
02:16 - to maybe check another condition if we
02:18 - wanted to you know respond to different
02:20 - cases depending on what letter this
02:23 - variable is right but you can use a
02:26 - switch statement and it looks like this
02:28 - so we start with the switch keyword then
02:31 - you have the value what you're
02:33 - considering in our case that value is in
02:35 - the variable some character so that's
02:38 - what we would put in there and then you
02:40 - open up a pair of curly brackets inside
02:44 - these curly brackets you have different
02:46 - case labels so you would have case if
02:49 - you wanted to consider the case where
02:52 - the value is an a you would have case a
02:55 - and then you have colon and you would
02:58 - have something to do if it were dot case
03:01 - perhaps this would be easier to
03:04 - visualize if we take a look at the
03:06 - playground so let's jump back to the
03:07 - playground here so let me say switch
03:10 - statement right on the value that we're
03:13 - considering so that's some character and
03:15 - you open up a pair of curly brackets
03:18 - like that and then you have your case
03:20 - labels so I have case you know if it's
03:22 - an A and if I want to do something for
03:26 - this case right then you have a colon
03:28 - and in here you would print say is an A
03:33 - like that and if there's another case
03:36 - right I would have case B for example
03:40 - and I would say is a B and lastly if
03:46 - none of those cases are true I would
03:48 - have a default case like that and I
03:51 - would say print some fallback
03:59 - so in this switch statement this case
04:02 - was true right so it printed out this
04:04 - statement and it doesn't do the rest and
04:06 - you can have more lines of code in here
04:08 - than just the print statement in all of
04:10 - our examples you know I just wanted to
04:12 - show that it's coming into here this
04:15 - branch but you could execute more code
04:17 - in here now the case where you know
04:20 - character is a B then we would come
04:23 - into here and jump into here now if it's
04:26 - not none of those cases we would have
04:29 - default and they would print that and of
04:33 - course you can have a whole bunch of
04:36 - different case labels it just doesn't
04:37 - have to be the two that we have here the
04:40 - benefit of using a switch statement is
04:42 - that rather than using an if statement
04:44 - and having all of these else if clauses
04:46 - reading this is much more clean and it's
04:50 - a lot easier to read as well so what if
04:54 - you wanted let's say two different cases
04:56 - to run the same piece of code or the
04:58 - same block of code so for example if I
05:01 - change this to say is B or you know FC
05:07 - is a B or C I could do something like
05:11 - this with this case label here I can do
05:14 - that comma and then I can put this other
05:17 - case there so this saves me from having
05:21 - to have another case C and then you know
05:24 - the same code I can put a comma here put
05:29 - the other case here and have either one
05:31 - of these cases use the same block of
05:33 - code so now you can see that it comes
05:36 - into this case here prints is a B or C
05:40 - instead of coming into default so why
05:45 - would you want to use a switch statement
05:47 - over an if statement
05:48 - well is there are a lot of different
05:50 - conditions that you want to check on a
05:52 - certain value rather than using an if
05:54 - statement with a whole ton of else if
05:57 - you can use this switch statement which
05:59 - is easier to read and easier to
06:01 - understand you're probably going to use
06:04 - the if statement more than the switch
06:06 - statement but it's still a handy tool to
06:09 - have in your arsenal so I highly
06:11 - recommend that you try this out in your
06:13 - playground so that's it for switch
06:16 - statements this is a short one I hope

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to learn Swift for beginners series lessons for in this lesson you're going to learn about switch statements and like the if statement it allows you to make decisions with your code alright so let's get started let's start by creating a new playground for this example and I'm going to start labeling these after the lessons here and I should have done this sooner but I want to point out that Apple does have a swift programming language guide and in this guy that goes through all of the syntax and the structure and the different concepts of the Swift programming language it's what we're doing in these videos and more in fact so if you want something to read you can go ahead and visit this website here I'll have the link below the video but one thing to note is that it may be a little bit complicated for the absolute beginner who doesn't have programming background but give it a try and it's a great compliment to watch with this learn Swift series that you're watching in fact as we're going through the different concepts and these videos I'll point out in the guide where they are so for example we're looking at the switch statement today and that resides under control flow and you can see here what the basic syntax is for this switch statement ok so let's jump back into our playground and we can do an example of a switch statement so in here I'm going to basically do the same example or similar example as the one in the guide and I'm going to introduce a new data type called character and it's basically like a string except that it's just a single character like that and with an if statement we can do something like this if some character is you know equals a for example ok like we have right here print is an A and this is going to be true and it's going to print this out and then we're going to have elseif and we're going to maybe check another condition if we wanted to you know respond to different cases depending on what letter this variable is right but you can use a switch statement and it looks like this so we start with the switch keyword then you have the value what you're considering in our case that value is in the variable some character so that's what we would put in there and then you open up a pair of curly brackets inside these curly brackets you have different case labels so you would have case if you wanted to consider the case where the value is an a you would have case a and then you have colon and you would have something to do if it were dot case perhaps this would be easier to visualize if we take a look at the playground so let's jump back to the playground here so let me say switch statement right on the value that we're considering so that's some character and you open up a pair of curly brackets like that and then you have your case labels so I have case you know if it's an A and if I want to do something for this case right then you have a colon and in here you would print say is an A like that and if there's another case right I would have case B for example and I would say is a B and lastly if none of those cases are true I would have a default case like that and I would say print some fallback so in this switch statement this case was true right so it printed out this statement and it doesn't do the rest and you can have more lines of code in here than just the print statement in all of our examples you know I just wanted to show that it's coming into here this branch but you could execute more code in here now the case where you know character is a B then we would come into here and jump into here now if it's not none of those cases we would have default and they would print that and of course you can have a whole bunch of different case labels it just doesn't have to be the two that we have here the benefit of using a switch statement is that rather than using an if statement and having all of these else if clauses reading this is much more clean and it's a lot easier to read as well so what if you wanted let's say two different cases to run the same piece of code or the same block of code so for example if I change this to say is B or you

you know the same code I can put a comma here put the other case here and have either one of these cases use the same block of code so now you can see that it comes into this case here prints is a B or C instead of coming into default so why would you want to use a switch statement over an if statement well is there are a lot of different conditions that you want to check on a certain value rather than using an if statement with a whole ton of else if you can use this switch statement which is easier to read and easier to understand you're probably going to use the if statement more than the switch statement but it's still a handy tool to have in your arsenal so I highly recommend that you try this out in your playground so that's it for switch statements this is a short one I hope
