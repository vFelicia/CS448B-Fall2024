00:01 - hey coders how's it going it's Chris
00:04 - here and today I'm going to show you how
00:05 - to use this library called SD web image
00:08 - now if you've ever used uiimageview in
00:11 - your application and you wanted to grab
00:13 - an image off the internet kind of like
00:16 - this one how I have it on my server you
00:18 - can very easily do that with SD web
00:21 - image now what does is it adds a method
00:24 - to your uiimageview class called
00:27 - set image with URL and then very simply
00:29 - it's going to fetch that image
00:31 - asynchronously in the background and
00:33 - then when it's done it's going to load
00:34 - it into your uiimageview so all you have
00:37 - to do really is to specify the URL of
00:39 - the image so like I said very handy to
00:41 - have now we're going to install this
00:43 - library as a cocoa pod and if you didn't
00:46 - watch my tutorial on how to install and
00:48 - setup cocoa pods just click on that
00:50 - thumbnail in the upper right hand corner
00:51 - and it'll take you to the video set up
00:54 - only takes less than 5 minutes you'll be
00:56 - up and running in no time so if you have
00:58 - cocoa pods installed and ready to go
01:00 - we're going to just scroll down to the
01:02 - section installing with cocoa pods and
01:05 - we're going to follow these instructions
01:06 - here but first let's create our Xcode
01:09 - project so I'm going to create a brand
01:12 - new single view application here so I'm
01:15 - just going to call it SD web image demo
01:19 - and make sure that the language is Swift
01:22 - and these options down here don't really
01:24 - matter for this demo and click Next and
01:27 - I'm going to save it on the desktop now
01:30 - that our project is set up I'm going to
01:32 - close Xcode I'm going to close that
01:34 - project and press command space bar and
01:37 - type in terminal because we're going to
01:39 - have to initialize the pod file for our
01:41 - project so I saved it on the desktop by
01:44 - pressing PWD I can see which directory I
01:46 - am and now I know I just have to type
01:49 - cd' desktop to go to the desktop folder
01:52 - and it since it's on my desktop I can
01:54 - type in CD SD web I'm gonna type tab to
01:58 - autocomplete that and now I'm inside my
02:01 - project folder and then I'm going to
02:02 - type pod in it so that's going to create
02:05 - the pod file let's take a look at our
02:07 - project folder to see if it indeed if it
02:11 - has that so there it is
02:13 - the pot file now I'm going to
02:15 - right-click open with and I'm going to
02:17 - open it in my text editor sub lime text
02:19 - - you can download that if you want but
02:21 - you can also open it in your own text
02:24 - editor now if we're using Swift it says
02:27 - here be sure to uncomment the use
02:29 - frameworks and set our target to eight
02:32 - so we're going to uncomment this
02:34 - platform we're going to uncomment use
02:36 - frameworks and inside here we're just
02:39 - going to copy this command C and command
02:43 - V we're going to put it in there now I'm
02:45 - going to save it by pressing command S
02:46 - and let's go back to terminal and then
02:51 - LS we can see our pod file there and
02:54 - let's type in pod install just to let
02:58 - you know it can take a little while you
03:00 - can see for me I cancelled it and
03:02 - restarted it because I thought it wasn't
03:04 - working but after I let it be for a few
03:06 - minutes it just went and did its thing
03:08 - so just a heads up it can take a little
03:10 - while so now that this is completed we
03:13 - can open up our Xcode project again so
03:15 - let's go into our project directory it's
03:18 - created this XC workspace file for us
03:20 - which is the one we're going to use and
03:22 - open okay so first off I'm going to
03:24 - press command B just to build the
03:26 - project and then next I'm going to go to
03:29 - the storyboard and I'm going to add an
03:32 - image view to our storyboard so I'm just
03:37 - going to put it right there I'm going to
03:39 - Center it horizontally and vertically
03:42 - and I'm actually going to give it a
03:43 - defined height and width as well because
03:46 - I have I'm going to download this logo
03:49 - and I know the height and width here so
03:50 - with this 522 and height is through 24
03:53 - so let's go ahead and add those so
03:56 - height so with this 522 and height is
04:03 - 324 let's add those constraints and
04:06 - let's update the frames for that guy and
04:09 - so there it is next I'm going to go into
04:12 - assistant editor and then I'm going to
04:15 - create an outlet for this image view I'm
04:19 - going to call it I'm just going to call
04:20 - it image view because what I'm going to
04:22 - do let's go back to standard view
04:24 - control about Swift
04:26 - I'm going to do is load the image
04:29 - through this URL right here so let's
04:31 - just copy that URL for now let's go up
04:34 - here and write import SD web image
04:38 - because we're going to be using that and
04:39 - then now in the viewdidload
04:41 - I can type image view dot SD you can see
04:46 - there's a bunch of new methods that
04:48 - wouldn't have existed if I didn't use SD
04:50 - image view set image with URL okay and
04:55 - there's a couple of different ones where
04:57 - you can specify a completed block of
04:59 - code to execute after the image has been
05:01 - downloaded and set you can also specify
05:03 - placeholder image to show before the
05:06 - image has finished downloading I'm just
05:09 - going to use this basic one right here
05:11 - that's going to download the image at
05:13 - the specified URL and then it's going to
05:16 - set that image view with that downloaded
05:19 - image up here let's create an nsurl
05:22 - first so let image URL equals nsurl I'm
05:29 - going to create this one with a string
05:30 - take note that it returns an optional NS
05:33 - URL type so there's my URL and it
05:37 - returns an optional right so let's
05:40 - specify that and then if it does have a
05:43 - value so let's use optional binding if
05:45 - let URL equals image URL so if that URL
05:53 - exists then I'm going to set the image
05:59 - view with it after it downloads the
06:00 - image I'm going to pass it into this
06:01 - method right here alright and that's
06:03 - basically it so I'm going to run it and
06:05 - you're going to see hopefully this works
06:11 - all right there we go that might have
06:14 - been a little fast but it did go out and
06:16 - download that image and set it into my
06:18 - image view now it's a little bigger
06:20 - because I did actually set the width of
06:22 - my image view to be 522 and that's wider
06:26 - than this view is the great thing about
06:29 - this is if I stop the app and I run it
06:32 - again you're going to see that it's
06:34 - really fast because it does cache the
06:37 - image so it's not going to redownload
06:39 - the
06:40 - if it doesn't need to so this is just a
06:42 - quick video to show you how handy a
06:44 - little library like SD web image is I
06:46 - hope you guys have enjoyed it tomorrow
06:48 - there won't be a video because I'm going
06:50 - to be spending Christmas day with my
06:51 - family so I'll talk to you guys on
06:53 - Monday instead all right thank you so
06:55 - much for watching please subscribe and
06:57 - share and like this video
06:59 - happy holidays to everyone and I'll see
07:01 - you guys on Monday bye for now
