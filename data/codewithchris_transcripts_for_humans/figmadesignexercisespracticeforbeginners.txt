00:00 - hey code crew what's up as promised here
00:02 - are some figma exercises for you to do
00:04 - just to get some practice and to get
00:06 - comfortable with creating graphics with
00:08 - figma actually you can use any sorts of
00:11 - graphics program that you want you still
00:13 - should be able to produce these
00:15 - following exercises so for the first
00:17 - exercise I've got a rounded button very
00:20 - simple just a rounded pill shape with a
00:23 - text in the front and you know what you
00:25 - do on your screen doesn't have to be
00:27 - exactly alike but the point is to get
00:31 - you to figure out how to do things like
00:33 - rounded corners and angles and and
00:35 - cropping and masking and that sort of
00:37 - stuff learning these sort of building
00:39 - blocks will allow you to construct more
00:41 - complex you eyes okay so for exercise
00:44 - number two is to draw an X and this is a
00:47 - not an icon this is you know two
00:49 - different shapes you don't have to know
00:51 - how to set angles of the shapes and this
00:54 - one is just in the arrow again this is
00:56 - not an icon these are two separate
00:58 - shapes and you're gonna have to
00:59 - construct the arrow and construct the
01:01 - circle I won't get too much into it or
01:04 - else I will I will reveal the answer
01:07 - this one is starting to get a little
01:09 - more complicated and you start to notice
01:11 - so that we can reuse elements that we
01:14 - did before so this was from you know the
01:16 - first exercise so you can just add that
01:18 - to here but you notice that there's some
01:21 - see-through some sort of lighter opacity
01:24 - on these circles here this next one is
01:26 - to create a form and this was from this
01:30 - exercise right here and then this one is
01:33 - starting to layer imagery and you can
01:36 - see there's an opacity element to it
01:39 - rounded corners
01:41 - notice that I'm starting to play with a
01:43 - couple of different colors this one is
01:46 - an exercise in masking so you take an
01:49 - image any image it doesn't have to be a
01:51 - face and then try to apply a circular
01:54 - mask to it or if you're clever maybe
01:57 - you'll play around with the radius and
02:00 - then this one is just taking that and
02:01 - putting it into a more putting it into
02:05 - the context of a chat bubble so I highly
02:08 - urge for you to go through these
02:09 - exercises yourself either in figma
02:11 - sketch or your graphics
02:13 - of choice and then after you do that
02:15 - continue watching for the solutions for
02:18 - these exercises alright so now let's run
02:35 - through the solutions for these
02:37 - exercises I'm going to keep these on the
02:39 - screen right here at the top and we're
02:41 - going to just add an artboard below each
02:44 - exercise and I'll show you the solution
02:46 - for them hopefully you've had a chance
02:48 - to try them on your own ok let's create
02:51 - an upper right there and I'll just
02:54 - duplicate it for each one there is
03:01 - alright so this is just the rectangle
03:04 - with rounded corners so go ahead and
03:07 - press R or choose this and we're gonna
03:10 - add a rectangle like that and we're
03:13 - going to I'll just select the same color
03:16 - but you can really choose any color
03:17 - you'd want and then you can change the
03:19 - corner radius and you can either give a
03:21 - number or you can drag this or you can
03:27 - just press up so give a corner radius
03:30 - like that let's add some text
03:34 - we can change the text to white and we
03:39 - can increase its size oh that's that's
03:42 - really big but it goes something like
03:45 - this now I'm not gonna try to make it
03:47 - exactly like that one my point is just
03:51 - to show you kind of the techniques so it
03:54 - looks something like that
03:56 - okay so the next one we're gonna do an X
04:00 - so this one is really simple so we're
04:03 - gonna create a rectangle oops let's
04:05 - erase that press R let's create a thin
04:09 - rectangle like that and let's make it
04:13 - red and if you don't want to make it
04:18 - thinner like that you can always just
04:19 - adjust the height right and then now
04:24 - we're gonna adjust the angle there's
04:25 - actually you can just do this right or
04:28 - you can type in a number so we'll say 45
04:31 - degrees and now at this point you have
04:33 - several options you can either duplicate
04:36 - this in fact actually will have two so
04:39 - you can right click and you can
04:41 - duplicate it actually it doesn't seem to
04:48 - be a command in this menu here but if
04:50 - you you can either copy command C and
04:52 - then command V to paste another one of
04:55 - these or you can press command D and you
04:58 - would have duplicated it now for this
05:00 - one the second one right you can do
05:04 - negative 45 like that and you can kind
05:09 - of just put them together like that now
05:13 - that you have these two lines let's
05:15 - group them together press command G put
05:18 - them in a group now you can move them
05:19 - around as a group you can also combine
05:24 - these two shapes into one using this
05:26 - using Union and that's going to just
05:31 - make that one shape okay what's the
05:34 - second one so we've got this arrow and
05:37 - we've got this green circle so let's
05:40 - let's let's do the circle
05:43 - so we're gonna choose ellipse and if you
05:49 - hold down shift and you drag it it will
05:51 - be a perfect circle so let's do that and
05:54 - we will make that green and then I want
06:01 - to kind of draw the arrow on top of it
06:04 - now there is this one but that's not how
06:09 - I did it if that's how you did it that's
06:10 - okay I actually built the arrow out of a
06:12 - rectangle and a triangle there but it's
06:18 - a little bit annoying to put shapes on
06:20 - top of each other because sometimes you
06:22 - might accidentally select this one and
06:25 - you might be moving this one when you're
06:26 - intending to move this one so you can
06:28 - actually do is lock down layers so if
06:30 - you know that you don't want to touch
06:32 - this ellipse right here you can click
06:34 - that little lock icon and now you're not
06:36 - going to be able to select it or
06:38 - accidentally modify it so that's really
06:39 - helpful when you're working on
06:42 - overlapping layers so let's build that
06:46 - little rectangle and make that white and
06:50 - that's a polygon do something like that
06:58 - let's make it white and let's sorry
07:05 - ninety degrees nope negative 90
07:13 - all right and then let's attach it on
07:15 - there so I'm gonna make this a single
07:19 - shape by selecting both of them and
07:22 - hitting Union and then I'm gonna be able
07:24 - to just position it right there so
07:27 - that's that okay so this one right here
07:30 - is just eat a piece of text with our
07:33 - button so let's add text first and by
07:39 - default it's kind of taken the text the
07:43 - last time I used the text element which
07:45 - was configured to be bold and 48 in
07:47 - Roboto so that's why that looks like
07:51 - that and I'm just gonna take this button
07:53 - that we did so I'm gonna take these the
07:55 - text and the rectangle I'm gonna put in
07:57 - a group I'm going to copy that by
07:59 - pressing command C and then pasting it
08:01 - here and just having it there and then
08:04 - in terms of creating these circles you
08:07 - press o or choose the ellipse and you
08:11 - just draw some ellipses there the key
08:14 - thing is to make sure that they're
08:16 - slightly transparent so I'm going to
08:19 - duplicate that and just move a button
08:21 - here
08:22 - sorry move the circle there and I'm
08:24 - gonna make that a slightly different
08:26 - blue and you can either modify the fill
08:31 - color so you can make it like a 50% blue
08:34 - like this or you can modify the opacity
08:37 - of the entire layer because sometimes
08:39 - the layer includes multiple elements and
08:41 - that would make the whole layer you know
08:43 - all of those elements whatever
08:46 - transparency you set here or you can do
08:50 - you know the color is is a
08:54 - semi-transparent color if you're gonna
08:58 - do that maybe this one can be 70 this
09:04 - one's really not showing through do
09:10 - something like that and then up here the
09:13 - same thing
09:20 - this one is not in the art world anymore
09:30 - duplicate it copy and paste where's that
09:37 - circle there it is oh I was copying and
09:41 - pasting these fills by accident you know
09:45 - so something like that that's how you're
09:47 - going to get that transparent effect so
09:48 - that was just an exercise in doing that
09:50 - this is this is a form so let's add
09:55 - create profile let's add another piece
10:05 - of text or under there
10:15 - all right and we are going to wrap that
10:20 - text here the thing here is that you
10:24 - want to line them up so you can kind of
10:26 - drag to line these guys up or you can
10:28 - select both of them and choose that to
10:31 - make sure that they are aligned on the
10:33 - left-hand side obviously this text
10:36 - shouldn't be bold and I just want to get
10:38 - regular actually and we can even make
10:41 - that text a little lighter okay so now
10:45 - we're gonna add two rectangles for the
10:47 - username and password and this is where
10:52 - I wanted you to look at using stroke so
10:55 - there's a stroke that you can add right
10:58 - which gives it that block border you can
11:01 - set the the width and even if you if you
11:05 - hit these ellipses right here you can
11:07 - decide if you want to have a rounded
11:12 - join right there you can play with it
11:14 - and it'll give you a different effect
11:15 - actually so this actually only applies
11:20 - when you have dashes sorry so when you
11:22 - have dashes let's say you wanted to do a
11:24 - dashed line like that so you can see a
11:27 - dashed line maybe two and two like that
11:32 - oh yeah choosing that is gonna give you
11:38 - a little bit of a different effect so
11:39 - you can kind of play around with those
11:41 - things I haven't really used it very
11:42 - much so I'm not very familiar with using
11:46 - that but I delete the fill and so you
11:49 - get that transparent text box effect
11:52 - which we see up here so I'm going to
11:55 - just duplicate that text field and move
11:59 - it down here and this one will be
12:02 - username double get that and this one
12:08 - would be password
12:11 - one tip if you want to line things up
12:13 - properly you can hold down the option
12:17 - key and you can kind of measure where
12:20 - things are positioned but let's say you
12:26 - want it to align password and this
12:27 - there's an easier way just using these
12:30 - guys so you can hold down cell shift
12:32 - select them both and you can choose
12:35 - something like align horizontal centers
12:39 - you know vertical centers so you see
12:42 - that password text just kind of moved in
12:44 - the middle and that way you don't have
12:45 - to manually position anything like that
12:48 - and then you can also select all of
12:51 - these all of these text labels and make
12:53 - sure they're aligned on the left hand
12:55 - side you can select this just the double
12:57 - check so you have something like that
13:00 - and you can go back to this well I can't
13:05 - select a green circle because I've
13:07 - locked it so let me unlock that circle
13:10 - and let me group these two together
13:14 - command G and then let me copy this
13:17 - entire thing and paste it into this
13:20 - artboard and then in order to scale for
13:23 - figma at least press k or you can choose
13:27 - it from here you can by default it's you
13:30 - know you're using move but if you want
13:31 - to scale something you can hit K go to
13:33 - scale and then you can see the
13:36 - difference in your cursor right there's
13:38 - that's move that's a scale so you can
13:42 - kind of see that the arrows have an
13:43 - additional sort of cap at the end then
13:46 - you know you're using scale to get out
13:48 - of scale mode just press escape we're
13:50 - gonna press K to get back into scale
13:51 - mode and you can just scale this down
13:53 - and one other note is that you know as
13:57 - as you add more elements and layers into
13:59 - your design things are going to get
14:01 - really confusing as you can see here
14:02 - group three doesn't really tell you what
14:05 - it is so you can you know call this a
14:07 - submit button or something like that if
14:09 - you just click it or double click it
14:12 - rather you can change that name so
14:15 - that's that one for this one let's copy
14:19 - this background because I I don't have
14:21 - this image anymore
14:23 - so I'm gonna just copy that image and
14:28 - I'm gonna paste it in here you can use
14:30 - any image to be honest it doesn't really
14:32 - matter all right so there's the image
14:35 - and I'm going to draw a box like that
14:42 - it's gonna be white let's say is 70% 90%
14:48 - see-through it's got a bit of corner
14:51 - radius on it let's say 20 that's a
14:53 - little bit too much that's a 15 let's
14:56 - see what else this looks like the
14:58 - requesting permission do you want allow
14:59 - this app to send you notifications no
15:01 - one yes
15:02 - okay so let's add the text you can see
15:19 - I'm just lining it up based on these
15:20 - these red lines that show up that tells
15:23 - me that it's in the center
15:36 - suddenly changing it to regular font and
15:42 - then we are going to just set the label
15:48 - like that let's scroll in a little bit
15:51 - hold down command and swipe or use your
15:55 - scroll wheel if you're using a mouse and
15:58 - you can zoom in and another one you see
16:01 - me panning around you hold down a space
16:04 - bar and you can click and drag and pan
16:06 - around so this is gonna be really useful
16:08 - hold down command right scroll and
16:11 - you're gonna zoom a hold down spacebar
16:14 - and drag it and you're gonna you're
16:17 - gonna be panning around so those two are
16:18 - really useful all right so let's go
16:21 - ahead and add these two buttons that was
16:26 - a rectangle this is text and then I'm
16:32 - gonna group these two into a button
16:36 - let's call it no button I'm gonna
16:40 - duplicate it just drag it over here this
16:44 - one's going to be the yes button and I'm
16:49 - going to change the text from and OH -
16:52 - ye-es
16:52 - and we're also going to just change this
16:55 - gray to a blue
17:04 - I'll change that to white all right so I
17:08 - think that that looks kind of like that
17:12 - see holding down what is this button
17:15 - option 31 from the from the headline
17:18 - there and 30 from the button more or
17:22 - less in the center 22 from the right 21
17:25 - like that so you can adjust make sure
17:28 - things line up properly okay so we are
17:33 - nearing the homestretch this one again I
17:37 - don't have that image so I'm just gonna
17:38 - select the face and I'm gonna copy it
17:41 - here but you can use any sort of image
17:44 - that you'd like let's create an ellipse
17:47 - hold down shift to make a perfect circle
17:55 - and then this part I usually I usually
17:57 - mess up so you can I think actually the
18:03 - ellipse goes underneath the image but
18:04 - let's give it a try so I select both of
18:07 - them and then say use us mask so you're
18:10 - gonna be using you want to use the
18:12 - ellipse as a mask for the image but if
18:16 - you do it like that and you get
18:17 - something like this obviously that's not
18:19 - the result you wanted just hit command Z
18:22 - or command Z to undo and just rearrange
18:26 - these two layers so if it was the
18:28 - ellipse on top first you didn't get the
18:30 - results you wanted put the image on top
18:32 - of the ellipse select both and then
18:35 - select use us mask and done that becomes
18:38 - the proper thing that we wanted to do so
18:41 - I tend to always mess that part up okay
18:45 - so this last one for this artboard you
18:48 - can actually set a fill on the artboard
18:50 - itself so let's set it black and
18:56 - relatively simple you're basically
18:58 - combining what you learned here right
19:00 - with this to create something like this
19:03 - so let's hit R for rectangle
19:05 - let's go like that
19:09 - white 90% rounded corner 15 that looks
19:17 - more like 10 actually and then we are
19:21 - going to copy this face actually we need
19:26 - to copy it as the whole thing so again
19:28 - let's group that up just call it profile
19:32 - icon let's copy this and paste it here
19:37 - and we're going to use our scaling hit K
19:42 - scale it down you'll notice that in the
19:46 - exercise that I had there is a slightly
19:49 - transparent border right so you can do
19:53 - the same thing using this stroke just
19:55 - add a stroke that's a two
20:08 - inside outside and actually I'm not
20:13 - really seeing it and so so you can see
20:22 - that this stroke is actually happening
20:25 - somewhere there you can see that red
20:27 - over there that's not what we want so it
20:30 - looks like actually I went down the
20:32 - wrong path adding a stroke to this group
20:36 - or the mask isn't gonna produce the
20:39 - effect that I want so I am going to
20:41 - remove this stroke like that and instead
20:45 - I'm going to create an ellipse and put
20:46 - it right under that profile image so I'm
20:50 - gonna just hold down shift and create an
20:53 - ellipse like that and just put it under
20:56 - the icon and let's make it the same size
20:58 - so I mean the the profile icon is 87 for
21:03 - the ellipse 90 let's say 91 so that's
21:09 - four points and I am going to select
21:13 - these two and I'm going to say align it
21:16 - horizontal centers and vertical centers
21:19 - that's gonna give that sort of stroke
21:22 - effect their stats can be bold
21:43 - that's a line both of these to the left
21:46 - all right so that's that's how you
21:49 - create that sort of effect there now a
21:52 - lot of these exercises might have seemed
21:54 - trivial or easy but it goes a long ways
21:58 - towards getting used to using the tools
22:00 - at your disposal and then it's going to
22:02 - be up to you to take a look at other
22:05 - great designs or using your own
22:07 - creativity and using the techniques that
22:10 - you know to produce an app design for
22:13 - your app idea if you really found this
22:15 - helpful in terms of developing your
22:17 - skills and familiarity inside design
22:20 - tools like figment sketch please let me
22:23 - know in the comment section below that
22:24 - you'd like to see more of these sorts of
22:26 - videos in this format and I'll be sure
22:28 - to do more but also don't forget to give

Cleaned transcript:

hey code crew what's up as promised here are some figma exercises for you to do just to get some practice and to get comfortable with creating graphics with figma actually you can use any sorts of graphics program that you want you still should be able to produce these following exercises so for the first exercise I've got a rounded button very simple just a rounded pill shape with a text in the front and you know what you do on your screen doesn't have to be exactly alike but the point is to get you to figure out how to do things like rounded corners and angles and and cropping and masking and that sort of stuff learning these sort of building blocks will allow you to construct more complex you eyes okay so for exercise number two is to draw an X and this is a not an icon this is you know two different shapes you don't have to know how to set angles of the shapes and this one is just in the arrow again this is not an icon these are two separate shapes and you're gonna have to construct the arrow and construct the circle I won't get too much into it or else I will I will reveal the answer this one is starting to get a little more complicated and you start to notice so that we can reuse elements that we did before so this was from you know the first exercise so you can just add that to here but you notice that there's some seethrough some sort of lighter opacity on these circles here this next one is to create a form and this was from this exercise right here and then this one is starting to layer imagery and you can see there's an opacity element to it rounded corners notice that I'm starting to play with a couple of different colors this one is an exercise in masking so you take an image any image it doesn't have to be a face and then try to apply a circular mask to it or if you're clever maybe you'll play around with the radius and then this one is just taking that and putting it into a more putting it into the context of a chat bubble so I highly urge for you to go through these exercises yourself either in figma sketch or your graphics of choice and then after you do that continue watching for the solutions for these exercises alright so now let's run through the solutions for these exercises I'm going to keep these on the screen right here at the top and we're going to just add an artboard below each exercise and I'll show you the solution for them hopefully you've had a chance to try them on your own ok let's create an upper right there and I'll just duplicate it for each one there is alright so this is just the rectangle with rounded corners so go ahead and press R or choose this and we're gonna add a rectangle like that and we're going to I'll just select the same color but you can really choose any color you'd want and then you can change the corner radius and you can either give a number or you can drag this or you can just press up so give a corner radius like that let's add some text we can change the text to white and we can increase its size oh that's that's really big but it goes something like this now I'm not gonna try to make it exactly like that one my point is just to show you kind of the techniques so it looks something like that okay so the next one we're gonna do an X so this one is really simple so we're gonna create a rectangle oops let's erase that press R let's create a thin rectangle like that and let's make it red and if you don't want to make it thinner like that you can always just adjust the height right and then now we're gonna adjust the angle there's actually you can just do this right or you can type in a number so we'll say 45 degrees and now at this point you have several options you can either duplicate this in fact actually will have two so you can right click and you can duplicate it actually it doesn't seem to be a command in this menu here but if you you can either copy command C and then command V to paste another one of these or you can press command D and you would have duplicated it now for this one the second one right you can do negative 45 like that and you can kind of just put them together like that now that you have these two lines let's group them together press command G put them in a group now you can move them around as a group you can also combine these two shapes into one using this using Union and that's going to just make that one shape okay what's the second one so we've got this arrow and we've got this green circle so let's let's let's do the circle so we're gonna choose ellipse and if you hold down shift and you drag it it will be a perfect circle so let's do that and we will make that green and then I want to kind of draw the arrow on top of it now there is this one but that's not how I did it if that's how you did it that's okay I actually built the arrow out of a rectangle and a triangle there but it's a little bit annoying to put shapes on top of each other because sometimes you might accidentally select this one and you might be moving this one when you're intending to move this one so you can actually do is lock down layers so if you know that you don't want to touch this ellipse right here you can click that little lock icon and now you're not going to be able to select it or accidentally modify it so that's really helpful when you're working on overlapping layers so let's build that little rectangle and make that white and that's a polygon do something like that let's make it white and let's sorry ninety degrees nope negative 90 all right and then let's attach it on there so I'm gonna make this a single shape by selecting both of them and hitting Union and then I'm gonna be able to just position it right there so that's that okay so this one right here is just eat a piece of text with our button so let's add text first and by default it's kind of taken the text the last time I used the text element which was configured to be bold and 48 in Roboto so that's why that looks like that and I'm just gonna take this button that we did so I'm gonna take these the text and the rectangle I'm gonna put in a group I'm going to copy that by pressing command C and then pasting it here and just having it there and then in terms of creating these circles you press o or choose the ellipse and you just draw some ellipses there the key thing is to make sure that they're slightly transparent so I'm going to duplicate that and just move a button here sorry move the circle there and I'm gonna make that a slightly different blue and you can either modify the fill color so you can make it like a 50% blue like this or you can modify the opacity of the entire layer because sometimes the layer includes multiple elements and that would make the whole layer you know all of those elements whatever transparency you set here or you can do you know the color is is a semitransparent color if you're gonna do that maybe this one can be 70 this one's really not showing through do something like that and then up here the same thing this one is not in the art world anymore duplicate it copy and paste where's that circle there it is oh I was copying and pasting these fills by accident you know so something like that that's how you're going to get that transparent effect so that was just an exercise in doing that this is this is a form so let's add create profile let's add another piece of text or under there all right and we are going to wrap that text here the thing here is that you want to line them up so you can kind of drag to line these guys up or you can select both of them and choose that to make sure that they are aligned on the lefthand side obviously this text shouldn't be bold and I just want to get regular actually and we can even make that text a little lighter okay so now we're gonna add two rectangles for the username and password and this is where I wanted you to look at using stroke so there's a stroke that you can add right which gives it that block border you can set the the width and even if you if you hit these ellipses right here you can decide if you want to have a rounded join right there you can play with it and it'll give you a different effect actually so this actually only applies when you have dashes sorry so when you have dashes let's say you wanted to do a dashed line like that so you can see a dashed line maybe two and two like that oh yeah choosing that is gonna give you a little bit of a different effect so you can kind of play around with those things I haven't really used it very much so I'm not very familiar with using that but I delete the fill and so you get that transparent text box effect which we see up here so I'm going to just duplicate that text field and move it down here and this one will be username double get that and this one would be password one tip if you want to line things up properly you can hold down the option key and you can kind of measure where things are positioned but let's say you want it to align password and this there's an easier way just using these guys so you can hold down cell shift select them both and you can choose something like align horizontal centers you know vertical centers so you see that password text just kind of moved in the middle and that way you don't have to manually position anything like that and then you can also select all of these all of these text labels and make sure they're aligned on the left hand side you can select this just the double check so you have something like that and you can go back to this well I can't select a green circle because I've locked it so let me unlock that circle and let me group these two together command G and then let me copy this entire thing and paste it into this artboard and then in order to scale for figma at least press k or you can choose it from here you can by default it's you know you're using move but if you want to scale something you can hit K go to scale and then you can see the difference in your cursor right there's that's move that's a scale so you can kind of see that the arrows have an additional sort of cap at the end then you know you're using scale to get out of scale mode just press escape we're gonna press K to get back into scale mode and you can just scale this down and one other note is that you know as as you add more elements and layers into your design things are going to get really confusing as you can see here group three doesn't really tell you what it is so you can you know call this a submit button or something like that if you just click it or double click it rather you can change that name so that's that one for this one let's copy this background because I I don't have this image anymore so I'm gonna just copy that image and I'm gonna paste it in here you can use any image to be honest it doesn't really matter all right so there's the image and I'm going to draw a box like that it's gonna be white let's say is 70% 90% seethrough it's got a bit of corner radius on it let's say 20 that's a little bit too much that's a 15 let's see what else this looks like the requesting permission do you want allow this app to send you notifications no one yes okay so let's add the text you can see I'm just lining it up based on these these red lines that show up that tells me that it's in the center suddenly changing it to regular font and then we are going to just set the label like that let's scroll in a little bit hold down command and swipe or use your scroll wheel if you're using a mouse and you can zoom in and another one you see me panning around you hold down a space bar and you can click and drag and pan around so this is gonna be really useful hold down command right scroll and you're gonna zoom a hold down spacebar and drag it and you're gonna you're gonna be panning around so those two are really useful all right so let's go ahead and add these two buttons that was a rectangle this is text and then I'm gonna group these two into a button let's call it no button I'm gonna duplicate it just drag it over here this one's going to be the yes button and I'm going to change the text from and OH yees and we're also going to just change this gray to a blue I'll change that to white all right so I think that that looks kind of like that see holding down what is this button option 31 from the from the headline there and 30 from the button more or less in the center 22 from the right 21 like that so you can adjust make sure things line up properly okay so we are nearing the homestretch this one again I don't have that image so I'm just gonna select the face and I'm gonna copy it here but you can use any sort of image that you'd like let's create an ellipse hold down shift to make a perfect circle and then this part I usually I usually mess up so you can I think actually the ellipse goes underneath the image but let's give it a try so I select both of them and then say use us mask so you're gonna be using you want to use the ellipse as a mask for the image but if you do it like that and you get something like this obviously that's not the result you wanted just hit command Z or command Z to undo and just rearrange these two layers so if it was the ellipse on top first you didn't get the results you wanted put the image on top of the ellipse select both and then select use us mask and done that becomes the proper thing that we wanted to do so I tend to always mess that part up okay so this last one for this artboard you can actually set a fill on the artboard itself so let's set it black and relatively simple you're basically combining what you learned here right with this to create something like this so let's hit R for rectangle let's go like that white 90% rounded corner 15 that looks more like 10 actually and then we are going to copy this face actually we need to copy it as the whole thing so again let's group that up just call it profile icon let's copy this and paste it here and we're going to use our scaling hit K scale it down you'll notice that in the exercise that I had there is a slightly transparent border right so you can do the same thing using this stroke just add a stroke that's a two inside outside and actually I'm not really seeing it and so so you can see that this stroke is actually happening somewhere there you can see that red over there that's not what we want so it looks like actually I went down the wrong path adding a stroke to this group or the mask isn't gonna produce the effect that I want so I am going to remove this stroke like that and instead I'm going to create an ellipse and put it right under that profile image so I'm gonna just hold down shift and create an ellipse like that and just put it under the icon and let's make it the same size so I mean the the profile icon is 87 for the ellipse 90 let's say 91 so that's four points and I am going to select these two and I'm going to say align it horizontal centers and vertical centers that's gonna give that sort of stroke effect their stats can be bold that's a line both of these to the left all right so that's that's how you create that sort of effect there now a lot of these exercises might have seemed trivial or easy but it goes a long ways towards getting used to using the tools at your disposal and then it's going to be up to you to take a look at other great designs or using your own creativity and using the techniques that you know to produce an app design for your app idea if you really found this helpful in terms of developing your skills and familiarity inside design tools like figment sketch please let me know in the comment section below that you'd like to see more of these sorts of videos in this format and
