00:00 - hey it's Chris here and in this tutorial I'll 
show you how to use a label in your Swift UI  
00:04 - project now labels allow you to show text with 
an icon side by side very easily let's Dive Right  
00:09 - In before we begin one quick note we have a 
free Xcode project containing sample code for  
00:14 - all of the Swift UI components use it for your 
own projects or just to learn from get it at
00:19 - cwc.com are a couple of different ones 
you can choose so for example if you  
00:33 - have an image in your asset Library you 
can specify the text that you want and  
00:39 - the image name here but what we are 
going to do instead is use this one  
00:44 - right here where we can specify a system 
image which means uh an SF symbol so for
00:51 - example just like that you've got a text with 
an icon side by side now an easy way to take  
01:01 - a look at what icons you have is to open 
up the library and go to the symbols tab  
01:06 - you can use any one of these for example eraser 
just replace that and you're good to go you can  
01:16 - also customize the label to look like a button 
for example let's change this back to the Apple  
01:21 - logo and then we are going to give this label 
some shape by specifying a width some height  
01:30 - we're going to set the background color to 
Black and then let's change the foreground  
01:37 - color to white so that we can actually see the 
text and finally we are going to add some rounded
01:45 - corners and then you have something that 
resembles a button now a word of warning  
01:52 - though you wouldn't want a label that looks like 
a button because this isn't actually interactive  
01:57 - it's not a button however with the button element 
you can specify custom views right with the link  
02:04 - element you can specify a custom view as well 
to represent that link or that button that is  
02:09 - taable and so this would be perfect you could 
use a label to put into your button or link or  
02:16 - any other view that is interactive if you want 
to download the sample code for this we've got  
02:21 - it all in a single handy exod project in fact 
it contains a sample code for all of the sft UI  
02:27 - components so that you can learn from it or copy 
and past P the code into your own project just  
02:32 - visit cc. swiftui dkit it's a free download I'll 
leave it in the description below the video too
