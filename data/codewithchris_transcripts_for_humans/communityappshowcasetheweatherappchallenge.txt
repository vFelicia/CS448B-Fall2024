00:27 - that your app had to fulfill and boy did
00:30 - you guys pull through i think that your
00:32 - apps
00:32 - turned out even better than the sample
00:34 - app that we showed
00:36 - so we had set a time limit for you guys
00:38 - to finish the app

00:42 - you
00:42 - didn't finish or you're still in
00:45 - progress don't worry
