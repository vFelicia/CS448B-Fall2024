00:00 - hello welcome to lesson 177 of the learn
00:03 - Swift for beginners Series in this video
00:06 - we're going to go through another
00:07 - collection type called the
00:11 - [Music]
00:13 - dictionary in the previous lesson we
00:16 - went through the array you can see here
00:18 - on the left hand side and with an array
00:20 - we had a collection of items where the
00:23 - order mattered so you can see in this
00:25 - example here in the Swift programming
00:27 - language guide six eggs is in spot
00:30 - number zero whereas bananas is in index
00:34 - 4 right well a dictionary on this right
00:37 - hand side here is a collection type
00:40 - where order does not matter so in arrays
00:44 - we retrieve the item by this index here
00:47 - and with the dictionary because order
00:48 - doesn't matter we retrieve these values
00:51 - using a key so each value has an
00:55 - Associated key when you put it into the
00:57 - dictionary and you need to pass it that
01:00 - same key and it's going to return for
01:02 - you the
01:04 - value now which collection type you use
01:07 - to organize your data is going to depend
01:09 - on obviously what sort of data you're
01:12 - storing does order matter if it does
01:15 - then the easy ANS is to use an array if
01:17 - it doesn't then maybe consider using a
01:19 - dictionary so this is a good example
01:22 - airports have these airport codes right
01:25 - so each airport has an Associated key
01:29 - and that's a a good point the keys
01:31 - should actually be unique for each uh
01:33 - value that you put
01:35 - in another great example of when to use
01:38 - a dictionary and this is the example
01:40 - that I'm going to use in this video is
01:42 - um license plates so for example each
01:45 - license plate is tied to a car and each
01:48 - license plate is unique so the key can
01:50 - be the license plate and the value can
01:52 - be maybe a description of the car or
01:54 - something like that let's jump into
01:57 - xcode um in this new playground that I
02:00 - have here and let me show you how to
02:02 - declare a new dictionary and how to work
02:04 - with
02:06 - it so why don't we
02:08 - declare a variable here and let's call
02:11 - it C DB to represent car
02:15 - database and let's uh looks like my
02:18 - playground has crashed okay and what
02:22 - we're going to do here is to declare a
02:25 - new dictionary so we use the keyword
02:28 - dictionary and followed by that we have
02:31 - these angle brackets where inside we
02:33 - specify the data type of the key
02:35 - followed by the data type of the value
02:38 - so for example let's pull up that
02:41 - example again in here this dictionary
02:44 - the key would be a string and the value
02:47 - would also be a string and so in between
02:50 - these two angle brackets we would just
02:51 - put string comma string and in order to
02:55 - create a um a new dictionary object we
02:58 - would just end off with those two
03:00 - brackets and like that we have an empty
03:03 - dictionary which stores key value Pairs
03:08 - and a key value pair is just a fancy
03:10 - name for one of these pairs of data you
03:13 - know a key and a
03:16 - value um this dictionary stores key
03:18 - value pairs where the key is a string
03:21 - and the value is a string as well now
03:24 - there is an easier way to write this out
03:27 - without having to write so much like let
03:29 - me show you that second way VAR car DB
03:34 - uh let's just say db2 is equal to use
03:38 - the square brackets and then you specify
03:40 - the data type of the key followed by
03:42 - colon and then the data type of the
03:44 - value and again we have these two
03:47 - brackets here to create a new instance
03:50 - of that dictionary or new dictionary
03:52 - object and that's equivalent these two
03:55 - are the same thing doesn't this look
03:58 - very similar to uh declaring a brand new
04:00 - array don't get confused so for example
04:04 - declaring a new string array would look
04:08 - like this would be my empty array that
04:12 - is expecting to contain string objects
04:15 - and this is an empty dictionary that is
04:18 - expecting to contain key value pairs
04:21 - where the key is string and value is
04:23 - string as well okay so we're going to
04:26 - stick with this sort of Declaration here
04:29 - so I'm just going going to go ahead
04:30 - delete this array example that was just
04:32 - for demonstration and delete that so now
04:34 - we just have C DB is an empty dictionary
04:37 - now how do I assign something into the
04:40 - car database dictionary well I would do
04:43 - car
04:44 - DB and then I would use these two square
04:48 - brackets here and I would pass in a key
04:51 - or I would specify a key rather and this
04:55 - key would be a license plate right so
04:57 - you know this is going to be different
04:58 - depending where you are in the world um
05:02 - but let's just say it's like
05:04 - that and then you assign the value into
05:08 - the dictionary for that key so this
05:11 - would be let's say a blue uh
05:16 - Ferrari
05:18 - now this value blue Ferrari is tied to
05:22 - this key jsd
05:24 - 238 how do I retrieve the value well
05:28 - it's very simple I just give it the
05:32 - key so if someone were to look up this
05:35 - license plate let's say I'm I print this
05:38 - out like
05:41 - that it would print out blue Ferrari but
05:44 - notice that it's wrapped in an optional
05:47 - tag because for example if I passed in a
05:52 - key that doesn't exist right let's pass
05:55 - in like ASD 238 then you can see there
05:59 - is no no value for that key right so
06:02 - that's why it returns nil so that's why
06:04 - when you access a dictionary and you
06:06 - pass in a key it returns to you an
06:09 - optional uh whatever data type that your
06:12 - value is so when you pass in a key into
06:15 - your dictionary to retrieve a value um
06:18 - just expect that it is an optional and
06:20 - you may need to unwrap it and check if
06:22 - it's nil before using
06:25 - it okay so what if I wanted to uh let's
06:29 - let's label this
06:31 - so before we continue on this is
06:34 - declaring a new dictionary this is uh
06:41 - adding key value
06:44 - Pairs and this
06:47 - is retrieving
06:51 - data and how do we update a value for a
06:56 - key well it looks exactly like this up
07:00 - here so you specify the key that you
07:04 - want to update the value
07:08 - for and here we can say that this guy
07:12 - now is a red Ferrari maybe it got a
07:15 - paint job or something so when you pass
07:17 - in this key from now on you're going to
07:19 - get this new value because this
07:22 - basically overwrote whatever was there
07:25 - before and in order to remove a value
07:30 - remove a key value pair let's say you
07:33 - can do something like this you pass in
07:36 - the
07:38 - key
07:41 - 238 and you assign it nil and actually
07:44 - that is going to remove the key value
07:46 - pair from your
07:48 - dictionary now I'm going to show you how
07:51 - to iterate over all of the key value
07:54 - pairs in your dictionary so why don't we
07:56 - just add a second key value pair in here
07:59 - so so that we have more than one item to
08:07 - display okay and this one can be a
08:11 - green uh
08:14 - Lamborghini I think that's how you spell
08:16 - it I don't have one so I don't know for
08:20 - sure and now let's iterate over it wish
08:25 - I had one though iterate over it we use
08:28 - a for Loop
08:30 - so we can say
08:31 - for um essentially for each key value
08:35 - pair inside the dictionary do something
08:38 - and the way you
08:40 - specify this is you pass in um we use
08:45 - what's basically called a tupple okay
08:47 - and so you can think of a tupple as a
08:50 - set of variables or a bunch of variables
08:53 - so we'll we're going to say uh
08:57 - license car
09:00 - in cdb now the in keyword shouldn't be
09:04 - new to you because you guys learned
09:07 - about the for Loop in a previous Swift
09:09 - lesson so um basically what should be
09:13 - new to you though is this this is a
09:16 - tupple so for each tupple in this
09:21 - dictionary we can do something what's
09:23 - going to happen is it's going to uh grab
09:27 - each key value pair and the key is going
09:30 - to be inside license and the value is
09:33 - going to be car like that so now inside
09:36 - this for loop it's going to iterate
09:38 - twice and I'm going to find this key or
09:43 - this license inside this license
09:45 - variable and I'm going to find the car
09:49 - uh this string here blue Ferrari or
09:51 - green Lamborghini inside this car
09:53 - variable and it knows even though
09:56 - there's no data type associated with
09:58 - this tub
10:00 - because my dictionary is string string
10:03 - for the key and the value I'm going to
10:06 - Simply print
10:08 - car like that and you can see
10:12 - that H it's just it's printing one key
10:16 - value pair here it's printing one car
10:18 - but I have two
10:19 - items and the reason is because we've
10:23 - actually removed a key value pair with
10:25 - this statement here so if I just comment
10:28 - this guy out
10:30 - we have our two
10:32 - cars and it's a red Ferrari because we
10:35 - changed it up here now I can also print
10:38 - out the license I can say you know
10:43 - license
10:45 - um you know I can say something
10:53 - like car has a
10:58 - license
11:02 - like
11:05 - that has a
11:10 - license so that pretty much wraps up
11:12 - using a dictionary and you're going to
11:14 - find that it will come in handy
11:16 - alongside arrays in organizing your data
11:19 - so thanks for watching if you like this
11:21 - video please give it a thumbs up and
11:22 - please share it with anyone you know
11:24 - who's also interested in Swift thanks
11:26 - for watching I'll see you guys next time
