00:05 - so what do you need to get started with
00:06 - iOS programming well all you really need
00:09 - is a Mac and the will to learn so I
00:11 - realized that a Mac is kind of a hefty
00:14 - investment if if you don't want to spend
00:16 - a grand for a Macbook you can actually
00:18 - spend $500 to buy a Mac Mini or better
00:22 - yet you can get a used Mac Mini off of
00:24 - you know eBay or kiji for $200 or $300
00:28 - and that'll do fine so once you have
00:30 - your Mac um then you're going to
00:32 - download xcode now a lot of people get
00:34 - confused you know what is xcode and what
00:36 - is objective c xcode is the app on your
00:39 - Mac which you're going to write your
00:41 - code in Objective C is the programming
00:43 - language that you need to learn in order
00:45 - to write your code so in short you need
00:48 - to learn Objective C because you need to
00:50 - know you know what to write how to code
00:53 - and then you need to know how to use
00:55 - xcode as an application just like
00:58 - Photoshop or any other application on
01:01 - your computer you need to know how to
01:02 - navigate around the app and where all
01:04 - the menus are and and stuff like that
01:06 - but Objective C really is the
01:08 - programming language that you will be
01:10 - using to build your iPhone apps all
01:12 - right so let's just dive in and create a
01:14 - brand new xcode project and see how that
01:16 - works okay so if you haven't gotten
01:19 - xcode for your Mac already you can just
01:22 - go to the Mac App Store and you can
01:26 - search for xcode and you'll be able to
01:28 - download it for free keep in mind it's a
01:30 - pretty hefty download at 1.65 gigs so it
01:33 - you might have to wait a little while
01:35 - until you get it okay so once you've got
01:37 - xco downloaded from the Mac App Store
01:39 - you can go ahead and launch
01:44 - it and you're probably going to get this
01:47 - pop up as well welcome to xcode you can
01:49 - go ahead and create a new project by
01:52 - clicking this button if you don't get
01:54 - this welcome screen you can always go up
01:56 - to
01:57 - file um new and create a new
02:00 - project you'll arrive at the same screen
02:03 - here so you want to make sure that on
02:06 - the left hand side under this menu you
02:09 - want to select application from under
02:11 - the iOS heading because that's the
02:13 - operating system we're developing for
02:16 - and you want to create a single View
02:18 - application um which is just going to be
02:21 - the blank application that we're going
02:22 - to create right now so go next and you
02:27 - probably won't have the organization
02:29 - name and come identifier filled in but
02:32 - um for right now you can fill in
02:34 - anything you want there I'm just going
02:35 - to type in blank
02:38 - demo and hit
02:40 - next and then save it somewhere I would
02:43 - recommend that you create uh a folder
02:46 - for all of your xcode projects and just
02:49 - to keep things
02:52 - organized so go ahead and create it now
02:56 - all I want you to do is go up into the
02:58 - upper leftand corner and hit
03:01 - run and what happens is that xcode is
03:04 - going to compile your project and then
03:07 - it's going to open the iPhone simulator
03:09 - and run your application on it now this
03:12 - is why you don't even need a device to
03:13 - start building iPhone apps because xcode
03:16 - comes with a great um iPhone simulator
03:19 - and you can run your applications you
03:20 - can use GPS and you can you can do shake
03:24 - and you know any any sort of gestures
03:26 - and stuff that you'd want to do you can
03:28 - also choose a different iPhone so they
03:31 - have uh this this one's the iPhone 5 and
03:33 - then this one's like the 4S the retina
03:36 - 3o you can even do iPad simulator if
03:39 - you're going to build an iPad
03:40 - application now don't be alarmed if the
03:43 - simulator that popped up on your screen
03:45 - doesn't look like this because there are
03:46 - different sizes that you can do so you
03:49 - see I can change the size and some of
03:51 - them wouldn't uh don't have the frame so
03:53 - as you can see it's a blank screen
03:55 - because we haven't added any code to our
03:57 - application yet it's just showing the
03:59 - default view that the default xcode
04:02 - project has when you create a brand new
04:04 - project hit stop here to stop running
04:07 - the application in the simulator so
04:09 - there you have it you've compiled and
04:11 - you've run your first iPhone application
04:13 - and although it's not much we haven't
04:15 - added anything to it that's generally
04:18 - the process we're going to edit these
04:19 - files we're going to add code and then
04:21 - we're going to test our application on
04:23 - this simulator as we go along and once
04:25 - we have it done and we've got the app
04:27 - the way we want it we can actually
04:28 - deploy it onto a real phone and that's
04:30 - when it gets really exciting because you
04:32 - can start to show your application to
04:33 - people you can bring your phone around
04:35 - so stick around and I'll show you guys
04:37 - how to add things on the screen and
04:38 - handle user interaction
