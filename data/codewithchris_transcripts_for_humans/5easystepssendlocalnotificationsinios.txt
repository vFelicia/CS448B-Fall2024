00:00 - Haeckel crew today I'm going to show you
00:02 - how your app can show notifications to
00:04 - the user even if the user isn't using
00:08 - your app now this is perfect for apps
00:10 - like timers or alarms and to top it off
00:12 - it's actually really easy to do but
00:15 - before we dive in for all of you new
00:16 - viewers welcome to code with Chris the
00:18 - place to be if you want to learn how to
00:20 - make an app I'm Chris and today I'm
00:22 - going to show you how to do local
00:23 - notifications and five easy steps now
00:25 - there's one thing I need to tell you
00:27 - that there are two types of
00:29 - notifications the first one is local
00:31 - notifications which are ones that your
00:34 - app schedules for things like to remind
00:37 - the user hey your event is in 15 minutes
00:40 - or hey your alarm is ringing you should
00:43 - really wake up and this is what you're
00:45 - going to learn to do today now the
00:47 - second type of notifications are called
00:49 - push notifications also known as remote
00:51 - notifications and that's because it
00:53 - requires a remote computer to determine
00:56 - when and what to send and it's going to
00:58 - push these notifications to all of the
01:00 - devices that are registered to receive
01:02 - it so for example if you get a like on
01:05 - your Instagram photo or apply on your
01:07 - tweet these sort of events aren't easily
01:10 - predictable and so your app won't be
01:13 - able to schedule a notification to show
01:15 - instead it takes a remote computer to
01:17 - figure out that that event has happened
01:19 - and then to push those notifications to
01:22 - the appropriate devices and oh yeah if
01:27 - you're interested to learn how to do
01:29 - push notifications just drop me a quick
01:30 - comment below now back to the local user
01:33 - notifications we're going to do it in
01:35 - five easy steps the first step is to ask
01:37 - the user for permission we're going to
01:39 - do this using the UN user notification
01:42 - center class and think of this as the
01:45 - brains or the coordinators of this whole
01:47 - shindig now I've got a brand new Xcode
01:50 - project right here and we're going to
01:52 - write all of this code in the
01:53 - viewdidload function which is going to
01:55 - get fired when the app launches this
01:57 - isn't where you necessarily want to
01:59 - write this code in your own app but it's
02:02 - convenient for us for this demo because
02:04 - this function gets called as soon as the
02:06 - app is loaded so we're going to be
02:07 - writing our code here now the first
02:09 - thing you want to do is to import
02:12 - user notifications and that's going to
02:15 - give us access to all of the classes
02:16 - that we need we're going to first get a
02:19 - reference to the Notification Center so
02:22 - we're gonna say let's enter equals UN
02:24 - user Notification Center dot current and
02:28 - then we are going to call the request
02:31 - authorization method right here and
02:34 - there are a couple of different options
02:36 - you can ask for so we can ask for
02:40 - for example alert we can ask to play a
02:44 - sound as well and this completion
02:48 - handler is called after the user replies
02:51 - that basically a dialog is going to pop
02:53 - up and they're going to say deny or
02:55 - allow and the result is going to come
02:57 - back here
02:58 - so this first a parameter is going to
03:02 - let you know whether they granted access
03:03 - to it or not
03:04 - so let's call this granted and this
03:08 - second parameter is for any errors that
03:10 - might have occurred we're going to write
03:12 - error so in here you might want to just
03:15 - say you might want to write some code
03:17 - where if they granted permission then
03:20 - you might not do anything but if they
03:21 - deny permission then you might want to
03:23 - just tell them that if they want to
03:25 - enable it in the future they can go into
03:27 - the settings screen and they can enable
03:30 - it from there so that's something that
03:31 - you can do before this demo I'm going to
03:34 - assume that the user has allowed
03:35 - permission in step two we're going to
03:38 - create the contents of the notification
03:40 - and we're going to do this using the UN
03:42 - mutable notification content class let's
03:46 - create a UN mutable notification content
03:49 - object now we're going to assign it to
03:51 - content UN mutable notification content
03:56 - and then we're going to set two
03:58 - properties of this new object one is
04:02 - title oops
04:04 - I'm going to say hey I'm a notification
04:10 - and then we also have a body
04:16 - I can't type all right and step three
04:22 - we're going to specify when this user
04:24 - notification should show there are
04:27 - different types of triggers but today
04:29 - we're going to be showing a date and
04:31 - time based one so we're going to be
04:32 - using the UN calendar notification
04:35 - trigger class we're going to make the
04:38 - notification trigger five seconds from
04:40 - now so we're going to get the current
04:41 - date and time and then we're going to
04:44 - call a ding time interval and pass in
04:50 - five seconds
04:51 - let's assign this to a constant called
04:53 - date and we're going to need to break
04:56 - this date up into its components because
04:58 - when we create the UN calendar
05:01 - notification trigger that's the type of
05:03 - parameter it accepts so let's create a
05:08 - new constant called date components and
05:11 - we're going to use calendar dot current
05:15 - date components and we're going to be
05:19 - able to wait this one and we're going to
05:23 - be able to pass in a date specify which
05:25 - components we want and we're going to
05:27 - get those date components back so let's
05:30 - specify a set of date components I'm
05:32 - going to basically want everything so I
05:35 - want the year the month a day the hour
05:41 - the minute and the second and then we're
05:45 - going to pass in our future date as the
05:48 - date so now that we have the components
05:51 - we're going to create the UN calendar
05:53 - notification trigger object and it has
05:58 - an initializer where we can pass in the
06:01 - date components and whether or not it
06:03 - repeats so we're just going to pass in
06:05 - those date components that we broke up
06:07 - and we're going to say false for repeats
06:09 - and finally let's assign this object
06:13 - into a constant called trigger and it's
06:16 - that for we're going to create a request
06:18 - which encapsulate sort contains the
06:20 - notification contents and trigger and
06:23 - kind of packages up into one object now
06:27 - we're going to create the request
06:29 - and we're gonna be using the UN
06:31 - notification request class and it's got
06:35 - this sort of initialization method here
06:38 - where we can pass in an identifier for
06:40 - the request the content which we have
06:42 - and the trigger which we also have so
06:45 - we're going to need to create some sort
06:47 - of ID so we're just going to do this
06:49 - right above it and we're going to say
06:52 - let you UID string equals u u ID dot u u
06:57 - ID string and this is going to give us a
06:59 - unique identifier which we can pass in
07:02 - right there content is going to be
07:05 - content from right up here and trigger
07:07 - is going to be this guy right here
07:11 - so finally let's assign this into just
07:14 - call this request and finally step five
07:19 - where we register that request with
07:22 - Notification Center and remember because
07:24 - this request contains the trigger and
07:26 - the contents of the notification the
07:28 - Notification Center will know exactly
07:30 - what to show and want to show it now
07:32 - we're going to register the request with
07:35 - Notification Center so up here in step
07:37 - one we already had a reference to
07:40 - Notification Center with this constant
07:43 - right here so we are all set to use that
07:45 - down here so we're going to say Center
07:47 - dot ad and you can see here we can pass
07:52 - in the request and we have a completion
07:54 - handler just in case there is an error
07:57 - so we're gonna pass in the request we're
08:00 - going to double click this closure to
08:01 - open it up we're gonna sign the air
08:03 - parameter in there and inside here we
08:06 - would basically check the error
08:10 - parameter for or n handle and errors so
08:17 - let's go ahead and run this and try it
08:18 - out
08:24 - so you can see here it asks me for
08:27 - permission I'm gonna say it Lao and then
08:30 - I'm going to get out of here and we
08:33 - actually might have passed the five
08:35 - seconds already so let me run that again
08:37 - should I set it to ten seconds so you
08:45 - can see that and now a question for you
08:48 - would you like to see a tutorial on push
08:51 - notifications let me know by leaving a
