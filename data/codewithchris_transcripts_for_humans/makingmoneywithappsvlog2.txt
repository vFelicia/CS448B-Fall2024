00:00 - in this Vlog I talked about which app we 
decided to start building what our initial  
00:04 - marketing strategy will be and how I'm scoping 
out competitor apps now if you're brand new to  
00:09 - this series welcome this is a raw and unscripted 
video format where I share the Journey of our team  
00:15 - trying to build apps for profit and this entry is 
dated September 28th 2023 it's about 2 weeks since  
00:22 - our last uh Vlog entry and if you missed that 
first one click on right over here by the way  
00:28 - to everyone who watched that and commented that 
they didn't mind this sort of raw format uh thank  
00:33 - you so much for that it's really encouraging for 
me to hear with that said I hope you enjoy this  
00:38 - Vlog hey it's Chris here so I want to give you 
an update on how this project has been going so  
00:46 - I have presented the idea to our team about this 
and it's the same thing I told you in Dev Vlog one  
00:52 - what the idea is and I told the team to go ahead 
and start brainstorming some ideas about technical  
01:00 - challenges about gamification ideas and just 
anything freefor all let's just brainstorm and  
01:07 - get some thoughts on the page and we work better 
offline and so we didn't hold a meeting and have  
01:15 - everyone brainstormed together like that we just 
did it asynchronously and had everyone think about  
01:22 - it and then contribute and update this document 
here are some of the things that came up some  
01:28 - technical challenges on uh proposed database 
architecture pros and cons of that stuff uh  
01:35 - potentially what we might do in terms of uh how to 
analyze the data using AI to reveal those insights  
01:41 - to the user uh some gamification proposals on 
how to make it motivating for users to continue  
01:49 - using these apps and some monetization options so 
all of these are just ideas nothing set in stone  
01:55 - the other thing that I started doing was to learn 
about the business side of apps because we focus  
02:01 - mostly on development and coding that's that we 
have that down pat but we don't know the other  
02:06 - side about how to Smart efficiently and smartly 
grow apps and monetize them and make money with  
02:13 - them so one of my favorite places to do to learn 
that sort of stuff is with Steve Young at ATMs and  
02:19 - the reason for this is because he backs up all 
of his claims with data slides numbers that's  
02:26 - what I've noticed about his videos and I think 
they're more concrete than someone just saying  
02:32 - you should do this you should do that and the 
reason he has that data is because he runs an  
02:37 - agency that helps other people grow their apps so 
he's constantly testing things and figuring out  
02:45 - what works and then he shares those learnings 
through ATMs and he also interviews a lot of  
02:53 - other industry experts so anyways what I've been 
doing is watching select videos and I've also been  
03:01 - taking notes so I will share these with you um 
so far I've watched two of his videos and I'm  
03:07 - I'm trying to um really absorb the information 
so I'm taking notes and by watching a bunch of  
03:14 - these videos I can then take a look at these 
notes and formulate a marketing plan for our  
03:21 - app so that's what my plan is so I'm learning a 
ton with watching every video I'll share these  
03:26 - notes with you don't worry uh the other thing 
that we have done since the last devlog is to  
03:34 - figure out what app to build first now I didn't 
want to choose a heavier app because I want to  
03:41 - get some quick wins under the belt so I wanted 
to go with something quick and easy that we can  
03:47 - actually launch the worst thing is trying to build 
a sleep tracker because even if it there's an MVP  
03:55 - with the sleep tracker the concept of tracking 
sleep I think is much harder than let's say a  
04:01 - mood Tracker Where the user launches the app and 
enters in how they're feeling so that ultimately  
04:08 - is what we chose because like I said a I think 
it can be done pretty quickly so that we can  
04:13 - get a quick win and some quick experience under 
a belt number two is that a lot of the elements  
04:20 - from this app I think are applicable and reusable 
for other apps for example looking at a calendar  
04:26 - and seeing historically what you've logged that 
calendar can be turned into a reusable component  
04:34 - for let's say a sleep tracker where you would also 
want to look at a calendar historical data and see  
04:41 - how many hours you've slept for example so this is 
the first app we are tackling and the other thing  
04:48 - that drove this decision not just the things that 
I talked about was doing app keyword research now  
04:54 - let me talk about this for a second like I said 
I think app marketing and the business side of  
05:00 - things it's so important because if we build an 
amazing app it looks and feels great if no one  
05:06 - knows about it then it's pointless so I think 
the marketing aspect is very important so there  
05:12 - are multiple ways to go about it right there are 
paid ways such as paying for Apple search ads or  
05:19 - paying for at Facebook ads or whatever to drive 
downloads and installations but obviously that  
05:25 - costs a lot of upfront capital and well not 
a lot but it does cost some upfront capital  
05:31 - and I'm more of a risk adverse person and how I 
built code with Chris was through organic search  
05:40 - so that is writing articles targeting specific 
keywords to rank for those keywords in Google  
05:47 - and then when people search it they'll find my 
article and they will uh click it so SEO basically  
05:53 - there is the same sort of thing for for apps so 
when someone is searching for an app in the the  
05:59 - App Store let's say they search mood tracker 
you want your app to pop up right and so there  
06:07 - was a very interesting video from Steve talking 
about I think it this video if you search it and  
06:14 - it's something like in the first five minutes he 
starts talking about a strategy for a couple of  
06:21 - his apps where he did no paid marketing he only 
targeted specific low competition keywords that  
06:30 - all of the big companies are not targeting so 
the big companies headspace for the meditation  
06:36 - app right headspace they're probably targeting 
terms like like meditation and uh focus and  
06:44 - what is some mindfulness and things like that 
right those generic Big Lots of search traffic  
06:50 - keywords they're not optimizing for the lower 
traffic keywords because it's just not worth it  
06:57 - for them you have a limited amount of space space 
in your app store metadata to include information  
07:03 - so they're going to Target the juiciest keywords 
because they have that authority to rank for those  
07:07 - High competition keywords so this strategy that 
Steve is talking about here is about identifying  
07:14 - those low competition keywords because it's low 
competition your app should be able to rank for  
07:19 - it pretty highly and it will still bring you 
some free traffic that you don't have to pay  
07:24 - for so he was showing what was inspiring was he 
was showing a couple of his apps that get about  
07:32 - a 100 downloads a day and it's making almost 
$10,000 I think the app number two is actually  
07:38 - making $10,000 with 100 downloads a day so then 
he goes through this this process of identifying  
07:44 - these low competition keywords so using App 
follow a free account by the way so they have  
07:51 - paid accounts but using a free account an app 
follow and a free account in Mobile action so I  
07:56 - signed up for both of these services for free and 
I figured out a couple of these keywords here for  
08:05 - mood tracking and emotion tracking which is what 
we're doing I figured out about four but he says  
08:10 - you only need two so what we're looking for is 
a combined traffic number of 50 and a difficulty  
08:18 - around 30 30 to 50 so hopefully this works I've 
never done this before but there are people in  
08:29 - the comments of the video saying that this worked 
for them so I want to give this a try so that's my  
08:34 - first marketing strategy for the app is to go for 
low competition organic keywords and so I'm using  
08:42 - these two tools I'll show you in a sec what I did 
um it's pretty simple actually I'll show you how  
08:48 - what that keyword process looks like so I looked 
for keywords for a bunch of different apps and  
08:55 - because I was able to identify what looked it's 
like some good keywords for this mood Tracker app  
09:02 - I decided to go with this as a first app for us 
to do uh so that was another driving reason okay  
09:10 - so let me show you how you look for keywords so 
in app follow if you go to yeah if you go to ASO  
09:19 - tools here and you go to keyword live ranking you 
can type in whatever let's say I'll just use what  
09:27 - I used and what this does it it is it pulls up all 
of the search results in the App Store the US app  
09:34 - store for that keyword so this would be equivalent 
to you typing in mood tracker in the app store app  
09:41 - on your phone these are the results and what 
you're looking for is an app that doesn't have  
09:47 - too many reviews because you won't have that many 
reviews in the beginning so something like this  
09:56 - one has 100 and something you could search for one 
that has has a 500 something I don't I didn't pay  
10:02 - too much attention to that I actually just grabbed 
one of these so what you want to do when you've  
10:06 - targeted an app is let's just haveit tracker it 
doesn't make sense let's just click this one mood  
10:12 - light daily mood tracker so you click this little 
keyword recommendations button and it is going to  
10:19 - take a look at what keywords this app is using a 
ranking for it then you want to sort by popularity  
10:26 - and you want to scroll down and and look for 
an interesting keyword that uh is around the  
10:34 - 30 range to 20 range uh that you want to look 
into how competitive it might be so let's say
10:43 - um let's say this one mental health Journal so 
what you want to do then is take this keyword  
10:54 - I'll just remember mental health Journal you 
go into Mobile action uh under ASO you go to  
11:00 - keyword tracking and it makes you choose an app 
when you create this account so by default it's  
11:06 - calm that's why you see that there and then you 
click into this keyword research Tab and you  
11:12 - type in mental health journal and this tool 
will tell you about that keyword here it is  
11:23 - search suggestions I'm going to click that and it 
adds it down here and then you can see the search  
11:27 - score is 23 and the the difficulty is 40 so that 
seems a bit High search score is 23 so those are  
11:37 - the numbers here this is the search score this 
is the difficulty and then you just repeat this  
11:42 - process until you find um at least two keywords 
where the traffic adds up to 50 and the difficulty  
11:48 - is like around 30 hopefully not too high um yeah 
that's it these tools are crazy because there's so  
11:59 - many features it's really easy to get lost in 
uh I felt lost in it and I had to poke around  
12:05 - to really figure out where I can get these uh 
metrics for keywords yeah so that's how you do  
12:13 - the keyword research okay the other thing that 
I've done is to after we decided we were going  
12:20 - to go down this path I went to the App Store and 
I punched in a couple of these keywords I think  
12:25 - I'm going to use a daily mood tracker and emot 
tracker I forget exactly maybe Mo tracker and  
12:35 - yeah I don't remember exactly which two but I 
punched the keyword into my phone app store and  
12:42 - I downloaded a bunch of apps that I thought were 
interesting now I haven't gone through them all  
12:48 - my intention is to launch each of them and jot 
down some thoughts and notes and just to see if  
12:53 - I can see any patterns about how these apps work 
and what is good and what is not so when I was  
12:58 - scrolling through that those search results I 
noticed that there were apps that were created  
13:03 - by individual people as well how do I know that 
because the on the publisher field it's like a  
13:09 - personal name it's not a company name so I thought 
that was really good because that means that it's  
13:15 - not too difficult to rank for that being a 
personal Indie developer you can still have  
13:20 - your app show up in the search results for the 
keywords that I'm looking for so at the bottom  
13:25 - of the document I know this is like a not very 
or ganized document but it's like a brain dump  
13:31 - it's a shared notepad essentially right now so I 
I I was launching the apps I was just taking notes  
13:39 - on what I see what features there are what you can 
do in the apps what is the monetization model what  
13:45 - are their pricing tiers what do you get for it 
things like that and also some of my thoughts so  
13:53 - I haven't done it with all the apps I downloaded 
I need to continue doing that and so even by this  
14:00 - small exercise each app takes me about maybe 10 
minutes to go through even just going through  
14:05 - these five or six apps I was able to start 
thinking about what our app would require and  
14:12 - so I started jotting down those notes as well keep 
in mind there's no wireframes right now there's no  
14:19 - there's nothing right now it's just trying to 
it's almost like a blob of clay by looking at  
14:25 - other people's apps in this category I'm starting 
to get ideas of what I would like for our version  
14:32 - of the app and obviously these apps are more full 
featured I don't want to launch with all of the  
14:38 - features because you know there's that concept of 
minimal viable product you want to launch quickly  
14:44 - and and start getting data and things like that 
so um I'm trying to really go with a slim down  
14:50 - feature set um and if I have ideas I really want 
to implement that seem a bit bigger I will Market  
14:59 - as let's leave it for phase two let's get this 
launched first so that it's usable and we can  
15:04 - start trying to rank this app and then later on 
build that feature so that's where we're at now  
15:13 - I want to show you one more thing because these 
apps I I mentioned this in the first video these  
15:20 - apps are not in Reinventing the wheel there's 
a ton of mood tracker apps there's a ton of  
15:27 - sleep tracker step tracker water tracker ton of 
these but the way you can stand out is you can  
15:33 - still do things a little differently right and 
here's one good example of this non boring apps
15:43 - calculator so this person has basically 
taken that concept so look at this this  
15:52 - is a basic calculator app that you have 
on your phone already you don't need a  
15:56 - calculator app but this one looks so so cool 
look at how exciting the numbers look and I  
16:03 - I don't remember if there's themes or 
not but I just I didn't download it it  
16:07 - does look like it has themes but wouldn't 
you rather use this so my point is it's  
16:13 - not all about the functionality and who has 
more features and whatnot look at this habit
16:19 - app pretty crazy look so it's just marking 
that you've done that habit and then I guess  
16:30 - you collect badges perhaps right it looks cool 
like even logging that you meditated looks cool  
16:38 - you hold the button and it's like charging 
energy and then it becomes done okay so that  
16:46 - look let's see it again boom done right just 
that would want to make you use this app more  
16:54 - than another app right so don't feel like 
you have to create this completely new app  
17:01 - idea don't feel like you need to like stuff 
it full of features and be have more features  
17:06 - than your competitors I don't think it's about 
that at least the way that I want to go about  
17:10 - it is to not focus on more features focus on 
less features but make each of those features  
17:17 - just a joy to use so that someone would choose 
your app over another anyways that's devlog 2  
17:23 - that's where we're at right now the next steps I 
think are to solidify the requirements that we'd  
17:31 - want for our app and then to start to draw some 
wireframes so that Jo Asen and Yaki who will be  
17:40 - executing on the development will have something 
that so that they can start basically this is  
17:46 - just a bunch of rough ideas of requirements 
so it's not enough to go on okay hope that  
17:53 - was helpful again all of this progress that 
I've shared with you has literally happened  
17:58 - in the last week okay thanks for watching hope 
that was helpful I'll talk to you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

in this Vlog I talked about which app we decided to start building what our initial marketing strategy will be and how I'm scoping out competitor apps now if you're brand new to this series welcome this is a raw and unscripted video format where I share the Journey of our team trying to build apps for profit and this entry is dated September 28th 2023 it's about 2 weeks since our last uh Vlog entry and if you missed that first one click on right over here by the way to everyone who watched that and commented that they didn't mind this sort of raw format uh thank you so much for that it's really encouraging for me to hear with that said I hope you enjoy this Vlog hey it's Chris here so I want to give you an update on how this project has been going so I have presented the idea to our team about this and it's the same thing I told you in Dev Vlog one what the idea is and I told the team to go ahead and start brainstorming some ideas about technical challenges about gamification ideas and just anything freefor all let's just brainstorm and get some thoughts on the page and we work better offline and so we didn't hold a meeting and have everyone brainstormed together like that we just did it asynchronously and had everyone think about it and then contribute and update this document here are some of the things that came up some technical challenges on uh proposed database

lot of other industry experts so anyways what I've been doing is watching select videos and I've also been taking notes so I will share these with you um so far I've watched two of his videos and I'm I'm trying to um really absorb the information so I'm taking notes and by watching a bunch of these videos I can then take a look at these notes and formulate a marketing plan for our app so that's what my plan is so I'm learning a ton with watching every video I'll share these notes with you don't worry uh the other thing that we have done since the last devlog is to figure out what app to build first now I didn't want to choose a heavier app because I want to get some quick wins under the belt so I wanted to go with something quick and easy that we can actually launch the worst thing

almost like a blob of clay by looking at other people's apps in this category I'm starting to get ideas of what I would like for our version of the app and obviously these apps are more full featured I don't want to launch with all of the features because you know there's that concept of minimal viable product you want to launch quickly and and start getting data and things like that so um I'm trying to really go with a slim down feature set um and if I have ideas I really want to implement that seem a bit bigger I will Market as let's leave it for phase two let's get this launched first so that it's usable and we can start trying to rank this app and then later on build that feature so that's where we're at now I want to show you one more thing because these apps I I mentioned this in the first video these apps are not in Reinventing the wheel there's a ton of mood tracker apps there's a ton of sleep tracker step tracker water tracker ton of these but the way you can stand out is you can still do things a little differently right and here's one good example of this non boring apps calculator so this person has basically taken that concept so look at this this is a basic calculator app that you have on your phone already you don't need a calculator app but this one looks so so cool look at how exciting the numbers look and I I don't remember if there's themes or not but I just I didn't download it it does look like it has themes but wouldn't you rather use this so my point is it's not all about the functionality and who has more features and whatnot look at this habit app pretty crazy look so it's just marking that you've done that habit and then I guess you collect badges perhaps right it looks cool like even logging that you meditated looks cool you hold the button and it's like charging energy and then it becomes done okay so that look let's see it again boom done right just that would want to make you use this app more than another app right so don't feel like you have to create this completely new app idea don't feel like you need to like stuff it full of features and be have more features than your competitors I don't think it's about that at least the way that I want to go about it is to not focus on more features focus on less features but make each of those features just a joy to use so that someone would choose your app over another anyways that's devlog 2 that's where we're at right now the next steps I think are to solidify the requirements that we'd want for our app and then to start to draw some wireframes so that Jo Asen and Yaki who will be executing on the development will have something that so that they can start basically this is just a bunch of rough ideas of requirements so it's not enough to go on okay hope that was helpful again all of this progress that I've shared with you has literally happened in the last week okay thanks for watching hope that was helpful I'll talk to you guys next time
