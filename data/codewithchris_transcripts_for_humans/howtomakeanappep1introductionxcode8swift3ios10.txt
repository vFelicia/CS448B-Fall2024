00:07 - hello welcome to lesson one of how to
00:10 - make iphone apps with no programming
00:11 - experience in this lesson we're going to
00:14 - talk about the tools and materials that
00:16 - you need to start building apps I'm
00:18 - going to tell you about what these tools
00:20 - are where you can find them how they're
00:23 - going to be used in order to build an
00:25 - app and finally once you have your
00:27 - completed app how are you going to
00:28 - publish it into the Apple App Store okay
00:33 - now the only thing you really need is a
00:35 - Mac computer now at this point all of
00:37 - the PC users will turn away but before
00:40 - you do that give me a couple of minutes
00:41 - I'm going to tell you guys a solution
00:43 - that PC users can use but first let's
00:46 - talk about why we need a Mac the reason
00:48 - is the software that we use to build
00:51 - apps with only runs on Mac computers
00:53 - specifically the Mac operating system so
00:56 - the Mac computer that you get whether
00:58 - you borrow from a friend or you buy a
01:00 - secondhand just make sure that it can
01:02 - run the latest Mac operating system if
01:04 - you're buying a second-hand Mac this
01:07 - usually means that it's not more than
01:09 - say two years old and if you're buying a
01:12 - brand new Mac then even the lowest end
01:14 - Mac will suffice and usually that is the
01:17 - Mac Mini that's going to be fine for app
01:19 - development aside from a Mac computer
01:21 - that's all you really need the software
01:23 - I mentioned is free you don't even need
01:25 - an iPhone or an iPad to develop apps for
01:27 - it although they do come in handy when
01:30 - you want to test your app on an actual
01:31 - device another question I get often
01:34 - asked is if you can use an iPad or an
01:38 - iPhone for app development and
01:40 - unfortunately the answer is no because
01:42 - that software I mentioned where we write
01:45 - our code in to build apps it doesn't run
01:47 - on an iPad or an iPhone it actually
01:49 - needs a Mac computer with the Mac
01:51 - operating system okay so what is this
01:54 - magical software I'm talking about that
01:56 - we use to build apps with well it's
01:58 - called Xcode and it's available for free
02:00 - in the Mac App Store and if you get
02:03 - access to a Mac with the latest
02:04 - operating system you're going to see an
02:06 - app store installed there's going to be
02:08 - icon in the Applications folder where
02:10 - you can access kind of like an app store
02:13 - that's on your
02:13 - my pad or on your iPhone where you can
02:16 - search for Xcode and you can download it
02:18 - for free it is a pretty big download it
02:21 - usually requires the latest operating
02:23 - system in about 4 gigs of free space
02:25 - okay so for PC users or people who can't
02:29 - get access to a Mac what's the solution
02:31 - there well you could invest in a Mac or
02:34 - you can try out a service like Mac in
02:36 - cloud comm which allows you to rent a
02:39 - Mac and remotely log in to that Mac from
02:42 - your PC and it's somewhere around a
02:45 - dollar an hour or 20 dollars a month for
02:48 - unlimited usage keep in mind that these
02:50 - prices may have changed and I didn't go
02:52 - onto the website to verify them but if
02:54 - you don't already have access to a Mac
02:56 - it's still a pretty low cost investment
02:58 - to get your feet wet and get started and
03:00 - to see if app development is something
03:03 - that you want to pursue so what's going
03:05 - to happen is that on your PC desktop
03:08 - you're going to have a window of the Mac
03:10 - desktop and you're going to be able to
03:12 - access the Mac remotely through that and
03:15 - when I checked out Mac and cloud one
03:17 - cool thing about it was that Xcode has
03:19 - already pre-installed on it and it was
03:21 - ready to go because a lot of app
03:23 - developers use Mac and cloud or the
03:25 - purpose of building apps if they don't
03:28 - have a Mac or they can't get access to a
03:30 - Mac I do want to warn you however
03:32 - because you are accessing the Mac
03:35 - remotely through the internet there may
03:37 - be some lag depending on your internet
03:40 - connection and working through a remote
03:43 - desktop like that may be a little slower
03:46 - and more sluggish and generally not as
03:48 - good of an experience as if you were
03:51 - working off of an actual Mac in front of
03:53 - you ok now that we covered the first two
03:56 - points let's talk about how we're going
03:58 - to use Xcode to build apps now if you
04:01 - think about an app what it really boils
04:03 - down to are two things number one the
04:06 - user interface and this is what the user
04:08 - sees when they're holding the app on
04:10 - their phone or iPad and the second thing
04:13 - is that when the user interacts with
04:15 - that user interface there's some sort of
04:17 - response and there's some sort of logic
04:19 - that happens behind the scenes which
04:22 - either navigates to another screen or
04:23 - changes the information presented on the
04:26 - screen
04:27 - I'm going to call that the logic in
04:28 - response number two so how xcode helps
04:32 - you achieve those two things it has a
04:34 - visual layout editor where you can build
04:36 - your apps user interface visually by
04:39 - dragging and dropping elements onto the
04:41 - screen and secondly it has a code editor
04:44 - that lets you wire up code to those
04:47 - elements so that when the user interacts
04:49 - with the user interface the code that
04:51 - you write performs the logic and changes
04:54 - the layout and that's where the
04:56 - programming part of things comes in and
04:58 - lastly Xcode also has an iOS device
05:01 - simulator it has an iPhone simulator and
05:04 - iPad simulator for all of the different
05:07 - iPhones and iPads that are available so
05:10 - you can test your app on this simulator
05:12 - without actually needing or plugging in
05:14 - an actual device and what's going to
05:16 - happen when you run your Xcode project
05:18 - is that you're going to see an image of
05:21 - the device pop up on your screen with
05:24 - your app running inside of it and you
05:26 - can interact with it through that
05:28 - simulator using your mouse just as if
05:30 - you are tapping on the device so that's
05:32 - what Xcode is now the next thing that
05:34 - you have to learn in order to build apps
05:36 - is the Swift programming language now I
05:39 - mentioned in Xcode that you can write
05:41 - code to perform the logic and response
05:43 - when the user interacts with your user
05:45 - interface well that code follows a
05:47 - certain set of rules and syntax just
05:50 - like language like French or English and
05:53 - that programming language is called
05:56 - Swift now I just have to mention here
05:58 - that Swift isn't something that you have
06:01 - to download you have to download Xcode
06:03 - from the Mac App Store but Swift is just
06:06 - the language that you have to learn in
06:08 - order to write the code so you don't
06:09 - have to do anything to get Swift or you
06:12 - don't have to download Swift or anything
06:13 - like that now learning how to code in
06:15 - Swift is usually the most intimidating
06:17 - part for people but it's actually not
06:20 - that bad
06:20 - tons of people have gone through my
06:22 - tutorials and courses and successfully
06:24 - learned Swift and continue to build apps
06:26 - like with learning any brand new
06:28 - language practice is key and having
06:30 - someone like myself to guide them
06:32 - through it also helps a lot ok so now
06:35 - the last thing that cover is once that
06:37 - you have your app how are you going to
06:39 - get it into the App Store well
06:40 - Apple has a Developer Program that is a
06:43 - paid membership it's $99 US a year and
06:47 - what that allows you to do is to submit
06:50 - as many apps as you want into the App
06:53 - Store and offer your apps for sale or
06:56 - for free
06:57 - one thing that's changed however is that
06:59 - whether or not you're part of this
07:01 - program you can deploy your apps and
07:04 - deploy is just a fancy word for install
07:06 - you can install your apps that you
07:08 - create onto your own device without
07:11 - signing up for this membership in the
07:13 - past you had to pay that yearly fee in
07:15 - order to even get your apps onto a real
07:18 - device but that's not the case anymore
07:20 - aside from allowing you to submit apps
07:23 - into the App Store it also gives you
07:26 - access to the latest Apple software
07:29 - before it gets officially released so
07:31 - you can access their beta software
07:33 - that's another perk of the program okay
07:36 - so I hope this lesson was useful for you
07:38 - to understand what tools we need and how
07:41 - we're going to go about building apps in
07:43 - the next lesson I'm going to get you
07:45 - started right away into running Xcode
07:48 - and dabbling in some Swift code thanks
07:51 - for watching and I'll see you in the
07:52 - next lesson bye for now
07:57 - you
