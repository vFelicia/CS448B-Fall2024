00:02 - guys are in for a treat
00:03 - last week I got to speak with Steve
00:04 - Young from Matt masters coke and he took
00:06 - me on a behind-the-scenes step by step
00:08 - App Store optimization process for my
00:11 - app magic hat now the cool thing is that
00:13 - normally he charges his agency clients
00:15 - thousands of dollars to go through this
00:16 - process and you're gonna get to see all
00:19 - of this for free have you choose your
00:20 - keywords how you optimize your app store
00:22 - listing questions like doing keywords in
00:24 - the description matter the text on the
00:26 - screenshots matter things like that in
00:28 - addition to that he reveals some of his
00:30 - profitable marketing campaigns that he
00:33 - does for his clients and how to do them
00:35 - such as the paid to free campaign and
00:37 - the Apple feature and more so you're
00:39 - gonna get to learn all of that in the
00:41 - upcoming interview I hope you guys enjoy
00:43 - here we go hey guys what's up it's Chris
00:46 - here and I'm here today with a special
00:48 - guest my good friend Steve from at
00:50 - masters Co and he's here today to share
00:53 - with us some of the his insights and
00:55 - expertise on the magic hat app listening
00:59 - that we've been looking at that we've
01:00 - been updating and that we are almost
01:03 - ready to submit so we're gonna let Steve
01:06 - take it away here cool Chris well we
01:08 - could talk about all marketing
01:10 - strategies related so I just picked ASO
01:12 - because I felt when I looked at the app
01:14 - I thought it would be something that
01:16 - would be worthwhile for you but then we
01:19 - can get into some of the other details
01:20 - about like what else you can do besides
01:23 - just ASO sure yeah all right so for
01:27 - those who are welcome guys for those who
01:29 - aren't familiar ASO just means App Store
01:32 - optimization which is SEO for the App
01:34 - Store and essentially what I did here is
01:37 - I put this spreadsheet now this is a
01:38 - patented app master spreadsheet I know
01:42 - so you Chris you could share this with
01:45 - your audience later on but this
01:46 - spreadsheet is something we put together
01:48 - and walks you through all the different
01:50 - strategies that we've talked about on
01:51 - our YouTube channel and our blog as well
01:53 - but essentially what I try to do is
01:56 - compile a long list of keywords now for
01:58 - you Chris just for this demonstration I
02:00 - just put a few keywords so the first
02:03 - thing I did Chris was I actually went
02:04 - into a penny and I put in your app it's
02:08 - completely free I put in your app and in
02:10 - the keywords field I
02:13 - wanted to see which keywords you are
02:14 - currently ranking for so right now your
02:16 - top ranking keyword according to a penny
02:19 - is preschool speech and then peekaboo
02:21 - animals and so forth
02:23 - so you know I'm gonna be honest with you
02:25 - Chris not really they're not ranking
02:27 - really well right preschool speech is 71
02:30 - and then peekaboo animals is 116 so it's
02:33 - pretty low but what I did what was able
02:35 - what I was able to do because of this
02:37 - was like Oh peekaboo
02:38 - is obviously keywords that I I didn't
02:40 - think about so that I ended up throwing
02:42 - that keyword into this big old
02:43 - spreadsheet yeah okay
02:45 - so what we want to do is really compile
02:48 - a long list of keywords and also what I
02:50 - did was I did I just used the app store
02:52 - all right so everybody and then I put in
02:55 - I went to the app store and I put in
02:57 - peekaboo here's what I did right can you
03:00 - see that well Chris yeah okay cool so I
03:03 - just put in peekaboo and I let Apple
03:05 - tell me what it was Auto suggestion so a
03:07 - lot of these peekaboo related terms are
03:09 - because of what Apple said okay so I put
03:12 - in zebra and elephant because those are
03:14 - the first three animals that were given
03:16 - away for free so we have zebra elephant
03:18 - and parrot I put those in there and I
03:20 - thought about phonics related terms too
03:22 - so again I put phonics into the app
03:25 - store and then the phonics related terms
03:27 - are what Apple Auto suggested meaning
03:29 - there's pretty high decent traffic going
03:30 - for them or really relevant keywords and
03:32 - then everything else so I also I want to
03:35 - highlight this too Chris
03:36 - although there's not a lot of traffic
03:37 - volume for this but think outside the
03:40 - box this is inside the box I would say
03:42 - we're all inside the box we're thinking
03:44 - in the app store we're thinking directly
03:45 - related to what this app is about and
03:47 - then outside the box would be what other
03:50 - things would be people searching for
03:52 - so obviously Sesame Street but pretty
03:54 - competitive I thought Melissa and Doug I
03:56 - know we're both fathers it sounds like
03:57 - okay I got a lot of Melissa and Doug
03:59 - stuff so start thinking about different
04:01 - brand names that kids might be looking
04:03 - for her parents might be looking for ice
04:05 - that might have decent volume and low
04:07 - competition then it might be worth
04:10 - ranking for so with Melissa and Doug
04:12 - obviously the the search volume isn't
04:15 - high but what I love about these when
04:18 - you think outside the box is the
04:19 - competition is really really low so a
04:22 - lot of times when you start thinking
04:24 - outside the box you're gonna find some
04:26 - you're gonna
04:27 - like whoa really good call search
04:29 - traffic and very low competition you
04:32 - might be competing with one other app
04:33 - Sesame Street is a bad example because
04:35 - they've got ton of apps but you might
04:37 - find a brand name that hasn't really
04:38 - gone into the app space but has but
04:41 - people are searching for that brand name
04:42 - that's what we're looking for here okay
04:44 - and the traffic score on the leftmost
04:48 - column right there is that out of ten or
04:51 - five or yeah well so I'll go through
04:53 - this column stuff and this is the ASO
04:56 - exercise that we normally do for our
04:57 - clients but essentially once we compile
04:59 - these keywords we put them into our two
05:01 - favorite tools and what we found are the
05:03 - two most accurate tools so sensor tower
05:05 - and mobile action and I found that if
05:09 - you had to pick one so to the audience
05:10 - because we pay for both if you had to
05:12 - just pick one I would pick global action
05:13 - I found that to be the most accurate out
05:15 - of all the ones that I've tested out
05:17 - mm-hmm but I guess all relatively new
05:20 - sorry to interrupt but I I when I
05:23 - originally published this app I knew
05:26 - about app Annie and sensor tower but I
05:28 - never knew about mobile action yeah it
05:30 - wasn't until a lot of our a lot of
05:33 - people a lot of my friends started
05:35 - saying hey have you checked out mobile
05:36 - action it's pretty cool and it took like
05:38 - three or four different people we said
05:39 - have you checked out mobile I came for
05:41 - me like all right let me check out my
05:42 - blocking because I was like you man I
05:43 - was like oh it's only cents at our I'm
05:45 - just gonna check out since it timer
05:46 - right yeah so yeah feel free to
05:50 - interrupt anytime but the the traffic
05:52 - score it is out of ten and the higher
05:54 - the better
05:55 - all right difficulty it's out of ten
05:58 - again now you want the lower the better
05:59 - so low difficulty means okay there's a
06:02 - high likelihood that you're gonna rank
06:03 - search core same thing it's out of a
06:05 - hundred this time because mobile action
06:06 - goes twenty like down to five zero I've
06:09 - seen some zeros but zero all the way to
06:11 - 100 and then chance you want a high
06:14 - score so it's usually how the chance
06:19 - that you'll likely be ranking high for
06:21 - that term so 100% means all right
06:23 - there's good pretty good chance there
06:24 - wouldn't be top five for this particular
06:26 - term so you know when I was looking at
06:29 - your app it's like okay the first
06:30 - potential growth channel that I would
06:32 - look at is App Store optimization and
06:33 - that's why I put this spreadsheet
06:34 - together for you Chris and what I did
06:36 - was so you know the keyword length is
06:38 - just I have this
06:40 - here because you know with iOS 11 you're
06:43 - gonna be limited to 30 characters in the
06:45 - app name and then you have the subtitle
06:47 - which is index as well and then you have
06:48 - the keyword field and so whenever I'm
06:50 - like I've put it together I'm like oh I
06:52 - have four more characters left this
06:54 - field allows me to see which keywords
06:57 - have four characters than it might be
06:59 - looking for nicely and then number four
07:02 - the yeah go yeah for the viewers out
07:05 - there when they're compiling this list
07:07 - of keywords for their own app like how
07:10 - big of a list should they shoot for I
07:12 - would so I'll just tell you what I
07:15 - normally shoot for I try to get anywhere
07:18 - from 80 and sometimes you go all the way
07:20 - to 300 but I would say like 40 or 50 or
07:23 - good because that really makes you think
07:26 - through what else you can because we're
07:28 - not even gonna fill fulfill the 100
07:29 - characters all the characters I would
07:31 - say like when let's say 160 right just
07:34 - 30 30 and 100 with just these this lists
07:38 - mmm so we're not gonna fulfill at all
07:41 - and then I it's gonna force you to think
07:43 - outside the box so what I normally do
07:44 - Chris is I'll look at some of your
07:46 - competitors and I'll see which keywords
07:47 - are ranking well for and that only Spurs
07:49 - some thought about what other keywords
07:51 - might be able to target okay cool cool
07:54 - so the apps is just the number of apps
07:57 - ranked is your actual current keyword
07:59 - ranking for these particular keywords I
08:01 - see
08:01 - so normally if you were ranking really
08:03 - well I would sort this list and I would
08:05 - say okay well I don't want to lose this
08:07 - rank for Chris so let's see what the top
08:09 - ranking keywords are and then I would go
08:11 - into target is what I want to which
08:14 - keywords are one target so looking at
08:17 - this list Chris what I normally do is I
08:19 - I sort by chance just to see which
08:23 - keywords have the highest chance scores
08:26 - because I find that you know like mobile
08:28 - action is a little bit more accurate
08:29 - when it comes to difficulty and so what
08:32 - we find here is Picabo Wilde is pretty
08:35 - good and when I when you actually see
08:37 - that both keyword tools are telling you
08:40 - low competition and that's a keyword
08:42 - that we got to go after so for example
08:44 - what I'm really finding aren't there are
08:46 - two keywords that really stand out as a
08:48 - high chance for you to rank well Picabo
08:51 - Wilde and Animal Planet
08:54 - okay how how attached are you to the
08:59 - magic hat happening well it's kind of
09:02 - embedded into the app but not like I
09:06 - wouldn't say completely completely
09:08 - attached because it's not like I have a
09:10 - whole catalog or series of apps based on
09:12 - okay magic hat although that was kind of
09:15 - the eventual idea okay I want to hear
09:18 - what your thoughts are so if my thoughts
09:20 - would be if you're not completely
09:21 - attached to it then I might just because
09:24 - I want magic in there because you seem
09:26 - to like it I might put in magic so I'm
09:28 - putting in a new happening for you
09:30 - magic animal peekaboo or magic where's
09:39 - there's peekaboo animals right mmm
09:42 - I see that that kind of tells you a
09:45 - little more about what the app is about
09:47 - right tells you a little bit more about
09:49 - what the app is about and also has
09:51 - keywords that were really targeting
09:52 - mm-hmm right so it could be magic and
09:56 - well let's say you wanted to go is it
09:59 - gonna be all peekaboo type of apps yeah
10:01 - that was kind of the thought okay
10:03 - perfect I love it then so I'll do magic
10:05 - peekaboo and then wild animals or wild
10:10 - animal all right let's play that while
10:14 - animals put animals
10:15 - so what I'm doing here obviously is
10:17 - peekaboo wild I want that's the that
10:20 - becomes the keyword that we're targeting
10:21 - right it has a high likelihood that
10:24 - we're gonna rank well for it so I'm
10:26 - putting them together and I'm still
10:28 - having trying to stick to your brand of
10:29 - magic so magic pinky boom and now I'm
10:31 - going after this and now you see Animal
10:34 - Planet being one right so very here's
10:36 - another the way I would do this would be
10:39 - so there's a trick where if you repeat a
10:43 - keyword that you're really targeting mmm
10:46 - twice in the app name and in the
10:48 - subtitle for this is for iOS 11 now it
10:51 - tends to help you rank well for it so I
10:53 - might go like all right Animal Planet
10:58 - it's probably too specific because
11:01 - Animal Planet I think is a trademark
11:02 - might be a trademark term but something
11:04 - like this you know or
11:07 - I was trying to put like explore right
11:08 - like explore animal explore Animal
11:14 - Planet peekaboo something like that but
11:16 - essentially what I'm trying to do is
11:18 - have Animal Planet and then repeat
11:19 - peekaboo again because that's the
11:21 - keyword that I'm really trying to target
11:23 - right and is it something that you want
11:25 - to actively avoid trademarks I mean like
11:28 - Melissa and Doug or Animal Planet I
11:29 - don't want to kind of have that
11:32 - blatantly in my list thing or I don't
11:34 - want to blatantly have it for me
11:35 - personally so for example I I was
11:37 - ranking really well for another like
11:39 - very similar app of yours but it was a
11:41 - phonics app and I wanted to go hooked on
11:44 - phonics so I called it you know
11:47 - phonics ABC fun oh no phonics DJ or ABC
11:51 - phonics and then I said get kids hooked
11:53 - on alphabet sound now this is when we
11:55 - could go really long app names and so I
11:58 - still had hooked on phonics in the app
12:01 - name but they just weren't completely
12:03 - together I miss max them so kind of like
12:05 - this what I'm doing now is I don't want
12:07 - Animal Planet together because then
12:08 - people like Oh Amy I know what you're
12:10 - doing but I might try to weave it in so
12:13 - that it's in the same sentence on that
12:15 - face that's cool that it would still
12:17 - kind of rank for that even though the
12:20 - words aren't together yeah awesome so
12:23 - this gives us what we want peekaboo wild
12:26 - and then we have animal twice we have
12:28 - peekaboo twice and then we have Animal
12:29 - Planet together now we don't just for
12:32 - the list
12:32 - don't viewers listeners we don't need to
12:35 - repeat what we're going after
12:36 - so generally what I do in this target
12:38 - tab is I'll put in where I put so US
12:41 - title and then I'll put this in like US
12:44 - subtitle just so I know I can come back
12:46 - where these keywords ended up falling in
12:48 - and now you're not there we use this
12:50 - right so if I we wanted to use let's say
12:53 - I wanted to target Animal Jam I could
12:54 - just put jam on here in the keyword
12:58 - field right so now then I put us keyword
13:01 - hmm all right and then this is u.s.
13:04 - title
13:05 - so wherever it is now I want to go after
13:07 - ABC phonics so I would put ABC phonics
13:10 - in here and notice that I'm not putting
13:13 - one of the big newbie mistakes I made
13:15 - was I put spaces so I put like this
13:18 - this just just because I thought it
13:20 - looked cooler which is Jam comma space
13:23 - ABC don't do that just but Jam comma ABC
13:26 - comma phonics phrases like this one last
13:30 - point what I'm going after phrases
13:31 - there's I don't have data to tell you
13:33 - which way is right or not but I tend to
13:36 - just keep it together cuz I find that ok
13:37 - I'll just keep this together it's like I
13:40 - send Doug for example I'll just put
13:42 - together now one of the things that is
13:45 - not very intuitive about this and it's
13:48 - awesome that you're showing us this
13:49 - because if let's say I wanted to target
13:52 - animal jam and this kind of goes against
13:56 - SEO and even YouTube tags like I would
13:59 - literally put animal jam somewhere in my
14:01 - article or my video tag but in this list
14:04 - thing they're completely not together
14:06 - but it still work yes right right and if
14:10 - you wanted to get aggressive and this is
14:11 - just generally what I do because Animal
14:13 - Jam has a really high search score so
14:16 - when I see discrepancies like this like
14:18 - Animal Jam mobile action saying chant
14:20 - score is really high meaning low
14:22 - difficulty Center towers saying pretty
14:25 - high difficulty so Chris like anything
14:27 - that's highlighted this is my I what
14:29 - I've deemed what Steve Young is deemed
14:31 - to be low competition that's anything
14:32 - under 3/4 Center tower and anything
14:35 - above 70 on mobile action but when I
14:37 - let's say I want to get aggressive on
14:39 - this right so I'm gonna so the us app
14:42 - store actually indexes the Spanish
14:44 - Mexico localization meaning if you put
14:46 - English keywords in there you can rank
14:49 - well for them so this is a great example
14:51 - in a great segue if I wanted to rank
14:55 - really well for that term I would put
14:56 - this I would hide here and then I might
15:02 - get aggressive here too and I just put
15:04 - Animal Planet right because then most
15:09 - likely nobody's gonna see this unless
15:11 - you're in Mexico but in the US which a
15:15 - lot of people are targeting nobody's
15:17 - gonna see it right but you will help
15:19 - index so if I have like the same listen
15:22 - Doug I want to get aggressive with it
15:23 - which I wouldn't suggest we do it
15:25 - because but I would put that into I
15:28 - would repeat it in the app name or the
15:30 - subtitle
15:31 - of the Spanish Mexico localization now I
15:33 - don't have data to support this and I
15:35 - frankly don't care if I have ever get
15:37 - the data support things but it's
15:39 - essentially because I know the biggest
15:41 - weight from an algorithms perspective
15:43 - comes from the app name and the subtitle
15:45 - so I want the key words that are really
15:48 - targeting to be in the app name and
15:50 - subtitle and I don't you know like and
15:51 - so certain key words that I really
15:53 - really want to target but they might be
15:54 - you know trademarked or something I'll
15:57 - like like that I'll hide it in the
15:59 - Spanish Mexico localization and I'll
16:01 - just put them into the app name and the
16:02 - keywords because my thought process is
16:04 - Apple is saying alright us app name
16:07 - subtitle keywords that's the biggest
16:09 - weight and then Spanish Mexico app name
16:12 - subtitle keywords have the next that's
16:14 - what I'm thinking
16:15 - the algorithm is saying in terms of
16:16 - priority and while we're still on the
16:18 - ASO front is this kind of like a
16:20 - one-and-done deal or is this like a
16:23 - monitor edit take some out put anyone's
16:27 - in type of deal yeah the latter so do
16:30 - this first initial optimization and I'm
16:32 - pretty much guarantee you Chris and that
16:34 - if you follow this track then we will
16:35 - see an increase in downloads and then
16:38 - after that let's say like this would be
16:41 - a good example well let's say we went
16:43 - after pronounce and or no not maybe not
16:46 - pronounce that's not a good example but
16:47 - let's say we went after Animal Jam right
16:49 - we try to optimize it maybe you get a
16:51 - little bit more aggressive next time and
16:52 - you put it into the subtitle or maybe
16:55 - you even put it into the US app name but
16:57 - you're still like 30 your ranking 30
17:01 - that's the best you're gonna do so you
17:02 - try to optimize it because you know that
17:04 - one while mobile action says it's low
17:06 - competition since you're Thomas sensor
17:08 - tower saying it is very competitive
17:09 - keyword you're like I don't forget it so
17:11 - now you're gonna save it you're like I
17:13 - forget Jam I'm gonna remove it
17:14 - completely I'm gonna go after different
17:16 - keywords mmm because pronounce is decent
17:19 - right like there's actually good there's
17:22 - actually good like it's barely on the
17:25 - verge of being low competition sensor
17:27 - tower wise and I need 96 is a really
17:30 - high score so I would put that in there
17:32 - as well and you might reorganize it so
17:35 - after you do this optimization you're
17:36 - feeling Steve I'm I'm number 24
17:40 - pronounce your number 209 cuz it might
17:42 - be in the key word somewhere I'm number
17:44 - 20 now hold
17:45 - that's great now let's go after this so
17:47 - now this might be like pronounced animal
17:55 - sounds right right now you're like okay
18:00 - well Animal Planet where I'm worried
18:01 - ranking really high for it maybe I put
18:03 - it somewhere else something like this
18:07 - right this is a little bit too long but
18:09 - something like this okay I see just that
18:18 - but you know like this this might be
18:21 - actually a better way and then we go
18:22 - after Planet Animal Planet here one more
18:25 - thing about I just thought about
18:26 - description wise what about that
18:29 - so iOS duh they don't right now they
18:34 - don't really index the description I the
18:37 - results that we've been able to achieve
18:38 - for our clients so anywhere on average
18:40 - 50 really like 400% we been able to do
18:44 - it without touching the description oh
18:46 - wow yeah
18:47 - that's that's on iOS on Google Play it
18:50 - is really important so I would say pay
18:53 - attention to it like it especially for
18:55 - certain things that you're going after
18:56 - right here I'm sorry I looked at your
18:59 - description but things like pronounced
19:02 - you might want to put in there
19:03 - you know like fallen eggs you might want
19:06 - to start putting the keywords that we're
19:07 - targeting in there just because Apple is
19:10 - now starting to show signs that they're
19:13 - probably going to start indexing the
19:14 - description because right now we can
19:16 - update the description anytime we don't
19:18 - need a new build but we need a new build
19:20 - for app names of title and keywords but
19:23 - right in the future with iOS 11
19:25 - description is gonna be one of those
19:26 - things that you need an update for then
19:28 - the description might be a good place to
19:31 - write for the people who are potentially
19:34 - going to download the app right you're
19:35 - trying to entice them to go ahead and
19:37 - hit that download button yeah and
19:40 - screenshots - so what about text on the
19:43 - screen shots does that count for
19:44 - anything
19:45 - based on what experience I think it's
19:47 - very small like I think about the
19:49 - biggest in terms of I get these
19:50 - questions and that's a great question
19:51 - but I think it's it makes a slight
19:55 - different it's just one of these things
19:57 - that's like oh it's kind of
19:58 - nice to have when it's like I guess the
20:02 - best analogy would be steak if you're
20:03 - making a killer steak and you start with
20:04 - the great beef and the cut you're gonna
20:06 - have a killer steak long as you don't
20:08 - you're right and then if you add a
20:10 - little bit seasoning just adds a little
20:11 - bit more and that's what I would think
20:13 - of the words on your screen shots
20:15 - because Google did start saying that
20:17 - here we're gonna start indexing those
20:18 - words just because Google is like very
20:20 - advanced than Apple and I would say the
20:23 - biggest bang for your buck is gonna come
20:25 - from the app name and the subtitle and
20:27 - the keywords and all that it's awesome
20:28 - let's move on to the the next part then
20:31 - so one thing that looked at when I was
20:33 - looking at your app was you need some
20:35 - reviews right so even if you get some
20:38 - friends anybody yeah right you yourself
20:42 - I've seen a lot of people who really
20:43 - their own review but you want to get at
20:45 - least 5 in there because then it shows
20:48 - some rankings and because you talked a
20:50 - lot about development Chris you know
20:52 - there is a you probably know better what
20:54 - the right word is but a reviews API the
20:57 - Apple has and that has seen some really
20:59 - good results from people right and so I
21:02 - would put that in there where Apple has
21:04 - some limitations on how often you can
21:06 - show it but it does make it a lot easier
21:08 - for people to leave reviews because they
21:09 - don't have to leave the app store
21:10 - anymore they just put 5 stars hit submit
21:12 - you don't have to write a long a review
21:13 - so you will see an increase in reviews
21:15 - that way so that's one other thing that
21:18 - I would do I love your screenshots you
21:21 - know I love it I think the the things
21:23 - that I would change are probably I would
21:27 - probably show like some a little bit
21:31 - more of like maybe the text talked about
21:35 - make it a little bit bigger and talk
21:37 - more about like what the benefit would
21:39 - be to the parents so right now it looks
21:41 - like a screenshot of the main menu the
21:44 - first moon shot and then the second
21:45 - screenshot talks about like tap the Hat
21:47 - colorful it could be just screenshots
21:48 - that you're pulling from the app and
21:50 - which is fine but what I really loved
21:52 - about your app is the graphics are
21:54 - really well done and so I might move the
21:57 - zebra one to the second one and then
22:00 - make the text a little bit bigger be
22:02 - like word breakdown in pronunciation so
22:06 - that people can read it a little bit
22:07 - more but I would put that as a second
22:08 - one because you know as parents that's
22:10 - one will want to see good graphic
22:12 - because we want our kids to be engaged
22:14 - and - it's like what's the benefit of
22:16 - this app versus somebody else and I like
22:19 - the fact that you broke out those words
22:20 - that really spoke to me as a parent like
22:22 - oh that screenshot spoke to me out of
22:24 - the five so in the first screen shot I
22:27 - think is nice like boom you know kind of
22:29 - get sucked me into it
22:31 - and the second screenshot would be hey
22:33 - this is what we do this is why I work
22:35 - great and you might even lead with the
22:37 - first one I think it's strong enough to
22:39 - the zebra one is strong enough to be the
22:41 - first one to the next thing is so are
22:44 - there any paid it you know purchases in
22:46 - this it's just all completely free so
22:48 - you want people to buy the paid one yeah
22:50 - that was the idea because of the whole
22:52 - just paid like in-app purchases with
22:55 - parents you know and kids playing around
22:56 - with it yeah I don't know I don't have
22:59 - any data or any opinion on this I saw I
23:02 - opinion but I don't know how big data
23:04 - back it up and so usually I hesitate to
23:06 - say anything unless I have the data but
23:09 - I would think that it probably comforts
23:10 - better if you just had a net purchase in
23:13 - there you know people used to do this
23:15 - where they would have the light in the
23:18 - pro version and then they would try to
23:20 - cross-promote those two I think it works
23:23 - just fine - but I I think having the
23:26 - in-app purchases and the reason why I'm
23:29 - telling you to go that in a purchase
23:30 - route is it allows you to run this
23:32 - campaign that I love the most it's
23:34 - called the pay to free campaign and you
23:36 - can run this with your paid app but
23:38 - you're obviously not gonna make any
23:39 - money off of this but what I would say
23:41 - is you give three animals away for free
23:43 - maybe it's ten for another like pack you
23:47 - have packs different packs and then
23:49 - another package for all of them so you
23:52 - have like three different packages and
23:54 - then the what I would then do is make
23:58 - one of the first packs free maybe like
24:00 - your least performing pack make that
24:02 - memory get pressed for it on app advice
24:05 - and say hey Tyler I'm making this in-app
24:07 - free purchase free for a couple of days
24:09 - love for you to cover it he will cover
24:11 - it and if he doesn't you come back to me
24:13 - Chris because I got a good really good
24:14 - relationship with him but you will cover
24:16 - it and what we seen is that there's
24:19 - thousands of downloads that happen and
24:20 - you actually see an increase in in-app
24:22 - purchases for your other ones just by
24:24 - making that one free
24:25 - I see yeah so it's a really great
24:29 - campaign it's something you can run
24:30 - every quarter on what each every single
24:33 - app mm-hmm
24:34 - because Tyler doesn't want to cover too
24:36 - many at the same time all the time but I
24:38 - have a past client who does this every
24:42 - single week like if you see his if you
24:45 - go on a pin vise and you look at that
24:47 - you'll see his apps one of his apps cuz
24:49 - he's got a portfolio and Chris as you
24:51 - build up your portfolio you can start
24:53 - doing this every single week right
24:56 - because what happens is there's actually
24:58 - more downloads for your other apps too
25:00 - so there's this like natural organic
25:02 - cross-pollination where people check out
25:05 - your other apps and they see in a boost
25:07 - in downloads - yeah I mean that I always
25:11 - knew that was kind of like the endgame
25:13 - like you need a catalog of apps that you
25:14 - can cross promote and you can bundle and
25:17 - sell in bundles too so yeah I'm on a ped
25:19 - virus can free that's the one you're
25:23 - talking about yeah mm-hmm that's that's
25:26 - where you want to be because I've done
25:28 - that I've done some case studies where I
25:30 - say here's what happen to my apps when I
25:32 - pitch a device here's what happened when
25:34 - I just made it free and didn't tell
25:36 - anybody not even Chris and like the
25:39 - downloads was thirty thousand when app
25:40 - advice covered it and like two hundred
25:42 - went out the Vice didn't cover it and
25:45 - this is why I totally told you about the
25:47 - reviews because if you read through app
25:48 - advices policies they want you to have a
25:52 - few reviews like you have them average
25:54 - three star rating mm-hmm to be Mitch so
25:57 - you can actually do this on your paid
25:58 - version of magic hat and get some
26:01 - reviews you've got one right now but
26:02 - maybe get a few more and then like what
26:05 - I would do is just make it free for a
26:06 - little bit tell a few friends hey guys
26:07 - it's free can you please leave review I
26:09 - really need five to show up and then
26:11 - make it paid again and then pitch app
26:13 - advice and say hey Tyler I'm making this
26:15 - free free from tomorrow it's only free
26:18 - for a couple of days would love for you
26:19 - to cover it and then make it free get
26:24 - long as he covers it you'll get that
26:25 - boost in downloads and then make it paid
26:27 - right away like just make it free for a
26:29 - day make it paid again we did this for
26:31 - another client where his was twelve
26:33 - dollar app Chris but he did thirty
26:36 - thousand downloads Wow and then you mean
26:39 - extra thousand dollars just because we
26:42 - made it free for just one day that he
26:45 - ended up spiking the actual like Travel
26:47 - category I think it was that he made 27
26:49 - Travel category and I forget it was
26:51 - probably I think it is probably under
26:53 - the paid but then he got a lot more
26:55 - money because he hit that chart and the
26:58 - press came from people ended up buying
26:59 - it so he made $1000 she was pretty happy
27:01 - with that
27:01 - cool now looking at this I want to ask
27:04 - you you know percentage-wise if you had
27:07 - to focus your time would it be on ASL or
27:10 - would it be more on like marketing the
27:12 - app from external sources contacting
27:15 - press that sort of thing
27:17 - because it seems like there's a lot to
27:20 - do on that side more more so than that
27:22 - yeah so side right well I look at the
27:24 - app so if I look at first and foremost
27:28 - from an ESO perspective I know that's
27:30 - the it's controllable right if I do a
27:33 - little bit more homework if I put an
27:35 - effort Chris I can get you more
27:36 - downloads that's contributing more now
27:38 - PR I can put in the same down to effort
27:41 - I can do everything put so much passion
27:44 - into it but it's not controllable
27:46 - meaning I can still pitch that reporter
27:48 - and they'll be like oh great job Steve
27:50 - but they say no so what I found is PR
27:54 - when I think about that I don't focus
27:56 - too much on it anymore just because I
27:58 - haven't seen a huge amount of downloads
28:00 - coming from it now if you're thinking
28:03 - about like raising another round of
28:04 - funding or BD business development that
28:07 - is when PR would come into play but I
28:11 - would rather spend my energy on
28:13 - something that I can control and see the
28:15 - results and with PR you're just gonna
28:18 - kind of like amplify Stu but you're just
28:20 - gonna see a bump and then down right
28:22 - whereas ASO you see bump and then
28:26 - hopefully you optimize again you see
28:27 - bump and then you see more right so it
28:29 - becomes sustainable
28:31 - whereas PR just goes up it'll probably
28:32 - go higher than P then ASO but could come
28:35 - right back down - yeah it's like a quick
28:37 - win yeah it's like a vanity thing oh hey
28:40 - I was covered on all this stuff now for
28:42 - kids apps I would say it is nice because
28:44 - as parents
28:45 - look to these awards right for some
28:48 - reason I don't know if you feel this way
28:49 - for some reason the fact that they want
28:51 - some silly reward means something to me
28:53 - so I'm like okay it's worth checking out
28:54 - right it's like voted best mom app or
28:57 - whatever it is like okay let me try this
28:59 - app out and so with kids apps I might
29:02 - try to go like featured on Common Sense
29:04 - Media or iPhone mom loves it something
29:07 - like that just to say on the to help my
29:10 - ASO in my conversion just having a
29:13 - screen shot essentially
29:14 - the other thing I mean I focus on is
29:17 - Apple features so this is where I I like
29:19 - Apple I'll just think about this morning
29:21 - but if you think about PR you there's
29:24 - like so many publications that you have
29:25 - to reach out to right and you have to
29:27 - impress and get them to say yes right
29:29 - yeah and so with Apple it's like trying
29:34 - to date or just like finding the person
29:36 - that you love and just going so
29:38 - aggressive on her and trying to get her
29:40 - to say yes right with Apple like you can
29:43 - make that with PR like if you think
29:45 - about them side by side Apple I can try
29:47 - to woo her if I get her to war that's
29:49 - gonna me like millions and millions of
29:51 - downloads a romantic life long life a
29:54 - folded love but if I go PR it's just
29:57 - like was that was a great date but now
29:59 - you're gonna have to find the next PR
30:00 - provocation the next lady the next lady
30:02 - and so I rather focus my energy on
30:04 - pitching Apple and what I would do for
30:07 - you is it I think you had a great
30:08 - graphics is you know like do the go the
30:12 - normal process apps or promotion or App
30:14 - Store comm slash promote and then we did
30:17 - another video before where we try to
30:18 - figure out who the right app store
30:20 - manager is full at Apple to pitch and so
30:23 - if you tell that good story you just
30:25 - have to get one person to say yes and
30:27 - that would lead to tremendous amounts of
30:28 - downloads so I would go after that -
30:30 - because it doesn't hurt like there's no
30:32 - they can just say no and then what
30:34 - happens like nothing else you're you're
30:35 - back at where you normally were in is
30:37 - the App Store feature thing of only four
30:39 - new apps coming out like before you've
30:41 - published your app for usually four
30:43 - games there I think they're doing Apple
30:46 - is starting to highlight older games now
30:48 - but they all seem to be the same ones
30:50 - just like a different rotation like I've
30:52 - seen this Apple thank you but for kids
30:55 - apps or non games it's fine it's usually
30:58 - when
30:59 - you've got a good update or they it hits
31:02 - her radar
31:03 - it gets on their radar somehow and we
31:05 - got one of our clients we got featured
31:06 - it was a learn Chinese for kids like
31:08 - completely niche right Chris
31:10 - we got him featured by Apple and the in
31:12 - the US and I think of some other
31:14 - countries to be US and Canada maybe but
31:16 - essentially like I didn't think it would
31:17 - happen but we got it we help them get
31:19 - future and that sounds like an app that
31:21 - I need right now
31:22 - really right good yeah
31:27 - I've got a lot to go on Steve so I'm
31:30 - gonna put this into practice right away
31:31 - and we're going to submit this magic hat
31:35 - up in a couple of weeks so do you have
31:37 - any more words for the audience you have
31:39 - any closing words I would just say look
31:42 - there was a lot covered here start with
31:44 - the ASO I would say to try sign up for
31:47 - that mobile action I would just say
31:49 - start with that try to find these
31:50 - keywords that Kris and I have done where
31:53 - relevant to your app and low competition
31:55 - decent traffic and once you start at
31:58 - that and try to optimize its bits and
32:00 - pieces and you start getting the ball
32:01 - rolling a little bit then you're like
32:03 - home what else you know so get wet your
32:05 - appetite a little bit and just start
32:06 - with the ASO and then start thinking
32:07 - about what other channels you can you
32:09 - can work on cool and what if some people
32:12 - want to learn more about marketing ASO
32:15 - where can they find you or work and they
32:17 - learn more Chris I'm on YouTube - you're
32:19 - an inspiration to me man that's like
32:20 - holy cow I've liked your channel before
32:23 - you know I've actually heard people who
32:28 - came in is like I saw you and Chris no
32:30 - I'm so if you go to app master geo
32:32 - you'll find all the information I have a
32:34 - podcast that chris has been on I've got
32:36 - a YouTube channel and the blog tune I
32:37 - interview a bunch of guess that's how I
32:38 - got started in spaces I just started
32:40 - interviewing some of my heroes in space
32:41 - to really learn from them and then
32:43 - started using what they taught and then
32:45 - started teaching back and then modifying

33:05 - learn a lot from that okay so thanks so
33:07 - much Steve and I guess I will let you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up that's Chris here you guys are in for a treat last week I got to speak with Steve Young from Matt masters coke and he took me on a behindthescenes step by step App Store optimization process for my app magic hat now the cool thing is that normally he charges his agency clients thousands of dollars to go through this process and you're gonna get to see all of this for free have you choose your keywords how you optimize your app store listing questions like doing keywords in the description matter the text on the screenshots matter things like that in addition to that he reveals some of his profitable marketing campaigns that he does for his clients and how to do them such as the paid to free campaign and the Apple feature and more so you're gonna get to learn all of that in the upcoming interview I hope you guys enjoy here we go hey guys what's up it's Chris here and I'm here today with a special guest my good friend Steve from at masters Co and he's here today to share with us some of the his insights and expertise on the magic hat app listening that we've been looking at that we've been updating and that we are almost ready to submit so we're gonna let Steve take it away here cool Chris well we could talk about all marketing strategies related so I just picked ASO because I felt when I looked at the app I thought it would be something that would be worthwhile for you but then we can get into some of the other details about like what else you can do besides just ASO sure yeah all right so for those who are welcome guys for those who aren't familiar ASO just means App Store optimization which is SEO for the App Store and essentially what I did here is I put this spreadsheet now this is a patented app master spreadsheet I know so you Chris you could share this with your audience later on but this spreadsheet is something we put together and walks you through all the different strategies that we've talked about on our YouTube channel and our blog as well but essentially what I try to do is compile a long list of keywords now for you Chris just for this demonstration I just put a few keywords so the first thing I did Chris was I actually went into a penny and I put in your app it's completely free I put in your app and in the keywords field I wanted to see which keywords you are currently ranking for so right now your top ranking keyword according to a penny is preschool speech and then peekaboo animals and so forth so you know I'm gonna be honest with you Chris not really they're not ranking really well right preschool speech is 71 and then peekaboo animals is 116 so it's pretty low but what I did what was able what I was able to do because of this was like Oh peekaboo is obviously keywords that I I didn't think about so that I ended up throwing that keyword into this big old spreadsheet yeah okay so what we want to do is really compile a long list of keywords and also what I did was I did I just used the app store all right so everybody and then I put in I went to the app store and I put in peekaboo here's what I did right can you see that well Chris yeah okay cool so I just put in peekaboo and I let Apple tell me what it was Auto suggestion so a lot of these peekaboo related terms are because of what Apple said okay so I put in zebra and elephant because those are the first three animals that were given away for free so we have zebra elephant and parrot I put those in there and I thought about phonics related terms too so again I put phonics into the app store and then the phonics related terms are what Apple Auto suggested meaning there's pretty high decent traffic going for them or really relevant keywords and then everything else so I also I want to highlight this too Chris although there's not a lot of traffic volume for this but think outside the box this is inside the box I would say we're all inside the box we're thinking in the app store we're thinking directly related to what this app is about and then outside the box would be what other things would be people searching for so obviously Sesame Street but pretty competitive I thought Melissa and Doug I know we're both fathers it sounds like okay I got a lot of Melissa and Doug stuff so start thinking about different brand names that kids might be looking for her parents might be looking for ice that might have decent volume and low competition then it might be worth ranking for so with Melissa and Doug obviously the the search volume isn't high but what I love about these when you think outside the box is the competition is really really low so a lot of times when you start thinking outside the box you're gonna find some you're gonna like whoa really good call search traffic and very low competition you might be competing with one other app Sesame Street is a bad example because they've got ton of apps but you might find a brand name that hasn't really gone into the app space but has but people are searching for that brand name that's what we're looking for here okay and the traffic score on the leftmost column right there is that out of ten or five or yeah well so I'll go through this column stuff and this is the ASO exercise that we normally do for our clients but essentially once we compile these keywords we put them into our two favorite tools and what we found are the two most accurate tools so sensor tower and mobile action and I found that if you had to pick one so to the audience because we pay for both if you had to just pick one I would pick global action I found that to be the most accurate out of all the ones that I've tested out mmhmm but I guess all relatively new sorry to interrupt but I I when I originally published this app I knew about app Annie and sensor tower but I never knew about mobile action yeah it wasn't until a lot of our a lot of people a lot of my friends started saying hey have you checked out mobile action it's pretty cool and it took like three or four different people we said have you checked out mobile I came for me like all right let me check out my blocking because I was like you man I was like oh it's only cents at our I'm just gonna check out since it timer right yeah so yeah feel free to interrupt anytime but the the traffic score it is out of ten and the higher the better all right difficulty it's out of ten again now you want the lower the better so low difficulty means okay there's a high likelihood that you're gonna rank search core same thing it's out of a hundred this time because mobile action goes twenty like down to five zero I've seen some zeros but zero all the way to 100 and then chance you want a high score so it's usually how the chance that you'll likely be ranking high for that term so 100% means all right there's good pretty good chance there wouldn't be top five for this particular term so you know when I was looking at your app it's like okay the first potential growth channel that I would look at is App Store optimization and that's why I put this spreadsheet together for you Chris and what I did was so you know the keyword length is just I have this here because you know with iOS 11 you're gonna be limited to 30 characters in the app name and then you have the subtitle which is index as well and then you have the keyword field and so whenever I'm like I've put it together I'm like oh I have four more characters left this field allows me to see which keywords have four characters than it might be looking for nicely and then number four the yeah go yeah for the viewers out there when they're compiling this list of keywords for their own app like how big of a list should they shoot for I would so I'll just tell you what I normally shoot for I try to get anywhere from 80 and sometimes you go all the way to 300 but I would say like 40 or 50 or good because that really makes you think through what else you can because we're not even gonna fill fulfill the 100 characters all the characters I would say like when let's say 160 right just 30 30 and 100 with just these this lists mmm so we're not gonna fulfill at all and then I it's gonna force you to think outside the box so what I normally do Chris is I'll look at some of your competitors and I'll see which keywords are ranking well for and that only Spurs some thought about what other keywords might be able to target okay cool cool so the apps is just the number of apps ranked is your actual current keyword ranking for these particular keywords I see so normally if you were ranking really well I would sort this list and I would say okay well I don't want to lose this rank for Chris so let's see what the top ranking keywords are and then I would go into target is what I want to which keywords are one target so looking at this list Chris what I normally do is I I sort by chance just to see which keywords have the highest chance scores because I find that you know like mobile action is a little bit more accurate when it comes to difficulty and so what we find here is Picabo Wilde is pretty good and when I when you actually see that both keyword tools are telling you low competition and that's a keyword that we got to go after so for example what I'm really finding aren't there are two keywords that really stand out as a high chance for you to rank well Picabo Wilde and Animal Planet okay how how attached are you to the magic hat happening well it's kind of embedded into the app but not like I wouldn't say completely completely attached because it's not like I have a whole catalog or series of apps based on okay magic hat although that was kind of the eventual idea okay I want to hear what your thoughts are so if my thoughts would be if you're not completely attached to it then I might just because I want magic in there because you seem to like it I might put in magic so I'm putting in a new happening for you magic animal peekaboo or magic where's there's peekaboo animals right mmm I see that that kind of tells you a little more about what the app is about right tells you a little bit more about what the app is about and also has keywords that were really targeting mmhmm right so it could be magic and well let's say you wanted to go is it gonna be all peekaboo type of apps yeah that was kind of the thought okay perfect I love it then so I'll do magic peekaboo and then wild animals or wild animal all right let's play that while animals put animals so what I'm doing here obviously is peekaboo wild I want that's the that becomes the keyword that we're targeting right it has a high likelihood that we're gonna rank well for it so I'm putting them together and I'm still having trying to stick to your brand of magic so magic pinky boom and now I'm going after this and now you see Animal Planet being one right so very here's another the way I would do this would be so there's a trick where if you repeat a keyword that you're really targeting mmm twice in the app name and in the subtitle for this is for iOS 11 now it tends to help you rank well for it so I might go like all right Animal Planet it's probably too specific because Animal Planet I think is a trademark might be a trademark term but something like this you know or I was trying to put like explore right like explore animal explore Animal Planet peekaboo something like that but essentially what I'm trying to do is have Animal Planet and then repeat peekaboo again because that's the keyword that I'm really trying to target right and is it something that you want to actively avoid trademarks I mean like Melissa and Doug or Animal Planet I don't want to kind of have that blatantly in my list thing or I don't want to blatantly have it for me personally so for example I I was ranking really well for another like very similar app of yours but it was a phonics app and I wanted to go hooked on phonics so I called it you know phonics ABC fun oh no phonics DJ or ABC phonics and then I said get kids hooked on alphabet sound now this is when we could go really long app names and so I still had hooked on phonics in the app name but they just weren't completely together I miss max them so kind of like this what I'm doing now is I don't want Animal Planet together because then people like Oh Amy I know what you're doing but I might try to weave it in so that it's in the same sentence on that face that's cool that it would still kind of rank for that even though the words aren't together yeah awesome so this gives us what we want peekaboo wild and then we have animal twice we have peekaboo twice and then we have Animal Planet together now we don't just for the list don't viewers listeners we don't need to repeat what we're going after so generally what I do in this target tab is I'll put in where I put so US title and then I'll put this in like US subtitle just so I know I can come back where these keywords ended up falling in and now you're not there we use this right so if I we wanted to use let's say I wanted to target Animal Jam I could just put jam on here in the keyword field right so now then I put us keyword hmm all right and then this is u.s. title so wherever it is now I want to go after ABC phonics so I would put ABC phonics in here and notice that I'm not putting one of the big newbie mistakes I made was I put spaces so I put like this this just just because I thought it looked cooler which is Jam comma space ABC don't do that just but Jam comma ABC comma phonics phrases like this one last point what I'm going after phrases there's I don't have data to tell you which way is right or not but I tend to just keep it together cuz I find that ok I'll just keep this together it's like I send Doug for example I'll just put together now one of the things that is not very intuitive about this and it's awesome that you're showing us this because if let's say I wanted to target animal jam and this kind of goes against SEO and even YouTube tags like I would literally put animal jam somewhere in my article or my video tag but in this list thing they're completely not together but it still work yes right right and if you wanted to get aggressive and this is just generally what I do because Animal Jam has a really high search score so when I see discrepancies like this like Animal Jam mobile action saying chant score is really high meaning low difficulty Center towers saying pretty high difficulty so Chris like anything that's highlighted this is my I what I've deemed what Steve Young is deemed to be low competition that's anything under 3/4 Center tower and anything above 70 on mobile action but when I let's say I want to get aggressive on this right so I'm gonna so the us app store actually indexes the Spanish Mexico localization meaning if you put English keywords in there you can rank well for them so this is a great example in a great segue if I wanted to rank really well for that term I would put this I would hide here and then I might get aggressive here too and I just put Animal Planet right because then most likely nobody's gonna see this unless you're in Mexico but in the US which a lot of people are targeting nobody's gonna see it right but you will help index so if I have like the same listen Doug I want to get aggressive with it which I wouldn't suggest we do it because but I would put that into I would repeat it in the app name or the subtitle of the Spanish Mexico localization now I don't have data to support this and I frankly don't care if I have ever get the data support things but it's essentially because I know the biggest weight from an algorithms perspective comes from the app name and the subtitle so I want the key words that are really targeting to be in the app name and subtitle and I don't you know like and so certain key words that I really really want to target but they might be you know trademarked or something I'll like like that I'll hide it in the Spanish Mexico localization and I'll just put them into the app name and the keywords because my thought process is Apple is saying alright us app name subtitle keywords that's the biggest weight and then Spanish Mexico app name subtitle keywords have the next that's what I'm thinking the algorithm is saying in terms of priority and while we're still on the ASO front is this kind of like a oneanddone deal or is this like a monitor edit take some out put anyone's in type of deal yeah the latter so do this first initial optimization and I'm pretty much guarantee you Chris and that if you follow this track then we will see an increase in downloads and then after that let's say like this would be a good example well let's say we went after pronounce and or no not maybe not pronounce that's not a good example but let's say we went after Animal Jam right we try to optimize it maybe you get a little bit more aggressive next time and you put it into the subtitle or maybe you even put it into the US app name but you're still like 30 your ranking 30 that's the best you're gonna do so you try to optimize it because you know that one while mobile action says it's low competition since you're Thomas sensor tower saying it is very competitive keyword you're like I don't forget it so now you're gonna save it you're like I forget Jam I'm gonna remove it completely I'm gonna go after different keywords mmm because pronounce is decent right like there's actually good there's actually good like it's barely on the verge of being low competition sensor tower wise and I need 96 is a really high score so I would put that in there as well and you might reorganize it so after you do this optimization you're feeling Steve I'm I'm number 24 pronounce your number 209 cuz it might be in the key word somewhere I'm number 20 now hold that's great now let's go after this so now this might be like pronounced animal sounds right right now you're like okay well Animal Planet where I'm worried ranking really high for it maybe I put it somewhere else something like this right this is a little bit too long but something like this okay I see just that but you know like this this might be actually a better way and then we go after Planet Animal Planet here one more thing about I just thought about description wise what about that so iOS duh they don't right now they don't really index the description I the results that we've been able to achieve for our clients so anywhere on average 50 really like 400% we been able to do it without touching the description oh wow yeah that's that's on iOS on Google Play it is really important so I would say pay attention to it like it especially for certain things that you're going after right here I'm sorry I looked at your description but things like pronounced you might want to put in there you know like fallen eggs you might want to start putting the keywords that we're targeting in there just because Apple is now starting to show signs that they're probably going to start indexing the description because right now we can update the description anytime we don't need a new build but we need a new build for app names of title and keywords but right in the future with iOS 11 description is gonna be one of those things that you need an update for then the description might be a good place to write for the people who are potentially going to download the app right you're trying to entice them to go ahead and hit that download button yeah and screenshots so what about text on the screen shots does that count for anything based on what experience I think it's very small like I think about the biggest in terms of I get these questions and that's a great question but I think it's it makes a slight different it's just one of these things that's like oh it's kind of nice to have when it's like I guess the best analogy would be steak if you're making a killer steak and you start with the great beef and the cut you're gonna have a killer steak long as you don't you're right and then if you add a little bit seasoning just adds a little bit more and that's what I would think of the words on your screen shots because Google did start saying that here we're gonna start indexing those words just because Google is like very advanced than Apple and I would say the biggest bang for your buck is gonna come from the app name and the subtitle and the keywords and all that it's awesome let's move on to the the next part then so one thing that looked at when I was looking at your app was you need some reviews right so even if you get some friends anybody yeah right you yourself I've seen a lot of people who really their own review but you want to get at least 5 in there because then it shows some rankings and because you talked a lot about development Chris you know there is a you probably know better what the right word is but a reviews API the Apple has and that has seen some really good results from people right and so I would put that in there where Apple has some limitations on how often you can show it but it does make it a lot easier for people to leave reviews because they don't have to leave the app store anymore they just put 5 stars hit submit you don't have to write a long a review so you will see an increase in reviews that way so that's one other thing that I would do I love your screenshots you know I love it I think the the things that I would change are probably I would probably show like some a little bit more of like maybe the text talked about make it a little bit bigger and talk more about like what the benefit would be to the parents so right now it looks like a screenshot of the main menu the first moon shot and then the second screenshot talks about like tap the Hat colorful it could be just screenshots that you're pulling from the app and which is fine but what I really loved about your app is the graphics are really well done and so I might move the zebra one to the second one and then make the text a little bit bigger be like word breakdown in pronunciation so that people can read it a little bit more but I would put that as a second one because you know as parents that's one will want to see good graphic because we want our kids to be engaged and it's like what's the benefit of this app versus somebody else and I like the fact that you broke out those words that really spoke to me as a parent like oh that screenshot spoke to me out of the five so in the first screen shot I think is nice like boom you know kind of get sucked me into it and the second screenshot would be hey this is what we do this is why I work great and you might even lead with the first one I think it's strong enough to the zebra one is strong enough to be the first one to the next thing is so are there any paid it you know purchases in this it's just all completely free so you want people to buy the paid one yeah that was the idea because of the whole just paid like inapp purchases with parents you know and kids playing around with it yeah I don't know I don't have any data or any opinion on this I saw I opinion but I don't know how big data back it up and so usually I hesitate to say anything unless I have the data but I would think that it probably comforts better if you just had a net purchase in there you know people used to do this where they would have the light in the pro version and then they would try to crosspromote those two I think it works just fine but I I think having the inapp purchases and the reason why I'm telling you to go that in a purchase route is it allows you to run this campaign that I love the most it's called the pay to free campaign and you can run this with your paid app but you're obviously not gonna make any money off of this but what I would say is you give three animals away for free maybe it's ten for another like pack you have packs different packs and then another package for all of them so you have like three different packages and then the what I would then do is make one of the first packs free maybe like your least performing pack make that memory get pressed for it on app advice and say hey Tyler I'm making this inapp free purchase free for a couple of days love for you to cover it he will cover it and if he doesn't you come back to me Chris because I got a good really good relationship with him but you will cover it and what we seen is that there's thousands of downloads that happen and you actually see an increase in inapp purchases for your other ones just by making that one free I see yeah so it's a really great campaign it's something you can run every quarter on what each every single app mmhmm because Tyler doesn't want to cover too many at the same time all the time but I have a past client who does this every single week like if you see his if you go on a pin vise and you look at that you'll see his apps one of his apps cuz he's got a portfolio and Chris as you build up your portfolio you can start doing this every single week right because what happens is there's actually more downloads for your other apps too so there's this like natural organic crosspollination where people check out your other apps and they see in a boost in downloads yeah I mean that I always knew that was kind of like the endgame like you need a catalog of apps that you can cross promote and you can bundle and sell in bundles too so yeah I'm on a ped virus can free that's the one you're talking about yeah mmhmm that's that's where you want to be because I've done that I've done some case studies where I say here's what happen to my apps when I pitch a device here's what happened when I just made it free and didn't tell anybody not even Chris and like the downloads was thirty thousand when app advice covered it and like two hundred went out the Vice didn't cover it and this is why I totally told you about the reviews because if you read through app advices policies they want you to have a few reviews like you have them average three star rating mmhmm to be Mitch so you can actually do this on your paid version of magic hat and get some reviews you've got one right now but maybe get a few more and then like what I would do is just make it free for a little bit tell a few friends hey guys it's free can you please leave review I really need five to show up and then make it paid again and then pitch app advice and say hey Tyler I'm making this free free from tomorrow it's only free for a couple of days would love for you to cover it and then make it free get long as he covers it you'll get that boost in downloads and then make it paid right away like just make it free for a day make it paid again we did this for another client where his was twelve dollar app Chris but he did thirty thousand downloads Wow and then you mean extra thousand dollars just because we made it free for just one day that he ended up spiking the actual like Travel category I think it was that he made 27 Travel category and I forget it was probably I think it is probably under the paid but then he got a lot more money because he hit that chart and the press came from people ended up buying it so he made $1000 she was pretty happy with that cool now looking at this I want to ask you you know percentagewise if you had to focus your time would it be on ASL or would it be more on like marketing the app from external sources contacting press that sort of thing because it seems like there's a lot to do on that side more more so than that yeah so side right well I look at the app so if I look at first and foremost from an ESO perspective I know that's the it's controllable right if I do a little bit more homework if I put an effort Chris I can get you more downloads that's contributing more now PR I can put in the same down to effort I can do everything put so much passion into it but it's not controllable meaning I can still pitch that reporter and they'll be like oh great job Steve but they say no so what I found is PR when I think about that I don't focus too much on it anymore just because I haven't seen a huge amount of downloads coming from it now if you're thinking about like raising another round of funding or BD business development that is when PR would come into play but I would rather spend my energy on something that I can control and see the results and with PR you're just gonna kind of like amplify Stu but you're just gonna see a bump and then down right whereas ASO you see bump and then hopefully you optimize again you see bump and then you see more right so it becomes sustainable whereas PR just goes up it'll probably go higher than P then ASO but could come right back down yeah it's like a quick win yeah it's like a vanity thing oh hey I was covered on all this stuff now for kids apps I would say it is nice because as parents look to these awards right for some reason I don't know if you feel this way for some reason the fact that they want some silly reward means something to me so I'm like okay it's worth checking out right it's like voted best mom app or whatever it is like okay let me try this app out and so with kids apps I might try to go like featured on Common Sense Media or iPhone mom loves it something like that just to say on the to help my ASO in my conversion just having a screen shot essentially the other thing I mean I focus on is Apple features so this is where I I like Apple I'll just think about this morning but if you think about PR you there's like so many publications that you have to reach out to right and you have to impress and get them to say yes right yeah and so with Apple it's like trying to date or just like finding the person that you love and just going so aggressive on her and trying to get her to say yes right with Apple like you can make that with PR like if you think about them side by side Apple I can try to woo her if I get her to war that's gonna me like millions and millions of downloads a romantic life long life a folded love but if I go PR it's just like was that was a great date but now you're gonna have to find the next PR provocation the next lady the next lady and so I rather focus my energy on pitching Apple and what I would do for you is it I think you had a great graphics is you know like do the go the normal process apps or promotion or App Store comm slash promote and then we did another video before where we try to figure out who the right app store manager is full at Apple to pitch and so if you tell that good story you just have to get one person to say yes and that would lead to tremendous amounts of downloads so I would go after that because it doesn't hurt like there's no they can just say no and then what happens like nothing else you're you're back at where you normally were in is the App Store feature thing of only four new apps coming out like before you've published your app for usually four games there I think they're doing Apple is starting to highlight older games now but they all seem to be the same ones just like a different rotation like I've seen this Apple thank you but for kids apps or non games it's fine it's usually when you've got a good update or they it hits her radar it gets on their radar somehow and we got one of our clients we got featured it was a learn Chinese for kids like completely niche right Chris we got him featured by Apple and the in the US and I think of some other countries to be US and Canada maybe but essentially like I didn't think it would happen but we got it we help them get future and that sounds like an app that I need right now really right good yeah I've got a lot to go on Steve so I'm gonna put this into practice right away and we're going to submit this magic hat up in a couple of weeks so do you have any more words for the audience you have any closing words I would just say look there was a lot covered here start with the ASO I would say to try sign up for that mobile action I would just say start with that try to find these keywords that Kris and I have done where relevant to your app and low competition decent traffic and once you start at that and try to optimize its bits and pieces and you start getting the ball rolling a little bit then you're like home what else you know so get wet your appetite a little bit and just start with the ASO and then start thinking about what other channels you can you can work on cool and what if some people want to learn more about marketing ASO where can they find you or work and they learn more Chris I'm on YouTube you're an inspiration to me man that's like holy cow I've liked your channel before you know I've actually heard people who came in is like I saw you and Chris no I'm so if you go to app master geo you'll find all the information I have a podcast that chris has been on I've got a YouTube channel and the blog tune I interview a bunch of guess that's how I got started in spaces I just started interviewing some of my heroes in space to really learn from them and then started using what they taught and then started teaching back and then modifying obviously a little bit to improving on my learnings yeah actually that podcast is like gold yeah so guys check go check that out Steve runs a pretty frequent podcast anywhere he interviews people who have had a lot of success on the App Store and with their apps so you can learn a lot from that okay so thanks so much Steve and I guess I will let you know how things go when I submit my app yes dude I got a no I'm guaranteeing you I'm guaranteeing you there's gonna be enough tick all right yeah all right thanks take it easy Steve make sure is
