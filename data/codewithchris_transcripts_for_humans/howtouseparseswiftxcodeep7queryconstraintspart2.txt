00:02 - hey coders what's up it's Chris here
00:05 - welcome to part two of query constraints
00:07 - so in the previous lesson we looked at
00:09 - how to perform more specific queries by
00:13 - adding constraints and you learned that
00:14 - there are a whole bunch of different
00:16 - constraints you can add such as equal to
00:18 - not equal to contained and not contained
00:20 - in and so on today we're going to look
00:23 - at some other filters that can help you
00:26 - refine your query some more so let's
00:28 - look at select keys first of all just to
00:31 - refresh your memory in our parse class
00:35 - for contact we have a couple of fields
00:38 - we have email first name and last name
00:40 - so what if I were only interested in the
00:42 - email for this query and I didn't care
00:44 - about the first name or last name well
00:46 - we can actually save some bandwidth and
00:48 - data for the user if we don't retrieve
00:51 - this data we can just say retrieve the
00:54 - email data that's all we want and select
00:57 - Kies allows you to do that so we would
00:59 - type query dot select keys and here we
01:02 - pass in an array of the keys that we
01:05 - want to return so we would do that and
01:07 - then this would be in addition to any
01:10 - other constraints that we have so let's
01:12 - say we were using this query right here
01:14 - let me just grab that put that there
01:16 - here we are grabbing all of the contacts
01:19 - that have age greater than 30 and I only
01:23 - want their emails so this is going to do
01:25 - that and then after that remember you
01:27 - have to go find objects in background or
01:31 - find objects in background with block to
01:33 - actually execute the query okay so
01:35 - that's select keys another thing that
01:37 - you can do is called limit so let me
01:41 - actually just comment this out I don't
01:43 - want to delete it so if you download
01:44 - this project you have it for reference
01:46 - so let me just copy this line let's say
01:49 - we're performing another query and we
01:51 - want to limit the results to a certain
01:53 - number we can do limit and we can set it
01:56 - to some number so it says here the
01:58 - default is 100 with a maximum a thousand
02:01 - results being returned at a time so say
02:04 - I want to limit it ten results that's
02:06 - how you would do it now you saw the
02:07 - maximum results for a query is a
02:10 - thousand being returned so what if you
02:12 - expect that your
02:13 - where you might return more than a
02:15 - thousand well you're going to have to
02:17 - use skip so let me show you how this
02:19 - works just comment this out so this
02:25 - query limit you know if I expected this
02:29 - query to return more than a thousand and
02:30 - I set my limit to a thousand it's gonna
02:33 - return the first 1000 results if I want
02:36 - to get anything beyond that I'm going to
02:38 - have to do something like this query dot
02:41 - skip and this is going to skip the first
02:45 - X number of results so I would say you
02:48 - know skip the first 1000 because I got
02:50 - it before and give me the next whatever
02:53 - remainder there is so that's how skip
02:55 - works and then we have some sorting done
03:01 - this is actually not sort by its order
03:04 - by and what we would do is just query
03:07 - dot order by and you can order by
03:10 - ascending or descending on a certain key
03:14 - we can say you know give me first name
03:17 - like that in alphabetical order okay and
03:22 - this get first object method will
03:24 - basically just return the first result
03:27 - in your data set let's say if you're
03:29 - just interested in a single result you
03:31 - would go like instead of find objects in
03:34 - background you would say get first
03:38 - object get first object in background
03:40 - probably with block and so it this block
03:45 - of code is going to return a single PF
03:47 - object or it could be nil you can see
03:49 - here that there's a question mark so it
03:51 - could return nil so this would be your
03:53 - object and this would be your error and
03:57 - in here code to run when first object is
04:03 - returned so this is how the get first
04:06 - object method works let me comment that
04:09 - out
04:13 - and finally count objects what if you're
04:17 - only interested in the number of results
04:19 - in this case you know we're looking for
04:21 - the people who have age greater than 30
04:25 - but we don't care about the actual
04:27 - people we only care about the number of
04:29 - people where the age is greater than 30
04:31 - so we would say carry dot count objects
04:36 - in background or count objects in
04:38 - background with block and you would do
04:39 - this instead of find objects because
04:42 - this will just return you the count so
04:44 - let me expand that block see you get an
04:47 - int there I'm just going to call that
04:48 - number and this is an error parameter
04:51 - and in here we're going to say code to
04:54 - run when the count is returned and so
04:58 - that's how you would use that and next I
05:01 - want to show you guys how to do compound
05:03 - queries so so far we've looked at all of
05:07 - these query constraints we're adding
05:09 - more constraints is going to be an end
05:11 - Clause so like I said for this query
05:14 - right here for example we are creating
05:16 - query on the contact class and we're
05:18 - saying return all of the contacts where
05:21 - the first name has the prefix tío and
05:24 - the first name has the suffix why what
05:28 - if we wanted to do an or what if we
05:30 - wanted to say return all the contacts
05:32 - where it either has a prefix of tio or
05:35 - has a suffix of Y so in that case this
05:38 - one fit the bill right because if we add
05:40 - these two constraints it becomes an end
05:42 - so the technique to do an or query or
05:45 - otherwise known as a compound query is
05:47 - what they call it you have to create two
05:50 - queries one looking for results which
05:53 - has the prefix of tio and another query
05:55 - looking for results which have the
05:57 - suffix Y and then we can use those two
05:59 - queries to create a compound query so
06:01 - let me show you how that works you just
06:03 - create another section down here
06:05 - so compound queries I'm just gonna write
06:10 - or here so you remember that okay so let
06:14 - query equals let's actually make it more
06:18 - descriptive prefix query equals that
06:22 - class name is call
06:25 - and so we're gonna add our claws now
06:27 - prefix query where key has prefix so key
06:33 - I want first name and the prefix is what
06:37 - we had before like that and I'm gonna
06:40 - create another query I'm gonna call this
06:42 - the suffix query and this is also
06:45 - performed on the contact class and this
06:49 - one let's add the clause has suffix
06:54 - first name ends with Y okay so now I
06:59 - have two separate queries now I'm gonna
07:01 - create a compound crater house both of
07:04 - them I'm gonna call this the or query
07:07 - actually let's use capital Q here just
07:11 - for some consistency and what we would
07:14 - do here is write PF query it's a class
07:17 - method so it's C or yeah there it is or
07:22 - query with sub queries so when here you
07:25 - pass in an array of PF query so that's
07:28 - what we're gonna do here and we're gonna
07:31 - combine the prefix query with the suffix
07:33 - query and here this is our compound
07:37 - query so all we need to do is run it by
07:41 - saying find objects and background like
07:43 - that just like we've done if we were
07:46 - doing a single query so it returns array
07:49 - of PF objects objects
07:55 - error code to run when the compound
08:01 - query returns so in this case it's gonna
08:05 - search through the contacts tour for all
08:09 - queries which has first name equal to or
08:12 - starts with TL or first name ends with Y
08:16 - and actually Xcode is complaining here
08:18 - because I change this to capital Q I
08:20 - need to do the same here and here so
08:23 - that's queries in a nutshell I hope that
08:25 - it gives you some ideas about how to
08:28 - query your own parse back end and
08:30 - there's still a ton of things to talk
08:32 - about regarding the parse platform and
08:34 - how to access your data so stay tuned
08:36 - and I'll see you guys tomorrow thanks
08:38 - for watching please subscribe and like
08:40 - the video and please share the video if
08:41 - you think that it would help someone
08:43 - else thanks so much I'll see you guys
08:44 - tomorrow bye

saw the maximum results for a query is a thousand being returned so what if you expect that your where you might return more than a thousand well you're going to have to use skip so let me show you how this works just comment this out so this query limit you know if I expected this query to return more than a thousand and I set my limit to a thousand it's gonna return the first 1000 results if I want to get anything beyond that I'm going to have to do something like this query dot skip and this is going to skip the first X number of results so I would say you know skip the first 1000 because

finally count objects what if you're only interested in the number of results in this case you know we're looking for the people who have age greater than 30 but we don't care about the actual people we only care about the number of people where the age is greater than 30 so we would say carry dot count objects in background or count objects in background with block and you would do this instead of find objects because this will just return you the count so let me expand that block see you get an int there I'm just going to call that number and this is an error parameter and in here we're
