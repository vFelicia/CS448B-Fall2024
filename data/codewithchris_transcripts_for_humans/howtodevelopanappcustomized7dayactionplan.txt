00:00 - hey coke crew what's up by far one of
00:03 - the most common questions I get in my
00:04 - inbox is I have app idea of X how do I
00:07 - go about building it or does she of
00:10 - course teach me how to build this app or
00:12 - I have this million-dollar app idea
00:15 - I want to partner with you to build it
00:17 - together and I think where this all
00:19 - comes from is that these people have a
00:22 - vision of what they want to build and
00:24 - accomplish but they have no idea where
00:27 - to start or what road to take to get to
00:30 - that destination so that's why today I
00:32 - want to introduce you to a free email
00:35 - course that I created called a 7-day tap
00:37 - action plan and the goal of this email
00:40 - course is basically it to take someone
00:42 - from not knowing anything and all I have
00:45 - is that app idea that vision to having a
00:48 - very concrete list of learning topics
00:52 - that they need to take that they need to
00:54 - learn in order to build that sort of app
00:58 - that they want to create so let's go
00:59 - inside and I want to quickly run you
01:01 - through just how this is achieved in
01:03 - seven days all right so we're inside now
01:07 - and I want to show you what the seven
01:09 - day app action plan is all you have to
01:11 - do is visit the URL in the description
01:13 - or just go to code with Chris comm slash
01:17 - action plan and as I said it's a seven
01:20 - day email course but I wouldn't run you
01:22 - through the seven days and exactly how
01:25 - we can create a personalized learning
01:27 - plan for anybody who wants to create
01:30 - their own app now in day one it's
01:33 - basically an introductory lesson if you
01:35 - know all about Xcode Swift and iOS app
01:39 - development then this is pretty much a
01:41 - wash for you but a lot of people you
01:43 - know they have an app idea they don't
01:44 - even know this stuff so that's what day
01:45 - one is about day two is about the eight
01:48 - steps building any app and that's really
01:50 - the app development process so how you
01:51 - go from and I fleshing out your business
01:54 - requirements to wireframing and then
01:57 - prototyping and design and stuff like
01:59 - that so it kind of walks you through all
02:01 - of those steps and it's basically the
02:03 - steps that we did when we did software
02:05 - consulting for people at my old job as
02:08 - well and I think for a lot of people who
02:10 - haven't built apps professionally they
02:11 - may not know
02:12 - these this app development process now
02:16 - day three is where it's supposed to get
02:17 - really interesting because you can start
02:19 - to build your personalized roadmap and
02:21 - this is what I alluded to before it's
02:24 - actually on a separate domain I'll just
02:26 - tell you right now it's app roadmap dot
02:29 - IO so if you visit this URL you're going
02:33 - to have a sort of like customized wizard
02:35 - that's going to ask you a bunch of
02:37 - questions or rather you go through it
02:39 - and you select which features are going
02:42 - to be in your app so let's run through a
02:45 - couple of things here for example in the
02:49 - design and prototyping session you can
02:51 - say I want to learn app design or I want
02:52 - to hire a designer user accounts is your
02:56 - app going to have let people log in
02:59 - right and you basically select all of
03:02 - the things that you anticipate your app
03:05 - needing and I try to phrase this in as
03:07 - plain English as possible not using any
03:10 - technical jargon and you know navigation
03:14 - is gonna have multiple screens it's
03:16 - gonna have a tab bar it's gonna have a
03:17 - side menu so you just go through it
03:19 - there's a whole bunch of questions but
03:21 - more accurately you can answer these
03:25 - questions the better your results are
03:27 - going to be and also I think this is
03:31 - going to force you to think about your
03:33 - app idea because a lot of people just
03:35 - have this general vision of what they
03:38 - want but they haven't really thought of
03:40 - the finer details and so what I'm asking
03:43 - you such specific questions it's gonna
03:45 - force you to be more specific
03:48 - and have a more concrete definition of
03:52 - what you want to achieve and that's kind
03:54 - of the first step to achieving something
03:55 - right you need to know exactly where
03:58 - you're going and what you want to do and
04:00 - then there's some like mapping features
04:02 - and you basically select everything you
04:06 - need so I'm just gonna randomly go
04:08 - select stuff at the bottom of the page
04:10 - there's a green button to say click here
04:12 - to get your roadmap and it's basically
04:14 - going to give you recommendations for
04:17 - all of the features that you selected
04:19 - it's gonna give you some tips some notes
04:22 - some recommendations on where and how to
04:24 - achieve
04:25 - and learn those things just a little bit
04:29 - of a caveat here first is that I don't
04:32 - want to overwhelm you because I think
04:34 - for a lot of people they're gonna start
04:36 - to get overwhelmed right away with the
04:38 - list of things that they have to learn
04:39 - and you know that's just the reality
04:42 - right if you don't want to accomplish a
04:45 - giant app that's really complex there's
04:47 - a lot to do and there's a lot to learn
04:48 - so I just have a little blurb here
04:50 - telling people that you know you got to
04:52 - take it easy and enjoy the journey and
04:54 - if you go you can download a copy a pdf
04:58 - version of your personalized roadmap if
05:00 - you want and then I have a whole bunch
05:04 - of links for basically everything that
05:06 - you wanted to learn that you said that
05:09 - your app would need places to learn all
05:12 - of those different things so you can go
05:15 - through that and then by the end of that
05:17 - you're gonna have a customized roadmap
05:20 - to achieve your goal then the problem is
05:24 - now you have a map but where do you
05:27 - start and how do you start so days four
05:30 - five six seven is to get you started
05:34 - along that path day four basically tells
05:37 - people about my beginner series that's a
05:40 - great place to start a lot of people
05:42 - have gone through that and kind of
05:43 - gotten their fundamentals at least
05:46 - gotten started got gotten the ball
05:48 - rolling right and day five is about how
05:52 - you can get more experience like after
05:53 - you finish the basic stuff where do you
05:55 - go from there
05:56 - and the gist of it is you just got to
05:58 - build more app so you just gotta go
06:00 - through more tutorials go through more
06:01 - demos get more practice hours in and
06:04 - every time you build one of those like
06:06 - little demos even if the app is kind of
06:09 - dumb and it's really small you're
06:11 - learning something each time you make a
06:13 - mistake and you get through it you're
06:15 - learning something day six is all about
06:17 - databases people always have questions
06:20 - about databases and how do I get one for
06:22 - my app how do I use one well they six
06:25 - will tell you some of the options that
06:27 - are available some of the differences
06:29 - and pros and cons and stuff like that
06:31 - day seven is about creating graphic
06:33 - assets for your app if that's what
06:36 - you're interested in doing
06:39 - right so again this is a free email
06:40 - course and it's not for everybody right
06:42 - if you're well-versed in app development
06:45 - and you're kind of learning the
06:46 - intermediate advanced stuff then to be
06:50 - honest this is probably not going to
06:51 - help you but if you know anybody who's
06:53 - just starting out or they have an app
06:55 - idea but they never really knew how to
06:58 - get started and they don't have the
06:59 - motivation to get started well bring
07:02 - them to this website code with Chris
07:04 - comm slash action plan all right all you
07:07 - have to do is click the green button and
07:09 - then enter in your name and email and
07:11 - it's going to give you one of those
07:13 - emails every day for seven days and
07:14 - that's it
07:15 - so hope this was helpful I hope you can
07:18 - share this with someone who you know
07:19 - wants to build an app and I'll see you
07:22 - guys next time
