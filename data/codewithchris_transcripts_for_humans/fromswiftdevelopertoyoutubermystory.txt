00:00 - hey code crew this was a talk that I did
00:02 - at the Swift teal conference last week
00:05 - and just to give you a little bit of
00:07 - context to this talk at the audience the
00:10 - attendees to this conference were Swift
00:12 - developers and Swift enthusiasts mostly
00:15 - Swift developers and so my talk is about
00:17 - inspiring them to share their knowledge
00:20 - and I did this through my own journey
00:22 - and how I went from a swift and
00:25 - objective-c developer to doing what I do
00:27 - now so it was really fun and exciting
00:30 - and I was pretty nervous because I
00:32 - hadn't done any public speaking in a
00:34 - very long time in any case I hope you
00:36 - enjoy it
00:40 - [Music]
00:52 - a little testing testing hello yeah okay
01:03 - man when I wrote that I didn't think she
01:05 - was gonna read it out and use it as my
01:06 - intro so it's a little bit embarrassing
01:10 - but hey everyone my name is Chris Chang
01:13 - and for the last six years I've been
01:15 - teaching non coders how to code in Swift
01:17 - and I do this through my YouTube channel
01:19 - and my website code with Chris calm but
01:22 - the thing is I never dreamed of becoming
01:24 - a youtuber I was actually an objective-c
01:26 - developer before and through a series of
01:28 - weird twists and turns and unexpected
01:30 - decisions I found a passion for teaching
01:33 - and well here I am today and I didn't
01:35 - think I'd be doing this six years later
01:38 - but the point of this talk today is not
01:41 - to inspire you guys to also become
01:43 - youtubers instead I want to inspire you
01:45 - guys with my story to keep your door
01:48 - open for the unexpected and wonderful
01:51 - things that can happen by doing the four
01:54 - things that I'm going to show you how to
01:55 - do today now before this turns into some
01:59 - weird motivational speech I assure you
02:01 - it's not it's not gonna be fluffy like
02:03 - that I have some concrete examples that
02:06 - I'm gonna share with you all these
02:08 - people here have had life-changing
02:10 - things happen to themselves and when I
02:13 - look back at my own journey and their
02:14 - journeys I realized that there were four
02:17 - things that I identified that we all did
02:19 - in common and that's really what I want
02:22 - to share with you today and I'm gonna do
02:24 - that in the context of my own journey so
02:26 - number one is I got involved with the
02:30 - developer community now why is this
02:32 - significant for me it was very
02:34 - significant because that was how I got
02:36 - exposed to Iowa's development and had it
02:39 - not been for this I don't think I would
02:40 - have so let me explain when I graduated
02:43 - at my first job I worked with Microsoft
02:45 - Silverlight and I see we have some
02:48 - civilized developers here and it was a
02:52 - lot of fun at that point it was a brand
02:54 - new technology to enable rich user
02:56 - experiences on the web as new not many
02:59 - people working with it was visual is fun
03:01 - for me but it was a pretty tight-knit
03:04 - community because there it wasn't that
03:06 - widespread and as a result I got
03:08 - involved with the Toronto Silverlight
03:10 - user group and this user group was
03:12 - started by two founders from Mississauga
03:14 - who had a consulting company so I helped
03:17 - them organize events monthly and I would
03:19 - sometimes speak at these events or I
03:21 - would attend them but the bottom line is
03:23 - that I got to know these organizers
03:25 - really well and at the time I didn't
03:27 - know it but eventually they would become
03:29 - my bosses because you see I left my
03:31 - first job tried to start my own business
03:33 - failed tried to start another one
03:35 - failed and then eventually started
03:37 - freelancing for these two guys and then
03:39 - I joined their consulting company as
03:41 - maybe the twelfth employee or something
03:43 - like that but it was at this second
03:45 - company that I got involved with Windows
03:47 - Phone development so you see a trend
03:49 - here everything I work on just kind of
03:51 - like dies so that's not the case
03:52 - received but um Windows Phone
03:55 - development so being good at that led me
03:58 - to become that company's first
04:00 - objective-c developer and being the
04:02 - first objective-c developer and only one
04:04 - at that company was kind of tough for me
04:06 - because I struggled to learn memory
04:07 - management I didn't have a more senior
04:09 - mentor to guide me and I didn't have
04:12 - objective-c team members to bat ideas
04:14 - back and forth with so every obstacle
04:17 - that I overcame every hurdle that I
04:19 - solved it was really hard one but at the
04:21 - same time it was really satisfying I'm
04:23 - sure as you guys being developers you
04:25 - know how it feels like to solve a really
04:26 - tough problem and I think this slide
04:28 - really epitomizes that feeling right yes
04:31 - finally got it so when our CTO said you
04:34 - should share our knowledge I was totally
04:37 - on board with that you know spending
04:39 - time so much time trying to figure these
04:40 - things out I thought I could really help
04:44 - other people in case other people were
04:46 - facing the same problems and save them a
04:47 - ton of time so that brings me to my
04:49 - second point which is sharing your
04:51 - knowledge to me for me that took the
04:54 - form of a wordpress blog so I just
04:57 - whipped something up I started
04:58 - documenting my day-to-day learnings and
05:00 - the things I was figuring out with no
05:03 - expectations of who would read it and
05:04 - trying to build an audience or anything
05:06 - like that but I thought if I could just
05:09 - help someone you know in the odd case
05:13 - that they were trying to figure out the
05:14 - same problem that I was I would save
05:18 - them a ton of time
05:20 - and I continued to do this I continue to
05:22 - document my learnings and over time I
05:25 - start to realize I had a pretty
05:26 - in-demand skill set because up till that
05:28 - point I would tell my friends and family
05:31 - that I did da net I did C sharp I did
05:35 - Windows Phone what's that right and then
05:37 - now when I was doing this I told people
05:39 - I I built I phone apps and instantly
05:41 - they got it but then the next question
05:44 - was I have an app idea all right so it
05:49 - seemed like back then at least in 2013
05:51 - everyone had their own app idea and
05:52 - everyone thought I'd be the next big
05:54 - thing it'd be the next million dollar
05:56 - billion dollar app idea and so I thought
05:58 - hey it'd be kind of cool to try to teach
06:01 - people how to build their own apps
06:03 - because everyone seems to want to but I
06:06 - was really doubtful because you know how
06:09 - can you try to teach a non developer
06:10 - objective-c I mean I was having enough
06:12 - trouble with it so it was a fun
06:15 - challenge for me to see if I could teach
06:18 - someone who's never coded a single line
06:20 - of code before to build their own app
06:23 - using objective-c and so I decided to
06:27 - use the video to do this because I
06:28 - thought for someone who had never coded
06:30 - before being able to see me go through
06:32 - the motions would be very beneficial and
06:34 - choosing video naturally led me to
06:36 - YouTube and so I bought a $30 mic and I
06:39 - started to produce videos now this
06:43 - snapshot kind of documents my six-year
06:46 - journey on YouTube so far but we're
06:48 - gonna get back to this slide the most
06:50 - important thing is that I got started
06:51 - that brings me to my third point I got
06:54 - started now this might seem kind of like
06:56 - a cop-out point but actually getting
06:58 - started is really really tough because
07:00 - there's so many obstacles to stop us
07:03 - from getting started from doing anything
07:05 - and going back to Tim's talked about the
07:08 - MiG bella is actually natural for your
07:10 - brain to stop you from doing unknown
07:12 - risky uncertain things it's like a
07:13 - safety mechanism and so for me I had a
07:16 - lot of obstacles that I had to overcome
07:18 - just to start putting videos on YouTube
07:20 - and so I want to talk about a couple of
07:22 - them some of my biggest ones so number
07:25 - one is I knew my friends and family
07:27 - we're gonna see these videos and so I
07:29 - wanted them to be perfect my first video
07:31 - on YouTube was actually eight and a half
07:33 - minute
07:33 - long but I remember I kept tree
07:35 - recording it it took me days just to get
07:37 - it right and I thought it was perfect at
07:39 - that time but now when I look back on
07:40 - that first video I still cringe so
07:42 - you're just gonna have to believe that
07:44 - you're gonna get better at it over time
07:45 - it's like a skill number two is imposter
07:48 - syndrome and Tim touched on this it's
07:51 - just that feeling when you get up there
07:53 - and you're talking just like I am now
07:54 - what qualifies me to be up here to teach
07:57 - him to talk and whenever this still
08:00 - creeps up on me today and when it does I
08:02 - try to remember that it's like a path
08:03 - it's a journey so there are people ahead
08:05 - of you way ahead of you experts and
08:07 - there are people behind you just getting
08:09 - started and those are the people that
08:12 - you're helping that you're enriching
08:14 - their lives and you're trying to bring
08:15 - them up to where you are and so that's
08:18 - what I try to keep in mind and actually
08:20 - keep a page on my website with all of
08:22 - the heartfelt thanks and comments that I
08:24 - get when I feel like an impostor I read
08:26 - this and it reassures me that I'm doing
08:28 - the right thing and I'm changing
08:30 - people's lives and I'm enriching their
08:32 - lives and I'm I should keep doing what
08:33 - I'm doing another thing that might help
08:36 - you to get started is the thought that
08:39 - you are making the world a more
08:41 - efficient place because think about some
08:43 - of the problems that you're solving at
08:44 - work sometimes they can take days and by
08:47 - you sharing that knowledge to the
08:49 - community you could potentially be
08:51 - saving other developers hours of time
08:53 - and productivity that they could
08:55 - dedicate to something else and thereby
08:57 - you're making the world a better and
08:59 - more efficient place but getting started
09:02 - is one thing the next step is you have
09:04 - to have the right expectations because
09:06 - going back to this graph you can see
09:09 - that it was really long during six years
09:11 - and that is the one year mark and that's
09:13 - when Swift came out and along this way I
09:16 - also had two kids probably that plateau
09:18 - there but I didn't post regularly hey
09:22 - these big red bars represent months at a
09:25 - time where I didn't post at all and then
09:27 - the yellow arrows are time for when I
09:28 - posted like a madman it probably would
09:31 - have been better if I was consistent
09:32 - with it but I was doing it for the right
09:36 - reasons I knew I was helping people I
09:38 - was getting good feedback from people
09:40 - thanking me and stuff like that so
09:42 - that's what kept me going and had I
09:44 - stopped early on or had I had that
09:46 - thought of
09:47 - I'm gonna make X amount of dollars in
09:49 - the first year or have X amount of
09:50 - subscribers in six months or something
09:52 - like that I probably would have put in
09:53 - the first month and then I never would
09:56 - have seen that tail end I speak from
09:58 - experience because at eight months I did
10:01 - quit my job to try to make this my
10:03 - full-time gig and there was a
10:05 - combination of different reasons for me
10:08 - quitting my full-time job but the
10:11 - biggest reason was I discovered the
10:14 - satisfaction and teaching that I never
10:17 - knew existed I couldn't understand why
10:19 - anybody would want to be a teacher but
10:21 - once I started hearing feedback from
10:25 - people and see how people reacted when
10:28 - they ran their first a little bit of
10:29 - code it reminded me when I got exposed
10:32 - to programming at first that wonderment
10:34 - that aw that joy right and to think that
10:38 - I could help other people experience
10:40 - that that really blew my mind and I was
10:43 - like this is way more satisfying than
10:45 - what I was doing at work and so I was
10:48 - like if I could do this full-time that
10:50 - would be my dream job just giving people
10:52 - this feeling changing their lives and
10:54 - storing them on this coding journey like
10:55 - I had when I discovered the only problem
10:59 - was that you too really wasn't paying me
11:00 - anything and so I quit my job and I
11:04 - ended up doing a bunch of freelancing
11:06 - that's a big blue part there I had built
11:08 - up a little bit of an audience so I had
11:10 - some course I made a course and I was
11:12 - selling that that's the green part and
11:14 - YouTube represents that little red
11:16 - sliver but like I said I kept doing what
11:20 - I was doing I kept producing videos and
11:23 - six years later the green parts are my
11:27 - core sales and the red part is my
11:28 - YouTube revenue and I would never have
11:30 - guessed that this would become my life
11:32 - but I love what I'm doing but you see my
11:35 - story isn't unique because this Shawn
11:37 - Allen he started his he started sharing
11:40 - his tech job interview experiences on
11:42 - YouTube and he was getting great
11:43 - feedback and he decided to continue to
11:45 - produce videos it was also a creative
11:47 - outlet for him he got involved with the
11:50 - Swift community on Twitter and now two
11:51 - and a half years later he's made the
11:53 - leap to become a full-time content
11:54 - creator with some freelancing on the
11:56 - side and then there's Mark Morgan's he
12:00 - always loved
12:01 - his knowledge with his coworkers I
12:02 - worked but one day no one was in the
12:05 - office so he decided to record a video
12:07 - put it on YouTube for his co-workers to
12:08 - watch little did he know that it was
12:11 - public and he started getting good
12:13 - feedback on it which motivated him to
12:15 - continue producing videos and now four
12:18 - years later he's built up this little
12:19 - audience that it might possible for him
12:22 - and his wife see traveled the world with
12:24 - no end date and this was a totally
12:27 - unexpected result from him just teaching
12:30 - online and he also had to overcome a
12:32 - huge sense of impostor syndrome and then
12:36 - there's Johnson Nell I don't think this
12:37 - guy needs any introduction but this year
12:40 - he's made the leap to become a full-time
12:41 - content creator he stopped doing his
12:43 - freelancing and there's this tweet that
12:46 - I really love because it really captures
12:47 - the essence of my fourth point now read
12:49 - it to you guys in case anyone can read
12:51 - it every blog podcast and github project
12:54 - started out with an audience of zero if
12:56 - you want to create content or open
12:57 - source do it because you love it and
12:59 - keep working hard even when no one is
13:00 - paying attention just look at my number
13:02 - of readers it's all about time and
13:04 - consistency so that goes back to just
13:07 - doing it for the right reasons
13:08 - so just to recap number one get involved
13:11 - with the community you guys being here
13:12 - you know that's on the right track and
13:15 - don't forget Twitter reddit user groups
13:17 - like I did start sharing your knowledge
13:19 - this doesn't have to be really hard just
13:21 - document your day to day learnings on
13:23 - Twitter or on Instagram give me it as
13:26 - easy as that
13:27 - and then get started the best advice I
13:30 - can give you is to take imperfect action
13:32 - I love that term because that perfectly
13:35 - captures you know it's not going to be
13:37 - perfect at the start and having the
13:42 - right expectations so for me it took six
13:44 - years but I think that had I been more
13:48 - consistent and maybe more focused on it
13:50 - it would have been shorter for a lot of
13:52 - people that I highlighted in this talk
13:53 - it was about two and a half to three
13:55 - years remember John's tweet and then I
13:58 - have a quote from Steve Jobs that really
14:00 - captures the essence of my talk here you
14:03 - can't connect the dots looking forward
14:04 - you can only connect them looking
14:05 - backwards so you have to trust the dots
14:07 - will somehow connect in your future you
14:09 - don't you have to trust in something
14:11 - your gut destiny life karma whatever
14:13 - this approach has never
14:15 - me down and has made all the difference
14:16 - in my life so by you guys getting out
14:20 - into the community putting yourself out
14:21 - there sharing your knowledge you're in
14:24 - essence putting more dots on the map and
14:26 - you just have to have some faith that
14:28 - those thoughts will connect in some
14:29 - weird unexpected life-changing way in
14:32 - the future so I've got some of my
14:35 - contact info there if you want to reach
14:37 - out and chat if you guys were thinking
14:39 - about starting your own journey feel
14:41 - free to reach out and contact the info
14:43 - of some of the other people I mentioned
14:45 - in this talk as well thank you so much
14:47 - you guys have been a great audience
14:52 - thank you so much Chris
14:54 - [Applause]

Cleaned transcript:

hey code crew this was a talk that I did at the Swift teal conference last week and just to give you a little bit of context to this talk at the audience the attendees to this conference were Swift developers and Swift enthusiasts mostly Swift developers and so my talk is about inspiring them to share their knowledge and I did this through my own journey and how I went from a swift and objectivec developer to doing what I do now so it was really fun and exciting and I was pretty nervous because I hadn't done any public speaking in a very long time in any case I hope you enjoy it a little testing testing hello yeah okay man when I wrote that I didn't think she was gonna read it out and use it as my intro so it's a little bit embarrassing but hey everyone my name is Chris Chang and for the last six years I've been teaching non coders how to code in Swift and I do this through my YouTube channel and my website code with Chris calm but the thing is I never dreamed of becoming a youtuber I was actually an objectivec developer before and through a series of weird twists and turns and unexpected decisions I found a passion for teaching and well here I am today and I didn't think I'd be doing this six years later but the point of this talk today is not to inspire you guys to also become youtubers instead I want to inspire you guys with my story to keep your door open for the unexpected and wonderful things that can happen by doing the four things that I'm going to show you how to do today now before this turns into some weird motivational speech I assure you it's not it's not gonna be fluffy like that I have some concrete examples that I'm gonna share with you all these people here have had lifechanging things happen to themselves and when I look back at my own journey and their journeys I realized that there were four things that I identified that we all did in common and that's really what I want to share with you today and I'm gonna do that in the context of my own journey so number one is I got involved with the developer community now why is this significant for me it was very significant because that was how I got exposed to Iowa's development and had it not been for this I don't think I would have so let me explain when I graduated at my first job I worked with Microsoft Silverlight and I see we have some civilized developers here and it was a lot of fun at that point it was a brand new technology to enable rich user experiences on the web as new not many people working with it was visual is fun for me but it was a pretty tightknit community because there it wasn't that widespread and as a result I got involved with the Toronto Silverlight user group and this user group was started by two founders from Mississauga who had a

and at the time I didn't know it but eventually they would become my bosses because you see I left my first job tried to start my own business failed tried to start another one failed and then eventually started freelancing for these two guys and then I joined their consulting company as maybe the twelfth employee or something like that but it was at this second company that I got involved with Windows Phone development so you see a trend here everything I work on just kind of like dies so that's not the case received but um Windows Phone development so being good at that led me to become that company's first objectivec developer and being the first objectivec developer and only one at that company was kind of tough for me because I struggled to learn memory management I didn't have a more senior mentor to guide me and I didn't have objectivec team members to bat ideas back and forth with so every obstacle that I overcame every hurdle that I solved it was really hard one but at the same time it was really satisfying I'm sure as you guys being developers you know how it feels like to solve a really tough problem and I think this slide really epitomizes that feeling right yes finally got it so when our CTO said you should share our knowledge I was totally on board with that you know spending time so much time trying to figure these things out I thought I could really help other people in case other people were facing the same problems and save them a ton of time so that brings me to my second point which is sharing your knowledge to me for me that took the form of a wordpress blog so I just whipped something up I started documenting my daytoday learnings and the things I was figuring out with no expectations of who would read it and trying to build an audience or anything like that but I thought if I could just help someone you know in the odd case that they were trying to figure out the same problem that I was I would save them a ton of time and I

video naturally led me to YouTube and so I bought a $30 mic and I started to produce videos now this snapshot kind of documents my sixyear journey on YouTube so far but we're gonna get back to this slide the most important thing is that I got started that brings me to my third point I got started now this might seem kind of like a copout point but actually getting started is really really tough because there's so many obstacles to stop us from getting started from doing anything and going back to Tim's talked about the MiG bella is actually natural for your brain to stop you from doing unknown risky uncertain things it's like a safety mechanism and so for me I had a lot of obstacles that I had to overcome just to start putting videos on YouTube and so I want to talk about a couple of them some of my biggest ones so number one is I knew my friends and family we're gonna see these videos and so I wanted them to be perfect my first video on YouTube was actually eight and a half minute long but I remember I kept tree recording it it took me days just to get it right and I thought it was perfect at that time but now when I look back on that first video I still cringe so you're just gonna have to believe that you're gonna get better at it over time it's like a skill number two is imposter syndrome and Tim touched on this it's just that feeling when you get up there and you're talking just like I am now what qualifies me to be up here to teach him to talk and whenever this still creeps up on me today and when it does I try to remember that it's like a path it's a journey so there are people ahead of you way ahead of you experts and there are people behind you just getting started and those are the people that you're helping that you're enriching their lives and you're trying to bring them up to where you are and so that's what I try to keep in mind and actually keep a page on my website with all of the heartfelt thanks and comments that I get when I feel like an impostor I read this and it reassures me that I'm doing the right thing and I'm changing people's lives and I'm enriching their lives and I'm I should keep doing what I'm doing another thing that might help you to get started is the thought that you are making the world a more efficient place because think about some of the problems that you're solving at work sometimes they can take days and by you sharing that knowledge to the community you could potentially be saving other developers hours of time and productivity that they could dedicate to something else and thereby you're making the world a better and more efficient place but getting started is one thing the next step is you have to have the right expectations because going back to this graph you can see that it was really long during six years and that is the one year mark and that's when Swift came out and along this way I also had two kids probably that plateau there but I didn't post regularly hey these big red bars represent months at a time where I didn't post at all and then the yellow arrows are time for when I posted like a madman it probably would have been better if I was consistent with it but I was doing it for the right reasons I knew I was helping people I was getting good feedback from people thanking me and stuff like that so that's what kept me going and had I stopped early on or had I had that thought of I'm gonna make X amount of dollars in the first year or have X amount of subscribers in six months or something like that I probably would have put in the first month and then I never would have seen that tail end I speak from experience because at eight months I did quit my job to try to make this my fulltime gig and there was a combination of different reasons for me quitting my fulltime job but the biggest reason was I discovered the satisfaction and teaching that I never knew existed I couldn't understand why anybody would want to be a teacher but once I started hearing feedback from people and see how people reacted when they ran their first a little bit of code it reminded me when I got exposed to programming at first that wonderment that aw that joy right and to think that I could help other people experience that that really blew my mind and I was like this is way more satisfying than what I was doing at work and so I was like if I could do this fulltime that would be my dream job just giving people this feeling changing their lives and storing them on this coding journey like I had when I discovered the only problem was that you too really wasn't paying me anything and so I quit my job and I ended up doing a bunch of freelancing that's a big blue part there I had built up a little bit of an audience so I had some course I made a course and I was selling that that's the green part and YouTube represents that little red sliver but like I said I kept doing what I was doing I kept producing videos and six years later the green parts are my core sales and the red part is my YouTube revenue and I would never have guessed that this would become my life but I love what I'm doing but you see my story isn't unique because this Shawn Allen he started his he started sharing his tech job interview experiences on YouTube and he was getting great feedback and he decided to continue to produce videos it was also a creative outlet for him he got involved with the Swift community on Twitter and now two and a half years later he's made the leap to become a fulltime content creator with some freelancing on the side and then there's Mark Morgan's he always loved his knowledge with his coworkers I worked but one day no one was in the office so he decided to record a video put it on YouTube for his coworkers to watch little did he know that it was public and he started getting good feedback on it which motivated him to continue producing videos and now four years later he's built up this little audience that it might possible for him and his wife see traveled the world with no end date and this was a totally unexpected result from him just teaching online and he also had to overcome a huge sense of impostor syndrome and then there's Johnson Nell I don't think this guy needs any introduction but this year he's made the leap to become a fulltime content creator he stopped doing his freelancing and there's this tweet that I really love because it really captures the essence of my fourth point now read it to you guys in case anyone can read it every blog podcast and github project started out with an audience of zero if you want to create content or open source do it because you love it and keep working hard even when no one is paying attention just look at my number of readers it's all about time and consistency so that goes back to just doing it for the right reasons so just to recap number one get involved with the community you guys being here you know that's on the right track and don't forget Twitter reddit user groups like I did start sharing your knowledge this doesn't have to be really hard just document your day to day learnings on Twitter or on Instagram give me it as easy as that and then get started the best advice I can give you is to take imperfect action I love that term because that perfectly captures you know it's not going to be perfect at the start and having the right expectations so for me it took six years but I think that had I been more consistent and maybe more focused on it it would have been shorter for a lot of people that I highlighted in this talk it was about two and a half to three years remember John's tweet and then I have a quote from Steve Jobs that really captures the essence of my talk here you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust the dots will somehow connect in your future you don't you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever this approach has never me down and has made all the difference in my life so by you guys getting out into the community putting yourself out there sharing your knowledge you're in essence putting more dots on the map and you just have to have some faith that those thoughts will connect in some weird unexpected lifechanging way in the future so I've got some of my contact info there if you want to reach out and chat if you guys were thinking about starting your own journey feel free to reach out and contact the info of some of the other people I mentioned in this talk as well thank you so much you guys have been a great audience thank you so much Chris
