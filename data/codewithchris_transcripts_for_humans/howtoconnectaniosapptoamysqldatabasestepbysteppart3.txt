With timestamps:

00:00 - a YouTube versus Chris here and in the
00:07 - previous lesson we went through a
00:08 - diagram illustrating how an iOS app can
00:11 - connect to a MySQL database through a
00:14 - PHP web service so starting from this
00:17 - video we're actually going to implement
00:19 - those things the first step is to find
00:21 - somewhere where we can host our MySQL
00:23 - database and web service so the way I
00:26 - chose to do it in this article was to
00:28 - sign up for web hosting which gives you
00:31 - access to upload files so we can upload
00:35 - our web service as well as create MySQL
00:37 - databases now I want to point out that
00:39 - obviously this option is going to cost
00:41 - money because you're signing up for web
00:43 - hosting but there are tons of other
00:46 - options available for instance if you
00:48 - are savvy web developer you probably
00:51 - have set up a local database server
00:54 - before on your machine or a web server
00:56 - and you can host your own files or maybe
00:59 - if you already have an existing MySQL
01:01 - database and you have access to upload
01:04 - files to that server you can use that as
01:07 - well the reason I chose to do it this
01:09 - way is because it goes back to the days
01:12 - when I was learning how to build
01:14 - websites through HTML CSS and JavaScript
01:17 - and stuff like that and I would need to
01:19 - sign up for web hosting to put up my
01:21 - websites publicly from there I explored
01:24 - MySQL and PHP and that was a long time
01:28 - ago when I did any sort of web
01:30 - development like that these days
01:31 - I'm sure there are other options out
01:34 - there but again I haven't done any sort
01:36 - of web development in a long time so if
01:38 - there are any web developers watching
01:40 - this feel free to comment in the comment
01:44 - section below and maybe you can tell us
01:47 - what the best options are these days or
01:50 - maybe some free options to have access
01:53 - to a MySQL database and a place to
01:55 - upload some files so in this article
01:58 - right here
01:59 - step one is to sign up for that web
02:01 - hosting so I'm not going to go through
02:03 - that because I actually already did sign
02:06 - up for this web hosting when I wrote
02:08 - this article so what I'm going to do is
02:11 - skip to step two and show you
02:13 - how to set up the database once you do
02:15 - have access to one
02:16 - and obviously this setting up the
02:20 - database is going to be in the context
02:22 - of the web host that I have if you
02:25 - signed up for a web host as well and
02:27 - it's not Bluehost it may look a little
02:30 - different but most web hosts these days
02:32 - have some sort of cPanel or
02:34 - administrative panel where you can
02:36 - create new databases and also access and
02:39 - admit panel to manage the database if
02:42 - you do want to sign up through Bluehost
02:44 - like I have it feel free to jump through
02:46 - the link in the description below to go
02:48 - to this article and just follow this
02:50 - section one sign up for web hosting and
02:53 - database and I've provided links to
02:55 - Bluehost there and no extra cost to you
02:58 - I'll earn a commission if you decide to
02:59 - sign up through the links that I've
03:01 - provided here for Bluehost so if you do
03:03 - that thank you for your support and it's
03:05 - going to continue to help me provide
03:07 - free high quality tutorials for you guys
03:09 - ok so anyways let's skip step one here
03:12 - let's jump straight to step two setting
03:14 - up the database again this is in the
03:16 - context of the cPanel or control panel
03:19 - for Bluehost
03:20 - but I'm sure you'll be able to find the
03:22 - options in your own web host so this is
03:25 - what the cPanel for Bluehost looks like
03:27 - I'm going to scroll all the way down
03:29 - here to database tools and click on
03:33 - MySQL databases so this is going to list
03:38 - out all of the current databases I have
03:40 - it's going to redirect me here and it's
03:44 - also going to allow me to create new
03:45 - ones
03:46 - so here I can give a new database a name
03:48 - if there's going to be a little prefix
03:50 - here for the database name I've already
03:54 - created one here I've called it sample
03:56 - DB and the full name is iOS quiz 1
03:58 - underscore sample DB the reason it says
04:02 - iOS quiz 1 is because that's the
04:05 - username that I signed up for
04:07 - for my Bluehost account and the domain
04:11 - is iOS quiz comm so I was in the future
04:14 - I was planning to create some sort of
04:15 - quiz
04:17 - to aid in the learning for iOS
04:19 - programming and so that's why I
04:21 - registered that domain iOS quiz comm
04:24 - okay so what I did here was I created a
04:28 - new database I just typed in sample DB
04:30 - like that and I clicked on create
04:32 - database and that created this guy right
04:34 - here the seconds that we need to do is
04:36 - to create a MySQL user because through
04:40 - that user we query the database we
04:43 - create new rows we delete rows and
04:46 - update and do all sorts of things like
04:48 - that so we do that through a user and in
04:52 - fact the web service that we create will
04:54 - actually use this user account to
04:56 - perform all those operations so what I
04:59 - did here I've already created a user and
05:01 - I called him DV user again there's this
05:05 - prefix here so the full user name would
05:07 - be iOS quiz 1 underscore DB user now you
05:10 - could put anything that you want and I
05:12 - specified a password for it and then I
05:14 - clicked on this button to create a new
05:15 - user and the third step is finally to
05:18 - give access to that user to the sample
05:22 - DB so you can see here that I can select
05:25 - a user I can select a database and I can
05:28 - add that user to the database so when
05:32 - you add a user to a database it's going
05:34 - to ask you what sorts of permissions do
05:36 - you want to give this user towards
05:38 - accessing the database so let me see if
05:41 - I can get back to that screen so that I
05:43 - can show you what that looks like I
05:45 - think maybe if I click here yeah so
05:49 - you're going to see a screen like this
05:50 - and by default all of it would be
05:54 - unchecked right so you're going to have
05:56 - to check off to individual privileges
06:00 - that allows now I'm not sure what the
06:02 - best practices are but just my common
06:05 - sense tells me that I probably should
06:07 - not if this were a production
06:09 - application it should not just
06:11 - willy-nilly give this user all of the
06:14 - privileges because for example some of
06:16 - these are pretty dangerous
06:17 - I think drop right this is for dropping
06:19 - a table so this user would be able to
06:22 - delete complete tables right this would
06:25 - allow them to create my SQL
06:29 - procedures I think that's what they were
06:31 - called in sequel server Microsoft sequel
06:34 - server but here they might be called
06:37 - routines it's been a while since I've
06:39 - worked with those and here you'd be able
06:43 - to create tables and you'd be able to
06:44 - delete rows and stuff like that so it
06:46 - really depends what you're going to be
06:49 - doing with the web services for example
06:52 - if you're only want to read data from
06:54 - the database to your iPhone app then I
06:58 - would say you just need to select write
07:02 - but however if your iOS app is going to
07:06 - be sending commands and sending data to
07:08 - maybe insert rows or update rows then
07:11 - you might need you know update and
07:13 - insert wherever that is there is so for
07:21 - me in doing this demo I didn't really
07:24 - want to bother with any of that so I
07:25 - just enabled everything but I want to
07:27 - make it clear to you that for demo
07:30 - purposes it may be okay but if you know
07:32 - don't use this for production so later
07:34 - on the series I'm going to take a deeper
07:37 - dive with familiarizing myself with what
07:39 - the best practices are for this sort of
07:41 - thing and I will create some additional
07:43 - videos for these series so you know as
07:47 - to show you guys what you should do but
07:50 - for this demo right now just because I
07:52 - want to quickly get the iOS app reading
07:56 - data from the database I don't want to
07:58 - have to worry about privileges so I just
08:00 - enabled everything when I added this
08:02 - user into this database okay so be
08:06 - careful about that okay so after you've
08:11 - done that you've created a new database
08:13 - you've created a new user you've added
08:16 - the user to the database and use you
08:19 - know enabled the proper permissions for
08:22 - that user to access the database you're
08:24 - good to go we're going to go back now to
08:27 - the control panel and we're going to
08:32 - scroll down all the way to database
08:35 - tools again and I'm sure there's a
08:39 - couple of different
08:41 - maybe administrative panels that you can
08:43 - use from here but the one now I'm
08:44 - familiar with using as PHP myadmin
08:47 - so I go ahead and I click that it's
08:50 - going to bring me into sort of a control
08:53 - panel to manage that database ok so this
08:58 - is what it looks like on this left hand
09:00 - side I have the databases you can see
09:03 - iOS quiz 1 underscore sample DB if I
09:06 - click that it might be confusing if
09:10 - you've never worked with MySQL before
09:12 - now this it might be hard to tell but
09:16 - this is a table a database table in my
09:18 - database it's called locations I didn't
09:20 - have this before so in order to create a
09:22 - new table I just typed in the name here
09:25 - so I typed in locations and I had 4
09:29 - columns because I was planning to add
09:31 - for the table for each row I needed a
09:35 - location name I needed a location
09:37 - address and then a lot and along so the
09:41 - coordinates representing where that
09:44 - location is so that's why I chose four
09:46 - columns so after you create your table
09:49 - you can actually click into it and then
09:52 - you can add your columns let me see if I
09:55 - can show you that under structure yeah
09:58 - here see I've added a bunch of these
10:01 - columns here so I've added a name
10:04 - address latitude longitude and there's a
10:07 - data type associated with each column as
10:10 - well now I put varchar' and varchar' is
10:14 - kind of like a variable character can be
10:16 - you know letters or numbers or anything
10:19 - like that and this 50 in brackets
10:22 - decided represents the length of that
10:25 - field so it's going to be up to 50
10:27 - characters long so I put 50 for the name
10:31 - and the address and I put 15 for the
10:34 - coordinates so that's the structure of
10:39 - my locations database table now the next
10:42 - step that I did was I added data to it
10:45 - so you can see here you click browse to
10:48 - browse the data for the table I only
10:50 - have two rows of data one is Apple so
10:54 - the Apple headquarters the address is
10:56 - one Internet loop Cupertino California I
11:00 - don't think they've moved yet or maybe
11:03 - they have so maybe this address wouldn't
11:05 - apply but any case this tutorial was
11:08 - done a while back so this was their
11:10 - address and this was the coordinates for
11:13 - it and this is the Google headquarters
11:17 - so same thing and there's tons of
11:20 - websites out there where you can
11:22 - actually punch in an address and it's
11:24 - going to return to you what the
11:27 - coordinates for that address are so a
11:30 - simple Google query is going to turn up
11:33 - those websites for you you can type in
11:35 - something like get latitude or something
11:37 - like that for address and you're going
11:39 - to see a ton of sites that's that will
11:42 - help you with that okay so that is it
11:45 - for creating the database and populating
11:48 - it with these two rows of data because I
11:50 - did this already I'm sorry I couldn't
11:52 - show you actually step by step but my my
11:56 - tutorial here in step two it has a ton
11:58 - of screenshots and it's going to show
12:00 - you step by step basically how to create
12:04 - that database create that database user
12:06 - then add that user to the database and
12:09 - here you can see how I've enabled all
12:11 - these privileges and then going into
12:15 - phpMyAdmin and creating the table and
12:18 - then creating the columns for it here
12:22 - and then inserting some data into it you
12:25 - can see here really step-by-step
12:28 - instructions there and you can see that
12:30 - we end up in the same place with these
12:33 - two rows of data now in the next step we
12:36 - are going to write the PHP web service
12:39 - to query the database and you're going
12:41 - to see that in the next lesson
12:42 - so thanks for watching and I'll see you
12:44 - next time bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

a YouTube versus Chris here and in the previous lesson we went through a diagram illustrating how an iOS app can connect to a MySQL database through a PHP web service so starting from this video we're actually going to implement those things the first step is to find somewhere where we can host our MySQL database and web service so the way I chose to do it in this article was to sign up for web hosting which gives you access to upload files so we can upload our web service as well as create MySQL databases now I want to point out that obviously this option is going to cost money because you're signing up for web hosting but there are tons of other options available for instance if you are savvy web developer you probably have set up a local database server before on your machine or a web server and you can host your own files or maybe if you already have an existing MySQL database and you have access to upload files to that server you can use that as well the reason I chose to do it this way is because it goes back to the days when I was learning how to build websites through HTML CSS and JavaScript and stuff like that and I would need to sign up for web hosting to put up my websites publicly from there I explored MySQL and PHP and that was a long time ago when I did any sort of web development like that these days I'm sure there are other options out there but again I haven't done any sort of web development in a long time so if there are any web developers watching this feel free to comment in the comment section below and maybe you can tell us what the best options are these days or maybe some free options to have access to a MySQL database and a place to upload some files so in this article right here step one is to sign up for that web hosting so I'm not going to go through that because I actually already did sign up for this web hosting when I wrote this article so what I'm going to do is skip to step two and show you how to set up the database once you do have access to one and obviously this setting up the database is going to be in the context of the web host that I have if you signed up for a web host as well and it's not Bluehost it may look a little different but most web hosts these days have some sort of cPanel or administrative panel where you can create new databases and also access and admit panel to manage the database if you do want to sign up through Bluehost like I have it feel free to jump through the link in the description below to go to this article and just follow this section one sign up for web hosting and database and I've provided links to Bluehost there and no extra cost to you I'll earn a commission if you decide to sign up through the links that I've provided here for Bluehost so if you do that thank you for your support and it's going to continue to help me provide free high quality tutorials for you guys ok so anyways let's skip step one here let's jump straight to step two setting up the database again this is in the context of the cPanel or control panel for Bluehost but I'm sure you'll be able to find the options in your own web host so this is what the cPanel for Bluehost looks like I'm going to scroll all the way down here to database tools and click on MySQL databases so this is going to list out all of the current databases I have it's going to redirect me here and it's also going to allow me to create new ones so here I can give a new database a name if there's going to be a little prefix here for the database name I've already created one here I've called it sample
