00:01 - hey guys what's up it's chris from code
with chris dot com
00:05 - here with your very first
00:07 - video series
00:09 - called how to build your first iphone
application
00:13 - and my goal with this YouTube channel
is
00:16 - exactly like it sounds to teach you guys
how to build iPhone and iPad apps
00:21 - this first video series
00:24 - is going to teach you guys the basic
skills and get you guys familiar with
00:27 - xcode
00:28 - it's going to be about
00:30 - eight videos long i think
00:33 - and by the end of it
00:34 - you're going to know
00:36 - basic skills like
00:38 - creating buttons and
00:40 - creating composite views
00:42 - learning what
00:44 - app architecture means in iOS
00:48 - uh... how to hook up handlers and using
delegates and stuff like that
00:51 - so
00:52 - in this particular video we're actually
going to
00:57 - take a look at what we will be building for
the next eight or ten videos; I have the demo
01:01 - ready
01:02 - and i will tell you guys where to download
XCode, so you can
01:06 - get your environment setup
01:08 - and then we will
01:09 - go and set up on our first XCode project
01:13 - so let's get started!
01:18 - So this is a demo of what we will be building.
It's a dice roll simulator
01:23 - and as you can see, all that does 
when you click the roll button is
01:27 - randomly generate
01:29 - two random numbers between one to six
and then
01:33 - show their dice representation on the
screen
01:36 - So it's a pretty simple application
but it's going to serve the purpose of
01:40 - teaching you the basics of iOS app
architecture
01:44 - some objective c basics as well as
01:48 - getting familiar with the xcode so by
the end of
01:51 - this video tutorial series
01:53 - you're going to know how to handle button
clicks
01:56 - and how to build an iphone view
comprised of smaller views, you're going
02:01 - to know how to load images
02:03 - and
02:04 - show text labels
02:05 - stuff like that
02:07 - in terms of environment, you don't
even need
02:11 - an actual iOS device at this
point. All you really need is a Mac.
02:17 - You need to download XCode which
is free
02:19 - and as you can see during your
development phase you can use this
02:23 - simulator that comes with XCode
02:25 - to
02:26 - to load up your app to see how it's
working and stuff and
02:29 - it comes with
02:31 - all sorts of cool features like
you can rotate it you can you can
02:34 - simulate shake, you can simulate memory
warnings and
02:38 - you can even
02:39 - you can even put in a custom location
02:42 - if you wanted to debug
02:44 - GPS specific functionalities.
02:48 - Okay so
02:50 - the easiest way to get XCode is
to download it from the app store
02:55 - you can search for XCode and it's
gonna show up as first result
02:59 - If you
03:01 - don't have the Mac App Store for any
reason you can still download
03:05 - the
03:07 - image.
03:07 - So all you need to do is
03:10 - hit this URL right here.
03:13 - You're going to have to sign up for a
03:15 - a free
03:16 - developer account
03:18 - and
03:19 - once you do you're going to be able to
access this page and download
03:23 - this image right here.
03:24 - XCode 4.5.2 is the
latest one.
03:31 - So once you have xcode installed
03:33 - let's go ahead and launch it
03:36 - and make sure you pull down the menu
here
03:39 - and go to "About XCode" just to
doublecheck what version you're running.
03:43 - As of the time of this video, the
latest version is 4.5.2
03:47 - And just make sure you're not
running anything older than that
03:52 - because sometimes your Mac may come
pre-installed with
03:55 - XCode. Or maybe you've bought a
used mac which already has xcode
03:59 - and then sometimes
04:01 - you'll have two icons and you'll end up using
the wrong one.
04:06 - So just make sure you're using the latest version.
04:09 - And when you launch XCode you may
see a welcome to XCode menu.
04:13 - In my case i don't have that
04:16 - but if you do have that you're gonna see
a button that says "create new project".
04:20 - so go ahead and click that. For me, i'm going to
go through the menu system
04:23 - which will be the same thing so
i'm gonna create new project here
04:27 - It's going to bring up a window
04:29 - that allows you to select a couple of
templates just a start off your
04:33 - iOS project.
04:35 - and make sure that you're under the iOS heading
04:38 - and under "Application"
04:41 - so there's a bunch of different
04:43 - templates you can use and you
might recognize some of them especially
04:46 - the tabbed application which is very common
in the app store
04:52 - but for our
04:54 - demo dice roll app, we're going to use a
single view application.
05:01 - Here you're specifying a couple
properties for your project. You can
05:04 - change these later but
05:05 - for now,
05:06 - give your demo app a name. I'm going to name
mine "iPhone App Tutorial"
05:13 - For organization, you can put your own name
and for company identifier
05:16 - this is going to be really important when
you start to deploy your applications
05:21 - to devices and stuff like that
05:23 - because
05:25 - once we get into provisioning
and
05:29 - basically setting up our app
05:31 - to deploy our on real devices
05:33 - it's going to matter.
05:36 - What this is, is going to matter.
Normally, the convention is going to be a
05:40 - top level identifier
05:42 - and then a secondary one and finally your
app name.
05:49 - You can select
05:51 - what type of devices you want this to run
on
05:53 - and again
05:55 - selecting one doesn't mean that
05:58 - it won't be able to run on
06:00 - the other.
06:02 - You can always tweak these settings in
the build settings,
06:06 - the project properties later.
06:08 - And what's more is that, let's say I
select
06:11 - iPhone and then I wanted to
06:14 - also allow this run on iPad to have
iPad specific views, i could definitely
06:19 - add iPad specific views and change my
project settings later to allow it to run
06:24 - on iPad. So don't feel like
this is set in stone.
06:28 - But for our demo we're going to select
iphone.
06:32 - We're going to leave
06:34 - "use storyboards" checked off.
06:36 - And maybe in the future, i'll do a tutorial
on how to use story boards.
06:40 - You definitely want to have "use
automatic reference counting" checked.
06:46 - You guys might have heard
06:47 - back then before
06:49 - iOS5,
06:52 - developers
06:54 - had to manage their own memory and that was a
huge barrier for people learning
06:58 - objective c and iphone/ipad development
but nowadays, we can have
07:02 - xcode automatically do that for us so
07:05 - go ahead and have that checked off and
you can leave unit tests
07:11 - checked.. unchecked i mean.
07:13 - Click next; its going to ask you where
to save it
07:21 - and
07:22 - there we go! We have our project created.
07:25 - By default it's going to dump everything
in the root folder and i usually like to
07:30 - organize this a little bit better.
07:32 - I think I'll go through that in the
next video.
07:35 - For now, all i want you guys to do is
07:37 - in this top menu right here
07:42 - choose iphone 6 simulator and then
just hit "Run"
07:46 - to see that simulator pop up and see
your app.
07:50 - So there you go,
07:51 - you don't have anything in this
application right now so it's showing you an empty
07:54 - screen.
07:55 - But that's
07:56 - pretty much our "hello world".
07:58 - So i'm gonna end the video off there
08:01 - and look forward to the next one where i
will
08:04 - it'll probably be about showing you guys
08:07 - all the different parts of xcode
08:09 - and getting you familiar with that
and maybe revising some of how
08:14 - this is structured here and organizing
the project.
08:18 - Alright until next time;
08:20 - Make sure to comment and subscribe.
08:22 - Comment especially if you have some
questions and you have stuff you don't
08:26 - understand. That's where i'll be
checking and answering your questions.
08:30 - And please follow along if you want to
get the most out of this.
08:33 - Okay until next time. Bye!
