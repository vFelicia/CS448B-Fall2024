00:03 - you code Faster by letting you annotate
00:05 - your code for common patterns and coding
00:08 - instead of typing the whole thing out
00:10 - and the other cool thing is that you can
00:11 - create your own macros and share them
00:13 - with other developers through Swift
00:15 - packages now this is one Improvement

00:18 - every single day no matter what Apple
00:21 - platform you're developing on and I
00:23 - think that is awesome however one
00:25 - downside that I can see is that this is
00:27 - going to make reading Swift Code even
00:29 - more cryptic for beginners who are
00:31 - learning for the first time because now
00:33 - there is code that's hidden behind
00:35 - macros and if they don't know that it's
