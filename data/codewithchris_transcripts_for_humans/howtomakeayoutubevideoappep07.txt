00:04 - pay coders what's up Chris here with
00:07 - episode 7 of how to make a youtube video
00:10 - app in the previous lesson we had
00:13 - created these video thumbnail labels
00:15 - Plus this little dimmed background
00:18 - covering the label so you can see it and
00:20 - we increased the resolution of the video
00:23 - thumbnails by downloading the correct
00:26 - one so thank you to commenter strange
00:29 - productions for that tip on how to get
00:32 - the higher-quality thumbnail in this
00:34 - lesson we're going to work on clicking a
00:36 - video selecting a video to go to another
00:39 - view and I just noticed that clicking a
00:42 - thumbnail actually kind of removes that
00:44 - UI view in there so let's fix that first
00:47 - of all let's go into the storyboard and
00:49 - how we would fix that is if we click our
00:52 - basic cell right here in the document
00:55 - outline and for the selection let's
00:58 - choose none instead of the default is
01:00 - blue so let's run it again and see what
01:02 - happens ok so now it's good it's not
01:06 - doing that weird selection highlight ok
01:09 - so now what we want to do in order to
01:12 - navigate to another view is we're going
01:14 - to use what's called a navigation
01:16 - controller and it's just one of the ways
01:18 - that we can handle navigation in an iOS
01:21 - app but in this case it's going to be
01:22 - pretty simple for our two view
01:25 - controller application so our main view
01:28 - controller let me just close this
01:29 - document outline so we can see a little
01:31 - better this is the main view controller
01:33 - we have here the scrollable list or the
01:35 - table view of the videos and our second
01:38 - view controller is going to be the
01:40 - detail one when we select a particular
01:42 - video and that detailed view controller
01:44 - is going to show the actual video in the
01:47 - description so what we're going to do
01:50 - here is click this little white bar of
01:52 - the view controller so we make sure it's
01:55 - highlighted alternatively from the
01:56 - document outline you can select the view
01:59 - controller right here actually when you
02:01 - select that make sure it highlights in
02:03 - blue like that or click the view
02:05 - controller here go up to the menu I'm
02:08 - gonna go to editor embed in and choose
02:12 - navigation controller
02:13 - and when you do that let's just double
02:16 - click here to zoom out when you do that
02:19 - you'll notice that it added what's
02:21 - called a navigation controller and you
02:24 - see this little line pointing to our
02:27 - main view controller with the scrollable
02:30 - list of videos and also notice that this
02:33 - arrow I mentioned in the first lesson or
02:35 - second lesson that this dictates where
02:37 - the starting point is you'll notice that
02:39 - now it points to the navigation
02:40 - controller so this guy here actually
02:43 - controls what is being shown to the user
02:45 - it can keep track of a bunch of view
02:48 - controllers and it can manage the
02:49 - transitions in between them so right now
02:52 - the navigation controllers root view
02:55 - controller is this main view controller
02:58 - we've got here so this is going to be
03:01 - the first view that people see and if
03:03 - you run the app now you're not really
03:05 - going to see any difference well you do
03:07 - see that navigation header there so we
03:11 - can customize that a little bit later
03:12 - nothing happens still when we click
03:15 - these video thumbnails gonna stop it
03:17 - we're gonna add the second screen now so
03:18 - that's really exciting because we're
03:21 - going to get to navigate in between them
03:23 - very very soon so in here in the object
03:27 - library just search for view controller
03:29 - there's going to be a whole bunch but
03:30 - you want to select this top one that
03:32 - simply says view controller and what you
03:34 - want to do is drag it onto your
03:37 - storyboard it's gonna get a little
03:39 - crowded so what you can do is double
03:42 - click to zoom out and then just
03:45 - rearrange it there so I'm just gonna put
03:46 - it up here on top of the the main view
03:49 - controller there so how do we get it so
03:51 - that when we click a video it goes to
03:54 - this second view controller that we have
03:56 - here well what we're going to do is draw
03:59 - a little arrow just like this one here
04:01 - where the view controller is pointing to
04:03 - our main view controller and draw a
04:05 - little arrow from this view controller
04:07 - to the one that we just added and we
04:09 - want that little arrow to happen that
04:12 - indicates a transition we want that
04:14 - transition to happen when the user
04:16 - selects a cell okay so I'm gonna double
04:19 - click the empty area to kind of drill
04:21 - back in now what we're going to do is
04:23 - select the cell and
04:26 - actually I'm gonna sell like the sell
04:27 - because I click the sell here but I'm
04:29 - actually selected my image view so as
04:32 - you can see in the document outline want
04:34 - to make sure that we select the basic
04:35 - sell so I'm gonna hold down ctrl on my
04:38 - keyboard and while holding down ctrl I'm
04:40 - going to click and drag and then you'll
04:43 - see a little blue line start to follow
04:45 - your basic sell so we're gonna drag it
04:47 - all the way up here in the document line
04:49 - to this view controller line and this is
04:51 - the view controller that we just added
04:52 - I'm gonna let go
04:54 - you're gonna see a little menu pop up
04:55 - and under selection segue we're gonna
04:59 - choose show ok so selection segue is
05:03 - when that cell is selected we're going
05:06 - to transition to this view controller
05:08 - when you select show you'll see that
05:10 - this little arrow is drawn you see the
05:13 - little arrow there it's kind of hiding
05:15 - behind behind it ok so let's see how
05:18 - that effects the app I'm going to run it
05:20 - right now and then now when we select a
05:26 - video cell it transitions to our second
05:30 - view controller and it also has this
05:32 - little back button for us to go back so
05:34 - at this point no matter what video cell
05:36 - we select it goes to that view
05:38 - controller in the next lesson we're
05:40 - going to customize this detail view so
05:44 - that we can show a video thumbnail and a
05:47 - description so it was a short video
05:49 - today I'm sure you guys all have Black
05:51 - Friday deals to get to I know I do I'll
05:54 - see you guys on Monday at 12 p.m.
05:57 - Eastern have a great weekend talk to you
05:59 - then bye bye
