With timestamps:

00:09 - hello hello
00:11 - can you guys hear me
00:14 - and there's a little bit of a delay
00:26 - hello hello can you guys hear me is the
00:28 - audio good can you see me
00:54 - so today i wanted to take you guys
00:56 - through some of the behind the scenes
00:58 - with code with chris
01:00 - and show you a little bit about
01:03 - how we plan our content and how we
01:05 - create it and how different members of
01:07 - the team come together
01:09 - and get it done and publish the youtube
01:11 - videos that you guys watch
01:13 - in addition to that i wanted to talk a
01:15 - little bit about an app that we're
01:16 - building and show you the process that
01:18 - we're going through
01:20 - and then also if you've been following
01:22 - the channel for a while
01:24 - you'll know that we built an instagram
01:26 - analytics app
01:28 - uh for a three month case study and we
01:31 - i gave a couple of updates on youtube
01:33 - before
01:34 - so i want to give you guys and a look
01:36 - into our app store analytics for that
01:38 - app
01:39 - and to show you how that's doing
01:44 - all right
01:48 - hello so you'll notice that streaming in
01:51 - 1080p now
01:54 - but my computer actually if i open xcode
01:56 - and i run it
01:58 - it's really going to choke and die all
02:08 - right so we have some offending members
02:10 - in the chat
02:11 - hi call of programming how are you doing
02:13 - hi angelo
02:14 - hi nice to see you
02:27 - coding along today cool angelo nice to
02:30 - see you
02:30 - hey tutor hey june
02:33 - ah so do you use an m1 mac
02:36 - so i was just talking about this right
02:38 - now this is actually a pretty old
02:40 - imac and up until now it's suited my
02:43 - needs fine because i have a ton of ram
02:46 - and um it's like a mid 2015
02:49 - i5 quad core mac with 32 gigs of ram
02:54 - so i've been loving the retina the 5k
02:56 - retina screen and it's
02:58 - been fine but now that i'm starting to
03:00 - stream
03:01 - and i realized that i wasn't streaming
03:03 - in 1080p
03:04 - before it was just 720 and and even the
03:08 - replays
03:09 - right were not in 1080p and i was like
03:12 - that
03:12 - i can't have that i need at least 1080p
03:15 - so i
03:15 - tested out streaming over the weekend in
03:18 - 1080p
03:19 - so my bandwidth is completely fine but
03:21 - my computer actually
03:22 - chokes when um i run xcode so right now
03:26 - the stream is 1080p you guys will
03:29 - be able to switch that on to that level
03:32 - but as soon as i launch xcode
03:35 - and i try to build a project it
03:38 - the cpu tanks and then you get buffering
03:41 - and
03:42 - all that stuff so today because i am
03:44 - just showing you guys sort of behind the
03:46 - scenes
03:47 - and how our company works together to
03:49 - produce content to produce apps
03:51 - and give you some app updates on uh the
03:55 - instagram analytics app showing you some
03:57 - app store
03:58 - uh analytics i want to show you guys
04:01 - what we're planning for the cwc app
04:03 - and how we're going about executing it
04:06 - because this would have been the second
04:08 - app that we built as a company
04:09 - and so we've learned lessons from
04:12 - building the instagram analytics app
04:14 - so we're going to do things a little
04:15 - differently i want to share that with
04:16 - you
04:20 - yeah but oh i forgot the second part
04:22 - june park you asked me if i had an m1
04:24 - mac um so i am getting one in because
04:28 - of what i just told you i do want to be
04:32 - able to show you guys
04:33 - you know building apps and writing code
04:36 - and
04:36 - you know doing stuff in xcode and still
04:39 - stream in 1080p so i do have a mac
04:42 - coming in and speaking of which
04:45 - i haven't actually ordered it yet i want
04:47 - to get your opinion
04:49 - and i you know i already have in my mind
04:52 - what i want to do
04:54 - um but anyways it's got to be m1 the
04:56 - performance is there i looked at
04:58 - geekbench scores right now i'm using a
05:02 - 27
05:03 - uh inch imac i love this screen right
05:07 - problem is no n1 chip for this just yet
05:10 - however if we take a look at
05:13 - these ones right here
05:18 - you know shiny and new cool colors
05:22 - um i was gonna get the the green one
05:25 - i wanted i don't know i know my brand is
05:27 - blue
05:28 - but i i think green is really soothing
05:30 - you know like plants
05:32 - botanical green so i was really leaning
05:34 - towards this green one
05:36 - the only thing that really held me back
05:38 - was this 24 inch
05:40 - display uh and the viewable area for
05:43 - this is actually only 21 inches
05:45 - and so the viewable area for my imac
05:48 - right now is 27 inches
05:50 - and i don't know if i can i can do i can
05:52 - go from that level to that level and so
05:55 - i decided that i will probably
06:00 - order a mac mini today i'll probably
06:03 - place the order today and i will
06:06 - probably
06:09 - upgrade the the ram on this guy
06:12 - and also the hard drive because right
06:15 - now
06:16 - uh for the ssd right now this imac has
06:19 - ssd but it's only
06:20 - 250 so i'm constantly running out of
06:22 - space especially
06:23 - you know producing large videos um for
06:26 - for production and post editing
06:29 - so i'll probably upgrade this and
06:32 - probably get 16
06:34 - gigabytes now the nice thing about the
06:37 - mac mini is that in the future when i
06:40 - need to upgrade this machine again
06:42 - um i don't have to replace the monitor
06:45 - right i can get a nice
06:47 - beautiful big monitor and then i can
06:49 - just swap out
06:50 - the mac mini itself right now with this
06:52 - imac i i love the screen
06:54 - but the specs really um starting to feel
06:58 - lacking especially with the streaming in
07:01 - 1080p
07:02 - so this is probably what i'm going to go
07:03 - with and then buy a monitor
07:05 - and it says that it won't get delivered
07:09 - until
07:09 - that's actually really fast so i'll
07:11 - probably get it pretty soon and then
07:12 - i'll be streaming in 1080p
07:14 - i can compile the next code and there
07:16 - won't be any performance bumps
07:17 - anyways i went on a rant there
07:20 - yeah yeah call of programming
07:24 - we you are going to see the analytics of
07:26 - the app today
07:27 - i'll probably do that a little later on
07:29 - in the stream if you uh can't wait for
07:31 - that if you need to go
07:32 - this replay will always be up
07:38 - serdar yeah the the imac with the m1
07:41 - chip beautiful machine and display
07:43 - especially orange
07:44 - color yeah why don't you guys tell me in
07:45 - the chat right now what color
07:48 - would you get if you were to get one of
07:50 - these what is your favorite
07:51 - color right here
07:56 - it's crazy how thin these are
07:59 - it's crazy thin
08:06 - david i would ha you have the mac mini
08:08 - would highly recommend it i'm glad
08:10 - i'm glad to hear that
08:14 - rose um 2018 macbook pro i love my
08:17 - macbook pro
08:18 - oh 2019. yeah these machines
08:21 - like i i don't know the the machines
08:24 - that at least
08:25 - i've bought from apple have lasted
08:27 - pretty long
08:29 - they've done pretty well i would say
08:30 - it's a good investment for those people
08:33 - you know where their budget fits
08:41 - and blue blue forever blue or white a
08:43 - lot of blue
08:44 - yeah i think i guess apple did their
08:46 - research because blue is
08:48 - uh their default color here i think most
08:50 - people
08:52 - blue orange oranges is unique i think
08:55 - this will definitely stand out if you
08:56 - get an
08:56 - orange or yellow one or even a red one
08:58 - because you don't normally see those
09:00 - right
09:01 - these would be equivalent to you know
09:04 - driving those super cars with the flashy
09:06 - colors
09:08 - that's what this would be
09:13 - june park you bought the cwc plus course
09:16 - and loving it
09:17 - are the swift ui database courses still
09:19 - in progress yeah
09:20 - ashley asha just updated the road map so
09:23 - if you go to the road map right here
09:26 - i'm working on lessons two and three
09:29 - today so lesson one has been it's not
09:32 - been published but it's ready to be
09:34 - published
09:34 - but we're thinking that after we work on
09:36 - lessons two and three
09:37 - which will probably get published
09:39 - sometime tomorrow
09:41 - if i work on them today then we'll
09:43 - publish all three at once
09:44 - so really pushing to get this done
09:53 - uh matt s if you're getting an m1
09:54 - macbook for coding definitely need the
09:56 - 16 gigs of ram right
09:58 - um maybe someone in the chat can also
10:00 - chime in tutor you have an
10:02 - m1 macbook air did you upgrade the ram
10:05 - for me
10:05 - i would personally say if you can afford
10:07 - it i would say yes it just
10:09 - extends the life of your machine longer
10:11 - like for this one
10:13 - i've used this machine for
10:17 - you know since i didn't buy it in 2015 i
10:20 - actually bought this mid 2015
10:22 - imac in about 2017 so it still lasted
10:25 - like
10:26 - four four years for me um with good
10:29 - performance too
10:30 - like it doesn't lag in xcode
10:33 - or anything like that and i would
10:34 - honestly continue using this machine if
10:37 - not
10:37 - for the fact of streaming in 1080p and
10:40 - xcode don't really play nice together
10:43 - with this
10:43 - configuration here
10:48 - splash route yeah you think my imac at
10:50 - this this level wouldn't be able to run
10:53 - mac os monterey you might be right i
10:55 - haven't installed the beta yet
10:56 - but i'm glad i'm making the jump to
10:58 - upgrade
11:00 - and i'm thinking that i won't need to
11:02 - for another at least
11:03 - three four years hopefully yeah that's
11:06 - the thing with apple with
11:08 - you know when you buy a brand new iphone
11:10 - it's blazing fast and
11:11 - over time as you get the updates it just
11:13 - gets slower and slower
11:15 - until the point you want to upgrade but
11:17 - even those
11:18 - they last i've been using my iphone for
11:22 - a good three years i would say
11:27 - yeah uh this one is
11:30 - uh what is what is my iphone hold on let
11:32 - me check
11:34 - all right but i haven't upgraded this in
11:36 - a while
11:39 - it's an oh it's an iphone xs
11:43 - max yeah i think that was the
11:47 - year they came up with these weird
11:48 - naming conventions yeah started with the
11:51 - iphone x
11:51 - and then xs and xs masks
11:56 - but anyways okay let's get started i
11:58 - want to jump into
12:00 - a ton of things to show you guys today
12:02 - so a little preview of the analytics
12:04 - there
12:05 - let me just first show you what i have
12:08 - here so i made the font really big
12:11 - hopefully you guys can see that
12:15 - okay so this is a tool called
12:17 - mondaymonday.com
12:19 - and sometimes it's really confusing to
12:20 - say to people
12:22 - put it on monday because it's also a day
12:25 - but
12:26 - um over the years we've started building
12:28 - our team at first it was just
12:30 - myself and then we had our video editor
12:33 - adrian
12:33 - so he right now edits all the course
12:36 - videos and the youtube videos and
12:38 - in the beginning it was really easy to
12:39 - work together we just actually
12:41 - communicated through twitter dms and we
12:44 - didn't really need a project management
12:47 - sort of tool before and so when we were
12:50 - starting to consider these tools we
12:52 - actually
12:52 - went through a whole bunch of things
12:54 - before landing on this one which suited
12:56 - our needs
12:57 - so i'm not going to walk you through
13:01 - like
13:01 - every single board here but in general
13:04 - things start
13:05 - here in our planning board um and
13:09 - we have a bunch of templates depending
13:11 - on what we're working on
13:13 - so for example in the youtube video
13:15 - template
13:16 - you see that there's a whole bunch like
13:18 - a checklist a whole bunch of things to
13:20 - do so we duplicate one of these
13:23 - and we put it into this group called
13:26 - scoping
13:27 - so here are a bunch of things that we're
13:28 - thinking that would most likely do
13:31 - and here we're talking about um
13:34 - just planning out what we're gonna cover
13:36 - and things like that
13:43 - and in addition just to go back to the
13:46 - road map oh i actually closed it but you
13:49 - know this road map that i showed you
13:50 - guys here
13:53 - there is an updates and also
13:57 - an ideas tab so when you come here and
14:00 - you
14:00 - submit an idea you can also
14:03 - vote on other people's ideas and
14:07 - we we look at this right to drive what
14:10 - we're going to create in terms of
14:11 - content
14:12 - in part in addition to the other things
14:15 - that we want to create so this one
14:16 - responsive design
14:18 - is on the roadmap and i'm working on
14:20 - that one
14:22 - um but yeah that's sort of what happens
14:24 - here
14:25 - so in the produce tab it goes from
14:28 - planning once we scoped it out it goes
14:30 - into this produce board
14:32 - and this is where it sort of flows from
14:34 - top down this is the workflow
14:36 - it goes from here goes down down down
14:39 - into
14:40 - release promote for the newsletter and
14:42 - there are different members of the team
14:44 - that work
14:45 - in in parallel and in different
14:48 - areas for this so usually that video
14:51 - or that topic will come into development
14:53 - and design where we're going to be
14:55 - building or designing right and then it
14:58 - goes into lesson planning
15:01 - so let me drill into one of these and
15:03 - you can assign the person here you can
15:04 - assign a status as you can see
15:06 - i need to do a code review for this
15:08 - monthly app challenge right here
15:11 - and we are also working on surfacing all
15:13 - of the cwc stories
15:15 - so i was um
15:18 - promoting this campaign pretty heavily
15:20 - before
15:22 - so let me just show you what this would
15:25 - look like normally
15:26 - uh we use figma for all of our graphics
15:29 - stuff
15:30 - so we usually have a link to a figma
15:34 - file
15:34 - so this is what this landing page is
15:36 - going to look like and we're featuring
15:38 - basically all of your stories some of
15:40 - you actually might be in the stream
15:42 - right now
15:43 - and just telling us your story so we're
15:45 - gonna surface
15:46 - those beautiful stories on a landing
15:49 - page so that's what this project is
15:51 - about
15:52 - um here you can see in the lesson lesson
15:55 - planning
15:55 - phase um uh we are
15:59 - trying to flesh out these lessons and
16:01 - trying to get them out the door
16:03 - it starts with planning the lesson which
16:04 - is um for me
16:08 - writing an intro writing and conclusion
16:10 - uh
16:11 - which are usually just a couple of lines
16:13 - anyways and then planning
16:14 - in bullet point form what i want to
16:17 - cover
16:17 - in that lesson um and then usually when
16:20 - you click into one of these
16:22 - we'll have a figma file for all of the
16:24 - graphic assets for that lesson
16:26 - and also a google doc for the
16:29 - either the script if there is like a lot
16:31 - of talking
16:32 - i'll usually script it um but then as
16:36 - i'm delivering it and i'm recording it
16:38 - i won't read it word for word because
16:39 - it's really hard to stare at the camera
16:41 - and read
16:42 - so i'll get the gist of it and then i
16:45 - will
16:46 - use my own words that's usually how it
16:47 - goes but for these
16:49 - these ones for example
16:54 - let's see if i can find another one
16:57 - yeah so this one i'm working on today
17:00 - and this is in the production phase so
17:02 - i'm actually recording it or i'm writing
17:04 - it
17:04 - it depends if it's like a blog article
17:06 - that would be writing
17:08 - if it's a video i'll be recording it so
17:10 - just a couple of
17:12 - lessons or sorry a couple of sentences
17:14 - for the intro and the outro
17:16 - and then in the screencast section i'll
17:18 - write some bullet points on what i want
17:20 - to cover
17:24 - and then from production it goes into
17:26 - post-production where
17:27 - this is where adrian does most of his
17:29 - work where he'll
17:31 - actually edit the video and
17:34 - he will then assign it to me for review
17:36 - so let me show you
17:38 - what what that might look like
17:47 - so we have a shared dropbox and he'll
17:49 - put it in here
17:50 - and then he'll cut me a copy for review
17:53 - so this video is actually coming out
17:55 - soon
17:55 - uh on the channel and it is where you
17:58 - guys gave me advice
18:00 - on well you guys told me what advice you
18:03 - would give
18:04 - to someone who's just starting out
18:06 - learning ios app development so i
18:08 - took a uh i read all of your pieces of
18:11 - advice and i
18:12 - commented on them and just gave my
18:14 - feedback and
18:15 - my opinion on it so that's coming out
18:19 - so for that you know i have reviewed it
18:22 - this morning so
18:23 - i would go set it ready to start and
18:25 - then i would assign it to adrian
18:27 - and i would just tell them
18:40 - we would check those off and so see
18:42 - there's a process
18:43 - as um the business gets larger and we're
18:47 - starting to produce more content
18:49 - uh this this stuff was all new to me to
18:51 - be honest it just started
18:52 - out initially as me right filming
18:56 - something
18:56 - on the computer editing it and then
19:00 - pushing it out onto youtube but now
19:02 - it's become this giant workflow
19:06 - where multiple people work on it so it's
19:09 - really
19:10 - amazing to see and for me personally i
19:13 - you know i didn't take business in
19:14 - school i don't know
19:16 - how to manage it you know manage my team
19:19 - effectively
19:20 - manage a business and this is all a
19:22 - learning process so it's really cool
19:26 - waiting to be released there's a whole
19:27 - bunch of stuff actually that i haven't
19:28 - got to releasing just yet
19:33 - you'll see that our designer has been
19:35 - working on some
19:37 - design course materials as well so
19:42 - we're stepping up our production game i
19:44 - also
19:45 - hope to probably hire another person
19:48 - later this year
19:50 - that would be really cool if we can get
19:52 - some more people
19:53 - producing content um i've also been
19:56 - thinking about how you guys
19:58 - as part of the community like we all
19:59 - have something to teach right
20:01 - um you might think you're a beginner but
20:03 - there i bet you there's someone who
20:05 - is even below you just starting out and
20:08 - wants to know what you know
20:10 - so we can all um create the content and
20:13 - that's only going to strengthen the ios
20:14 - community
20:15 - so i'm thinking about some way to
20:18 - uh really highlight the community
20:22 - and um you know to get the community
20:26 - teaching and sharing
20:27 - i'm not exactly sure how to do that just
20:29 - yet but i think that would
20:30 - be really cool okay
20:34 - so that's basically the two main boards
20:36 - aside from that
20:38 - we have a community board where arthur
20:41 - who is our customer success person uh at
20:44 - code with chris
20:45 - basically handles a lot of the social
20:48 - comments so you you've probably seen him
20:50 - and francis
20:51 - uh work together to answer
20:54 - youtube comments and like instagram
20:56 - comments and all of that stuff sometimes
20:58 - i'll step in and also help out
21:00 - but there's no way i can keep up with
21:03 - all of the messages
21:04 - and we have a rule here that we try to
21:07 - answer
21:08 - every single person so every single like
21:10 - comment
21:11 - dm website message instagram
21:15 - dm youtube comment we try to answer
21:17 - everybody
21:18 - and you know we we might not always
21:20 - succeed
21:21 - but i think we do a pretty good job of
21:24 - it
21:25 - so there's also um yeah also our forum
21:29 - as well
21:30 - which we try to answer everyone and we
21:32 - have a wonderful
21:34 - code crew team uh which david ravinsky
21:37 - is part of the chat he's part of a team
21:39 - code crew
21:40 - and he you can find him in the code crew
21:42 - forum helping people out as well we have
21:44 - chris parker michaela
21:46 - mark spalding and a whole bunch of other
21:49 - members that
21:50 - help each other out so our forum
21:53 - codecrew.codewithchris.com
21:54 - really helpful place
21:59 - direct asserter
22:02 - have you a direct link for articles on
22:05 - your
22:06 - site um this one's kind of tough like
22:09 - we've written so much
22:10 - things over the years that
22:13 - i'm i'm really having trouble trying to
22:15 - surface them all
22:17 - um so my latest attempt and this is ever
22:20 - evolving
22:21 - is if you hit learn up here you're going
22:25 - to see
22:26 - uh first of all some resources that we
22:29 - want to highlight
22:30 - and then an index of you know our
22:32 - courses and where you can find things
22:34 - but down here
22:35 - um i've tried to cherry pick all of the
22:38 - articles that are still
22:39 - sort of relevant and not super out of
22:41 - date and list them here
22:43 - i know it's just a long list that
22:46 - might be kind of hard to go through but
22:48 - at this point this is
22:50 - this is what we have this is the best
22:52 - that we've done
22:54 - so far if you can think of another way
22:57 - to organize it
22:58 - let me know maybe we can split it up
22:59 - into um
23:02 - yeah i don't know maybe i should check
23:04 - out
23:05 - how what other people do um other
23:07 - content creators who have
23:09 - a ton of articles and how they organize
23:11 - it because definitely
23:13 - you know in addition to the website
23:14 - articles i have youtube videos too so
23:16 - how do they play
23:20 - together
23:28 - jira is a good tool for agile
23:30 - methodologies using scrum
23:32 - it's a continuous integration type of
23:34 - management yeah i think
23:36 - you know i haven't personally used jira
23:39 - for agile
23:40 - but i think in our old company when i
23:43 - used to be working
23:44 - professionally still we were exploring
23:48 - jira
23:50 - june chris do you have plans for a
23:51 - combined tutorial uh
23:54 - yeah i think i will eventually right now
23:55 - i'm still in the process of learning it
23:57 - um and i'm using mark mark moykins from
24:01 - big mountain studio his um
24:03 - his combined resource which makes it
24:05 - really easy to learn
24:08 - so combine i mean this this book is
24:13 - not um it's not super cheap
24:16 - but for someone who uh could actually
24:19 - use combine in their workplace
24:21 - i definitely think it's worth it
24:25 - guys give me a second here
24:57 - hello sorry guys back so uh my daughter
25:00 - was just looking for mommy
25:02 - and uh
25:05 - okay so what were we talking about here
25:09 - i think i was just answering questions
25:11 - yeah
25:13 - okay the other thing i wanted to show
25:14 - you here let's transition
25:16 - over to
25:21 - the cwc app so just to give you guys a
25:25 - little bit of
25:26 - context right now in the app store we do
25:28 - have a code with chris app
25:30 - but it's showing the ui kit tutorials
25:33 - and actually
25:35 - david ravinsky in this chat he's the one
25:36 - who built it for us
25:38 - so kudos to him um
25:42 - mark my kids no problem no problem i i
25:44 - constantly use your
25:46 - uh use your book so you know it's it's
25:49 - not a shout out without merit
25:51 - and yeah so i was talking about the cwc
25:54 - app we had some requests from cwc plus
25:58 - members that
26:00 - you know with these streaming platforms
26:02 - to learn
26:03 - sometimes you go on a plane sometimes
26:05 - you go on a train sometimes you're just
26:06 - disconnected and you want to be able to
26:08 - download
26:09 - the videos for offline access just like
26:12 - netflix or skillshare and whatnot
26:14 - and so we're looking into well we're
26:17 - kind of full into it
26:18 - building an app a cwc app
26:22 - and the idea is that it would serve as
26:26 - sort of an entry point as well for
26:28 - people in the app store to find us
26:29 - and start learning swift ui and then
26:32 - potentially maybe
26:34 - turn into a cwc plus member if they want
26:37 - to continue learning
26:38 - through the app or for existing cwc plus
26:41 - members to learn on the go
26:43 - to be able to download the lessons and
26:45 - such so
26:46 - the way that we're approaching this is
26:50 - let me just go back here
26:54 - uh we're we're doing this through
26:57 - mapping out
26:58 - um user journeys so there's this tool
27:02 - called
27:03 - lucid lucidchart or maybe lucid app or
27:07 - something like that and this is just a
27:08 - new tool that we found
27:10 - for we wanted something free and we
27:12 - wanted to be able to map out
27:15 - flows and if you guys know of a
27:17 - different tool that you use i'm sure
27:19 - i'm sure everyone has a tool for
27:21 - something like this
27:22 - let me know what you prefer in the chat
27:24 - for for this time we're just using lucid
27:27 - i don't really have a different tool
27:30 - but we mapped out the different journeys
27:33 - and this is going to
27:34 - basically tell us what to tackle first
27:37 - and
27:38 - uh what sort of different flows exist
27:40 - within this app
27:42 - and this um you know before even diving
27:45 - into
27:45 - technical requirements and app
27:48 - requirements and things like that
27:50 - you put yourself in the perspective of
27:52 - someone who
27:53 - is going to use your app what do you
27:54 - want them to be able to do
27:57 - through your app so here it starts with
28:01 - downloading and opening the app
28:03 - we want to prompt the user if they want
28:05 - to create a code with chris account
28:08 - and we're going to just assume the
28:10 - easiest flow now so they're going to say
28:12 - no
28:12 - but they should still be able to explore
28:14 - the app
28:16 - and view some of the free content that
28:18 - we have like the 14 day beginner
28:20 - challenge
28:22 - so they'll be able to even take that and
28:24 - watch the lessons and
28:25 - take those those courses
28:30 - and then for saving those lessons for
28:33 - offline access
28:34 - we are reserving that for people who
28:36 - have created
28:37 - an account so not necessarily a paid
28:40 - account even
28:40 - creating a free account but you must be
28:43 - logged in to be
28:44 - able to download lessons for offline
28:48 - so if they try to do that then we are
28:50 - going to prompt them for account
28:52 - creation
28:52 - if they don't do that then they just you
28:54 - know they complete the course
28:55 - and then we we say hey if you want to
28:58 - continue
28:59 - learning here we have this awesome
29:02 - foundations course that you can take
29:04 - uh and then we're gonna do an in-app
29:06 - purchase for them
29:07 - to sign up so that's that's one flow
29:11 - right the other flow is like they create
29:13 - an account
29:14 - they say yes and then they they just
29:18 - visit the returning user experience so
29:21 - we have another user flow
29:22 - for returning users
29:31 - and for this one it's very similar but
29:34 - as a returning user
29:36 - you already have an account so you're
29:38 - gonna log in
29:39 - and we have a couple of states here or
29:42 - error states
29:44 - and it depends if they are a cwc plus
29:47 - member then they get access to the
29:49 - entire course catalog and they can
29:52 - engage with all the courses and they can
29:55 - download lessons for offline access if
29:58 - they're not a cwc plus member they can
30:00 - still
30:00 - use all of our free content
30:04 - and also because they have logged in and
30:06 - they have an account they can
30:07 - save and watch videos locally even
30:10 - offline
30:11 - so these are the flows that are planned
30:15 - for now and obviously
30:16 - we can take this even further and we can
30:18 - add different features to it maybe
30:20 - gamification features or
30:22 - featuring news and announcements and
30:25 - things like that
30:27 - for now though this is what we've
30:29 - charted out because it sort of hits
30:31 - the main purpose for the app which is a
30:34 - to allow existing cwc plus members to
30:38 - have an app experience and download
30:40 - videos for offline access and then b
30:42 - to capture new a new audience
30:46 - through the app store who
30:50 - potentially you know could start
30:52 - learning ios
30:53 - with us um and the nice thing about
30:56 - charting out these user journeys is that
30:58 - now it makes it really easy for you to
31:00 - plan out what you want to do
31:02 - so for example when we are working on
31:05 - iterations here um because
31:08 - the the reason why we're planning it out
31:10 - this way with the different sprints like
31:12 - this is because
31:14 - um jesse who is actually an
31:17 - intern here from the university that i
31:19 - used to go to we went through the same
31:22 - internship program when i did computer
31:25 - science at that university we had the
31:27 - same program
31:28 - it's just really cool you alternate so
31:31 - four months you do school
31:32 - and then four months you get to um apply
31:35 - to different jobs and
31:36 - and those companies come and they hire
31:38 - these
31:39 - uh interns so it alternates and you get
31:42 - to try out a whole bunch of different
31:43 - companies i think about four or five
31:45 - different companies before you even
31:46 - graduate
31:47 - and what usually happens is on your last
31:50 - work term
31:50 - so in your last internship um
31:55 - those companies might hire you
31:58 - actually right from graduation
32:01 - so if you you know you have a strong
32:03 - performance they'll
32:04 - make you an offer and so you you might
32:06 - have a job secured
32:08 - before you even graduate so anyways um
32:12 - we are we hired jesse to come on board
32:15 - and he's been working here since june
32:17 - 1st and he's basically ramped up on
32:19 - swift ui i mean he had a
32:21 - programming background he's in computer
32:23 - science as well
32:24 - and that probably made it a little
32:25 - easier for him to
32:27 - to get up to speed so he's going to be
32:29 - working on this app he's going to be the
32:31 - main
32:32 - um the main driver of this
32:36 - i told him go learn some scrum
32:40 - you know how to manage sprints and
32:42 - scrums and things like that and uh
32:44 - help push this forward
32:48 - so i will so i'll be the one
32:51 - that will probably also work on this but
32:54 - you know i want to focus on
32:56 - cwc plus i want to focus on creating
32:57 - course content with you guys
32:59 - streaming with you guys hanging out with
33:01 - you guys and
33:03 - on some of those streams i actually
33:04 - might be working on this app as a
33:06 - as a developer so i think it's also a
33:08 - really cool experience i'm trying to
33:10 - give him
33:10 - as much responsibility as he can handle
33:13 - without
33:14 - overburdening him because i think
33:15 - that'll make a really cool work
33:17 - experience or a work term
33:22 - uh june are you from waterloo as well
33:27 - waterloo university that was the one
33:29 - that i i
33:30 - graduated from uh how do you
33:34 - so june asks how do you learn new ios
33:36 - technologies
33:38 - uh don't worry you're not asking a lot
33:39 - of questions i love it this is the sort
33:41 - of interaction that i really love with
33:42 - the
33:43 - streams that we've been doing um
33:47 - so how do i learn the other
33:50 - what was it in the last stream that i
33:52 - did
33:53 - for thursday i think that was a group
33:57 - study stream
33:58 - where i was just um learning something
34:01 - and i was working on something
34:02 - while you guys chat and i participated
34:05 - in the chat as well
34:06 - but how i learned was i downloaded
34:10 - i just do it the same way you guys do so
34:13 - it usually starts with a google search
34:15 - so
34:15 - that learning that i did on thursday was
34:17 - actually for this app
34:18 - i wanted to figure out how do you
34:20 - download an hls stream
34:23 - for offline viewing so you know that
34:26 - that is what i searched offline hls
34:30 - download or something like that right
34:35 - and i looked at a bunch of resources and
34:38 - apple actually had
34:39 - a they had a sample
34:42 - the problem was that it was done
34:45 - in ui kit and so on thursday
34:49 - when you guys saw me and i had the mic
34:51 - off i was
34:54 - transferring this demo taking trying to
34:56 - learn what exactly they were doing and
34:58 - taking bits out of this code
35:00 - and porting it over to my own swift ui
35:03 - version of the project and i didn't take
35:06 - everything i just took sort of bits and
35:08 - pieces that i needed
35:09 - but you know you can't just randomly
35:11 - take code out of one project
35:13 - without knowing what code you're taking
35:15 - so i had to understand what they were
35:17 - doing
35:18 - right and i tried to replicate that in
35:20 - my own project
35:23 - so yeah that's that's learning new
35:25 - technologies
35:28 - if there is no tutorial there's usually
35:31 - documentation for it
35:33 - so if i wanted to learn something like
35:36 - you know ar kit
35:37 - and i haven't played around with this
35:39 - before but there's a ton of
35:41 - documentation
35:42 - for it and you just gotta get your hands
35:44 - dirty you just have to
35:47 - try things out and
35:50 - hit some roadblocks overcome them and
35:53 - that's how the learning process happens
35:55 - actually funny story when i first
35:56 - graduated in my job
35:59 - first job one of the very first tasks i
36:01 - was assigned to
36:02 - was to figure out microsoft
36:06 - silverlight does anyone in the chat
36:08 - remember this
36:10 - hey pagasi nice to see you uh this thing
36:14 - was basically a flash competitor
36:17 - microsoft's
36:18 - flash competitor so when i started
36:21 - working
36:22 - my first job placement this was brand
36:24 - new and microsoft wanted to
36:27 - really push this so they were paying
36:29 - companies to build demos
36:31 - to showcase silverlight and to use it
36:33 - and to build cool things with
36:34 - silverlight so
36:35 - you know my my company got funding for
36:38 - this
36:38 - um but i was tasked to figure this out
36:41 - learn how to use it and there wasn't
36:42 - a lot of literature or documentation
36:46 - about this and i remember just staying
36:50 - late
36:50 - a lot of staying late a lot banging my
36:54 - head on a lot of things
36:57 - obviously i had a couple of contacts at
36:59 - microsoft because
37:01 - not my own contacts but you know through
37:03 - the company i was working at
37:05 - to talk about some of this stuff and to
37:08 - ask
37:08 - questions but you know this was
37:11 - obviously new to them as well and
37:15 - so yeah it's just a lot of trial and
37:17 - error a lot of bang your head against
37:19 - the wall blend yeah
37:22 - mark yeah blend with their uh design
37:26 - slash developer bridge tool
37:29 - um anyways you know it's crazy to me
37:34 - thinking about that and how technology
37:36 - changes
37:38 - i when i started code with chris i have
37:40 - expected this to last
37:42 - you know maybe two years or three years
37:44 - because ios would eventually fall out of
37:47 - flavor or fall out of favor and there
37:50 - would be new platforms coming up to take
37:52 - its place
37:53 - because so far in my university journey
37:56 - to
37:57 - you know the first maybe three or four
37:59 - years of my career
38:01 - i was just constantly learning different
38:04 - things learning new platforms
38:06 - um i i dabbled in flash
38:09 - i mean obviously there are ones that
38:11 - stood the test of time like java
38:14 - um you know a lot of web web
38:16 - technologies like javascript
38:20 - so that was all good but i learned a lot
38:22 - of flash stuff
38:23 - adobe flex all of the um
38:27 - the microsoft platforms sort of come and
38:29 - came and went
38:30 - there was a microsoft surface that it
38:32 - was really cool i got to work on this
38:35 - it was like a big table no not this
38:37 - thing a
38:38 - table top i don't know if any of you
38:41 - guys remember this
38:42 - actually this coffee table thing
38:47 - and that was use it used to be called
38:50 - microsoft surface now they used the word
38:52 - surface for
38:54 - uh their laptops or their tablets see it
38:57 - was this thing
38:58 - so i got to work on this thing it looks
39:01 - really cool
39:02 - you know the idea of having like a table
39:04 - top and to be able to put things on it
39:06 - and have the tabletop
39:08 - recognize what it was but back then how
39:10 - it actually worked
39:11 - was there were like four cameras under
39:13 - the table that would
39:14 - um i guess detect i i don't really know
39:17 - how it works but
39:19 - it would detect um shadows i don't know
39:22 - i'm speaking out of
39:24 - out of line here already but i got to
39:27 - work on this and as
39:28 - a new grad this was sort of cool because
39:30 - it was brand new not many people had
39:31 - seen it before
39:33 - and i got sent to uh different places in
39:35 - the u.s
39:36 - to work on client sites to
39:40 - build um apps for this so you can see
39:42 - they imagined a lot of different
39:43 - scenarios they imagined this to be in
39:45 - bars
39:47 - where you could put your drink on it and
39:48 - it would like tell you things
39:50 - you could browse menus right here
39:54 - um on the table anyways
39:57 - this is a tangent just reminiscing about
40:00 - the past
40:03 - all right where were we here
40:06 - yes we were talking about the sprints
40:10 - we're talking about
40:12 - uh how we're going to approach building
40:13 - this yes so
40:15 - our first user journey that we're going
40:18 - to do
40:19 - is the easiest one the most simple one
40:22 - it's going to be download and open the
40:26 - app
40:27 - the user is going to say no to
40:29 - registration they're going to be able to
40:31 - interact as a guest and check out all of
40:34 - the free content
40:35 - and view some videos so that is like the
40:39 - most basic flow
40:40 - and we're going to tackle this by user
40:43 - journey
40:44 - so this makes it uh really easy to
40:48 - segment what you're going to do and
40:51 - let's say that
40:52 - things take longer than expected and
40:56 - we get to like our last sprints because
40:58 - jesse has to go back to school
41:00 - and we get back to the last sprint and
41:02 - we've only
41:03 - gotten you know two out of the five user
41:06 - journeys that we had mapped out
41:07 - well that's still a functional app right
41:10 - rather than spending 11 sprints building
41:13 - like the foundation and then at the end
41:15 - of the day you still don't have
41:17 - something that you can publish and
41:19 - people can use
41:20 - so i think this is a really good way to
41:23 - approach it
41:24 - so we're taking this first basic user
41:26 - journey like this is what we want
41:28 - the person to be able to do and we are
41:30 - breaking it out into the tasks
41:32 - that we need to we need to do in order
41:36 - to make that happen
41:38 - and then we are going to plan it out via
41:41 - the
41:42 - across the different sprints so you can
41:45 - see there are a whole bunch of
41:46 - discovery that we had to do for example
41:51 - the courses and the lessons are hosted
41:54 - on a platform called
41:55 - thinkific that's what we use
41:58 - to host all of our content so they had
42:00 - an api
42:01 - and we needed to check that out um
42:05 - the code with chris website is on
42:07 - wordpress
42:08 - so all of the user accounts information
42:12 - uh you know to authenticate users that's
42:15 - on wordpress so that's
42:16 - a completely different platform and
42:20 - we needed to figure out okay across
42:23 - those two different platforms what are
42:25 - we going to do
42:26 - how are we going to connect it to this
42:28 - app
42:29 - uh things like that so anyways that's
42:32 - just a little behind the scenes that
42:33 - sort of
42:34 - this is the next three months i would
42:36 - say maybe two and a half months
42:39 - so uh maybe i'll give you guys an update
42:41 - and you'll probably see me working
42:43 - on some of these tasks on the stream as
42:45 - well
42:47 - so i want to give you guys a little
42:49 - update on the
42:51 - instagram analytics app so if you
42:54 - remember from back then this was with
42:58 - our um previous intern bowen
43:01 - and he's actually coming back to help us
43:04 - part-time
43:04 - because he's he's in school right so
43:06 - he's helping us part-time
43:08 - on this new app with jesse so it's going
43:10 - to be really cool to have multiple
43:12 - people working on it and obviously we
43:13 - have our designer jc who's
43:15 - also there but bowen worked on the
43:19 - instagram analytics app to analyze
43:22 - other people's profiles and give you
43:25 - insights on what other people are doing
43:27 - so that was the app that we built
43:29 - during his internship here and
43:33 - we we did this three month app case
43:36 - study
43:36 - where we
43:40 - i made bowen uh do daily updates
43:43 - on what he was working on and so we have
43:46 - all of these
43:47 - weeks here and i also gave behind the
43:50 - scenes footage because i was pretty in
43:52 - touch with
43:53 - what he was doing so he would write his
43:55 - daily update and
43:56 - i would sort of shoot a video and um
44:00 - and show you guys behind the scenes how
44:03 - things were looking like
44:06 - so that video let me show you the
44:09 - sprints here
44:10 - so you can see same sort of thing but
44:12 - this is for the instagram
44:14 - analytics app and he completed all of
44:17 - these sprints so that's really cool
44:19 - and again bowen came into our company
44:22 - he didn't know he didn't even know swift
44:25 - he didn't even know swift ui so like
44:27 - that really proves to you
44:28 - how quickly you can learn these things
44:30 - right it's
44:32 - but obviously um he probably had an
44:35 - advantage as well because he
44:37 - he was studying computer science and he
44:38 - knew other languages so that definitely
44:41 - gave him a leg
44:42 - up so anyways i want to give you guys an
44:44 - update on that because
44:46 - we had never built an app before to try
44:49 - to
44:50 - get users and try to gain traction so we
44:52 - really didn't know what we were doing
44:54 - and we had some assumptions so we wrote
44:57 - them down
44:58 - uh as to what we thought the process
45:02 - would look like into this product
45:04 - framework and this is
45:06 - something that i imagine to be a work in
45:08 - progress that we would
45:10 - continually refine uh these steps
45:13 - so our current framework was for the
45:16 - instagram
45:17 - app was to
45:20 - have an idea and then validate that with
45:24 - the people uh the market to see if it's
45:26 - something that people would want
45:27 - prototype
45:28 - it and i guess are we missing a build
45:31 - part
45:32 - this prototype oh yes because we wanted
45:35 - to prototype it and i guess what we
45:36 - release with the instagram app
45:38 - is a prototype because we really it's a
45:41 - subset of all the features we have
45:43 - imagined from it uh to get initial users
45:46 - iterate next steps and all that
45:48 - so this that validate actually took
45:52 - it takes a lot longer than we had
45:54 - thought and so during bowen's time here
45:58 - we didn't have enough time to go through
46:00 - this properly
46:02 - and so we decided that um
46:05 - we were gonna go forward anyways and i
46:07 - think that was that was sort of bad but
46:09 - at the same time
46:10 - um our hands were kind of tied so
46:14 - it's almost like right now what we've
46:16 - done with the app is like we've built it
46:17 - we've released our prototype
46:19 - um but now we need to collect feedback
46:22 - and turn it into
46:23 - mold it into something that people would
46:25 - actually want whereas i think
46:28 - you know this step should come first
46:30 - with the cwc app
46:32 - this is not so much an issue because i
46:34 - know
46:35 - you guys and those of you who are in the
46:38 - cwc
46:39 - plus program would immediately find
46:41 - value from this so
46:43 - this is not so much of an issue here but
46:46 - the way that we're approaching
46:48 - how to build this is already different
46:50 - just
46:51 - based on doing user journeys like this
46:53 - this
46:54 - we didn't do any of this with the
46:55 - instagram analytics app that we built
46:57 - before
46:58 - so anyways let me jump into the app
47:02 - store to show you guys
47:04 - uh jeff what is the cwc app it's an app
47:06 - that we are
47:07 - working on to basically for existing
47:11 - members to have
47:12 - an app experience with cwc plus so they
47:14 - can download all of the lessons for
47:16 - offline viewing
47:18 - as well as for new people to find us
47:21 - through the app store and get introduced
47:23 - to our brand
47:31 - all right thank you rose for joining
47:35 - hi pratham
47:41 - okay cool let me where's that that
47:43 - window i had yeah
47:46 - oh looks like i gotta log in again give
47:48 - me a second
47:58 - so i really didn't know what to expect
48:01 - with this
48:01 - because we had launched it and
48:05 - we had not planned to market this very
48:08 - heavily
48:09 - because i didn't feel like this was the
48:12 - end state yet
48:13 - and i feel like i needed to get enough
48:17 - feedback to iterate on it to turn it
48:19 - into something that
48:20 - people wanted to use before like heavily
48:23 - trying to promote it
48:24 - but it's sort of like a chicken and egg
48:26 - scenario because if you don't have
48:27 - people using it how are you going to get
48:28 - the feedback to improve it
48:31 - so i think that was the wrong move that
48:34 - was the lesson learned i think you do
48:35 - have to get it out there
48:37 - um and get people using it so you can
48:39 - collect feedback but make sure you have
48:41 - a feedback mechanism in place
48:45 - right otherwise people are just using it
48:47 - you can't collect the feedback
48:48 - so without any marketing at all uh
48:52 - i guess publishing our updates on
48:54 - youtube was a form of marketing too
48:57 - but i mean we haven't done any paid
48:59 - advertising we haven't like tried to
49:00 - publish
49:01 - articles or something so this is just
49:03 - organic downloads from the app store
49:05 - just
49:06 - people searching for maybe instagram
49:08 - analytics and finding
49:10 - the app you can see that maybe on
49:12 - average it's
49:14 - a profile scorecards is is the name of
49:17 - the
49:18 - instagram analytics app so you can see
49:20 - that there's a there's a bunch
49:22 - maybe four to five a day i would say
49:24 - this is organic
49:26 - um
49:29 - yeah there's nothing to buy in the app
49:32 - right now
49:32 - there's no monetization because that
49:35 - sort of wasn't the focus right now
49:37 - uh there's no banner ads or anything
49:39 - like so no money is being made from this
49:42 - um yeah but eventually i wanted to
49:45 - introduce some sort of monetization to
49:47 - it so i wanted
49:48 - to have like an option to purchase to
49:50 - get some premium features
49:52 - and that sort of thing
49:57 - this is the first time hearing about the
49:59 - app yeah so this
50:01 - instagram analytics app was actually the
50:04 - the three month case study
50:05 - in our cwc uh plus course that we did
50:10 - this this guy right here so
50:13 - our current plan with how we're going to
50:17 - you know what we're going to do with
50:18 - this app um is after wwdc which is now
50:23 - uh we were then going to take a look at
50:26 - the roadmap for this but i think the
50:28 - next step for this is like i actually
50:30 - have to get into the community
50:31 - of people who are focused on their
50:34 - instagram account and want to build it
50:37 - and get their feedback get some feedback
50:41 - because just organically people
50:43 - downloading this i'm not getting enough
50:45 - people
50:45 - using it to really get a sense of
50:48 - whether or not this is helpful for
50:49 - people
50:51 - right we can look at um
50:57 - yeah we can look at how how many people
50:59 - actually return
51:00 - retention that's the word i'm looking
51:02 - for retention and how many people come
51:03 - back to use the app
51:05 - um but i have that somewhere else
51:08 - in another in another platform for
51:10 - analytics so maybe i'll show you guys
51:12 - that next time
51:13 - but i think the next step for me is like
51:16 - i need to get some feedback
51:20 - on this app actually find out if it's
51:22 - useful and if it's not so useful find
51:24 - out what's missing
51:26 - um and then just iterate on that and
51:29 - that's how
51:29 - actually even code with chris has gotten
51:32 - to this point
51:32 - we've tried so many things that really
51:35 - hasn't worked
51:36 - um until we got to this point where you
51:40 - know
51:40 - i think we're reaching a lot more people
51:42 - than before and
51:44 - um yeah we've tried so many different
51:48 - tools so many different workflows so
51:49 - many
51:50 - different things it's just persistence
51:53 - and and iteration i feel like those
51:56 - those are some of the most important
51:59 - skills
52:03 - pagassi we are making a cwc app
52:07 - yeah we are making a cwc app for members
52:11 - of the program to download videos
52:14 - to view offline and also for people to
52:17 - find us through the app store so this is
52:19 - currently an app that's going on um
52:22 - don't know how or if i am going to
52:26 - share this as a case study because i
52:29 - haven't
52:30 - really organized it that way uh but i'll
52:32 - probably
52:33 - share updates with you guys on the
52:34 - stream and i'll be working on tasks on
52:36 - this as well
52:40 - if anything i might as we continue
52:44 - working on the
52:45 - instagram analytics app i'll continue to
52:47 - update
52:49 - the case study here and provide updates
52:51 - there because we're not giving up on
52:52 - this
52:53 - instagram analytics app um i think we've
52:56 - the idea is still unproven right until
52:59 - we actually
53:00 - prove that this is not something that
53:02 - people want and even then
53:03 - if we can't pivot into a direction
53:07 - that people you know that's something
53:09 - that they want
53:11 - we won't be giving up on this app so
53:14 - i really want to crack that code on like
53:16 - how how to make money on the app store
53:18 - because i feel like
53:20 - a lot of people have that aspiration
53:23 - and i can't give you a straight answer
53:25 - on how to do that as well
53:28 - and unless you you know obviously you
53:30 - can hit the jackpot and you can come up
53:32 - with something that
53:33 - has a perfect um fit to what people are
53:37 - looking for
53:38 - and you sort of capitalize on that trend
53:40 - and it just takes off
53:41 - as a rocket ship but i think that's more
53:42 - of the anomaly i think
53:44 - now um more than ever you're building
53:47 - something
53:48 - and you you're treating the app like a
53:50 - business you're not just
53:51 - building an app and then building
53:52 - another one building another one and
53:54 - expect to find success
53:56 - i think you have to iterate on the app
53:58 - and slowly
53:59 - morph it and transform it into its
54:02 - ultimate form where it
54:04 - you know it is pulling in a ton of
54:05 - revenue for you and then at that point
54:07 - you add the paid advertising and scale
54:10 - it up even more anyways those are just
54:12 - my
54:13 - my thoughts obviously unvalidated
54:16 - but that's what i find so interesting
54:18 - about doing this is because i want to
54:20 - i want to figure out this puzzle
54:41 - jeff you had an idea for building a
54:42 - fitness yoga and health app yeah i think
54:44 - the health
54:45 - the health space is really really good
54:48 - to be in because
54:50 - that will never go away people will
54:52 - always be looking for
54:54 - ways to be healthier right to keep fit
54:57 - that's sort of like a basic
54:59 - human need whereas something like this
55:02 - right
55:02 - instagram might go um the way that i was
55:05 - thinking about this
55:06 - instagram analytics before was that uh
55:09 - i was targeting uh maybe people who
55:13 - would be willing to invest in a tool
55:15 - like this to increase their
55:19 - social presence of people who are trying
55:22 - to
55:22 - turn this their instagram profile like
55:24 - into a business so
55:26 - i thought that uh monetizing
55:30 - those types of users um they'd be more
55:32 - willing to spend money because
55:34 - they're spending money to make money
55:36 - essentially but i think the health space
55:38 - definitely
55:39 - is is a great place to be in
55:46 - health and food yeah diet oh man
55:51 - does do you guys work out regularly like
55:53 - keep fit do you guys do
55:54 - uh yoga or stretching you know actually
55:57 - one thing i've always wanted to talk
55:59 - about on this channel
56:00 - which i haven't yet is how
56:04 - we are always on our computers
56:07 - i don't know how how often you guys are
56:09 - on your computers but
56:11 - over time you develop this hunched
56:13 - posture right like your arms are like
56:14 - this
56:15 - your shoulders roll forward and if
56:17 - you're not someone who
56:18 - actively you know who is not active then
56:21 - you're constantly sitting
56:22 - you're constantly hunched forward your
56:24 - neck goes forward
56:25 - and you just get into a really bad
56:27 - posture and i've been trying to correct
56:29 - that posture
56:31 - uh for probably a year now on and off
56:35 - um there are yeah show you guys
56:50 - so you guys might have seen this being
56:53 - advertised
56:54 - on youtube ads or whatever it's it's
56:57 - basically like a back
56:58 - brace and you're supposed to wear it
57:02 - like this
57:03 - and it's supposed to pull your shoulders
57:06 - back
57:07 - and people are trying to sell this thing
57:09 - for like thirty dollars or forty dollars
57:11 - but just go on aliexpress.com and i
57:13 - bought it for five dollars and i wanted
57:14 - to see what it's like
57:15 - so it basically pulls my shoulders back
57:18 - and keeps me in this posture
57:19 - but after using this for a while what i
57:21 - realized is that
57:24 - having this is not going to change your
57:25 - posture it it sort of reminds you
57:28 - because it keeps you from slouching
57:29 - forward but ultimately what you have to
57:31 - do
57:32 - is you have to strengthen the muscles
57:34 - that are weak
57:36 - in your back because of constant hunch
57:39 - and neck forward posture um
57:42 - so you you need to strengthen the
57:44 - muscles to
57:45 - um counterbalance because your body
57:48 - essentially is out of balance now
57:50 - some muscles are stronger and tighter
57:52 - than others
57:53 - and then also neck posture one next
57:55 - stretch that i found
57:57 - really helpful with forward forward neck
57:59 - posture is chin tuck so you go like this
58:02 - so you look like you have a double chin
58:05 - and you go forward and back and forward
58:08 - and back not really fast but
58:09 - do it in a controlled manner and you
58:12 - will hear
58:12 - like some some cracking maybe that's the
58:16 - wrong word because it sounds really
58:17 - extreme
58:17 - but you'll basically release you'll
58:20 - release your neck and it'll feel really
58:21 - good
58:22 - so anyways if you guys are interested in
58:24 - that sort of stuff
58:26 - um let me know i might talk more about
58:28 - it
58:29 - and then there's a you know your hip
58:31 - flexors get tight when you sit a lot
58:33 - so i think maybe because i'm getting
58:36 - older now
58:37 - i'm definitely concerned more about
58:39 - posture
58:40 - and how you know what we're doing to our
58:43 - bodies as we're sitting
58:44 - in this chair and staring at a screen
58:47 - all day
58:54 - yeah issa trying to work out regularly
58:56 - especially since covid
58:57 - not just for physical health but for
58:59 - deaf folks who stare at screens a lot
59:01 - yeah for mental health as well that's
59:03 - good that's good
59:09 - jeff you have online classes for eight
59:10 - hours it's really annoying
59:12 - yeah even even my kids right now because
59:14 - they're doing online schooling so
59:15 - they're staring at a screen all day and
59:17 - i just don't know
59:19 - sort of what sort of impact that has on
59:21 - them because
59:22 - i feel like children should be outside
59:26 - they should be
59:26 - interacting live with with other kids
59:30 - but it is what it is right now
59:47 - actually right now i am fasting
59:50 - and i know it's it's sort of like a
59:51 - trendy thing right now
59:53 - but uh i've been doing it for the last
59:58 - 112 days in a row so i use this app and
60:02 - i
60:02 - actually learned about this app from
60:06 - from revenue cat in their podcast it's
60:08 - called xero
60:10 - and basically i am almost done my
60:14 - fast 30 minutes until i can eat
60:17 - so it's basically uh for me i'm doing an
60:20 - eight hour eating window
60:23 - so i eat from noon to 8 pm
60:27 - and then after that um i don't eat until
60:30 - the following day at noon
60:32 - and so i've been doing this for
60:35 - [Music]
60:38 - the screen will load i can show you guys
60:41 - yeah
60:42 - see a hundred and twelve consecutive
60:46 - days
60:46 - so this is pretty cool um
60:50 - and how has it been going well when i
60:52 - combined
60:53 - fasting with uh eating right
60:57 - and like you obviously can't stuff your
60:59 - face with junk
61:00 - during the eight hours but it was
61:02 - actually
61:03 - working to lose uh lose weight if that
61:06 - is your primary concern for me
61:08 - losing weight was kind of just a side
61:10 - benefit
61:12 - but i wanted to see if it would give me
61:14 - more energy
61:16 - right and it would basically just
61:20 - help me in terms of general health
61:23 - and now i've done it for this long it
61:25 - doesn't even feel like i'm doing
61:27 - anything
61:27 - i like i don't feel hungry during the
61:30 - times i don't have to eat
61:31 - uh and well actually one of the big
61:34 - things that it helped
61:35 - curb was eating at night um
61:40 - we had a bad habit ellen and i to sit on
61:43 - the couch at night
61:44 - watch netflix open a bag of popcorn or
61:46 - whatever
61:47 - whatever snack it may be and you know we
61:50 - would snack
61:51 - we would snack and i don't think that's
61:53 - bad within reason
61:54 - but um we were not really within reason
61:58 - i feel and so ever since we started
62:01 - doing this fasting
62:02 - app and i think part of the success that
62:05 - the reason for the success we've had
62:07 - with
62:07 - it for adhering to it is because we're
62:09 - both doing it we're both on board
62:11 - imagine i'm fasting at night and she's
62:13 - you know munching on chips and i don't
62:15 - think that would work
62:16 - so you know we've both been fasting
62:19 - we've been doing this thing
62:20 - uh it's been working out really well
62:22 - basically cold turkey
62:24 - cut all of the snacking at night
62:28 - so i don't know there's something for
62:30 - you you to try if
62:31 - you're trying to curb a bad habit in
62:33 - terms of eating
62:41 - pegasi that the circular progress bars
62:44 - they look good but i can't find
62:45 - good videos for basic progress bar work
62:47 - anywhere beyond super basic because
62:49 - everyone wants to talk about the circle
62:53 - um yeah there are actually a ton of
62:55 - tutorials on there but why
62:57 - why aren't they working out for you like
63:00 - what's wrong with the existing tutorials
63:03 - because one of the app challenges which
63:06 - jesse has done
63:07 - is a hydration app and it uses a um
63:12 - it uses a circular progress bar
63:15 - and when i looked at the code it was
63:16 - actually really easy to do
63:18 - so maybe you can let me know why the
63:21 - existing tutorials out there
63:23 - don't really fit what you're looking for
63:30 - sergio uh you're doing keto keto is i
63:32 - think it's even harder to do i tried
63:34 - that for
63:36 - uh this was years ago when i tried keto
63:38 - uh it was really tough
63:40 - because you can't have any sugar not
63:42 - even from fruits and stuff
63:44 - if i remember correctly and i i was like
63:47 - making my own chocolate
63:49 - because i guess when you go on keto you
63:53 - try to find replacements for that sugar
63:55 - that you've been missing right
63:56 - and so guys hold on
64:25 - sorry about that um what platform do you
64:29 - use to track your timeline such as days
64:31 - for habits like fasting uh i use this
64:34 - app called xero it's free
64:35 - so i mean you can pay for it but i'm not
64:38 - paying for it
64:39 - it you can use all of this for free
64:41 - it'll
64:42 - tell you it you know what you know what
64:45 - it is like you don't really need an
64:47 - app for this but i find that
64:50 - you know just having some button to
64:52 - press to say like
64:54 - okay now you're going to fasting and
64:55 - then another button to press that you're
64:57 - done you're fasting it's sort of like a
64:58 - mental switch for you
65:00 - um and then also it tracks your
65:03 - statistics
65:04 - so it gives you like encouragement like
65:06 - oh you've done
65:08 - how many days in a row and
65:11 - uh it really helps motivate you because
65:14 - you don't want to break the streak so
65:15 - that's all it does and you can use all
65:16 - this for free
65:17 - this is the xero app
65:20 - sergio peanut butter peanut butter
65:22 - peanut butter keto friendly
65:25 - or are you talking about specifically
65:27 - keto friendly peanut butters
65:29 - i don't remember was i eating a lot of
65:31 - peanut butter
65:32 - so many years ago i don't remember but
65:34 - actually it worked
65:35 - so i was on keto for maybe um a month i
65:38 - think
65:39 - um and actually worked but it's hard um
65:42 - if you have a family because you have to
65:44 - prepare different foods
65:45 - unless you put your kids on keto as well
65:55 - pagassi you wanted circle bars but put
65:57 - text in the center
66:00 - but basic progress bars require text
66:02 - outside of the bar
66:04 - i want text zed stacked on the basic bar
66:08 - but in swift ui
66:10 - okay so maybe maybe i'll
66:14 - show you what what jesse did it wasn't
66:17 - he didn't use the progress bar control
66:20 - if if that's what you're talking about
66:23 - um it was literally like drawing circles
66:29 - you said you'd eat your phone after day
66:31 - two
66:38 - yeah as long as the peanut butter
66:39 - doesn't have sugar and daily carb is
66:41 - less than 20 grams it sounds like you're
66:43 - well into keto
66:44 - how long have you been doing it for
66:58 - all right guys i have to go soon um
67:01 - almost lunch time with the family
67:04 - but the next time i'll stream is
67:07 - probably on
67:08 - thursday so check out the stream
67:12 - schedule
67:24 - yeah so i i think it might just be a
67:27 - study session
67:28 - i don't really have anything planned
67:29 - right now i'm sort of planning these on
67:30 - the fly
67:31 - as i'm going but it's great to chat with
67:34 - you guys regardless
67:36 - um just to hang out we'll probably do
67:38 - some studying and some coding
67:41 - it's hard for me to actually code on
67:44 - stream
67:44 - in 1080p right now so if i do do coding
67:47 - it might be
67:48 - 7 20 which kind of kind of sucks
67:51 - yeah i gotta hold up for one more week
67:54 - until the mac mini comes and then we'll
67:56 - stream in 1080p
68:01 - yeah sergio it's hard to it's hard to do
68:02 - keto diet with the
68:04 - with your family and friends if you're
68:06 - preparing your own food
68:08 - then i guess that's not really a problem
68:12 - pegasi will uh i'll share the code
68:16 - that he used in the code crew forum so
68:18 - maybe i'll help you
68:20 - maybe that's what you're looking for
68:26 - no he didn't even use a bezier path or
68:28 - bezier path
68:29 - it was even more simple than that
68:33 - um it was literally
68:38 - a circle with the with just the stroke
68:42 - with a trim to cut out the segment
68:46 - that's missing on the progress and then
68:48 - a rotate
68:50 - anyways i'll show you that code it might
68:51 - be what you're looking for alessandro oh
68:54 - no worries
68:54 - i'm going to be streaming again on
68:56 - thursday so hope to see you there
68:59 - uh will there be new courses on the cwc
69:02 - uh we
69:03 - it will but my pro priority right now is
69:05 - to finish the
69:07 - databases app sorry databases course
69:10 - so right now we are on the last module
69:13 - of the databases course
69:15 - where it really is just getting people
69:18 - introduced to core data
69:20 - firestore database and setting up the
69:22 - prerequisites
69:23 - so that we can start using those skills
69:26 - to build
69:26 - other apps the design course actually
69:30 - is also underway and that's going to
69:33 - move faster because
69:34 - we have two people working on it the
69:36 - designer who's going to be doing the
69:38 - design
69:38 - parts and myself who who's going to show
69:41 - you how to integrate
69:42 - those design assets into xcode so i have
69:45 - a feeling that course is gonna go
69:47 - you know double time and then after that
69:50 - we're gonna be
69:51 - building um apps using all the skills
69:53 - you've learned in the foundations course
69:54 - the database course and the design
69:56 - course
69:57 - together and and yeah it'll be cool
69:59 - it'll be cool because then we can build
70:01 - some cooler stuff
70:02 - if you've gone through those three
70:03 - courses and by the way
70:05 - if anyone is thinking about joining cwc
70:07 - plus today
70:08 - is the last day for our wdc sale
70:11 - no pressure though we always have sales
70:14 - so
70:18 - issa thank you so much for for pointing
70:21 - students our way
70:25 - awesome uh thank you so much srianz
70:28 - thank you
70:34 - easy visual studio i'm not sure does
70:37 - anyone
70:38 - have an idea um about using visual
70:41 - studio
70:42 - i don't think so to be honest i did see
70:45 - something
70:46 - like that before i thought i saw visual
70:49 - studio
70:50 - somewhere but i don't know in what
70:51 - context visual studio
70:53 - for swift
70:59 - yeah you might want to check some of
71:01 - this out i haven't looked into it myself
71:06 - you know what like you might be able to
71:08 - compile
71:09 - swift however you won't get
71:12 - like the ide and xcode for using swift
71:15 - ui
71:15 - i don't think
71:19 - ronin welcome to cwc plus thank you so
71:22 - much for your support
71:23 - i hope you enjoy it
71:28 - yeah sergio yeah finding food without
71:30 - sugar sugars and everything
71:33 - isn't everything so hard
71:38 - is he says the database course different
71:40 - from the firebase stuff that you have
71:41 - from before
71:43 - um i guess the
71:47 - it would i would say yes because it is
71:50 - in a swift ui
71:51 - context the database stuff from before
71:54 - was working in a ui kit
71:56 - context so the syntax is different
71:59 - uh where things are are a little
72:01 - different but in terms of
72:03 - uh how the database works
72:08 - um you know if you get the gist of
72:11 - how to do the crud operations with the
72:13 - database that still is the same
72:16 - it's just syntactically is a little
72:18 - different because of swift ui
72:20 - that's all so you don't have you know
72:22 - it's not going to be completely
72:24 - uh brand new for you if you've already
72:28 - done it before
72:33 - all right guys i gotta call it a date
72:35 - but thank you so much for joining
72:37 - and thank you for your support i really
72:38 - enjoyed hanging out with you guys and
72:40 - chatting with you
72:41 - uh hopefully um i have something else
72:43 - planned otherwise
72:44 - on thursday it'll just be a study in
72:46 - code stream and we'll hang out and chat
72:48 - and we'll build our own stuff alright
72:51 - see you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

hello hello can you guys hear me and there's a little bit of a delay hello hello can you guys hear me is the audio good can you see me so today i wanted to take you guys through some of the behind the scenes with code with chris and show you a little bit about how we plan our content and how we create it and how different members of the team come together and get it done and publish the youtube videos that you guys watch in addition to that i wanted to talk a little bit about an app that we're building and show you the process that we're going through and then also if you've been following the channel for a while you'll know that we built an instagram analytics app uh for a three month case study and we i gave a couple of updates on youtube before so i want to give you guys and a look into our app store analytics for that app and to show you how that's doing all right hello so you'll notice that streaming in 1080p now but my computer actually if i open xcode and i run it it's really going to choke and die all right so we have some offending members in the chat hi call of programming how are you doing hi angelo hi nice to see you coding along today cool angelo nice to see you hey tutor hey june ah so do you use an m1 mac so i was just talking about this right now this is actually a pretty old imac and up until now it's suited my needs fine because i have a ton of ram and um it's like a mid 2015 i5 quad core mac with 32 gigs of ram so i've been loving the retina the 5k retina screen and it's been fine but now that i'm starting to stream and i realized that i wasn't streaming in 1080p before it was just 720 and and even the replays right were not in 1080p and i was like that i can't have that i need at least 1080p so i tested out streaming over the weekend in 1080p so my bandwidth is completely fine but my computer actually chokes when um i run xcode so right now the stream is 1080p you guys will be able to switch that on to that level but as soon as i launch xcode and i try to build a project it the cpu tanks and then you get buffering and all that stuff so today because i am just showing you guys sort of behind the scenes and how our company works together to produce content to produce apps and give you some app updates on uh the instagram analytics app showing you some app store uh analytics i want to show you guys what we're planning for the cwc app and how we're going about executing it because this would have been the second app that we built as a company and so we've learned lessons from building the instagram analytics app so we're going to do things a little differently i want to share that with you yeah but oh i forgot the second part june park you asked me if i had an m1 mac um so i am getting one in because of what i just told you i do want to be able to show you guys you know building apps and writing code and you know doing stuff in xcode and still stream in 1080p so i do have a mac coming in and speaking of which i haven't actually ordered it yet i want to get your opinion and i you know i already have in my mind what i want to do um but anyways it's got to be m1 the performance is there i looked at geekbench scores right now i'm using a 27 uh inch imac i love this screen right problem is no n1 chip for this just yet however if we take a look at these ones right here you know shiny and new cool colors um i was gonna get the the green one i wanted i don't know i know my brand is blue but i i think green is really soothing you know like plants botanical green so i was really leaning towards this green one the only thing that really held me back was this 24 inch display uh and the viewable area for this is actually only 21 inches and so the viewable area for my imac right now is 27 inches and i don't know if i can i can do i can go from that level to that level and so i decided that i will probably order a mac mini today i'll probably place the order today and i will probably upgrade the the ram on this guy and also the hard drive because right now uh for the ssd right now this imac has ssd but it's only 250 so i'm constantly running out of space especially you know producing large videos um for for production and post editing so i'll probably upgrade this and probably get 16 gigabytes now the nice thing about the mac mini is that in the future when i need to upgrade this machine again um i don't have to replace the monitor right i can get a nice beautiful big monitor and then i can just swap out the mac mini itself right now with this imac i i love the screen but the specs really um starting to feel lacking especially with the streaming in 1080p so this is probably what i'm going to go with and then buy a monitor and it says that it won't get delivered until that's actually really fast so i'll probably get it pretty soon and then i'll be streaming in 1080p i can compile the next code and there won't be any performance bumps anyways i went on a rant there yeah yeah call of programming we you are going to see the analytics of the app today i'll probably do that a little later on in the stream if you uh can't wait for that if you need to go this replay will always be up serdar yeah the the imac with the m1 chip beautiful machine and display especially orange color yeah why don't you guys tell me in the chat right now what color would you get if you were to get one of these what is your favorite color right here it's crazy how thin these are it's crazy thin david i would ha you have the mac mini would highly recommend it i'm glad i'm glad to hear that rose um 2018 macbook pro i love my macbook pro oh 2019. yeah these machines like i i don't know the the machines that at least i've bought from apple have lasted pretty long they've done pretty well i would say it's a good investment for those people you know where their budget fits and blue blue forever blue or white a lot of blue yeah i think i guess apple did their research because blue is uh their default color here i think most people blue orange oranges is unique i think this will definitely stand out if you get an orange or yellow one or even a red one because you don't normally see those right these would be equivalent to you know driving those super cars with the flashy colors that's what this would be june park you bought the cwc plus course and loving it are the swift ui database courses still in progress yeah ashley asha just updated the road map so if you go to the road map right here i'm working on lessons two and three today so lesson one has been it's not been published but it's ready to be published but we're thinking that after we work on lessons two and three which will probably get published sometime tomorrow if i work on them today then we'll publish all three at once so really pushing to get this done uh matt s if you're getting an m1 macbook for coding definitely need the 16 gigs of ram right um maybe someone in the chat can also chime in tutor you have an m1 macbook air did you upgrade the ram for me i would personally say if you can afford it i would say yes it just extends the life of your machine longer like for this one i've used this machine for you know since i didn't buy it in 2015 i actually bought this mid 2015 imac in about 2017 so it still lasted like four four years for me um with good performance too like it doesn't lag in xcode or anything like that and i would honestly continue using this machine if not for the fact of streaming in 1080p and xcode don't really play nice together with this configuration here splash route yeah you think my imac at this this level wouldn't be able to run mac os monterey you might be right i haven't installed the beta yet but i'm glad i'm making the jump to upgrade and i'm thinking that i won't need to for another at least three four years hopefully yeah that's the thing with apple with you know when you buy a brand new iphone it's blazing fast and over time as you get the updates it just gets slower and slower until the point you want to upgrade but even those they last i've been using my iphone for a good three years i would say yeah uh this one is uh what is what is my iphone hold on let me check all right but i haven't upgraded this in a while it's an oh it's an iphone xs max yeah i think that was the year they came up with these weird naming conventions yeah started with the iphone x and then xs and xs masks but anyways okay let's get started i want to jump into a ton of things to show you guys today so a little preview of the analytics there let me just first show you what i have here so i made the font really big hopefully you guys can see that okay so this is a tool called mondaymonday.com and sometimes it's really confusing to say to people put it on monday because it's also a day but um over the years we've started building our team at first it was just myself and then we had our video editor adrian so he right now edits all the course videos and the youtube videos and in the beginning it was really easy to work together we just actually communicated through twitter dms and we didn't really need a project management sort of tool before and so when we were starting to consider these tools we actually went through a whole bunch of things before landing on this one which suited our needs so i'm not going to walk you through like every single board here but in general things start here in our planning board um and we have a bunch of templates depending on what we're working on so for example in the youtube video template you see that there's a whole bunch like a checklist a whole bunch of things to do so we duplicate one of these and we put it into this group called scoping so here are a bunch of things that we're thinking that would most likely do and here we're talking about um just planning out what we're gonna cover and things like that and in addition just to go back to the road map oh i actually closed it but you know this road map that i showed you guys here there is an updates and also an ideas tab so when you come here and you submit an idea you can also vote on other people's ideas and we we look at this right to drive what we're going to create in terms of content in part in addition to the other things that we want to create so this one responsive design is on the roadmap and i'm working on that one um but yeah that's sort of what happens here so in the produce tab it goes from planning once we scoped it out it goes into this produce board and this is where it sort of flows from top down this is the workflow it goes from here goes down down down into release promote for the newsletter and there are different members of the team that work in in parallel and in different areas for this so usually that video or that topic will come into development and design where we're going to be building or designing right and then it goes into lesson planning so let me drill into one of these and you can assign the person here you can assign a status as you can see i need to do a code review for this monthly app challenge right here and we are also working on surfacing all of the cwc stories so i was um promoting this campaign pretty heavily before so let me just show you what this would look like normally uh we use figma for all of our graphics stuff so we usually have a link to a figma file so this is what this landing page is going to look like and we're featuring basically all of your stories some of you actually might be in the stream right now and just telling us your story so we're gonna surface those beautiful stories on a landing page so that's what this project is about um here you can see in the lesson lesson planning phase um uh we are trying to flesh out these lessons and trying to get them out the door it starts with planning the lesson which is um for me writing an intro writing and conclusion uh which are usually just a couple of lines anyways and then planning in bullet point form what i want to cover in that lesson um and then usually when you click into one of these we'll have a figma file for all of the graphic assets for that lesson and also a google doc for the either the script if there is like a lot of talking i'll usually script it um but then as i'm delivering it and i'm recording it i won't read it word for word because it's really hard to stare at the camera and read so i'll get the gist of it and then i will use my own words that's usually how it goes but for these these ones for example let's see if i can find another one yeah so this one i'm working on today and this is in the production phase so i'm actually recording it or i'm writing it it depends if it's like a blog article that would be writing if it's a video i'll be recording it so just a couple of lessons or sorry a couple of sentences for the intro and the outro and then in the screencast section i'll write some bullet points on what i want to cover and then from production it goes into postproduction where this is where adrian does most of his work where he'll actually edit the video and he will then assign it to me for review so let me show you what what that might look like so we have a shared dropbox and he'll put it in here and then he'll cut me a copy for review so this video is actually coming out soon uh on the channel and it is where you guys gave me advice on well you guys told me what advice you would give to someone who's just starting out learning ios app development so i took a uh i read all of your pieces of advice and i commented on them and just gave my feedback and my opinion on it so that's coming out so for that you know i have reviewed it this morning so i would go set it ready to start and then i would assign it to adrian and i would just tell them we would check those off and so see there's a process as um the business gets larger and we're starting to produce more content uh this this stuff was all new to me to be honest it just started out initially as me right filming something on the computer editing it and then pushing it out onto youtube but now it's become this giant workflow where multiple people work on it so it's really amazing to see and for me personally i you know i didn't take business in school i don't know how to manage it you know manage my team effectively manage a business and this is all a learning process so it's really cool waiting to be released there's a whole bunch of stuff actually that i haven't got to releasing just yet you'll see that our designer has been working on some design course materials as well so we're stepping up our production game i also hope to probably hire another person later this year that would be really cool if we can get some more people producing content um i've also been thinking about how you guys as part of the community like we all have something to teach right um you might think you're a beginner but there i bet you there's someone who is even below you just starting out and wants to know what you know so we can all um create the content and that's only going to strengthen the ios community so i'm thinking about some way to uh really highlight the community and um you know to get the community teaching and sharing i'm not exactly sure how to do that just yet but i think that would be really cool okay so that's basically the two main boards aside from that we have a community board where arthur who is our customer success person uh at code with chris basically handles a lot of the social comments so you you've probably seen him and francis uh work together to answer youtube comments and like instagram comments and all of that stuff sometimes i'll step in and also help out but there's no way i can keep up with all of the messages and we have a rule here that we try to answer every single person so every single like comment dm website message instagram dm youtube comment we try to answer everybody and you know we we might not always succeed but i think we do a pretty good job of it so there's also um yeah also our forum as well which we try to answer everyone and we have a wonderful code crew team uh which david ravinsky is part of the chat he's part of a team code crew and he you can find him in the code crew forum helping people out as well we have chris parker michaela mark spalding and a whole bunch of other members that help each other out so our forum codecrew.codewithchris.com really helpful place direct asserter have you a direct link for articles on your site um this one's kind of tough like we've written so much things over the years that i'm i'm really having trouble trying to surface them all um so my latest attempt and this is ever evolving is if you hit learn up here you're going to see uh first of all some resources that we want to highlight and then an index of you know our courses and where you can find things but down here um i've tried to cherry pick all of the articles that are still sort of relevant and not super out of date and list them here i know it's just a long list that might be kind of hard to go through but at this point this is this is what we have this is the best that we've done so far if you can think of another way to organize it let me know maybe we can split it up into um yeah i don't know maybe i should check out how what other people do um other content creators who have a ton of articles and how they organize it because definitely you know in addition to the website articles i have youtube videos too so how do they play together jira is a good tool for agile methodologies using scrum it's a continuous integration type of management yeah i think you know i haven't personally used jira for agile but i think in our old company when i used to be working professionally still we were exploring jira june chris do you have plans for a combined tutorial uh yeah i think i will eventually right now i'm still in the process of learning it um and i'm using mark mark moykins from big mountain studio his um his combined resource which makes it really easy to learn so combine i mean this this book is not um it's not super cheap but for someone who uh could actually use combine in their workplace i definitely think it's worth it guys give me a second here hello sorry guys back so uh my daughter was just looking for mommy and uh okay so what were we talking about here i think i was just answering questions yeah okay the other thing i wanted to show you here let's transition over to the cwc app so just to give you guys a little bit of context right now in the app store we do have a code with chris app but it's showing the ui kit tutorials and actually david ravinsky in this chat he's the one who built it for us so kudos to him um mark my kids no problem no problem i i constantly use your uh use your book so you know it's it's not a shout out without merit and yeah so i was talking about the cwc app we had some requests from cwc plus members that you know with these streaming platforms to learn sometimes you go on a plane sometimes you go on a train sometimes you're just disconnected and you want to be able to download the videos for offline access just like netflix or skillshare and whatnot and so we're looking into well we're kind of full into it building an app a cwc app and the idea is that it would serve as sort of an entry point as well for people in the app store to find us and start learning swift ui and then potentially maybe turn into a cwc plus member if they want to continue learning through the app or for existing cwc plus members to learn on the go to be able to download the lessons and such so the way that we're approaching this is let me just go back here uh we're we're doing this through mapping out um user journeys so there's this tool called lucid lucidchart or maybe lucid app or something like that and this is just a new tool that we found for we wanted something free and we wanted to be able to map out flows and if you guys know of a different tool that you use i'm sure i'm sure everyone has a tool for something like this let me know what you prefer in the chat for for this time we're just using lucid i don't really have a different tool but we mapped out the different journeys and this is going to basically tell us what to tackle first and uh what sort of different flows exist within this app and this um you know before even diving into technical requirements and app requirements and things like that you put yourself in the perspective of someone who is going to use your app what do you want them to be able to do through your app so here it starts with downloading and opening the app we want to prompt the user if they want to create a code with chris account and we're going to just assume the easiest flow now so they're going to say no but they should still be able to explore the app and view some of the free content that we have like the 14 day beginner challenge so they'll be able to even take that and watch the lessons and take those those courses and then for saving those lessons for offline access we are reserving that for people who have created an account so not necessarily a paid account even creating a free account but you must be logged in to be able to download lessons for offline so if they try to do that then we are going to prompt them for account creation if they don't do that then they just you know they complete the course and then we we say hey if you want to continue learning here we have this awesome foundations course that you can take uh and then we're gonna do an inapp purchase for them to sign up so that's that's one flow right the other flow is like they create an account they say yes and then they they just visit the returning user experience so we have another user flow for returning users and for this one it's very similar but as a returning user you already have an account so you're gonna log in and we have a couple of states here or error states and it depends if they are a cwc plus member then they get access to the entire course catalog and they can engage with all the courses and they can download lessons for offline access if they're not a cwc plus member they can still use all of our free content and also because they have logged in and they have an account they can save and watch videos locally even offline so these are the flows that are planned for now and obviously we can take this even further and we can add different features to it maybe gamification features or featuring news and announcements and things like that for now though this is what we've charted out because it sort of hits the main purpose for the app which is a to allow existing cwc plus members to have an app experience and download videos for offline access and then b to capture new a new audience through the app store who potentially you know could start learning ios with us um and the nice thing about charting out these user journeys is that now it makes it really easy for you to plan out what you want to do so for example when we are working on iterations here um because the the reason why we're planning it out this way with the different sprints like this is because um jesse who is actually an intern here from the university that i used to go to we went through the same internship program when i did computer science at that university we had the same program it's just really cool you alternate so four months you do school and then four months you get to um apply to different jobs and and those companies come and they hire these uh interns so it alternates and you get to try out a whole bunch of different companies i think about four or five different companies before you even graduate and what usually happens is on your last work term so in your last internship um those companies might hire you actually right from graduation so if you you know you have a strong performance they'll make you an offer and so you you might have a job secured before you even graduate so anyways um we are we hired jesse to come on board and he's been working here since june 1st and he's basically ramped up on swift ui i mean he had a programming background he's in computer science as well and that probably made it a little easier for him to to get up to speed so he's going to be working on this app he's going to be the main um the main driver of this i told him go learn some scrum you know how to manage sprints and scrums and things like that and uh help push this forward so i will so i'll be the one that will probably also work on this but you know i want to focus on cwc plus i want to focus on creating course content with you guys streaming with you guys hanging out with you guys and on some of those streams i actually might be working on this app as a as a developer so i think it's also a really cool experience i'm trying to give him as much responsibility as he can handle without overburdening him because i think that'll make a really cool work experience or a work term uh june are you from waterloo as well waterloo university that was the one that i i graduated from uh how do you so june asks how do you learn new ios technologies uh don't worry you're not asking a lot of questions i love it this is the sort of interaction that i really love with the streams that we've been doing um so how do i learn the other what was it in the last stream that i did for thursday i think that was a group study stream where i was just um learning something and i was working on something while you guys chat and i participated in the chat as well but how i learned was i downloaded i just do it the same way you guys do so it usually starts with a google search so that learning that i did on thursday was actually for this app i wanted to figure out how do you download an hls stream for offline viewing so you know that that is what i searched offline hls download or something like that right and i looked at a bunch of resources and apple actually had a they had a sample the problem was that it was done in ui kit and so on thursday when you guys saw me and i had the mic off i was transferring this demo taking trying to learn what exactly they were doing and taking bits out of this code and porting it over to my own swift ui version of the project and i didn't take everything i just took sort of bits and pieces that i needed but you know you can't just randomly take code out of one project without knowing what code you're taking so i had to understand what they were doing right and i tried to replicate that in my own project so yeah that's that's learning new technologies if there is no tutorial there's usually documentation for it so if i wanted to learn something like you know ar kit and i haven't played around with this before but there's a ton of documentation for it and you just gotta get your hands dirty you just have to try things out and hit some roadblocks overcome them and that's how the learning process happens actually funny story when i first graduated in my job first job one of the very first tasks i was assigned to was to figure out microsoft silverlight does anyone in the chat remember this hey pagasi nice to see you uh this thing was basically a flash competitor microsoft's flash competitor so when i started working my first job placement this was brand new and microsoft wanted to really push this so they were paying companies to build demos to showcase silverlight and to use it and to build cool things with silverlight so you know my my company got funding for this um but i was tasked to figure this out learn how to use it and there wasn't a lot of literature or documentation about this and i remember just staying late a lot of staying late a lot banging my head on a lot of things obviously i had a couple of contacts at microsoft because not my own contacts but you know through the company i was working at to talk about some of this stuff and to ask questions but you know this was obviously new to them as well and so yeah it's just a lot of trial and error a lot of bang your head against the wall blend yeah mark yeah blend with their uh design slash developer bridge tool um anyways you know it's crazy to me thinking about that and how technology changes i when i started code with chris i have expected this to last you know maybe two years or three years because ios would eventually fall out of flavor or fall out of favor and there would be new platforms coming up to take its place because so far in my university journey to you know the first maybe three or four years of my career i was just constantly learning different things learning new platforms um i i dabbled in flash i mean obviously there are ones that stood the test of time like java um you know a lot of web web technologies like javascript so that was all good but i learned a lot of flash stuff adobe flex all of the um the microsoft platforms sort of come and came and went there was a microsoft surface that it was really cool i got to work on this it was like a big table no not this thing a table top i don't know if any of you guys remember this actually this coffee table thing and that was use it used to be called microsoft surface now they used the word surface for uh their laptops or their tablets see it was this thing so i got to work on this thing it looks really cool you know the idea of having like a table top and to be able to put things on it and have the tabletop recognize what it was but back then how it actually worked was there were like four cameras under the table that would um i guess detect i i don't really know how it works but it would detect um shadows i don't know i'm speaking out of out of line here already but i got to work on this and as a new grad this was sort of cool because it was brand new not many people had seen it before and i got sent to uh different places in the u.s to work on client sites to build um apps for this so you can see they imagined a lot of different scenarios they imagined this to be in bars where you could put your drink on it and it would like tell you things you could browse menus right here um on the table anyways this is a tangent just reminiscing about the past all right where were we here yes we were talking about the sprints we're talking about uh how we're going to approach building this yes so our first user journey that we're going to do is the easiest one the most simple one it's going to be download and open the app the user is going to say no to registration they're going to be able to interact as a guest and check out all of the free content and view some videos so that is like the most basic flow and we're going to tackle this by user journey so this makes it uh really easy to segment what you're going to do and let's say that things take longer than expected and we get to like our last sprints because jesse has to go back to school and we get back to the last sprint and we've only gotten you know two out of the five user journeys that we had mapped out well that's still a functional app right rather than spending 11 sprints building like the foundation and then at the end of the day you still don't have something that you can publish and people can use so i think this is a really good way to approach it so we're taking this first basic user journey like this is what we want the person to be able to do and we are breaking it out into the tasks that we need to we need to do in order to make that happen and then we are going to plan it out via the across the different sprints so you can see there are a whole bunch of discovery that we had to do for example the courses and the lessons are hosted on a platform called thinkific that's what we use to host all of our content so they had an api and we needed to check that out um the code with chris website is on wordpress so all of the user accounts information uh you know to authenticate users that's on wordpress so that's a completely different platform and we needed to figure out okay across those two different platforms what are we going to do how are we going to connect it to this app uh things like that so anyways that's just a little behind the scenes that sort of this is the next three months i would say maybe two and a half months so uh maybe i'll give you guys an update and you'll probably see me working on some of these tasks on the stream as well so i want to give you guys a little update on the instagram analytics app so if you remember from back then this was with our um previous intern bowen and he's actually coming back to help us parttime because he's he's in school right so he's helping us parttime on this new app with jesse so it's going to be really cool to have multiple people working on it and obviously we have our designer jc who's also there but bowen worked on the instagram analytics app to analyze other people's profiles and give you insights on what other people are doing so that was the app that we built during his internship here and we we did this three month app case study where we i made bowen uh do daily updates on what he was working on and so we have all of these weeks here and i also gave behind the scenes footage because i was pretty in touch with what he was doing so he would write his daily update and i would sort of shoot a video and um and show you guys behind the scenes how things were looking like so that video let me show you the sprints here so you can see same sort of thing but this is for the instagram analytics app and he completed all of these sprints so that's really cool and again bowen came into our company he didn't know he didn't even know swift he didn't even know swift ui so like that really proves to you how quickly you can learn these things right it's but obviously um he probably had an advantage as well because he he was studying computer science and he knew other languages so that definitely gave him a leg up so anyways i want to give you guys an update on that because we had never built an app before to try to get users and try to gain traction so we really didn't know what we were doing and we had some assumptions so we wrote them down uh as to what we thought the process would look like into this product framework and this is something that i imagine to be a work in progress that we would continually refine uh these steps so our current framework was for the instagram app was to have an idea and then validate that with the people uh the market to see if it's something that people would want prototype it and i guess are we missing a build part this prototype oh yes because we wanted to prototype it and i guess what we release with the instagram app is a prototype because we really it's a subset of all the features we have imagined from it uh to get initial users iterate next steps and all that so this that validate actually took it takes a lot longer than we had thought and so during bowen's time here we didn't have enough time to go through this properly and so we decided that um we were gonna go forward anyways and i think that was that was sort of bad but at the same time um our hands were kind of tied so it's almost like right now what we've done with the app is like we've built it we've released our prototype um but now we need to collect feedback and turn it into mold it into something that people would actually want whereas i think you know this step should come first with the cwc app this is not so much an issue because i know you guys and those of you who are in the cwc plus program would immediately find value from this so this is not so much of an issue here but the way that we're approaching how to build this is already different just based on doing user journeys like this this we didn't do any of this with the instagram analytics app that we built before so anyways let me jump into the app store to show you guys uh jeff what is the cwc app it's an app that we are working on to basically for existing members to have an app experience with cwc plus so they can download all of the lessons for offline viewing as well as for new people to find us through the app store and get introduced to our brand all right thank you rose for joining hi pratham okay cool let me where's that that window i had yeah oh looks like i gotta log in again give me a second so i really didn't know what to expect with this because we had launched it and we had not planned to market this very heavily because i didn't feel like this was the end state yet and i feel like i needed to get enough feedback to iterate on it to turn it into something that people wanted to use before like heavily trying to promote it but it's sort of like a chicken and egg scenario because if you don't have people using it how are you going to get the feedback to improve it so i think that was the wrong move that was the lesson learned i think you do have to get it out there um and get people using it so you can collect feedback but make sure you have a feedback mechanism in place right otherwise people are just using it you can't collect the feedback so without any marketing at all uh i guess publishing our updates on youtube was a form of marketing too but i mean we haven't done any paid advertising we haven't like tried to publish articles or something so this is just organic downloads from the app store just people searching for maybe instagram analytics and finding the app you can see that maybe on average it's a profile scorecards is is the name of the instagram analytics app so you can see that there's a there's a bunch maybe four to five a day i would say this is organic um yeah there's nothing to buy in the app right now there's no monetization because that sort of wasn't the focus right now uh there's no banner ads or anything like so no money is being made from this um yeah but eventually i wanted to introduce some sort of monetization to it so i wanted to have like an option to purchase to get some premium features and that sort of thing this is the first time hearing about the app yeah so this instagram analytics app was actually the the three month case study in our cwc uh plus course that we did this this guy right here so our current plan with how we're going to you know what we're going to do with this app um is after wwdc which is now uh we were then going to take a look at the roadmap for this but i think the next step for this is like i actually have to get into the community of people who are focused on their instagram account and want to build it and get their feedback get some feedback because just organically people downloading this i'm not getting enough people using it to really get a sense of whether or not this is helpful for people right we can look at um yeah we can look at how how many people actually return retention that's the word i'm looking for retention and how many people come back to use the app um but i have that somewhere else in another in another platform for analytics so maybe i'll show you guys that next time but i think the next step for me is like i need to get some feedback on this app actually find out if it's useful and if it's not so useful find out what's missing um and then just iterate on that and that's how actually even code with chris has gotten to this point we've tried so many things that really hasn't worked um until we got to this point where you know i think we're reaching a lot more people than before and um yeah we've tried so many different tools so many different workflows so many different things it's just persistence and and iteration i feel like those those are some of the most important skills pagassi we are making a cwc app yeah we are making a cwc app for members of the program to download videos to view offline and also for people to find us through the app store so this is currently an app that's going on um don't know how or if i am going to share this as a case study because i haven't really organized it that way uh but i'll probably share updates with you guys on the stream and i'll be working on tasks on this as well if anything i might as we continue working on the instagram analytics app i'll continue to update the case study here and provide updates there because we're not giving up on this instagram analytics app um i think we've the idea is still unproven right until we actually prove that this is not something that people want and even then if we can't pivot into a direction that people you know that's something that they want we won't be giving up on this app so i really want to crack that code on like how how to make money on the app store because i feel like a lot of people have that aspiration and i can't give you a straight answer on how to do that as well and unless you you know obviously you can hit the jackpot and you can come up with something that has a perfect um fit to what people are looking for and you sort of capitalize on that trend and it just takes off as a rocket ship but i think that's more of the anomaly i think now um more than ever you're building something and you you're treating the app like a business you're not just building an app and then building another one building another one and expect to find success i think you have to iterate on the app and slowly morph it and transform it into its ultimate form where it you know it is pulling in a ton of revenue for you and then at that point you add the paid advertising and scale it up even more anyways those are just my my thoughts obviously unvalidated but that's what i find so interesting about doing this is because i want to i want to figure out this puzzle jeff you had an idea for building a fitness yoga and health app yeah i think the health the health space is really really good to be in because that will never go away people will always be looking for ways to be healthier right to keep fit that's sort of like a basic human need whereas something like this right instagram might go um the way that i was thinking about this instagram analytics before was that uh i was targeting uh maybe people who would be willing to invest in a tool like this to increase their social presence of people who are trying to turn this their instagram profile like into a business so i thought that uh monetizing those types of users um they'd be more willing to spend money because they're spending money to make money essentially but i think the health space definitely is is a great place to be in health and food yeah diet oh man does do you guys work out regularly like keep fit do you guys do uh yoga or stretching you know actually one thing i've always wanted to talk about on this channel which i haven't yet is how we are always on our computers i don't know how how often you guys are on your computers but over time you develop this hunched posture right like your arms are like this your shoulders roll forward and if you're not someone who actively you know who is not active then you're constantly sitting you're constantly hunched forward your neck goes forward and you just get into a really bad posture and i've been trying to correct that posture uh for probably a year now on and off um there are yeah show you guys so you guys might have seen this being advertised on youtube ads or whatever it's it's basically like a back brace and you're supposed to wear it like this and it's supposed to pull your shoulders back and people are trying to sell this thing for like thirty dollars or forty dollars but just go on aliexpress.com and i bought it for five dollars and i wanted to see what it's like so it basically pulls my shoulders back and keeps me in this posture but after using this for a while what i realized is that having this is not going to change your posture it it sort of reminds you because it keeps you from slouching forward but ultimately what you have to do is you have to strengthen the muscles that are weak in your back because of constant hunch and neck forward posture um so you you need to strengthen the muscles to um counterbalance because your body essentially is out of balance now some muscles are stronger and tighter than others and then also neck posture one next stretch that i found really helpful with forward forward neck posture is chin tuck so you go like this so you look like you have a double chin and you go forward and back and forward and back not really fast but do it in a controlled manner and you will hear like some some cracking maybe that's the wrong word because it sounds really extreme but you'll basically release you'll release your neck and it'll feel really good so anyways if you guys are interested in that sort of stuff um let me know i might talk more about it and then there's a you know your hip flexors get tight when you sit a lot so i think maybe because i'm getting older now i'm definitely concerned more about posture and how you know what we're doing to our bodies as we're sitting in this chair and staring at a screen all day yeah issa trying to work out regularly especially since covid not just for physical health but for deaf folks who stare at screens a lot yeah for mental health as well that's good that's good jeff you have online classes for eight hours it's really annoying yeah even even my kids right now because they're doing online schooling so they're staring at a screen all day and i just don't know sort of what sort of impact that has on them because i feel like children should be outside they should be interacting live with with other kids but it is what it is right now actually right now i am fasting and i know it's it's sort of like a trendy thing right now but uh i've been doing it for the last 112 days in a row so i use this app and i actually learned about this app from from revenue cat in their podcast it's called xero and basically i am almost done my fast 30 minutes until i can eat so it's basically uh for me i'm doing an eight hour eating window so i eat from noon to 8 pm and then after that um i don't eat until the following day at noon and so i've been doing this for the screen will load i can show you guys yeah see a hundred and twelve consecutive days so this is pretty cool um and how has it been going well when i combined fasting with uh eating right and like you obviously can't stuff your face with junk during the eight hours but it was actually working to lose uh lose weight if that is your primary concern for me losing weight was kind of just a side benefit but i wanted to see if it would give me more energy right and it would basically just help me in terms of general health and now i've done it for this long it doesn't even feel like i'm doing anything i like i don't feel hungry during the times i don't have to eat uh and well actually one of the big things that it helped curb was eating at night um we had a bad habit ellen and i to sit on the couch at night watch netflix open a bag of popcorn or whatever whatever snack it may be and you know we would snack we would snack and i don't think that's bad within reason but um we were not really within reason i feel and so ever since we started doing this fasting app and i think part of the success that the reason for the success we've had with it for adhering to it is because we're both doing it we're both on board imagine i'm fasting at night and she's you know munching on chips and i don't think that would work so you know we've both been fasting we've been doing this thing uh it's been working out really well basically cold turkey cut all of the snacking at night so i don't know there's something for you you to try if you're trying to curb a bad habit in terms of eating pegasi that the circular progress bars they look good but i can't find good videos for basic progress bar work anywhere beyond super basic because everyone wants to talk about the circle um yeah there are actually a ton of tutorials on there but why why aren't they working out for you like what's wrong with the existing tutorials because one of the app challenges which jesse has done is a hydration app and it uses a um it uses a circular progress bar and when i looked at the code it was actually really easy to do so maybe you can let me know why the existing tutorials out there don't really fit what you're looking for sergio uh you're doing keto keto is i think it's even harder to do i tried that for uh this was years ago when i tried keto uh it was really tough because you can't have any sugar not even from fruits and stuff if i remember correctly and i i was like making my own chocolate because i guess when you go on keto you try to find replacements for that sugar that you've been missing right and so guys hold on sorry about that um what platform do you use to track your timeline such as days for habits like fasting uh i use this app called xero it's free so i mean you can pay for it but i'm not paying for it it you can use all of this for free it'll tell you it you know what you know what it is like you don't really need an app for this but i find that you know just having some button to press to say like okay now you're going to fasting and then another button to press that you're done you're fasting it's sort of like a mental switch for you um and then also it tracks your statistics so it gives you like encouragement like oh you've done how many days in a row and uh it really helps motivate you because you don't want to break the streak so that's all it does and you can use all this for free this is the xero app sergio peanut butter peanut butter peanut butter keto friendly or are you talking about specifically keto friendly peanut butters i don't remember was i eating a lot of peanut butter so many years ago i don't remember but actually it worked so i was on keto for maybe um a month i think um and actually worked but it's hard um if you have a family because you have to prepare different foods unless you put your kids on keto as well pagassi you wanted circle bars but put text in the center but basic progress bars require text outside of the bar i want text zed stacked on the basic bar but in swift ui okay so maybe maybe i'll show you what what jesse did it wasn't he didn't use the progress bar control if if that's what you're talking about um it was literally like drawing circles you said you'd eat your phone after day two yeah as long as the peanut butter doesn't have sugar and daily carb is less than 20 grams it sounds like you're well into keto how long have you been doing it for all right guys i have to go soon um almost lunch time with the family but the next time i'll stream is probably on thursday so check out the stream schedule yeah so i i think it might just be a study session i don't really have anything planned right now i'm sort of planning these on the fly as i'm going but it's great to chat with you guys regardless um just to hang out we'll probably do some studying and some coding it's hard for me to actually code on stream in 1080p right now so if i do do coding it might be 7 20 which kind of kind of sucks yeah i gotta hold up for one more week until the mac mini comes and then we'll stream in 1080p yeah sergio it's hard to it's hard to do keto diet with the with your family and friends if you're preparing your own food then i guess that's not really a problem pegasi will uh i'll share the code that he used in the code crew forum so maybe i'll help you maybe that's what you're looking for no he didn't even use a bezier path or bezier path it was even more simple than that um it was literally a circle with the with just the stroke with a trim to cut out the segment that's missing on the progress and then a rotate anyways i'll show you that code it might be what you're looking for alessandro oh no worries i'm going to be streaming again on thursday so hope to see you there uh will there be new courses on the cwc uh we it will but my pro priority right now is to finish the databases app sorry databases course so right now we are on the last module of the databases course where it really is just getting people introduced to core data firestore database and setting up the prerequisites so that we can start using those skills to build other apps the design course actually is also underway and that's going to move faster because we have two people working on it the designer who's going to be doing the design parts and myself who who's going to show you how to integrate those design assets into xcode so i have a feeling that course is gonna go you know double time and then after that we're gonna be building um apps using all the skills you've learned in the foundations course the database course and the design course together and and yeah it'll be cool it'll be cool because then we can build some cooler stuff if you've gone through those three courses and by the way if anyone is thinking about joining cwc plus today is the last day for our wdc sale no pressure though we always have sales so issa thank you so much for for pointing students our way awesome uh thank you so much srianz thank you easy visual studio i'm not sure does anyone have an idea um about using visual studio i don't think so to be honest i did see something like that before i thought i saw visual studio somewhere but i don't know in what context visual studio for swift yeah you might want to check some of this out i haven't looked into it myself you know what like you might be able to compile swift however you won't get like the ide and xcode for using swift ui i don't think ronin welcome to cwc plus thank you so much for your support i hope you enjoy it yeah sergio yeah finding food without sugar sugars and everything isn't everything so hard is he says the database course different from the firebase stuff that you have from before um i guess the it would i would say yes because it is in a swift ui context the database stuff from before was working in a ui kit context so the syntax is different uh where things are are a little different but in terms of uh how the database works um you know if you get the gist of how to do the crud operations with the database that still is the same it's just syntactically is a little different because of swift ui that's all so you don't have you know it's not going to be completely uh brand new for you if you've already done it before all right guys i gotta call it a date but thank you so much for joining and
