00:06 - hey YouTubers I hope you guys are all
00:08 - doing well in this quick video I just
00:10 - want to show you guys what we'll be
00:11 - building in the next few lessons with
00:13 - parse now this particular demo is
00:16 - actually from my iOS toolbox course uh
00:19 - but we're going to rebuild this demo and
00:21 - instead of using MySQL like this demo
00:23 - does uh we're going to use parse as our
00:25 - backend but this app demonstrates uh
00:29 - using a back end for your app and how
00:30 - you can send and retrieve data across
00:33 - different devices so in this particular
00:36 - demo all you do is you type in a message
00:40 - here and when you hit send it saves that
00:44 - message to the database and then it
00:46 - retrieves the list of new messages so
00:48 - whether you launch this app on another
00:51 - device or you close this app and you uh
00:55 - open it again or you uninstall it and
00:57 - reinstall it um all of these mess
00:59 - mesages will still be there because
01:01 - they're stored in the database and the
01:03 - app actually uh communicates with the
01:06 - backend to retrieve those
01:08 - messages I guess you could call it the
01:10 - beginnings of a chat app and maybe if we
01:13 - have time we'll even style it and make
01:14 - it look a little prettier all right I
01:16 - can't wait to get started with you guys
01:18 - and I'll see you guys in the next lesson
01:20 - bye for
01:22 - [Music]
01:28 - now
