With timestamps:

00:00 - uikit did you know that UI stands for
00:02 - user interface you've used this library
00:04 - several times before mostly through the
00:06 - storyboard by dragging objects from the
00:09 - object library to your view and I
00:11 - mentioned that all of those elements
00:12 - that you're dragging from the object
00:14 - library there are objects of classes
00:16 - that are in UI kit so in this lesson I'd
00:20 - like to dive a little deeper into UI kit
00:22 - and tell you all about it and what it
00:24 - involves this webpage which I'll link to
00:26 - below the video is the reference page
00:28 - for UI kit you can see the classes that
00:31 - UI kit contains for instance if we go
00:33 - into views and controls under user
00:36 - interface you'll see those elements that
00:39 - are related to views and controls so for
00:42 - example we have used this UI image view
00:45 - class if you click into it you're going
00:47 - to see all of the methods and properties
00:50 - for that class and some of the more
00:52 - popular elements in UI kit will actually
00:55 - contain an article telling you how to
00:57 - perform common tasks with that class but
01:00 - if you scroll all the way to the bottom
01:03 - starting from this grayed out topics
01:06 - area you're going to see properties and
01:09 - you can tell that they are property by
01:11 - this VAR keyword here that's the name of
01:13 - the property followed by the datatype
01:16 - for that property if you click into it
01:18 - and it looks like this page is broken
01:21 - right now
01:22 - or maybe that link is broken I'm sure
01:24 - it's going to get fixed soon because
01:26 - that property for a UI image view is the
01:28 - most popular one it's the one that you
01:31 - set the image to display let's try to
01:33 - clicking a different one yeah and you
01:35 - should get a page like this that is
01:37 - going to give you a discussion about
01:40 - what that property is and what it does
01:42 - and it's going to give you some related
01:44 - items and if you click a function we
01:47 - scroll down a little bit you can see
01:50 - that functions have the function keyword
01:52 - and if you click into that you will get
01:57 - this one doesn't accept any parameters
01:59 - so it's kind of a bad example but if
02:02 - this function did a set parameters you
02:04 - would see a description of what each
02:06 - parameter is what it expects and why you
02:09 - need to supply that parameter
02:11 - no it doesn't look like actually we can
02:15 - click into one of these initializers
02:17 - like this so here for this you're gonna
02:20 - have a parameter section it's going to
02:22 - describe each parameter that you need to
02:24 - supply and if there are return values
02:27 - that would be under here as well so this
02:29 - documentation is great for looking up
02:33 - information on uiq classes however this
02:36 - is not the only way to access this
02:38 - information for example a lot of the
02:40 - times when I'm working with a class that
02:42 - I don't recognize I will just do a quick
02:44 - Google search for that class so here
02:46 - I've searched for UI image view and
02:48 - actually if that class has an apple
02:51 - developer documentation page for it
02:53 - usually it will be the first result so I
02:55 - find that just googling the class name
02:57 - is sometimes just faster to getting to
03:00 - this page then it is navigating through
03:03 - all of this stuff you know the actual UI
03:07 - kit framework page now another way that
03:10 - you can access this information is
03:12 - actually from within Xcode so here i've
03:16 - got a brand new Xcode project and I just
03:19 - wanted to demonstrate how you can access
03:20 - that same documentation from within
03:22 - Xcode so for example if I just declare a
03:26 - new image view here let's create that
03:31 - image view object and if I just put my
03:34 - cursor on that class and I look over on
03:37 - this right-hand side and there is this
03:40 - tab here and the inspector pane it says
03:42 - a quick help inspector and here it tells
03:45 - you exactly what it is here so it's a
03:48 - class UI image view it is a subclass of
03:52 - UI view which is something you're going
03:53 - to learn in the following lesson so
03:55 - ignore that part for now but this
03:57 - description tells you what that class is
03:59 - and then you can see here it's declared
04:02 - an UI kit and you can click this class
04:05 - reference link and it will actually
04:08 - launch this window that is showing you
04:12 - the exact same page however this is just
04:15 - from within Xcode this is the same page
04:18 - that we saw through the website
04:22 - we can scroll all the way down here
04:24 - under topics you can see all of the
04:27 - functions and properties and actually
04:29 - let's try clicking this one the same
04:31 - link that was broken before oh and it
04:34 - works here so maybe just doing it in app
04:37 - is easier you don't have to go to Google
04:39 - search or anything like that alright so
04:41 - let me close this window for now we're
04:42 - going to actually get back to this
04:44 - window in just a second and I'll talk
04:46 - more about that but I want to show you
04:48 - yet another way to access documentation
04:51 - from with an Xcode so you just saw that
04:54 - I can put my cursor here and going over
04:56 - to the inspector pane on this quick
04:59 - inspector tab you can see some info here
05:02 - you can also just hold down alt on your
05:05 - keyboard and you can immediately see
05:07 - that if your cursor is over a class name
05:11 - you see that question mark don't know if
05:13 - you can see but if I hover off the class
05:14 - it just turns into this a little plus
05:17 - cursor but if I actually hover over the
05:18 - class you can see it's a question mark
05:20 - now if I click it you're gonna see just
05:22 - the context menu pop up and this
05:27 - information is just exactly what's here
05:29 - in this quick help but it's even faster
05:31 - you don't have to put your cursor in it
05:33 - and then go over to the tab and change
05:35 - over to this quick help tab or anything
05:37 - like that and again from here you can
05:39 - click on the class reference link and
05:41 - out pops this end and in fact it just
05:44 - saved where we were last time so there's
05:48 - a uiimageview
05:49 - now I just showed you some techniques to
05:51 - find out more information about a class
05:53 - that you are currently using that you're
05:56 - not sure about however what if you
05:59 - aren't working with a class and you're
06:00 - instead you're looking for a class to
06:02 - see if there's maybe an existing class
06:05 - and you like it that does something that
06:06 - you want to do already in that case you
06:09 - want to browse so you can either go
06:11 - through that webpage like I showed you
06:13 - this is the uikit reference page again
06:16 - the link is below and you can kind of go
06:18 - through these sections and you can
06:19 - browse another cool way to do it is
06:22 - actually from within the app so in here
06:25 - you can go up to window and then look
06:30 - for developer documentation and
06:32 - when you click that you're going to get
06:35 - this documentation window that we saw
06:37 - earlier and you can actually search for
06:39 - it or on the left hand side there's this
06:43 - button that will bring this pane out if
06:45 - you don't have it under UIKit you can
06:48 - more easily just click on these
06:51 - different classes expand these notes
06:53 - we're gonna work with a lot of these
06:55 - classes actually in the course but this
06:58 - is a good way to browse instead if you
07:00 - don't really know what you're looking
07:01 - for so for example under controls you
07:04 - have buttons and date pickers and page
07:08 - controls sliders stuff like that if
07:10 - you're not sure if you I could have the
07:12 - class that does something you want to do
07:14 - already you can just open up the
07:17 - developer documentation and do some
07:19 - browsing all right so in this lesson you
07:21 - learned about where to find information
07:23 - on the uikit classes and also where to
07:25 - find that documentation from within
07:27 - Xcode and just to remind you guys you
07:30 - can go to the Apple UIKit webpage or you
07:32 - can just type in that class name into
07:34 - Google and usually that top result is
07:36 - that reference page you can also put
07:38 - your typing cursor on the function name
07:40 - or on the class name and then on the
07:42 - right hand side and xcode in the
07:44 - inspector panel you're going to get some
07:45 - quick help information about that and
07:48 - don't forget you can hold down the
07:49 - option key on your keyboard and then go
07:51 - ahead and click that function or that
07:53 - class name again to bring up quick help
07:55 - and finally in xcode you can go up to
07:57 - the window menu developer documentation
07:59 - and bring up that in app reference guide
08:02 - that is also searchable so that's really
08:05 - great so that stuff is going to come in
08:07 - real handy as you're building your app
08:09 - and you're learning all of the classes
08:11 - that you can use if you like this video

Cleaned transcript:

uikit did you know that UI stands for user interface you've used this library several times before mostly through the storyboard by dragging objects from the object library to your view and I mentioned that all of those elements that you're dragging from the object library there are objects of classes that are in UI kit so in this lesson I'd like to dive a little deeper into UI kit and tell you all about it and what it involves this webpage which I'll link to below the video is the reference page for UI kit you can see the classes that UI kit contains for instance if we go into views and controls under user interface you'll see those elements that are related to views and controls so for example we have used this UI image view class if you click into it you're going to see all of the methods and properties for that class and some of the more popular elements in UI kit will actually contain an article telling you how to perform common tasks with that class but if you scroll all the way to the bottom starting from this grayed out topics area you're going to see properties and you can tell that they are property by this VAR keyword here that's the name of the property followed by the datatype for that property if you click into it and it looks like this page is broken right now or maybe that link is broken I'm sure it's going to get fixed soon because that property for a UI image view is the most popular one it's the one that you set the image to display let's try to clicking a different one yeah and you should get a page like this that is going to give you a discussion about what that property is and what it does and it's going to give you some related items and if you click a function we scroll down a little bit you can see that functions have the
