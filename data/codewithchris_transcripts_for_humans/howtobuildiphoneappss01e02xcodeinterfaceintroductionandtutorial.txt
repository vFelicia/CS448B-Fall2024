00:08 - Alright, so I've got the previous project
that we started with in the last episode
00:13 - open right now
00:15 - and if you don't know how we got here
please check out the first episode
00:20 - where we created this project.
00:22 - In this video, i'm going to go over the
XCode interface with you guys
00:27 - and to be honest, i don't even know
everything
00:31 - about xcode but i'm going go through some
of the common features that
00:36 - I use most
00:37 - day-to-day in my programming.
00:41 - So
00:42 - at a glance,
00:43 - this is your code editor window,
right here in the middle.
00:48 - This on the left hand side is your
file tree so you can see all the files
00:53 - with your project
00:54 - and if you ever need to add files to your
project, you can just right click in the
00:59 - folder
01:00 - and you can either add existing files or
you can choose a new code file that you
01:05 - want that add.
01:06 - If you want to create new folders
which is really handy to organize your
01:10 - project, you can do something like this
where
01:13 - you choose "New Group"
01:14 - and then you can type
01:16 - something like "view controllers" or
whatever you want to do to organize
01:21 - your project.
01:22 - We'll go over that as well
01:24 - what are some best practices in
terms for ordering your files
01:28 - so it's not a mess for the person
01:31 - who is also working with you on
this project.
01:35 - You've got some little tabs up here
01:37 - on the left hand window.
01:39 - This one i use a lot. This one is
just searching for anything.
01:45 - Oftentimes you'll want to look for
some sort of keyword or some
01:50 - snippet, so you can type in something
like, for example, "app delegate"
01:55 - there and its going to tell you all the 
files in your project
01:59 - which contain
02:01 - your search keyword right there
02:03 - and
02:05 - tapping that will just open that file.
02:07 - Now if you guys,
02:08 - any guys coming from Visual Studio and
the Microsoft
02:11 - side, 
02:12 - you're going to be used to double
clicking
02:15 - to open a file.
02:17 - I struggled that at first but if
you do that here,
02:20 - you'll actually open it in a 
brand new window which in
02:23 - most cases, you're not intending to
do.
02:27 - This is useful if you want to
02:29 - put this on an external monitor
and have two code windows open
02:34 - but
02:35 - for the most part clicking it once
02:37 - will bring you to the file.
02:40 - In this pane right here, you can see all the
warnings and
02:42 - the errors
02:43 - when you build your project
02:45 - and
02:48 - this is all your
breakpoints here. So just quickly,
02:52 - to set breakpoints in your project, you
would
02:55 - just click on the side there. And
02:57 - for those of you who are just starting
out
02:59 - programming, essentially what
breakpoints are, is that it's going to
03:04 - stop execution of code at that point
03:07 - and that will allow you to check
03:10 - things like variables and
03:12 - it also allows you to step
through your code, step-by-step,
03:17 - so that
03:18 - you can make sure that
03:20 - it's doing what you're expecting
03:23 - it to do. And up here, in the upper left hand corner
03:26 - this button that we clicked last time
to run our project
03:31 - and its basically going to launch the simulator,
03:34 - you see that little arrow there. If you
hold it, you can actually do
03:38 - several different things here.
03:41 - We can get into those options
03:44 - in the future
03:46 - but for now lets move on. The stop button
here
03:48 - will stop the
03:49 - execution of your app
03:51 - and bring you back into XCode.
03:55 - If you've got different simulators
you can actually choose them here so for
03:59 - example i can choose to run this as an
iPad app
04:03 - and can see what that would look like
or an iPhone and
04:06 - if you have different
04:08 - SDKs installed,
04:10 - for example, iOS 5 or
04:12 - 4.3
04:13 - you'd be able to choose it and test it on
those
04:16 - OSes here.
04:19 - This is a
04:20 - big general toggle for all of your
breakpoints
04:24 - in your
04:26 - project. One thing we didn't
go through is actually if you set a
04:29 - breakpoint, like so. You see that blue arrow there?
04:32 - If you want to disable
04:33 - a single breakpoint you can tap it,
you can see that it gets dimmed out. Or you can
04:37 - actually just pull it off
04:40 - and it will blow up in a puff of smoke.
04:44 - Okay so these two arrows, these things
are useful. So
04:48 - it basically acts like a back button
like you would expect in your browser
04:52 - allows you to
04:54 - go backwards through the files that
you've been visiting and forwards.
05:01 - This thing, right here, is almost like a
breadcrumb of
05:05 - the files you're looking at so
essentially,
05:09 - you could very quickly jumped to
different files like this.
05:15 - And up here in the upper right-hand
corner,
05:18 - you see this little
05:19 - tuxedo icon?
05:21 - What that will actually do is open up an
05:24 - assistant editor.
05:25 - And
05:27 - it basically opens up the corresponding
file that's related to the file you're
05:31 - looking at. So for example,
05:33 - if i'm looking at the
05:35 - Viewcontroller.m,
05:36 - it's gonna open up Viewcontroller.h.
05:39 - And that's very helpful because
sometimes you want to reference what sort
05:43 - of properties and variables
05:45 - and
05:46 - method signatures you've declared in
your header file,
05:50 - while you're working in your
05:52 - implementation file. This just helps you
05:55 - you know, if i were in my single view,
this helps you
05:59 - not have to switch between them like
06:05 - so. These
06:06 - ones right here will just
06:08 - slide in these panels as you
06:10 - see fit.
06:13 - This right hand side here basically
gives you more information about the
06:17 - file you're looking at.
06:19 - For the most part
06:22 - if you're working in code, this is not so
useful but when you're working with
06:26 - storyboards and XIBs
06:27 - and stuff,
06:29 - this panel
06:31 - will be more useful because you can
06:33 - you can drag elements onto the screen from
here and
06:37 - do that kind of stuff.
06:39 - So I'm going to hide that for now.
06:42 - This button here, "Organizer", is going to
be stuff
06:45 - like provisioning profiles which we'll
get into it in the future.
06:50 - That opened in another window.
06:54 - There's some stuff in my organizer that
i can't show you. Some sort of information
07:02 - from work.
07:03 - So i'm going to close that. I'll show you
guys in the future video but
07:07 - basically what you want to use organizer
for is
07:11 - either for source repositories if you're
going to check in your code somewhere,
07:15 - managing provisioning profiles,
which are important if you're going to
07:19 - be deploying your app onto devices for
testing and eventually into app store,
07:25 - for documentation purposes,
07:28 - stuff like that.
07:30 - Down here, you're going be using this a lot,
this little tray down here, which you can
07:35 - pop up
07:36 - and pop down. This is your
07:40 - debug window or console window.
07:43 - So you're going to be able to
07:45 - basically, if you set a breakpoint and you
halt execution, you're going to be able to check on
07:51 - the different variables and
07:53 - basically debug,
07:56 - help debug your app,
07:57 - and we'll see how that works in the
future.
08:03 - So that was your basic introduction to
the XCode interface.
08:06 - For those of you guys who have a
programming background,
08:10 - this probably makes sense to you. Just the
environment maybe a little
08:15 - unfamiliar.
08:16 - But for those of you guys who don't have
any
08:19 - development background
08:20 - or programming experience,
08:23 - the terminology that i've used might
08:25 - go over your head. Stuff like breakpoints and
header
08:28 - and implementation files and stuff
like that but don't worry and stick with it.
08:33 - The more you code,
the more you watch
08:37 - It's all going to make sense and
it's going to come together for you guys.
08:40 - And you're
08:41 - going to be building really cool apps soon.
08:44 - You know i've seen a lot of
08:45 - YouTube videos out there
08:47 - teaching you how to build your first
application and it's just a series of
08:51 - here, click this, do this, type this and
that's something that i want to
08:55 - avoid doing
08:57 - because i want you guys to be able to
09:00 - actually learn and not just follow
09:02 - a bunch of steps.
09:04 - Because eventually,
09:06 - you know, i'm teaching you guys how to fish
so that you can fish for yourself and not
09:10 - just giving you the fish, if
09:12 - you've heard that parable before.
09:14 - So
09:16 - there's going to be a little pain in
learning but you're going to reap the
09:19 - benefits.
09:21 - All right, so until the next video, i'll
see you guys soon. Bye!

Cleaned transcript:

Alright, so I've got the previous project that we started with in the last episode open right now and if you don't know how we got here please check out the first episode where we created this project. In this video, i'm going to go over the XCode interface with you guys and to be honest, i don't even know everything about xcode but i'm going go through some of the common features that I use most daytoday in my programming.
