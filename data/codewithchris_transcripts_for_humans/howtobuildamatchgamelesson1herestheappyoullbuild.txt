00:00 - guys welcome to module three in this
00:02 - module you'll be building this app as
00:04 - you can see it's a huge jump from the
00:06 - war card game but you are ready for it
00:09 - by completing this project you'll learn
00:11 - the following things how to properly
00:14 - structure a project following a proven
00:15 - design pattern so that your code will be
00:18 - easy to maintain in debug how to do
00:20 - animations and to play sound files
00:22 - how'd it incorporate timers into your
00:24 - app how to do a grits tile layout for
00:27 - your view how do you use a critical
00:29 - communication pattern to respond to
00:30 - events that UIKit elements raise this is
00:34 - a common stumbling block for many
00:35 - beginners but it's so crucial because
00:37 - all UI kit elements communicate this way
00:40 - and I'll show you exactly how that works
00:42 - you'll also learn how to show alerts to
00:44 - the user how to debug and fix your own
00:46 - code using Xcode tools and finally how
00:50 - to create and use custom classes in
00:52 - addition to those new skills that you'll
00:54 - be learning you're also going to be
00:56 - reinforcing the skills that you've
00:57 - already learned such as displaying
00:59 - images handling user interaction using
01:02 - arrays and laying out your elements so
01:04 - that they work on multiple screen sizes
01:06 - and orientations lastly by completing
01:09 - this app you're going to have another
01:10 - app to add to your pool of experience so
01:13 - that when it comes time to build your
01:14 - own app you have more experiences to
01:17 - draw from if you're excited to get
01:19 - started on this app like I am let me
01:21 - know by writing hey-ya in the comment
01:23 - section below now I want to see a bunch
01:26 - of hell yes don't make me look like a
01:27 - fool I'm counting on you guys okay
01:29 - lastly don't forget to subscribe to the
01:31 - code with Kris channel by hitting that
01:33 - red button below and if you don't want
01:35 - to miss a single video hit that Bell
01:36 - icon as well thanks for watching I'll
01:38 - see you guys in the next lesson
