00:05 - hello this is Chris and welcome to
00:07 - lesson three of how to make iPhone apps
00:09 - with no programming experience so in
00:12 - this lesson we're going to walk through
00:14 - do a little tutorial of xcode the
00:17 - program which you will be spending a lot
00:19 - of time in to build apps and every year
00:21 - or two apple rolls out a new version but
00:23 - not uh the changes there are changes
00:26 - between the different versions but it's
00:28 - not so drastic that you'll have to learn
00:30 - everything a new it's kind of like uh
00:32 - how Adobe rolls out new versions of
00:34 - Photoshop and each iteration has new
00:37 - features and stuff like that but at the
00:39 - core the core product is still there and
00:42 - you know if you know how to use one
00:44 - version you'll be pretty well versed in
00:46 - the next version so in this video we're
00:48 - going to go through the major sections
00:50 - of the xcode interface that you'll be
00:52 - using the most and so that will set you
00:55 - up kind of for that core functionality
00:57 - that you can leverage for or any version
01:00 - of xcode we're going to start by
01:02 - creating a new xcode
01:05 - project and I'm not going to touch in
01:08 - too much detail all of the different
01:10 - project types or settings uh in this
01:13 - video in the next one we will actually
01:14 - create a new project and we'll go
01:16 - through the settings but for this one I
01:18 - just kind of want to whip up a new
01:19 - project I picked single View application
01:22 - there I'm just going
01:24 - to because the main point is I want to
01:27 - get to the interface so I can show you
01:29 - guys the different section s of the
01:32 - program so the first thing you'll notice
01:35 - on the left hand side you can see that
01:37 - it's split up into kind of three
01:39 - distinct sections so you have this left
01:41 - pane over here you have this big middle
01:45 - section then you have another column on
01:48 - the right hand side and then you have
01:50 - this gray strip across the top with some
01:53 - buttons and a status let's go over the
01:56 - left hand side first because this is
01:58 - where your project file Navigator is
02:01 - when you create a new app project it
02:03 - consists of a whole bunch of folders and
02:05 - files and so this is where you can uh
02:08 - look at the various files of your
02:10 - project not only that though this paint
02:12 - actually has a couple of different tabs
02:14 - which you won't need to know right
02:17 - now by far on this side of the screen
02:21 - you'll be looking at your file
02:24 - Navigator when you click on a file let's
02:27 - say this viewcontroller do switch
02:32 - the middle section changes and this is
02:34 - the code editor section actually
02:36 - depending on what kind of file you
02:38 - select if it's a code file you're going
02:40 - to see your lines of code here and
02:42 - you're going to be able to write your
02:43 - code and edit your code
02:45 - here if you're selecting
02:49 - however one of these interface files
02:53 - this area changes into interface Builder
02:56 - and you're going to be working visually
02:59 - to build your your
03:01 - interface okay so what about this right
03:04 - hand side over here so let's go back to
03:07 - a code file viewcontroller.swift and you
03:10 - can see here on the rightmost
03:13 - pane there's a couple of tabs as well
03:16 - and this is called the inspector pane so
03:20 - here it gives you details about the file
03:22 - that you have highlighted or the file
03:24 - that you're currently looking at the
03:25 - inspector pane is actually split into
03:27 - two different panes one taking up
03:30 - probably
03:31 - 75% at the top this is the inspector
03:34 - pane the bottom is called the library
03:37 - Pane and again this has a couple of tabs
03:40 - so just going back to the storyboard
03:44 - file you can see that on the library
03:47 - pane down here it shows me a bunch of
03:49 - different elements that I can add to my
03:52 - interface so you'll see in the in the
03:55 - next video when we're building our
03:57 - interface we're literally dragging and
03:58 - dropping elements from there
04:00 - and if we select an element so let's do
04:04 - let's do a quick I'll show you going
04:07 - drag a button on here and then when you
04:10 - tap on this and you look on the right
04:12 - hand side here you flip to the
04:15 - appropriate tab the attributes tab
04:18 - you're going to be looking at all the
04:19 - attributes for your button so that's
04:22 - what this right hand pane is useful for
04:26 - as well when you're in a code file so so
04:29 - let's go back to viewcontroller.swift
04:31 - there's actually a hidden section down
04:35 - here let's see if we can just bring it
04:37 - up we'll go to view debug area show
04:41 - debug area and that's essentially what
04:44 - this part is called It's called The
04:46 - debug area which we will get to uh later
04:49 - on when we actually start building our
04:50 - app and this is the area where we'll be
04:52 - able to inspect our code we'll be able
04:55 - to see any errors error messages and
04:58 - we'll be able to keep track of uh
05:00 - different variables and stuff like that
05:01 - it's basically an area that's going to
05:02 - be very helpful for us when we start uh
05:05 - writing code and we start
05:06 - troubleshooting our code and things like
05:09 - that and then at the very top here this
05:13 - gray strip the most prominent thing
05:16 - you'll see is this play button well this
05:18 - play button will actually run your
05:19 - project in the simulator so I'm going to
05:21 - go ahead and just tap that so you can
05:24 - see what happens and now you can see the
05:27 - stop button is also highlighted so that
05:30 - will stop your project from running and
05:32 - return you back to the project for
05:35 - editing so there's my simulator that
05:38 - pops up and I've I alluded to this in
05:43 - the um first video and this simulator
05:47 - basically mimics an iPhone so you don't
05:49 - actually need a device to test your app
05:52 - in uh as soon as you click run your
05:54 - project in xcode it launches the
05:56 - simulator and it allows you to test your
05:58 - app
06:00 - so we'll get more into that in the
06:01 - future to stop your project you just
06:04 - have to go here and click the stop
06:06 - button there's a drop down here that
06:08 - lets you select what kind of simulator
06:10 - you want to run your project in so you
06:12 - can try out your app on different
06:15 - devices and there's also iOS device and
06:18 - this is used for when you actually have
06:20 - a device to test on then you'll be able
06:23 - to select this option to do so on this
06:26 - status bar
06:27 - here it tells you there any errors with
06:30 - your project if you run it among other
06:34 - things and on the right hand corner
06:37 - right here there's some buttons just for
06:39 - some different views so you can toggle
06:42 - you know if you need more space you can
06:44 - toggle the different areas like this so
06:48 - at its core that's pretty much what
06:50 - xcode is split into right here the file
06:54 - Navigator in the middle you have your
06:56 - code editor
06:58 - area and in your in the right hand side
07:01 - you have the inspector pane or inspector
07:03 - area on the bottom here you have the
07:05 - debug area and at the top here you have
07:08 - your status bar and that's kind of
07:11 - remained the core of xcode for the last
07:13 - few
07:14 - iterations so don't worry if it looks
07:17 - confusing to you just like with any
07:19 - other program or app the more you use it
07:22 - the more comfortable you'll feel in it
07:24 - and when we start building our apps and
07:26 - and developing apps we'll be using all
07:28 - of these section and then you'll really
07:31 - get familiar with all of this stuff now
07:34 - there are some finer nuances and
07:36 - shortcuts and stuff like that that you
07:37 - can do with xcode but I'm going to save
07:39 - those for another video later on when
07:41 - it's relevant and I don't want to
07:42 - overload you guys for now that does it
07:45 - for your tour of xcode in the next
07:47 - lesson we're actually going to explain a
07:50 - little more about the different files in
07:52 - the app project and we're going to build
07:55 - and run our first project

hello this is Chris and welcome to lesson three of how to make iPhone apps with no programming experience so in this lesson we're going to walk through do a little tutorial of xcode the program which you will be spending a lot of time in to build apps and every year or two apple rolls out a new version but not uh the changes there are changes between the different versions but it's not so drastic that you'll have to learn everything a new it's kind of like uh how Adobe rolls out new versions of Photoshop and each iteration has new features and stuff like that but at the core the core product is still there and you know if you know how to use one version you'll be pretty well versed in the next version so in this video we're going to go through the major sections of the xcode interface that you'll be using the most and so that will set you up kind of for that core functionality that you can leverage for or any version of xcode we're going to start by creating a new xcode project and I'm not going to touch in too much detail all of the different project types or settings uh in this video in the next one we will actually create a new project and we'll go through the settings but for this one I just kind of want to whip up a new project I picked single View application there I'm just going to because the main point is I want to get to the interface so I can show you guys the

you're going to see your lines of code here and you're going to be able to write your code and edit your code here if you're selecting however one of these interface files this area changes into

button on here and then when you tap on this and you look on the right hand side here you flip to the appropriate tab the attributes tab you're going to be looking at all the attributes for your button so that's what this right hand pane is useful for as well when you're in a code file so so let's go back to viewcontroller.swift there's actually a hidden section down here let's see if we can just bring it up we'll go to view debug area show debug area and that's essentially what this part is called It's called The debug area which we will get to uh later on when we actually start building our app and this is the area where we'll be able to inspect our code we'll be able to see any errors error messages and we'll be able to keep track of uh different variables and stuff like that it's basically an area that's going to be very helpful for us when we start uh writing code and we start troubleshooting our code and things like that and then at the very top here this gray strip the most
