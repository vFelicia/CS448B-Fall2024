00:12 - hey guys can you see me can you hear me
00:16 - let me know in the chat below just so we
00:19 - know things are working out and we'll
00:21 - get started in just a minute
00:38 - hey guys can you hear me and hopefully
00:44 - you guys can all see my screen as well
00:54 - I'm super excited today to start this
00:57 - livestream because we're actually going
01:01 - to start an app from start to finish and
01:03 - this is not planned out this is I
01:05 - haven't built this out before there are
01:07 - things that I haven't figured out myself
01:09 - I don't know if this app idea that I
01:12 - have exists so we're gonna go through
01:14 - all of those steps together but I just
01:17 - want to wait a couple more minutes for
01:19 - people to join and we'll get started
01:21 - hey guys hey Chris hey Musa Angela
01:26 - Prakash hey Musa you should actually be
01:38 - able to see my screen I just have a
01:41 - quick agenda on there you guys should
01:43 - all be able to see my screen right now
01:45 - if you can't try refreshing the page I
01:48 - don't know but I am sharing my screen
01:49 - right now I am optimal if you have
01:56 - Windows 10 you have a couple of options
01:57 - we actually have an article for PC users
02:01 - and kind of the options that they have
02:02 - so Adrienne will send that link all
02:06 - right so let's get started if you guys
02:07 - don't know me my name is Chris this is
02:11 - the first time you're on the channel
02:12 - welcome to code with Chris where we
02:13 - teach people how to build iOS apps
02:16 - basically Adrienne is manning the chat
02:20 - and so please be nice to him send in
02:24 - your questions one by one and don't
02:25 - break up your messages into multiple
02:27 - messages and that's gonna help him be
02:29 - able to make sure all your questions get
02:31 - answered but in this live stream I don't
02:34 - know if we'll have a Q&A time we might
02:37 - this is gonna run for an hour and I'm
02:40 - not really gonna be teaching so much as
02:43 - showing in this live stream because like
02:45 - I said this live stream we're gonna
02:47 - start by taking an app idea that I have
02:51 - explain what it is we're gonna look into
02:53 - the app store check out what sorts of
02:55 - apps are existing for this kind of idea
02:58 - maybe check their reviews to see if
03:01 - people complain about certain things
03:02 - we're gonna go through some features and
03:05 - requirements and again this is all from
03:07 - scratch so I haven't I don't have these
03:10 - listed out beforehand I haven't given it
03:12 - any thought so there's gonna be some
03:15 - audience participation right you're
03:17 - gonna be able to suggest features for me
03:19 - for this app we're going to discuss mmm
03:24 - sort of which features should make it
03:25 - into the first version of the app which
03:28 - feature should be like a later phase and
03:30 - I'll show you how I break things up so
03:32 - that mmm I aim to get the project
03:36 - complete and out the door
03:37 - rather than trying to get the whole
03:40 - thing polished and perfect right and
03:42 - super duper feature full before shipping
03:45 - it that's not the way that I think we
03:47 - should work but I'll explain all of that
03:49 - later and then I'll talk about some of
03:50 - the challenges that I foresee with
03:52 - building this app some of the things
03:55 - that I still need to figure out some of
03:57 - the things that I've already figured out
03:59 - like I've done in the past so it
04:01 - shouldn't be a roadblock for me and I
04:04 - think that even though I don't have
04:06 - everything figured out that's that's why
04:08 - I'm doing this so I think it'll be very
04:09 - helpful for you guys to see that
04:11 - building an app isn't like isn't always
04:14 - a smooth process right it's a bumpy road
04:15 - and even for someone like me who you
04:18 - know I was doing it professionally in IT
04:20 - consulting for like five years it's
04:23 - still there's still things to figure out
04:25 - because there's always new features in
04:27 - the SDK there's you know things like
04:30 - even things I've done in the past
04:31 - I don't remember sometimes right so I
04:34 - have to go back and nowadays Google is
04:37 - awesome
04:38 - and having this resource and having all
04:40 - of these people create all of this
04:42 - content for iOS development and then all
04:45 - of the documentation available online
04:47 - it's great like I know some of the
04:49 - people who have been in the tech
04:50 - industry for a while and back then
04:52 - before you know before the internet so
04:56 - widespread we would have to dig through
04:59 - text books and try hopefully try to find
05:03 - the solution to your problem
05:04 - by just flipping through pages of thick
05:07 - tech book tech textbooks and relying on
05:10 - more senior people in the company to
05:13 - perhaps have encountered that problem
05:15 - before and help you solve it but these
05:18 - days development I think has changed a
05:21 - lot where as you can use Google and find
05:24 - your answers hopefully within minutes oh
05:26 - really do utilize that and I am going
05:28 - off on a tangent so I'll stop talking
05:30 - about that but let's get started with
05:33 - unveiling my app idea for this big
05:37 - project and it's basically a Pomodoro
05:40 - timer so if you know if you know what
05:42 - that is there are a ton of Pomodoro
05:45 - timer apps in the App Store already I
05:47 - can tell you that right now and I'll
05:50 - explain what Pomodoro is in a second for
05:53 - those of you guys who don't know but my
05:56 - idea for a Pomodoro timer and it's not
05:58 - an original idea is to integrate social
06:02 - features into the Pomodoro timer so that
06:05 - you can connect with friends like you
06:09 - can add friends to your account and then
06:12 - you guys can see each other's like
06:15 - Pomodoro's how many Pomodoro you have
06:17 - completed during that day so you can
06:19 - motivate each other and can challenge
06:21 - each other to do more Pomodoro's now
06:24 - before I get too far ahead of myself for
06:27 - those of you guys who don't know what
06:28 - the Pomodoro Technique is let me just
06:31 - explain very very quickly and I actually
06:33 - found a graphic on on Google and it
06:37 - talks about it like really really
06:40 - succinctly a Pomodoro timer is basically
06:43 - a timer what so let me back up the
06:46 - Pomodoro Technique I don't even know who
06:50 - developed it but if you google it there
06:52 - was a guy who invented this technique
06:54 - but basically overall revolves around
06:56 - productivity and how to stay productive
07:00 - so the idea works like this you set a
07:03 - timer for 25 minutes and during those
07:05 - twenty five minutes you remove all
07:07 - distractions you just focus on that one
07:10 - thing that you're doing for 25 minutes
07:12 - your timer is going to go off at the end
07:15 - of 25 minutes at that point
07:16 - take a short break which is a
07:18 - five-minute break so for five minutes
07:20 - you just you know get up stretch
07:22 - whatever and then you do another
07:25 - Pomodoro for 25 minutes same task until
07:30 - you get it done so you keep repeating
07:33 - this process you know twenty-five
07:35 - minutes of work five minutes of break
07:36 - until you reach for Pomodoro so you've
07:38 - worked for a hundred minutes then you
07:41 - take a longer break and they recommend a
07:44 - 15-minute break I think for a long break
07:46 - but there is some flexibility and how
07:50 - you use the system so you can you know
07:53 - you can take a longer break as long as
07:55 - you want and then you get back to it so
07:57 - the idea is that a it helps you remove
08:00 - all distractions because your mind
08:02 - thinks oh for twenty-five minutes I just
08:04 - have to do this task for 25 minutes and
08:06 - it makes it easier to start right for
08:09 - something that you really really don't
08:10 - want to do and you're procrastinating if
08:12 - you just think I'm just gonna do 25
08:15 - minutes and then once you get into it
08:17 - you just obviously you do more and more
08:19 - until it's done
08:20 - number two it helps you estimate tasks
08:22 - because if you do that task a lot and
08:26 - you're setting your Pomodoro timers
08:29 - you'll be able to then better estimate
08:34 - how long like how many Pomodoro's that
08:37 - task will take and so you can break up
08:40 - your workday if you have like eight
08:41 - hours or six hours or whatever you can
08:43 - then gauge better how much work you can
08:47 - actually fit in so that's the whole idea
08:50 - of the Pomodoro Technique what I've been
08:52 - using myself is this website called
08:55 - tomato timer and it's like the most
08:58 - basic website you will ever find for
09:01 - this sort of thing but it works and
09:03 - that's why I use it so all you do is you
09:07 - hit start the timer goes for 25 minutes
09:09 - and when those 25 minutes are up it
09:11 - beeps and then you just stop it you
09:14 - reset it and then you go to this tab
09:16 - where it's going to give you a
09:17 - five-minute break then you take your
09:19 - 5-minute break and you go back to the
09:20 - Pomodoro for 25 minutes and after you've
09:22 - done four of them you take a long break
09:24 - so personally when I use this Pomodoro
09:27 - Technique to try to stay productive
09:28 - I don't keep track of how many
09:30 - Pomodoro's I've done I mostly use this
09:35 - as a way to remove distraction because
09:40 - in my mind I'm like I just have to focus
09:42 - for twenty five minutes and also as a
09:45 - motivator to do things that I don't
09:47 - really want to do and if I didn't have
09:49 - anything like this I would just put off
09:51 - those things continuously so I think we
09:53 - all have tasks like that so personally I
09:58 - find this very useful and I know there
10:00 - are apps out there there's like a ton of
10:02 - apps in the App Store for this sort of
10:04 - simple time work but I don't think there
10:06 - is one which has these social features
10:09 - integrated where you can kind of chair
10:11 - each other on and be like oh how many
10:13 - palma doors that you do how many did i
10:14 - do and then just help each other stay
10:16 - productive and again this is not my
10:20 - original idea I was reading a blog post
10:22 - from it was on search engine
10:25 - optimization and this guy he uses
10:27 - Pomodoro timers religiously and one way
10:31 - that he stays so productive is that he
10:34 - he has a partner which he works with and
10:37 - they chat through the messages app and
10:40 - they basically they just tell each other
10:42 - how many Pomodoro's they did and it kind
10:45 - of because they have a competitive
10:46 - nature they kind of spur each other on
10:48 - to do more and so he was he was saying
10:51 - like he can't find anything out there
10:53 - for this sort of social twist to the
10:58 - Pomodoro Technique and if someone were
11:00 - to create it then he would be the first
11:02 - to use it and so that kind of gave me
11:03 - the idea and I think it it would be
11:05 - useful like even if no one paid me any
11:07 - money to do it I think I would use it so
11:11 - that's that's kind of my motivation I'm
11:13 - not doing this for money or anything and
11:16 - I thought that this would be also a
11:18 - great project to share with you guys to
11:21 - go on this journey and take this idea or
11:24 - I build it out submit it to the app
11:26 - store build like a website for it just
11:30 - basically go through the whole thing and
11:31 - you guys can experience all of the ups
11:33 - and downs and the roadblocks and the
11:35 - challenges and I think that's what some
11:37 - of you guys said that you wanted to see
11:39 - and I thought it was a really good idea
11:41 - actually
11:42 - with that because there are a ton of iOS
11:44 - tutorials out there right but what's the
11:46 - problem with all of this knowledge it's
11:49 - that it relies on the reader or the
11:51 - watch or the viewer right to take that
11:53 - knowledge and turn it into practice
11:56 - right be practical with it because just
12:00 - consuming content just reading just
12:02 - watching it doesn't help you get
12:04 - anything done and unless you turn that
12:06 - knowledge into wisdom through doing the
12:10 - work right that's that's the point where
12:14 - that knowledge actually gives you
12:16 - dividends and gives you like a return on
12:20 - return on investment yeah
12:23 - so hopefully this candid real journey of
12:28 - me building this app and showing you
12:32 - guys all of the steps and processes
12:34 - helps you guys understand what it's
12:37 - really like
12:38 - all right behind the curtains and
12:39 - hopefully it inspires you guys to start
12:41 - now in the beginning of next month in
12:46 - the beginning of November I'll be it's
12:49 - kind of not hosting but I'll be starting
12:51 - like a challenge like an app challenge
12:53 - and I think I've talked about this in
12:55 - the previous livestream where I want to
12:57 - get as many people who feel comfortable
12:59 - building apps no matter how simple they
13:00 - are to be involved and the goal is to
13:04 - try to build and ship an app within a
13:06 - month and I think that's completely
13:07 - doable as long as your scope isn't like
13:09 - out to space right if you pick something
13:11 - that's gonna be doable for your skill
13:13 - level I think that's totally doable and
13:15 - I think the point is not to make money
13:19 - or not to you know not to do anything
13:21 - like that the point is to get into the
13:23 - practice of actually producing stuff
13:25 - actually putting into practice what
13:27 - you're learning and actually shipping
13:29 - products because I think you know
13:33 - there's this there's this sort of danger
13:35 - of always tweaking something and trying
13:38 - to get it perfect or always just working
13:39 - on designs and prototypes and
13:41 - daydreaming about stuff right that's not
13:45 - until you actually ship something and
13:46 - maybe get some feedback on it that we're
13:48 - we're you know that you're either onto
13:51 - something or maybe you should close the
13:55 - door on that
13:55 - so got that's gonna be the challenge
13:58 - starting November 1st and for those of
14:00 - you guys who aren't at the skill level
14:02 - where you feel like you can build
14:03 - anything yet
14:04 - I'll have another learning path for you
14:06 - guys to take for the next 28 days where
14:09 - you can get yourself up to speed so
14:11 - that's all coming up and really excited
14:13 - about that but anyways now that we have
14:15 - the intro out of the way let's get
14:17 - started with the next part which is uh
14:20 - so I've told you about my app idea the
14:23 - next part I wanted to do with you guys
14:24 - it's actually just check out the App
14:25 - Store now I've downloaded a couple of
14:28 - the Pomodoro timers by couple I actually
14:30 - mean two and one I found really
14:33 - confusing to use I feel like a timer
14:35 - should just when you launch it you
14:38 - should be able to just see a start
14:39 - button and start it but some of these
14:41 - are actually the way that they've done
14:43 - the user interface is actually a little
14:45 - bit confusing so what I'm gonna do is
14:47 - I'm gonna plug in my phone and hopefully
14:49 - I can show it on the screen we're gonna
14:50 - check out the app store see what's
14:52 - available and hopefully I don't see a
14:54 - Pomodoro timer which already has the
14:56 - social features included because as I
14:59 - didn't look very hard and as far as I
15:02 - know it doesn't exist so we're gonna
15:04 - check that out let me plug in my phone
15:05 - right here alright so hopefully you guys
15:13 - can see my phone see it on the screen
15:16 - right now
15:23 - okay so in case you guys were wondering
15:27 - the app is not going to be submitted to
15:29 - the App Store today
15:30 - right today we are starting the journey
15:32 - to do this so I think by the end of this
15:35 - livestream we will have a list of
15:38 - requirements flushed out the bare
15:43 - minimum requirements to submit to the
15:45 - App Store as an MVP or Minimum Viable
15:46 - Product and I'll be able to tell you
15:50 - guys about what my next steps are in
15:52 - terms of figuring out some of the
15:53 - challenges that are gonna exist for me
15:57 - all right so I'm looking in the App
15:59 - Store here I'm gonna do a search for I'm
16:08 - just gonna search for the more general
16:09 - term just to see what comes up so focus
16:13 - keeper is one which I actually
16:16 - downloaded and this is the one which I'm
16:19 - currently using the nice thing about
16:20 - this one is that it has all of these
16:23 - nice graphs and I really like the idea
16:26 - of it logging how many Pomodoro's you've
16:30 - done and being able to see over time the
16:33 - work that you've done because that's one
16:35 - thing that I'm not doing right now I
16:36 - just use the timer I turn it I time it
16:39 - and I stop it and I just use that tomato
16:42 - timer I showed you doesn't keep track of
16:43 - any history so just by using the app
16:46 - which I've been using this one for the
16:48 - last maybe a couple of days it's nice to
16:51 - be able to keep track of that so this
16:55 - one is pretty easy to use right it's got
16:58 - a start start and a stop but this one
17:00 - doesn't have any of the social features
17:01 - which which I'm targeting and that has
17:04 - some pretty good rating so what I would
17:09 - do is probably take a look at some of
17:12 - the reviews and see what people do like
17:13 - about it and hopefully try to emulate
17:15 - some of those features into the app that
17:18 - we're building right now
17:22 - so there's that
17:31 - yeah this is another kind of like
17:34 - version I guess of a Pomodoro timer but
17:37 - it's not it's not really based off of
17:38 - the Pomodoro Technique for timers like
17:40 - this it's basically like you set the
17:44 - time that you want to work and if you
17:46 - take your phone and try to do something
17:48 - else with it like go on Facebook or
17:50 - whatever then the tree that you're
17:52 - growing is gonna die so the motivation
17:54 - is to stay focused is to not kill your
17:58 - tree so I want to consider this to be a
18:01 - Pomodoro timer it's a Productivity tool
18:04 - but the Pomodoro timer and this one here
18:10 - this one's just in Chinese it's not
18:14 - really my target market but I think it
18:16 - looks like at a bare minimum you've got
18:19 - the timers and then you've got charts
18:21 - right to keep track of how much you've
18:24 - worked which definitely we we should
18:28 - have
18:38 - and some of these some of these as well
18:42 - they're not just Pomodoro timers they're
18:45 - also like to-do lists and there are gold
18:47 - trackers and stuff like that and
18:49 - personally this is my personal opinion I
18:51 - feel like if your app tries to do too
18:55 - much it's gonna be convoluted and it's
18:59 - gonna be more confusing to use and so
19:01 - when I built this Pomodoro timer app
19:03 - it's purely going to be for the Pomodoro
19:06 - Technique and I'm not gonna try to put
19:09 - to-do lists or goals or anything like
19:11 - that and then we're gonna have the
19:13 - social aspect all based around the
19:15 - Pomodoro that you complete
19:25 - see this one has habit training and mono
19:29 - tasking I wouldn't call this like a pure
19:33 - Pomodoro Technique either
19:42 - based on the Pomodoro Technique yeah
19:45 - make a to-do list now
19:55 - Rustom how to quit learning how to quit
19:59 - the learning regimen and start doing
20:00 - your own project so you you just got
20:04 - that you just got to start but I know it
20:07 - can be confusing as to where to start
20:09 - and so I do have a learning plan that
20:13 - I'm going to come up with starting
20:15 - November 1st that's gonna be free for
20:17 - everyone to use and it's gonna basically
20:18 - be like day one you do that stay tuned
20:20 - you do this and you just follow that and
20:21 - hopefully that motivates you guys to
20:23 - actually do stuff rather than just
20:25 - continually learning because I know it
20:26 - can be tempting to just watch like ten
20:28 - videos and then you know back-to-back
20:31 - like a Netflix binging session but
20:33 - that's not really helpful creative
20:38 - rewarding daily have a routine you know
20:40 - what I don't see anything yeah okay this
20:43 - was the other one that I've used flat
20:44 - tomato I downloaded this one I found it
20:47 - really hard to use I didn't didn't
20:50 - really understand because the the
20:52 - interface was so minimal that when I
20:55 - launched it I saw this clock face but
20:58 - there were no like buttons to tell me
21:00 - what to press or what actions to take
21:03 - and I found it really confusing to use
21:07 - but it still got has pretty good rating
21:10 - so maybe I'm just dumb
21:15 - yeah all right so I'm kind of focus I'm
21:20 - sorry I'm kind of satisfied to me yeah
21:29 - see they're a ton of these things but I
21:31 - don't think any of them have had this
21:35 - the sort of social feature it's all very
21:38 - like focused on your own to do the next
21:47 - thing to do I'm not going to do with
21:50 - this right here because it's it's a
21:51 - little mind-numbing but it would be to
21:54 - go through some of the reviews for these
21:56 - apps and kind of see what people are
21:58 - saying about the app what did they like
22:00 - about it what do they don't like about
22:02 - it and that sort of knowledge will sort
22:07 - of guide you into what sorts of features
22:08 - that you should implement into your own
22:11 - app or maybe how to design the user
22:15 - interface of your app like if if a
22:19 - particular app has really good reviews I
22:21 - would suggest you download it and play
22:23 - around with it and see kind of how they
22:25 - did their UI and I want to say copy it
22:29 - but I would say let it guide you and
22:32 - your design when you're designing your
22:35 - own up and so I'm gonna I'm gonna move
22:38 - on now to writing out our own feature
22:41 - set for our app right here I'm just
22:46 - gonna minimize that and we're just gonna
22:49 - do this right here so I will just write
22:53 - it right here features and requirements
22:56 - see if you guys can see this on the
22:58 - screen
23:02 - all right so I would say and I'm gonna
23:07 - break this right right now into like a
23:11 - v1 youtube because I'm gonna tell you
23:15 - right now my v1 is going to be super
23:17 - simple because if you've seen my video
23:25 - right here which I released recently
23:28 - called finish your projects or five tips
23:31 - to help you complete your projects I
23:33 - recommend that you should take your
23:37 - overall feature set and break it down
23:39 - into an MVP that is manageable so what
23:42 - what is the minimum amount of core
23:45 - features your app needs to have to still
23:48 - be useful and so that's what I'm going
23:52 - to base it on to me
23:53 - this tomato timer on this website this
23:56 - is like the bare minimum I think that
23:58 - you need in order to follow the Pomodoro
24:00 - Technique so there's like no history
24:03 - there's no tracking there's no social
24:05 - features there's no charts nothing and
24:07 - so I'm gonna base my v1 off of something
24:10 - like this where you you literally just
24:13 - have three timers start and stop and
24:16 - reset and you know that that is
24:19 - literally it so my v1 is going to be
24:24 - something like we have the 25 minute
24:29 - timer right we have the five minute
24:34 - break timer and we have the long 15
24:38 - minute fifteen minute long break timer
24:43 - and I think in order for it to be useful
24:46 - as well as a Pomodoro timer is if like
24:52 - let's say you get a phone call or
24:53 - something pops up in your app and if
24:56 - you're really sticking to your Pomodoro
24:58 - Technique you're not supposed to be
25:00 - distracted by any of that but let's just
25:02 - say if you do and this app goes into the
25:05 - background I feel like it should still
25:07 - be tracking the time right so that it
25:10 - doesn't like pause the timer when your
25:12 - app goes into the background so I feel
25:14 - like
25:15 - as even as a v1 the app needs to keep or
25:20 - how about let's just say timer needs to
25:23 - continue to run in the background like
25:26 - if you've had if you have that timer set
25:28 - so that's one of the things that I
25:30 - actually don't know how to do but I know
25:32 - it can be done because obviously it can
25:35 - because everyone has these Pomodoro
25:37 - timer apps out there I just need to
25:39 - figure out how to do it and I'm sure
25:41 - it's not very hard because in order to
25:44 - run things in the background I do know
25:45 - that you need to enable certain
25:47 - capabilities for your app so I think it
25:50 - it's just that I think it's just
25:54 - specifying that your app needs to run
25:55 - timers or maybe schedule the reminder or
25:58 - something like that I just need to
26:00 - investigate that so that's one of the
26:01 - challenges but I'll get into that
26:14 - let me see if you guys have any
26:16 - suggestions okay so if you guys do have
26:24 - suggestions type it in now I am keeping
26:27 - track of the chat now
26:28 - so I mean just two future so I don't
26:34 - have to organize those but definitely
26:35 - social features right we're talking
26:37 - about ability for users to create an
26:41 - account also abilities ability for a
26:48 - user to use it as a guest so if people
26:53 - want to use the timer and not create an
26:55 - account and just use the app without the
26:57 - social features out I do want to allow
26:59 - that as well
27:01 - so there or let's say let's break this
27:03 - up into social features timer features
27:13 - so for this would be like ability to set
27:17 - or to customize the durations of breaks
27:23 - or work timers see what you guys are
27:27 - saying ability to set targets Martin
27:32 - maybe you can expand on what you mean by
27:34 - targets do you mean ah so you mean like
27:37 - a goal for how many Pomodoro's you're
27:39 - gonna do that date integration into
27:44 - messages maybe Kevin you can expand on
27:48 - that like in what way would would it
27:51 - integrate into the messages app like
27:53 - would you share your progress with
27:56 - someone through messages that what
27:57 - you're talking about
27:58 - okay Martin we yeah I'm gonna write that
28:00 - down so this would be like goal setting
28:07 - ability to set a daily goal for the
28:14 - amount of palms mom's the palms you're
28:19 - going to do call this sharing I have to
28:26 - merge some of this actually sharing we
28:28 - probably go into social ability to share
28:33 - your progress with others so this would
28:38 - be kind of like a share extension type
28:41 - of thing so that you can share it with
28:42 - messages or whatsapp or anything like
28:46 - that let me just type out some more of
28:48 - these ability for user to follow follow
28:53 - let's follow the right word or add as to
28:57 - add friends ability to like we would
29:02 - need user profiles right so that you can
29:03 - see how many Pomodoro's your friend is
29:06 - doing or something like that Billy to to
29:11 - view user profiles I think what would be
29:15 - very cool is like if you could issue
29:17 - challenges right like if you can have a
29:19 - running challenge with another person or
29:21 - maybe a group of people where you set
29:24 - you set a goal like oh every day you
29:26 - have to do like the goal everyone agrees
29:30 - on is like every day you have to do ten
29:31 - Pomodoro's or something and then whoever
29:34 - doesn't do it gets like kicked out of
29:36 - the group or dropped out and then like
29:38 - you can see who's left standing like
29:40 - king of the hill styles I don't know
29:42 - that's just an idea but I'm gonna write
29:43 - it down ability to issue challenges with
29:48 - a single person or group and we can
29:52 - elaborate on that needs more detail
29:57 - see what you guys are saying yeah Martin
30:05 - I agree yeah I agree with sending daily
30:08 - weekly targets I just don't want to get
30:12 - too far out there that this turns into
30:17 - kind of like a habit tracker as well
30:19 - because I want to stay really focused
30:21 - that this is just like a very strict
30:26 - Pomodoro timer but I might you know I
30:29 - might change my mind on that that's the
30:31 - way I feel right now but see this is the
30:34 - this is why we do an MVP right so we're
30:37 - gonna release the v1 it's a simple timer
30:39 - v2 we might add some of the social
30:41 - features and then depending on what
30:43 - people start saying if people start
30:44 - using this and saying like oh I wish I
30:46 - had this I wish I had that then we're
30:47 - gonna have to start evaluating what's
30:50 - best for the users because you do want
30:53 - to the idea is to iterate on this idea
30:56 - in this product to turn it into
30:58 - something that people love using oh I
31:05 - know now you're saying the long break is
31:07 - 30 minutes yeah I have to verify I have
31:09 - to verify that it might be 30 minutes
31:11 - you might be completely right I don't
31:13 - I'm not so sure if it might be 15
31:15 - minutes or not I'm just gonna say like X
31:18 - minute like what is the the long break
31:23 - that the Pomodoro Technique actually
31:25 - recommends I don't for me personally I I
31:28 - just take like X number of minutes I
31:31 - don't keep track of how long my break is
31:32 - I go off and do something and whenever
31:34 - I'm done taking a break I just come back
31:37 - and start another cycle of for
31:39 - Pomodoro's oh I don't really like that I
31:45 - really like the the messages like keep
31:48 - going the encouragement right
31:51 - Martin so the user profile is not going
31:54 - to be not not social profile it's gonna
31:58 - be like how many Pomodoro's have that
32:00 - has this guy done today and in you know
32:04 - in the last week or something like that
32:06 - so the idea is to keep each other come
32:09 - to stay productive and to to be doing
32:12 - work I'm gonna put Iona I'm gonna put
32:18 - your feature under goal setting so
32:21 - encouragement quotes
32:34 - yeah happy images
32:44 - so I've kind of decided that this is
32:47 - gonna be like v1 we can probably crank
32:49 - this out pretty quickly because I do
32:51 - like my goal is gonna be try to try to
32:54 - release this v1 by the end of the month
32:56 - so that when we start the app challenge
32:59 - on November 1st I can be ready to do
33:02 - like a phase 2 version of the app and
33:04 - I'm gonna use that as my month-long app
33:06 - challenge so I'm gonna keep v1 really
33:10 - simple and probably not very useful to
33:14 - be honest compared to all of the other
33:16 - Pomodoro timers out there but I don't
33:18 - really care I'm just gonna because I
33:21 - think mentally just getting it shipped
33:24 - getting it released in the App Store
33:26 - is a milestone in my head and that's
33:30 - gonna keep me motivated to do v2 right I
33:35 - think when we're talking about
33:36 - motivation like I run into the same
33:39 - problems as you guys do if if any of you
33:41 - guys suffer from that like I said before
33:45 - I have tons of half-done projects in a
33:48 - folder somewhere on my computer and I'm
33:52 - really scared to to publicly now right
33:54 - I'm doing this with you guys to cut the
33:58 - cord on this I don't really want to do
34:00 - that so I'm gonna set v1 to be very
34:03 - manageable to be something like I'm
34:05 - pretty confident like 99% that I can get
34:07 - this done and shipped and then we are
34:10 - going to improve on that from there so
34:15 - I'm I'm following my own advice guys in
34:18 - the five tips on how to finish your
34:20 - project follow my own advice here social
34:24 - features so you know I don't know if we
34:28 - have to decide on a v2 right now but I
34:30 - feel like if you two might be to be able
34:33 - to set durations like that seems pretty
34:38 - pretty necessary because everyone uses
34:41 - plummet or a little differently some
34:43 - people take longer breaks some people
34:44 - not and the social aspect like
34:47 - integrating the ability to create an
34:50 - account
34:50 - - like even even having to create an
34:55 - account requires a back-end so at this
34:58 - point we're getting into databases right
35:00 - and so that's compared to everything
35:04 - else that's a large part of work so it
35:10 - would be you also it would be useless to
35:13 - introduce the ability to create an
35:14 - account but that's it right oh I forgot
35:22 - so let me finish that train of thought
35:24 - so it would be useless to be able to
35:25 - create an account but not do anything
35:27 - with it so if we were to introduce this
35:30 - the ability to create an account we
35:31 - would have to also introduce the ability
35:35 - to like add friends and follow friends
35:37 - and maybe like like there you know maybe
35:41 - give them a thumbs up when they've
35:42 - completed a Pomodoro or something like
35:44 - that but I was about to say that we
35:47 - forgot a huge piece here and that would
35:49 - be like history I don't know if that's
35:56 - the right word but basically like
35:57 - tracking how much work you've done like
36:01 - keeping track of poems completed every
36:10 - day
36:13 - showing them in a graph oh I don't know
36:21 - why I'm capitalizing some of these
36:23 - ability to change date range on the
36:32 - graph so stuff like that like ability to
36:34 - manipulate the graph so that you can see
36:37 - how many you how many maybe Pomodoro's
36:42 - you've done in the last month versus the
36:44 - last week versus the last three days or
36:46 - whatever like that and maybe to be able
36:47 - to average it out so this definitely
36:50 - neat it needs more detail needs more
36:52 - thought around it but see doing this
36:57 - stuff doesn't require user accounts
36:59 - either so we can keep track of this data
37:06 - locally on their device right when they
37:09 - do create an account though we could
37:11 - with her sync that data somewhere so
37:14 - that if they logged in to that same
37:15 - account on another device or maybe
37:17 - they're using two devices at once or
37:19 - maybe in the future would create like a
37:20 - Mac app version of this app as well then
37:23 - the data can get synced into that same
37:25 - account so you know data syncing I
37:35 - actually don't know if this has an H or
37:37 - not I look right
37:42 - all right data syncing so ability to
37:49 - transfer data to another device or keep
37:55 - data in sync with another device let's
38:02 - see what you guys are saying right here
38:11 - oh you have tons of half-done online
38:15 - courses same with me
38:17 - same with me it's you know like life
38:19 - happens things come up it's tough it's
38:22 - tough in a hair Here I am like I'm I
38:27 - have online courses right hate for
38:29 - people so like first hand I know how
38:31 - hard it is to to make time for this
38:34 - stuff yeah I own a thumb I don't want
38:41 - this app to have to be connected to the
38:43 - Internet to work because it shouldn't
38:46 - right just only for the social features
38:49 - it would be yeah Kevin you're right so
38:56 - Kevin says the ability to categorize the
38:59 - palms that you work on whether that's
39:00 - for like school or work or maybe another
39:03 - cat look Billy Billy to set categories
39:05 - so that when you're looking at your
39:07 - history you can see how much work you've
39:10 - done in each category I think that that
39:13 - kind of goes with goal setting I think
39:15 - no timer features I put this under here
39:18 - ability to choose a category for the
39:24 - palm you're running
39:33 - and filter based on category
39:55 - Sofer Khan I'm sorry if I am butchering
40:00 - your name but he's saying the
40:02 - integration with github or bitbucket to
40:04 - buy in the palm with a repository to
40:06 - track how many hours of code in the repo
40:08 - that's interesting that's interesting
40:13 - just get help a bit okay track hours
40:17 - like that I'm actually not familiar with
40:18 - that but I'm gonna write it down I just
40:25 - could make a Miska category with I just
40:32 - say source control so just for us well
40:41 - the social feature work with teams like
40:43 - setting a timer for an entire team I've
40:46 - actually seen that done with this app
40:48 - called a forest which is a Productivity
40:51 - app that revolves around timers as well
40:53 - and I think they've just released a
40:56 - feature or maybe it's not recent but I
40:59 - recently discovered that they have a
41:01 - feature where you can like put your
41:02 - phones together and sync up a timer so
41:05 - like you said if coworkers are working
41:07 - together they have like a group timer
41:11 - and if anyone picks up their phone I
41:13 - think it kills it kills the tree or
41:15 - whatever they're trying to grow for for
41:18 - the whole team so it keeps the whole
41:20 - team focused but to answer your question
41:26 - just for I haven't I haven't thought
41:28 - about it whether it will work together
41:31 - as a team I'm gonna write that down
41:35 - but in my head right now
41:38 - I don't have any I don't have any I
41:43 - haven't thought about doing that
41:46 - so I'm gonna write that down
42:18 - okay let's build a million-dollar
42:23 - Pomodoro app you know what I haven't
42:27 - even thought about monetization I don't
42:29 - like I said my goal isn't to to make
42:32 - money from the app I honestly would just
42:37 - like to use it and I think that's the
42:39 - best motivation although it's kind of
42:44 - idealistic because people need money to
42:46 - survive so if we were to to charge money
42:49 - for it I don't know we could try
42:50 - different forms of monetization now that
42:52 - would be an interesting experiment
42:54 - experiment I think we should do it we
42:57 - should try like just because we're
43:00 - building this together I think you guys
43:01 - would all be interested to see like how
43:03 - much potential you know money we could
43:07 - make off of often releasing an app and
43:09 - monetizing it too right so there are so
43:13 - many different ways to monetize it but
43:15 - like one one way that comes to mind
43:19 - right now would be to be like have a
43:22 - banner with an in-app purchase to remove
43:25 - it let's say for pro version and then
43:28 - like you see apps telling people they
43:32 - could use it for free right but then pro
43:34 - version unlocks maybe like the history
43:37 - version aspect of it or anything else I
43:40 - do believe we cannot put the social
43:42 - features behind a paywall because that's
43:45 - kind of what is the differentiator for
43:47 - this app right without the social
43:50 - features then how is this any different
43:52 - from any of the other Pomodoro timers
43:55 - out there in the app store right now
43:57 - right I wouldn't say any
44:05 - yeah so I'm gonna have to take some time
44:07 - away to take a look at these features
44:10 - which we've talked about and come up
44:11 - with a v2 but I don't think I have to do
44:14 - that until closer to the end of the
44:16 - month I'm gonna focus on doing this part
44:19 - v1 which is pretty doable the only thing
44:22 - I need to figure out right is is this
44:24 - timer in the background and the next
44:26 - time I talk to you guys I'm gonna make
44:28 - it a goal to have figured that out so I
44:30 - can tell you guys what I had to do but
44:36 - the next steps
44:37 - traditionally let me bring up another
44:41 - video that I've done that's this one
44:44 - called the app design process and that
44:47 - basically just runs through the
44:50 - different steps typically taken in
44:53 - building an app so we have now completed
44:57 - like the first step which is basically
45:00 - to gather the requirements for the app
45:02 - and figure out the core MVP version the
45:07 - next step would be to wireframe it out
45:11 - so that you can design kind of like the
45:14 - UI for the for the app and then it would
45:19 - be designed and then it would be
45:20 - development and then integrating the
45:22 - design testing it and releasing it so me
45:25 - coming from as a developer the thing
45:29 - that I like to do all the time is I like
45:32 - to figure out all of the technical
45:34 - challenges first a guy I like to make
45:37 - sure that I can actually do all of these
45:40 - things before starting on the UI and the
45:43 - design and stuff like that because I
45:49 - feel like there's no point in designing
45:51 - an element or a feature if when it comes
45:56 - down to it I can't achieve it
45:58 - technically right so there's nothing
46:05 - here that
46:08 - like the this I told you guys I don't
46:11 - know how to do right now but I know it
46:13 - can be done so I'm not that worried
46:15 - about having to completely figure that
46:18 - out first right so in the next video in
46:23 - this sort of how to make an app from
46:24 - scratch series I'll be mocking up the
46:28 - screens for this version now I'm not
46:31 - gonna go ahead and wireframe all of the
46:34 - screens for like all of these features
46:35 - because we haven't really figured out
46:37 - exactly which features are gonna make
46:39 - the cut and in what order what I'm gonna
46:43 - be focused on is the timer screen
46:46 - because that's really the screen that
46:47 - people are gonna be spending the most
46:48 - time on right and I think that screen
46:52 - has a lot it has a huge impact on
46:55 - whether that person will use the app or
46:58 - not and this is based on my experience I
46:59 - told you guys I downloaded two Pomodoro
47:01 - apps I launched the first one I tapped
47:04 - on the timer it was confusing I started
47:07 - it and I didn't know how to stop the
47:09 - timer or pause the timer and like I was
47:11 - just trying to figure out how to use it
47:12 - and I just gave up and I just like
47:14 - closed the app and then launched the
47:15 - other one and simply for the fact that I
47:19 - it was easy for me to figure out how to
47:22 - start and stop that timer I ended up
47:24 - sticking with that app and using that up
47:26 - so that's why it's so important for for
47:31 - the UI at some of the other Pomodoro
47:34 - apps out there like I told you reading
47:36 - their reviews especially for the highly
47:38 - rated ones taking a look at maybe I can
47:43 - find a commonality in the UI for all of
47:46 - the highly rated ones that I'm gonna
47:48 - take those considerations into my own
47:51 - design process when I'm like wireframing
47:54 - that up so I'm gonna do that work
47:58 - offline however in the next video I am
48:01 - going to recreate the wireframe with you
48:06 - guys if if I've already done that so
48:09 - that I can show you guys how to use the
48:12 - graphic design tools to create a
48:15 - wireframe I'm not gonna just show up and
48:17 - be like hey guys I created the wireframe
48:19 - here you go
48:20 - this is then you guys want wouldn't be
48:22 - able to do that for your own apps right
48:24 - so in the next video or a livestream
48:28 - whatever it might be I will show you
48:32 - guys how to navigate around a graphics
48:35 - design tool and how to create some
48:37 - wireframes I'm in that tool and I will
48:42 - have figured out what my UI will look
48:43 - like so we'll build that wireframe of
48:47 - that v1 version together in that
48:49 - graphics tool and then from there
48:53 - all right well we'll build it out which
48:56 - is like I'm looking at it it's a pretty
48:59 - simple app and then we're gonna launch
49:02 - it together in the app store so you're
49:05 - gonna get to see you know the things
49:07 - that you're gonna be testing the things
49:10 - that the assets that you'll need will
49:13 - create the app icon launch screen and
49:15 - stuff like that and we'll publish it
49:17 - together and then starting in November
49:20 - when we're gonna when I'm gonna run that
49:22 - challenge we'll take a look at v2 for
49:24 - the app and yeah so hopefully you guys
49:27 - stick around and now we've got about 12
49:31 - more minutes I'm gonna take a look at
49:32 - what sort of questions you guys have if
49:34 - you have any questions oh sorry about
49:36 - that I will talk louder and into my mic
49:41 - I should move this mic sorry if you guys
49:43 - had trouble hearing me just now but let
49:46 - me take a look at your chat let's see if
49:50 - you guys have any questions for me
49:55 - well the November challenge have a have
49:57 - a theme do you think you guys would want
50:00 - a theme I don't want to restrict you
50:01 - guys to to building something so maybe
50:04 - maybe I could think of a theme that you
50:07 - can follow or not see yes this is how
50:10 - this is gonna be the first time that I'm
50:12 - doing this it might be a free-for-all
50:14 - this time because my ultimate goal is
50:17 - just to get people to do things right to
50:19 - get people off of their butt and to
50:21 - actually do something so I haven't yet
50:24 - formalized like what's sort of prizes or
50:27 - recognition there might be and there
50:29 - will be recognition for sure prizes for
50:33 - this first one I'm not
50:35 - but it I do plan for it to be a monthly
50:37 - thing and I want to just motivate people
50:40 - to to get off their butt to do stuff so
50:47 - if you guys have any questions for me
50:48 - just type it into the chat right now I'm
50:50 - just going through the chat mm-hmm Iona
50:57 - I missed this the speaker idea that you
51:00 - had which is changing the music or the
51:02 - alarm that sounds depending on the
51:05 - project you're working or maybe having
51:06 - an ability to customize that mm-hmm
51:10 - that's kind of cool women right write
51:11 - that down right here
51:32 - just for we use the Pomodoro Technique
51:34 - while developing your Pomodoro up you
51:38 - have my chest my chest
51:44 - maybe you guys let me know like how many
51:46 - of you guys have actually heard of about
51:48 - the Pomodoro Technique before and how
51:51 - many of you guys actually use it
51:52 - yourself
51:53 - I'd be interesting to hear because I
51:56 - think it's a pretty well-known technique
52:00 - Nelson thank you thank you for your
52:02 - compliment
52:18 - Lauren to ask storyboard or
52:20 - programmatically for the first little
52:22 - complex app it seems like I'm getting
52:24 - I've got this question once every live
52:26 - stream so you have to code well so could
52:31 - you have to sit maybe often uh yeah
52:33 - Lauren - to answer your question like
52:36 - really quickly because I have answered
52:37 - this question before maybe I need to do
52:40 - a video on it but for beginners I would
52:47 - recommend using the storyboard because
52:50 - it's just so much easier to be able to
52:52 - visualize and especially when people
52:54 - aren't beginners aren't used to reading
52:56 - code yet or writing code even it can be
52:59 - daunting to create all your auto layout
53:01 - constraints in code and to create all of
53:03 - your elements and code and lay them out
53:05 - but if you're working in a team in a
53:07 - professional environment you're you will
53:11 - probably be forced to create everything
53:13 - programmatically because in my own
53:16 - experience it's working in the
53:18 - professional environment it's just so
53:19 - much easier to merge code like and
53:22 - resolve conflicts programmatically then
53:25 - trying to resolve conflicts in the next
53:27 - ML file which is what the storyboard is
53:29 - and then also there's the aspect that
53:31 - it's faster when you're generating
53:34 - everything programmatically so to answer
53:37 - your question I think they kind of serve
53:39 - different purposes for me Here I am
53:42 - probably going to be doing it via the
53:46 - storyboard I might be taking a hybrid
53:49 - approach when I start getting to the
53:51 - social features and basically when I
53:54 - pull that data down from the database I
53:56 - might be generating some of like the
53:57 - whatever social cards or social history
54:00 - or whatever aspects of it
54:02 - programmatically but for the timer
54:03 - aspect I might do it through storyboard
54:06 - just so because I'm gonna be
54:09 - demonstrating this and I'm then I'm
54:10 - gonna be using this project series as
54:13 - something for beginners to follow
54:17 - that's why I'm opting for that route
54:33 - you know a lot of you guys have heard of
54:35 - it before
54:38 - team film studies make a video on a
54:41 - pedometer core motion please I actually
54:44 - haven't looked into any of that stuff
54:47 - before so your best bet would be to try
54:51 - googling for it first to see of other
54:53 - YouTube or iOS content creators has
54:56 - created any tutorials for that that will
54:59 - be faster than I mean looking into it
55:03 - first and then creating a tutorial with
55:05 - it yeah
55:09 - Christopher awesome I'm glad there's
55:11 - someone that validates the the whole
55:13 - social feature aspect of it the
55:17 - telephone is your worst enemy Karl for
55:22 - me it's it's not my telephone because I
55:23 - never get calls from anyone but um it's
55:26 - probably like firing up a browser tab
55:28 - and like checking my stat YouTube stats
55:30 - or like I don't use Facebook that much
55:33 - so I'm not I'm not really distracted by
55:35 - Facebook because I know some people are
55:37 - and you know personally you know how
55:41 - they say Facebook is bad for you like it
55:43 - causes depression I kind of feel that
55:45 - way not depression per se you know not
55:48 - to that extreme but when I browse
55:50 - people's newsfeed and I see like people
55:52 - are going on vacation and they have
55:53 - these wonderful lives it just makes me
55:55 - like oh man I wish I was there or wish
55:57 - that was me and it just makes me feel
55:59 - bad about myself and so I I don't end up
56:02 - going on Facebook anymore because of
56:04 - that because I feel like people only
56:09 - post you know the best sides of their
56:11 - lives but everyone's lives just has ups
56:13 - and downs right no one has this perfect
56:15 - life that's all rainbows and sunshine
56:17 - but I'm just going off on a tangent I oh
56:24 - no once the next episode gonna be for
56:25 - this app well I am committing to do a
56:27 - livestream like every single Wednesday
56:29 - so if if not before then then it will be
56:35 - definitely next Wednesday but I'm
56:36 - thinking that I might create a
56:39 - standalone video I'm not going to commit
56:44 - to anything because I'm not completely
56:45 - sure but definitely
56:47 - next Wednesday if not before that but
56:49 - make sure you're subscribed it has the
56:51 - chance I'm gonna plug my channel make
56:53 - sure you're subscribed with the red
56:55 - subscribe button below and click that
56:57 - little bell icon to make sure you get
56:58 - notified if you don't want to miss the
57:01 - next episode
57:02 - so I own it thanks for giving me the
57:04 - chance to to plug my channel like that
57:10 - Android user do you prefer sketch or
57:12 - Adobe XD I actually haven't used Adobe
57:15 - XD before and I prefer sketch but I
57:18 - might not use any of those tools because
57:20 - I want to I want to make as much as
57:25 - possible I want to be using free tools
57:27 - so that you guys can follow along with
57:31 - it and so I'm gonna be using figma at
57:33 - least that's in my head that's what I'm
57:35 - gonna do right now and having used both
57:37 - sketch and figma figma is so similar to
57:40 - sketch it's crazy like all of the
57:43 - shortcut keys the buttons and the things
57:45 - that you can do there it's so similar
57:47 - and so yeah but personally if I like if
57:52 - I wasn't doing any demos or anything
57:54 - like that and I'm doing things for
57:55 - myself I I use sketch I haven't used the
57:59 - dhobi XD although I have a Creative
58:01 - Cloud subscription so I I think I will
58:03 - look into it in the future I can't
58:05 - compare I was about to say I haven't
58:06 - used the dhobi XD so I can't compare
58:08 - with Sketch
58:16 - team film studies I want to register
58:18 - user steps taken any experience no I
58:24 - don't have any experience with that but
58:27 - doesn't like does the health
58:30 - I know Apple watch does keep track of
58:32 - your steps but if you didn't have an
58:34 - Apple watch and you only had an iPhone
58:37 - does the health kit like the health app
58:40 - on your phone does it track steps like
58:42 - that I haven't I don't really use the
58:43 - health app on my phone but if it does
58:45 - track steps I would ask do you den need
58:49 - to track your own steps can you take the
58:51 - data from the health app you might be
58:55 - able to with your app excuse me
59:08 - voice prototyping Martin saying that
59:11 - Adobe XD has awesome new features for a
59:13 - voice prototyping I'd I don't even know
59:15 - what that is I gotta look into that
59:20 - that sounds pretty crazy like he's just
59:23 - narrate what happens or something like
59:25 - that I don't know but I'll take a look
59:28 - into it are you guys are some of you
59:31 - guys designers or like graphics
59:32 - professionals let me know let me know
59:35 - down below because when you guys see me
59:36 - using finger sketch I and and you guys
59:41 - are graphics professionals you guys will
59:42 - probably laugh I mean so I am NOT a
59:45 - professional designer but I I can do
59:49 - like the basic stuff and so I will be
59:51 - like I'm able to use it for what I need
59:54 - to use it for but I can still show you
59:59 - guys in case any of you guys don't know
60:02 - how to use fake more sketch at all no
60:10 - jesper so
60:16 - so my plan is to develop to finish the
60:20 - app well to finish V one of the app and
60:23 - launch it by the end of the month and
60:24 - that's like in two weeks right so I
60:26 - can't do it live in the live stream but
60:30 - what I'm gonna do is like I I will have
60:33 - to release videos in between the live
60:35 - streams in order to be able to show you
60:37 - guys start to finish V one out of the
60:42 - door so I know for a fact that I will
60:44 - have to record videos outside of the
60:46 - live stream to do some of this stuff to
60:48 - get it done so I hope that clarifies
60:50 - stuff Robin we have a Facebook group
60:59 - Facebook community you can go and ask
61:01 - those questions and there would be tons
61:03 - of people that'll help you out and just
61:06 - in case you guys don't know we have a
61:08 - CWC well code with chris communty it's a
61:11 - Facebook group tons of people helping
61:13 - each other out and I'm not just saying
61:14 - that I know some Facebook groups are
61:16 - completely dead not ours tons of people
61:19 - in there chatting helping each other out
61:21 - so if you have any questions on any of
61:23 - the tutorials that you see in here or
61:26 - you need help with something you're
61:27 - working on do join the group and post
61:30 - your questions in there and you'll get
61:33 - support so Adrienne thanks for posting
61:36 - the link there you are so anyways guys
61:38 - the hour is up I'm so happy to have
61:41 - spent this hour with you and I'm so glad
61:44 - you guys are on board with this and I
61:46 - feel like I am getting a little more
61:48 - comfortable in front of the camera and
61:50 - doing live streaming for you I've
61:52 - recognized some of the names you guys
61:53 - have attended like all of the three live
61:55 - streams I've done so far so thank you
61:57 - guys for that last question Mohamed what
62:02 - are you used for sketching I just sketch
62:04 - with pencil and a notepad so you know
62:09 - pretty basic stuff but then I'll
62:11 - translate that into wireframes and
62:13 - design which I'll show you guys the next
62:15 - time we talk thank you guys again so
62:18 - much and make sure you subscribe to see
62:21 - either the next video maybe like Friday
62:23 - or Tuesday or if not then I will talk to
62:26 - you guys
62:27 - Wednesday at the same time okay so thank
62:29 - you guys so much I'll chat with you guys
62:31 - later bye and this video will be
62:34 - recorded so if you guys are you coming
62:36 - late and you want to catch up with what
62:37 - happened in the beginning it will be
62:39 - recorded and published on the channel
62:41 - alright I'll see you guys next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys can you see me can you hear me let me know in the chat below just so we know things are working out and we'll get started in just a minute hey guys can you hear me and hopefully you guys can all see my screen as well I'm super excited today to start this livestream because we're actually going to start an app from start to finish and this is not planned out this is I haven't built this out before there are things that I haven't figured out myself I don't know if this app idea that I have exists so we're gonna go through all of those steps together but I just want to wait a couple more minutes for people to join and we'll get started hey guys hey Chris hey Musa Angela Prakash hey Musa you should actually be able to see my screen I just have a quick agenda on there you guys should all be able to see my screen right now if you can't try refreshing the page I don't know but I am sharing my screen right now I am optimal if you have Windows 10 you have a couple of options we actually have an article for PC users and kind of the options that they have so Adrienne will send that link all right so let's get started if you guys don't know me my name is Chris this is the first time you're on the channel welcome to code with Chris where we teach people how to build iOS apps basically Adrienne is manning the chat and so please be nice to him send in your questions one by one and don't break up your messages into multiple messages and that's gonna help him be able to make sure all your questions get answered but in this live stream I don't know if we'll have a Q&A time we might this is gonna run for an hour and I'm not really gonna be teaching so much as showing in this live stream because like I said this live stream we're gonna start by taking an app idea that I have explain what it is we're gonna look into the app store check out what sorts of apps are existing for this kind of idea maybe check their reviews to see if people complain about certain things we're gonna go through some features and requirements and again this is all from scratch so I haven't I don't have these listed out beforehand I haven't given it any thought so there's gonna be some audience participation right you're gonna be able to suggest features for me for this app we're going to discuss mmm sort of which features should make it into the first version of the app which feature should be like a later phase and I'll show you how I break things up so that mmm I aim to get the project complete and out the door rather than trying to get the whole thing polished and perfect right and super duper feature full before shipping it that's not the way that I think we should work but I'll explain all of that later and then I'll talk about some of the challenges that I foresee with building this app some of the things that I still need to figure out some of the things that I've already figured out like I've done in the past so it shouldn't be a roadblock for me and I think that even though I don't have everything figured out that's that's why I'm doing this so I think it'll be very helpful for you guys to see that building an app isn't like isn't always a smooth process right it's a bumpy road and even for someone like me who you know I was doing it professionally in IT consulting for like five years it's still there's still things to figure out because there's always new features in the SDK there's you know things like even things I've done in the past I don't remember sometimes right so I have to go back and nowadays Google is awesome and having this resource and having all of these people create all of this content for iOS development and then all of the documentation available online it's great like I know some of the people who have been in the tech industry for a while and back then before you know before the internet so widespread we would have to dig through text books and try hopefully try to find the solution to your problem by just flipping through pages of thick tech book tech textbooks and relying on more senior people in the company to perhaps have encountered that problem before and help you solve it but these days development I think has changed a lot where as you can use Google and find your answers hopefully within minutes oh really do utilize that and I am going off on a tangent so I'll stop talking about that but let's get started with unveiling my app idea for this big project and it's basically a Pomodoro timer so if you know if you know what that is there are a ton of Pomodoro timer apps in the App Store already I can tell you that right now and I'll explain what Pomodoro is in a second for those of you guys who don't know but my idea for a Pomodoro timer and it's not an original idea is to integrate social features into the Pomodoro timer so that you can connect with friends like you can add friends to your account and then you guys can see each other's like Pomodoro's how many Pomodoro you have completed during that day so you can motivate each other and can challenge each other to do more Pomodoro's now before I get too far ahead of myself for those of you guys who don't know what the Pomodoro Technique is let me just explain very very quickly and I actually found a graphic on on Google and it talks about it like really really succinctly a Pomodoro timer is basically a timer what so let me back up the Pomodoro Technique I don't even know who developed it but if you google it there was a guy who invented this technique but basically overall revolves around productivity and how to stay productive so the idea works like this you set a timer for 25 minutes and during those twenty five minutes you remove all distractions you just focus on that one thing that you're doing for 25 minutes your timer is going to go off at the end of 25 minutes at that point take a short break which is a fiveminute break so for five minutes you just you know get up stretch whatever and then you do another Pomodoro for 25 minutes same task until you get it done so you keep repeating this process you know twentyfive minutes of work five minutes of break until you reach for Pomodoro so you've worked for a hundred minutes then you take a longer break and they recommend a 15minute break I think for a long break but there is some flexibility and how you use the system so you can you know you can take a longer break as long as you want and then you get back to it so the idea is that a it helps you remove all distractions because your mind thinks oh for twentyfive minutes I just have to do this task for 25 minutes and it makes it easier to start right for something that you really really don't want to do and you're procrastinating if you just think I'm just gonna do 25 minutes and then once you get into it you just obviously you do more and more until it's done number two it helps you estimate tasks because if you do that task a lot and you're setting your Pomodoro timers you'll be able to then better estimate how long like how many Pomodoro's that task will take and so you can break up your workday if you have like eight hours or six hours or whatever you can then gauge better how much work you can actually fit in so that's the whole idea of the Pomodoro Technique what I've been using myself is this website called tomato timer and it's like the most basic website you will ever find for this sort of thing but it works and that's why I use it so all you do is you hit start the timer goes for 25 minutes and when those 25 minutes are up it beeps and then you just stop it you reset it and then you go to this tab where it's going to give you a fiveminute break then you take your 5minute break and you go back to the Pomodoro for 25 minutes and after you've done four of them you take a long break so personally when I use this Pomodoro Technique to try to stay productive I don't keep track of how many Pomodoro's I've done I mostly use this as a way to remove distraction because in my mind I'm like I just have to focus for twenty five minutes and also as a motivator to do things that I don't really want to do and if I didn't have anything like this I would just put off those things continuously so I think we all have tasks like that so personally I find this very useful and I know there are apps out there there's like a ton of apps in the App Store for this sort of simple time work but I don't think there is one which has these social features integrated where you can kind of chair each other on and be like oh how many palma doors that you do how many did i do and then just help each other stay productive and again this is not my original idea I was reading a blog post from it was on search engine optimization and this guy he uses Pomodoro timers religiously and one way that he stays so productive is that he he has a partner which he works with and they chat through the messages app and they basically they just tell each other how many Pomodoro's they did and it kind of because they have a competitive nature they kind of spur each other on to do more and so he was he was saying like he can't find anything out there for this sort of social twist to the Pomodoro Technique and if someone were to create it then he would be the first to use it and so that kind of gave me the idea and I think it it would be useful like even if no one paid me any money to do it I think I would use it so that's that's kind of my motivation I'm not doing this for money or anything and I thought that this would be also a great project to share with you guys to go on this journey and take this idea or I build it out submit it to the app store build like a website for it just basically go through the whole thing and you guys can experience all of the ups and downs and the roadblocks and the challenges and I think that's what some of you guys said that you wanted to see and I thought it was a really good idea actually with that because there are a ton of iOS tutorials out there right but what's the problem with all of this knowledge it's that it relies on the reader or the watch or the viewer right to take that knowledge and turn it into practice right be practical with it because just consuming content just reading just watching it doesn't help you get anything done and unless you turn that knowledge into wisdom through doing the work right that's that's the point where that knowledge actually gives you dividends and gives you like a return on return on investment yeah so hopefully this candid real journey of me building this app and showing you guys all of the steps and processes helps you guys understand what it's really like all right behind the curtains and hopefully it inspires you guys to start now in the beginning of next month in the beginning of November I'll be it's kind of not hosting but I'll be starting like a challenge like an app challenge and I think I've talked about this in the previous livestream where I want to get as many people who feel comfortable building apps no matter how simple they are to be involved and the goal is to try to build and ship an app within a month and I think that's completely doable as long as your scope isn't like out to space right if you pick something that's gonna be doable for your skill level I think that's totally doable and I think the point is not to make money or not to you know not to do anything like that the point is to get into the practice of actually producing stuff actually putting into practice what you're learning and actually shipping products because I think you know there's this there's this sort of danger of always tweaking something and trying to get it perfect or always just working on designs and prototypes and daydreaming about stuff right that's not until you actually ship something and maybe get some feedback on it that we're we're you know that you're either onto something or maybe you should close the door on that so got that's gonna be the challenge starting November 1st and for those of you guys who aren't at the skill level where you feel like you can build anything yet I'll have another learning path for you guys to take for the next 28 days where you can get yourself up to speed so that's all coming up and really excited about that but anyways now that we have the intro out of the way let's get started with the next part which is uh so I've told you about my app idea the next part I wanted to do with you guys it's actually just check out the App Store now I've downloaded a couple of the Pomodoro timers by couple I actually mean two and one I found really confusing to use I feel like a timer should just when you launch it you should be able to just see a start button and start it but some of these are actually the way that they've done the user interface is actually a little bit confusing so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plug in my phone and hopefully I can show it on the screen we're gonna check out the app store see what's available and hopefully I don't see a Pomodoro timer which already has the social features included because as I didn't look very hard and as far as I know it doesn't exist so we're gonna check that out let me plug in my phone right here alright so hopefully you guys can see my phone see it on the screen right now okay so in case you guys were wondering the app is not going to be submitted to the App Store today right today we are starting the journey to do this so I think by the end of this livestream we will have a list of requirements flushed out the bare minimum requirements to submit to the App Store as an MVP or Minimum Viable Product and I'll be able to tell you guys about what my next steps are in terms of figuring out some of the challenges that are gonna exist for me all right so I'm looking in the App Store here I'm gonna do a search for I'm just gonna search for the more general term just to see what comes up so focus keeper is one which I actually downloaded and this is the one which I'm currently using the nice thing about this one is that it has all of these nice graphs and I really like the idea of it logging how many Pomodoro's you've done and being able to see over time the work that you've done because that's one thing that I'm not doing right now I just use the timer I turn it I time it and I stop it and I just use that tomato timer I showed you doesn't keep track of any history so just by using the app which I've been using this one for the last maybe a couple of days it's nice to be able to keep track of that so this one is pretty easy to use right it's got a start start and a stop but this one doesn't have any of the social features which which I'm targeting and that has some pretty good rating so what I would do is probably take a look at some of the reviews and see what people do like about it and hopefully try to emulate some of those features into the app that we're building right now so there's that yeah this is another kind of like version I guess of a Pomodoro timer but it's not it's not really based off of the Pomodoro Technique for timers like this it's basically like you set the time that you want to work and if you take your phone and try to do something else with it like go on Facebook or whatever then the tree that you're growing is gonna die so the motivation is to stay focused is to not kill your tree so I want to consider this to be a Pomodoro timer it's a Productivity tool but the Pomodoro timer and this one here this one's just in Chinese it's not really my target market but I think it looks like at a bare minimum you've got the timers and then you've got charts right to keep track of how much you've worked which definitely we we should have and some of these some of these as well they're not just Pomodoro timers they're also like todo lists and there are gold trackers and stuff like that and personally this is my personal opinion I feel like if your app tries to do too much it's gonna be convoluted and it's gonna be more confusing to use and so when I built this Pomodoro timer app it's purely going to be for the Pomodoro Technique and I'm not gonna try to put todo lists or goals or anything like that and then we're gonna have the social aspect all based around the Pomodoro that you complete see this one has habit training and mono tasking I wouldn't call this like a pure Pomodoro Technique either based on the Pomodoro Technique yeah make a todo list now Rustom how to quit learning how to quit the learning regimen and start doing your own project so you you just got that you just got to start but I know it can be confusing as to where to start and so I do have a learning plan that I'm going to come up with starting November 1st that's gonna be free for everyone to use and it's gonna basically be like day one you do that stay tuned you do this and you just follow that and hopefully that motivates you guys to actually do stuff rather than just continually learning because I know it can be tempting to just watch like ten videos and then you know backtoback like a Netflix binging session but that's not really helpful creative rewarding daily have a routine you know what I don't see anything yeah okay this was the other one that I've used flat tomato I downloaded this one I found it really hard to use I didn't didn't really understand because the the interface was so minimal that when I launched it I saw this clock face but there were no like buttons to tell me what to press or what actions to take and I found it really confusing to use but it still got has pretty good rating so maybe I'm just dumb yeah all right so I'm kind of focus I'm sorry I'm kind of satisfied to me yeah see they're a ton of these things but I don't think any of them have had this the sort of social feature it's all very like focused on your own to do the next thing to do I'm not going to do with this right here because it's it's a little mindnumbing but it would be to go through some of the reviews for these apps and kind of see what people are saying about the app what did they like about it what do they don't like about it and that sort of knowledge will sort of guide you into what sorts of features that you should implement into your own app or maybe how to design the user interface of your app like if if a particular app has really good reviews I would suggest you download it and play around with it and see kind of how they did their UI and I want to say copy it but I would say let it guide you and your design when you're designing your own up and so I'm gonna I'm gonna move on now to writing out our own feature set for our app right here I'm just gonna minimize that and we're just gonna do this right here so I will just write it right here features and requirements see if you guys can see this on the screen all right so I would say and I'm gonna break this right right now into like a v1 youtube because I'm gonna tell you right now my v1 is going to be super simple because if you've seen my video right here which I released recently called finish your projects or five tips to help you complete your projects I recommend that you should take your overall feature set and break it down into an MVP that is manageable so what what is the minimum amount of core features your app needs to have to still be useful and so that's what I'm going to base it on to me this tomato timer on this website this is like the bare minimum I think that you need in order to follow the Pomodoro Technique so there's like no history there's no tracking there's no social features there's no charts nothing and so I'm gonna base my v1 off of something like this where you you literally just have three timers start and stop and reset and you know that that is literally it so my v1 is going to be something like we have the 25 minute timer right we have the five minute break timer and we have the long 15 minute fifteen minute long break timer and I think in order for it to be useful as well as a Pomodoro timer is if like let's say you get a phone call or something pops up in your app and if you're really sticking to your Pomodoro Technique you're not supposed to be distracted by any of that but let's just say if you do and this app goes into the background I feel like it should still be tracking the time right so that it doesn't like pause the timer when your app goes into the background so I feel like as even as a v1 the app needs to keep or how about let's just say timer needs to continue to run in the background like if you've had if you have that timer set so that's one of the things that I actually don't know how to do but I know it can be done because obviously it can because everyone has these Pomodoro timer apps out there I just need to figure out how to do it and I'm sure it's not very hard because in order to run things in the background I do know that you need to enable certain capabilities for your app so I think it it's just that I think it's just specifying that your app needs to run timers or maybe schedule the reminder or something like that I just need to investigate that so that's one of the challenges but I'll get into that let me see if you guys have any suggestions okay so if you guys do have suggestions type it in now I am keeping track of the chat now so I mean just two future so I don't have to organize those but definitely social features right we're talking about ability for users to create an account also abilities ability for a user to use it as a guest so if people want to use the timer and not create an account and just use the app without the social features out I do want to allow that as well so there or let's say let's break this up into social features timer features so for this would be like ability to set or to customize the durations of breaks or work timers see what you guys are saying ability to set targets Martin maybe you can expand on what you mean by targets do you mean ah so you mean like a goal for how many Pomodoro's you're gonna do that date integration into messages maybe Kevin you can expand on that like in what way would would it integrate into the messages app like would you share your progress with someone through messages that what you're talking about okay Martin we yeah I'm gonna write that down so this would be like goal setting ability to set a daily goal for the amount of palms mom's the palms you're going to do call this sharing I have to merge some of this actually sharing we probably go into social ability to share your progress with others so this would be kind of like a share extension type of thing so that you can share it with messages or whatsapp or anything like that let me just type out some more of these ability for user to follow follow let's follow the right word or add as to add friends ability to like we would need user profiles right so that you can see how many Pomodoro's your friend is doing or something like that Billy to to view user profiles I think what would be very cool is like if you could issue challenges right like if you can have a running challenge with another person or maybe a group of people where you set you set a goal like oh every day you have to do like the goal everyone agrees on is like every day you have to do ten Pomodoro's or something and then whoever doesn't do it gets like kicked out of the group or dropped out and then like you can see who's left standing like king of the hill styles I don't know that's just an idea but I'm gonna write it down ability to issue challenges with a single person or group and we can elaborate on that needs more detail see what you guys are saying yeah Martin I agree yeah I agree with sending daily weekly targets I just don't want to get too far out there that this turns into kind of like a habit tracker as well because I want to stay really focused that this is just like a very strict Pomodoro timer but I might you know I might change my mind on that that's the way I feel right now but see this is the this is why we do an MVP right so we're gonna release the v1 it's a simple timer v2 we might add some of the social features and then depending on what people start saying if people start using this and saying like oh I wish I had this I wish I had that then we're gonna have to start evaluating what's best for the users because you do want to the idea is to iterate on this idea in this product to turn it into something that people love using oh I know now you're saying the long break is 30 minutes yeah I have to verify I have to verify that it might be 30 minutes you might be completely right I don't I'm not so sure if it might be 15 minutes or not I'm just gonna say like X minute like what is the the long break that the Pomodoro Technique actually recommends I don't for me personally I I just take like X number of minutes I don't keep track of how long my break is I go off and do something and whenever I'm done taking a break I just come back and start another cycle of for Pomodoro's oh I don't really like that I really like the the messages like keep going the encouragement right Martin so the user profile is not going to be not not social profile it's gonna be like how many Pomodoro's have that has this guy done today and in you know in the last week or something like that so the idea is to keep each other come to stay productive and to to be doing work I'm gonna put Iona I'm gonna put your feature under goal setting so encouragement quotes yeah happy images so I've kind of decided that this is gonna be like v1 we can probably crank this out pretty quickly because I do like my goal is gonna be try to try to release this v1 by the end of the month so that when we start the app challenge on November 1st I can be ready to do like a phase 2 version of the app and I'm gonna use that as my monthlong app challenge so I'm gonna keep v1 really simple and probably not very useful to be honest compared to all of the other Pomodoro timers out there but I don't really care I'm just gonna because I think mentally just getting it shipped getting it released in the App Store is a milestone in my head and that's gonna keep me motivated to do v2 right I think when we're talking about motivation like I run into the same problems as you guys do if if any of you guys suffer from that like I said before I have tons of halfdone projects in a folder somewhere on my computer and I'm really scared to to publicly now right I'm doing this with you guys to cut the cord on this I don't really want to do that so I'm gonna set v1 to be very manageable to be something like I'm pretty confident like 99% that I can get this done and shipped and then we are going to improve on that from there so I'm I'm following my own advice guys in the five tips on how to finish your project follow my own advice here social features so you know I don't know if we have to decide on a v2 right now but I feel like if you two might be to be able to set durations like that seems pretty pretty necessary because everyone uses plummet or a little differently some people take longer breaks some people not and the social aspect like integrating the ability to create an account like even even having to create an account requires a backend so at this point we're getting into databases right and so that's compared to everything else that's a large part of work so it would be you also it would be useless to introduce the ability to create an account but that's it right oh I forgot so let me finish that train of thought so it would be useless to be able to create an account but not do anything with it so if we were to introduce this the ability to create an account we would have to also introduce the ability to like add friends and follow friends and maybe like like there you know maybe give them a thumbs up when they've completed a Pomodoro or something like that but I was about to say that we forgot a huge piece here and that would be like history I don't know if that's the right word but basically like tracking how much work you've done like keeping track of poems completed every day showing them in a graph oh I don't know why I'm capitalizing some of these ability to change date range on the graph so stuff like that like ability to manipulate the graph so that you can see how many you how many maybe Pomodoro's you've done in the last month versus the last week versus the last three days or whatever like that and maybe to be able to average it out so this definitely neat it needs more detail needs more thought around it but see doing this stuff doesn't require user accounts either so we can keep track of this data locally on their device right when they do create an account though we could with her sync that data somewhere so that if they logged in to that same account on another device or maybe they're using two devices at once or maybe in the future would create like a Mac app version of this app as well then the data can get synced into that same account so you know data syncing I actually don't know if this has an H or not I look right all right data syncing so ability to transfer data to another device or keep data in sync with another device let's see what you guys are saying right here oh you have tons of halfdone online courses same with me same with me it's you know like life happens things come up it's tough it's tough in a hair Here I am like I'm I have online courses right hate for people so like first hand I know how hard it is to to make time for this stuff yeah I own a thumb I don't want this app to have to be connected to the Internet to work because it shouldn't right just only for the social features it would be yeah Kevin you're right so Kevin says the ability to categorize the palms that you work on whether that's for like school or work or maybe another cat look Billy Billy to set categories so that when you're looking at your history you can see how much work you've done in each category I think that that kind of goes with goal setting I think no timer features I put this under here ability to choose a category for the palm you're running and filter based on category Sofer Khan I'm sorry if I am butchering your name but he's saying the integration with github or bitbucket to buy in the palm with a repository to track how many hours of code in the repo that's interesting that's interesting just get help a bit okay track hours like that I'm actually not familiar with that but I'm gonna write it down I just could make a Miska category with I just say source control so just for us well the social feature work with teams like setting a timer for an entire team I've actually seen that done with this app called a forest which is a Productivity app that revolves around timers as well and I think they've just released a feature or maybe it's not recent but I recently discovered that they have a feature where you can like put your phones together and sync up a timer so like you said if coworkers are working together they have like a group timer and if anyone picks up their phone I think it kills it kills the tree or whatever they're trying to grow for for the whole team so it keeps the whole team focused but to answer your question just for I haven't I haven't thought about it whether it will work together as a team I'm gonna write that down but in my head right now I don't have any I don't have any I haven't thought about doing that so I'm gonna write that down okay let's build a milliondollar Pomodoro app you know what I haven't even thought about monetization I don't like I said my goal isn't to to make money from the app I honestly would just like to use it and I think that's the best motivation although it's kind of idealistic because people need money to survive so if we were to to charge money for it I don't know we could try different forms of monetization now that would be an interesting experiment experiment I think we should do it we should try like just because we're building this together I think you guys would all be interested to see like how much potential you know money we could make off of often releasing an app and monetizing it too right so there are so many different ways to monetize it but like one one way that comes to mind right now would be to be like have a banner with an inapp purchase to remove it let's say for pro version and then like you see apps telling people they could use it for free right but then pro version unlocks maybe like the history version aspect of it or anything else I do believe we cannot put the social features behind a paywall because that's kind of what is the differentiator for this app right without the social features then how is this any different from any of the other Pomodoro timers out there in the app store right now right I wouldn't say any yeah so I'm gonna have to take some time away to take a look at these features which we've talked about and come up with a v2 but I don't think I have to do that until closer to the end of the month I'm gonna focus on doing this part v1 which is pretty doable the only thing I need to figure out right is is this timer in the background and the next time I talk to you guys I'm gonna make it a goal to have figured that out so I can tell you guys what I had to do but the next steps traditionally let me bring up another video that I've done that's this one called the app design process and that basically just runs through the different steps typically taken in building an app so we have now completed like the first step which is basically to gather the requirements for the app and figure out the core MVP version the next step would be to wireframe it out so that you can design kind of like the UI for the for the app and then it would be designed and then it would be development and then integrating the design testing it and releasing it so me coming from as a developer the thing that I like to do all the time is I like to figure out all of the technical challenges first a guy I like to make sure that I can actually do all of these things before starting on the UI and the design and stuff like that because I feel like there's no point in designing an element or a feature if when it comes down to it I can't achieve it technically right so there's nothing here that like the this I told you guys I don't know how to do right now but I know it can be done so I'm not that worried about having to completely figure that out first right so in the next video in this sort of how to make an app from scratch series I'll be mocking up the screens for this version now I'm not gonna go ahead and wireframe all of the screens for like all of these features because we haven't really figured out exactly which features are gonna make the cut and in what order what I'm gonna be focused on is the timer screen because that's really the screen that people are gonna be spending the most time on right and I think that screen has a lot it has a huge impact on whether that person will use the app or not and this is based on my experience I told you guys I downloaded two Pomodoro apps I launched the first one I tapped on the timer it was confusing I started it and I didn't know how to stop the timer or pause the timer and like I was just trying to figure out how to use it and I just gave up and I just like closed the app and then launched the other one and simply for the fact that I it was easy for me to figure out how to start and stop that timer I ended up sticking with that app and using that up so that's why it's so important for for the UI at some of the other Pomodoro apps out there like I told you reading their reviews especially for the highly rated ones taking a look at maybe I can find a commonality in the UI for all of the highly rated ones that I'm gonna take those considerations into my own design process when I'm like wireframing that up so I'm gonna do that work offline however in the next video I am going to recreate the wireframe with you guys if if I've already done that so that I can show you guys how to use the graphic design tools to create a wireframe I'm not gonna just show up and be like hey guys I created the wireframe here you go this is then you guys want wouldn't be able to do that for your own apps right so in the next video or a livestream whatever it might be I will show you guys how to navigate around a graphics design tool and how to create some wireframes I'm in that tool and I will have figured out what my UI will look like so we'll build that wireframe of that v1 version together in that graphics tool and then from there all right well we'll build it out which is like I'm looking at it it's a pretty simple app and then we're gonna launch it together in the app store so you're gonna get to see you know the things that you're gonna be testing the things that the assets that you'll need will create the app icon launch screen and stuff like that and we'll publish it together and then starting in November when we're gonna when I'm gonna run that challenge we'll take a look at v2 for the app and yeah so hopefully you guys stick around and now we've got about 12 more minutes I'm gonna take a look at what sort of questions you guys have if you have any questions oh sorry about that I will talk louder and into my mic I should move this mic sorry if you guys had trouble hearing me just now but let me take a look at your chat let's see if you guys have any questions for me well the November challenge have a have a theme do you think you guys would want a theme I don't want to restrict you guys to to building something so maybe maybe I could think of a theme that you can follow or not see yes this is how this is gonna be the first time that I'm doing this it might be a freeforall this time because my ultimate goal is just to get people to do things right to get people off of their butt and to actually do something so I haven't yet formalized like what's sort of prizes or recognition there might be and there will be recognition for sure prizes for this first one I'm not but it I do plan for it to be a monthly thing and I want to just motivate people to to get off their butt to do stuff so if you guys have any questions for me just type it into the chat right now I'm just going through the chat mmhmm Iona I missed this the speaker idea that you had which is changing the music or the alarm that sounds depending on the project you're working or maybe having an ability to customize that mmhmm that's kind of cool women right write that down right here just for we use the Pomodoro Technique while developing your Pomodoro up you have my chest my chest maybe you guys let me know like how many of you guys have actually heard of about the Pomodoro Technique before and how many of you guys actually use it yourself I'd be interesting to hear because I think it's a pretty wellknown technique Nelson thank you thank you for your compliment Lauren to ask storyboard or programmatically for the first little complex app it seems like I'm getting I've got this question once every live stream so you have to code well so could you have to sit maybe often uh yeah Lauren to answer your question like really quickly because I have answered this question before maybe I need to do a video on it but for beginners I would recommend using the storyboard because it's just so much easier to be able to visualize and especially when people aren't beginners aren't used to reading code yet or writing code even it can be daunting to create all your auto layout constraints in code and to create all of your elements and code and lay them out but if you're working in a team in a professional environment you're you will probably be forced to create everything programmatically because in my own experience it's working in the professional environment it's just so much easier to merge code like and resolve conflicts programmatically then trying to resolve conflicts in the next ML file which is what the storyboard is and then also there's the aspect that it's faster when you're generating everything programmatically so to answer your question I think they kind of serve different purposes for me Here I am probably going to be doing it via the storyboard I might be taking a hybrid approach when I start getting to the social features and basically when I pull that data down from the database I might be generating some of like the whatever social cards or social history or whatever aspects of it programmatically but for the timer aspect I might do it through storyboard just so because I'm gonna be demonstrating this and I'm then I'm gonna be using this project series as something for beginners to follow that's why I'm opting for that route you know a lot of you guys have heard of it before team film studies make a video on a pedometer core motion please I actually haven't looked into any of that stuff before so your best bet would be to try googling for it first to see of other YouTube or iOS content creators has created any tutorials for that that will be faster than I mean looking into it first and then creating a tutorial with it yeah Christopher awesome I'm glad there's someone that validates the the whole social feature aspect of it the telephone is your worst enemy Karl for me it's it's not my telephone because I never get calls from anyone but um it's probably like firing up a browser tab and like checking my stat YouTube stats or like I don't use Facebook that much so I'm not I'm not really distracted by Facebook because I know some people are and you know personally you know how they say Facebook is bad for you like it causes depression I kind of feel that way not depression per se you know not to that extreme but when I browse people's newsfeed and I see like people are going on vacation and they have these wonderful lives it just makes me like oh man I wish I was there or wish that was me and it just makes me feel bad about myself and so I I don't end up going on Facebook anymore because of that because I feel like people only post you know the best sides of their lives but everyone's lives just has ups and downs right no one has this perfect life that's all rainbows and sunshine but I'm just going off on a tangent I oh no once the next episode gonna be for this app well I am committing to do a livestream like every single Wednesday so if if not before then then it will be definitely next Wednesday but I'm thinking that I might create a standalone video I'm not going to commit to anything because I'm not completely sure but definitely next Wednesday if not before that but make sure you're subscribed it has the chance I'm gonna plug my channel make sure you're subscribed with the red subscribe button below and click that little bell icon to make sure you get notified if you don't want to miss the next episode so I own it thanks for giving me the chance to to plug my channel like that Android user do you prefer sketch or Adobe XD I actually haven't used Adobe XD before and I prefer sketch but I might not use any of those tools because I want to I want to make as much as possible I want to be using free tools so that you guys can follow along with it and so I'm gonna be using figma at least that's in my head that's what I'm gonna do right now and having used both sketch and figma figma is so similar to sketch it's crazy like all of the shortcut keys the buttons and the things that you can do there it's so similar and so yeah but personally if I like if I wasn't doing any demos or anything like that and I'm doing things for myself I I use sketch I haven't used the dhobi XD although I have a Creative Cloud subscription so I I think I will look into it in the future I can't compare I was about to say I haven't used the dhobi XD so I can't compare with Sketch team film studies I want to register user steps taken any experience no I don't have any experience with that but doesn't like does the health I know Apple watch does keep track of your steps but if you didn't have an Apple watch and you only had an iPhone does the health kit like the health app on your phone does it track steps like that I haven't I don't really use the health app on my phone but if it does track steps I would ask do you den need to track your own steps can you take the data from the health app you might be able to with your app excuse me voice prototyping Martin saying that Adobe XD has awesome new features for a voice prototyping I'd I don't even know what that is I gotta look into that that sounds pretty crazy like he's just narrate what happens or something like that I don't know but I'll take a look into it are you guys are some of you guys designers or like graphics professionals let me know let me know down below because when you guys see me using finger sketch I and and you guys are graphics professionals you guys will probably laugh I mean so I am NOT a professional designer but I I can do like the basic stuff and so I will be like I'm able to use it for what I need to use it for but I can still show you guys in case any of you guys don't know how to use fake more sketch at all no jesper so so my plan is to develop to finish the app well to finish V one of the app and launch it by the end of the month and that's like in two weeks right so I can't do it live in the live stream but what I'm gonna do is like I I will have to release videos in between the live streams in order to be able to show you guys start to finish V one out of the door so I know for a fact that I will have to record videos outside of the live stream to do some of this stuff to get it done so I hope that clarifies stuff Robin we have a Facebook group Facebook community you can go and ask those questions and there would be tons of people that'll help you out and just in case you
