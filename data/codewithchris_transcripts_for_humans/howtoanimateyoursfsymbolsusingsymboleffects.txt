00:00 - SF symbols already made our lives so 
much easier by providing ready to use  
00:03 - out-of-the-box icons and now in iOS 17 apple 
is letting us add effects and animations to  
00:10 - them with a single Swift UI modifier with just 
one line of code you can add effects like these  
00:16 - iOS 17 and Mac OS Sonoma introduce a collection 
of universal animations that can be applied to  
00:23 - any symbol image even custom symbols in this 
video you're going to learn how to do the  
00:28 - following five things how to add SF symbols to 
your app number two how to animate those symbols  
00:33 - using symbol effects number three the types of 
effects that you can do and number four tweaking  
00:38 - and customizing the symbol effects just so we're 
on the same page here is how you add an SF symbol  
00:44 - to your app use the Swift UI image component 
and you use the system name initializer and  
00:50 - then you pass in as a string the name of the 
symbol there you go how do you get the name  
00:55 - for the symbol well you can download the SF 
symbols Mac app which is free you can browse  
01:00 - for the symbol that you want and you can copy 
the name and that's what you put as the string  
01:04 - in here so very very easy to use these icons 
out of the box no need to design anything now  
01:11 - apple has a modifier called symbol effect which 
allows us to add a small effect or animation to  
01:21 - the symbol you'll notice that this modifier 
has a couple of options that you can specify  
01:25 - and we're going to go through that in a second 
but for now let's do a simple pulse animation  
01:32 - now you can see it pulsing back and forth let's 
take a look at the effects that you can do and how  
01:37 - to specify them now take a look at this chart on 
the left hand side going down you'll see the list  
01:43 - of effects that you can use out of the box and 
apply to your SF symbol to get a little animation  
01:49 - however these effects can be applied to your 
SF symbol in different ways and that is what  
01:55 - is across the top there's discrete indefinite 
transition and content transition so discrete  
02:01 - is when it happens once so when you trigger 
the bounce effect it happens once and then it  
02:07 - returns back to its normal state next you have 
indefinite and these effects are applied kind of  
02:12 - like a light switch they are either active or 
they're inactive and when they are active the  
02:17 - animation continues to play or hold for example 
for pulse it can either be discrete meaning that  
02:24 - you trigger it once the icon pulses once or you 
can apply it indefinitely where it continues to  
02:31 - pulse until you turn it off if you look carefully 
some effects can be applied multiple ways whereas  
02:37 - some effects like scale can only be applied in 
the indefinite manner next you have transition  
02:43 - this type of effect animates the symbol either 
into view or out of view and last but not least  
02:49 - you have con content transition which is changing 
from one symbol to another alright now let's jump  
02:54 - into xcode and see these things in action and how 
to apply them all right let's start with bounce  
02:58 - first so here's how that looks like you can see 
that the different parts of the symbol actually  
03:04 - move independently so it looks pretty cool and 
this is a discrete effect so it happens once when  
03:11 - you trigger it and how do you apply this effect so 
here you see that I have my SF symbol it's a Wi-Fi  
03:17 - exclamation mark and I applied a scale effect to 
it so that you can see it more clearly otherwise  
03:22 - it would look really small on the simulator and 
here is the actual symbol effect modifier so I  
03:28 - specified that it was a bounce and next you have 
a second parameter called value and then here you  
03:34 - can put something like an INT or a Bool anything 
that can change because as soon as you change the  
03:40 - value of that parameter it will trigger the effect 
to happen once so you can see that my trigger is  
03:47 - in int and when the button trigger is pressed I 
just increment it and that change in the value is  
03:55 - detected and triggers the bounce next let's take 
a look at Pulse so for this one it can either be  
04:00 - discrete or indefinite let's take a look at 
the discrete version so if I press trigger it  
04:08 - will happen once and this is done in the same 
way as the bounce effect so here is my symbol  
04:15 - here is the symbol effect pulse and I specified 
value trigger so exact same way we looked at the  
04:22 - bounce effect when I press it when that value 
changes you can see here I'm incrementing it  
04:27 - when the value changes it happens once the next is 
indefinite so you can see it keeps going until I  
04:36 - turn it off it's kind of like a light switch and 
now I'll turn it off and it'll stop so how do you  
04:42 - apply an indefinite symbol effect and that's down 
here so here I have the same symbol and I have  
04:49 - simple effect pulse but instead of value I specify 
the is active parameter and here you put a Boolean  
04:57 - true is when it is applied so the light switch 
is on and when I flip this to false the effect  
05:04 - will be not applied so here my button simply 
toggles the Boolean to between true and false  
05:12 - so right now it's true now it's false so that is 
the indefinite type of effect let's take a look  
05:20 - at variable color effect this one is probably the 
coolest one so this can be discrete or indefinite  
05:29 - so I tap it once that's the discrete version 
happens once here's the indefinite version
05:36 - now some symbol effects are cooler than others 
it really depends on the symbol I noticed with  
05:41 - the symbols that have these sort of waves you get 
this sort of iterative effect whereas a lot of the  
05:47 - symbols when you use variable color it sort of 
just pulses in and out again to apply the effect  
05:53 - discreetly use the value parameter in the symbol 
effect modifier to apply indefinitely use the is  
06:00 - active parameter and pass in a Boolean let's take 
a look at the scale effect now this you can only  
06:06 - apply indefinitely so it's either on or off so 
this one is actually scaled down so you take a  
06:12 - look at this one is a little bit interesting here 
because here is my SF symbol and the effect is  
06:19 - scale but you have to specify scale up or down so 
let's actually change that to dot scale dot up and  
06:25 - when I tap on it you can see that it grew a little 
bit and it will stay that way until I turn the  
06:31 - effect off and it'll scale back to its original 
state so scale down we'll just sort of shrink it  
06:39 - like that when it's active so it's scaled down 
it's inactive so it scales back up and you'll  
06:45 - notice that there is an animation between the 
states which is really really cool now we're going  
06:52 - to take a look at appear and this can be either 
indefinite or transition let's take a look at  
06:57 - indefinite first since we are pretty familiar with 
this we use the is active and we pass in a Boolean  
07:02 - so up here is hidden is initially set to false 
so that's why it's visible let's toggle it so  
07:10 - there I just turned it to false and it is hidden 
okay let's take a look at transition because this  
07:16 - one's a little bit different from what we've seen 
so far so this one is also a Boolean and I have  
07:24 - an if statement here that actually completely 
removes the image symbol if this is hidden so  
07:33 - it's actually being removed from the view it's 
not in the view hierarchy if it is hidden and  
07:40 - notice how I don't use the symbol effect modifier 
for this I use a transition modifier and I pass  
07:46 - in the symbol effect and then I specify that it 
is an appear symbol effect so let's take a look  
07:54 - so it's pretty quick but you'll see that when 
I it comes into view there is an animation  
08:01 - of it coming into view and the difference is that 
this is removed from from The View hierarchy so it  
08:07 - doesn't actually take up any space right that's 
why this text label is Shifting up so this is  
08:12 - transitioning in and out of view whereas this one 
is simply just hiding it it's still there but you  
08:18 - just can't see it and there's an animation 
associated with that so disappear is sort  
08:25 - of the same thing I can show you what that looks 
like if we change the symbol effect to disappear
08:35 - all right
08:40 - so it's really hard to tell to be honest 
but there is an animation when it disappears  
08:47 - and actually later when we take a look at the 
SF symbols app there's a way to preview all of  
08:52 - these symbol effects before you choose to use the 
symbol so it actually might be easier to preview  
08:58 - it there and see if that's what you want before 
actually writing the code okay let's take a look  
09:03 - at replace this is the last one that we're going 
to go through and this is a Content transition so  
09:09 - again it's applied differently as well so here 
is the symbol and you can see the symbol that  
09:15 - I use depends on this Boolean is paused was 
it which is initially set to false and that's  
09:22 - why it's showing the play button but when I 
tap on this button it's going to toggle that  
09:27 - Boolean and then it's going to change it to 
a different symbol it's going to change it to  
09:31 - the pause symbol and it's going to go between 
play and pause each time I tap on the button  
09:36 - here I applied a Content transition modifier 
with the symbol effect replace so then there  
09:42 - is an animation that happens between the two 
symbols if we didn't have this it would just  
09:53 - sort of flip between you see that no 
animation it just changes instantaneously
10:01 - whereas this one has a little nice animation like 
that very easy to apply you can also tweak symbol  
10:09 - effects like this the best way to experiment with 
this is actually to download the SF symbols Mac  
10:15 - app and on this page you can find the beta for 
this which is what you're going to have to use at  
10:21 - the time of this recording now using that app if 
you select the icon that you want let's say this  
10:26 - one and you go into this tab right here which is 
the animation tab you can preview the animation so  
10:35 - let's take a look at this so that's how it's 
going to look okay but if you do iterative  
10:43 - you can see it looks a little different and if 
you hit hide you can see it looks very different  
10:50 - reversing lets it go backwards cumulative 
let it's sort of like an additive effect
11:00 - so then once you've customized it the 
way you want with these options you can  
11:04 - choose this button to copy that configuration 
and then you can go into your xcode project  
11:11 - and let's say we're going to apply it to that was 
the variable color one right so we can apply it
11:24 - variable color iterative hide 
inactive layers reversing
11:32 - so then that's what it's going to look 
like now I'll be honest in the dub dub  
11:36 - 23 video where I learned this stuff Link 
in the description below they showed the  
11:41 - coolest symbols with the coolest effects in 
reality most of the symbols don't have such  
11:45 - detailed effects however I'm still really happy 
with how easy it is to just make your UI feel  
11:51 - responsive and alive so what do you think about 
symbol effects will you be using them in your  
11:56 - app let me know by leaving a comment below 
and if you're brand new to app development  
11:59 - check out our three hour beginner Master Class 
where you can learn Swift UI and build your  
12:04 - first app no experience required thanks for 
watching and I'll see you in the next video
