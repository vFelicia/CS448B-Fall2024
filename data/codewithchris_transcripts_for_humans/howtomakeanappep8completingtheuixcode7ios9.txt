00:05 - hey guys welcome to lesson eight of how
00:08 - to make iphone apps with no programming
00:09 - experience in this lesson we're going to
00:12 - complete our user interface by adding
00:15 - the second card image view a background
00:17 - image view in the deal button all
00:19 - utilizing the auto layout constraint and
00:21 - size class concepts that we learned in
00:24 - the previous lessons now that you know
00:28 - the basics of auto layout constraints
00:30 - and size classes this part is going to
00:32 - be pretty easy for you so what I'm going
00:34 - to do is drag another one another image
00:38 - view onto the view but what you can also
00:40 - do delete this for now what you can also
00:43 - do is click your image view press
00:46 - command D to duplicate it and you can
00:48 - see here I've got another copy of it but
00:51 - what I would do first and foremost is go
00:54 - over to the document outline here it's
00:56 - named the same way so I would highlight
01:00 - that and press ENTER and then change
01:03 - that name just so it doesn't get too
01:05 - confusing so as you can see it also
01:08 - copied the sizing constraints because
01:10 - the sizing constraints are part of the
01:12 - actual element however it did not copy
01:15 - the positioning constraints so we're
01:17 - going to have to add those so what I'm
01:19 - going to do is click the second card
01:24 - open up the alignment menu vertically
01:28 - Center in the container and then I'm
01:31 - missing an x position constraint but
01:34 - remember I want it to be 50 from the
01:36 - right edge on portrait size classes and
01:41 - I want to be 150 from the right edge on
01:44 - landscape size classes so now I'm going
01:47 - to go into the specific size classes so
01:49 - I'm gonna go do this one for all iPhones
01:52 - in portrait and actually I don't even
01:55 - see my card so where is that let's go
02:00 - resolve Auto that constraints update
02:02 - frames no there it is it's right over
02:05 - top so make sure that you've selected
02:10 - second card if you're not sure which is
02:12 - second card
02:14 - go here in the document outline just
02:16 - select it from here so you're sure
02:18 - select second card go to this pin menu
02:24 - uncheck constraint margins enable the
02:27 - right margin this time select 50 press
02:30 - tab and then add one constraint so now
02:34 - let's update frames and there we go this
02:38 - is only in the portrait size class
02:40 - remember so now we're going to jump over
02:42 - to the landscape size class and again my
02:47 - second card is probably over top this
02:50 - one so I'm gonna select second card and
02:54 - go back to the pin menu uncheck
02:57 - constrain - margins enable the right
03:00 - margin and this time we're gonna set to
03:02 - 150 press tab add one constraint click
03:07 - this button and go update frames let's
03:11 - give this guy nobody he's got a
03:13 - background too so now let's command R to
03:17 - run the project and we are gonna see
03:19 - both cards like that so there we go next
03:28 - we're going to add a button so I am
03:32 - going to go back to the any width in any
03:36 - height size class now I'm going to
03:40 - search for button down here
03:48 - and in this size class Xcode complains
03:51 - about this second card imageview not
03:55 - having a an exposition constraint but
03:58 - I'm just going to ignore that because I
03:59 - know in the specific size classes I do
04:03 - have those constraints okay so this is
04:06 - my button I'm going to select the button
04:09 - I'm going to go up here and change the
04:13 - title to deal and I am also going to set
04:18 - some constraints for this guy so
04:21 - remember I'm in the any within any
04:23 - height size class I'm going to
04:26 - horizontally Center it but in terms of
04:31 - where it is vertically from the bottom
04:34 - of the screen I'm going to make that
04:36 - specific to whether it's important or
04:38 - landscape so again I'm going to jump
04:40 - into the portrait size class so you can
04:44 - see my deal button is way off there but
04:48 - I'm going to highlight it I'm gonna go
04:50 - into the pin menu
04:52 - you know uncheck constrain to margins
04:54 - I'm gonna enable the bottom constraint
04:57 - I'm gonna say 200 add one constraint
05:04 - okay now I'm going to click this button
05:07 - and update frames so there's my deal
05:10 - button for the portrait orientation I'm
05:13 - gonna jump into the landscape one and
05:16 - you can see my button is way down here I
05:18 - can't even see it can't click it but I
05:21 - can click the button from the document
05:23 - outline so I'm going to select it from
05:25 - the document outline like this I'm gonna
05:28 - go into the pin menu uncheck constraint
05:31 - margins enable the bottom margin and now
05:34 - I'm going to say 50 press tab add one
05:39 - constraint actually you can also select
05:42 - this drop down update all frames and
05:46 - containers and then click Add constraint
05:48 - and it's going to add that constraint
05:50 - and then update all of the views so you
05:53 - don't have to go here and update frames
05:54 - from this button here so you remember to
05:57 - do that you save a step okay so now
05:59 - we've got our deal button and let's
06:01 - how it looks by running our app pressing
06:04 - command R okay so we've got our button
06:11 - right there that might be a little too
06:13 - high in portrait so we can change that
06:15 - and there's the button in the landscape
06:18 - view so I'm just gonna adjust it in
06:22 - portrait to something else let's jump
06:26 - into portrait really quickly I'm gonna
06:29 - select that constraint and instead of
06:32 - 200 here I'm just gonna say 150 and it
06:36 - lets at the background so let's search
06:39 - here for image view before we add it to
06:42 - the view however make sure you change it
06:44 - back to any width in any height because
06:46 - you want that background to be visible
06:49 - on any within any height if you only add
06:52 - it to this size class then it's only
06:54 - gonna show up in portrait mode so I'm
06:57 - gonna go back to any within any height
06:59 - I'm gonna just drag the image view here
07:02 - so what we're going to do is we're going
07:04 - to add constraints for this background
07:07 - so go into the pin menu and I'm going to
07:12 - uncheck constraint to margins what we're
07:15 - going to do is enable all four margins
07:18 - but you got to be careful here because
07:20 - of the spacing says spacing to the
07:22 - nearest neighbor now this image view for
07:26 - this right margin you may think that if
07:28 - I set this to zero it's going to be
07:31 - flush against the right edge right but
07:33 - that's in fact not true because that
07:36 - spacing is relative to the nearest
07:38 - neighbor and the nearest neighbor for
07:40 - this image view is actually this 2nd
07:42 - card image view if you click this little
07:45 - drop down arrow here you can see it's
07:48 - going to be positioned zero against the
07:52 - the left edge of this second card
07:55 - instead I want to change this to the
07:57 - view okay and change that to zero so
08:00 - just double check that pull down the
08:02 - drop down make sure it says view and
08:04 - when you do that it changes the number
08:06 - on you but enter zero same for this one
08:10 - I'm going to change it to be relative to
08:13 - the view and not the bottom layout guide
08:15 - change that to zero here that's fine and
08:19 - for the top margin I'm going to say vo
08:23 - and not the top layout guide because I
08:26 - want the background to stretch even up
08:29 - to the top edge of the screen even if
08:31 - it's the status bar so I'm going to go
08:33 - view I'm gonna hit zero and press tab
08:35 - now I'm going to add these four
08:37 - constraints I'm gonna click this little
08:39 - button here and update frames and then
08:42 - you can see that my image views here all
08:45 - got miss position and my button got miss
08:48 - position too because remember in this
08:49 - any width and any height size class we
08:52 - haven't positioned the the two card
08:55 - views for the x-axis and this deal
08:57 - button doesn't have any sort of position
09:00 - on the y-axis we added those constraints
09:03 - in the specific portrait size class in
09:06 - the landscape size class but you're
09:08 - going to see when we run the app that's
09:10 - going to work out right now we have to
09:13 - add a background to the image view
09:14 - because we actually can't see anything
09:16 - without an image so I'm gonna add this
09:21 - pink background for my background image
09:23 - view and then in the document outline
09:25 - I'm going to rename this to background
09:27 - now I'm going to run the app by pressing
09:31 - command R so now we've got this pink
09:33 - background that's covering all of our
09:35 - elements but we can fix that let's go
09:37 - back into our storyboard and you see how
09:41 - all of these elements we've got the
09:46 - first card the second card the deal
09:48 - button in the background well the
09:49 - background is over top everything right
09:51 - all we have to do is grab the background
09:55 - here click and drag it all the way up
09:58 - there so it's the element that is
10:02 - sitting behind all of these other guys
10:04 - now if we run it we're going to see that
10:07 - the background will be behind all of the
10:09 - elements ok so there we go so now we got
10:16 - the basis of our user interface what we
10:19 - can do now is remove the colors from
10:22 - these elements so that they're back to
10:25 - the default State so we're going to
10:26 - select my background
10:28 - and change it back to default select the
10:30 - first card change the background back to
10:32 - default select the second card and
10:35 - change the background back to default
10:37 - now when you run it you can't see
10:39 - anything but in subsequent lessons will
10:41 - be adding images to these image views

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to lesson eight of how to make iphone apps with no programming experience in this lesson we're going to complete our user interface by adding the second card image view a background image view in the deal button all utilizing the auto layout constraint and size class concepts that we learned in the previous lessons now that you know the basics of auto layout constraints and size classes this part is going to be pretty easy for you so what I'm going to do is drag another one another image view onto the view but what you can also do delete this for now what you can also do is click your image view press command D to duplicate it and you can see here I've got another copy of it but what I would do first and foremost is go over to the document outline here it's named the same way so I would highlight that and press ENTER and then change that name just so it doesn't get too confusing so as you can see it also copied the sizing constraints because the sizing constraints are part of the actual element however it did not copy the positioning constraints so we're going to have to add those so what I'm going to do is click the second card open up the alignment menu vertically Center in the container and then I'm missing an x position constraint but remember I want it to be 50 from the right edge on portrait size classes and I want to be 150 from the right edge on landscape size classes so now I'm going to go into the specific size classes so I'm gonna go do this one for all iPhones in portrait and actually I don't even see my card so where is that let's go resolve Auto that constraints update frames no there it is it's right over top so make sure that you've selected second card if you're not sure which is second card go here in the document outline just select it from here so you're sure select second card go to this pin menu uncheck constraint margins enable the right margin this time select 50 press tab and then add one constraint so now let's update frames and there we go this is only in the portrait size class remember so now we're going to jump over to the landscape size class and again my second card is probably over top this one so I'm gonna select second card and go back to the pin menu uncheck constrain margins enable the right margin and this time we're gonna set to 150 press tab add one constraint click this button and go update frames let's give this guy nobody he's got a background too so now let's command R to run the project and we are gonna see both cards like that so there we go next we're going to add a button so I am going to go back to the any width in any height size class now I'm going to search for button down here and in this size class Xcode complains about this second card imageview not having a an exposition constraint but I'm just going to ignore that because I know in the specific size classes I do have those constraints okay so this is my button I'm going to select the button I'm going to go up here and change the title to deal and I am also going to set some constraints for this guy so remember I'm in the any within any height size class I'm going to horizontally Center it but in terms of where it is vertically from the bottom of the screen I'm going to make that specific to whether it's important or landscape so again I'm going to jump into the portrait size class so you can see my deal button is way off there but I'm going to highlight it I'm gonna go into the pin menu you know uncheck constrain to margins I'm gonna enable the bottom constraint I'm gonna say 200 add one constraint okay now I'm going to click this button and update frames so there's my deal button for the portrait orientation I'm gonna jump into the landscape one and you can see my button is way down here I can't even see it can't click it but I can click the button from the document outline so I'm going to select it from the document outline like this I'm gonna go into the pin menu uncheck constraint margins enable the bottom margin and now I'm going to say 50 press tab add one constraint actually you can also select this drop down update all frames and containers and then click Add constraint and it's going to add that constraint and then update all of the views so you don't have to go here and update frames from this button here so you remember to do that you save a step okay so now we've got our deal button and let's how it looks by running our app pressing command R okay so we've got our button right there that might be a little too high in portrait so we can change that and there's the button in the landscape view so I'm just gonna adjust it in portrait to something else let's jump into portrait really quickly I'm gonna select that constraint and instead of 200 here I'm just gonna say 150 and it lets at the background so let's search here for image view before we add it to the view however make sure you change it back to any width in any height because you want that background to be visible on any within any height if you only add it to this size class then it's only gonna show up in portrait mode so I'm gonna go back to any within any height I'm gonna just drag the image view here so what we're going to do is we're going to add constraints for this background so go into the pin menu and I'm going to uncheck constraint to margins what we're going to do is enable all four margins but you got to be careful here because of the spacing says spacing to the nearest neighbor now this image view for this right margin you may think that if I set this to zero it's going to be flush against the right edge right but that's in fact not true because that spacing is relative to the nearest neighbor and the nearest neighbor for this image view is actually this 2nd card image view if you click this little drop down arrow here you can see it's going to be positioned zero against the the left edge of this second card instead I want to change this to the view okay and change that to zero so just double check that pull down the drop down make sure it says view and when you do that it changes the number on you but enter zero same for this one I'm going to change it to be relative to the view and not the bottom layout guide change that to zero here that's fine and for the top margin I'm going to say vo and not the top layout guide because I want the background to stretch even up to the top edge of the screen even if it's the status bar so I'm going to go view I'm gonna hit zero and press tab now I'm going to add these four constraints I'm gonna click this little button here and update frames and then you can see that my image views here all got miss position and my button got miss position too because remember in this any width and any height size class we haven't positioned the the two card views for the xaxis and this deal button doesn't have any sort of position on the yaxis we added those constraints in the specific portrait size class in the landscape size class but you're going to see when we run the app that's going to work out right now we have to add a background to the image view because we actually can't see anything without an image so I'm gonna add this pink background for my background image view and then in the document outline I'm going to rename this to background now I'm going to run the app by pressing command R so now we've got this pink background that's covering all of our elements but we can fix that let's go back into our storyboard and you see how all of these elements we've got the first card the second card the deal button in the background well the background is over top everything right all we have to do is grab the background here click and drag it all the way up there so it's the element that is sitting behind all of these other guys now if we run it we're going to see that the background will be behind all of the elements ok so there we go so now we got the basis of our user interface what we can do now is remove the colors from these elements so that they're back to the default State so we're going to select my background and change it back to default select the first card change the background back to default select the second card and change the background back to default now when you run it you can't see anything but in subsequent lessons will be adding images to these image views
