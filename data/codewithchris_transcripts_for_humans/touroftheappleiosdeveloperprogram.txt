00:06 - hey guys welcome to this video I'm going
00:09 - to do a quick introduction on the iOS
00:11 - developer program which Apple offers for
00:14 - $99 a year so what is this program well
00:18 - it allows you to do several things the
00:21 - first thing is to get access to beta
00:23 - software such as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 right
00:27 - now gives you access to some community
00:31 - developer forums but most importantly it
00:33 - gives you the ability to deploy your
00:36 - apps that you write on actual real
00:39 - devices and this is the only way to do
00:41 - it you have to be enrolled in this
00:42 - program in order to put your apps on
00:45 - real devices otherwise you can test then
00:48 - you build your apps on the simulator all
00:51 - you want without enrolling in this
00:53 - program that's fine and lastly it also
00:56 - allows you to submit apps into the App
00:59 - Store which is important to some people
01:01 - and but I just wanted to do a quick kind
01:04 - of like a tour and bring you into the
01:07 - program and the most important parts of
01:10 - it so let's go into the member center
01:14 - here so as you can see here you have the
01:19 - developer forums right you have
01:22 - something called iTunes Connect which is
01:25 - where you manage your app store listings
01:28 - so the general process for submitting an
01:31 - app into the App Store is you build a
01:34 - new test your app in Xcode and on the
01:36 - simulator or on a real device and after
01:38 - you've finished your app basically you
01:41 - go into iTunes Connect you create an app
01:43 - store listing for your app you fill in
01:45 - all of this metadata all this
01:47 - information like the description the
01:49 - title setting the price setting where
01:52 - it's available in what countries it's
01:55 - available setting the support URLs and
01:58 - all that stuff and then once you create
02:01 - that listing on the iTunes Connect side
02:03 - you can go back into Xcode and you can
02:05 - then submit your app from Xcode for
02:08 - approval so you submit it for approval
02:10 - but now Apple has all the information
02:13 - you submitted as
02:15 - well as the build that you submit with
02:17 - Xcode so together with all of that
02:19 - metadata information with the build
02:21 - they'll evaluate your app go through a
02:23 - review process and then when it's
02:25 - approved it gets submitted to the App
02:27 - Store so that's what iTunes Connect is
02:29 - this is equally as important so
02:32 - certificates identifiers in profiles so
02:34 - I'm going to do another video right
02:36 - after this one about deploying your app
02:39 - on actual devices and it has everything
02:42 - to do with this section so I'm just
02:44 - going to go ahead and hop into there and
02:48 - I am not part of the Mac or Safari
02:51 - program so you can't see any of that
02:53 - stuff but for iOS apps there are four
02:56 - distinct sections certificates
02:57 - identifiers devices and provisioning
02:59 - profiles so I'm not going to dive into
03:02 - what those are right now but the gist of
03:05 - it is that it's a system that identifies
03:08 - you as the creator of the app and make
03:12 - sure that the build that you put on
03:14 - people's phones hasn't been tampered
03:16 - with so that's kind of like the general
03:18 - purpose of why this system exists so in
03:21 - the next video where I show you guys how
03:23 - to deploy the app on the device I'm
03:26 - going to dive deeper into the details of
03:28 - how these four things work together so
03:31 - this is the provisioning portal and it
03:33 - comes as part of your $99 per year
03:36 - enrollment without having access to this
03:39 - stuff you're not going to be able to put
03:40 - your apps on real devices okay so I'm
03:44 - going to press back here and jump into
03:46 - iTunes Connect and you have a couple of
03:52 - sections here so manage your apps is
03:54 - what I mentioned earlier where you
03:56 - create your app listing and fill in the
03:59 - the metadata for your app you also have
04:02 - reporting you have sales and trends so
04:04 - it's kind of like a analytics dashboard
04:07 - for how many downloads you're getting
04:09 - how much money you're making off of your
04:11 - paid apps before you can submit paid
04:13 - apps though and before even if you want
04:16 - to do I add and monetize your apps you
04:18 - need to go into this section contracts
04:20 - tax and banking to fill to fill in your
04:24 - banking information your tax information
04:25 - and
04:26 - and some contracts that govern what you
04:28 - can and can't do with your paid apps
04:31 - payments and financial reporting I guess
04:33 - this is actually where you see your
04:35 - earnings where as sales and trends is
04:37 - more of like your actual sales and
04:39 - downloads of all of your apps and in
04:41 - manage users you can give multiple
04:43 - people access to your iTunes Connect
04:46 - dashboards so if you're a business you
04:48 - can add an account for access if someone
04:52 - else is developing your app you can give
04:54 - them access and also for in-app
04:56 - purchases this is where you can create
04:58 - test accounts because you don't actually
05:00 - want to use your real account to test
05:02 - your in-app purchases and make real
05:04 - purchases so you can create test
05:06 - accounts here and you can select
05:08 - different different iTunes stores for
05:12 - your test accounts one person might be a
05:15 - u.s. customer one person might be a
05:17 - Canadian customer and so on and so forth
05:20 - manager apps is where you actually
05:22 - create your app listings and you can
05:24 - edit your app listings as well this is a
05:27 - add section there's basically a bunch of
05:30 - documentation in there for how to
05:31 - integrate Ayad whether you're on the
05:33 - publisher side or the advertiser side
05:36 - catalog reports I'm not really sure what
05:39 - it is I've never really used it support
05:43 - I haven't had to use support either
05:45 - that's pretty pretty self-explanatory
05:47 - all of this stuff so that's kind of like
05:50 - at a general tour of the developer
05:53 - program definitely worth the $99 a year
05:56 - if you plan to submit some apps to the
05:59 - store so in the following video I'll
06:01 - dive a little deeper into the
06:03 - certificates identifiers and profiles
06:05 - and I will show you guys and how to how
06:10 - to set everything up to deploy an app on
06:12 - a real device okay I'll talk to you guys
06:14 - later bye
06:22 - you

hey guys welcome to this video I'm going to do a quick introduction on the iOS developer program which Apple offers for $99 a year so what is this program well it allows you to do several things the

apps on the simulator all you want without enrolling in this program that's fine and lastly it also allows you to submit apps into the App Store which is important to some people and but I just wanted to do a quick kind of like a tour and bring you into the program and the most important parts of it so let's go into the member center here so as you can see here you have the developer forums right you have something called iTunes Connect which is where you manage your app store listings so the general process for submitting an app into the App Store is you build a new test your app in Xcode and

as well as the build that you submit with Xcode so together with all of that metadata information with the build they'll evaluate your app go through a review process and then when it's approved it gets submitted to the App Store so that's what iTunes Connect is this is equally as important so certificates identifiers in profiles so I'm going to do another video right after this one about deploying your app on actual devices and it has everything to do with this section so I'm just going to go ahead and hop into there and I am not part of the Mac or Safari program so you can't see any
