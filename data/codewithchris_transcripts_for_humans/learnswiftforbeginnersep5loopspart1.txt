00:00 - hello welcome to learn twist for
00:02 - beginners lesson 5 in today's lesson
00:04 - we're going to talk about loops when
00:06 - you're writing your app there is going
00:08 - to be many times you're going to find
00:10 - yourself needing to repeat pieces of
00:12 - code for instance let's say you're
00:15 - showing five things in your app and you
00:18 - need to turn each of them red so a loop
00:20 - is going to allow you to just write that
00:23 - single line of code to turn something
00:25 - red and you can repeat it five times for
00:28 - each of those five objects and that's
00:31 - going to save you from having to write
00:33 - out that code five times so that's a
00:36 - very simplified example let's me you're
00:39 - going to use them a lot so let's take a
00:41 - look at how to use them so there are
00:47 - three types of loops we're going to
00:49 - cover today we're going to start with
00:50 - the for in loop as you can see in the
00:54 - Swift programming guide here so let's go
00:57 - ahead and start a new playground in our
01:00 - Xcode and I'm just going to call this
01:04 - the loop playground and save it on my
01:08 - desktop now a four in loop allows you to
01:14 - repeat a piece of code a certain
01:17 - specified number of times if you have a
01:20 - list of data otherwise known as an array
01:22 - which you're going to learn about in an
01:24 - upcoming lesson you can also use a for
01:27 - in loop to go through each of those
01:29 - pieces of data in that array and execute
01:33 - some sort of code on it so this is
01:35 - perfect for the example we mentioned in
01:37 - the intro about having five objects or
01:40 - five items on the screen and you need to
01:42 - turn each of them red for example so
01:45 - let's start with learning how to use a
01:47 - four end loop to repeat a piece of code
01:50 - for a specified number of times and when
01:52 - you guys learn about arrays I'll show
01:55 - you how to use a for loop to go through
01:57 - each piece of data in that array so as
02:00 - you can see true to its name the key
02:03 - words to use here are four and in so you
02:07 - start with the keyword four and next you
02:10 - have a variable name now you don't have
02:13 - to
02:13 - this variable using the VAR keyword like
02:16 - you've learned in the previous lessons
02:18 - you can simply have a name for this
02:21 - variable because you're only going to
02:23 - refer to this variable within the for in
02:26 - loop this variable that you specify here
02:29 - is going to keep track of which
02:31 - iteration of the loop is currently
02:33 - running next up you have the keyword in
02:35 - and then you have the lower range
02:39 - followed by dot dot dot and then the
02:42 - upper range and that last part there
02:44 - after the in keyword is the range which
02:48 - your for loop is going to run in and
02:51 - it's inclusive of those numbers so for
02:54 - example if you have one dot dot dot five
02:57 - it's actually going to run five times
02:59 - and then after that you open a set of
03:02 - curly brackets and inside the set of
03:05 - curly brackets that's where you're going
03:06 - to put the code that you want to repeat
03:09 - for that number of times so let's jump
03:11 - back to the playground and let's do a
03:14 - quick demo on for in loop so I have the
03:18 - four keyword here and for my variable I
03:21 - can specify something like index and
03:25 - then I would put in and let's use that
03:28 - same example one two five and then I
03:31 - open up a set of curly brackets and then
03:34 - here I'm simply going to print hello and
03:39 - we're going to see this in the console
03:40 - down here it is printed at five times
03:44 - now part of the reason why you specify a
03:48 - variable name here called index is
03:50 - because you want to use that that number
03:54 - or this variable inside your for loop
03:57 - here so for example I can do something
04:02 - like this or I can say print index and
04:06 - you're going to see that index changes
04:09 - from one two three four five depending
04:13 - on which iteration of the loop it is it
04:16 - keeps track of basically where we're at
04:19 - in this range right here as we're
04:22 - looping through it but again what we've
04:25 - specified here is a count
04:27 - is only available inside the scope here
04:30 - in between these curly brackets I can't
04:33 - specify you know printing index out here
04:38 - it's not going to recognize it
04:40 - okay so we can't do that and furthermore
04:45 - if you don't need to use index inside
04:48 - your for loop you can very simply place
04:51 - an underscore there so this is perfect
04:54 - for the example that we had initially
04:58 - where we're just printing hello five
05:00 - times we don't really need a counter of
05:03 - any sort where we don't need to refer to
05:05 - index we don't care which iteration is
05:08 - currently at one thing I want to mention
05:11 - which is confusing often for beginners
05:14 - is this idea of scope here for example
05:19 - if I wanted to sum up the numbers from
05:21 - one to five and I wanted to print out
05:23 - the result after the for loop let's say
05:26 - I declare a variable up here and I call
05:28 - it sum right equate it to zero and then
05:32 - I say something like sum plus equals and
05:37 - actually let's add this index variable
05:41 - back here and I go like this now you
05:44 - haven't seen this plus equals sign yet
05:48 - but this operator basically equates to
05:51 - something like this it takes some and it
05:57 - adds the index so this is equivalent to
06:00 - writing this is just kind of like a
06:04 - short form okay so first of all if I
06:08 - declare this variable called sum is
06:11 - inside my for loop inside these curly
06:13 - brackets
06:14 - well this variable is only available
06:16 - within that scope within these two curly
06:20 - brackets I can't go out here outside of
06:23 - the for loop after it's run five times
06:25 - and print out the result of some see you
06:30 - can see that it can't find this variable
06:33 - even though I've declared it in here
06:36 - okay so why don't we move this print
06:39 - statement
06:40 - to the for-loop what would you expect to
06:43 - happen in this case well we get one two
06:46 - three four five again and why is it that
06:50 - this sum isn't increasing why isn't it
06:53 - continually adding index to it and you
06:57 - know why aren't I getting the sum of the
07:00 - numbers from one to five by the last
07:02 - iteration of the loop well what's
07:04 - happening is that in the first iteration
07:07 - of the loop we're declaring some equals
07:11 - to zero and then we're adding index to
07:15 - sum which is one and then we're printing
07:18 - some so that's why we get one down here
07:19 - in the second iteration of the loop what
07:22 - we're doing is we're declaring some
07:24 - again we're setting it to zero and we
07:27 - are adding this time the index is 2 and
07:30 - we're adding two to zero right and then
07:32 - it's going to print two so that's why
07:35 - you can see the output two right there
07:38 - well right now you might point out to me
07:40 - hey Chris I thought you said that you
07:42 - can't read it clear the same variable
07:44 - you know in the first iteration of the
07:46 - loop we're declaring var sum right and
07:50 - then in the second iteration of the loop
07:51 - weari declaring var sum that's that's
07:54 - illegal that's not allowed in fact you
07:56 - might say that you know if I declare var
07:59 - string again up here it's going to throw
08:02 - an error all right we can't read Eclair
08:04 - the same variable because we've declared
08:07 - this guy up here we can't read Eclair
08:09 - using the bar again and I would say
08:12 - that's true except that in each
08:15 - iteration of the loop
08:17 - it's almost as if it doesn't remember
08:20 - what happened in the previous iteration
08:22 - there's no memory or recollection of the
08:25 - previous iteration
08:26 - so each iteration is kind of like a
08:28 - clean slate and it's going to execute
08:30 - this code right here so just to say that
08:34 - again you're right if you're saying that
08:37 - I can't read Eclair some right because
08:41 - if I try to do that right here Xcode
08:44 - would throw an error however inside of a
08:48 - loop in this scope right here
08:51 - each iteration of the loop is like a
08:53 - clean slate okay now if I wanted to
08:57 - actually find out the sum of the numbers
09:01 - from one to five what I would actually
09:03 - do is I would move this declaration up
09:06 - here outside of the loop and then what I
09:10 - would do this way I could move this
09:15 - print statement outside of the loop and
09:17 - what this foreign loop will do is simply
09:20 - loop from one to five each time adding
09:24 - index to the sum and now I'm actually
09:27 - keeping track of the sum so you can see
09:29 - that after five iterations of the loop
09:32 - adding the numbers from one to five into
09:35 - sum which started out as zero the result
09:40 - is 15 down here and that's from this
09:43 - print statement okay so I'm going to
09:46 - stop the lesson there while the syntax
09:49 - for the foreign loop is actually pretty
09:51 - simple and in the concept of repeating a
09:54 - piece of code for a certain number of
09:56 - time is pretty simple I want to give you
09:58 - some breathing room to digest what we
10:01 - talked about in regards to the variable
10:03 - scope so I would recommend that you try
10:07 - declaring and creating this loop on your
10:10 - own computer try declaring the variables
10:12 - inside the loop and outside the loop and
10:14 - see where you can access them and use
10:16 - them and where you cannot and it's
10:18 - really going to help and aid you in your
10:20 - learning if you like this lesson please
10:23 - give the video thumbs up and subscribe
10:25 - to channel it's going to help the
10:26 - channel gain some more exposure and
10:28 - visibility and it's really going to help
10:31 - me out so thanks a lot for watching and
10:33 - I'll see you in the next lesson bye for
10:35 - now
10:37 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to learn twist for beginners lesson 5 in today's lesson we're going to talk about loops when you're writing your app there is going to be many times you're going to find yourself needing to repeat pieces of code for instance let's say you're showing five things in your app and you need to turn each of them red so a loop is going to allow you to just write that single line of code to turn something red and you can repeat it five times for each of those five objects and that's going to save you from having to write out that code five times so that's a very simplified example let's me you're going to use them a lot so let's take a look at how to use them so there are three types of loops we're going to cover today we're going to start with the for in loop as you can see in the Swift programming guide here so let's go ahead and start a new playground in our Xcode and I'm just going to call this the loop playground and save it on my desktop now a four in loop allows you to repeat a piece of code a certain specified number of times if you have a list of data otherwise known as an array which you're going to learn about in an upcoming lesson you can also use a for in loop to go through each of those pieces of data in that array and execute some sort of code on it so this is perfect for the example we mentioned in the intro about having five objects or five items on the screen and you need to turn each of them red for example so let's start with learning how to use a four end loop to repeat a piece of code for a specified number of times and when you guys learn about arrays I'll show you how to use a for loop to go through each piece of data in that array so as you can see true to its name the key words to use here are four and in so you start with the keyword four and next you have a variable name now you don't have to this variable using the VAR keyword like you've learned in the previous lessons you can simply have a name for this variable because you're only going to refer to this variable within the for in loop this variable that you specify here is going to keep track of which iteration of the loop is currently running next up you have the keyword in and then you have the lower range followed by dot dot dot and then the upper range and that last part there after the in keyword is the range which your for loop is going to run in and it's inclusive of those numbers so for example if you have one dot dot dot five it's actually going to run five times and then after that you open a set of curly brackets and inside the set of curly brackets that's where you're going to put the code that you want to repeat for that number of times so let's jump back to the playground and let's do a quick demo on for in loop so I have the four keyword here and for my variable I can specify something like index and then I would put in and let's use that same example one two five and then I open up a set of curly brackets and then here I'm simply going to print hello and we're going to see this in the console down here it is printed at five times now part of the reason why you specify a variable name here called index is because you want to use that that number or this variable inside your for loop here so for example I can do something like this or I can say print index and you're going to see that index changes from one two three four five depending on which iteration of the loop it is it keeps track of basically where we're at in this range right here as we're looping through it but again what we've specified here is a

what would you expect to happen in this case well we get one two three four five again and why is it that this sum isn't increasing why isn't it continually adding index to it and you know why aren't

time adding index to the sum and now I'm actually keeping track of the sum so you can see that after five iterations of the loop adding the numbers from one to five into sum which started out as zero the result is 15 down here and that's from this print statement okay so I'm going to stop the lesson there while the syntax for the foreign loop is actually pretty simple and in the concept of repeating a piece of code for a certain number of time is pretty simple I want to give you some breathing room to digest what we talked about in regards to the variable scope so I would recommend that
