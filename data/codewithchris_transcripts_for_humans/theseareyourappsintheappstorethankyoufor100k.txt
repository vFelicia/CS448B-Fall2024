00:00 - hey coke root what's up it's Chris here
00:01 - if you've watched any of my other
00:03 - YouTube videos you'll know that this is
00:05 - usually the wall that I stand in front
00:06 - of and today I think it's time to
00:08 - finally take down this ugly audio foam
00:11 - it used to be a nice maroon light gray
00:14 - kind of color but as you can see over
00:16 - time it hasn't aged well at all so I had
00:20 - this great idea which i think is going
00:22 - to look really cool for the background
00:24 - and what it is I went to Ikea and I
00:26 - bought these photo frames and I thought
00:29 - it would look really cool if I print it
00:31 - off all of the apps that you guys have
00:32 - submitted over time and kind of print
00:35 - off the app icons and put them into the
00:37 - frame and then put them up into the wall
00:38 - so it's going to appear in every single
00:41 - one of the YouTube videos that I create
00:43 - now that being said if for some reason
00:46 - you don't want your app icon shown in
00:47 - the frame no problem just let me know
00:49 - and I'll take it out and on the flipside
00:51 - if you have submitted an app to the App
00:54 - Store and published it and I in some way
00:56 - have helped you to do that please let me
00:58 - know I'd love to feature your app in
01:01 - these frames and they're gonna appear in
01:04 - all of my youtube videos so the thing is
01:06 - I don't think I have enough app icons
01:09 - right now to fill up three or four of
01:10 - these frames however I do have some
01:13 - artwork that I'm also going to put up in
01:15 - the meantime just to fill the wall let
01:17 - me show you that so some of you guys
01:19 - might recognize this as Mancos angle
01:22 - product and basically vector mock-ups of
01:26 - devices that you can use for like
01:28 - marketing collateral and all that sort
01:30 - of stuff but I decided to print it off
01:32 - and use it as artwork because it really
01:34 - does look very cool and shout out to
01:37 - Mancos design code dot IO courses and
01:41 - the angle product go check it out there
01:43 - you can grab the angle products if you
01:46 - want or sign up for any of his design
01:48 - courses I highly recommend them I've
01:50 - taken them myself all right so why don't
01:53 - we go and cut up the app icons and then
01:55 - put up the frames and take a look at how
01:57 - they look
02:01 - [Music]
02:32 - hey guys so what do you think I
02:34 - personally really really like it now
02:36 - there is some reflection off of the
02:38 - windows on the frames but I'm gonna
02:40 - remove the gloss and so that should
02:41 - solve the problem now I think this is
02:43 - really awesome but I know there is one
02:45 - tiny detail that is gonna make this so
02:47 - much better come with me alright so I've
02:51 - got this package and I got it a while
02:53 - back but I've really been waiting to
