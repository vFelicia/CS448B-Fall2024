00:05 - hey guys welcome to this video where I'm
00:08 - going to show you how to find the
00:10 - detailed error message when your app
00:12 - crashes and that's gonna help you figure
00:15 - out what's going wrong with your project
00:17 - because a lot of the time when it
00:19 - crashes you get this green line
00:21 - highlighting something in your code
00:23 - saying cig abort or you know some other
00:27 - cryptic error message and it just
00:30 - doesn't mean very much so let me create
00:32 - a crash right now and I will show you
00:36 - guys how to figure that out alright so
00:38 - I've got an existing project here and
00:41 - I'm just going to comment out a line of
00:43 - code which I know will cause the app to
00:45 - crash and I'm gonna run it by pressing
00:47 - command R and this is going to build my
00:50 - project it's gonna launch the iOS
00:53 - simulator and then it's gonna run my
00:55 - project on that simulator so there it
00:59 - goes and fully expecting this to crash
01:14 - all right so there it goes and it's
01:17 - going into my app delegate which is the
01:21 - entry point for my app and I have this
01:23 - error message on the right here which
01:25 - says cig abort and that's not very
01:28 - meaningful and sometimes it can't
01:32 - highlight exactly the line that's going
01:35 - wrong it just knows that something is
01:37 - wrong and it's crashed but where do you
01:40 - want to pay attention to is down here in
01:42 - the debug area if you watched my Xcode
01:44 - user interface walkthrough you'll know
01:47 - that this area is for troubleshooting
01:49 - your code if you don't see this area
01:51 - under your code editor go to the upper
01:54 - right hand corner and make sure you have
01:57 - this button toggled on this button hides
02:00 - or shows that the bug area and if you
02:02 - still want to see it take note that in
02:04 - the debug area you have these two
02:06 - buttons here which you can hide and show
02:09 - the left the right side of the debug
02:11 - area so make sure that the right hand
02:14 - side is visible so you see all of this
02:16 - text so what you want to do when it
02:19 - crashes is right here at the very bottom
02:23 - this is not the well this is an error
02:26 - message but it's just telling you that
02:29 - it crashed so what you want to do is you
02:32 - want to scroll all the way up usually
02:38 - what happens is you're going to find the
02:41 - source of the crash so it tells you that
02:45 - the view hierarchy is not prepared for
02:47 - the constraint and it basically gives
02:51 - you a little more detailed information
02:54 - about your crash now the crash that you
02:56 - have may not have this exact message
02:59 - because depending on why it's crashing
03:02 - you're gonna get some different message
03:05 - here but it's a lot more helpful to read
03:06 - this message here because it's usually
03:08 - more detailed and it usually tells you
03:10 - the source of the problem so here for
03:13 - this particular instance it's telling me
03:15 - exactly what is wrong it's telling me
03:16 - that in here I'm trying to add all of
03:20 - these auto layout constraints but I
03:22 - haven't added the object to the view and
03:25 - if you've worked with auto layout
03:26 - constraints before
03:28 - you'll know that you have to add that
03:30 - element to the view before you can add
03:32 - Auto layout constraints on it and
03:35 - basically that just means you have to
03:38 - add that element to the view before you
03:41 - can add the rules to position that
03:43 - element on your view when I commented
03:46 - this line out I was trying to position
03:48 - that element with these rules before
03:51 - I've even added the element to the view
03:53 - so that's what this hints at see the
03:57 - view hierarchy is not prepared for the
03:59 - constraint if you had another type of
04:01 - error like cannot find selector or
04:04 - something like that that implies it's
04:07 - trying to call a method on an element
04:09 - but it can't find that a selector is
04:11 - just another word for element and I
04:13 - think I'm going to do some future videos
04:15 - just to go through the different types
04:16 - of error messages you might encounter I
04:18 - think that would be very helpful for you
04:20 - guys but I just wanted to do this video
04:23 - to show you guys how to get the detailed
04:26 - message for your error so when you run
04:28 - into a crash and you're trying to ask
04:30 - for help whether you're posting on
04:32 - forums or you're asking me this detailed
04:36 - error message right here is the one that
04:38 - you want to quote so there you go so
04:41 - thanks for watching and I hope that was
04:43 - helpful to you guys I'll see you in the
04:45 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to this video where I'm going to show you how to find the detailed error message when your app crashes and that's gonna help you figure out what's going wrong with your project because a lot of the time when it crashes you get this green line highlighting something in your code saying cig abort or you know some other cryptic error message and it just doesn't mean very much so let me create a crash right now and I will show you guys how to figure that out alright so I've got an existing project here and I'm just going to comment out a line of code which I know will cause the app to crash and I'm gonna run it by pressing command R and this is going to build my project it's gonna launch the iOS simulator and then it's gonna run my project on that simulator so there it goes and fully expecting this to crash all right so there it goes and it's going into my app delegate which is the entry point for my app and I have this error message on the right here which says cig abort and that's not very meaningful and sometimes it can't highlight exactly the line that's going wrong it just knows that something is wrong and it's crashed but where do you want to pay attention to is down here in the debug area if you watched my Xcode user interface walkthrough you'll know that this area is for troubleshooting your code if you don't see this area under your code editor go to the upper right hand corner and make sure you have this button toggled on this button hides or shows that the bug area and if you still want to see it take note that in the debug area you have these two buttons here which you can hide and show the left the right side of the debug area so make sure that the right hand side is visible so you see all of this text so what you want to do when it crashes is right here at the very bottom this is not the well this is an error message but it's just telling you that it crashed so what you want to do is you want to scroll all the way up usually what happens is you're going to find the source of the crash so it tells you that the view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint and it basically gives you a little more detailed information about your crash now the crash that you have may not have this exact message because depending on why it's crashing you're gonna get some different message here but it's a lot more helpful to read this message here because it's usually more detailed and it usually tells you the source of the problem so here for this particular instance it's telling me exactly what is wrong it's telling me that in here I'm trying to add all of these auto layout constraints but I haven't added the object to the view and if you've worked with auto layout constraints before you'll know that you have to add that element to the view before you can add Auto layout constraints on it and basically that just means you have to add that element to the view before you can add the rules to position that element on your view when I commented this line out I was trying to position that element with these rules before I've even added the element to the view so that's what this hints at see the view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint if you had another type of error like cannot find selector or something like that that implies it's trying to call a method on an element but it can't find that a selector is just another word for element and I think I'm going to do some future videos just to go through the different types of error messages you might encounter I think that would be very helpful for you guys but I just wanted to do this video to show you guys how to get the detailed message for your error so when you run into a crash and you're trying to ask for help whether you're posting on forums or you're asking me this detailed error message right here is the one that you want to quote so there you go so thanks for watching and I hope that was helpful to you guys I'll see you in the next video
