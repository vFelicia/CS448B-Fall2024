00:05 - hey guys what's up it's Chris and this
00:07 - is the first video of my new content
00:09 - schedule in this video I'm going to show
00:11 - you guys uh what we're going to be
00:13 - building together over the next
00:15 - approximately 2 weeks uh this is a
00:17 - project which I built about a year ago
00:20 - maybe a year and a half ago now in
00:22 - Objective C but when we build it
00:24 - together uh we're going to do it in
00:26 - Swift the new programming language from
00:28 - Apple and it's basically a YouTube app
00:31 - how fitting right uh it's built to
00:33 - display YouTube videos which you can
00:35 - configure in a pist or basically uh a
00:39 - data file that is included in the
00:41 - project so I'm going to launch it right
00:43 - now on the simulator to show you guys
00:45 - what we're going to be
00:47 - building okay so at the core of the
00:50 - project is a scrollable list of videos
00:53 - so in this particular configuration uh
00:56 - these videos are from Trump's YouTube
00:58 - channel and Trump is a guy who plays
01:01 - Hearthstone a game made by blizzard he's
01:04 - actually quite popular in that Community
01:06 - quite well known um and he has really
01:09 - informative videos and entertaining
01:11 - videos so I decided to configure this
01:13 - app for his
01:15 - channel so on the left hand side you can
01:18 - open up a menu and you can scroll
01:20 - through a bunch of different playlists
01:22 - when you click that playlist it's going
01:24 - to change the videos that display here
01:26 - on the main scrollable screen uh and
01:28 - when you click into it you you get uh
01:30 - the video details so I'm going to have
01:32 - to level with you guys here this app
01:34 - isn't particularly geared towards
01:37 - beginners because there's a lot of
01:39 - things that are happening here which are
01:42 - which might be quite confusing if you're
01:44 - brand new to programming with iOS uh for
01:47 - instance all these videos in this
01:49 - scrollable list they're dynamically
01:51 - parsed from his channel it downloads a
01:53 - feed from his channel and parses the
01:56 - videos and the images and shows it here
01:58 - so it's Dynamic so when he uplo a video
02:00 - it's going to show here but that sort of
02:04 - feed parsing and feed downloading may be
02:06 - a little difficult for beginners so I'm
02:08 - probably going to show two versions I'm
02:10 - going to do a a basic type app where
02:14 - maybe you have to specifically put in
02:17 - the videos that get shown uh and then
02:19 - after I do that I'll create a I'll
02:22 - create a couple more videos for those
02:23 - that want to challenge themselves and
02:25 - try their hand at parsing the YouTube
02:28 - feed and getting the data d dynamically
02:30 - so there's going to be something for
02:31 - everyone and I'm also going to try to go
02:33 - slow and explain Concepts which I think
02:35 - are new to you guys and if any of you
02:38 - guys who are watching are students of my
02:40 - how to make an iPhone app with no
02:42 - programming experience course then I'm
02:44 - sure you guys will have no problem
02:46 - following along and implementing this
02:48 - how-to series before we begin I highly
02:51 - recommend that you go to my channel page
02:54 - scroll down and go through this series
02:57 - how to make an iPhone app with no
02:58 - programming experience first it's about
03:01 - 17 lessons long but it's going to give
03:03 - you a at least a foundation for the
03:06 - terminology that I will be using and
03:08 - some of the concepts which I explain in
03:11 - uh video
03:13 - 910 uh those who are going to give you
03:15 - the basics of the objectoriented
03:18 - programming that I won't have time to
03:20 - explain as I'm going through building
03:22 - the YouTube app and plus all of this
03:24 - Auto layout size class stuff will also
03:26 - be useful so I highly recommend that you
03:28 - go to my channel page page just type
03:30 - into your address by
03:32 - youtube.com/ codewithchris and you'll
03:35 - get to this page and then scroll down um
03:38 - and look for this playlist right here
03:41 - and go through the first 17 lessons
03:44 - first and that's going to make it a lot
03:46 - easier for you to go through this
03:47 - YouTube app
03:50 - series okay so let's get started by
03:52 - creating our xcode project here I've got
03:55 - xcode open and it's worthwhile to do a
03:58 - quick check to see what version you're
04:00 - using because if your version of xcode
04:02 - differs uh you may experience different
04:05 - results when trying to follow the
04:07 - tutorial so right here I'm using 7.1.1
04:10 - so as long as you're using 7 something
04:13 - you should be okay now what I'm going to
04:15 - do is Click create new xcode project if
04:17 - you don't have this welcome window don't
04:19 - worry you can always go up here you can
04:22 - click about xcode to see what version
04:24 - you're using and then you can go to file
04:26 - new project to also launch a new project
04:29 - which is what I'm going to do right
04:31 - now so here make sure that you're
04:35 - selecting application under iOS and
04:37 - let's start with a single View
04:39 - application which is going to start us
04:40 - off with our default basic app with only
04:44 - a single
04:45 - view next we have our project properties
04:48 - I'm going to call
04:49 - this uh YouTube app and for the
04:53 - organization name you can just put your
04:54 - name or your company if you have one
04:57 - identifier usually you're going to do
05:00 - Dot and then either your name or your
05:02 - company name and together with the
05:04 - product name you're going to have a
05:06 - unique ID for your app now this is very
05:09 - important this drop down right here
05:10 - select
05:11 - Swift and for devices select iPhone we
05:15 - won't be doing this for iPad and then
05:18 - just make sure all of these are
05:19 - unchecked because we won't be using any
05:20 - of these features now click
05:23 - next and then I'm going to save this on
05:26 - the desktop as for Source control you
05:28 - can leave that un checked as
05:34 - well all right so now we have our
05:37 - default um xcode application I'm going
05:39 - to quickly go through all of these files
05:42 - on the left hand side in this file
05:44 - navigator for the benefit of those who
05:46 - haven't really worked with xcode before
05:48 - so the first screen you have is
05:50 - presented uh to you is the project
05:53 - properties and if you click this little
05:56 - blue uh node here the root node here
05:58 - this is what you're going to see your
05:59 - project properties we don't need to
06:01 - configure anything for this right now
06:04 - instead we're going to click into the
06:06 - app delegate do Swift so this file
06:09 - basically is the entry point for your
06:11 - app it allows you to handle a couple of
06:14 - um events you can add some code to
06:17 - execute before it enters the background
06:20 - or um this one actually is after it did
06:23 - enter the background this is when it
06:25 - will come back to the foreground you
06:27 - know when you're switching in between
06:28 - apps uh and so on and so forth so this
06:31 - app delegate. Swift is just a file which
06:35 - gives you a place to put some code to
06:37 - handle these
06:39 - events now we're going to quickly jump
06:41 - over to the main.
06:43 - storyboard and here
06:45 - is let me just expand these noes here
06:48 - this view is our single View and you can
06:51 - see this gray Arrow right here denotes
06:53 - that this is the starting view for our
06:57 - application so in here um when you go
07:00 - main. storyboard this interface is
07:02 - what's called interface Builder so here
07:05 - you're going to select all of these
07:07 - elements you're going to drag buttons
07:09 - and text uh sliders and so on and you're
07:12 - going to put it onto the
07:13 - view if you don't see this Library make
07:16 - sure that you've got this button
07:19 - selected which opens up the uh this is
07:22 - what's called the inspector Pane and
07:24 - then down here if you don't see these
07:26 - elements make sure that you've got this
07:29 - tab T selected the object Library um and
07:32 - only in the
07:33 - storyboard with the object Library are
07:35 - you going to see these it doesn't matter
07:38 - if you see something like this because
07:40 - you can click this little icon here to
07:42 - change the
07:45 - view uh okay so when you add elements
07:48 - onto this view how do we control the
07:50 - elements how do we add code to it uh
07:53 - well there's another file called the
07:55 - viewcontroller.swift and just like its
07:57 - name implies this viewcontroller . Swift
08:00 - class is responsible for powering the
08:03 - view in the main. storyboard handling
08:05 - user events responding to them
08:07 - processing logic and stuff like that so
08:10 - we will be working a lot in this
08:11 - viewcontroller.swift file um next we
08:14 - have assets. xcassets and this is what
08:18 - is known as our asset Library so here we
08:21 - can add all of the images that we are
08:23 - going to use for the application and and
08:26 - if you've built an iPhone app before you
08:28 - may know that for any particular image
08:32 - asset you're going to have different
08:34 - versions for retina non-retina and even
08:37 - for the iPhone 6 Plus larger screens
08:39 - where you're going to be using 3x so the
08:42 - asset library is a good way for you to
08:44 - manage your assets then we have the
08:46 - launch screen. storyboard which gives
08:48 - you another interface Builder type of
08:50 - screen to configure your launch screen
08:54 - um this is what's going to be shown
08:55 - before your view in the main. storyboard
08:59 - so this is an opportunity for you to uh
09:03 - customize what that looks like as well
09:05 - and lastly we have the info. pist which
09:07 - is kind of like a configuration file for
09:09 - the
09:11 - application okay so that's where we're
09:12 - going to end off today I want to thank
09:14 - you for learning with me and if you're
09:16 - enjoying the series so far I would
09:18 - really appreciate it if you give me a
09:20 - like subscribe and share it with your
09:21 - co-workers and Friends okay I'll talk to
09:23 - you guys tomorrow bye

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up it's Chris and this is the first video of my new content schedule in this video I'm going to show you guys uh what we're going to be building together over the next approximately 2 weeks uh this is a project which I built about a year ago maybe a year and a half ago now in Objective C but when we build it together uh we're going to do it in Swift the new programming language

slow and explain Concepts which I think are new to you guys and if any of you guys who are watching are students of my how to make an iPhone app with no programming experience course then I'm sure you guys will have no problem following along and implementing this howto series before we begin I highly recommend that you go to my channel page scroll down and go through this series how to make an
