00:00 - in this video you're going to be
00:01 - building the user interface for our demo
00:03 - app in xcode
00:04 - after that we're going to be able to
00:06 - integrate the revenue cat sdk
00:08 - and display our in-app purchases with
00:10 - just a few snippets of code
00:12 - hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to
00:14 - code with chris the place to be if you
00:16 - want to learn how to code and build apps
00:18 - now this is lesson four of the revenue
00:20 - cat video series if you missed the
00:22 - previous lessons just check that
00:23 - playlist over there
00:24 - here's where we are in our seven step
00:26 - process
00:28 - all right let's get started all right
00:30 - now i'm going to show you how to build
00:31 - out that demo
00:32 - that you saw earlier in the beginning of
00:34 - this tutorial and i won't spend too much
00:36 - time on this because
00:38 - uh really the main point of this video
00:40 - is to show
00:41 - the revenue cat in that purchase stuff
00:43 - so i'm just gonna
00:44 - breeze through this a little bit i just
00:46 - added two graphic assets
00:48 - one for a picture paris and one for
00:52 - compass that we can use on the paywall
00:54 - screen
00:55 - so i'm going to go ahead and go in the
00:56 - main storyboard and i'm going to add
00:59 - a stack view here and i'm not going to
01:02 - explain too much about what i'm doing
01:04 - here in terms of auto layout and how the
01:06 - elements work we have a
01:07 - 29 lesson beginner series that you
01:10 - should definitely check out which would
01:11 - explain
01:12 - a lot of this stuff to you and so here
01:15 - i'm just going to
01:17 - breeze on by so let's go ahead and add a
01:21 - label
01:21 - to our stack view and this is just going
01:24 - to
01:27 - say paris and let's
01:31 - make this bold
01:37 - [Music]
01:38 - and
01:41 - we'll also make this spacing 20.
01:46 - here we're going to add the image
01:52 - this is going to be an image of
01:55 - paris and we are going to
01:59 - we're going to add a constraint to this
02:02 - image and say that
02:06 - it's got a maximum height of 400 and
02:09 - then we're going to add another label
02:11 - under that image view oops
02:14 - right here and i've got some text
02:17 - prepared for that
02:24 - we got to make it a multi-line so we can
02:26 - actually see it
02:28 - and then we've got a little subheading
02:34 - here
02:38 - city tours so we'll just
02:41 - bold that and i'm actually going to
02:44 - add some margins to this stack view
02:51 - [Music]
02:53 - i shouldn't have made it zeros all
02:54 - across
02:56 - and for this image let's make it
03:00 - aspect fill okay and then after that
03:04 - let's add another label down here
03:10 - and i've got some text prepared for that
03:16 - this is going to be multi-line
03:19 - and then finally we're going to add a
03:22 - button here
03:27 - and what we're going to do here for this
03:28 - button is
03:30 - say join pro for tours we're going to
03:34 - change the background of this button
03:38 - to let's say say indigo
03:41 - and we'll change the text color to
03:44 - white and we're going to add an image
03:47 - for map in
03:50 - in the lips let's say that
03:55 - and the tint color let's use white as
03:58 - well
04:00 - we'll add a space
04:04 - so it looks something like that that's
04:06 - the button we have
04:07 - all right now for the second screen
04:09 - there's going to be our
04:10 - paywall so i'm going to add a new con
04:14 - view controller here and
04:17 - we're going to create a new class to
04:19 - represent that so
04:20 - go ahead choose new file let's choose
04:22 - coco touch class because we're going to
04:24 - be subclassing ui view controller
04:26 - i'm going to call this the pro view
04:28 - controller
04:29 - and let's go ahead and create that
04:32 - class there and then we're going to set
04:35 - this
04:36 - view controller we added set the custom
04:39 - class to
04:40 - that pro view controller and we're gonna
04:45 - draw a segway from the button to here
04:48 - and we're gonna say show
04:51 - so that button is going to lead to our
04:53 - pay wall where they can purchase
04:55 - something if we check that on launch the
04:58 - user is
04:59 - already on the pro access entitlement
05:02 - then instead we're going to show
05:03 - some labels as the tours otherwise we're
05:06 - going to show the button here
05:08 - that would lead them to the paywall that
05:10 - we have here
05:12 - all right so for this view controller
05:13 - let's go ahead and add a stack view
05:16 - a vertical stack view just like before
05:19 - we're going to put some elements in
05:20 - there
05:22 - okay this time i'm going to do 20s all
05:26 - around
05:27 - and then i'm going to put in a label
05:30 - and this is going to be tor
05:33 - app pro
05:43 - i'm going to add another label
05:48 - and for this one i've got the text ready
05:52 - here
05:53 - copy and paste it in there and change
05:55 - the number of lines to zero so it's
05:56 - going to be multi-line
05:58 - and then we're going to add an image
06:03 - so this image is going to be the pro one
06:07 - it's actually really big so it's pushing
06:08 - everything out of the way
06:10 - but we're gonna change the change to the
06:13 - aspect fill like that
06:15 - and we're also going to restrict the
06:18 - height
06:20 - of it to the height of the stack view so
06:23 - i'm holding down control
06:24 - drag it to the stack view and you're
06:26 - going to be able to say equal heights
06:28 - you check out that constraint and saying
06:29 - that image width is equal to the
06:31 - super view width okay so
06:36 - for this stack view i'm going to change
06:38 - the alignment to leading
06:40 - actually and that didn't actually change
06:43 - anything
06:45 - but let's take a look at these errors
06:47 - that we have here
06:49 - all right so set vertical compression
06:51 - resistance
06:52 - so i definitely don't want the labels to
06:54 - be compressed if there's not enough
06:56 - space which is why the image takes up
06:58 - everything
06:59 - so we're going to set the compression
07:01 - resistance for the two labels to be
07:02 - higher than the image and that way
07:04 - they'll never get squished
07:05 - out of view like they are being done now
07:08 - so we're going to set the
07:10 - content compression resistance higher
07:12 - for these labels
07:14 - for both of them higher than the image
07:17 - all right so then
07:18 - we fix that so for this stack view i'm
07:21 - also going to
07:22 - set the spacing to 20 just like the
07:24 - other one and i'm going to put a little
07:26 - icon up there
07:28 - above the heading so we're going to add
07:30 - another image view right there
07:32 - and we're going to select the
07:37 - same one we had before that little it's
07:40 - really small right now so it's really
07:41 - hard to see
07:42 - but why don't we go ahead and give that
07:46 - a little height and width let's say
07:49 - 60 and 100 so you can see it and then
07:52 - we're going to change the tint color to
07:53 - black so that's what our
07:56 - tour app paywall looks like
08:00 - but the buttons to purchase the annual
08:03 - or
08:03 - or the monthly subscription are going to
08:06 - be automatically generated through code
08:08 - because
08:08 - what we're going to do now is have our
08:11 - app connect to
08:12 - the revenue cap platform to pull down
08:14 - that information that we had configured
08:16 - and then we're going to programmatically
08:18 - generate those buttons and insert them
08:20 - into the view hierarchy so that the user
08:22 - can see them
08:24 - so there's a couple of things we need to
08:25 - do we need to add the revenue cat sdk to
08:29 - our project
08:30 - and then we're going to be able to
08:31 - connect to the platform and check if the
08:33 - user has
08:34 - pro access if they have that entitlement
08:37 - if they do we're going to get rid of
08:39 - this button and then we are going to
08:41 - display some
08:42 - uh itinerary information i'm just going
08:45 - to put some labels in there just for
08:46 - show
08:48 - if they don't have that entitlement for
08:50 - pro access
08:51 - then we are going to leave the button as
08:53 - is and when they click that
08:54 - it's going to go over to this screen and
08:56 - that's when we're going to go fetch our
08:57 - products
08:58 - and then generate those buttons to
09:00 - insert here
09:01 - so that they can actually buy the
09:02 - subscription
09:04 - all right great job with this now we're
09:06 - primed to integrate the revenue
09:08 - cat sdk in the next lesson if you
09:10 - haven't signed up for your free account
09:11 - yet you can do so through cwc.to
09:14 - revcat4 now i want to turn it over to
09:17 - you in your app would you rather do
09:19 - one-time in-app purchases or renewable
09:22 - subscriptions
09:23 - let me know by leaving a quick comment
09:25 - below and lastly if you're enjoying this
09:27 - series so far please give this video a
09:28 - thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
09:30 - so you don't miss any future lessons
09:33 - in the next lesson we're going to
09:34 - integrate revenue cat to our xcode
09:36 - project
09:37 - we're going to add the couple of code
09:38 - snippets that's going to let us display
09:40 - our offers
09:41 - take transactions and to check user
09:43 - access levels
09:44 - thanks for watching i'll see you in the
09:45 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

in this video you're going to be building the user interface for our demo app in xcode after that we're going to be able to integrate the revenue cat sdk and display our inapp purchases with just a few snippets of code hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to code with chris the place to be if you want to learn how to code and build apps now this is lesson four of the revenue cat video series if you missed the previous lessons just check that playlist over there here's where we are in our seven step process all right let's get started all right now i'm going to show you how to build out that demo that you saw earlier in the beginning of this tutorial and i won't spend too much time on this because uh really the main point of this video is to show the revenue cat in that purchase stuff so i'm just gonna breeze through this a little bit i just added two graphic assets one for a picture paris and one for compass that we can use on the paywall screen so i'm going to go ahead and go in the main storyboard and i'm going to add a stack view here and i'm not going to explain too much about what i'm doing here in terms of auto layout and how the elements work we have a 29 lesson beginner series that you should definitely check out which would explain a lot of this stuff to you and so here i'm just going to breeze on by so let's go ahead and add a label to our stack view and this is just going to say paris and let's make this bold and we'll also make this spacing 20. here we're going to add the image this is going to be an image of paris and we are going to we're going to add a constraint to this image and say that it's got a maximum height of 400 and then we're going to add another label under that image view oops right here and i've got some text prepared for that we got to make it a multiline so we can actually see it and then we've got a little subheading here city tours so we'll just bold that and i'm actually going to add some margins to this stack view i shouldn't have made it zeros all across and for this image let's make it aspect fill okay and then after that let's add another label down here and i've got some text prepared for that this is going to be multiline and then finally we're going to add a button here and what we're going to do here for this button is say join pro for tours we're going to change the background of this button to let's say say indigo and we'll change the text color to white and we're going to add an image for map in in the lips let's say that and the tint color let's use white as well we'll add a space so it looks something like that that's the button we have all right now for the second screen there's going to be our paywall so i'm going to add a new con view controller here and we're going to create a new class to represent that so go ahead choose new file let's choose coco touch class because we're going to be subclassing ui view controller i'm going to call this the pro view controller and let's go ahead and create that class there and then we're going to set this view controller we added set the custom class to that pro view controller and we're gonna draw a segway from the button to here and we're gonna say show so that button is going to lead to our pay wall where they can purchase something if we check that on launch the user is already on the pro access entitlement then instead we're

now so we're going to set the content compression resistance higher for these labels for both of them higher than the image all right so then we fix that so for this stack view i'm also going to set the spacing to 20 just like the other one and i'm going to put a little icon up there above the heading so we're going to add another image view right there and we're going to select the same one we had before that little it's really small right now so it's really hard to see but why don't we go ahead and give that a little height and width let's say 60 and 100 so you can see it and then we're going to change the tint color to black so that's what our tour app paywall looks like but the buttons to purchase the annual or or the monthly subscription are going to be automatically generated through code because what we're going to do now is have our app connect to the revenue cap platform to pull down that information that we had configured and then we're going to programmatically

click that it's going to go over to this screen and that's when we're going to go fetch our products and then generate those buttons to insert here so that they can actually buy the subscription all right great job with this now we're primed to integrate the revenue cat sdk in the next lesson if you haven't signed up for your free account yet you can do so through cwc.to revcat4 now i want to

the couple of code snippets that's going to let us display our offers take transactions and to check user access levels thanks for watching i'll see you in the next video
