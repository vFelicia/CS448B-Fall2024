00:05 - hello everyone it's Chris here and in
00:08 - this video I'm going to address a common
00:10 - beginner question that I receive and
00:12 - that is the student opens up their
00:15 - project expecting to see user interface
00:18 - elements on their storyboard but they
00:22 - don't see anything it's all empty and
00:24 - it's all blank now if you're starting
00:26 - the project for the very first time then
00:28 - it's going to be blank because we
00:29 - haven't done anything to it
00:31 - yet but if you worked on this project
00:33 - previously and you added elements to the
00:35 - storyboard you would expect to see
00:37 - something there the next time you open
00:38 - up the project so let's take a look at
00:41 - the document outline where it lists all
00:43 - the elements on your storyboard or on
00:45 - your view and see if they're there so if
00:48 - you don't see this sidebar that's going
00:52 - to be right here with a listing of all
00:53 - your elements click this tiny icon on
00:55 - the lower left corner show document
00:58 - outline right and then instantly you'll
01:01 - see this sidebar here so expand this go
01:05 - to the view and you can see that we
01:08 - actually do have a bunch of user
01:11 - interface elements here but they're all
01:12 - grayed out background scroll view this
01:15 - label with the 20 on it and furthermore
01:18 - we have constraints and they're all
01:20 - grayed out too if you don't know what
01:22 - constraints are I suggest that you go
01:25 - through the beginner lessons where
01:27 - you'll get a chance to use them and
01:29 - learn about them okay so now let's
01:31 - address why we can't see any of these
01:33 - elements there's this button down here
01:36 - and this button is to set the size class
01:39 - that you're working in so sometimes when
01:42 - you open up the project it goes back to
01:44 - any width and any height and whereas
01:48 - previously maybe you were working with
01:51 - you know a very specific size class in
01:55 - this project I know it's a landscape
01:57 - project and when we built it we were
01:58 - working in the any width and compact
02:01 - height size class so I'm just going to
02:03 - select that and when I select that size
02:07 - class you'll see that change to any
02:08 - width and compact height and now all of
02:11 - my elements are not grayed out and
02:13 - can see them so what are size classes
02:17 - just a quick note on them it's something
02:20 - that allows you to add constraints and
02:23 - elements to a specific orientation or a
02:26 - specific class of screen sizes which is
02:29 - why they're called size class when it
02:33 - goes to the any width and any height you
02:36 - know if you're adding elements into here
02:38 - into this size class that means that no
02:41 - matter what screen size the user is
02:43 - viewing your app on these elements will
02:45 - be shown in our case we were working
02:49 - with this any width and compact height
02:51 - you can see there's some text below the
02:55 - base values label it says for all
02:57 - compact height layouts iPhones in
03:00 - landscape so because I intended this one
03:04 - to be a landscape iPhone app only
03:08 - displayable in this orientation then we
03:12 - were specifically working in this size
03:14 - class but sometimes when you open up the
03:15 - project again and you know it jumps back
03:17 - to the any with any height size class
03:20 - which explains why all of this stuff is
03:23 - grayed out here so just make a note of
03:25 - that and if you open up your project
03:27 - again and you don't see any of your
03:29 - elements open up your document outline
03:33 - check that there are grayed out elements
03:35 - and then go back and see what size class
03:37 - you're using before and then just change
03:40 - the size class back to that and you
03:42 - should get all your elements back and
03:45 - just a quick note while we're here if
03:47 - you say you added an element to this
03:51 - specific size class but now you want to
03:53 - include it in a different size class you
03:55 - can select your element like I have here
03:58 - selected the background and then if you
04:00 - go over to this inspector pane on the
04:02 - right here if you don't have this click
04:04 - this icon this icon will reveal this go
04:07 - into the it's one of these tabs this one
04:12 - right here and down here you'll see that
04:16 - this background element is installed for
04:19 - the any width and compact height you can
04:22 - see there's a checkmark under installed
04:24 - and if you want to install it into a
04:27 - differ
04:27 - one you can click the plus you know you
04:32 - can select a different different one
04:35 - let's say any width regular height and
04:42 - you can check that off and this
04:45 - background now will be installed for the
04:47 - any width regular height so you check
04:50 - let's change the size class so that any
04:54 - width regular height that's this one
04:59 - right here
05:00 - and you can see our background shows up
05:03 - because here we specify that it's
05:06 - installed for that and likewise you can
05:08 - click this X to exclude it from that
05:13 - size class so size classes are some
05:15 - powerful stuff that warrants further
05:17 - videos and how to utilize them but in
05:20 - this video I just wanted to show you
05:22 - guys what to do if you're expecting to
05:25 - see elements in your storyboard and you
05:27 - don't alright thanks for watching and
05:29 - I'll see you guys next time
