00:00 - hey guys what's up it's Chris here I
00:02 - don't know if you've heard of Brian
00:03 - Boone from let's build that app but he
00:05 - covers a lot of iOS programming in terms
00:08 - of intermediate level and senior level
00:10 - stuff so definitely check him out if you
00:12 - haven't already well recently he did a
00:14 - video covering his salary history in
00:16 - employment history and I thought that
00:18 - would be very interesting for me to do
00:20 - here on this channel as well but from a
00:22 - slightly different perspective because I
00:24 - live in Toronto Canada whereas he lives
00:26 - in the Silicon Valley so when you hear
00:28 - the numbers that I'm about to share with
00:30 - you do keep in mind that I live in
00:32 - Canada specifically Toronto in the
00:35 - process of reaching a six-figure salary
00:36 - I also left my job three times so it's
00:40 - interesting how that happened and let me
00:42 - tell you all about it so let me set the
00:44 - stage the year with 2007 I just
00:46 - graduated from university fresh out of
00:49 - school I got hired at a consulting
00:52 - company and let's call it company a
00:54 - because I know there may be some people
00:56 - watching this videos that I've worked
00:58 - with or some previous employers that may
01:01 - not like me actually sharing these
01:02 - details so I'm going to call it company
01:03 - a it was a consulting company about 175
01:07 - people so it's a fair sized company and
01:10 - for those of you guys who don't know
01:11 - what a consulting company does they
01:14 - basically write software for other
01:16 - people for clients and a lot of the
01:19 - clients you would recognize as Airlines
01:21 - they could be banks they could be in
01:23 - fact this consulting company worked a
01:24 - lot with banks so we built a lot of
01:26 - banking software so during this time it
01:29 - was great because as part of consulting
01:31 - you get to work on a lot of different
01:33 - projects for short amount of time so
01:35 - every 3-4 months we'd finish a project
01:37 - with client and we'd move on to another
01:39 - client and with each client you go
01:41 - through this process of gathering
01:42 - requirements designing wireframes and
01:45 - you know all the way from prototyping
01:47 - building the software testing it and
01:49 - deploying it and you get to do all that
01:51 - in a span of you know four six months
01:53 - but different time ranges depending on
01:56 - how big the project is also you get to
01:58 - travel a lot so I got to travel to all
02:01 - around the States working with different
02:02 - companies that was a lot of fun
02:03 - especially for someone fresh out of
02:05 - school and travel a lot and most of the
02:08 - times I would travel with one other
02:09 - person or a small team if it was a
02:11 - bigger project
02:13 - and there was one time where actually
02:14 - got to go to Las Vegas and that was by
02:17 - myself so that was a very memorable
02:18 - experience where I had to deploy a piece
02:22 - of software for competing that was going
02:24 - to demo something on stage so it was
02:26 - kind of scary
02:27 - at the same time but kind of exciting
02:29 - and it worked out well I'll tell you
02:30 - guys about that another time so the
02:33 - other thing with consulting is that I
02:34 - got to develop some soft skills not just
02:37 - technical skills being at the keyboard
02:40 - typing and coding I got to work on
02:42 - skills where I would have to speak with
02:45 - clients manage expectations and a lot of
02:48 - the times you're thrown into the fire
02:50 - but if client asks you a question and
02:52 - catches you off-guard you have to think
02:54 - on your feet and you have to sound
02:55 - eloquent because otherwise they would
02:57 - kind of lose confidence in you and I
02:59 - guess I forgot to mention that these
03:01 - clients are paying these consulting
03:03 - companies upwards of one hundred and
03:06 - seventy-five dollars or more even but
03:08 - for for my rate I believe it was about
03:11 - one hundred and seventy-five dollars an
03:12 - hour of course I'm not getting paid that
03:14 - much but obviously the consulting
03:17 - company takes a big cut out of that so I
03:20 - really enjoyed my time at the consulting
03:22 - company and when I started working there
03:25 - as a fresh grad I remembered getting
03:28 - through the final interview sitting in
03:30 - the president's office and talking to
03:32 - him and he asked me what are your salary
03:34 - expectations so at the time as a fresh
03:36 - grad 50k was already a great starting
03:40 - salary so I told him 53 to 58 that was
03:44 - the range that I was expecting and I
03:45 - remember that he said to me that's a
03:47 - really odd number why 53 to 58 and I
03:51 - said because that would be more than
03:52 - what my girlfriend was making at the
03:53 - time so that's not career advice for you
03:57 - that's just what I said
03:58 - and when I think back on it it's kind of
04:00 - funny to negotiate it like that and I
04:04 - told my girlfriend about it afterwards
04:05 - and she got a chuckle out of it but when
04:07 - I got hired I started off at 58 so maybe
04:10 - I asked her too little but anyways I
04:12 - learned a ton and I had a great
04:14 - experience there I stayed up this
04:16 - company for two years and in the process
04:19 - I started from you know just a developer
04:22 - to a team lead they promoted really fast
04:24 - I got to lead a team I got to trial
04:26 - on my own I got to I got to speak with
04:29 - clients on my own and I worked with a
04:32 - lot of different technologies as well so
04:34 - this consulting company was primarily a
04:36 - Microsoft shop so initially I worked
04:38 - with c-sharp and asp.net doing web
04:41 - applications and then we did some
04:43 - desktop applications with WPF which is
04:46 - windows presentations frameworks and it
04:49 - basically allows you to build very fluid
04:51 - very animated desktop applications for
04:54 - PCs and then after that I got to work on
04:58 - my first touch device and it's probably
05:02 - something you guys don't remember or
05:03 - haven't seen actually I would be
05:05 - surprised if you guys have because not
05:08 - many of them made it to consumers hands
05:09 - but it was basically called the
05:12 - Microsoft Surface now let me stop you
05:14 - there it's not the tablet that you know
05:16 - today it is it was this giant coffee
05:19 - table it was a 40 inch touchscreen but
05:22 - it was it was a screen that was embedded
05:24 - in a coffee table if you can imagine
05:26 - that it was a touchscreen so you built
05:28 - apps for it using WPF and I'm going to
05:32 - show a little video of it over my head
05:35 - right now so you can kind of see it in
05:37 - action while I speak but it was really
05:39 - cool because it enabled these
05:40 - experiences that you couldn't imagine
05:44 - before so imagine something like going
05:47 - to a bar and then being able to order
05:49 - off of the table I mean now it might be
05:51 - kind of easy because you can embed there
05:54 - I mean there's touchscreens everywhere
05:56 - but at that time the iPad wasn't out the
05:59 - iPhone wasn't out and you had this giant
06:01 - touchscreen coffee table and the cool
06:04 - thing about it was is that they had
06:06 - these little tags that you can put
06:08 - underneath objects like cups and stuff
06:10 - like that or different products so you
06:12 - can put those products on the table and
06:14 - then it would almost be like the table
06:17 - could sense the object and then tell you
06:19 - about it because the screen would kind
06:21 - of light up around the object and tell
06:24 - you more about it because of that code
06:25 - so there are a lot of cool things that
06:28 - in enabled and there were some shopping
06:31 - experiences that I think we installed at
06:34 - Banana Republic where you can kind of
06:35 - have a model and you can see different
06:37 - pieces of clothing on it in a table
06:39 - environment
06:40 - and a lot of the times we deployed these
06:42 - in lobbies like hotel lobbies and stuff
06:45 - like that anyways that was a really cool
06:47 - experience but needless to say I don't
06:49 - think it really took off because mark
06:51 - Strauss discontinued that product they
06:53 - when they launched the tablets and they
06:55 - called it Microsoft Surface they renamed
06:57 - the table to pixel sense and then now
06:59 - it's completely gone but nonetheless it
07:02 - was really cool next I worked on
07:05 - something called March 12 Silverlight
07:07 - and think of it as the Microsoft version
07:09 - of flash so it enabled rich web
07:13 - experiences and this was huge back then
07:16 - because we didn't have html5 we didn't
07:18 - have you know all of those cool
07:20 - animations going on that enabled with
07:22 - css3 and html5 and stuff like that so
07:25 - flash was really big right and Microsoft
07:29 - Silverlight was kind of a contender to
07:31 - that as well and everything I learned
07:33 - with WPF were in working with surface
07:37 - was actually transferable to Silverlight
07:41 - because so far everything that I've been
07:43 - talking about has been using the
07:44 - programming language C sharp but in
07:46 - addition to C sharp designing the user
07:48 - interface it would be using something
07:51 - called demo which was just XML and the
07:55 - Microsoft Surface uses the WPF for
07:58 - desktop applications use this and so did
08:00 - Silverlight so Silverlight was brand new
08:02 - everyone wanted to learn about it at
08:04 - this time I met someone from Microsoft
08:06 - who was an evangelist for Silverlight
08:08 - and she hooked me up with these two guys
08:10 - in Toronto who has this small consulting
08:13 - company it was just them two and one
08:16 - other students let's call this company B
08:20 - because they're going to play a part in
08:22 - my career soon but anyways I got hooked
08:25 - up with them and we started a Toronto
08:28 - meetup or user group for Silverlight so
08:31 - we would host these meetups after work
08:34 - at different locations downtown and I
08:36 - would speak and I would present and we'd
08:38 - have other presenters and we'd have
08:39 - pizza and prizes and it was a great time
08:41 - by anyways I got to know these two guys
08:43 - and they were working with Microsoft as
08:46 - well and they were doing like really
08:47 - small projects because they were so
08:49 - small one of them was the tech guy one
08:51 - of them was
08:52 - guy and they had to suit it so at this
08:55 - time I've been working at this company a
08:57 - this mid-sized consulting company for
08:59 - two years I started off at 58 K like I
09:03 - said and by the time I left after two
09:06 - years I was making 68k and I was a team
09:09 - leader by the time I left and the reason
09:12 - I left was because I wanted to start my
09:13 - own business and it is as simple as that
09:16 - I've always been very entrepreneurial
09:18 - and during university I have all of
09:20 - these side businesses and side hustles
09:22 - not all of them tech related maybe I'll
09:24 - tell you guys about that in the future
09:26 - if you're interested let me know in the
09:29 - comments below as you are but anyways I
09:31 - left what most people would call a good
09:34 - thing because I was getting promoted and
09:37 - I was well respected and everything but
09:38 - I decided to leave that to start my own
09:40 - business

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up it's Chris here I don't know if you've heard of Brian Boone from let's build that app but he covers a lot of iOS programming in terms of intermediate level and senior level stuff so definitely check him out if you haven't already well recently he did a video covering his salary history in employment history and I thought that would be very interesting for me to do here on this
