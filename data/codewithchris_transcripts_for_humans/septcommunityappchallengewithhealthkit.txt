00:00 - hey code crew this month we're running
00:01 - our fourth community app challenge this
00:04 - time we're challenging you to tap into
00:06 - health kit to do something cool
00:08 - in previous app challenges we spelled
00:10 - out the exact app requirements for you
00:12 - to build but this time we're trying
00:14 - something different we're going to let
00:15 - you decide what you want to build with
00:17 - health kit
00:18 - i'm hoping that having a loose theme
00:20 - like health kit is going to increase the
00:22 - variety of apps that we see at the end
00:23 - of the month and i'll also give you an
00:25 - opportunity to get creative with what
00:27 - you want to build as long as it's using
00:29 - health kit in some way it's meeting the
00:31 - requirements for this month's app
00:33 - challenge now here's what jesse from our
00:35 - team decided to build
00:38 - hey code crew this is a preview of our
00:40 - sample solution for the hydration app
00:41 - challenge
00:42 - this app works with health kit so it'll
00:44 - ask for permission the first time it is
00:46 - opened
00:49 - the app allows users to log the fluid
00:50 - intake
00:51 - by specifying the type of drink
00:56 - as well as the amount
01:05 - intake will appear in a list with the
01:06 - time it was locked
01:08 - and
01:08 - circular progress bar shows the user's
01:10 - progress for the day
01:12 - they can delete items whenever they wish
01:17 - the info sheet gives some useful
01:19 - information behind why it's good to stay
01:20 - hydrated and highlights the recommended
01:22 - daily goals
01:24 - it's optional
01:28 - the settings sheet allows users to
01:30 - change their goal
01:37 - and a manual button to log to healthcare
01:42 - in our version of the app when logging
01:44 - is done
01:45 - the listings disappear and the data is
01:46 - saved to the health app
01:48 - but you can implement health integration
01:49 - any way you like as long as the data
01:52 - goes to the health app
01:54 - additionally
01:55 - our app automatically logs at the end of
01:58 - each day
01:59 - so let's go to our health app
02:07 - sure enough you can see that our intake
02:09 - has been added
02:10 - you can choose to follow suit and build
02:12 - this hydration app or you can do
02:14 - something completely different as long
02:16 - as it taps into health kit now in terms
02:18 - of rewards just like in all of our
02:20 - previous app challenges just by
02:22 - attempting it you're going to earn a
02:23 - spiffy new code crew form badge and if
02:27 - you finish your app by the end of the
02:28 - month we'll showcase your app in a video
02:31 - that will be shown on our youtube
02:32 - channel and our social media accounts
02:34 - and we'll also feature your social media

02:38 - alright that all sounds good but how do
02:40 - you get involved well in the description

02:51 - journey and you're just getting into ios
02:53 - development this challenge may be a
