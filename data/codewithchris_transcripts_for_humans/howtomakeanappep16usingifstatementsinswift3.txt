00:06 - hey everyone welcome to Lesson 16 of how
00:08 - to make iPhone apps with no programming
00:10 - experience in this lesson you're going
00:12 - to learn about the if statement which
00:14 - allows us to express some logic in our
00:17 - code so let's get started with that in a
00:20 - playground so I can show you how it
00:22 - works before we implement it into our
00:25 - actual xcode project call this the if
00:28 - playground
00:30 - just going to save it on my desktop here
00:33 - all right let's start by declaring two
00:37 - uh two variables here V AAL 10 and VAR b
00:41 - equal 5 an if statement will allow us to
00:46 - compare the two numbers and to do
00:48 - something so we start off by using IF
00:52 - for if and then we can put some sort of
00:55 - condition okay so let me put the
00:58 - condition is a is L than
01:01 - b and now we open up a curly bracket
01:06 - like that and pressing enter and xcode
01:08 - after you open a curly bracket will
01:10 - usually uh xcode will automatically fill
01:13 - this ending bracket in for you so this
01:17 - code reads if a is less than b then do
01:21 - whatever code in
01:23 - here if this is not true let's say that
01:27 - a well it is not true right now now a is
01:31 - 10 and B is 5 so a definitely is not
01:34 - less than b then it's just going to skip
01:37 - over whatever you put into these curly
01:41 - brackets so that lets you execute some
01:44 - block of code on a certain condition now
01:48 - we can specify the other Branch so if
01:53 - this is true then do this block of code
01:58 - else do another block of code so your
02:02 - code can now take two directions based
02:04 - on this condition so if it's true it's
02:06 - going to do this block of code or if
02:09 - it's false it's going to do this block
02:11 - of code so it's either going to do this
02:14 - block of code or that block of code it's
02:15 - not going to do both okay so it's going
02:18 - to take either one branch this Branch
02:21 - right here or this Branch right
02:23 - there another cool thing about the if
02:25 - statement is that you can test for
02:28 - multiple conditions so so here I'm
02:30 - testing for a is less than b then this
02:34 - will
02:36 - happen if a is greater than b then this
02:39 - will happen but what if a equals B well
02:43 - I can test for that by in between the if
02:46 - and the else I can start another Branch
02:49 - so I would say else if a equals
02:56 - b equals equals actually then I can open
03:00 - up another branch of
03:03 - code so let me first explain this equals
03:06 - equals sign this is comparing if a is
03:10 - the same as b or a is equal to B do not
03:13 - use a single equal sign because we use
03:16 - single equal signs to assign values into
03:20 - things so as you can see up here with
03:22 - these two variables uh in order to
03:25 - compare we use the double equal sign
03:27 - like that so what happen happens here
03:30 - first xcode checks this condition and if
03:33 - it's true then it executes this block of
03:35 - code and it skips everything
03:37 - else um if this is false then it's going
03:40 - to check the next line or the next
03:43 - condition and it's going to check this
03:45 - and if this is true it's going to
03:47 - execute this block of code and Skip
03:48 - everything below it and then finally
03:51 - else is kind of like the catch all or
03:53 - the fall back and if none of the
03:56 - conditions above it are true then it's
03:57 - going to execute this block of code code
04:00 - okay so this is kind of this uh sort of
04:03 - structure that we're going to follow in
04:05 - our war card game project we're going to
04:07 - compare the two card numbers uh and then
04:10 - there's a situation where they might be
04:12 - equal and then this last case is for if
04:16 - um the other number is greater and this
04:19 - is the other number is less
04:22 - than before we move on let me show you a
04:24 - couple of other operators and a couple
04:26 - of other cool things with if statements
04:29 - for example we can do less than or equal
04:32 - to or you can do greater than or equal
04:35 - to you can also chain these statements
04:38 - together so you might want to test for
04:40 - something like this if a is greater than
04:44 - b let's say we had
04:48 - another variable here and let's just
04:50 - call it one so if a is greater than
04:53 - b and you wanted another condition you
04:56 - can can do something like this so this
05:00 - end statement means that this condition
05:04 - has to be true and this condition has to
05:07 - be true in order to satisfy the whole
05:13 - condition okay so if both of these
05:16 - conditions are true only then will it
05:19 - come into this branch of code if either
05:21 - one of these are false then it's going
05:24 - to not satisfy this condition and it's
05:27 - going to go go down and and check the
05:29 - next if
05:30 - statement aside from and you can do
05:33 - double Ampersand sign you can do
05:38 - or so doing this we'll check if either
05:43 - this is true or this is true that will
05:46 - be enough to
05:48 - satisfy uh this condition and it'll come
05:50 - into here this block of code and it'll
05:52 - skip everything else so the or statement
05:56 - gives a little more flexibility you're
05:58 - testing either if this is true or if
06:00 - this is true and if any of them is true
06:04 - then that's fine right but the end is
06:08 - more strict and you
06:09 - need both of those conditions to be true
06:13 - in order to satisfy this branch of
06:17 - code okay so keep that in mind because
06:20 - we'll probably be using that in a future
06:23 - app now let's jump into our xcode
06:27 - project our war card game and let's
06:30 - Implement
06:31 - that okay so here we are we are looking
06:34 - at viewcontroller.swift I'm going to
06:36 - come down here when the deal button is
06:38 - tapped we are going to do a couple of
06:42 - things here um compare the card numbers
06:47 - so start an if statement
06:51 - if uh left number is greater
06:55 - than right
06:58 - number right right left card
07:02 - wins we have else if left number double
07:06 - equal sign right
07:09 - number then it's a tie and then finally
07:13 - else and in this case the right card
07:18 - wins all right so now we've set up our
07:21 - if statement so that we can consider
07:24 - each of these cases and do something in
07:26 - response to these different situations
07:29 - in the next lesson we're going to finish
07:31 - this off by updating the labels in our
07:34 - storyboard thanks for watching guys and
07:36 - I'll see you guys in the next lesson bye
07:38 - for now
