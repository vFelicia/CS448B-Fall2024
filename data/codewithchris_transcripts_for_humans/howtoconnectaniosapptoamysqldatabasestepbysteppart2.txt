00:06 - hello YouTubers it's Chris here and in
00:08 - this video we're going to continue
00:10 - talking about how to connect an IOS app
00:12 - to a mySQL database now if you're a
00:15 - regular you might notice that I sound a
00:17 - little different in this video and
00:18 - that's just because I'm getting over a
00:19 - minor cold I hope that doesn't distract
00:22 - you too much I didn't want to wait too
00:25 - long before releasing the next part in
00:27 - this
00:28 - series okay so let's jump right into it
00:31 - take a look at this diagram here if
00:33 - you've done any sort of web development
00:35 - you might be used to having your web app
00:38 - connect directly to the
00:40 - database however in Mobile development
00:42 - we're going to need to build a set of
00:44 - web services uh that sit in between the
00:47 - client mobile app and the database and
00:51 - if you're not familiar with what a web
00:52 - service is you can think of it as a
00:54 - chunk of code that sits on a server uh
00:57 - that you can hit a URL and have execute
01:00 - that code so essentially what we're
01:02 - going to do is have our IOS app hit
01:06 - these web services and in the case of
01:08 - say saving data it would pass that data
01:11 - to the web service and then the web
01:12 - service would uh take that data and
01:15 - insert it into our database and for
01:17 - retrieving data U the IOS app would
01:21 - again hit the web service make a request
01:24 - the web service would then run the
01:26 - retrieval code to grab the data from the
01:28 - database and return it uh back to the
01:31 - IOS app for the database part of this
01:34 - diagram we've chosen to use MySQL so as
01:37 - you can see in this three-part diagram
01:39 - you can choose any sort of text stack
01:41 - that you want for the client app you
01:43 - know we're working with iOS but you
01:46 - could have an Android app also hit these
01:48 - web services that you're going to build
01:50 - and for the database you can choose any
01:52 - sort of database you want in this case
01:55 - we are choosing
01:56 - MySQL and for the web service there's
01:59 - tons of different Technologies you can
02:01 - use we're going to use PHP uh you could
02:03 - use you know node.js
02:05 - or um Ruby or something like that there
02:08 - are tons of options to choose from I've
02:12 - chosen to use PHP for my web service
02:15 - here and that's simply because I have at
02:18 - least a little bit of experience with it
02:19 - and when I say a little bit of
02:21 - experience I actually mean beginner so
02:24 - I've done uh not that much web
02:26 - development so if you're watching this
02:28 - video and you are a web developer
02:30 - chances are you will probably have best
02:32 - practices to point out to me in the
02:34 - comments uh or if you've worked with
02:37 - other uh web Technologies you'll
02:39 - probably be able to uh build a better
02:42 - web service than I'll be showing you in
02:44 - this video however my purpose is to show
02:47 - you how to connect an IOS app to a mySQL
02:50 - database and even with my limited web
02:53 - development experience I will be able to
02:56 - create a simple demo to show you how to
02:58 - do just that
03:00 - okay so this video was just to set the
03:02 - stage for what we're about to do here
03:05 - we're going to uh we're going to have to
03:07 - build the client app right we're going
03:09 - to have to uh find some hosting and also
03:13 - create our PHP web service and then
03:15 - we're going to have to set up our
03:16 - database put in some data there and
03:19 - we're going to have to set up our
03:20 - database user so that the web service
03:22 - can use that database user to access the
03:24 - data I also wanted to point out that I
03:27 - have updated this article now so if you
03:29 - want to kind of get a little preview or
03:33 - kind of read the article before I
03:34 - release the rest of the video series
03:36 - just go ahead and hit up this URL I'll
03:39 - put it in the description below the
03:41 - video all right so thanks for watching
03:43 - this part and I'll see you in the next
03:44 - part of the series bye for now

hello YouTubers it's Chris here and in this video we're going to continue talking about how to connect an IOS app to a mySQL database now if you're a regular you might notice that I sound a little different in this video and that's just because I'm getting over a minor cold I hope that doesn't distract you too much I didn't want to wait too long before releasing the next part in this series okay so let's jump right into it take a look at this diagram here if you've done any sort of web development you might be used to having your web app connect directly to the database however in Mobile development we're going to need to build a set of web services uh that sit in between the client mobile app and the database and if you're not familiar with what a web service is you can think of it as a chunk of code that sits on a server uh that you can hit a URL and have execute that code so essentially what we're going to do is have our IOS app hit these web services and in the case of say saving data it would pass that data to the web service and then the web service would uh take that data and insert it into our database and for retrieving data U the IOS app would again hit the web service make a request the web service would then run the retrieval code to grab the data from the database and return it uh back to the IOS app for the database part of this diagram we've chosen to use MySQL so as you can see in this threepart diagram you can choose any sort of text stack that you want for the client app you know we're working with iOS but you could have an Android app also hit these web services that you're going to build and for the database you can choose any sort of database you want in this case we are choosing MySQL and for the web service there's tons of different Technologies you can use we're going to use PHP uh you could use you know node.js or um Ruby or something like that there are tons of options to choose from I've chosen to use PHP for my web service here and that's simply because I have at least a little bit of experience with it and when I say a little bit of experience I actually mean beginner so I've done uh not that much web development so if you're watching this video and you are a web developer chances are you will probably have best practices to point out to me in the comments uh or if you've worked with other uh web Technologies you'll probably be able to uh build a better web service than I'll be showing you in this video however my purpose is to show you how to connect an IOS app to a mySQL database and even with my limited web development experience I will be able to create a simple demo to show you how to do just that okay so this video was just to set the stage for what we're about to do here we're going to uh we're going to have to build the client app right we're going to have to uh find some hosting and also create our PHP web service and then we're going to have to set up our database put in some data there and we're going to have to set up our database user so that the web service can use that database user to access the data I also wanted to point out that I have updated this article now so if you want to kind of get a little preview or kind of read the article before I release the rest of the video series just go ahead and hit up this URL I'll put it in the description below the video all right so thanks for watching this part and I'll see you in the next part of the series bye for now
