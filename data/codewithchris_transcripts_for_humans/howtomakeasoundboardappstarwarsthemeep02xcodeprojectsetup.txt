00:02 - hey coders how's it going hope you guys
00:04 - are having a great morning so far and
00:06 - today we're going to start on our
00:08 - soundboard app so what I'm going to do
00:11 - first is create a brand new xcode
00:13 - project we're also going to want to
00:16 - download the sounds but we're going to
00:18 - get to that in a little bit so let's
00:20 - create a single View application and I'm
00:23 - going to call this the soundboard
00:25 - demo and make sure that the language is
00:27 - Swift that's the most important thing uh
00:30 - devices iPhone for me and these options
00:33 - are all unchecked I'm also not creating
00:36 - a git repository I'm just going to save
00:38 - this on my
00:40 - desktop now the next thing we're going
00:42 - to want to do is visit that link that I
00:44 - specified in the last lesson and I'll
00:47 - link to it in the description below as
00:48 - well but it brings you to this page and
00:51 - you're going to want to download a bunch
00:52 - of sounds now uh whether it's mb3 or
00:55 - wave I think both are fine with the AV
00:57 - Audio player but with the implementation
01:00 - that we're going to do you're going to
01:01 - want to stay consistent so what I mean
01:03 - is if you're going to download waves
01:05 - then download all of them as waves if
01:07 - you're going to do MP3s then do all of
01:09 - them as MP3s so I chose four sounds
01:13 - right here as you can see on my desktop
01:15 - and that's the lightsaber the Blaster
01:17 - firing Chewbacca Roar and Darth Vader
01:20 - breathing and they're all wave files
01:23 - okay so make sure that if you're
01:25 - downloading the sounds just make sure
01:27 - they're all MP3s or they're all wave
01:29 - files and and that's simply due to how
01:31 - we're going to implement it it's not a
01:33 - technical limitation now point out why
01:35 - we have to download all of one kind um
01:37 - as we're writing the code okay so make
01:39 - sure you have all of your sounds
01:42 - downloaded and now we're going to import
01:44 - it into our project what I'm going to do
01:47 - here is right click or hold down control
01:49 - and left click if you have a one button
01:51 - Mouse I'm going to create a new group
01:54 - and I'm going to call this sounds now a
01:56 - group isn't an actual folder in your
01:59 - project directory so if I go to my
02:01 - project directory
02:02 - now uh desktop soundboard demo you're
02:06 - going to see that there's no actual
02:08 - sound folder created it's just a a
02:11 - logical group it's to organize the files
02:13 - in your excode project and it doesn't
02:15 - translate to how it actually looks in
02:17 - here if you do want it to translate to
02:20 - an actual folder here what you can do is
02:22 - you can create the actual folder in the
02:24 - soundboard demo and then you can drag
02:27 - the
02:28 - folder in to the xcode project so let me
02:31 - show
02:32 - you uh so first of all I'm going to put
02:35 - these four sound files into this new
02:37 - sound folder which I created inside my
02:40 - project and then I would physically drag
02:43 - this folder into the xcode project and
02:46 - then here it would create folder
02:48 - references okay like that and it's going
02:50 - to be a blue folder so I accidentally
02:53 - put it into this group but you kind of
02:55 - get the idea so this blue folder means
02:57 - that it directly correlates to a folder
03:00 - in your project while these yellow
03:03 - folders are just groups so I'm actually
03:05 - going to delete this uh I'm just going
03:07 - to remove the reference so I don't want
03:09 - to remove all the sounds so what I
03:11 - usually do because I like keeping them
03:13 - as groups uh I would create the folder
03:15 - in my project folder and add the Sounds
03:18 - here but then I wouldn't Drag The Sounds
03:21 - folder into the project I would simply
03:23 - drag the files okay so I would create a
03:27 - new group called sounds then I would
03:30 - create the folder in my project
03:32 - directory I would add the sounds to that
03:34 - but then I would actually just drag
03:36 - these files into this group right here
03:39 - and I'm going to choose create groups uh
03:42 - that's fine I don't need to copy the
03:44 - items into my project because they're
03:45 - already in my project and I'm just going
03:48 - to create groups like that and I click
03:50 - finish and then I have all these files
03:52 - underneath the sound folder and then
03:54 - finally let me show you another way of
03:56 - doing it so let me just move these files
03:59 - back back to the desktop let me delete
04:01 - this sound folder which I created let me
04:05 - delete this okay so we're kind of
04:08 - starting back at the state we were back
04:10 - in so this is the easiest way to do it
04:13 - just create a new group called sounds
04:16 - and then drag these wave files or MP3
04:19 - files straight from the desktop or
04:21 - wherever you Sav them and drag them into
04:23 - your new
04:24 - group and then down here uh make sure it
04:27 - says create groups and check this copy
04:31 - items if needed because it's going to
04:33 - copy the wave files from the your
04:35 - desktop or wherever you saved it into
04:38 - your project folder because you want to
04:39 - keep everything together so check this
04:41 - off uh make sure this is checked you
04:44 - want to make sure that the sounds will
04:45 - be added to your
04:47 - Target and click finish and then now you
04:50 - have these sounds and what it did is it
04:53 - just made a copy of those wave files in
04:55 - your root project directory uh and these
04:58 - files right here in your project are
05:00 - referencing these guys so you can feel
05:02 - safe to delete them off your desktop
05:05 - wherever you save them so now okay
05:08 - that's probably the easiest way to do it
05:09 - but if you're going to have a ton of
05:11 - files you're going to have like images
05:12 - sounds and all that then I would
05:14 - recommend you creating some sort of
05:16 - organization within your project folder
05:19 - uh okay but otherwise both ways work
05:21 - fine so now we have the Sounds in our
05:23 - excode project we're just going to
05:25 - really quickly set up um our storyboard
05:29 - here
05:30 - so as you saw in the previous video they
05:32 - were all just kind of a bunch of buttons
05:35 - so I'm just going to drag four buttons
05:37 - here like that doesn't matter where you
05:39 - put them I'm just kind of aligning them
05:41 - because what we're going to do is we're
05:43 - going to hold down command and click all
05:45 - of them so you make sure they're all
05:47 - highlighted and then you're going to
05:48 - click this one called put in a stack
05:50 - view or just stack it's going to put
05:53 - them all into a stack view
05:54 - element uh and then let's open up the
05:57 - document Outline by clicking this little
05:58 - icon down here
06:00 - click your stack View and then go down
06:02 - here let's add some constraints and I'm
06:05 - simply going to horizontally and
06:07 - vertically Center it add these two
06:09 - constraints we're going to update the
06:11 - frames furthermore uh click the stack
06:15 - View and then on the right hand side in
06:17 - the property inspector for the spacing
06:20 - I'm going to put 50 and that's just
06:22 - going to space them out a little bit
06:24 - like that and then I'm going to
06:26 - vertically update all the frames again
06:31 - like that so it places it there and then
06:33 - now I'm going to change the button text
06:35 - so this one was uh's
06:42 - lightsaber Blaster
06:48 - firing chewy
06:54 - Roar and Darth Vader okay and now I'm
06:57 - just going to
07:00 - update all the frames again and now
07:03 - let's give it a
07:10 - run all right so now we have all of our
07:12 - buttons they don't do anything right now
07:14 - but I just wanted to verify that they
07:15 - were positioned correctly so your demo
07:18 - right now should look kind of like this
07:20 - as
07:20 - well so that was quick and easy right
07:23 - and you know what the cool thing is
07:24 - we're actually halfway there in the next
07:27 - video I'm going to show you how easy it
07:29 - is to to play a sound in your project
07:31 - using AV Audio player uh and we're also
07:34 - going to hook up these buttons to play
07:36 - those sounds so I look forward to seeing
07:39 - you guys tomorrow thanks for watching
07:40 - and please don't forget to subscribe
07:43 - like and share this with your friends
07:44 - and family I would really appreciate it
07:46 - so thank you so much I'll see you
07:48 - tomorrow bye

just move these files back back to the desktop let me delete this sound folder which I created let me delete this okay so we're kind of starting back at the state we were back in so this is the easiest way to do it just create a new group called sounds and then drag these wave files or MP3 files straight from the desktop or wherever you Sav them and drag them into your new group and then down here uh make sure it says create groups and check this copy items if needed because it's going to copy the wave files from the your desktop or wherever you saved it into your project folder because you want to keep everything together so check this off uh make sure this is checked you want to make sure that the sounds will be added to your Target and click finish and then now you have these sounds and what it did is it just made a copy of those wave files in your root project directory uh and these files right here in your project are referencing these guys so you can feel safe to delete them off your desktop wherever you save them so now okay that's probably the easiest way to do it but if you're going to have a ton of files you're going to have like images sounds and all that then I would recommend you creating some sort of organization within your project folder uh okay but otherwise both ways work fine so now we have the Sounds in our excode project we're just going to
