00:01 - hey coders what's up it's Chris here and
00:04 - today we're going to look at firebase
00:06 - firebase is a back-end as a service and
00:09 - that allows you very very easily to give
00:11 - your app database capabilities so if you
00:14 - ever wanted to do something with your
00:15 - app like user accounts or you wanted to
00:17 - store data on the cloud in a database
00:20 - firebase will allow you to do that very
00:22 - easily without having to set up your own
00:24 - servers and manage your own servers in
00:26 - this particular lesson we're going to
00:28 - sign up for a firebase account and then
00:30 - we're going to integrate the firebase
00:32 - libraries into our Xcode project using
00:35 - cocoapods
00:36 - so Google actually owns firebase which
00:37 - is why the sign up button you need a
00:40 - Google account if you don't have one
00:42 - it's gonna go and prompt you to either
00:44 - log in with a Google account or sign up
00:46 - for one so I've already done that I'm
00:48 - gonna click sign up with Google anyways
00:49 - and it's gonna detect that I'm already
00:52 - logged in so after you sign up for an
00:54 - account and you get logged in you're
00:56 - looking at your firebase dashboard by
00:58 - default they're gonna create an app for
01:00 - you right here notice that there is this
01:03 - URL here and this firebase URL is gonna
01:06 - be very important because that's gonna
01:08 - identify this particular database that
01:11 - we want to write and read data from
01:12 - we're not going to jump into the
01:14 - dashboard for this app yet what I want
01:16 - to do is go into quick starts and I'm
01:18 - gonna choose iOS here and then this is
01:21 - going to show us how to install their
01:22 - SDK with cocoapods so there's also a
01:25 - video up here if you want to watch the
01:27 - video instead what we're going to do is
01:30 - open up Xcode and create a single view
01:33 - application first
01:34 - okay so let's create a new Xcode project
01:37 - and I'm just gonna choose single View
01:41 - application here I'm gonna call it the
01:43 - firebase demo and make sure that the
01:47 - language is Swift and devices iPhone and
01:50 - we're not using any of those features
01:52 - I'm just gonna save it in my desktop and
01:57 - now that we've created our Xcode project
01:59 - we're going to have to close it because
02:02 - we're going to install the cocoa pod so
02:04 - first of all in my project directory I
02:07 - don't have a pod file so I'm going to
02:10 - have to create a pod file so that I can
02:12 - specify
02:13 - that I want to install the firebase
02:15 - cocoapod now if you don't know what
02:17 - cocoapods is then check out the video in
02:19 - the upper right hand corner right here
02:21 - and it's gonna open up a new window and
02:22 - show you how to setup cocoa pods on your
02:24 - machine so that you can easily install
02:26 - firebase so with that said I'm going to
02:28 - jump into terminal pressing command
02:30 - spacebar and typing in terminal and I'm
02:33 - gonna navigate to my project directory
02:36 - so let's see where we're at right here
02:39 - we're at my home folder type CD desktop
02:43 - to go into the desktop folder and then
02:45 - CD firebase I'm gonna press tab and it's
02:49 - gonna autocomplete that folder name for
02:51 - me and so there I am I'm gonna type in
02:54 - pod space in it and that's going to
02:56 - create the pod file as you can see here
02:58 - and then I'm just going to right click
03:00 - I'm going to open that with my text
03:02 - editor sublime text and then what we can
03:09 - do is follow this and there's a handy
03:15 - copy button right there okay we're gonna
03:17 - copy that and paste that between the
03:19 - target and the end and that just
03:21 - specifies that we're gonna want the
03:23 - firebase pod I'm gonna press command s
03:25 - to save it and now we're going to go
03:28 - back to terminal and we're going to type
03:31 - pod space install so that's gonna go
03:34 - ahead and grab the firebase libraries
03:36 - and pull them down let's go back to the
03:38 - documentation for a little bit okay so
03:41 - we didn't we didn't follow these
03:42 - instructions here actually this one was
03:45 - opening the pod file in Xcode so instead
03:47 - of opening the pod file in your text
03:48 - editor you can open it up in Xcode by
03:51 - typing this command in terminal
03:53 - so that's alternatively you can do that
03:56 - so we ran the pod install command and
03:58 - here through terminal you can type open
04:01 - and then firebase demo XE workspace to
04:05 - open that but we're just going to see if
04:08 - that's complete okay it's still going it
04:10 - might take a while okay there it goes
04:13 - okay let's check back on that in a
04:15 - little while so all we have to do in
04:18 - Swift is we're gonna have to import
04:20 - firebase before we use the firebase
04:23 - classes and reading and writing data is
04:26 - pretty
04:26 - boom keep in mind there's a toggle right
04:28 - here between Objective C and Swift and
04:30 - for Swift we're going to do something
04:33 - like this so we have to create a
04:35 - reference to the database by creating a
04:37 - new firebase object and passing in this
04:41 - URL so this one was the one that you saw
04:43 - in the dashboard for our app it points
04:45 - it points to the database where we're
04:48 - going to read and write data and then
04:49 - very simply to write data all you have
04:52 - to do is call set value on the database
04:55 - so in this lesson we're not actually
04:57 - going to do that yet we're just going to
05:00 - finish installing the cocoa pod and
05:02 - we're going to import firebase there
05:04 - it's done it's open up our project
05:08 - directory XC workspace and at this point
05:11 - I like to press command B to build the
05:13 - project just to make sure that nothing's
05:15 - wrong it's gonna compile the firebase
05:18 - libraries as well all right that's
05:20 - awesome
05:20 - so here in the view controller we want
05:23 - it to connect to the database we would
05:25 - import firebase here and then we would
05:27 - follow those instructions to write some
05:29 - data so we're gonna do that in the next
05:30 - lesson and I'm also going to show you
05:32 - how you can centralize all of those
05:34 - database writing and reading statements
05:36 - so that you're not connecting to the
05:38 - firebase database and reading and
05:39 - writing data all over the place it's
05:41 - gonna be really messy and hard to keep
05:43 - track of so we'll probably gonna want to
05:45 - create a database manager or something
05:47 - like that a new class that's gonna
05:49 - encapsulate all of those methods that
05:51 - interact with the database okay thanks
05:53 - for watching and I'll see you guys in
05:54 - the next lesson talk to you guys later
05:56 - bye
