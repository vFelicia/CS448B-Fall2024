00:00 - hey code crew it's chris here so i have
00:02 - a dilemma
00:03 - i am running out of hard drive space as
00:05 - you can see here my hard disk is
00:08 - 250 gigs i've got 11 gigs left
00:11 - so that means about 237 gigs are taken
00:14 - up
00:15 - so i have this tool called grand
00:17 - perspective and it lets you visualize
00:19 - what's on your hard drive now this tool
00:21 - isn't free
00:22 - it's you can get it from the mac app
00:25 - store for about ten dollars i think
00:27 - um however there might be other free
00:29 - tools that do this and this is not even
00:31 - very necessary but i just wanted to walk
00:33 - through
00:33 - visually what is taking up the space and
00:36 - then
00:36 - we're gonna go through and delete all of
00:40 - the unnecessary
00:41 - xcode files and outdated files old files
00:44 - that are no longer needed and we're
00:45 - going to see how much hard drive space
00:47 - we can actually save
00:48 - so the xcode app itself is about 15 gigs
00:51 - as you can see here
00:53 - these are all just different
00:54 - applications but if you take a look at
00:57 - this part xcode drive data this is eight
01:01 - gigs
01:02 - moving on to the left this is xcode user
01:04 - data that's 12 gigs
01:07 - this is xcode ios device support 8 gigs
01:11 - this is xcode archives four gigs this is
01:14 - watch os
01:15 - support and that's that's kind of small
01:17 - but this big chunk right here
01:19 - core simulator devices again is related
01:21 - to xcode this is a whopping 37 gigs
01:25 - down here core simulator caches 10 gigs
01:29 - and the rest of the rest of this stuff
01:31 - is just like old zoom calls and stuff
01:33 - but
01:33 - you can see i i would say about half the
01:36 - hard drive
01:37 - is taken up by xcode related stuff
01:40 - so let's dive in and let's take a look
01:43 - at what we don't need and free up a ton
01:45 - of hard drive space i'm going to show
01:47 - you exactly what folders you can get rid
01:49 - of
01:49 - and you tell me how much hard drive
01:51 - space you're going to save the longer
01:53 - you've used xcode the more hard drive
01:54 - space you're going to save
01:56 - all right let's take a look so while i
01:58 - was looking for a solution
02:00 - to figure out what folders i can delete
02:02 - i came across this blog article which
02:05 - was really helpful so we are going to
02:07 - follow this list here and we're going to
02:09 - attack these folders and see
02:11 - systematically
02:12 - how much space we can save so if any of
02:14 - these folders
02:15 - that it's pointing to you can't find it
02:18 - or you can't see it
02:19 - it might be hidden so there it's really
02:22 - easy to show
02:22 - hidden files command shift plus
02:25 - full stop or period and that will toggle
02:29 - on hidden files
02:30 - or toggle them off all right so let's go
02:34 - for the first one right here
02:36 - it's going to be in your hard drive your
02:38 - users
02:40 - your own personal folder and then
02:43 - library and then developer that's where
02:46 - you're going to find
02:47 - the majority of all this xcode simulator
02:50 - stuff
02:51 - so the first folder is core simulator
02:53 - devices
02:54 - so each time you open up the simulator
02:58 - and you restore you erase all settings
03:01 - and content
03:02 - you're essentially spinning up a
03:04 - different
03:06 - device so each of those has its own sort
03:09 - of id
03:10 - and over the years as we can see if i go
03:12 - into this devices folder
03:14 - and take a look at the dates on these it
03:17 - goes back all the way to
03:18 - 2015 and this folder itself let's see
03:22 - how much space
03:23 - i would be saving here uh it's
03:26 - calculating the size
03:28 - but essentially i'm going to get rid of
03:29 - all of it okay there are so many folders
03:33 - in this devices folder that is taking
03:35 - forever to calculate the size
03:37 - so i'm gonna pull up my grand
03:38 - perspective again and
03:40 - this is that folder as you can see that
03:43 - path down there core simulator slash
03:45 - devices this is
03:46 - 37 gigs so that's what i'm going to blow
03:50 - away right now
03:52 - delete and it's going to go into the
03:53 - trash and i'm going to empty it
03:55 - ah there 34 gigs all right so that's
03:58 - gone
03:58 - that's awesome okay and i know it says
04:02 - you can run a terminal here but i
04:05 - basically got rid of everything so the
04:06 - next time i start the ios simulator
04:08 - in xcode it's going to be a fresh device
04:11 - and it's going to create one folder
04:14 - okay so you i guess you periodically
04:16 - have to go in and clear this out
04:18 - okay the next one is xcode device
04:21 - support so let's go under xcode
04:26 - device support and i don't have any old
04:29 - uh ios versions here if you do have ones
04:32 - that you don't use anymore if you've
04:34 - been using xcode for a long time you'll
04:35 - have those and you can get rid of them
04:37 - if you don't plan on you know testing
04:39 - with them or anything like that so i've
04:40 - just got
04:41 - these two newer ones ios 14s so
04:44 - we'll leave that and let's go into here
04:47 - now
04:47 - core simulator cache
04:53 - right here let's see how big this folder
04:56 - is
04:57 - okay this one's about 10 gigs pretty
05:00 - respectable
05:01 - and it says just delete each directory
05:03 - so i'm going to go inside and delete
05:05 - that one right there it says you know
05:08 - delete all the subfolders within this
05:10 - dyld i don't even know what that stands
05:12 - for
05:13 - but there goes 10 gigs either way okay
05:15 - xcode derived data so this one is
05:17 - actually
05:18 - uh it gets cleared out pretty often
05:23 - i would think this one's 1.26 gig so
05:26 - it's not too much
05:27 - whenever xcode is you know something
05:30 - isn't working with xcode
05:32 - or you know you don't have autocomplete
05:34 - it's not picking up
05:35 - or you're getting build errors when you
05:37 - know there shouldn't be
05:39 - one of the most common pieces of advice
05:42 - you'll hear
05:43 - is to delete derived data and restart
05:46 - xcode
05:47 - so what's inside this derived data
05:50 - folder
05:51 - if you want a detailed read i'll link to
05:53 - this article below
05:54 - but essentially it's a bunch of log
05:58 - files a bunch of cache
05:59 - a bunch of index files you know when you
06:03 - first load your project and at the top
06:04 - status bar xcode says
06:06 - we're indexing all the files in your
06:08 - project well
06:09 - that's that's what it's writing to so
06:11 - you can safely delete
06:12 - all of these uh folders uh even if it's
06:16 - for a project you're currently working
06:18 - on because as soon as you launch that
06:19 - project
06:20 - it's going to regenerate this folder for
06:22 - you so
06:23 - there goes that 1.26 gigs saved
06:27 - and here xcode archives next one
06:32 - xcode archives
06:35 - so these are the archives that you
06:36 - create um
06:38 - you know right before you submit your
06:41 - app or you're building an archive for
06:42 - another purpose
06:44 - and if these are old and you don't need
06:46 - them you can go ahead and delete them
06:48 - so how much space am i saving here
06:52 - all right almost five gigs
06:56 - there goes that and log files device
06:59 - logs
07:00 - so i think these are the log files when
07:02 - you plug in
07:03 - like your actual devices and oftentimes
07:05 - you'll see it's downloading
07:07 - uh device logs and stuff like that i
07:09 - think that's
07:10 - where this goes ios device logs
07:14 - okay so let's see how much space i'm
07:15 - saving
07:18 - oh this one's not much at all 57 megs
07:24 - okay actually these files um let me just
07:27 - undo that for a second
07:29 - you see these files dot db dot db
07:32 - dash shm dot db dash
07:35 - wal i noticed
07:38 - a bunch of those files here outside this
07:41 - folder to developer portal right so i
07:44 - guess these are just log
07:45 - files as well um they don't say
07:48 - in this blog article to delete those
07:51 - you know so let me delete these
07:55 - device logs first um i don't know if i
07:59 - can delete these
08:00 - but if you look at some of these files
08:02 - 2015
08:03 - they haven't been modified so i think i
08:06 - can safely delete them even these ones
08:08 - 2017 i'm gonna
08:09 - just go ahead and delete those if
08:11 - something bad happens
08:13 - you'll i'll let you know and i'll admit
08:15 - this video but
08:16 - those seem like just log files to me so
08:18 - i got rid of them
08:20 - okay and that does it for this um
08:24 - this blog article right here however i
08:27 - noticed that
08:29 - there is another part which is taking up
08:31 - a lot of space
08:32 - so if i take a look at this
08:36 - this file right here the developer slash
08:40 - slash xcpg devices
08:43 - so let me just open up this folder
08:47 - right this folder right here
08:51 - not devices but x
08:55 - cpg devices if i
08:58 - you know there are a lot of folders in
09:00 - this folder so it'll probably take a
09:02 - while to calculate the size
09:04 - but if i take a look at this is this
09:08 - 2.261 gigs
09:10 - but this is the same folder all here let
09:13 - me just
09:14 - expand the focus yeah so this entire
09:17 - folder is 7 gigs
09:18 - developer slash xcpg devices
09:22 - and i yeah eight gigs and i don't know
09:24 - if i can delete this
09:27 - because it wasn't listed in this article
09:30 - so i just googled it
09:31 - and i found this other article which
09:34 - seems to be a little more
09:36 - thorough there seems to be a lot more
09:38 - things that it lists
09:40 - that you can delete but it's also chock
09:42 - full of ads
09:43 - um so i don't know if i'll link to this
09:45 - this
09:47 - article but
09:51 - it does list developer xcpg devices
09:55 - and it's saying these are playground
09:57 - project
09:58 - cache files so that makes sense xc
10:00 - probably stands for xcode
10:02 - pg stands for playground and devices are
10:05 - just
10:05 - you know every time you open a new
10:08 - playground
10:09 - and uh when you run the code it says
10:12 - it's starting the simulator
10:14 - i think probably behind the scenes what
10:16 - it's doing is it's spinning up a new
10:17 - device
10:19 - so then this is where it's creating
10:22 - those
10:24 - those files now that's just a guess
10:27 - where was that again library developer
10:32 - inside the xcode folder okay here it is
10:36 - x cpg devices so i'm going to go ahead
10:39 - and
10:40 - i don't know if i can delete that file
10:41 - though um
10:43 - so i'm going to delete the folders
10:45 - because i know these these
10:47 - ids right here these are device ids i
10:49 - don't know if i can get rid of that
10:51 - file so i'm just going to get rid of the
10:53 - folders
10:54 - i'm sure that will be regenerated
10:56 - actually if i take a look at the date
10:59 - you can see some of them are pretty old
11:00 - as well 2015.
11:03 - so i'll delete all those and now
11:06 - let us empty the trashcan
11:12 - and see how much space we save so here
11:15 - it is again
11:16 - um 237 gigs taken up
11:21 - let's empty the trash
11:28 - and this might take a while
11:32 - all right so it's finally done it got
11:34 - rid of something like 600
11:35 - 000 files and i had about 10 gigs left
11:40 - over so it looks like i saved about
11:42 - 63 gigs off of my hard drive
11:45 - that is pretty substantial if i have to
11:48 - say
11:48 - now actually let's launch xcode make
11:51 - sure it still launches and make sure
11:53 - everything still works okay so um
11:57 - why don't we give that a try
12:04 - so actually now when i build it it's
12:05 - going to be launching a brand new
12:07 - simulator
12:08 - it's going to be creating a new device
12:10 - because i deleted all of them
12:11 - so take a look here uh you can see
12:15 - inside derived data see it's created a
12:18 - new folder
12:19 - for this project so it's okay to delete
12:21 - everything in there
12:22 - but also inside core simulator inside
12:24 - devices you can see that
12:26 - this is being spun up now this is my new
12:28 - simulator device
12:30 - that it is in the process of launching
12:32 - and creating
12:35 - uh there it is um
12:39 - okay that's not good so
12:46 - let me take a look here
12:50 - you know what let me try to
12:53 - close this relaunch it
12:57 - i might actually have to reboot my
12:58 - system first
13:03 - um what i'm going to do is i'm also
13:06 - going to clean the build folder
13:10 - let's try that again and if this fails
13:14 - i'm going to reboot the system and see
13:16 - what happens
13:20 - okay actually this time it is working so
13:23 - uh
13:23 - let's see did i create this a different
13:25 - one no this is the same one
13:28 - so i don't know what happened there but
13:31 - everything looks okay so far
13:33 - so i hope that was helpful for you if
13:35 - you tried this let me know
13:37 - how much hard drive space you saved by
13:39 - leaving a quick comment below
13:41 - thanks for watching i'll see you guys in
13:42 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey code crew it's chris here so i have a dilemma i am running out of hard drive space as you can see here my hard disk is 250 gigs i've got 11 gigs left so that means about 237 gigs are taken up so i have this tool called grand perspective and it lets you visualize what's on your hard drive now this tool isn't free it's you can get it from the mac app store for about ten dollars i think um however there might be other free tools that do this and this is not even very necessary but i just wanted to walk through visually what is taking up the space and then we're gonna go through and delete all of the unnecessary xcode files and outdated files old files that are no longer needed and we're going to see how much hard drive space we can actually save so the xcode app itself is about 15 gigs as you can see here these are all just different applications but if you take a look at this part xcode drive data this is eight gigs moving on to the left this is xcode user data that's 12 gigs this is xcode ios device support 8 gigs this is xcode archives four gigs this is watch os support and that's that's kind of small but this big chunk right here core simulator devices again is related to xcode this is a whopping 37 gigs down here core simulator caches 10 gigs and the rest of the rest of this stuff is just like old zoom calls and stuff but you can see i i would say about half the hard drive is taken up by xcode related stuff so let's dive in and let's take a look at what we don't need and free up a ton of hard drive space i'm going to show you exactly what folders you can get rid of and you tell me how much hard drive space you're going to save the longer you've used xcode the more hard drive space you're going to save all right let's take a look so while i was looking for a solution to figure out what folders i can delete i came across this blog article which was really helpful so we are going to follow this list here and we're going to attack these folders and see systematically how much space we can save so if any of these folders that it's pointing to you can't find it or you can't see it it might be hidden so there it's really easy to show hidden files command shift plus full stop or period and that will toggle on hidden files or toggle them off all right so let's go for the first one right here it's going to be in your hard drive your users your own personal folder and then library and then developer that's where you're going to find the majority of all this xcode simulator stuff so the first folder is core simulator devices so each time you open up the simulator and you restore you erase all settings and content you're essentially spinning up a different device so each of those has its own sort of id and over the years as we can see if i go into this devices folder and take a look at the dates on these it goes back all the way to 2015 and this folder itself let's see how much space i would be saving here uh it's calculating the size but essentially i'm going to get rid of all of it okay there are so many folders in this devices folder that is taking forever to calculate the size so i'm gonna pull up my grand perspective again and this is that folder as you can see that path down there core simulator slash devices this is 37 gigs so that's what i'm going to blow away right now delete and it's going to go into the trash and i'm going to empty it ah there 34 gigs all right so that's gone that's awesome okay and i know it says you can run a terminal here but i basically got rid of everything so the next time i start the ios simulator in xcode it's going to be a fresh device and it's going to create one folder okay so you i guess you periodically have to go in and clear this out okay the next one is xcode device support so let's go under xcode device support and i don't have any old uh ios versions here if you do have ones that you don't use anymore if you've been using xcode for a long time you'll have those and you can get rid of them if you don't plan on you know testing with them or anything like that so i've just got these two newer ones ios 14s so we'll leave that and let's go into here now core simulator cache right here let's see how big this folder is okay this one's about 10 gigs pretty respectable and it says just delete each directory so i'm going to go inside and delete that one right there it says you know delete all the subfolders within this dyld i don't even know what that stands for but there goes 10 gigs either way okay xcode derived data so this one is actually uh it gets cleared out pretty often i would think this one's 1.26 gig so it's not too much whenever xcode is you know something isn't working with xcode or you know you don't have autocomplete it's not picking up or you're

right so it's finally done it got rid of something like 600 000 files and i had about 10 gigs left over so it looks like i saved about 63 gigs off of my hard drive that is pretty substantial if i have to say now actually let's launch xcode make sure it still launches and make sure everything still works okay so um why don't we give that a try so actually now when i build it it's going to be
