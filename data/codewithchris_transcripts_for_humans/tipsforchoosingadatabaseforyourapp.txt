00:00 - hey code peeps how's it going I know
00:02 - this isn't my usual setting but I just
00:04 - got some new grass laid out in the
00:06 - backyard so I'm trying to spend a little
00:07 - more time outside I thought I record
00:09 - this video here I hope it's not too
00:11 - distracting for you guys anyways last
00:14 - week we talked about a few database
00:16 - options that you can choose for your
00:17 - mobile app in this short video I want to
00:20 - give you some tips about how to choose
00:22 - the best one for your specific situation
00:25 - now I think a lot of what I'm going to
00:27 - be saying is kind of common sense but I
00:30 - wanted to record this video anyway just
00:32 - in case it helps even a small group of
00:35 - people so sound good alright let's get
00:38 - started with step one so the first thing
00:42 - you should consider are you building a
00:44 - companion app for an existing product or
00:47 - service if so then chances are there's
00:49 - already an existing database for that
00:52 - product or service that your app is
00:54 - going to have to integrate with and so
00:57 - the decision is pretty much made for you
00:59 - there's no choice for you you're gonna
01:02 - have to read and integrate with whatever
01:04 - database that existing product or
01:06 - service uses ok so what if you're
01:09 - building an app from scratch then we
01:11 - move on to step 2 if you're building an
01:15 - app then I'm assuming that you have some
01:17 - sort of idea about what it's supposed to
01:19 - do right well the more clear you can be
01:22 - about what your app does and what it
01:24 - doesn't do the better off you'll be
01:26 - because you're going to use those
01:27 - requirements to narrow down the choices
01:29 - of database each database has its own
01:33 - strengths and weaknesses and in this
01:35 - step you basically take your business
01:37 - requirements and technical requirements
01:39 - and cross off any options off the list
01:42 - which don't fit your needs
01:44 - I know in this face you're gonna have to
01:46 - do a little bit of research maybe ask
01:48 - some questions and find out which
01:51 - database option actually would work for
01:54 - your requirements and don't forget last
01:56 - week I released a video introducing a
01:58 - few of the options that are available to
02:00 - you so make sure you check that out if
02:02 - you haven't already so after you've
02:04 - finished with this step you're left with
02:06 - several options all of which fit your
02:08 - technical and business requirements
02:10 - on to step three now it's time to look
02:15 - at your end goal so is the goal to get
02:18 - this app or prototype up and running as
02:20 - soon as possible with the least amount
02:22 - of risk and the highest chance of
02:24 - success in that case doesn't it make
02:27 - sense to stick with something that you
02:28 - are familiar with and that's exactly my
02:31 - recommendation if that is your goal make
02:33 - sense however if this is let's say a pet
02:36 - project or some sort of demo that you're
02:39 - building and it's not mission-critical
02:43 - then you have some chance to experiment
02:45 - maybe your goal is to learn a new skill
02:47 - or work with a new database and expand
02:49 - your toolset in that case you should
02:51 - choose something out of the remaining
02:53 - options that interests you now if this
02:56 - still doesn't help you narrow it down to
02:58 - a single option then we move on to step
03:00 - four chances are if you're at this step
03:04 - then there may be a possibility that
03:06 - maybe you haven't worked with many
03:08 - database options before so you don't
03:10 - have a preference as to which one and
03:12 - you're not really sure which one is
03:14 - right for your app still in that case I
03:16 - have a couple of recommendations for you
03:18 - for a local databases I recommend using
03:20 - realm because it's very easy to set up
03:22 - and it's very beginner friendly it's
03:24 - very easy to use and understand for
03:27 - remote databases I recommend looking
03:29 - into firebase for much of the same
03:30 - reasons and also a lot of people are
03:32 - looking to do things like account
03:35 - registrations and logins and they want
03:37 - to integrate analytics and firebase has
03:39 - a great platform for you to integrate a
03:42 - lot of those features into your app in
03:45 - the upcoming videos you're gonna see me
03:47 - using a lot of both of these options
03:49 - alright so I don't think what I've said
03:51 - here in this video is rocket science but
03:53 - I hope these guiding principles helps
03:55 - even a small group of you guys who are
03:58 - unsure about what to use I hope it's
04:00 - been helpful for you guys if you like
