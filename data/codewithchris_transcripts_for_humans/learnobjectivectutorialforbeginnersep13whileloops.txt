00:08 - hey guys in this episode we're going to
00:10 - learn about while Loops in Objective C
00:12 - which builds upon what you learned last
00:14 - time about for Loops all right let's get
00:17 - started so to follow along you can
00:19 - download this exact X code project in
00:21 - the link down below or the link on the
00:24 - screen there are two Loops that we're
00:25 - going to look at today the first one is
00:27 - the do while loop so it looks like this
00:30 - do some sort of statements while some
00:33 - condition is true so let me show you
00:35 - what that looks
00:37 - like so let's declare an age variable
00:41 - again and then in the do loop I could do
00:45 - something like age ++ and last video uh
00:50 - we talked about h++ means that you're
00:53 - incrementing age by one every time and
00:56 - in my condition I can say do this while
00:59 - age is less than 10 so it's going to
01:02 - keep looping this statement h++ until
01:05 - the value of AG is 10 or greater now the
01:09 - second Loop is almost a reverse of that
01:12 - it's while some condition execute this
01:15 - sort of statements or the set of
01:17 - statements rather
01:19 - so
01:21 - while while some condition execute a
01:24 - bunch of statements so while AG is less
01:27 - than
01:28 - 10
01:31 - h++ so in this loop it's saying that if
01:34 - the value of age is less than 10 then
01:37 - run this statement and keep doing that
01:39 - until this condition is true now at a
01:42 - first glance the two Loops might seem
01:45 - similar and they are but the difference
01:47 - is that with the do while loop this set
01:50 - of statements will always get executed
01:52 - once before it checks the condition this
01:55 - condition check happens after the set of
01:57 - statements executes once while in this
02:00 - Loop the condition is checked before the
02:03 - loop happens so that's really the main
02:07 - difference so now you know about the
02:09 - while loop and the for Loop you'll find
02:12 - that these two concepts the while uh the
02:15 - while loop and the for Loop exists in
02:16 - many other programming languages not
02:18 - only objective c so in the future if you
02:21 - want to learn other types of programming
02:23 - uh they'll come in handy for your fact
02:26 - to the day did you know that Apple used
02:29 - to be called Apple computer and it was
02:31 - only in 2007 that it removed the word
02:35 - computer from its name and just called
02:37 - itself Apple to reflect that it was also
02:40 - not only doing computers but also uh
02:43 - doing consumer
02:45 - [Music]
02:58 - electronics
