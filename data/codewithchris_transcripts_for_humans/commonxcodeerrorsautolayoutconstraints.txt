00:05 - hello welcome to this lesson where I'm
00:09 - going to show you some common auto
00:11 - layout constraint errors and how to fix
00:13 - them so you can add Auto layout
00:16 - constraints in two ways one is through
00:18 - the storyboard like I'm about to show
00:20 - you and the second way is
00:22 - programmatically through Swift code I'm
00:24 - going to show you both ways but we're
00:26 - gonna start with the storyboard version
00:29 - so first let me just put the text field
00:32 - onto the view and I'm going to add some
00:37 - constraints to it now by horizontally
00:41 - and vertically centering it in the
00:43 - container and then I'm gonna go here and
00:46 - select update frames and you can see how
00:48 - it's so small because I don't have any
00:50 - height and width constraints to it so
00:52 - I'm gonna select that click this icon
00:54 - right here and I'm gonna add a height
00:57 - and a width so for width I'm gonna add a
00:59 - hundred and for height I'm gonna put 40
01:01 - so let's add these two constraints now
01:04 - let's update frames again and now we
01:08 - have this text field that's in the
01:10 - center now sometimes because you have so
01:12 - many elements on the screen and you're
01:15 - adding so many constraints that you can
01:17 - accidentally add constraints that would
01:19 - conflict with the constraints that you
01:22 - have already added so in other words
01:24 - that element can't simultaneously
01:27 - satisfy all of the constraints that
01:30 - you've put on it and remember constraint
01:33 - is nothing more than a rule so if you're
01:35 - you know having two rules here saying
01:37 - that it should be horizontally centered
01:39 - in the screen and vertically centered on
01:41 - the screen and then I'm going to add
01:43 - another rule to say that it should be
01:47 - zero margin from the top and zero margin
01:49 - from the left let me add these two so
01:52 - you can see now instantly there's all
01:54 - these red lines because on one hand two
01:58 - of my constraints put the location of
02:00 - the text field up here on the other hand
02:03 - the other two constraints put it in the
02:05 - middle here so you see all these red
02:07 - lines indicating that there are it's an
02:11 - error conflicting constraints
02:13 - you click this red button up here and if
02:16 - you don't see this doc there's a little
02:19 - button here in the lower left hand
02:21 - corner where you can hide and show this
02:23 - document outline so you click this
02:25 - little red guy right here you can see
02:28 - that here are the conflicting
02:30 - constraints and if you just run your
02:32 - mouse over it you can see which ones
02:34 - they are and you can fix them so what
02:36 - happens if I just run the app now which
02:39 - I'm going to do to show you well the
02:42 - system in order to produce a layout it's
02:48 - going to break some constraints in order
02:50 - to satisfy as many constraints as it can
02:53 - so you can see right here there's a
02:55 - faint grey outline along the edges of
02:58 - the simulator you you might have to look
03:01 - hard to notice it but what it's done is
03:03 - it's broken my height and width
03:05 - constraint for the text field so it's
03:09 - broken those two constraints so that it
03:11 - can adhere to the centering constraints
03:16 - as well as the left and top zero margin
03:19 - constraints so by breaking the height
03:22 - and width constraint it's just made my
03:24 - text box or my text field huge in order
03:27 - to satisfy those four constraints the or
03:30 - the two different positioning ones that
03:32 - were conflicting so that's how it would
03:35 - work and furthermore in the console down
03:36 - here you scroll all the way to the top
03:39 - you can see the it tells you unable to
03:42 - simultaneously satisfy the constraints
03:44 - and so that's your indication that
03:48 - something is wrong
03:49 - so when you're laying out these
03:50 - constraints on the storyboard it's it's
03:52 - very easy to see what's wrong or it's
03:55 - really easy to get an idea of what's
03:57 - happening because of all these red lines
03:59 - and actually an aside if you don't see
04:03 - this console what you want to do is make
04:05 - sure that you have this tab highlighted
04:07 - because you can close the console window
04:09 - like that and if you don't have this
04:12 - bottom drawer at all its this top icon
04:14 - here you can hide it and show it okay so
04:18 - now let's go into programmatic
04:20 - constraints so I'm just going to get rid
04:23 - of the text field here
04:26 - so our view is empty and I'm gonna save
04:29 - it I'm going to go into the view
04:30 - controller here I've commented out all
04:34 - of this code but I'm gonna comment them
04:38 - back in and I'm gonna show you with
04:42 - programmatic constraints you can also
04:45 - have errors it's a little harder to
04:48 - debug but in my experience it's usually
04:52 - at least for beginners it's usually one
04:55 - or two different things that could be
04:58 - the problem
05:08 - so just remember when you have an
05:10 - element that you want to add constraints
05:13 - to if you're adding size constraints
05:15 - like I'm doing here
05:17 - adding the height and width you want to
05:19 - add the constraints to the actual
05:21 - element so my text field add constraints
05:26 - now if you're adding layout constraints
05:29 - here be sure to add them to the parent
05:34 - container of the element that you want
05:36 - to position so in this case we want to
05:38 - position the text field right so these
05:40 - two constraints we want to add it to the
05:43 - parent that contains the text field in
05:45 - this case it's the view controllers view
05:47 - so self refers to the view controller
05:50 - because I'm writing this code in side
05:52 - view controller dot Swift and view is
05:55 - the view property of the view controller
05:57 - which references the view and you can
06:01 - see up here that I've placed the text
06:05 - field as a sub view of the view so in
06:09 - other words the view is the parent
06:11 - container of this text field right so
06:14 - that's why I'm adding these positioning
06:15 - constraints to the view now if you added
06:19 - these positioning constraints to the to
06:23 - the text field itself you're gonna get
06:25 - an error I'll show you
06:27 - so let's do my text field dot add
06:31 - constraints and I'm adding these
06:32 - positioning constraints this is gonna
06:34 - cause an error because I'm gonna run it
06:36 - now because remember the positioning
06:40 - constraints you want to add it to the
06:41 - parent container of the element so let's
06:45 - see what we have in the console here we
06:47 - scroll all the way up and you can see it
06:49 - doesn't even highlight the line that is
06:52 - wrong so you can't always rely on this
06:55 - where it's crashing
06:57 - so go into the console here scroll all
06:59 - the way to the top the view hierarchy is
07:01 - not prepared for the constraint so
07:03 - that's your clue that indicates that
07:06 - that might be a problem so check that
07:08 - your size constraints are being applied
07:10 - to the element and your position
07:12 - constraints are being applied to the
07:14 - parent container of the element okay so
07:17 - let's stop this and let's undo
07:20 - so it will run again so that's one
07:23 - common problem that I see another common
07:26 - problem is that when you're adding these
07:28 - position and constraints even though
07:30 - you're adding it to the view you know
07:33 - the container the parent of the element
07:36 - you have to make sure that that element
07:38 - is actually added to the view first so
07:44 - if I forget to add the element to the
07:47 - view you can see up here I've just
07:50 - created it I've created some size
07:52 - constraints then I've added those size
07:54 - constraints to the textfield element and
07:56 - then I proceed to add these positioning
07:58 - constraints to the view but nowhere have
08:03 - I actually put the textfield element
08:05 - into the view and because these two
08:08 - positioning constraints refer to the
08:12 - text field for positioning within that
08:16 - view it can't because the text field
08:19 - actually isn't in the view yet so now if
08:23 - I run it I'll show you what kind of
08:24 - error you get so it crashes scroll up
08:32 - all the way up here in the console the
08:35 - view hierarchy is not prepared for the
08:36 - constraint yep you read that right it's
08:39 - the same error message as the the other
08:42 - mistake that I just showed you right so
08:45 - if you see a mistake like this an error
08:47 - message the view hockey is not prepared
08:49 - for the constraint then you want to
08:51 - check two things first of all if you're
08:53 - positioning that element I'm gonna undo
08:56 - now has that element been added to the
09:00 - container view or the the view and if
09:05 - you're adding positioning constraints
09:06 - are you adding it to the parent
09:09 - container of that element and if you're
09:12 - adding size constraints are you adding
09:14 - it to the element itself so those are
09:18 - the things to check when you get that
09:20 - that sort of error and I see this quite
09:24 - it's quite common so be sure to keep an
09:26 - eye out for it I hope that was helpful
09:28 - to you guys and stay tuned for more
09:30 - helpful videos to help you resolve Xcode
09:32 - err

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to this lesson where I'm going to show you some common auto layout constraint errors and how to fix them so you can add Auto layout constraints in two ways one is through the storyboard like I'm about to show you and the second way is programmatically through Swift code I'm going to show you both ways but we're gonna start with the storyboard version so first let me just put the text field onto the view and I'm going to add some constraints to it now by horizontally and vertically centering it in the container and then I'm gonna go here and select update frames and you can see how it's so small because I don't have any height and width constraints to it so I'm gonna select that click this icon right here and I'm gonna add a height and a width so for width I'm gonna add a hundred and for height I'm gonna put 40 so let's add these two constraints now let's update frames again and now we have this text field that's in the center now sometimes because you have so many elements on the screen and you're adding so many constraints that you can accidentally add constraints that would conflict with the constraints that you have already added so in other words that element can't simultaneously satisfy all of the constraints that you've put on it and remember constraint is nothing more than a rule so if you're you know having two rules here saying that it should be horizontally centered in the screen and vertically centered on the screen and then I'm going to add another rule to say that it should be zero margin from the top and zero margin from the left let me add these two so you can see now instantly there's all these red lines because on one hand two of my constraints put the location of the text field up here on the other hand the other two constraints put it in the middle here so you see all these red lines indicating that there are it's an error conflicting constraints you click this red button up here and if you don't see this doc there's a little button here in the lower left hand corner where you can hide and show this document outline so you click this little red guy right here you can see that here are the conflicting constraints and if you just run your mouse over it you can see which ones they are and you can fix them so what happens if I just run the app now which I'm going to do to show you well the system in order to produce a layout it's going to break some constraints in order to satisfy as many constraints as it can so you can see right here there's a faint grey outline along the edges of the simulator
