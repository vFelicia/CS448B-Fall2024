00:04 - hey everyone my name is Chris and
00:07 - welcome to lesson two of how to make
00:09 - iphone apps with no programming
00:10 - experience in today's lesson we're going
00:13 - to dabble in some Swift code and just
00:15 - get our feet wet what's important in
00:17 - this lesson is I actually want you to
00:19 - try and do it yourself you should have a
00:22 - Mac and you should have Xcode installed
00:24 - from the Mac App Store when you open
00:27 - Xcode for the first time you'll be
00:28 - presented with a menu like this and
00:31 - we're just going to select this one
00:33 - saying get started with the playground
00:36 - if you don't have this Welcome menu you
00:38 - can easily open a new playground by
00:40 - going to file new and select playground
00:43 - from up here so we're not starting a
00:50 - whole new app project here we're using
00:53 - something called a playground which was
00:55 - newly introduced in Xcode 6 and you can
00:57 - think of a playground as just a
00:59 - lightweight way for us to try and test
01:02 - out some code without fully having to
01:04 - commit to starting a new app project
01:06 - we're going to get a chance to create a
01:08 - new app project a couple of videos later
01:10 - but for now I wanted to just get our
01:13 - feet wet and test out some Swift code
01:16 - and the key thing I want you to do is to
01:19 - try it out yourself so launch Xcode on
01:21 - your own laptop and type in what I type
01:24 - in and try it out so for our playground
01:28 - we're presented with a name and a
01:30 - platform so I'm just going to leave that
01:32 - as is I'm going to save it on the
01:35 - desktop ok so see if you can follow
01:39 - along and type what I'm typing in your
01:41 - playground
01:51 - so I'm just going to put a string into
01:53 - this variable message and a string it's
01:56 - just a piece of text think of it like
01:58 - that and it's surrounded by these quotes
02:00 - and this equal sign is me putting this
02:04 - piece of text into a variable called
02:06 - message so this total line of code is me
02:12 - declaring a new variable called message
02:14 - and putting this piece of text into the
02:17 - variable so on the right-hand side of
02:20 - this playground you can see the result
02:22 - of what you just typed and now if I want
02:25 - to print let's say if I go like that it
02:35 - will output hello world because that's
02:38 - what I put it in up there so let's look
02:40 - at some other examples so that's me
02:48 - putting the value 10 into a variable a
03:07 - so you can see here that on the right
03:09 - hand side it kind of gives you a preview
03:13 - of what's happening as you're writing
03:16 - these lines of code so I put in the
03:18 - value 10 into the variable a I put in
03:21 - the value 15 into the variable B and I
03:23 - create a new variable called total which
03:27 - is equal to the sum of a and B so if I
03:31 - wanted to print tol you can see that it
03:37 - is 25 so I hope you've been able to
03:41 - follow along so far let's try something
03:44 - a little different so I'm going to say
03:47 - if total is less than 20 then I want to
03:56 - print the text hello and of course
04:05 - nothing happens because the variable
04:08 - total is a plus B which we know to be
04:12 - equal to 25 which is not less than 20 so
04:16 - it's not going to execute this line
04:19 - right here
04:19 - but let's say if we went up here and
04:22 - change the variable a to be 1 instead
04:25 - now total is 1 plus 15 which is equal to
04:31 - 16 over here as we can see and now this
04:34 - if statement is true total is 16 which
04:37 - is less than 20 and so this line will
04:40 - execute so an if statement just gives us
04:44 - the power to perform some logic and
04:46 - we'll go over that in a future lesson
04:49 - for now don't worry about trying to
04:52 - memorize the syntax or the structure of
04:54 - what we've written so far we're going to
04:56 - go through in detail in the future all
04:58 - of these different Swift mechanics but
05:02 - for right now all I want you to do is to
05:05 - try it out on your own computer open up
05:07 - Xcode open a new playground and type
05:10 - this in and try it out and the reason
05:12 - I'm making you do this is because I
05:14 - found that the most intimidating thing
05:16 - for students when they're learning iOS
05:18 - development is the programming language
05:20 - effect of it and I hope that by
05:23 - following along and typing out these
05:24 - statements you'll find that it's
05:27 - actually very logical and easy to follow
05:29 - pretty straightforward and nothing to be
05:32 - fearful about so that's all I really
05:34 - wanted you to do in the next lesson
05:37 - we're going to create a new app project
05:38 - in Xcode and we're going to walk through
05:40 - the different areas of Xcode so that you
05:43 - can get familiar with it
