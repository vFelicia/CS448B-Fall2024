00:07 - hey guys welcome to another code with
00:09 - Chris lesson and in this video I'll show
00:12 - you guys how to add images to your app
00:14 - and you're probably going to be using
00:16 - images a lot whether you're adding
00:18 - backgrounds for your app or you're you
00:21 - know you're adding icons or just
00:22 - changing the look and feel and the
00:24 - styling of your app it's all done
00:26 - through images so we're going to get
00:28 - started and create a brand new xcode
00:31 - project I'm going to start with a single
00:33 - View
00:34 - application I'm just going to call this
00:38 - image uh image view demo and save it on
00:41 - my
00:45 - desktop and the first thing we're going
00:47 - to do is we're actually going to go to
00:51 - the
00:51 - storyboard and we're going to add an UI
00:56 - image view element to our view and this
00:59 - is the element that's used to add images
01:02 - basically uh each image view element is
01:06 - a single image so make sure that you can
01:09 - see this inspector pane on the right
01:11 - hand
01:12 - side you can click this icon here to
01:15 - reveal it if yours is
01:17 - not and down here in the lower right
01:19 - make sure that you're flipped over to
01:22 - this objects Library Tab and then search
01:25 - for image should pop up image view right
01:29 - here
01:31 - so we're going to drag it over and by
01:34 - default it's going to try to expand uh
01:37 - and fit the whole view this is fine
01:39 - we're uh let's do a background first
01:42 - okay so I've just added my UI image View
01:46 - and it's empty right now so if you look
01:48 - on the right hand side this time on this
01:51 - pane keep in mind there are still a
01:52 - couple of tabs
01:54 - here you want to make sure you're
01:56 - looking at the right one uh there's this
01:58 - drop down here that says image and right
02:00 - now there's nothing in there um so the
02:03 - way that we add an image so that we can
02:05 - select it here is by adding it to the
02:09 - image asset Library looking at the file
02:12 - Navigator here we have this
02:15 - Library this asset Library here and if
02:17 - you click it um it's going to reveal
02:20 - this sort of editor view where you've
02:22 - got a list of uh image sets that you've
02:25 - added to the left these two are default
02:28 - the app icon and the launch image and on
02:30 - the right hand side you have the option
02:32 - to add images so we're going to right
02:36 - click in this area and say New Image
02:39 - set and if you just press enter right
02:41 - now or you just you know single click it
02:44 - there you can rename it I'm going to say
02:47 - I'm going to call this uh
02:50 - background okay and then here there's
02:53 - two different um spots where we can add
02:56 - image so basically I'm not sure if you
02:58 - guys know but most of the newer iPhones
03:02 - are Retina Display and I believe it was
03:06 - um introduced with the iPhone 4 so
03:10 - anything below iPhone 4 like the 3G or
03:13 - 3GS was non retina and so
03:17 - basically when you have an image that
03:19 - you want to add you want two sizes one
03:22 - is the original size which is the 1X and
03:25 - that's for non-retina displays and one
03:28 - which is a higher resolution double the
03:30 - resolution uh essentially double the
03:33 - size of that same image and you're going
03:35 - to add in here and that's used for the
03:37 - retina phones so I happen to have uh an
03:41 - image set right here on my desktop I'm
03:43 - just going to move this editor out of
03:44 - the way and for the background I'm going
03:47 - to add the felt so this is just a green
03:49 - felt background and you'll notice that
03:52 - the file names are similar but not quite
03:54 - so the retina one has this at 2x in the
03:58 - file name and that just tells the system
04:01 - that it's a retina version I'm going to
04:03 - go ahead and drag it into the 2x slot
04:06 - and for the original one I'm going to
04:08 - drag it
04:10 - here okay and if I go back to the
04:14 - storyboard now and I click the image
04:17 - View and then go into the inspector pane
04:20 - here now I can see the image set which
04:23 - I've added and I can select it so let's
04:25 - go ahead and select it so you can see it
04:28 - there now
04:30 - now if I run it I'm going to see this as
04:32 - my background and if you pull down the
04:36 - simulator that you want to run it on as
04:38 - you can see pretty much everything is a
04:41 - retina display nowadays at least for
04:45 - iPhone so I don't even have an option to
04:47 - select a non-retina iPhone
04:55 - simulator yeah so there you go so adding
04:58 - backgrounds you know pretty easy thing
05:00 - to do now if I wanted to add an an image
05:04 - that's not a background it we do the
05:06 - same thing except that you know we just
05:09 - change the size of the image view so for
05:11 - example I can put my image view here in
05:13 - the
05:15 - middle right and I'm going to go to the
05:19 - image asset Library again I'm going to
05:20 - create a new image
05:22 - set I'm going to call it Dice and then
05:25 - I'm going to go back to my desktop where
05:27 - I have my image assets and I'm just
05:29 - going to drag this guy in here drag this
05:34 - guy in
05:37 - here go to main. storyboard so I make
05:41 - sure this image view is highlighted and
05:43 - then I can pick that guy right there so
05:46 - it's stretched you know the The View
05:49 - mode is set to scale to fill um but you
05:53 - know if you pick something like that
05:55 - then it's not going to scale
05:58 - it or you know aspect of fit it's going
06:01 - to try to fit it
06:03 - into uh into your image view Dimensions
06:06 - but it's not going to change the um the
06:09 - aspect ratio of your image and there's a
06:12 - couple other ones that you can
06:13 - experiment
06:15 - with okay so this is you know setting
06:18 - the image using storyboards which is the
06:21 - way that I would recommend for a
06:23 - beginner uh you can also you know create
06:26 - image view elements programmatically and
06:28 - set the images programmatically uh but
06:31 - we'll do that another day as you're
06:33 - going to have to know some objective c
06:35 - code to do that so this was a quick
06:38 - short video to show you guys how to add
06:40 - images hopefully that was uh hopefully
06:43 - you saw how simple and easy that was to
06:45 - do now if you learn something new please
06:48 - help me out share this video with your
06:50 - friends and colleagues I would really
06:51 - appreciate that and if you're interested
06:54 - in learning how to build iPhone apps
06:55 - with no programming experience I urge
06:58 - you to check out my paid video course uh
07:00 - you can click on The annotation or you
07:02 - can check it out in the link in the
07:05 - description below a lot of people have
07:07 - taken it and I've gotten a lot of great
07:10 - feedback on it so I urge you to check
07:12 - that out if it's of interest to you
07:14 - other than that I'll see you guys in the
07:16 - next lesson thanks for watching bye

brand new xcode project I'm going to start with a single View application I'm just going to call this image uh image view demo and save it on my desktop and the first thing we're going to do is we're actually going to go to the storyboard and we're going to add an UI image view element to our view and this is the element that's used to add images basically uh each image view element is a single image so make sure that you can see this inspector pane on the right hand side you can click this icon here to reveal it if yours is not and down here in the lower right make sure that you're flipped

a couple of tabs here you want to make sure you're looking at the right one uh there's this drop down here that says image and right now there's nothing in there um so the way that we add an image so that we can select it here is by adding it to the image asset Library looking at the file Navigator here we have this Library this asset Library here and if you click it um it's going to reveal this sort of editor view where you've got a list of uh image sets that you've added to the left these two are default the app icon and the launch image and on the right hand side you have the option to add images so we're going to right click in this area and say New Image set and if you just press enter right now or you just you know single click it there you can rename it I'm going to say I'm going to call this uh background okay and then here there's two different um spots where we can add image so basically I'm not sure if you guys know but most of the newer iPhones are Retina Display and I believe it was um introduced with the iPhone 4 so anything below iPhone 4 like the 3G or 3GS was non retina and so basically when you have an image that you want to add you want two sizes one is the

background and if you pull down the simulator that you want to run it on as you can see pretty much everything is a retina display nowadays at least for iPhone so I don't even have an option to select a nonretina iPhone simulator yeah so there you go so adding backgrounds you know pretty easy thing to do now if I wanted to add an an image that's not a background it we do the same thing except that
