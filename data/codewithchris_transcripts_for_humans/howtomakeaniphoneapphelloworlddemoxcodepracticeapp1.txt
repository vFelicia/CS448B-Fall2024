00:05 - okay now that you've kind of run your
00:08 - first blank iPhone application we're
00:10 - going to take it a tiny step further and
00:14 - we're going to add a label onto the
00:16 - screen saying hello world that's all
00:19 - we're going to do all right let's get
00:21 - started let's first take a look at this
00:24 - diagram of the Xcode interface just to
00:26 - get ourselves familiarized with the
00:29 - different areas of Xcode because I'm
00:31 - going to be using these names and I want
00:33 - you to know what I'm referring to so
00:35 - this blue area along the left-hand side
00:38 - is the Navigator area which you'll find
00:40 - yourself using a lot it's where it lists
00:42 - all the files of your Xcode project in
00:44 - your app and as soon as you select a
00:46 - file from the Navigator area the code
00:49 - file will show in the editor area and in
00:52 - the case of a zip file which we saw in
00:55 - previous videos the editor area is going
00:58 - to change into an interface builder sort
01:01 - of design interface and below that in
01:04 - the green area is the debug area so this
01:07 - area when when you run a new test your
01:09 - app in the iPhone simulator you use the
01:11 - debug area to to check on specific
01:14 - variables or you get information about
01:16 - any crashes and stuff like that with the
01:19 - yellow area on the right-hand side we're
01:21 - going to be using that area in the hello
01:24 - world demo today and in the yellow area
01:27 - at the bottom half is the library pane
01:28 - and that's where we're going to be
01:30 - dragging UI elements onto the view and
01:32 - then the top half of that yellow area is
01:35 - the inspector pane where it's going to
01:37 - show us all of the different properties
01:38 - that we can customize for that UI
01:40 - element and then if you haven't noticed
01:42 - there's this big round play button in
01:44 - the upper left hand corner as well as a
01:46 - stop button and those two buttons
01:48 - control running and stopping our
01:50 - application in the iPhone simulator
01:52 - alright so with that let's get started
01:55 - right now I've got open our blank demo
01:57 - and we haven't done anything so far
01:59 - aside from create a brand new single
02:01 - view application in Xcode and then hit
02:04 - run and we were able to see a blank gray
02:06 - screen so right here that's the Xcode
02:09 - project I've got open and I've got the
02:11 - view controller dot zip
02:13 - clicked so that's why I see the
02:16 - interface builder area here I'm going to
02:19 - bring my mouse into the lower right hand
02:21 - corner the search bar of the library
02:24 - pane and I'm going to search for a UI
02:26 - label it's there anyways but I just want
02:28 - to demonstrate when you start typing
02:29 - it's going to start filtering out the
02:32 - other UI elements for you so I'm just
02:35 - going to click and I'm going to drag
02:37 - this element onto the view right here
02:40 - now you'll see these blue dotted lines
02:43 - appear and it helps you align the UI
02:46 - element with you know in the center of
02:49 - other elements and now you'll see that
02:51 - the inspector pane is showing all of the
02:55 - different things I can customize with
02:56 - the label there's also a couple of
02:59 - different tabs in the inspector pane so
03:01 - there's the file inspector quick help
03:04 - and all of these other ones and you know
03:08 - some of them deal with positioning of
03:11 - the UI element I want to use this one
03:13 - specifically to change to what the text
03:15 - is and you can even change the font in
03:18 - the color but for now I'm going to
03:19 - change the default word label I'm going
03:22 - to change that to hello world and you
03:26 - can see that our label is actually
03:28 - truncated right now because it's too
03:31 - small so I'm just going to put my mouse
03:33 - on these little handles right here and
03:36 - I'm going to drag it so that it shows it
03:39 - and all I'm going to do is reposition it
03:41 - in the middle so now I've got I've got a
03:44 - UI label in my view and when I click run
03:47 - to show this in the iPhone simulator
03:49 - you're going to see that we have a label
03:54 - so that's it you've created your first
03:57 - very very simple iPhone app and you've
04:00 - customized your first view so
04:02 - congratulations on that in the next
04:04 - video we're going to talk about we're
04:06 - going to do a short recap going to
04:07 - introduce a couple more programming
04:09 - concepts about what you just did here
04:11 - and we'll go on from there in the
04:14 - description below on YouTube there's a
04:16 - link to the notes where you can you can
04:18 - read the tutorial and you can also ask
04:20 - questions and there's an FAQ section and
04:23 - don't forget if you guys are finding
04:25 - these tutorials helpful
04:26 - you're learning please share it on
04:28 - Twitter and Facebook and help me build
04:30 - my audience and share with your friends
04:32 - and colleagues thank you so much and I'm

okay now that you've kind of run your first blank iPhone application we're going to take it a tiny step further and we're going to add a label onto the screen saying hello world that's all we're going to do all right let's get started let's first take a look at this diagram of the Xcode interface just to get ourselves familiarized with the different areas of Xcode because I'm going to be using these names and I want you to know what I'm referring to so this blue area along the lefthand side is the Navigator area which you'll find yourself using a lot it's where it lists all the files of your Xcode project in your app and as soon as you select a file from the Navigator area the code file will show in the editor area and in the case of a zip file which we saw in previous videos the editor area is going to change into an interface builder sort of design interface and below that in the green area is the debug area so this area when when you run a new test your app in the iPhone simulator you use the debug area to to check on specific variables or you get information about any crashes and stuff like that with the yellow area on the righthand side we're going to be using that area in the hello world demo today and in the yellow area at the bottom half is the library pane and that's where we're going to be dragging UI elements onto the view and then the top half of that yellow area is the inspector pane where it's going to show us all of the different properties that we can customize for that UI element and then if you haven't noticed there's this big round play button in the upper left hand corner as well as a stop button and those two buttons control running and stopping our application in the iPhone simulator alright so with that let's get started right now I've got open our blank demo and we haven't done anything so far aside from create a brand new single view application in Xcode and then hit run and we were able to see a blank gray screen so right here that's the Xcode project I've got open and I've got the view controller dot zip clicked so that's why I see the interface builder area here I'm going to bring my mouse into the lower right hand corner the search bar of the library pane and I'm going to search for a UI label it's there anyways but I just want to demonstrate when you start typing it's going to start filtering out the other UI elements for you so I'm just going to click and I'm going to drag this element onto the view right here now you'll see these blue dotted lines appear and it helps you align the UI element with you know in the center of other elements and now you'll see that the inspector pane is showing all of the different things I can customize with the label there's also a couple of different tabs in the inspector pane so there's the file inspector quick help and all of these other ones and you know some of them deal with positioning of the UI element I want to use this one specifically to change to what the text is and you can even change the font in the color but for now I'm going to change the default word label I'm going to change that to hello world and you can see that our label is actually truncated right now because it's too small so I'm just going to put my mouse on these little handles right here and I'm going to drag it so that it shows it and all I'm going to do is reposition it in the middle so now I've got I've got a UI label in my view and when I click run to show this in the iPhone simulator you're going to see that we have a label so that's it you've created your first very very simple iPhone app and you've customized your first view so congratulations on that in the next video we're going to talk about we're going to do a short recap going to introduce a couple more programming concepts about what you just did here and we'll go on from there in the description below on YouTube there's a link to the notes where you can you can read the tutorial and you can also ask questions and there's an FAQ section and don't forget if you guys are finding these tutorials helpful you're learning please share it on Twitter and Facebook and help me build my audience and share with your friends and colleagues thank you so much and I'm going to see you next time bye
