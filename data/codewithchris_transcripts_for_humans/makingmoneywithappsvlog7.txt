00:00 - hello and welcome back so the app design
00:02 - for our mood Tracker app is finalized
00:04 - and development Sprint number three is
00:06 - underway so I'll show you what the
00:08 - design looks like and I'll talk about
00:10 - the Sprint in this Vlog but just in case
00:12 - you're new here this series is raw and
00:14 - unscripted and I share our team's
00:16 - journey in building apps for profit this
00:19 - Vlog entry is dated February 14th 2024
00:22 - with all that said I hope you enjoy
00:25 - hello welcome so in the last Vlog I
00:27 - showed you this design that I had to
00:30 - come up with and just to jog your memory
00:33 - or in case you're joining new here the
00:35 - original mood Tracker app that we were
00:38 - trying to build looked like this and
00:40 - this was me just asking our lead
00:42 - designer to design something it wasn't
00:46 - exactly what I had in mind but then
00:48 - again I didn't tell my designer what I
00:50 - had in mind so that's the first mistake
00:52 - and because I didn't have a clear
00:54 - picture of what I wanted and so the
00:56 - lesson for you is if you are going to
00:58 - ask a designer to to do something for
01:01 - you you have to be pretty explicit and
01:04 - you have to know what you want I think a
01:07 - client that doesn't know what they want
01:08 - is probably the worst thing for any sort
01:10 - of consultant or designer so I decided
01:13 - to take a crack at it to try to get in
01:16 - my head onto paper I use this photo as a
01:19 - reference for the feeling that I was
01:21 - trying to evoke and I I did something
01:23 - like this I want to like a cozy a cozy
01:26 - warm type of feeling of using this app
01:29 - so I used a lot of Browns like Earth
01:32 - Tones and things like that I also used a
01:34 - lot of non-standard things as I as I
01:38 - later realized when JC did his design
01:40 - based off of this okay so once I came up
01:43 - with this I asked JC okay now looking at
01:46 - this do you understand what I'm trying
01:48 - to go for and so he took this and ran
01:52 - with it and redesigned all the screens
01:54 - based off of this feeling and emotion
01:57 - and this is what he came up with
02:01 - so you can see that it's a mixture
02:04 - between the first version and my version
02:07 - and what I actually really appreciate
02:09 - about this is the fact that it looks
02:12 - more of an app that you would see in the
02:14 - App Store what do I mean by
02:17 - that it's hard to put your finger on it
02:19 - like when I was designing this I thought
02:21 - oh this would be good here this would be
02:23 - good here and overall I was pretty happy
02:26 - with it but when I saw how JC went about
02:31 - the design I was like this looks like a
02:34 - professional app because it's using
02:37 - standard controls for example the tab
02:40 - bar and these icons up here if you look
02:43 - at just this screen like this entry
02:45 - screen like this notice this back to top
02:48 - right here and this plus button versus
02:50 - what I had here so if you look at this
02:53 - design right here you will see a stark
02:56 - difference I think that you'll
02:57 - understand what I'm saying if you look
02:59 - at this screen right here versus this
03:03 - screen right here this screen right here
03:05 - this just looks more of an app that you
03:07 - would see in the App Store that you
03:08 - would launch or use on your phone versus
03:11 - something that like this that sort of
03:13 - doesn't look like an iPhone app right it
03:16 - looks now to me it looks a little bit
03:19 - amateurish so it was hard to put my
03:21 - finger on it when I was designing it so
03:24 - anyways I'm pretty happy with it okay so
03:27 - let me walk you through some of the
03:28 - interactions so when you have a bunch of
03:30 - mood entries you we didn't figure out
03:33 - how to edit or delete entries and this
03:35 - is what we came up with so when you tap
03:37 - on an entry you essentially drill down
03:40 - and you can delete it rather than
03:42 - launching you into the logging flow
03:45 - which asks you these questions one by
03:47 - one so we thought okay for example if
03:50 - let's say you just wanted to edit who
03:51 - you were with you would have to walk
03:54 - through step one step two step three
03:56 - step four to get there just to change
03:58 - that option so we came up with this
04:00 - solution which was to allow the user to
04:02 - swipe any one of these properties you
04:05 - could say and edit it and it would
04:08 - launch you into that specific mood entry
04:11 - screen so to to let you make a different
04:15 - selection and so that's how you would
04:17 - edit an
04:19 - entry the other thing is the calendar
04:24 - so the calendar we I identified
04:26 - something pretty funny here that I
04:29 - didn't understand before so my original
04:32 - idea was to use a circle to indicate
04:35 - days that you have logged something and
04:38 - a DOT to indicate that this is the
04:41 - current date so we looked at another
04:45 - example sorry another design where
04:48 - instead of a big circle you would have a
04:50 - little dot if you logged something on
04:52 - that day so you'd end up with a calendar
04:54 - of a lot of little dots here but it
04:57 - didn't feel right because it didn't and
05:00 - it again this was something that was
05:01 - really hard to put my finger on it
05:04 - didn't give the feeling of satisfaction
05:06 - I'm comparing this to like a fitness
05:07 - workout app when I'm logging a workout
05:10 - on that day it feels like a win to me
05:13 - and a big juicy circle around that day
05:16 - that I can clearly see indicates it
05:19 - gives me this feeling of achievement of
05:21 - satisfaction and then when I see a month
05:23 - full of fat circles it feels like I did
05:25 - a lot that month and so that wasn't
05:28 - something that I had been a I wasn't
05:31 - able to identify when I was designing it
05:34 - but then after looking at the
05:35 - alternative of just like having a little
05:38 - indication that there was something
05:39 - logged on that day I realized something
05:41 - was missing so I told JC like I really
05:44 - need a huge indication that something
05:47 - was done on that day because looking at
05:49 - a calendar full of green circles for
05:51 - example it lets me know that hey I've
05:53 - put in a lot of work and I feel good
05:55 - about that so that was a cool real
05:58 - realization
06:01 - about the this log entry screen let me
06:04 - walk you through this so a couple of the
06:06 - interactions we were unsure about we
06:07 - figured out as well so for example
06:10 - originally I had something where if you
06:13 - tap on an option it moves you to the
06:15 - next screen right away so tapping good
06:18 - just zooms you over here tapping overjoy
06:20 - zooms you and I like that because it was
06:22 - quick and it was fast but it didn't
06:25 - allow for certain types of interactions
06:28 - such as pinning a mood let's say I
06:30 - always want to use this mood I want to
06:32 - pin it to the top yeah what we decided
06:35 - would be better was to let the user Make
06:38 - a selection and then have buttons for
06:41 - them to go to the next screen then the
06:43 - user probably feels a little more in
06:45 - control because you can choose one think
06:48 - about it change your mind choose another
06:50 - change your decision and then hit the
06:52 - green button to move on to the next
06:53 - screen you could always use the back
06:55 - button to go back you can always cancel
06:57 - to say hey I actually don't want to log
06:59 - a mood at all we also simplified it
07:02 - because before logging a custom mood
07:05 - like
07:06 - this my idea was that when you type in a
07:10 - custom mood here and you somehow hit
07:13 - save or whatever it would create a a
07:16 - button here for your custom mood so that
07:18 - you can use this in the future so in
07:21 - this design what we're doing is just
07:23 - allowing you to type whatever you want
07:26 - as your mood as a custom mood and then
07:28 - go on to the next screen but it wouldn't
07:30 - save this necessarily for the next time
07:33 - at least I don't think so in this design
07:35 - it looks like it will save it let me
07:37 - reconfirm
07:39 - that so if you confirm sorry if you
07:42 - cancel we have dialogues because you
07:45 - have made some progress on your entry up
07:47 - till this point so we do want to confirm
07:49 - with the user and also a tap and hold
07:52 - interaction is used for pinning a
07:54 - certain mood to the top or maybe
07:56 - deleting a custom mood I think
08:01 - yeah or maybe removing it from a pinned
08:04 - section we're asking about the weather
08:06 - this is what the button looks like for
08:09 - the location services and they'll allow
08:11 - you to use the location who are you with
08:14 - what were you doing where are you of
08:17 - course you don't have to log all of
08:18 - these
08:19 - things
08:21 - we you can log just as as much or as
08:24 - little as you want and hit save and it
08:26 - will save your mood okay so based on
08:30 - this design which is a lot more
08:32 - finalized than what we had before what
08:34 - we had to do is go back to the drawing
08:36 - board in terms of planning the Sprints
08:39 - and reestimate everything based on the
08:41 - new design luckily we did some work
08:43 - already in the first two sprints that we
08:45 - can reuse so not All Is Lost but based
08:48 - on these story points which is an
08:50 - estimation of effort we are going to
08:52 - plan Sprint three working on this app is
08:55 - not our full-time thing we're also
08:57 - supporting students through our training
08:59 - programs and things like that we are
09:01 - only allocating each person eight story
09:04 - points per 2E Sprint so that's where
09:06 - we're at right now I'm excited to see
09:08 - this come more to fruition and now that
09:12 - we have a solid place to start from it's
09:14 - not a changing design I think we can
09:16 - make some real progress so stay tuned
09:19 - and I will update you guys next time
09:20 - thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back so the app design for our mood Tracker app is finalized and development Sprint number three is underway so I'll show you what the design looks like and I'll talk about the Sprint in this Vlog but just in case you're new here this series is raw and unscripted and I share our team's journey in building apps for profit this Vlog entry is dated February 14th 2024 with all
