00:05 - hello in this lesson we're going to go
00:08 - through some of the features of the
00:09 - parse platform as well as sign up for
00:11 - our parse account so I'm on parse dog
00:14 - comma I just clicked into the products
00:16 - section I talked a little bit about what
00:18 - we're going to be using which is this
00:20 - thing called parse core and if you click
00:23 - into that you can see some of the cool
00:24 - things you can do with it so this
00:27 - feature save data in the cloud is
00:29 - primarily the reason we're going to be
00:31 - using it in this demo but if you keep
00:33 - scrolling down there are some other cool
00:36 - things you can do with par score you can
00:40 - make your app social so you can log in
00:42 - via social networks with just a couple
00:45 - lines of code and I've had a chance to
00:48 - use this one as well local data store
00:50 - which is really cool so if your app
00:53 - doesn't have a connection and it can't
00:56 - save data into the parse cloud it can
00:59 - store that data locally and furthermore
01:02 - some data doesn't need to be stored on
01:04 - the cloud so you can store it locally
01:06 - within the app they have this feature
01:11 - where you can have a web presence for
01:13 - your app creating a landing page but I
01:15 - haven't used that one before
01:17 - and if you need to create server-side
01:20 - code may be some sort of processing
01:23 - logic before putting the data into the
01:26 - database you can do that using the parse
01:28 - JavaScript SDK to write that server-side
01:30 - code and then furthermore
01:34 - this is getting into stuff that I
01:35 - haven't used before background jobs you
01:38 - can schedule things to happen so it says
01:40 - here whether that's sending emails or
01:42 - updating data or doing some maybe even
01:45 - running server-side logic and this is
01:50 - what makes it also useful there's a
01:51 - parse dashboard where you can create
01:54 - your table schema but they don't call it
01:57 - a table it's the concept of Records but
01:59 - you can view all of your data in here
02:01 - your analytics and stuff like that
02:03 - through this easy-to-use dashboard which
02:06 - we'll see in a couple lessons later and
02:10 - lastly like I mentioned before one of
02:12 - the benefits
02:13 - using a platform like parse is that this
02:16 - is all they do is to be the best at
02:19 - being a back-end for your app so if your
02:22 - app takes off and gets really popular
02:23 - you don't have to worry about adding
02:25 - servers or making sure that your data is
02:28 - replicated across them and doing load
02:30 - balancing you know and all that sort of
02:31 - stuff that comes with managing it on
02:34 - your own it's very easy to scale up or
02:36 - down and you only get charged for what
02:39 - you use but they have a very generous
02:41 - free tier so you probably won't have to
02:43 - pay for a while unless your app really
02:45 - gets popular and lastly the reason why
02:48 - we're doing this is so that we can share
02:50 - data between different platforms right
02:52 - and across different devices so unlike
02:55 - using cloud kit which is iOS only using
02:59 - parse allows us to say we built an
03:02 - Android app it can also use the same
03:04 - parse back-end instance that is shared
03:07 - with the iOS side okay and what we've
03:11 - gone through now is just par score
03:13 - there's two other modules that we can
03:16 - look at is parse analytics and parse
03:18 - push but I think that's good for now
03:21 - what I want you to do is go up into the
03:23 - upper right hand corner and click sign
03:26 - up and register for an account you can
03:29 - simply register an account using an
03:30 - email and a password or you can log in
03:32 - with one of your social accounts so once
03:35 - you do you'll be brought to a page kind
03:38 - of like this where you have a dashboard
03:39 - and here are just some of the sample
03:41 - apps that I've created to play around
03:43 - with parse but what we are going to want
03:46 - to do is to create a brand new app up
03:49 - here so we could name this let's name it
03:54 - chat app and click create and then it's
03:59 - created so that's really it
04:01 - you've just created a parse back-end
04:03 - instance for your app in the following
04:05 - lessons I'll show you guys how to
04:06 - integrate the parse SDK into your Xcode
04:10 - project so that you can start connecting
04:11 - to this back-end instance and start
04:13 - saving and retrieving data all right
04:15 - I'll see you guys in the next lesson

hello in this lesson we're going to go through some of the features of the parse platform as well as sign up for our parse account so I'm on parse dog comma I just clicked into the products section I talked a little bit about what we're going to be using which is this thing called parse core and if you click into that you can see some of the cool things you can do with it so this feature save data in the cloud is primarily the reason we're going to be using it in this demo but if you keep scrolling down there are some other cool things you can do with par score you can make your app social so you can log in via social networks with just a couple lines of code and I've had a chance to use this one as well local data store which is really cool so if your app doesn't have a connection and it can't save data into the parse cloud it can store that data locally and furthermore some data doesn't need to be stored on the cloud so you can store it locally within the app they have this feature where you can have a web presence for your app creating a landing page but I haven't used that one before and if you need to create serverside code may be some sort of processing logic before putting the data into the database you can do that using the parse JavaScript SDK to write that serverside code and then furthermore this is getting into stuff that I haven't used before background jobs you can schedule things to happen so it says here whether that's sending emails or updating data or doing some maybe even running serverside logic and this is what makes it also useful there's a parse dashboard where you can create your table schema but they don't call it a table it's the concept of Records but you can view all of your data in here your analytics and stuff like that through this easytouse dashboard which we'll see in a couple lessons later and lastly like I mentioned before one of the benefits using a platform like parse is that this is all they do is to be the best at being a backend for your app so if your app takes off and gets really popular you don't have to worry about adding servers or making sure that your data is replicated across them and doing load balancing you know and all that sort of stuff that comes with managing it on your own it's very easy to scale up or down and you only get charged for what you use but they have a very generous free tier so you probably won't have to pay for a while unless your app really gets popular and lastly the reason why we're doing this is so that we can share data between different platforms right and across different devices so unlike using cloud kit which is iOS only using parse allows us to say we built an Android app it can also use the same parse backend instance that is shared with the iOS side okay and what we've gone through now is just par score there's two other modules that we can look at is parse analytics and parse push but I think that's good for now what I want you to do is go up into the upper right hand corner and click sign up and register for an account you can simply register an account using an email and a password or you can log in with one of your social accounts so once you do you'll be brought to a page kind of like this where you have a dashboard and here are just some of the sample apps that I've created to play around with parse but what we are going to want to do is to create a brand new app up here so we could name this let's name it chat app and click create and then it's created so that's really it you've just created a parse backend instance for your app in the following lessons I'll show you guys how to integrate the parse SDK into your Xcode project so that you can start connecting to this backend instance and start saving and retrieving data all right I'll see you guys in the next lesson
