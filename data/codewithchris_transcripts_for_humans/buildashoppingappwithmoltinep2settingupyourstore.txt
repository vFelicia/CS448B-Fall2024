00:04 - hate coders happy Tuesday Chris here
00:07 - with part two of our shopping app series
00:10 - in the previous video I gave you a tour
00:12 - of molten overview of the features and
00:15 - the dashboard well today we're going to
00:17 - get right into building our app starting
00:19 - with creating an account on Moulton and
00:22 - I'll show you guys how to set up your
00:24 - base currency for your store and add a
00:26 - couple of products so when we interact
00:28 - with our Moulton store we're going to be
00:30 - able to retrieve those products through
00:32 - the API so I'm on the Moulton calm home
00:34 - page here and there's a big register
00:37 - button on the right upper right hand
00:38 - corner so that's where I'm going to go
00:40 - to register okay so just a couple of
00:42 - pieces of information here first and
00:45 - last name email address password alright
00:59 - and we're off so I'm not going to
01:01 - provide this information right now skip
01:03 - that getting started we're going to do I
01:05 - OS and a cool little intro we're not
01:11 - going to do this part yet
01:12 - we're going to do that in the next
01:14 - lesson right now we're going to jump
01:16 - straight into our dashboard so let's go
01:20 - up to here from my account let's go into
01:23 - the forge dashboard and here we just
01:27 - specify the information we signed up
01:32 - with and this is going to bring us right
01:38 - into the dashboard of our store like
01:40 - this so depending on where you're doing
01:42 - business there may be a couple of things
01:44 - you want to change off the bat by
01:46 - default your store is in British pounds
01:49 - I want to do a store in US currency so
01:52 - I'm going to go into advanced I'm going
01:56 - to jump into currencies and I'm going to
01:59 - create a brand new currency and then
02:00 - we're going to delete the British pound
02:02 - one so I'm going to click create
02:04 - currency and for code we're going to put
02:08 - in USD for title we'll put in
02:12 - usdollar enabled is yes and for modifier
02:18 - because it's the base currency I'm not
02:20 - going to put anything in here maybe just
02:22 - plus zero so the modifier field just
02:25 - allows us to specify some amount to add
02:28 - subtract or multiply to the product
02:32 - amount if we choose to do so for this
02:34 - currency an example of where you may
02:36 - want to do this is if you want to charge
02:39 - the customer something extra for
02:41 - transacting in a certain currency
02:43 - because maybe your payment gateway or
02:44 - bank charges you extra fees for
02:46 - transacting in that currency and then
02:48 - next we have exchange rate so because I
02:50 - want the u.s. dollar to be our base
02:53 - currency I'm going to put one there but
02:55 - if you wanted to display your store
02:57 - product prices in multiple currencies
02:59 - you would create different currencies
03:02 - and then you can specify your own
03:04 - exchange rate so it will update the
03:06 - price based on the exchange rate and I
03:08 - want to make this the default currency
03:10 - so I'm going to say yes and then I'm
03:12 - going to hit submit oh I forgot one
03:16 - thing format field is required so there
03:18 - is a little tab over here where you can
03:21 - specify how you want this currency to be
03:23 - formatted so here's an example because
03:25 - the currency symbol may be different and
03:27 - so you have the flexibility to customize
03:30 - that here so ours is just going to be
03:32 - dollar sign curly brace price and close
03:37 - the curly brace so the decimal point the
03:40 - symbol we want to use is a dot and the
03:42 - thousand point comma and I'm not going
03:45 - to specify any rounding here but you can
03:47 - do rounding like this okay so we're
03:50 - going to submit that and we've created
03:53 - our currency so let's go back to the
03:55 - list of currencies now we can see that
03:57 - our US dollar is the default one and I'm
04:01 - going to delete the British pound one
04:02 - and then now we're going to go on and
04:06 - create some products in our inventory
04:10 - so no products found that's expected I'm
04:14 - going to hit create product up here and
04:16 - let's say that I'm an authorized Apple
04:18 - reseller so to go with the theme let's
04:21 - sell some Apple products
04:24 - let's say we have a MacBook Pro and this
04:27 - slug is going to be part of the product
04:29 - URL
04:32 - so status I'm going to leave as draft
04:35 - but when we want to hit live then we
04:37 - just change this drop-down to live
04:40 - description great laptop category we
04:48 - have to select one and by default
04:50 - there's an uncharacterrized so we're
04:52 - going to do that but we can create more
04:55 - categories under here and we then can
04:58 - add multiple categories next we've got
05:00 - brand but this is an optional field I
05:03 - don't have any brands set up but again
05:05 - you can set up something here on the
05:07 - left hand side for the different brands
05:08 - and I guess for us it would just be
05:10 - Apple for collection if you wanted to
05:13 - create different collections of products
05:15 - for example if you're a clothing
05:17 - retailer you could do something like a
05:18 - fall collection
05:19 - winter collection that sort of thing you
05:22 - can set up your collections here as well
05:24 - okay so for SKU that's just going to be
05:27 - our product identifier so I'm just going
05:30 - to call it MVP and for price let's say
05:35 - $1,400 stock level we've only got ten
05:40 - and it's in stock and catalogue only you
05:44 - have an option of nowhere yes if you
05:46 - selected yes then this product is only
05:49 - for show in the catalog and it cannot be
05:51 - added to cart so I'm going to select no
05:53 - because I want the customers to be able
05:55 - to buy it I also have instead of any tax
05:57 - bands and you would do that under the
06:00 - advanced option here so I'm just going
06:02 - to leave it at default and then lastly
06:04 - you can specify all of these
06:06 - measurements and the weight and require
06:09 - shipping or not so I'm going to say yes
06:11 - alright so finally we're going to hit
06:12 - submit and create our first product
06:16 - there's also a couple of other options
06:18 - here if you wanted to add images to your
06:22 - product you can do so in this tab right
06:24 - here and you can just drag and drop your
06:27 - images there so one of the things I
06:29 - found when I was working with Moulton
06:31 - just setting up some demos and some
06:33 - tests is that their support is really
06:35 - great so if you have a question about
06:36 - any of these fields or how to do
06:39 - anything with your store simply reach
06:41 - out there's this little button here you
06:42 - can always reach out and get help pretty
06:44 - quickly I'm going to go back to products
06:46 - I'm going to add another one so that we
06:50 - have something to see let's call this
06:52 - the iPad pro actually we need to set
06:59 - that one to live so let's just set this
07:01 - one to live right now we need to do that
07:03 - for the category uncharacterized I don't
07:16 - even know how much this thing is I think
07:18 - it's $1,000 okay so let's go back to the
07:28 - products and let's switch the MacBook
07:31 - Pro to live first before we forget there
07:35 - it is
07:38 - and let's just create one more
08:01 - maybe it's $2,000 or something like that
08:07 - alright so we've got three products in
08:09 - our store which is going to be
08:11 - sufficient for our demo a couple of
08:16 - other things before we end this video
08:17 - under advance we're probably going to
08:20 - want to set up a gateway if you're going
08:23 - to be running your store live for our
08:25 - demo we're not going to set up an actual
08:27 - gateway here but just to show you how
08:29 - easy it is I actually use on my website
08:32 - stripe and all you have to do is take
08:35 - the API key from stripe and put it into
08:37 - here and I also use PayPal Express and
08:41 - you can configure that here so all these
08:44 - details is available through your PayPal
08:47 - account and you just have to fill them
08:48 - out here to enable this gateway another
08:51 - thing that we didn't do and just to
08:53 - mention that they have a ton of gateway
08:55 - so chances are you will find the one
08:57 - that you used in here as well I'm going
09:00 - to go to the settings and change my time
09:02 - zone so Eastern is the one that I'm in
09:09 - alright so now we've set the time zone
09:12 - the currency we've setup some products
09:14 - and if this were your live store you'd
09:16 - probably want to set up some gateways
09:18 - and shipping rules as well if you're
09:20 - actually shipping products out so you
09:23 - could do that through here and taxes if
09:25 - you're going to be remitting taxes so
09:27 - we're going to go back to the dashboard
09:30 - and under my account here in the next
09:34 - lesson we're going to actually take the
09:37 - API keys we're going to be needing these
09:40 - guys for my store in order to integrate
09:42 - the moulton libraries into our Xcode
09:45 - project so you'll see that in the next
09:46 - lesson I hope you guys are setting up
09:48 - your own store to follow along and in
09:51 - the next lesson we're going to set up
09:52 - our Xcode project so I'll see you there
09:54 - bye for now
09:57 - you

hate coders happy Tuesday Chris here with part two of our shopping app series in the previous video I gave you a tour of molten overview of the features and the dashboard well today we're going to get
