00:00 - hey guys what's up it's Chris here and
00:02 - in today's video I wanted to show you a
00:05 - video I recorded for a student in my
00:07 - course uh where I helped him
00:09 - troubleshoot his xcode project because
00:11 - he had a crash I want to show you this
00:13 - for two reasons um in case you are a
00:15 - beginner uh watching my channel uh the
00:18 - mistakes that he made in this project
00:20 - are very common for beginners so I think
00:22 - that will help you if you're just
00:24 - starting to build apps yourself and
00:26 - second of all um it illustrates the
00:30 - thought process I go through when I
00:32 - encounter a crash in the in the app and
00:35 - kind of what steps I take to try and
00:36 - find out what's wrong so that will be
00:38 - very helpful if you're just starting to
00:40 - get the hang of debugging before I show
00:42 - you that video though there's two things
00:44 - I want to mention first are these learn
00:47 - Swift challenges uh I think there were
00:51 - it was a couple of videos ago when I
00:52 - introduced them so if you haven't tried
00:54 - them yet please do so because it's going
00:56 - to really reveal what you don't
00:59 - understand and what you forgot frankly
01:02 - so try out these challenges even if you
01:04 - cannot complete them because it will
01:06 - tell you what you don't know and um I
01:09 - will be posting solutions for them very
01:11 - shortly this week and second of all if
01:13 - you have completed them please be sure
01:16 - to come on this page and click to tweet
01:18 - let me know and I will add your name
01:21 - here there's still a couple of names I
01:22 - haven't added yet but I'll do so soon
01:25 - and the second thing is that um I have
01:28 - been busy
01:30 - um grabbing all of the success stories
01:32 - and putting them on one page here and
01:35 - there are more but I've I need to take a
01:39 - break from doing this so this is not all
01:41 - of them but anyways I feel like this is
01:43 - useful because you can you can click on
01:45 - an icon and then you can go to that
01:49 - story where it illustrates um there's a
01:53 - little tiny interview with the
01:55 - developer and it tells you what their
01:57 - Lessons Learned were and kind of what
01:59 - their struggles were and if you're
02:02 - building your app for the first time um
02:05 - this may be helpful for you as well all
02:07 - of these people who built and published
02:09 - these apps were beginners to the iOS
02:11 - platform who had built apps before now
02:15 - if you've followed my videos or you've
02:17 - learned from my videos or my articles
02:20 - and you've built an app I'd love to hear
02:21 - about it please uh send me a message can
02:24 - be an email and let's get your app
02:26 - featured on this page as well okay so
02:28 - with those two things out of the way
02:30 - let's get down to the debugging video I
02:32 - hope you guys enjoy
02:34 - it hey Jacob it's Chris here I thought
02:36 - it'd be easier to show you what was
02:38 - going on with your project um in a video
02:41 - so I'm just going to build your project
02:43 - here and I took a look at the error
02:45 - message beforehand um it does say build
02:48 - succeed now but uh let me run the
02:52 - project and in running the
02:56 - project you get a
02:58 - crash right this itself doesn't tell you
03:01 - very much so usually what um what will
03:06 - give you an indication of what the error
03:08 - is is if you go down in this console
03:10 - area this debug console area and you
03:12 - scroll all the way to the top because
03:14 - what happens is the error happens and
03:17 - then there's some it gives you what the
03:19 - error message is here like a friendly
03:21 - one and then it dumps out all of this
03:24 - what's called a stack trace and um it
03:27 - has all of these memory addresses and
03:28 - kind of like low stuff which um is kind
03:32 - of not that useful you know and so you
03:36 - scroll to the top and you learn to
03:39 - recognize what the errors are so for
03:40 - this specific one here um the set value
03:44 - for undefined key this class is not key
03:47 - value coding compliant for the key
03:49 - fourth stack View and I can see the typo
03:52 - here and this error is probably the most
03:55 - common error that you'll find um among
03:59 - people who just starting to learn um so
04:02 - this happens a lot for the students in
04:03 - the courses and it's actually a very
04:05 - easy fix so what the problem is um it's
04:09 - when you connect something from your
04:12 - storyboard to your from the storyboard
04:16 - to the code file to the view controller
04:18 - I mean and let's say you make a typo
04:21 - like you did here right so you probably
04:23 - deleted that
04:25 - property so I'm just trying to open
04:27 - things up here so um just to give you an
04:29 - example so you might have done something
04:31 - like this where you're looking at the
04:32 - fourth stack view here um you hold down
04:35 - control and then you know you drag a
04:37 - line over here on your uh view
04:39 - controller you let go and then you start
04:41 - typing in your outlet and then you you
04:43 - know type something you click connect
04:46 - and then you realize that oh no I made a
04:48 - typo so then what you do is you delete
04:51 - this outlet that was the typo and then
04:54 - you try and connect it
04:56 - again um and this time you type it
04:58 - incorrectly well the problem is is when
05:01 - you delete that typo IB Outlet um the
05:06 - connection from the element to that typo
05:09 - still exists so that's why it crashes
05:12 - because it's looking for you know fourth
05:15 - stack view with an H instead of a k and
05:17 - it can't find it cuz you you know
05:20 - obviously you've corrected it here and
05:23 - this is your you know final Outlet so if
05:25 - I go ahead go into this document outline
05:28 - right here and I rightclick on this
05:29 - stack view I'm actually going to see
05:31 - that this element is connected not only
05:33 - to this fourth stack view Outlet it's
05:36 - also going to be connected to this typo
05:39 - outlet that no longer exists and it's
05:42 - also going to be connected to the one
05:44 - that I just made up and deleted so all
05:48 - we have to do is right click that
05:49 - element you can see here it's connected
05:51 - to um fourth stack view this is the
05:54 - correct one this is the type of one and
05:57 - this is that random jumble of letters
05:59 - that I typed see it's connected to all
06:00 - three so when you run your app it's
06:02 - going to look for these connections
06:04 - which don't exist cuz we deleted those
06:06 - Outlets here so all you have to do is
06:08 - click this X on the one that doesn't
06:10 - exist anymore and leave the one that
06:12 - does exist right and after that running
06:16 - your project will be fine so that error
06:18 - that specific error is one that you're
06:20 - going to learn to recognize and the next
06:22 - time you see that message um you're
06:24 - going to you're going to recognize what
06:27 - it is okay so there's another crash one
06:29 - that I I haven't seen yet because I
06:32 - didn't actually let's see
06:35 - here uh constraint items must be an
06:38 - instance of UI view or UI layout guide
06:44 - so constraint items okay so this tells
06:47 - me that we are trying to create an NS
06:50 - layout constraint object and when we're
06:52 - trying to relate two items together into
06:55 - a constraint they must both be you know
06:58 - um
07:00 - a child eventually of uiv like they must
07:02 - be things that are shown in the
07:04 - storyboard so let's go ahead and try to
07:06 - find out where this is because it
07:08 - highlights this line again which isn't
07:10 - very
07:11 - useful so let's go into our code and
07:15 - we're going to double check everywhere
07:17 - where we uh create NS layout constraints
07:19 - so one very useful tip here I'm going to
07:22 - just copy NS layout constraint I'm going
07:25 - to hold down uh command shift and press
07:28 - F and I'm going to paste that there and
07:31 - what this is going to do it's going to
07:32 - search our entire project that's all the
07:34 - files in the project for NS layout
07:37 - constraint so you know I got this list
07:39 - here and I can just check every one of
07:41 - them so let's go and card first so here
07:45 - we are relating the card image
07:48 - view height is equal to nil not an
07:52 - attrib but that's fine image view we're
07:54 - setting the width okay that's fine top
07:58 - constraint the image view related to
08:01 - self so self is a type of a card it's a
08:05 - UI view that's fine they're both views
08:07 - right image view self that's fine okay
08:10 - so it must be these last two ones then
08:13 - let's see here nil not an
08:16 - attribute and it's layout
08:19 - card oh this this is the one that's
08:22 - wrong here you see height constraint
08:25 - you're relating card index but card
08:28 - index
08:30 - is this guy right here it's just an INT
08:32 - right so I think you actually meant to
08:34 - write card in there not card
08:37 - index so you can see how just scrolling
08:40 - up here and just reading this message
08:42 - gives you some indication of what's
08:45 - wrong and the more you see these and the
08:48 - more you you know find out the problem
08:50 - that was causing this message uh the
08:52 - more you're going to begin to recognize
08:54 - what these error messages tell you and
08:57 - the next time you see this one you kind
08:58 - of immediately have an idea of what to
09:00 - look for in your project okay so now
09:03 - let's run it again hopefully this is
09:06 - yeah build succeeded but let's hope it
09:11 - runs okay so I mean it it doesn't look
09:15 - like what it's supposed to I wonder why
09:19 - it's yeah there we go I guess we just
09:22 - didn't set it to landscape for this
09:23 - project yet but you get your cards and
09:25 - you get scrolling and I guess you
09:27 - haven't set the background yet but
09:29 - yeah now your project runs and I think
09:32 - that was a good exercise and I hope you
09:34 - learn something new so thanks for
09:35 - learning with me and I hope this helps
09:37 - bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up it's Chris here and in today's video I wanted to show you a video I recorded for a student in my course uh where I helped him troubleshoot his xcode project because he had a crash I want to show you this for two reasons um in case you are a beginner uh watching my channel uh the mistakes that he made in this project are very common for beginners so I think that will help you if you're just starting to build apps yourself and second of all um it illustrates the thought process I go through when I encounter a crash in the in the app and kind of what steps I take to try and find out what's wrong so that will be very helpful if you're just starting to get the hang of debugging before I show you that video though there's two things I want to mention first are these learn Swift challenges uh I think there were it was a couple of videos ago when I introduced them so if you haven't tried them yet please do so because it's going to really reveal what you don't understand and what you forgot frankly so try out these challenges even if you cannot complete them because it will tell you what you don't know and um I will be posting solutions for them very shortly this week and second of all if you have completed them please be sure to come on this page and click to tweet let me know and I will add your name here there's still a couple of names I haven't added yet but I'll do so soon and the second thing is that um I have been busy um grabbing all of the success stories and putting them on one page here and there are more but I've I need to take a break from doing this so this is not all of them but anyways I feel like this is useful because you can you can click on an icon and then you can go to that story where it illustrates um there's a little tiny interview with the developer and it tells you what their Lessons Learned were and kind of what their struggles were and if you're building your app for the first time um this may be helpful for you as well all of these people who built and published these apps were beginners to the iOS platform who had built apps before now if you've followed my videos or you've learned from my videos or my articles and you've built an app I'd love to hear about it please uh send me a message can be an email and let's get your app featured on this page as well okay so with those two things out of the way let's get down to the debugging video I hope you guys enjoy it hey Jacob it's Chris here I thought it'd be easier to show you what was going on with your project um in a video so I'm just going to build your project here and I took a look at the error message beforehand um it does say build succeed now but uh let me run the project and in running the project you get a crash right this itself doesn't tell you very much so usually what um what will give you an indication of what the error is is if you go down in this console area this debug console area and you scroll all the way to the top because what happens is the error happens and then there's some it gives you what the error message is here like a friendly one and then it dumps out all of this what's called a stack trace and um it has all of these memory addresses and kind of like low stuff which um is kind of not that useful you know and so you scroll to the top and you learn to recognize what the errors are so for this
