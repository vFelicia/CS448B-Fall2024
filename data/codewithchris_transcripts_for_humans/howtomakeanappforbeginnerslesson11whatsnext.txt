00:00 - hi you made it in this video I'm gonna
00:01 - tell you what to learn next now give you
00:03 - three pieces of advice on how to
00:05 - approach building your own app but first
00:07 - I want to mention that the 10 videos you
00:09 - just watched are actually part of my
00:10 - larger course that teaches beginners how
00:12 - to make apps there are over 50
00:14 - additional lessons that are going to
00:16 - continue growing your skills from here
00:18 - if you'd like to check that out just
00:20 - follow the URL on screen or in the
00:22 - description below alright now let's talk
00:24 - about building your own app I see this
00:25 - happen all the time
00:27 - one of two things actually problem
00:29 - number one you want to start building
00:30 - your own app but when you sit down to do
00:32 - it you have no idea where or how to
00:34 - start and problem number two you have
00:37 - all these great features imagine for
00:38 - your app you might even have wireframe
00:40 - the screens for your app already it's
00:43 - going to have multiple screens login and
00:45 - user accounts it's going to have social
00:46 - features it's going to connect to a
00:48 - database connect a Facebook Twitter
00:50 - Instagram it's going to have forms for
00:53 - the user to fill out you know the whole
00:54 - works and then you start working on your
00:57 - first feature and you encounter a
00:58 - roadblock after wrestling with it for a
01:00 - few hours you begin to realize that it's
01:02 - going to take a lot more time and work
01:04 - than you thought you get overwhelmed
01:06 - wonder if it's all worth it and then you
01:08 - abandon the project look I'm sorry for
01:11 - painting such an ugly picture but the
01:13 - good news is that I'm gonna tell you
01:14 - exactly how to overcome those two
01:16 - problems right now let's address problem
01:18 - number one whenever I start a brand new
01:21 - app I always think about the previous
01:23 - projects that I've built before this
01:25 - gives me a great starting point I might
01:27 - realize that the structure for this app
01:28 - I'm trying to build is very similar or
01:30 - slightly similar to an app that I've
01:33 - already built before either way it gives
01:35 - me a starting point to build off of if
01:37 - you don't have the experience of past
01:39 - projects to draw from it's hard to know
01:41 - how to start your own app so this brings
01:43 - me to my first piece of advice when
01:45 - you're first starting out build as many
01:47 - small projects or demos as you can get
01:49 - your hands on there are tons of
01:50 - tutorials out there and even on my
01:52 - youtube channel where you're going to
01:54 - build small demos or small apps it
01:55 - doesn't matter if that demo or small app
01:58 - has nothing to do with your dream app
02:00 - the point is you want to build up that
02:02 - pool of experience so that when it comes
02:04 - time to building your own app you have
02:05 - that experience to draw from in my
02:08 - course you'll be building for real apps
02:10 - that you can actually submit to the App
02:11 - Store
02:12 - made each have very different so that by
02:14 - completing them you have a well-rounded
02:16 - pool of experience that you can draw
02:18 - from for your own app now let's talk
02:20 - about problem number two when you start
02:22 - building your own app you make the
02:24 - mistake of trying to boil the ocean have
02:26 - you heard of that phrase before
02:27 - how about biting off more than you can
02:29 - chew the point is great apps don't
02:32 - usually get built all at once when I
02:34 - start a new app and they're features
02:36 - that I've never worked on before I
02:37 - usually break out those features into
02:39 - smaller test projects get them working
02:41 - in the smaller projects first and then
02:43 - go back to the main project so that is
02:45 - my second piece of advice for you forget
02:47 - the bigger picture for now and focus on
02:49 - working on each feature in your smaller
02:51 - project this way you're going to get a
02:53 - sense of accomplishment each time you
02:55 - get a feature done rather than getting
02:57 - overwhelmed with the larger scope of the
02:59 - project when you build the four apps in
03:01 - my course you'll be taking this approach
03:02 - oftentimes we'll try out a new feature
03:05 - in a playground or in a smaller project
03:07 - before working on the main project
03:09 - you'll also learn how I plan out the app
03:11 - architecture for my app before starting
03:13 - the code you'll save yourself a lot of
03:15 - headache and time by learning how to
03:17 - navigate through potential pitfalls
03:19 - before you start to code my third piece
03:21 - of advice for you is that learning is a
03:23 - very human process instead of just
03:25 - learning by yourself in a vacuum try to
03:27 - find some communities or forums either
03:30 - online or offline and immerse yourself
03:32 - having that support system goes a long
03:34 - ways towards increasing your chances of
03:37 - success so in order to provide that
03:38 - human element in my own courses I decide
03:41 - to give students access to myself one of
03:43 - the biggest reasons that people join my
03:45 - course is so that they can get my
03:47 - guidance as they're learning iOS I
03:49 - personally answer all my questions and
03:51 - help students over the hump with a
03:53 - specific problem that they are facing
03:55 - oftentimes recording videos just to
03:57 - explain something to them you'll also
03:59 - get access to a private Facebook group
04:01 - only for members of the course where you
04:03 - can form relationships get help or just
04:06 - bounce ideas off of like-minded
04:07 - individuals who are also learning iOS
04:10 - again the link to my course is on screen
04:12 - or in the description below
04:13 - alright let's recap my three pieces of
04:16 - advice for you number one build as many
04:18 - small demos and projects as you can to
04:20 - experience under your belt number two
04:22 - break out the functionality of your app
04:24 - into smaller projects number three find
04:27 - a support system for learning iOS
04:29 - finally I want to thank you so much for
04:31 - learning with me whether that's through
04:32 - my courses my YouTube channel or my blog
04:35 - thank you for your support
04:37 - I really appreciate it and if there's
04:39 - anything I can do to help just leave me
04:41 - a comment below thank you for watching
