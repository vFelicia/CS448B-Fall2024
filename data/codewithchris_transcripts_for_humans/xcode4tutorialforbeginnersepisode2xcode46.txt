00:08 - hey guys welcome back this is episode
00:10 - two of my xcode tutorial Series so last
00:15 - episode we just introduced where to
00:17 - download xcode and how to get it on your
00:19 - system and today we're actually going to
00:20 - be looking at the user interface and
00:23 - describing all of the different areas so
00:25 - let's get
00:26 - started so I created this graphic for
00:29 - you guys to illust illustrate what the
00:30 - different areas of xcode are as you can
00:33 - see the big colored blocks represent the
00:35 - main areas of xcode and we're going to
00:37 - start with the one on the left the
00:39 - Navigator area uh you could probably
00:42 - guess that you look through your project
00:44 - files here but you can also look through
00:46 - things like breakpoints and issues and
00:48 - stuff so we'll go through that um to the
00:50 - right of that there's the editor area
00:53 - and this is where you write your code
00:54 - mainly and there's some special features
00:57 - of this area such as intellisense and
01:00 - you know jumping around within your code
01:02 - making it easy for you to write your
01:03 - code I'll go through all of that stuff
01:06 - and then there's the debug area below
01:08 - that that's where you're going to be
01:10 - able to um when you breakpoint your code
01:13 - or or when it crashes you're going to be
01:15 - able to get more information to figure
01:17 - out why that's happening on the right
01:19 - hand side the utility area it's made up
01:22 - of two panes the first is the inspector
01:24 - pain and that gives you more attributes
01:27 - for either the I element that you're
01:30 - looking at or if you're looking at a
01:32 - file it'll give you attributes for the
01:35 - file below that there's the library
01:38 - where you can store code Snippets or you
01:41 - can also drag UI elements onto um your
01:45 - you know we using it with interface
01:47 - Builder and then there's the toolbar at
01:49 - the top so I quickly want to show you
01:52 - guys how to customize their interface
01:55 - depending on your own situation there
01:57 - are three buttons up here in the upper
01:59 - right hand corner under this View group
02:02 - and if you click any of them they just
02:04 - toggle the big panes that we talked
02:06 - about and this is useful for example if
02:10 - you're on a small Monitor and you you
02:13 - know you're really cramped and something
02:16 - like this you could definitely hide that
02:18 - right pan you wouldn't need it and you
02:20 - can even hide this debug pane if you're
02:22 - just coding and you're not running your
02:24 - app and actually debugging uh so you can
02:29 - this can come in handy some of the time
02:32 - that served as a primer to the major
02:34 - areas of the xcode interface and in the
02:37 - next video we're going to Deep dive into
02:39 - the Navigator area and now for our fun
02:41 - fact of the day did you know that until
02:44 - June of 2010 Apple still referred to the
02:47 - iPhone operating system as the iPhone OS
02:51 - now I don't know about you guys but if I
02:54 - say the letters iOS to people most
02:57 - people won't even know what I'm talking
02:58 - about who are non developers what has
03:01 - your experience been have you ever
03:02 - mentioned iOS to someone and did they
03:04 - get it let me know in the comment
03:06 - section below
