00:05 - hello welcome to lesson six of the
00:07 - Firebase tutorial video series in the
00:10 - previous lesson we were looking at how
00:12 - this database stores its data and the
00:16 - data that we created here was just uh
00:18 - some sample data to illustrate um how
00:21 - data is stored so I'm just going to go
00:23 - ahead and delete these
00:25 - nodes so that it doesn't because it's
00:28 - not going to be working with our
00:29 - messaging app
00:31 - all right now the database is clear and
00:33 - we're going to jump back into xcode and
00:35 - open up our messaging app
00:39 - here and where we're going to implement
00:42 - that code is actually in in terms of
00:45 - saving data is in the compose view
00:48 - controller uh in the add Post in fact
00:51 - you can see that we put a little to-do
00:53 - here post the data to Firebase and what
00:56 - we're going to want to do is go into the
00:59 - document M ation I would advise that you
01:01 - keep this handy um as you're you're
01:04 - building your Firebase app because uh
01:07 - the guides contain a lot of helpful
01:09 - information sometimes as you're just
01:11 - getting started the syntax is hard to
01:13 - remember uh just click get started
01:17 - guide and scroll here to realtime
01:23 - database under iOS you can click on here
01:27 - read and write data
01:30 - so it tells us that the first thing we
01:32 - have to do here is create a reference to
01:35 - uh the database and this is going to
01:38 - pull from the config file which we've
01:40 - added this Google service- info.plist so
01:44 - up here let's first
01:48 - import Firebase database like that and
01:51 - then what we're going to do is VAR uh
01:55 - reference and this is going to be a fi
01:59 - or fire base database
02:03 - reference and I'm going to make it an
02:06 - optional type because I'm not going to
02:07 - declare it right here we're going to
02:10 - initialize it in here in the viewed load
02:13 - so it's ref I'm going to now assign
02:17 - something into it before this just
02:19 - creating the property called ref so ref
02:23 - equals
02:25 - database. database.
02:28 - reference let's go back here and that's
02:32 - what we just did here so now we're ready
02:35 - to use uh we're ready to use the
02:38 - database through this ref
02:43 - property okay so let's talk
02:46 - about how we can write our data here so
02:49 - in order to write data we need to know
02:52 - where we want to write that data and how
02:55 - we do that is we call this child method
02:58 - we specify the node node or the branch
03:00 - we want to travel down so for example um
03:03 - I wish I didn't delete all the data just
03:06 - yet so let's just say if we had that
03:09 - customers's node and then we had another
03:11 - node like customer one and the value was
03:15 - I think it was we had name Harry like
03:19 - that and I wanted to write another key
03:22 - value pair under customer one uh I would
03:25 - have to go customers right child
03:28 - customers and then child customer one to
03:30 - get to this point and then I would set a
03:32 - new key value pair down there so you can
03:35 - see some of that going on here you can
03:37 - see thatt child and then it goes users
03:40 - right and then down another Branch or
03:43 - another node below that is uh Child
03:47 - user. ID and finally they would use the
03:50 - set value to set that key value pair and
03:53 - you can use the this child chaining for
03:57 - as many levels deep as you want it to go
03:59 - but for we're just going to have one
04:02 - level called posts so for example if I
04:06 - had you know posts like that oh I don't
04:11 - think I can add it like that but in here
04:13 - in viewed load if I want to add the post
04:17 - I would say
04:18 - ref. child and I would create the path
04:22 - posts like that uh and because there is
04:25 - no posts node right here uh it's just
04:29 - going to create it and then underneath
04:31 - posts we would want to create a key
04:35 - value pair so what we're going to do
04:38 - because I don't really care about what
04:40 - the the key is or the name is we're
04:42 - going to use this child by Auto ID it's
04:45 - going to automatically create an ID for
04:47 - our post and then finally I can use set
04:50 - value and I'm just going to set
04:54 - a hardcoded string right now so you can
04:56 - see what that looks like uh so let me
04:58 - run this now
05:00 - and when we click on the add post button
05:03 - it's going to uh set this data okay it's
05:07 - going to go down the path posts and it's
05:10 - going to create a new ID and then the
05:13 - value for that ID is going to be hello
05:16 - Firebase so before we're going to write
05:19 - this data into the database there's
05:20 - actually one thing that we have to do
05:23 - and that is to go into our database
05:26 - rules because by default uh we need
05:30 - to be authenticated before we can read
05:33 - or write but actually we can change this
05:36 - so that right now for demonstration
05:38 - purposes um anybody can do so um before
05:41 - I change that let me go here in the
05:45 - documentation under
05:47 - authentication uh let's say manage
05:50 - users was it here no it is under
05:56 - database get started I think oh security
05:59 - rules right
06:04 - here get
06:06 - started okay so here is by default uh
06:10 - what the rules for the database are um
06:12 - you need to be authenticated to read or
06:14 - write in order to change it to public
06:17 - all you have to do is specify true for
06:19 - read and true for write so let's do that
06:23 - for our database right here and again
06:26 - you get here by clicking database and
06:28 - then rules here and let's change
06:33 - this
06:35 - true and
06:37 - true now let's publish this and it tells
06:40 - you that you've defined it as anybody
06:43 - can read or write so that's what we're
06:45 - going to want for our app here let's
06:48 - launch
06:54 - it and this data here it's sample data
06:58 - this is not from our database we
06:59 - hardcoded this data to demonstrate that
07:01 - the table view works when we finally
07:04 - retrieve the data from our database we
07:06 - can get rid of these messages okay so
07:09 - let's click on compose and when I click
07:11 - on this add post button uh we're going
07:14 - to see it pop here into our database
07:19 - hopefully okay so did you see that I
07:22 - clicked the button and instantly it
07:24 - created a posts node and there's our
07:28 - Auto ID
07:30 - and here is uh the value for that and
07:34 - because the Auto ID is just random if I
07:37 - do it again right it's going to create
07:40 - another post like that so what we're
07:42 - going to do here is just delete this
07:44 - customers node because that was just
07:46 - sample
07:48 - data and we are going to go back into
07:52 - our app right now and instead of hello
07:55 - Firebase we're going to set it to uh the
07:59 - text
08:01 - view. text and this time let's run it
08:04 - again now we can add some text into
08:07 - it and post it to
08:13 - Firebase so let's
08:16 - say hello from
08:20 - YouTube click add post and here you can
08:24 - see that data reflected in our database
08:26 - in the next lesson you're going to learn
08:28 - how to retrieve this data and how we're
08:30 - going to display it in our table view
08:33 - thanks for watching and I'll see you in
08:35 - the next lesson bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to lesson six of the Firebase tutorial video series in the previous lesson we were looking at how this database stores its data and the data that we created here was just uh some sample data to illustrate um how data is stored so I'm just going to go ahead and delete these nodes so that it doesn't because it's not going to be working with our messaging app all right now the database is clear and we're going to jump back into xcode and open up our messaging app here and where we're going to implement that code is actually in in terms of saving data is in the compose view controller uh in the add Post in fact you can see that we put a little todo here post the data to Firebase and what we're going to want to do is go into the document M ation I would advise that you keep this handy um as you're you're building your Firebase app because uh the guides contain a lot of helpful information sometimes as you're just getting started the syntax is hard to remember uh just click get started guide and scroll here to realtime database under iOS you can click on here read and write data so it tells us that the first thing we have to do here is create a reference to uh the database and this is going to pull from the config file which we've added this Google service info.plist so up here let's first import Firebase database like that and then what we're going to do is VAR uh reference and this is going to be a fi or fire base database reference and I'm going to make it an optional type because I'm not going to declare it right here we're going to initialize it in here in the viewed load so it's ref I'm going to now assign something into it before this just creating the property called ref so ref equals database. database. reference let's go back here and that's what we just did here so now we're ready to use uh we're ready to use the database through this ref property okay so let's talk about how we can write our data here so in order to write data we need to know where we want to write that data and how we do that is we call this child method we specify the node node or the branch we want to travel down so for example um I wish I didn't delete all the data just yet so let's just say if we had that customers's node and then we had another node like customer one and the value was I think it was we had name Harry like that and I wanted to write another key value pair under customer one uh I would have to go customers right child customers and then child customer one to get to this point and then I would set a new key value pair down there so you can see some of that going on here you can see thatt child and then it goes users right and then down another Branch or another node below that is uh Child user. ID and finally they would use the set value to set that key value pair and you can use the this child chaining for as many levels deep as you want it to go but for we're just going to have one level called posts so for example if I had you know posts like that oh I don't think I can add it like that but in here in viewed load if I want to add the post I would say ref. child and I would create the path posts like that uh and because there is no posts node right here uh it's just going to create it and then underneath posts we would want to create a key value pair so what we're going to do because I don't really care about what the the key is or the name is we're going to use this child by Auto ID it's going to automatically create an ID for our post and then finally I can use set value and I'm just going to set a hardcoded string right now so you can see what that looks like uh so let me run this now and when we click on the add post button it's going to uh set this data okay it's going to go down the path posts and it's going to create a new ID and then the value for that ID is going to be hello Firebase so before we're going to write this data into the database there's actually one thing that we have to do and that is to go into our database rules because by default uh we need to be authenticated before we can read or write but actually we can change this so that right now for demonstration purposes um anybody can do so um before I change that let me go here in the documentation under authentication uh let's say manage users was it here no it is under database get started I think oh security rules right here get started okay so here is by default uh what the rules for the database are um you need to be authenticated to read or write in order to change it to public all you have to do is specify true for read and true for write so let's do that for our database right here and again you get here by clicking database and then rules here and let's change this true and true now let's publish this and it tells you that you've defined it as anybody can read or write so that's what we're going to want for our app here let's launch it and this data here it's sample data this is not from our database we hardcoded this data to demonstrate that the table view works when we finally retrieve the data from our database we can get rid of these messages okay so let's click on compose and when I click on this add post button uh we're going to see it pop here into our database hopefully okay so did you see that I clicked the button and instantly it created a posts node and there's our Auto ID and here is uh the value for that and because the Auto ID is just random if I do it again right it's going to create another post like that so what we're going to do here is just delete this customers node because that was just sample data and we are going to go back into our app right now and instead of hello Firebase we're going to set it to uh the text view. text and this time let's run it again now we can add some text into it and post it to Firebase so let's say hello from YouTube click add post and here you can see that data reflected in our database in the next lesson you're going to learn how to retrieve this data and how we're going to display it in our table view thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next lesson bye for now
