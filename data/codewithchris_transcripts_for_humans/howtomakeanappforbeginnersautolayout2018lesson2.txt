00:00 - hi welcome to lesson two in this video
00:02 - you're going to learn how to build your
00:03 - apps user interface and that's just the
00:05 - technical term for the screen that the
00:07 - user sees you'll learn about Auto layout
00:09 - that's used to position and size
00:10 - elements by the end of this video you'll
00:13 - have built this user interface as you
00:16 - can see you're going to learn how to add
00:17 - images text and how to position them
00:20 - more importantly you're going to be
00:21 - doing it with Auto layout constraints
00:23 - and you're going to learn how to do it
00:24 - in a way that's going to make it work
00:26 - for all screen sizes so we're just going
00:29 - to start a brand new Xcode project just
00:31 - like we did in the previous lesson make
00:34 - sure you're looking under this iOS tab
00:35 - and that you've got single View app
00:37 - selected let's click Next and then in
00:41 - the product name I'm going to say app
00:43 - two and the rest of the properties
00:46 - should already be filled out from the
00:48 - project you created from the last lesson
00:50 - we don't need to change any of that
00:51 - let's click Next and then we are just
00:54 - going to save it on the desktop we're
00:57 - going to jump right into the main dot
00:59 - storyboard here because we're going to
01:01 - start customizing our view in the lower
01:04 - right hand corner do you remember that
01:06 - what this is called this is the library
01:07 - pane and we're going to be looking at
01:10 - this tab the object library this is
01:12 - where we are going to be able to select
01:15 - some elements to add into our view so in
01:17 - this filter text box I'm going to type
01:19 - in image view because this is the
01:21 - element we're going to use to display
01:22 - images in our screen so let's click and
01:26 - drag and then drop that into our view
01:28 - unfortunately right now we don't have
01:31 - any images to show in that image view we
01:35 - have to actually add those images into
01:37 - our Xcode project so if you look in the
01:40 - file navigator here on the left hand
01:42 - side right underneath the main that
01:44 - storyboard you'll see this assets
01:46 - thought EXCI assets if you click that
01:48 - it's going to bring you to a section
01:51 - where we store the images that we use
01:53 - for our project as expected there's
01:55 - nothing right here and in fact there's
01:57 - even an entry for the app icon but there
02:00 - are no image assets here so what we're
02:03 - going to want to do is add some images
02:04 - in here for us to use and if you check
02:07 - the description below this video I've
02:09 - got a link to the image that we're going
02:11 - to use in this project it's called
02:13 - less than two assets dot zip so just
02:16 - click that link right now download that
02:18 - zip file and put it on your desktop and
02:21 - then I want you to go ahead and unzip
02:25 - that file I'm going to double click the
02:28 - zip file and it's going to unpack it and
02:30 - out pops an image this is the image
02:33 - we're going to use so all you have to do
02:35 - is click this image and drag it into
02:37 - your Xcode project and you should have
02:40 - highlighted the asset sexy assets so you
02:43 - can drag it directly into this asset
02:45 - library you can either put it in this
02:47 - panel or this panel it really doesn't
02:49 - matter but when you let go of your mouse
02:51 - button you're going to have this image
02:53 - in your Xcode project now what we're
02:55 - gonna want to do is actually rename this
02:57 - asset and I'm going to click it and wait
03:01 - about a second it's going to open up a
03:03 - text box for us to rename it put
03:06 - landscape in there alternatively you can
03:09 - actually highlight it and just hit enter
03:10 - on your keyboard and that allows you to
03:12 - rename it as well so right now you
03:15 - should be looking at your assets without
03:18 - EXCI assets you should have this
03:20 - landscape entry and you should see this
03:23 - image here let's go back to main
03:25 - storyboard and now in this image view
03:29 - just highlight it in the document
03:32 - outline and right here in the inspector
03:34 - pane we're looking at the attributes
03:37 - inspector at the very top there is this
03:40 - image property pull the drop down down
03:43 - and you're going to see that image asset
03:45 - which we added so just click that and
03:48 - then immediately you're going to see
03:50 - your image view display that image now
03:53 - we're going to want this guy to be full
03:55 - screen so we're going to need to set
03:57 - some constraints for this uiimageview
04:00 - but first I want to show you something
04:02 - called the safe area in this document
04:05 - outline if you go ahead and click that
04:07 - you're going to see a portion of your
04:09 - view highlighted in blue and this is
04:11 - what is known as the safe area you can
04:15 - see this little bar at the top in white
04:17 - that's not part of the safe area and the
04:20 - safe area is just a space where you can
04:23 - be guaranteed that the stuff you add
04:25 - won't be
04:26 - obstructed so as you can tell up here
04:29 - this is where the status bar for the
04:31 - phone is all right you see your time you
04:33 - see the carrier you see you know a bunch
04:36 - of icons and stuff like that so it's
04:39 - just warning you you know if you
04:40 - highlight the safe area that the area
04:42 - highlighted in blue is an area where
04:45 - your elements won't get obstructed now
04:48 - that doesn't mean that you can't put
04:50 - anything up here I mean we can go ahead
04:52 - and stretch that image all the way to
04:53 - the very top we just have to understand
04:55 - that there may be some text overlaying
04:57 - that like the carrier the time the
05:00 - symbols and such so this is going to
05:03 - come into play because when we add Auto
05:05 - layout constraints we can specify do we
05:08 - want that constraint like for instance
05:10 - if we're specifying a top margin for
05:12 - this element do we want that to be zero
05:15 - from the safe area or do we want it to
05:18 - be zero from the very edge of the screen
05:20 - all right so I'm going to show you that
05:21 - right now we're gonna highlight the
05:23 - uiimageview
05:24 - and then we're going to go down here to
05:26 - the bottom right and we're gonna click
05:29 - this add new constraints button and this
05:32 - menu pops up it's going to allow us to
05:33 - add some margin constraints for our
05:36 - uiimageview you can see four text boxes
05:38 - here one on each side and each of these
05:41 - text boxes represents the margin that we
05:43 - want to set for that uiimageview right
05:47 - here there are some default numbers and
05:48 - these numbers are just the current
05:50 - values if we wanted to have the UI image
05:54 - view look like this so you can see 2:35
05:57 - here right now this length right here is
06:00 - 2:35 so we're gonna go ahead and change
06:03 - this to zero oh and I should mention
06:06 - that the values you see here will be
06:08 - different because when you drag that
06:10 - uiimageview into the view you'll
06:12 - probably have dropped it in a different
06:14 - place than I have so where I dropped it
06:16 - into the view these are the current
06:18 - margins so I've set this to 1 to 0 you
06:20 - can see that this constraint is active
06:23 - or I'm about to add it because this red
06:26 - line is highlighted now the other three
06:29 - margin lines are blanked out and down
06:32 - here you can see add one constraint if I
06:34 - change the number it kind of
06:35 - automatically activates that constraint
06:39 - and you can see down here it says add to
06:41 - constraints now if I click this button
06:43 - right now it's going to add this top
06:45 - constraint and this left constraint now
06:48 - I can actually click that and turn it on
06:50 - or off right now I'm not adding any
06:52 - constraints and right now I'm adding two
06:54 - constraints another thing I want to
06:56 - mention is this little triangle here
06:58 - these aren't actually text boxes they're
07:01 - actually dropdowns so if I click this
07:03 - you're going to see the safe area and
07:06 - the view this is what I was mentioning
07:08 - before do we want it to be zero margin
07:11 - from the safe area or from the view so
07:14 - I'm actually gonna change this to the
07:16 - view like that and be careful because it
07:19 - changes back to 235 when I select that
07:21 - so I'm gonna go ahead and hit 0 again so
07:25 - even for these ones I'm going to change
07:26 - it from safe area to the view to make
07:28 - sure it's actually to the very edge of
07:30 - the screen this one again change it to
07:32 - the vo and this one down here I'm going
07:35 - to change it to the view and then I'm
07:36 - going to set all of these to zero so a
07:39 - fast way to jump through the different
07:40 - text boxes is if you just press tab like
07:44 - that and then lastly we're going to
07:46 - uncheck constrain 2 margins because we
07:49 - want it to be to the very edge and not
07:51 - toward some margin and then down here it
07:54 - should say add 4 constraints so click
07:56 - that and immediately you're gonna see
07:58 - that uiimageview stretch to all 4 edges
08:01 - now it doesn't go all the way to the top
08:04 - I'm gonna double check what we added
08:06 - there if you look in the document
08:08 - outline you'll see that now you have
08:09 - this entry called constraints if we
08:11 - expand that you can see the four
08:13 - constraints which we added and clicking
08:15 - each of them you can look in the
08:18 - inspector pane on the right hand side
08:20 - and you can look at some configurable
08:22 - properties for it so let's take a look
08:24 - at the top one landscape top equals so
08:27 - somehow even though I set it to the view
08:30 - somehow it's changed itself back to the
08:32 - safe area so what we can do actually
08:35 - before I do that let me explain to you
08:38 - what this means so this constraint is
08:41 - saying to make the landscape landscape
08:44 - is our image view right the top edge of
08:46 - our image view equal to the top edge of
08:49 - the safe area
08:51 - right and zero this is what we specified
08:54 - but I don't want it to be zero from the
08:56 - safe area I actually want it to be zero
08:58 - from the view up here so I'm gonna pull
09:01 - this drop down down and I'm going to
09:03 - choose super view and super view is just
09:06 - a term to describe the view that
09:07 - contains our UI image view so let's
09:10 - click on super view and then you can see
09:13 - that this constant has changed to 20 and
09:15 - you can see that there is this bar here
09:18 - this constraint is indicating that my UI
09:21 - image view is now 20 from the super view
09:24 - top well I'm going to change that back
09:26 - to zero
09:27 - hit enter and now you can see that it's
09:30 - actually zero from the very very top
09:33 - instead of the safe area so I've just
09:35 - showed you that you can click on a
09:38 - constraint and you can edit it from this
09:41 - inspector panel now I want to show you
09:43 - that you can actually just remove them
09:45 - so if you make a mistake
09:46 - go ahead into this document outline
09:48 - right here you can hold down command or
09:51 - shift and you can click each of them
09:53 - like this and then just go ahead and hit
09:56 - delete on your keyboard if we do that
09:58 - this image view it looks like it's
10:00 - positioned correctly but in reality
10:03 - there are no constraints dictating how
10:05 - it should be positioned or sized
10:07 - so that's going to be a problem we've
10:09 - just deleted all of our constraints as
10:11 - extra practice we're gonna just riad
10:13 - them so let's click on the landscape
10:17 - right here this UI image view that is
10:20 - now named landscape I mean and then go
10:22 - down here to the bottom right and go to
10:24 - add new constraints and we're gonna do
10:26 - this again so first of all it looks like
10:31 - this one is safe area so I'm going to
10:33 - choose view this one safe here I'm going
10:36 - to select view instead this one I'm
10:39 - gonna select view this one is view ok
10:42 - and it's double check that it hasn't
10:45 - changed on me again and let's click add
10:48 - for constraints so there we go we have
10:51 - four again all right the next thing is
10:53 - that this image actually looks kind of
10:56 - stretched and looks distorted right if
10:58 - we highlight the image view here and go
11:01 - into the inspector panel
11:04 - there is a property called content mode
11:06 - and this dictates how the image should
11:09 - be stretched or if it should not be
11:12 - stretched right now it's set to scale to
11:14 - fill which means it's just going to
11:16 - stretch it however it needs to in order
11:18 - to fill up the whole image view for
11:21 - instance we can set it to just center
11:23 - and it's just not going to stretch it
11:25 - and there's actually a lot of overlap
11:27 - that you can't see right now or we can
11:29 - set it to aspect fit it's just going to
11:32 - try and fit the entire image without
11:35 - stretching it or we can set it at the
11:38 - aspect Phil it's going to enlarge it so
11:41 - that it fills the entire image view but
11:43 - it's not going to distort it because
11:45 - it's going to maintain the same height
11:48 - and width ratio so that won't look
11:50 - squished or stretched or anything like
11:52 - that so that's the one we're going to
11:53 - choose so then we get something that
11:55 - looks like this alright now we have to
11:57 - add our labels but we can't just add our
11:59 - labels here because that text is going
12:02 - to be pretty hard to read so we're going
12:03 - to create a little bit of a black
12:05 - background here so that we can put our
12:08 - labels on top of it and then it'll be
12:10 - easier to read so down here in the
12:13 - object library let's change this filter
12:16 - text instead of image view let's type in
12:20 - UI view when you do that you're going to
12:23 - see this element here that says view so
12:26 - this is kind of like a generic view that
12:29 - we can color and we can put things in
12:31 - we're going to go ahead and click that
12:34 - and drag that onto our screen just like
12:37 - that and having it highlighted in this
12:40 - document outline I'm going to go over to
12:42 - the inspector pane we're gonna change
12:44 - the background color so go ahead hit
12:46 - this drop down and choose black color
12:48 - and then you're going to click this
12:50 - little black rectangle here that's going
12:53 - to bring up this little menu with a
12:54 - couple of tabs if you choose this tab
12:57 - here it's gonna be all blocked but you
12:59 - can slide this opacity and you can make
13:02 - it semi opaque like that and I'm going
13:06 - to set to about 80% you can also just
13:08 - type it into this text box here and then
13:10 - we're going to go ahead and click that
13:12 - red X to close it and you can see that
13:14 - we have this beautiful sort of
13:16 - semi-transparent
13:17 - black which we're going to put our
13:19 - labels on top of but first let's
13:21 - position this uiview so having it
13:25 - highlighted in our document outline I'm
13:27 - going to go over here and click add new
13:29 - constraints I'm going to just off the
13:32 - bat uncheck constrain to margins and I'm
13:35 - going to go ahead and enable the left
13:37 - the right and the bottom constraints and
13:40 - then I'm going to choose veal instead of
13:43 - safe area like that and change that and
13:47 - then I'm going to set these to zero
13:50 - notice that I'm not touching this top
13:52 - constraint and I'll show you why in a
13:53 - second I'm going to be zero there zero
13:56 - I'm gonna do zero let me just double
13:59 - check that it hasn't changed back to the
14:00 - safe area all right and we're gonna
14:05 - click add three constraints this time
14:06 - alright so you you're gonna see a couple
14:10 - of things here first of all it's stretch
14:12 - to the left and right because we added
14:14 - those constraints but now there's this
14:16 - red line here and it's supposed to stick
14:19 - to the bottom because we said it should
14:20 - be zero from the bottom but there's this
14:22 - red line here and over on the document
14:24 - outline you can see this little red
14:26 - arrow here if we click that you're going
14:28 - to see that there are some auto layout
14:31 - errors right here it says that it's
14:34 - missing some constraints it can't
14:36 - determine the Y position or the height
14:39 - so before our bottom constraint is going
14:43 - to take effect we're gonna need to set
14:45 - either a height for this view or a top
14:48 - constraint so that auto layout system
14:51 - has all the information it needs to be
14:53 - able to position that UI view so what
14:56 - we're going to do is highlight this view
14:58 - while holding down the command key click
15:00 - on this root view as well this is kind
15:03 - of like the the overall view that
15:05 - contains everything so okay let me try
15:07 - that again
15:08 - so highlight this view hold down command
15:10 - and then click this root view so you
15:12 - should have both of these highlighted in
15:14 - blue now and now with that I want to go
15:18 - down here add new constraints again and
15:20 - I want you to choose equal Heights and
15:23 - that is going to basically make this
15:26 - block dimmed view the same height as the
15:28 - root view which basically is this entire
15:31 - view right here but we're gonna do a
15:33 - little something special in order to
15:35 - make it dynamic so you're gonna see that
15:37 - in a second but for now make sure you
15:39 - have equal Heights checked on and then
15:42 - click add one constraint then you're
15:44 - gonna see basically the whole thing
15:47 - dimmed out and then a couple more
15:49 - constraints added in this constraints
15:52 - menu you can see that it's starting to
15:53 - get pretty confusing I can't really tell
15:56 - unless I really really try to read it I
15:58 - can't really tell which constraints have
16:01 - to do with the landscape and which
16:02 - constraints have to do with this view
16:04 - right so one easy way to tell if I only
16:08 - care about the constraints for this UI
16:10 - view for instance let's highlight it in
16:12 - the document outline here and then I'm
16:14 - going to go into the size inspector tab
16:17 - and if I scroll down it actually shows
16:20 - me that there are four constraints that
16:22 - relate to this element and like this I
16:25 - can easily tell which constraints that I
16:27 - want to modify so I actually want to
16:29 - modify this one equal height to super
16:32 - view I'm going to double click it well
16:35 - it's automatically going to highlight
16:37 - the constraint that I selected and then
16:39 - it's going to show me it's configurable
16:41 - properties here on the inspector pane so
16:44 - let me read this constraint to you the
16:46 - views height should be equal to the
16:48 - super views height so this is the view
16:51 - and this is the super view remember
16:53 - super view is just a fancy word for the
16:56 - view that contains that element so you
16:58 - can see that if I collapse this view
17:00 - everything is inside of it right so this
17:03 - view actually contains everything inside
17:05 - of it all right so if you have this
17:07 - reversed if you have super view dot
17:09 - height is equal to view dot height I
17:11 - want you to go down here and click on
17:13 - reverse first and second item if I click
17:15 - that you're gonna see super view height
17:18 - equal view height i don't want that i
17:20 - want you to click this reverse first and
17:22 - second item the first item should be
17:24 - view height because that's what you're
17:26 - trying to specify so our rule states
17:29 - that the views height should be equal to
17:31 - the super views height and down here
17:32 - there's a multiplier I want to change
17:34 - this to zero point three when I do that
17:38 - that's saying that the views height
17:41 - should be equal to zero point three
17:43 - times the soup
17:44 - views height and this is going to set
17:46 - the height so that it's about a third or
17:48 - about thirty percent of the entire
17:50 - height and this is going to be dynamic
17:52 - it doesn't matter how tall the root view
17:55 - is it's always going to be thirty
17:58 - percent of that height all right now in
18:00 - the bottom right hand corner let's
18:02 - change this UI view filter text let's
18:05 - type in label because we're about to add
18:07 - some labels and let's click and let's
18:11 - drag this into this block area this UI
18:14 - view when you do that you can see that
18:16 - my label is actually inside of this UI
18:20 - view now because this UI view is
18:22 - actually a container view it can contain
18:25 - other elements and now that my label is
18:28 - inside that view when I specify my auto
18:31 - layout constraints let's say I want it
18:32 - to be zero from the top it's going to be
18:35 - zero from the top of this UI view it's
18:39 - not going to be zero from the top of
18:40 - this route view right because you're
18:43 - always specifying the positioning
18:45 - constraints relative to the parent that
18:47 - contains it alright so since this view
18:50 - contains my label if I position my label
18:53 - zero from the top it's going to be based
18:56 - on the top of this view which is fine
18:58 - that's exactly what I want so let's
19:00 - highlight this label in the document
19:02 - outline let's go into the attributes
19:05 - inspector here
19:05 - first of all let's change the color so
19:07 - we can actually read it we're going to
19:09 - choose white color and let's change the
19:11 - label the city by the sea and don't
19:17 - worry that it's kind of cut off right
19:19 - now we're going to address that and then
19:21 - I'm going to click this little icon here
19:23 - so we can change it to a bold type of
19:26 - font and I'm just going to up the size
19:28 - to something like 24 and then we're
19:30 - going to specify some auto layout
19:31 - constraints for this guy so with this
19:34 - label highlighted I'm going to go down
19:36 - here to add constraints and we are going
19:40 - to let's do those constraints the top
19:45 - the left and the right so for the top
19:47 - I'm going to say 20 from the left I'm
19:50 - going to say 20 and from the right I'm
19:53 - going to say 20 as well and then we're
19:55 - going to click add three constraints and
19:57 - you're going to see something like this
19:59 - we're gonna add a little description
20:01 - label below that so let's click this
20:04 - label and let's pop it into there as
20:06 - well and now you can see in this
20:09 - document outline that my view contains
20:10 - two labels so highlight this second
20:14 - label let's configure some properties so
20:17 - let's change it to white let's change
20:18 - the font and we'll leave it at seventeen
20:20 - and we're gonna set some constraints for
20:23 - this guy so make sure it's highlighted
20:24 - here and then click on add new
20:27 - constraints down here and this time we
20:30 - are going to again we're going to do
20:33 - that but if you pull this drop down down
20:36 - you're going to see that you can
20:38 - position it relative to the label that's
20:40 - directly above it so we're going to
20:43 - choose that we're not going to choose
20:44 - the view so position it relative to the
20:47 - element that's right above it and I'm
20:49 - going to say that it should be ten
20:51 - points below that title label the left
20:55 - will be 20 and the right will be 20 as
20:59 - well and then I'm going to add these
21:01 - three constraints and they see something
21:03 - like that now I'm going to go back to
21:06 - these properties there are a couple
21:09 - things I forgot to set for example I
21:10 - want to type a sentence so this is such
21:14 - a beautiful place and if we wanted to
21:20 - make it multi-line all we have to do
21:22 - down here is change that lines by
21:26 - default it's 1 let's change it to 0 and
21:28 - if I typed more text it's going to be
21:30 - multi-line but I'm gonna leave it like
21:32 - that for now now that we've created this
21:34 - beautiful layout we're going to preview
21:37 - it in different screen sizes and
21:39 - orientations and the way we do that you
21:42 - might have noticed down here it says
21:44 - view as iPhone 8 if I click this I bring
21:48 - it up you can actually see a whole bunch
21:50 - of different screen sizes and
21:51 - orientations so the one I'm looking at
21:54 - right now is iPhone 8 but you can go up
21:57 - so let's say click this this is the
22:01 - iPhone X sometimes if you don't see this
22:05 - entire view or some if it's blocked out
22:08 - or maybe it's the screen is all white
22:09 - try zooming
22:11 - in and then zooming out to force that
22:13 - view to kind of refresh and redraw
22:15 - itself now let's go up again this is the
22:18 - iPhone 8 plus so you see here I have a
22:21 - white screen I'm just gonna click I'm
22:24 - gonna zoom in so you see now it's just
22:26 - redrawn if you don't have these controls
22:29 - here and maybe that you're maybe on a
22:31 - laptop screen and you can't see this you
22:34 - need to make a little more space click
22:36 - this document outline button to just
22:38 - hide the document outline and you'll
22:40 - probably get your zoom buttons down here
22:41 - all right so let's go downwards now so
22:44 - we were looking at the iPhone 8 that's
22:46 - where we started
22:47 - let's go downwards this is the iPhone se
22:49 - and this is the iPhone 4s now we're
22:52 - going to change the orientation we're
22:54 - going to click on landscape here as you
22:56 - can see that everything's adapted itself
22:59 - because all of our constraints are
23:02 - dynamic and you can see that this still
23:04 - takes up a 30% of the height of the
23:06 - screen we're going to go upwards this is
23:09 - the iPhone se iPhone 8 the iPhone 10 and
23:14 - again part of it is cropped
23:18 - let's go like that so you can see that
23:21 - here it's kind of a little bit almost
23:24 - touching our text label here now if we
23:28 - had specified that the left side of the
23:33 - UI image view and the UI view should be
23:36 - relative to the safe area and not to the
23:40 - very edge then we wouldn't have come
23:42 - into this notch area actually this part
23:44 - right here this part is considered a
23:45 - safe area let me see if I
23:48 - yeah if I click on safe area right here
23:50 - you can see a blue outline you can see
23:53 - that this left edge of the screen this
23:56 - is not in the safe area and you can see
23:59 - that this part is not in the safe area
24:02 - and also this part down here is not in
24:06 - the safe area since we kind of ignored
24:08 - the safe area and we specified our
24:10 - elements the very edges that's why this
24:13 - text is so closely here in order to fix
24:15 - this we might just increase the margin
24:17 - on the left side or something like that
24:20 - all right let's move on let's go to the
24:23 - next device we've got the A+
24:25 - this white screen let's zoom out zoom in
24:28 - so there you go
24:29 - now one thing I ought to mention is that
24:32 - this area down here lets you preview
24:35 - your layout in multiple screen sizes
24:38 - orientations but it also allows you to
24:41 - add constraints that are specific to a
24:44 - certain screen size and the way you do
24:46 - that is this button here very for
24:49 - constraints if you accidentally click
24:51 - this and then let's say you clicked
24:52 - something like that and then this area
24:55 - became blue then you're actually at this
24:59 - point you're going to be adding
25:00 - constraints that are specific to this
25:03 - right here and you're not actually
25:06 - specifying constraints to be specific to
25:08 - a screen size but there's something
25:11 - called size classes which each size
25:14 - class actually contains a bunch of
25:16 - different screen sizes it's like a
25:18 - category of screen sizes this is
25:21 - something that we'll cover down the line
25:22 - I want to warn you about it
25:24 - right now be just in case this area
25:27 - looks blue for you if it does you have
25:29 - to click on this done varying and
25:31 - chances are the constraints that you
25:33 - added were specific to whatever screen
25:37 - size you accidentally selected so I
25:39 - would at this point advise you after you
25:43 - you click on done varying if you had
25:46 - accidentally clicked it before is to now
25:49 - go ahead and delete all your constraints
25:51 - and kind of redo it and riad it but for
25:54 - most of you if you didn't click this
25:56 - button before and you didn't know about
25:58 - it or you didn't notice it and it's not
26:01 - blue chances are you don't have anything
26:03 - to worry about so now I'm gonna run it
26:05 - in the simulator so I'm gonna go ahead
26:07 - and select the iPhone 8 simulator
26:09 - I'm gonna click run I'm gonna see it
26:11 - launched in our simulator just like that
26:17 - and in order to rotate the device you
26:19 - can go up to hardware you can go down to
26:23 - rotate left or rotate right and as you
26:25 - can see there shortcut keys you can hold
26:27 - down command and press the left arrow or
26:29 - right arrow
26:31 - you can actually even just choose one
26:34 - like this from your orientation if I'm
26:36 - going to use the shortcut keys so on my
26:39 - keyboard
26:40 - let's press command and left you can see
26:42 - that it's just rotated rotate it back
26:45 - rotate it the other way now so there you
26:49 - have it today you learned about Auto
26:50 - layout and what the safe area is you
26:53 - learned how to add edit and delete
26:54 - constraints you also learn how to check
26:57 - your layout under different screen sizes
26:59 - and orientations now how would you like
27:01 - to get some extra practice and build
27:03 - another user interface I've got a
27:05 - worksheet for you to do just that go
27:08 - through it and build this user interface
27:10 - first I've got a question for you for
27:13 - the app that you want to build are you
27:15 - going to be focused on the iPad screen
27:17 - size or the iPhone screen size let me
27:20 - know by leaving a quick comment below if
27:23 - you liked this video please subscribe to
27:25 - my channel by clicking the subscribe
27:26 - button below and if you don't want to
27:28 - miss a single video make sure you click
27:29 - that Bell icon as well lastly don't
27:31 - forget to grab that worksheet and get
27:33 - some extra practice with Auto layout
27:35 - just follow the URL on the screen or
27:38 - click on the URL in the description
27:40 - below the video thanks for watching and
27:42 - I'll see you in the next lesson

Cleaned transcript:

hi welcome to lesson two in this video you're going to learn how to build your apps user interface and that's just the technical term for the screen that the user sees you'll learn about Auto layout that's used to position and size elements by the end of this video you'll have built this user interface as you can see you're going to learn how to add images text and how to position them more importantly you're going to be doing it with Auto layout constraints and you're going to learn how to do it in a way that's going to make it work for all screen sizes so we're just going to start a brand new Xcode project just like we did in the previous lesson make sure you're looking under this iOS tab and that you've got single View app selected let's click Next and then in the product name I'm going to say app two and the rest of the properties should already be filled out from the project you created from the last lesson we don't need to change any of that let's click Next and then we are just going to save it on the desktop we're going to jump right into the main dot storyboard here because we're going to start customizing our view in the lower right hand corner do you remember that what this is called this is the library pane and we're going to be looking at this tab the object library this is where we are going to be able to select some elements to add into our view so in this filter text box I'm going to type in image view because this is the element we're going to use to display images in our screen so let's click and drag and then drop that into our view unfortunately right now we don't have any images to show in that image view we have to actually add those images into our Xcode project so if you look in the file navigator here on the left hand side right underneath the main that storyboard you'll see this assets thought EXCI assets if you click that it's going to bring you to a section where we store the images that we use for our project as expected there's nothing right here and in fact there's even an entry for the app icon but there are no image assets here so what we're going to want to do is add some images in here for us to use and if you check the description below this video I've got a link to the image that we're going to use in this project it's called less than two assets dot zip so just click that link right now download that zip file and put it on your desktop and then I want you to go ahead and unzip that file I'm going to double click the zip file and it's going to unpack it and out pops an image this is the image we're going to use so all you have to do is click this image and drag it into your Xcode project and you should have highlighted the asset sexy assets so you can drag it directly into this asset library you can either put it in this panel or this panel it really doesn't matter but when you let go of your mouse button you're going to have this image in your Xcode project now what we're gonna want to do is actually rename this asset and I'm going to click it and wait about a second it's going to open up a text box for us to rename it put landscape in there alternatively you can actually highlight it and just hit enter on your keyboard and that allows you to rename it as well so right now you should be looking at your assets without EXCI assets you should have this landscape entry and you should see this image here let's go back to main storyboard and now in this image view just highlight it in the document outline and right here in the inspector pane we're looking at the attributes inspector at the very top there is this image property pull the drop down down and you're going to see that image asset which we added so just click that and then immediately you're going to see your image view display that image now we're going to want this guy to be full screen so we're going to need to set some constraints for this uiimageview but first I want to show you something called the safe area in this document outline if you go ahead and click that you're going to see a portion of your view highlighted in blue and this is what is known as the safe area you can see this little bar at the top in white that's not part of the safe area and the safe area is just a space where you can be guaranteed that the stuff you add won't be obstructed so as you can tell up here this is where the status bar for the phone is all right you see your time you see the carrier you see you know a bunch of icons and stuff like that so it's just warning you you know if you highlight the safe area that the area highlighted in blue is an area where your elements won't get obstructed now that doesn't mean that you can't put anything up here I mean we can go ahead and stretch that image all the way to the very top we just have to understand that there may be some text overlaying that like the carrier the time the symbols and such so this is going to come into play because when we add Auto layout constraints we can specify do we want that constraint like for instance if we're specifying a top margin for this element do we want that to be zero from the safe area or do we want it to be zero from the very edge of the screen all right so I'm going to show you that right now we're gonna highlight the uiimageview and then we're going to go down here to the bottom right and we're gonna click this add new constraints button and this menu pops up it's going to allow us to add some margin constraints for our uiimageview you can see four text boxes here one on each side and each of these text boxes represents the margin that we want to set for that uiimageview right here there are some default numbers and these numbers are just the current values if we wanted to have the UI image view look like this so you can see 235 here right now this length right here is 235 so we're gonna go ahead and change this to zero oh and I should mention that the values you see here will be different because when you drag that uiimageview into the view you'll probably have dropped it in a different place than I have so where I dropped it into the view these are the current margins so I've set this to 1 to 0 you can see that this constraint is active or I'm about to add it because this red line is highlighted now the other three margin lines are blanked out and down here you can see add one constraint if I change the number it kind of automatically activates that constraint and you can see down here it says add to constraints now if I click this button right now it's going to add this top constraint and this left constraint now I can actually click that and turn it on or off right now I'm not adding any constraints and right now I'm adding two constraints another thing I want to mention is this little triangle here these aren't actually text boxes they're actually dropdowns so if I click this you're going to see the safe area and the view this is what I was mentioning before do we want it to be zero margin from the safe area or from the view so I'm actually gonna change this to the view like that and be careful because it changes back to 235 when I select that so I'm gonna go ahead and hit 0 again so even for these ones I'm going to change it from safe area to the view to make sure it's actually to the very edge of the screen this one again change it to the vo and this one down here I'm going to change it to the view and then I'm going to set all of these to zero so a fast way to jump through the different text boxes is if you just press tab like that and then lastly we're going to uncheck constrain 2 margins because we want it to be to the very edge and not toward some margin and then down here it should say add 4 constraints so click that and immediately you're gonna see that uiimageview stretch to all 4 edges now it doesn't go all the way to the top I'm gonna double check what we added there if you look in the document outline you'll see that now you have this entry called constraints if we expand that you can see the four constraints which we added and clicking each of them you can look in the inspector pane on the right hand side and you can look at some configurable properties for it so let's take a look at the top one landscape top equals so somehow even though I set it to the view somehow it's changed itself back to the safe area so what we can do actually before I do that let me explain to you what this means so this constraint is saying to make the landscape landscape is our image view right the top edge of our image view equal to the top edge of the safe area right and zero this is what we specified but I don't want it to be zero from the safe area I actually want it to be zero from the view up here so I'm gonna pull this drop down down and I'm going to choose super view and super view is just a term to describe the view that contains our UI image view so let's click on super view and then you can see that this constant has changed to 20 and you can see that there is this bar here this constraint is indicating that my UI image view is now 20 from the super view top well I'm going to change that back to zero hit enter and now you can see that it's actually zero from the very very top instead of the safe area so I've just showed you that you can click on a constraint and you can edit it from this inspector panel now I want to show you that you can actually just remove them so if you make a mistake go ahead into this document outline right here you can hold down command or shift and you can click each of them like this and then just go ahead and hit delete on your keyboard if we do that this image view it looks like it's positioned correctly but in reality there are no constraints dictating how it should be positioned or sized so that's going to be a problem we've just deleted all of our constraints as extra practice we're gonna just riad them so let's click on the landscape right here this UI image view that is now named landscape I mean and then go down here to the bottom right and go to add new constraints and we're gonna do this again so first of all it looks like this one is safe area so I'm going to choose view this one safe here I'm going to select view instead this one I'm gonna select view this one is view ok and it's double check that it hasn't changed on me again and let's click add for constraints so there we go we have four again all right the next thing is that this image actually looks kind of stretched and looks distorted right if we highlight the image view here and go into the inspector panel there is a property called content mode and this dictates how the image should be stretched or if it should not be stretched right now it's set to scale to fill which means it's just going to stretch it however it needs to in order to fill up the whole image view for instance we can set it to just center and it's just not going to stretch it and there's actually a lot of overlap that you can't see right now or we can set it to aspect fit it's just going to try and fit the entire image without stretching it or we can set it at the aspect Phil it's going to enlarge it so that it fills the entire image view but it's not going to distort it because it's going to maintain the same height and width ratio so that won't look squished or stretched or anything like that so that's the one we're going to choose so then we get something that looks like this alright now we have to add our labels but we can't just add our labels here because that text is going to be pretty hard to read so we're going to create a little bit of a black background here so that we can put our labels on top of it and then it'll be easier to read so down here in the object library let's change this filter text instead of image view let's type in UI view when you do that you're going to see this element here that says view so this is kind of like a generic view that we can color and we can put things in we're going to go ahead and click that and drag that onto our screen just like that and having it highlighted in this document outline I'm going to go over to the inspector pane we're gonna change the background color so go ahead hit this drop down and choose black color and then you're going to click this little black rectangle here that's going to bring up this little menu with a couple of tabs if you choose this tab here it's gonna be all blocked but you can slide this opacity and you can make it semi opaque like that and I'm going to set to about 80% you can also just type it into this text box here and then we're going to go ahead and click that red X to close it and you can see that we have this beautiful sort of semitransparent black which we're going to put our labels on top of but first let's position this uiview so having it highlighted in our document outline I'm going to go over here and click add new constraints I'm going to just off the bat uncheck constrain to margins and I'm going to go ahead and enable the left the right and the bottom constraints and then I'm going to choose veal instead of safe area like that and change that and then I'm going to set these to zero notice that I'm not touching this top constraint and I'll show you why in a second I'm going to be zero there zero I'm gonna do zero let me just double check that it hasn't changed back to the safe area all right and we're gonna click add three constraints this time alright so you you're gonna see a couple of things here first of all it's stretch to the left and right because we added those constraints but now there's this red line here and it's supposed to stick to the bottom because we said it should be zero from the bottom but there's this red line here and over on the document outline you can see this little red arrow here if we click that you're going to see that there are some auto layout errors right here it says that it's missing some constraints it can't determine the Y position or the height so before our bottom constraint is going to take effect we're gonna need to set either a height for this view or a top constraint so that auto layout system has all the information it needs to be able to position that UI view so what we're going to do is highlight this view while holding down the command key click on this root view as well this is kind of like the the overall view that contains everything so okay let me try that again so highlight this view hold down command and then click this root view so you should have both of these highlighted in blue now and now with that I want to go down here add new constraints again and I want you to choose equal Heights and that is going to basically make this block dimmed view the same height as the root view which basically is this entire view right here but we're gonna do a little something special in order to make it dynamic so you're gonna see that in a second but for now make sure you have equal Heights checked on and then click add one constraint then you're gonna see basically the whole thing dimmed out and then a couple more constraints added in this constraints menu you can see that it's starting to get pretty confusing I can't really tell unless I really really try to read it I can't really tell which constraints have to do with the landscape and which constraints have to do with this view right so one easy way to tell if I only care about the constraints for this UI view for instance let's highlight it in the document outline here and then I'm going to go into the size inspector tab and if I scroll down it actually shows me that there are four constraints that relate to this element and like this I can easily tell which constraints that I want to modify so I actually want to modify this one equal height to super view I'm going to double click it well it's automatically going to highlight the constraint that I selected and then it's going to show me it's configurable properties here on the inspector pane so let me read this constraint to you the views height should be equal to the super views height so this is the view and this is the super view remember super view is just a fancy word for the view that contains that element so you can see that if I collapse this view everything is inside of it right so this view actually contains everything inside of it all right so if you have this reversed if you have super view dot height is equal to view dot height I want you to go down here and click on reverse first and second item if I click that you're gonna see super view height equal view height i don't want that i want you to click this reverse first and second item the first item should be view height because that's what you're trying to specify so our rule states that the views height should be equal to the super views height and down here there's a multiplier I want to change this to zero point three when I do that that's saying that the views height should be equal to zero point three times the soup views height and this is going to set the height so that it's about a third or about thirty percent of the entire height and this is going to be dynamic it doesn't matter how tall the root view is it's always going to be thirty percent of that height all right now in the bottom right hand corner let's change this UI view filter text let's type in label because we're about to add some labels and let's click and let's drag this into this block area this UI view when you do that you can see that my label is actually inside of this UI view now because this UI view is actually a container view it can contain other elements and now that my label is inside that view when I specify my auto layout constraints let's say I want it to be zero from the top it's going to be zero from the top of this UI view it's not going to be zero from the top of this route view right because you're always specifying the positioning constraints relative to the parent that contains it alright so since this view contains my label if I position my label zero from the top it's going to be based on the top of this view which is fine that's exactly what I want so let's highlight this label in the document outline let's go into the attributes inspector here first of all let's change the color so we can actually read it we're going to choose white color and let's change the label the city by the sea and don't worry that it's kind of cut off right now we're going to address that and then I'm going to click this little icon here so we can change it to a bold type of font and I'm just going to up the size to something like 24 and then we're going to specify some auto layout constraints for this guy so with this label highlighted I'm going to go down here to add constraints and we are going to let's do those constraints the top the left and the right so for the top I'm going to say 20 from the left I'm going to say 20 and from the right I'm going to say 20 as well and then we're going to click add three constraints and you're going to see something like this we're gonna add a little description label below that so let's click this label and let's pop it into there as well and now you can see in this document outline that my view contains two labels so highlight this second label let's configure some properties so let's change it to white let's change the font and we'll leave it at seventeen and we're gonna set some constraints for this guy so make sure it's highlighted here and then click on add new constraints down here and this time we are going to again we're going to do that but if you pull this drop down down you're going to see that you can position it relative to the label that's directly above it so we're going to choose that we're not going to choose the view so position it relative to the element that's right above it and I'm going to say that it should be ten points below that title label the left will be 20 and the right will be 20 as well and then I'm going to add these three constraints and they see something like that now I'm going to go back to these properties there are a couple things I forgot to set for example I want to type a sentence so this is such a beautiful place and if we wanted to make it multiline all we have to do down here is change that lines by default it's 1 let's change it to 0 and if I typed more text it's going to be multiline but I'm gonna leave it like that for now now that we've created this beautiful layout we're going to preview it in different screen sizes and orientations and the way we do that you might have noticed down here it says view as iPhone 8 if I click this I bring it up you can actually see a whole bunch of different screen sizes and orientations so the one I'm looking at right now is iPhone 8 but you can go up so let's say click this this is the iPhone X sometimes if you don't see this entire view or some if it's blocked out or maybe it's the screen is all white try zooming in and then zooming out to force that view to kind of refresh and redraw itself now let's go up again this is the iPhone 8 plus so you see here I have a white screen I'm just gonna click I'm gonna zoom in so you see now it's just redrawn if you don't have these controls here and maybe that you're maybe on a laptop screen and you can't see this you need to make a little more space click this document outline button to just hide the document outline and you'll probably get your zoom buttons down here all right so let's go downwards now so we were looking at the iPhone 8 that's where we started let's go downwards this is the iPhone se and this is the iPhone 4s now we're going to change the orientation we're going to click on landscape here as you can see that everything's adapted itself because all of our constraints are dynamic and you can see that this still takes up a 30% of the height of the screen we're going to go upwards this is the iPhone se iPhone 8 the iPhone 10 and again part of it is cropped let's go like that so you can see that here it's kind of a little bit almost touching our text label here now if we had specified that the left side of the UI image view and the UI view should be relative to the safe area and not to the very edge then we wouldn't have come into this notch area actually this part right here this part is considered a safe area let me see if I yeah if I click on safe area right here you can see a blue outline you can see that this left edge of the screen this is not in the safe area and you can see that this part is not in the safe area and also this part down here is not in the safe area since we kind of ignored the safe area and we specified our elements the very edges that's why this text is so closely here in order to fix this we might just increase the margin on the left side or something like that all right let's move on let's go to the next device we've got the A+ this white screen let's zoom out zoom in so there you go now one thing I ought to mention is that this area down here lets you preview your layout in multiple screen sizes orientations but it also allows you to add constraints that are specific to a certain screen size and the way you do that is this button here very for constraints if you accidentally click this and then let's say you clicked something like that and then this area became blue then you're actually at this point you're going to be adding constraints that are specific to this right here and you're not actually specifying constraints to be specific to a screen size but there's something called size classes which each size class actually contains a bunch of different screen sizes it's like a category of screen sizes this is something that we'll cover down the line I want to warn you about it right now be just in case this area looks blue for you if it does you have to click on this done varying and chances are the constraints that you added were specific to whatever screen size you accidentally selected so I would at this point advise you after you you click on done varying if you had accidentally clicked it before is to now go ahead and delete all your constraints and kind of redo it and riad it but for most of you if you didn't click this button before and you didn't know about it or you didn't notice it and it's not blue chances are you don't have anything to worry about so now I'm gonna run it in the simulator so I'm gonna go ahead and select the iPhone 8 simulator I'm gonna click run I'm gonna see it launched in our simulator just like that and in order to rotate the device you can go up to hardware you can go down to rotate left or rotate right and as you can see there shortcut keys you can hold down command and press the left arrow or right arrow you can actually even just choose one like this from your orientation if I'm going to use the shortcut keys so on my keyboard let's press command and left you can see that it's just rotated rotate it back rotate it the other way now so there you have it today you learned about Auto layout and what the safe area is you learned how to add edit and delete constraints you also learn how to check your layout under different screen sizes and orientations now how would you like to get some extra practice and build another user interface I've got a worksheet for you to do just that go through it and build this user interface first I've got a question for you for the app that you want to build are you going to be focused on the iPad screen size or the iPhone screen size let me know by leaving a quick comment below if you liked this video please subscribe to my channel by clicking the subscribe button below and if you don't want to miss a single video make sure you click that Bell icon as well lastly don't forget to grab that worksheet and get some extra practice with Auto layout just follow the URL on the screen or click on the URL in the description below the video thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next lesson
