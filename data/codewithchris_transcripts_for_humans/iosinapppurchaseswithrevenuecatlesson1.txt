00:00 - in this tutorial series you'll be
00:02 - building this demo which features
00:03 - in-app subscriptions you'll learn how to
00:06 - set up renewable subscription
00:08 - in-app purchases you'll learn how to
00:10 - display those in-app purchases
00:11 - in your app and let users buy them and
00:14 - you'll learn how to programmatically
00:15 - check the user's level of access
00:17 - so that you can unlock the paid content
00:19 - if they've bought the subscription
00:21 - hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to
00:23 - code with chris the place to be if you
00:24 - want to learn how to code and build apps
00:26 - now there's a lot of talk about how
00:28 - difficult and finicky it is to
00:30 - implement in-app purchases in your app
00:33 - and you know what people are right it
00:34 - can be a nightmare and that's why i
00:36 - haven't covered in-app purchases on this
00:38 - channel
00:38 - up until now the folks over at revenue
00:41 - cat reached out and were kind enough to
00:43 - sponsor this video for me to check out
00:45 - their platform
00:46 - to see how they help us implement in-app
00:48 - purchases
00:49 - and you know what i found out using
00:51 - revenue cad it only takes a few lines of
00:53 - code
00:53 - to implement in-app purchases in your
00:56 - app in addition to that it
00:58 - also makes it easy for you to get
00:59 - detailed analytics about how users
01:01 - are interacting with your in-app
01:03 - purchases and to also experiment with
01:05 - different offers
01:06 - so that you can optimize the revenue per
01:08 - user it's such a smooth experience
01:11 - and this is what i want to show you
01:12 - through this app series so here's how
01:14 - we're going to do it
01:15 - step one we're going to set up the
01:17 - accounts that we need and this includes
01:19 - an apple developer program membership as
01:21 - well as a free revenue cad account
01:23 - step 2 we're going to set up our xcode
01:26 - project for the demo we saw earlier
01:28 - and we're going to set up our app store
01:30 - listing through the app store connect
01:32 - portal
01:33 - after that we're going to configure our
01:35 - in-app subscriptions
01:36 - through the app store connect portal
01:38 - i'll show you how to set pricing i'll
01:40 - show you some best practices and tips
01:41 - for configuring your in-app purchases so
01:43 - that
01:44 - you can build your product catalog in
01:46 - the future without it becoming a big
01:48 - mess
01:49 - after that we're going to add our app to
01:51 - the revenue cat platform and we're going
01:52 - to configure our products
01:54 - offers and entitlements and this is
01:55 - where the magic happens it's going to
01:57 - allow us to easily implement in-app
01:58 - purchases
01:59 - in our app even if it spans across
02:01 - multiple platforms
02:02 - and it's going to allow us to mix and
02:04 - match different products with offers and
02:06 - allow us to experiment with which ones
02:09 - work best with our users
02:11 - step five we're going to get down and
02:12 - dirty with xcode and we're actually
02:13 - going to build that demo that you saw
02:15 - earlier
02:16 - after that we're going to add the
02:17 - revenue sdk to our xcode project
02:19 - then we're going to add those couple of
02:21 - code snippets that's going to allow us
02:22 - to pull our offers down to display
02:24 - in-app
02:25 - it's going to allow the user to make
02:26 - purchases and it's going to allow us to
02:28 - check the level of access that the user
02:30 - should have
02:31 - and that's how we know what content to
02:33 - unlock
02:34 - in our app finally i'll show you how to
02:37 - set up some sandbox test user accounts
02:39 - so that you can actually
02:40 - test those in-app purchases in a sandbox
02:43 - environment
02:44 - on an actual device in this lesson we'll
02:46 - get started with steps one and two
02:48 - let's go all right so let's set up the
02:51 - two accounts we need the first one
02:53 - is an apple developer program account
02:56 - now it's not enough to have an apple
02:58 - developer account you need to be
03:00 - enrolled in the apple developer program
03:02 - that you see here and the reason for
03:04 - that is because
03:06 - it's going to allow you to submit apps
03:08 - to the app store
03:10 - and in turn be able to set up app
03:12 - listings
03:13 - and configure in-app purchases for your
03:15 - app if you're not enrolled in the
03:17 - program unfortunately you won't even
03:19 - have access to the portal
03:20 - where you're going to be able to
03:22 - configure those in-app purchases
03:24 - for your app so that's number one number
03:27 - two is you're going to need a
03:29 - free revenue cat account now revenue cat
03:32 - doesn't just make it easier for you to
03:34 - implement in-app purchases
03:35 - into your app but it also has a lot of
03:38 - additional features for you to
03:39 - track your analytics and experiment and
03:43 - mix different products and
03:44 - offers to see which ones convert better
03:47 - and in turn
03:48 - make you more money the best thing about
03:50 - it is that it's free to use
03:51 - until you're making ten thousand dollars
03:53 - per month in revenue
03:55 - and hey if you're at that point you'll
03:57 - definitely have enough money to invest
03:58 - in a tool like revenue cat
04:00 - which is going to in turn make you even
04:02 - more money so
04:03 - to sign up for your free account go to
04:06 - cwc.to
04:07 - revcat now i don't get any compensation
04:10 - for that
04:10 - but it does let the team know that you
04:12 - guys are interested in seeing more
04:14 - content on in-app purchases
04:16 - and app monetization so if you want to
04:18 - see more tutorials
04:20 - in that area then definitely go through
04:22 - that link cwc.to
04:24 - revcat to sign up for your free revenue
04:27 - cat account
04:28 - all right now we're on to step two we're
04:30 - going to create our xcode project
04:32 - and then we're going to jump into the
04:34 - app store connect portal and set up that
04:36 - app store listing
04:37 - in preparation for configuring our
04:39 - in-app purchases
04:40 - so here i've got xcode open i'm going to
04:42 - create a brand new xcode project
04:45 - and i'm going to let me just move that
04:47 - up here
04:48 - i'm going to choose single view app and
04:50 - for this product name i'm going to call
04:52 - it the
04:52 - revcat demo and
04:56 - all of this is going to be the same
04:57 - language as swift user interfaces
04:59 - storyboard for this project
05:01 - and you're not going to be needing any
05:03 - of these options so
05:04 - leave those all unchecked what's really
05:07 - important to note here
05:08 - is this bundle identifier com.code with
05:12 - chris.revcat-demo
05:13 - and this string here is comprised of
05:16 - this information that you have up here
05:19 - that's going to be really important
05:20 - because we're going to need this for our
05:22 - app store listing
05:24 - let's go ahead and click next to create
05:26 - this project
05:27 - and i'm just going to go ahead and save
05:29 - that on my desktop
05:33 - and as you can see here in the project
05:35 - properties this is the bundle identifier
05:37 - that we're going to need
05:39 - the next thing i want you to do is go
05:41 - over to the signing in capabilities tab
05:43 - and just take a look at what you have
05:45 - here you should have it
05:47 - automatically manage signing if you've
05:50 - attached your apple developer account to
05:53 - your xcode preferences
05:54 - and what it's going to do is it's going
05:57 - to generate all of the
05:58 - provisioning profiles app ids and
06:00 - certificates that you need
06:02 - all automatically under this bundle
06:04 - identifier now sometimes it doesn't
06:07 - generate that app id right away
06:09 - but there's one thing that we can do
06:10 - here to sort of get
06:12 - xcode to automatically generate those
06:14 - things straight away
06:16 - click on plus capability here and scroll
06:19 - down
06:20 - all the way to in-app purchases and you
06:23 - can go ahead double-click that
06:25 - and add that right here you saw some
06:27 - activity happening there it was
06:28 - generating the app id based on this
06:31 - bundle identifier
06:32 - the provisioning profile and all of that
06:34 - stuff now don't worry
06:35 - if you weren't able to add this
06:37 - capability right now or you weren't able
06:39 - to get this part to work
06:40 - i'll show you later in the portal how
06:43 - you can manually
06:44 - generate that app id and provisioning
06:46 - profiles all right so now with your
06:48 - xcode project set up we have our bundle
06:50 - identifier and we should have our app id
06:53 - what we're going to do is jump into the
06:55 - app store connect portal
06:57 - and this is something you get access to
06:59 - when you enroll in the apple developer
07:01 - program
07:01 - you manage your app store listings here
07:03 - you can look at analytics and how
07:05 - they've been selling
07:07 - you can also submit all of your banking
07:09 - and contract information
07:11 - i mean where's apple going to send your
07:12 - money right
07:14 - all of that sort of stuff and here in
07:16 - users and access you can
07:17 - set up other administrators and also
07:20 - test users which we'll get to
07:22 - in the latter part of this series
07:23 - because we're gonna need to test our
07:25 - in-app purchases and this is where we
07:27 - would set up our test users as well
07:29 - so the first thing we want to do is go
07:30 - into my apps and we're going to set up a
07:33 - new app store listing for the demo that
07:35 - we just created
07:36 - so click on the plus icon up here and
07:39 - choose new app
07:40 - and we're going to select the ios
07:42 - platform and
07:44 - for this name we're going to choose
07:48 - revcat demo let's set the primary
07:52 - language to
07:53 - english i'm going to set it to
07:56 - canada because i'm canadian and for the
07:59 - bundle identifier
08:00 - this is where we want to look for that
08:02 - bundle id that we had set
08:04 - in our xcode project so hit this drop
08:06 - down and
08:07 - see if you can find it see if you can
08:09 - find revenue
08:11 - or whatever you used for me it's this
08:13 - one right here
08:14 - com dot code with chris dot red rev cat
08:18 - demo if you can't find your bundle id in
08:20 - this drop down right here what you're
08:22 - going to need to do
08:23 - is go to the provisioning portal and
08:26 - that's at developer.apple.com
08:29 - account you log in with your apple
08:32 - account
08:32 - that is enrolled in the apple developer
08:34 - program and you're going to see on the
08:36 - left hand side
08:37 - navigation certificates ids and profiles
08:40 - so go ahead and click that and you're
08:43 - going to want to go to
08:45 - identifiers so here you're going to
08:48 - manually add the app id
08:50 - since it hasn't automatically been
08:52 - generated yet by xcode so go ahead and
08:54 - hit this plus icon
08:57 - and register a new app id click continue
09:01 - choose app as the type click continue
09:05 - and in the bundle id here you would
09:08 - basically
09:09 - copy what you have an xcode for this
09:11 - bundle identifier
09:13 - and you would paste it in here and then
09:16 - you would set up some description
09:18 - and under capabilities just double check
09:21 - that in-app purchases
09:22 - is enabled or at least enabled and
09:25 - grayed out
09:27 - you know if that's the case let's see we
09:29 - have to put in some sort of demo here
09:31 - revcatdemo then you would hit continue
09:35 - and you would go through the rest of the
09:36 - wizard
09:36 - to create this or register this app id
09:39 - with this bundle identifier
09:41 - after you do that you go back to this
09:45 - app store connect portal and you're
09:47 - going to have to cancel out of this
09:49 - dialog
09:50 - and just hit refresh on the entire page
09:54 - and then try to add your app again
09:57 - and go through that same process that
10:01 - we just went through set the primary
10:03 - language
10:04 - and your bundle id and app id should
10:07 - show up here now
10:10 - okay so sku is for internal purposes
10:13 - i'm just going to call this rcdemo3
10:17 - user access we can just leave it as the
10:20 - default right now
10:22 - unless you do have multiple users on
10:23 - your account and you know what to select
10:25 - here
10:28 - let's go ahead and create our new app so
10:31 - once this app store listing has been
10:32 - created
10:33 - now we're going to be able to customize
10:35 - the in-app purchases
10:37 - if you look at the left-hand side
10:39 - navigation you'll see in-app purchases
10:41 - go ahead and click manage all right so
10:44 - here we're going to click this little
10:45 - blue plus icon
10:46 - and you're going to see that there are
10:47 - different types of in-app purchases that
10:49 - we can create
10:50 - in this app series i'm going to show you
10:52 - how to do
10:54 - auto-renewable subscriptions but you can
10:56 - see that there are also consumable
10:58 - which are things like potions and
11:02 - magic items that you can buy in games
11:04 - for example or credits
11:06 - things that can be used up
11:08 - non-consumable
11:09 - are unlockables so things like maybe
11:12 - unlocking
11:13 - a race track in a game that you would
11:15 - indefinitely have access to
11:18 - or unlocking extra levels or unlocking
11:21 - costumes in a game or something like
11:22 - that
11:23 - uh auto renewable subscription is
11:25 - something that you're probably used to
11:27 - it's
11:27 - it's like your netflix subscription or
11:29 - your spotify subscription it just renews
11:31 - every billing period
11:33 - and non-renewing subscription is the
11:35 - same thing except that
11:37 - at the end of the period it doesn't
11:39 - automatically renew
11:40 - so the next video we're going to go
11:42 - forward with auto renewable subscription
11:44 - and i'll show you how to set these
11:45 - things up
11:46 - all right so far we've completed steps
11:48 - one and two in our outline
11:50 - we've enrolled in the apple developer
11:52 - program and we've set up our free
11:54 - revenue cad account if you haven't done
11:55 - that already go through the link cwc.to
11:59 - revcat to sign up for your free revenue
12:01 - cat account again i'm not going to be
12:03 - compensated
12:03 - in any way if you do that but it is
12:05 - going to allow their team to know that
12:07 - we want to see more content on in-app
12:09 - purchases and app monetization
12:11 - so if that is the case for you then
12:13 - definitely go through that link and sign
12:14 - up for your free account
12:16 - all right now i want to turn it over to
12:17 - you do you want to monetize your app and
12:19 - make money off of it
12:20 - or is it going to be free without
12:22 - monetization let me know by leaving a
12:24 - quick comment below
12:25 - lastly if you like this video please
12:27 - give it a thumbs up and don't forget to
12:28 - subscribe so you don't miss the next
12:30 - lesson
12:31 - in the next lesson we're going to
12:32 - configure our in-app subscription
12:34 - products
12:35 - in the app store connect portal alright
12:37 - thanks for watching i'll see you there

Cleaned transcript:

in this tutorial series you'll be building this demo which features inapp subscriptions you'll learn how to set up renewable subscription inapp purchases you'll learn how to display those inapp purchases in your app and let users buy them and you'll learn how to programmatically check the user's level of access so that you can unlock the paid content if they've bought the subscription hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to code with chris the place to be if you want to learn how to code and build apps now there's a lot of talk about how difficult and finicky it is to implement inapp purchases in your app and you know what people are right it can be a nightmare and that's why i haven't covered inapp purchases on this channel up until now the folks over at revenue cat reached out and were kind enough to sponsor this video for me to check out their platform to see how they help us implement inapp purchases and you know what i found out using revenue cad it only takes a few lines of code to implement inapp purchases in your app in addition to that it also makes it easy for you to get detailed analytics about how users are interacting with your inapp purchases and to also

it step one we're going to set up the accounts that we need and this includes an apple developer program membership as well as a free revenue cad account step 2 we're going to set up our xcode project

test user accounts so that you can actually test those inapp purchases in a sandbox environment on an actual device in this lesson we'll get started with steps one and two let's go all right so let's set up the two accounts we need the first one is an apple developer program account now it's not enough to have an apple developer account you need to be enrolled in the apple developer program that you see here and the reason for that is because it's going to allow you to submit apps to the app store and in turn be able to set up app listings and configure inapp purchases for your app if you're not enrolled in the program unfortunately you won't even have access to the portal where you're going to be able to configure those inapp purchases for your app so that's number one number two is you're going to need a free revenue cat account now revenue cat doesn't just make it easier for you to implement inapp purchases into your app but it also has a lot of additional features for you to track your analytics and experiment and mix different products and offers to see which ones convert better and in turn make you more money the best thing about it is that it's free to use until you're making ten thousand dollars per month in revenue and hey if you're at that point you'll definitely have enough money to invest in a tool like revenue cat which is going to in turn make you even more money so to sign up for your free account go to cwc.to revcat now i don't get any compensation for that but it does let the team know that you guys are interested in seeing more content on inapp purchases and app monetization so if you want to see more tutorials in that area then definitely go through that link cwc.to revcat to sign up for your free revenue cat account all right now we're on to step two we're going to create our xcode project and then we're going to jump into the app store connect portal and set up that app store listing in preparation for configuring our inapp purchases so here i've got xcode open i'm going to create a brand new xcode project and i'm going to let me just move that up here i'm going to choose single view app and for this product name i'm going to call it the revcat demo and all of this is going to be the same language as swift user interfaces storyboard for this project and you're not going to be needing any of these options so leave those all unchecked what's really important to note here is this bundle identifier com.code with chris.revcatdemo and this string here is comprised of this information that you have up here that's going to be really important because we're going to need this for our app store listing let's go ahead and click next to create this project and i'm just going to go ahead and save that on my desktop and as you can see here in the project properties this is the bundle identifier that we're going to need the next thing i want you to do is go over to the signing in capabilities tab and just take a look at what you have here you should have it automatically manage signing if you've attached your apple developer account to your xcode preferences and what it's going to do is it's going to generate all of the provisioning profiles app ids and certificates that you need all automatically under this bundle identifier now sometimes it doesn't generate that app id right away but there's one thing that we can do here to sort of get xcode to automatically generate those things straight away click on plus capability here and scroll down all the way to inapp purchases and you can go ahead doubleclick that and add that right here you saw some activity happening there it was generating the app id based on this bundle identifier the provisioning profile and all of that stuff now don't worry if you weren't able to add this capability right now or you weren't able to get this part to work i'll show you later in the portal how you can manually generate that app id and provisioning profiles all right so now with your xcode project set up we have our bundle identifier and we should have our app id what we're going to do is jump into the app store connect portal and this is something you get access to when you enroll in the apple developer program you manage your app store listings here you can look at analytics and how they've been selling you can also submit all of your banking and contract

latter part of this series because we're gonna need to test our inapp purchases and this is where we would set up our test users as well so the first thing we want to do is go into my apps and we're going to set up a new app store listing for the demo that we just created so click on the plus icon up here and choose new app and we're going to select the ios platform and for this name we're going to choose revcat demo let's set the primary language to english i'm going to set it to canada because i'm canadian and for the bundle identifier this is where we want to look for that bundle id that we had set in our xcode project so hit this drop down and see if you can find it see if you can find revenue or whatever you used for me it's this one right here com dot code with chris dot red rev cat demo if you can't find your bundle id in this drop down right here what you're going to need to do is go to the provisioning portal and that's at developer.apple.com account you log in with your apple account that is enrolled in the apple developer program and you're going to see on the left hand side navigation certificates ids and profiles so go ahead and click that and you're going to want to go to identifiers so here you're going to manually add the app id since it hasn't automatically been generated yet by xcode so go ahead and hit this plus icon and register a new app id click continue choose app as the type click continue and in the bundle id here you would basically copy what you have an xcode for this bundle identifier and you would paste it in here and then you would set up some description and under capabilities just double check that inapp purchases is enabled or at least enabled and grayed out you know if that's the case let's see we have to put in some sort of demo here revcatdemo then you would hit continue and you would go through the rest of the wizard to create this or register this app id with this bundle identifier after you do that you go back to this app store connect portal and you're going to have to cancel out of this dialog and just hit refresh on the entire page and then try to add your app again and go through that same process that we just went through set the primary language and your bundle id and app id should show up here now okay so sku is for internal purposes i'm just going to call this rcdemo3 user access we can just leave it as the default right now unless you do have multiple users on your account and you know what to select here let's go ahead and create our new app so once this app store listing has been created now we're going to be able to customize the inapp purchases if you look at the lefthand side navigation you'll see inapp purchases go ahead and click manage all right so here we're going to click this little blue plus icon and you're going to see that there are different types of inapp purchases that we can create in this app series i'm going to show you how to do autorenewable subscriptions but you can see that there are also consumable which are things like potions and magic items that you can buy in games for example or credits things that can be used up nonconsumable are unlockables so things like maybe unlocking a race track in a game that you would indefinitely have access to or unlocking extra levels or unlocking costumes in a game or something like that uh auto renewable subscription is something that you're probably used to it's it's like your netflix subscription or your spotify subscription it just renews every billing period and nonrenewing subscription is the same thing except that at the end of the period it doesn't automatically renew so the next video we're going to go forward with auto renewable subscription and i'll show you how to set these things up all right so far we've completed steps one and two in our outline we've enrolled in the apple developer program and we've set up our free revenue cad account if you haven't done that already go through the link cwc.to revcat to sign up for your free revenue cat account again i'm not going to be compensated in any way if you do that but it is going to allow their team to know that we want to see more content on inapp purchases and app monetization so if that is the case for you then definitely go through that link and sign up for your free account all right now i want to turn it over to you do you want to monetize your app and make money off of it or is it going to be free without monetization let me know by leaving a quick comment below lastly if you like this video please give it a
