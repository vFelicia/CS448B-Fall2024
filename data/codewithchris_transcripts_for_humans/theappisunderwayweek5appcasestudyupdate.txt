00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - hey code crew it's chris here
00:07 - so on the screen you're gonna see some
00:08 - footage of me testing out a couple of
00:10 - different
00:11 - instagram related apps on the app store
00:13 - um but i wanted
00:14 - just to show something on the screen
00:16 - while i talk so that it's more
00:18 - interesting
00:19 - essentially it's been a few weeks since
00:21 - i updated you guys on the progress of
00:24 - this case study
00:25 - and we have made some progress so in
00:26 - this video i wanted to show you
00:28 - what the app idea is and how we went
00:31 - about
00:32 - sort of validating the idea doing our
00:34 - app store research
00:35 - as well as our progress so far so let's
00:38 - start with what the app idea is
00:40 - it's an app to check out other people's
00:42 - instagram profiles
00:43 - and get some insights on what's working
00:46 - for them
00:46 - so the idea for this app came out of our
00:49 - own
00:50 - needs because i remember when i first
00:53 - started
00:54 - the code with chris instagram account uh
00:57 - one of the
00:58 - things i did was to scope out other
00:59 - people's profiles
01:01 - in the space and sort of see what they
01:03 - were posting and what was working for
01:04 - them what sort of hashtags they used
01:06 - and so this app is going to do that
01:10 - automatically so that started out as an
01:13 - idea
01:14 - in addition to identifying that as
01:17 - something i needed i was also heavily
01:20 - influenced by
01:21 - a recent podcast episode that i listened
01:24 - to
01:24 - from sub club it's a podcast by revenue
01:27 - cat
01:28 - and in particular i'm referring to
01:30 - episode six with zach
01:32 - he has a couple of instagram related
01:34 - apps that i've used before
01:36 - and listening to this podcast and how he
01:39 - came about
01:40 - doing those apps and it really inspired
01:42 - me
01:43 - to think about how to create apps
01:46 - as a product rather than you know our
01:48 - initial idea of creating
01:50 - essentially a business and so i highly
01:52 - recommend you check out this episode six
01:54 - of the sub club podcast
01:56 - if you're interested um but in short
01:59 - listening this episode sort of um made
02:02 - me think about instagram first and if
02:04 - there were
02:05 - if there was space for another instagram
02:07 - related app
02:08 - so taking that idea that i had the next
02:11 - thing that we did
02:12 - was to check out the instagram api and
02:15 - see what sort of data we could get from
02:16 - there
02:17 - so we started by looking at the
02:19 - instagram graph api and they actually
02:21 - have two different apis a basic display
02:23 - api and a graph api
02:24 - the basic display api you can get basic
02:27 - information about users and
02:29 - their images videos and albums but the
02:32 - graph api is more for
02:34 - like business related apps and
02:35 - professional apps and so
02:37 - uh this one actually has an end point
02:40 - that we were
02:41 - we thought we could use such as this one
02:44 - getting basic data about other instagram
02:46 - business users and creators
02:48 - the limitation however is that that
02:50 - profile has to be a business
02:52 - profile or business account that doesn't
02:54 - mean that they have to be a business
02:56 - um in on instagram you can turn your
02:59 - account into a
03:00 - business account which gives you
03:02 - additional metrics and stuff like that
03:04 - so the person you're looking up has to
03:06 - have
03:08 - has to have turned their account into a
03:09 - business account but you can get some
03:12 - useful information from here such as
03:15 - their follower account their media
03:18 - account and
03:19 - you know details about their media so we
03:21 - decided to go with this endpoint and
03:23 - see what data we could get we started
03:25 - playing around with it
03:27 - creating a sample xcode project and
03:30 - making the call to the api and getting
03:32 - the data back and then
03:33 - running some computations on it and
03:37 - and things look promising the next thing
03:38 - we did was we went on the app store and
03:41 - i
03:41 - started looking at the top charts of the
03:43 - social media
03:45 - charts in the app store and downloading
03:46 - some of the apps and playing with it
03:48 - what i noticed was that most of those
03:50 - instagram related apps they all
03:53 - pretty much did the same thing which was
03:54 - um look at your own profile
03:56 - see who unfollowed you see who blocked
03:59 - you and stuff like that
04:00 - and i didn't really see apps related to
04:03 - you know looking at insights for other
04:04 - people's profiles
04:05 - and i found that kind of strange and
04:08 - that could be a red flag
04:09 - might mean that nobody wants the app
04:12 - idea that
04:13 - that we are trying to do right now uh or
04:15 - it could mean
04:16 - that it's just the gap right uh
04:20 - next we use some tools like sensor tower
04:23 - and app annie to
04:24 - take a look at these apps and how
04:27 - they're doing
04:28 - and we found out that you know these
04:30 - sort of apps get a lot of downloads and
04:32 - people
04:32 - are willing to spend money on them and
04:35 - that is
04:36 - encouraging so knowing all of that we
04:38 - decided to push forward especially
04:40 - because
04:41 - we felt like we could get this app done
04:44 - relatively quickly i mean it's not a
04:45 - super complex app
04:47 - right you're just making a single call
04:49 - to this endpoint
04:50 - you're getting the data back and you're
04:52 - just running some computations and then
04:53 - throwing it on the screen so we thought
04:56 - it's worth a try
04:57 - it's not too much investment so in terms
05:00 - of development we sort of had two
05:02 - streams going on
05:03 - one stream was development where we were
05:05 - checking out the instagram api
05:07 - and working with that getting the data
05:09 - crunching the metrics getting that ready
05:11 - on the other hand we were also trying to
05:14 - design
05:15 - how that profile analytics screen would
05:17 - look like so here are some
05:19 - wireframes we're still working on sort
05:22 - of placement and layout
05:24 - of the information how we can convey
05:26 - that data
05:28 - clearly at a glance so
05:31 - while we lock once we lock this down we
05:33 - can then
05:35 - display the information in that fashion
05:37 - and then we can proceed with
05:38 - designing you know colors
05:42 - animations that sort of thing and the
05:44 - user journey
05:45 - we haven't really talked about the user
05:47 - flow
05:48 - through all the screens of the app we
05:50 - were just focused on this
05:52 - this one screen the profile view so next
05:55 - i want to show you inside
05:56 - xcode what we have alright so here's our
05:59 - xcode project and what we've got
06:01 - so far because we haven't locked down
06:03 - those wireframes yet
06:05 - all we're doing is just throwing that
06:07 - data and all of these metrics
06:09 - on the screen as you can see and we've
06:12 - also added a little
06:13 - a little user management part so that we
06:16 - can look at different profiles
06:18 - although ultimately we haven't talked
06:22 - about that user journey so
06:23 - what you see here in terms of you know
06:26 - editing
06:26 - adding removing profiles this is all
06:30 - up in the air in terms of development
06:34 - we at this point i think we are sort of
06:37 - stalled
06:38 - because we need to lock down how things
06:40 - will look um
06:41 - before we can proceed we have most of
06:45 - the plumbing and
06:46 - all of the you know wiring for working
06:48 - with the instagram api and computing the
06:50 - metrics
06:51 - we are now um taking a look at adding
06:54 - unit tests to our project as well as
06:57 - improving the efficiency for the app
06:59 - so that you know we're caching data um
07:02 - and we're not recomputing things and
07:04 - making
07:05 - more api calls than necessary so that's
07:08 - sort of what's going on
07:09 - with the app it's you know i i feel like
07:12 - it's really good progress for
07:14 - the past two weeks and we still have
07:16 - some things to work out
07:18 - for the access token because when you
07:21 - make these api calls
07:23 - uh you need to pass through an access
07:25 - token
07:26 - and most of the apps that i saw in the
07:27 - app store they have
07:30 - the people log in to instagram into
07:32 - their instagram account and use that
07:33 - access token
07:34 - i don't know if we're actually gonna
07:36 - have to do that so that's something that
07:38 - we're gonna explore next week
07:39 - all right so i hope that was interesting
07:40 - to you i'll try to do one of these
07:42 - update videos once a week at the end of
07:44 - the week so that you can
07:46 - follow along on the progress alright
07:47 - thanks for watching i'll see you guys in
07:49 - the next one

Cleaned transcript:

hey code crew it's chris here so on the screen you're gonna see some footage of me testing out a couple of different instagram related apps on the app store um but i wanted just to show something on the screen while i talk so that it's more interesting essentially it's been a few weeks since i updated you guys on the progress of this case study and we have made some progress so in this video i wanted to show you what the app idea is and how we went about sort of validating the idea doing our app store research as well as our progress so far so let's start with what the app idea is it's an app to check out other people's instagram profiles and get some insights on what's working for them so the idea for this app came out of our own needs because i remember when i first started the code with chris instagram account uh one of the things i did was to scope out other people's profiles in the space and sort of see what they were posting and what was working for them what sort of hashtags they used and so this app is going to do that automatically so that started out as an idea in addition to identifying that as something i needed i was also heavily influenced by a recent podcast episode that i listened to from sub club it's a podcast by revenue cat and in particular i'm referring to episode six with zach he has a couple of instagram related apps that i've used before and listening to this podcast and how he came about doing those apps and it really inspired me to think about how to create apps as a product rather than you know our initial idea of creating essentially a business and so i highly recommend you check out this episode six of the sub club podcast if you're interested um but in short listening this episode sort of um made me think about instagram first and if there were if there was space for another instagram related app so taking that idea that i had the next thing that we did was to check out the instagram api and see what sort of data we could
