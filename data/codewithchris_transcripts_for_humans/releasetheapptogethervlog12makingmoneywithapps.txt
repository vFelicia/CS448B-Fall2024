00:00 - Hello, and welcome back to the series.
00:01 - Now it's been a hot minute since the last
update over three months to be exact,
00:05 - but I do have some good news for you.
00:07 - The mood tracker app, which we have
renamed to emotion tracker because of ASO
00:11 - and keyword purposes, which I'll record
a video on in the future, by the way,
00:15 - the good news is that it's past app store
review and it's ready to be released.
00:20 - And you and I in this video at the
end, we are going to click this
00:23 - button and release this together.
00:26 - But first, in case you're new here
to the series, this is a raw and
00:29 - unscripted video format where I share
the behind the scenes look at the team
00:34 - and I trying to make money with apps.
00:36 - So by you watching over our shoulder
and seeing the mistakes that we make,
00:40 - hopefully you don't have to make the
same mistakes and waste your time.
00:42 - This vlog entry is dated August 9th.
00:46 - All right, so In the last vlog
entry, which was approximately
00:49 - three months ago, we had gone to a
state where the app was fully built.
00:54 - We had identified a list of
bugs and we were fixing them.
00:59 - And we went through several rounds
of this to see how long this list is.
01:03 - But also keep in mind that the mood
tracker app isn't our only priority.
01:08 - We do tons of other code with
Chris stuff, releasing training
01:11 - and content and things like that.
01:13 - This was just part of our daily work.
01:15 - So it took about, I would say,
time wise, if I consolidated
01:20 - it, it would have taken a month.
01:22 - And I also went on vacation,
and when I got back, I was
01:25 - sick for two weeks as well.
01:27 - But that still doesn't account
for the three month delay.
01:31 - I think that if I am truly honest
with myself, the truth is, there
01:36 - was probably a lot of fear on
my part which caused the delay.
01:40 - I kept Prioritizing my
other work over this app.
01:45 - And I think I was fearful
of getting rejected.
01:50 - I was fearful that this wouldn't work.
01:53 - I was fearful that I wouldn't
get users and wouldn't get
01:57 - downloads and things like that.
01:58 - And so inaction and by prioritizing other
work, I would just, it's avoidance, right?
02:05 - It's fear of failure.
02:06 - So, what's funny is that When we
submitted this app, it passed App
02:12 - Store review on the first try.
02:13 - So in retrospect, there wasn't
anything to be afraid of
02:16 - And so that's why I want to share with
you, you know looking back I think
02:20 - what I would have done differently
just to get to this point Bear in mind.
02:23 - This is just the beginning of the
journey because the app hasn't
02:26 - been even released This is not
the end of the journey publishing
02:30 - the app Is really the first step?
02:33 - And it took us so long To be exact,
if you look back on vlog number
02:38 - one of this series, I think it
was probably about a year ago.
02:43 - And to me, that's really embarrassing,
actually, because, I teach
02:49 - iOS I educate people and bring
beginners into the coding world.
02:54 - And really, it's taken us a
year to build something, which I
02:58 - don't think is that complicated.
03:00 - It's not because of, coding or anything.
03:02 - It's just.
03:04 - Priorities and fear.
03:05 - I think it still boils down to fear.
03:07 - So if I look back on it, what
would I have done differently?
03:11 - Let me bring some visuals so you're
not just staring at me talking So
03:18 - in the beginning this was something
that I really believed in I had done
03:23 - a little bit of keyword research.
03:25 - The plan was to do organic ASO
and get downloads that way.
03:29 - So I identified a few keywords and this
was something that I wanted to use myself.
03:34 - But, people change, times change.
03:36 - And I had already identified at that
point that momentum was really important.
03:40 - I knew that if the project
dragged on, I would lose interest.
03:44 - My priorities would become different.
03:47 - If you work on something, it's going to be
much more effective if it's something that
03:52 - you believe in so you have that momentum
and that motivation to get it done,
03:56 - pretty quickly, so that's number one.
03:59 - Number two is that although I did some
keyword research, I, I didn't do user
04:05 - research to make sure that this is
something that people really needed.
04:11 - Alright, and that's okay if
you don't take a year to do it.
04:15 - My next point is that to get over fear
of rejection, You should probably, this
04:20 - is what I'm going to try to do now, is
to build a handful of app ideas, like
04:27 - simple ones, really quickly and release
them and not care about the result,
04:31 - not care about trying to get users,
these are just like practice runs and
04:36 - getting used to that cycle of releasing
Just submitting and releasing, right?
04:41 - Get over that fear of doing that.
04:44 - So if this were the case where
I would build this in, a month,
04:47 - submit it and treat it as practice
for learning purposes, that
04:51 - would have been fine, right?
04:53 - But not not taking a year to do
this, another thing you can use
04:57 - to get over fear of failure is
to just assume you're gonna fail.
05:02 - So at some point for me to submit this
app, I was, I got into my head that I'm,
05:08 - it's just gonna get rejected, right?
05:10 - So in order to move forward, I
would have to submit it, right?
05:14 - And.
05:16 - If you think you're going to fail
anyways there's going to be less pressure
05:19 - and you're just going to hit submit.
05:21 - I had to get that into
my head at one point.
05:24 - And I think in the  next app
idea, I'm going to do more.
05:28 - Okay.
05:28 - Market research first and come up with
my marketing plan first because now at
05:33 - this point when I'm about to release
this app Now I'm starting to think
05:37 - about, okay how am I going to get users?
05:39 - And I think it's a little late despite
me knowing this from the beginning
05:44 - and saying this, so easy to just be
like, ah, you know what, it'll be fine.
05:48 - It'll be fine.
05:49 - And then, you just start moving forward.
05:51 - So that was what I did with this app.
05:54 - But now I feel like such
a big question mark.
05:59 - about getting users and how am I going
to market do this and just starting to
06:02 - think about this now that I can't believe
I took all of this time while the team
06:07 - and I right to get this to the point of
launching and then feeling okay now we
06:12 - have an even bigger wall to  get over yeah
because this is where the journey really
06:18 - starts I think the last lesson that I
have  is to build something you believe in
06:23 - because if that were the case Despite me
not having a marketing plan despite me not
06:27 - getting downloads despite me not getting
users it wouldn't really matter because
06:31 - If it's something that I believe in it's
something I want to use and something I
06:34 - need myself Then I would be really happy
just having this complete and being able
06:39 - to improve my own life with it so to sum
it up the lessons that i've learned Up
06:45 - to this point is that you should do more
market research first like You can go
06:52 - into reddit or you can go into whatsapp or
forum groups And just talk to more people
06:58 - you don't even have to like actually
talk to people if that's not your thing.
07:02 - You can post messages Just make sure that
what you're building like find a gap right
07:07 - between what's available today versus Um
what people need and what people want.
07:14 - Second thing is to get a few apps under
your belt without caring about the result.
07:19 - Just to get over that fear of
rejection because I think by the fifth
07:23 - app that you're publishing you're
going to be like, okay, I know this
07:26 - process inside and out, submitting
the app, filling out the metadata,
07:30 - privacy manifest, all of this stuff.
07:32 - It becomes really easy.
07:33 - Then you can focus on the execution of
the idea rather than all of this process.
07:39 - The third thing is to assume that you're
going to get rejected and that's helped
07:45 - me just submit it, 80 percent expecting to
just get rejected and have to resubmit it
07:50 - like because there's so many guidelines.
07:54 - I was afraid that I would get caught
up in some little thing that I didn't
07:57 - notice or something that I'd missed I
assume that would have been the case
08:00 - and we just have to fix it and resubmit
it Even if you do get rejected, it's
08:03 - really not the end of the world.
08:05 - They tell you what's wrong You
fix it and you resubmit it, right?
08:07 - So I'm not sure why I was so hung up
and Then next thing is have a marketing
08:13 - plan And last thing is to build
something that you would use yourself
08:18 - and that you're excited to bring into
reality so that you have the momentum
08:23 - to really get this done quickly.
08:26 - I hope that was helpful, but let's
click on this button together.
08:32 - I just picked all the countries
and just release this version.
08:37 - Okay, it's done.
08:38 - I will put the link to this app in the
description below so you can go and
08:43 - check it out Please give it a rating.
08:45 - Any rating is great.
08:47 - Any review is great Even if it's just
to say hi because it's the ratings
08:51 - and reviews that will help this app
out If you go into the settings tab
08:56 - there will be a button to rate this app
08:58 - After this, I'm going to formulate
a marketing plan and strategy for
09:02 - this app, so that will probably
be what the next vlog is about.
09:05 - I'm also going to create some
content about the submission
09:09 - process, about ASO, the things I've
learned, App Store Optimization
09:13 - Keywords and things like that.
09:14 - Alright, thanks for watching, and
I'll catch you in the next vlog.
