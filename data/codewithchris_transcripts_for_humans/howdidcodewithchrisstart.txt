00:01 - [Music]
00:03 - so it was a little bit of an accident
00:06 - really I remember this was back in
00:08 - January of 2013 I was working at a
00:12 - software consulting company where we
00:14 - built apps and web apps and software for
00:17 - clients and for that year our CTO said
00:20 - has a mandate to all developers a
00:23 - company you should get involved in the
00:26 - community this year and for me being an
00:28 - introvert that was kind of a problem
00:30 - didn't really want to talk to anyone and
00:32 - so I decided I was gonna create a blog
00:35 - and I was going to write my lessons
00:37 - learned and I was gonna create a YouTube
00:39 - channel where I would teach iOS
00:42 - development because that was what I was
00:44 - doing and I wasn't intending to show my
00:46 - face even so I remember recording those
00:49 - first few YouTube videos were really
00:51 - really rough and I really took so many
00:55 - takes to do it I hated the sound of my
00:58 - voice and then I didn't even show my
01:01 - face for the first bit and those videos
01:03 - are still up so you can actually check
01:06 - them out if you scroll all the way to
01:07 - like my first videos I was so monotonous
01:10 - so boring in my opinion but then I just
01:14 - kept at it you know I got better and
01:16 - better got more comfortable with myself
01:18 - and I started getting feedback from
01:21 - people you know that they were using my
01:23 - material and they were learning and they
01:26 - were really able to get value out of it
01:29 - and that made me so happy I didn't even
01:32 - intend for there to be any audience
01:34 - really I started the blog and the
01:36 - YouTube channel because of what our CTO
01:40 - said and for the reasons that I wanted
01:43 - to climb and better my career at the job
01:46 - that was the reason I started all of
01:48 - this but just seeing people read my
01:53 - articles and watch my videos and give me
01:55 - that good feedback that it was helping
01:57 - them it gave me so much satisfaction
01:59 - more satisfaction than building apps at
02:02 - getting building after the clients for
02:04 - the consulting companies and getting
02:06 - props from my boss or whatever
02:08 - you know so it was so good
02:13 - like I like helping people in that way
02:16 - so much that I wanted really to make it
02:18 - a full-time job if I could and at that
02:22 - time I was making a bit of an ad revenue
02:24 - from YouTube something like eight
02:26 - dollars a day and I was like if I
02:28 - produce more videos then I should make
02:30 - more ad revenue and pretty soon that
02:34 - could be a full-time income and so that
02:36 - was my plans produce more videos make
02:38 - more ad revenue quit my job and do this
02:41 - full-time because I love it that didn't
02:45 - really work out because the ad revenue
02:47 - if fluctuates you have you have videos
02:50 - which which you know are hits in some
02:52 - heart and I think at my highest point I
02:55 - was like at $15 a day but you know
02:58 - really it really wasn't working out and
03:00 - I had actually taken a sabbatical to
03:03 - think about that and I was on such good
03:05 - terms with a boss that he let me take
03:07 - two months off just to relax after a bad
03:10 - project and after a tough project and I
03:13 - I told him I really really needed this
03:14 - time off just to figure out reset myself
03:18 - figure out what I wanted to do and yeah
03:23 - that's what I did so for two months I I
03:25 - just relaxed and I worked on my
03:28 - youtube-channel worked on my blog and I
03:31 - only got it up to like 15 dollars a day
03:33 - and that wasn't enough to quit my job I
03:36 - went back to work I refocused myself on
03:38 - my career and I was gonna climb my
03:41 - career that was my that was I realized
03:44 - my self with those goals and then I hit
03:47 - this bad project a little later on so I
03:50 - hit a hit a bad project and there were
03:52 - bad projects before but this one was
03:54 - particularly bad it was during the last
03:56 - two weeks of the project that's always
03:58 - crunch time trying to wrap up all the
04:00 - bugs trying to ship the product to the
04:02 - client and you can expect some late
04:04 - nights but that night was particularly
04:06 - bad it was like the straw that broke the
04:08 - camel's back and we we had left office
04:11 - at like 3:00 a.m. and parking lots empty
04:14 - you're driving home snow cars on the
04:17 - road and then we had to come in the next
04:19 - day I like 9:30 a.m.
04:21 - and I remember sitting back down at my
04:23 - desk in the morning
04:25 - my back was hurting and I could barely
04:27 - keep my eyes open they were hurting and
04:29 - I was just thinking about wow if I
04:32 - retired at 65 how many more years do I
04:34 - have to work you know and it if I can't
04:40 - keep this out my body my body wouldn't
04:42 - be able to keep this up and my health is
04:43 - more important than anything else
04:45 - and so you know and in the satisfaction
04:49 - that I got from my youtube channel and
04:52 - listening to how I was helping people
04:54 - that you know that was that was the
05:01 - greatest thing I didn't get any more
05:03 - satisfaction from anything else than
05:05 - that and I really really wanted to make
05:07 - that my full-time job so what I did was
05:10 - I quit my job and I gave myself eight
05:14 - months to try and make it full time he
05:16 - come and I thought if I can't make it
05:17 - work I can always look for a new job
05:19 - because the job market was pretty good
05:20 - for iOS developers that wasn't really
05:23 - that afraid of that but the thing is at
05:27 - that point of time I was married and I
05:29 - had my wife and we're thinking about
05:30 - having kids and we were thinking about
05:32 - buying a house so there's all these like
05:34 - big expenses and big life milestones
05:37 - coming up and so it was kind of scary in
05:40 - that regard
05:41 - my wife continued working she was so
05:43 - supportive of me to try to do this and I
05:48 - realized that in eight months time I was
05:53 - able to produce a course actually how I
05:56 - arrived that producing course was
05:58 - actually you guys I have such a
06:00 - supportive audience and I just asked you
06:02 - guys if I created a product or a course
06:04 - that was paid would you guys purchase it
06:06 - and enough people said yes that it gave
06:08 - me the confidence to go ahead and spend
06:10 - that time to produce it and so I made my
06:12 - first course it was on objective-c
06:14 - teaching complete beginners I was app
06:17 - development and from then that point on
06:21 - I've just continued updating that course
06:23 - when Swift came out and converted it to
06:25 - Swift and that's really been my main
06:29 - income asset for all this time right
06:33 - that it's 2019 now that was 2013 so I'm
06:37 - so thankful that I've been able to do
06:40 - this full time and live my dream teach
06:44 - you guys and I'm so satisfied every day
06:47 - to hear about all the accomplishments
06:49 - and all of the people who are learning
06:51 - Iowa's app development for me so it's
06:53 - all thanks to your support you're
06:56 - watching my videos and you're reading my
06:58 - articles and yeah that's how code with
07:02 - Chris started never that I think that it
07:04 - would turn into what it is and now my
07:06 - wife she's working on code with Chris as
07:09 - well so we have three people we have my
07:11 - wife myself and we have Adrian who edits
07:14 - all the videos and and talks with you
07:16 - guys in the community and the YouTube
07:17 - comments so it's so awesome it's so
07:19 - awesome
07:20 - and I'm also so excited for what's to
07:22 - come because I feel like we're just
07:23 - getting started as code with Chris's
07:25 - starting to mature a little bit and
07:27 - starting to become a little bit more of
07:29 - a real company we're gonna be able to
07:33 - produce higher-quality stuff we're gonna
07:35 - be able to produce more stuff and be in
07:37 - more places and get more exposure and
07:39 - all that stuff I can't wait but in the
07:42 - end all it really comes down to is the
07:45 - ability to affect more lives right and
07:49 - I've come to realize that at first when
07:51 - Cola Chris started it was really you
07:54 - know you could say that it was for
07:55 - selfish reasons right I wanted to I
07:57 - wanted to be able to do this full-time
08:00 - and it made me really happy right those
08:02 - are me reasons but later on as I as I
08:06 - did it through the years the reasons
08:08 - kind of morphed and I realized that I
08:10 - was touching people's lives and I was
08:12 - affecting people's lives I was helping
08:14 - people a lot of people who are
08:16 - completely not coders coming to the
08:19 - coding world get jobs changed the
08:21 - directions of the careers or people you
08:23 - know decide that they want to go into
08:25 - this for school things like that
08:29 - I saw affecting people's lives that
08:30 - really ultimately that is my mission now
08:33 - to build up this platform and so I can
08:38 - reach more and more people and
08:40 - more lives change more lives and you

08:54 - this I can't thank you guys enough for
