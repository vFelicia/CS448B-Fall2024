With timestamps:

00:00 - there were so many cool announcements at
00:01 - this year's WWDC 23 and one of the big
00:05 - ones obviously was Vision Pro but to be
00:08 - honest it's my least impactful
00:10 - announcement for the entire event now
00:11 - let me tell you why Vision Pro is
00:13 - Apple's new device for spatial Computing
00:16 - and that brings to us a new platform
00:18 - Vision OS for developers like us to
00:21 - build apps on it's a cool technology but
00:23 - at 3 500 U.S only Rich new adopters are
00:27 - going to have one and I'm a practical
00:30 - guy I'm not going to be spending my time
00:32 - and effort into building apps for a
00:34 - limited group of people on a fledgling
00:36 - new platform but that's just me if
00:39 - you've already been knee-deep into AR
00:41 - kit reality kit and you've been honing
00:43 - your skills in 3D this is a huge
00:45 - opportunity for you to be first to
00:47 - Market with a cool new app for this
00:49 - Vision platform OS and think about the
00:52 - early days of the iPhone when it was
00:54 - just released some of the most popular
00:56 - apps for the iPhone was also some of the
00:58 - most useless ones that's is why Vision
01:00 - OS is one of the least impactful ones
01:02 - for me next up Swift macros Swift macros
01:06 - help you code Faster by letting you
01:08 - annotate your code for common patterns
01:11 - and coding instead of typing the whole
01:13 - thing out and the other cool thing is
01:14 - that you can create your own macros and
01:16 - share them with other developers through
01:18 - Swift packages now this is one
01:20 - Improvement that is going to make your
01:21 - life better every single day no matter
01:24 - what Apple platform you're developing on
01:26 - and I think that is awesome however one
01:29 - downside that I can see is that this is
01:31 - going to make reading Swift Code even
01:33 - more cryptic for beginners who are
01:34 - learning for the first time because now
01:37 - there is code that's hidden behind
01:39 - macros and if they don't know that it's
01:41 - not really going to make sense to them
01:42 - next I want to talk about Swift data now
01:45 - Swift data is the new core data
01:47 - following the easy to use Swift UI
01:49 - principles now this is great news for
01:51 - people who are building apps that need
01:53 - local data persistence but let's be
01:55 - honest not every single app you build is
01:57 - going to need local data persistence to
01:59 - this level perhaps app storage is enough
02:03 - for what your app is trying to do and
02:05 - that's why Swift data is only impactful
02:07 - if you are building an app that can
02:09 - utilize it but this next announcement is
02:13 - impactful for every single app developer
02:15 - improved Swift UI animations now why are
02:18 - animations such a big deal because it
02:20 - improves the perceived quality of your
02:22 - app as long as it's done in a thoughtful
02:24 - way and then these days when competition
02:26 - is so high your app needs to look good
02:29 - and feel good if you want your users to
02:31 - continue to launch it and use it that's
02:33 - why I love that they're giving us more
02:34 - control over animations through
02:36 - keyframing and animation phases and
02:38 - they're also making them easier for us
02:40 - to use through the spring modifier and
02:43 - animated SF symbols any app will benefit
02:45 - from this Improvement and that's why it
02:48 - is my second top impactful announcement
02:50 - of WWDC now this next one is I think the
02:55 - most impactful announcement made widget
02:57 - interactivity and transitions in the
03:00 - last WDC I noticed that one of the
03:02 - biggest themes was how your app lives
03:05 - outside of your app through glanceable
03:07 - widgets on the lock screen and app
03:09 - intense this year that is even more true
03:12 - with Widget interactivity most apps can
03:15 - benefit from a widget because it allows
03:17 - the user another way to ReDiscover your
03:19 - app now with interactive widgets you
03:22 - might be able to include the core
03:23 - functionality of your app through a
03:25 - widget because of this we actually might
03:28 - see a change in user behavior in iOS 17
03:31 - and Beyond widgets may become the
03:35 - preferred way to interact with apps and
03:37 - maybe launching apps will feel old
03:39 - clunky and archaic so definitely see if
03:43 - interactive widgets is something that
03:45 - makes sense for your app now please drop
03:47 - me a comment below and let me know what
03:49 - your favorite announcement is also let
03:51 - me know if you agree or disagree with my
03:54 - rankings lastly if you're looking to
03:55 - join CWC plus we're running a WWDC sale
03:58 - over at code with Chris dot com I'll be
04:01 - diving deeper into all these topics in
04:02 - the coming week so stay tuned thanks for
04:04 - watching I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

there were so many cool announcements at this year's WWDC 23 and one of the big ones obviously was Vision Pro but to be honest it's my least impactful announcement for the entire event now let me tell you why Vision Pro is Apple's new device for spatial Computing and that brings to us a new platform Vision OS for developers like us to build apps on it's a cool technology but at 3 500 U.S only Rich new adopters are going to have one and I'm a practical guy I'm not going to be spending my time and effort into building apps for a limited group of people on a fledgling new platform but that's just me if you've already been kneedeep into AR kit reality kit and you've been honing your skills in 3D this is a huge opportunity for you to be first to Market with a cool new app for this Vision platform OS and think about the early days of the iPhone when it was just released some of the most popular apps for the iPhone was also some of the most useless ones that's is why Vision OS is one of the least impactful ones for me next up Swift macros Swift macros help you code Faster by letting you annotate your code for common patterns and coding instead of typing the whole thing out and the other cool thing is that you can create your own macros and share them with other developers through Swift packages now this is one Improvement that is going to make your life better every single day no matter what Apple platform you're developing on and I think that is awesome however one downside that I can see is that this is going to make reading Swift Code even more cryptic for beginners who are learning for the first time because now there is code that's hidden behind macros and if they don't know that it's not really going to make sense to them next I want to talk about Swift data now Swift data is the new core data following the easy to use Swift UI principles now this is great news for people who are building apps that need local data persistence but let's be honest not every single app you build is going to need local data persistence to this level perhaps app storage is enough for what your app is trying to do and that's why Swift data is only impactful if you are building an app that can utilize it but this next announcement is impactful for every single app developer improved Swift UI animations now why are animations such a big deal because it improves the perceived quality of your app as long as it's done in a thoughtful way and then these days when competition is so high your app needs to look good and feel good if you want your users to continue to launch it and use it that's why I love that they're giving us more control over animations through keyframing and animation phases and they're also making them easier for us to use through the spring modifier and animated SF symbols any app will benefit from this Improvement and that's why it is my second top impactful announcement of WWDC now this next one is I think the most impactful announcement made widget interactivity and transitions in the last WDC I noticed that one of the biggest themes was how your app lives outside of your app through glanceable widgets on the lock screen and app intense this year that is even more true with Widget interactivity most apps can benefit from a widget because it allows the user another way to ReDiscover your app now with interactive widgets you might be able to include the core functionality of your app through a widget because of this we actually might see a change in user behavior in iOS 17 and Beyond widgets may become the preferred way to interact with apps and maybe launching apps will feel old clunky and archaic so definitely see if interactive widgets is something that makes sense for your app now please drop me a comment below and let me know what your favorite announcement is also let me know if you agree or disagree with my rankings lastly if you're looking to join CWC plus we're running a WWDC sale over at code with Chris dot com I'll be diving deeper into all these topics in the coming week so stay tuned thanks for watching I'll see you next time
