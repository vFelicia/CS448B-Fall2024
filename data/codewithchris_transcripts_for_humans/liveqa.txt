00:02 - hey guys can you hear can you hear me
and can see me I can't see how many
00:16 - people oh there we are there's seven
people on hey guys what's up it's been a
00:23 - long time since I've done one of these
live streams and even back then I was
00:27 - doing more of like presentation style so
you guys would see slides and I would
00:32 - have like a prepared presentation but I
just wanted to hang out with you guys
00:38 - and also I haven't done the war card
game in Xcode 10 yet so I wanted to just
00:45 - do it with you it shouldn't be too hard
I think I think it's gonna take 20
00:50 - minutes to be honest and the rest of the
time I'll just be chatting with you guys
00:54 - and hang out and answering some
questions if I can
01:00 - Wow with 36 people on that's crazy
because I didn't heavily promote this
01:06 - livestream because it's pretty much my
first one probably this year in like ten
01:12 - months and so I didn't want to make a
fool out of myself in front of all you
01:17 - guys so 36 people so far hey guys I also
want to mention that Adrienne is in the
01:24 - chat so he'll be helping answering some
questions if he knows the answers and
01:29 - also pointing you guys to existing
resources we have a code address and if
01:35 - you guys haven't met Adrienne yet he's
actually done some of the videos on the
01:39 - channel and he does all the video
editing and he also helps out a lot in
01:43 - the community actually he pretty much
handled all of it in like the Facebook
01:47 - groups that we have maybe Adrienne you
can post the links to the Facebook
01:54 - groups in case some of these guys are
not on it and we usually hang out in the
01:59 - Facebook communities as well and we we
help a lot of students with the problems
02:05 - even if they're not learning with code
with Chris type articles and they're
02:10 - learning with other articles we still
try to help people out
02:13 - we can and then everyone actually helps
each other out so it's a really good
02:16 - place to be
hey guys alright so I'm gonna get
02:24 - started right away we're gonna launch
Xcode 10 and NES turn right away and
02:30 - it's gonna be recorded so for people who
are just gonna come late you guys can
02:35 - always catch up in the recording
actually hey this is my first one I
02:40 - gotta share my screen can I do that oh
please say I can share my screen is a
03:08 - huge fail on my part and find a button
to share my screen and if we can't
03:20 - actually do this if we can't share my
screen and I can't show this then we're
03:24 - just going to do a question-answering
session but I think it'd be fairly
03:30 - stupid if I couldn't actually share my
screen good point sir
03:55 - can point the camera to my screen let me
try and figure this out there like no
04:00 - buttons on on this interface here for me
to do this all right you know what I'm
04:08 - gonna just point the camera to my screen
let's see how it looks it might it might
04:12 - actually look pretty bad
04:16 - next week we'll do better guys okay guys
this is really not ideal I wonder how it
05:08 - looks
watch the they launch the screen on my
05:14 - laptop so I can see what you guys are
seeing
06:15 - okay guys I think this might be as good
as we're gonna get no good yeah you guys
06:42 - can't see anything you know what I'm
just gonna record doing it next pretend
06:47 - as a separate video and in this
livestream I'm just gonna hang out with
06:50 - you guys and I'm just going to answer
questions and stuff
06:53 - I'll go through the chat if you guys
google and you guys can find out how to
06:59 - share your screen through a YouTube
livestream because they're honestly seen
07:02 - no buttons on the screen for me to do
this
07:06 - it seems really stupid and odd to me I
don't think that's right I think I'm
07:10 - just missing something actually alright
it's gonna hang with you guys that was
07:21 - really the main point I wanted to do a
live stream anyways I mean I could have
07:25 - recorded a video to do an Xcode 10 or
card game tutorial at any point in time
07:32 - so alright let's just scroll through the
chat and let's answer some questions
07:45 - okay so Jetson asks which design pattern
to use and to be honest I haven't
07:54 - developed like professional apps in a
long time back when I was in software
07:59 - consulting you just used MVC I think
back then they didn't have a lot of the
08:04 - newer patterns that I'm hearing about
these days like VIPRE and bbm and stuff
08:09 - like that yeah so those are it was that
you're mentioning too and so to be
08:13 - honest the the type of stuff that I've
been building has
08:17 - a bit like small demos and so it hasn't
really mattered that much so I've still
08:23 - been using MBC but if you were building
like enterprise type of application then
08:31 - that I'm sure you can consider the other
types of design patterns and I'm not too
08:36 - familiar with them unfortunately I thank
you tech with Jarvis um do you know what
08:47 - building a list asks do you know about
building an app with JavaScript because
08:51 - that's what I want to use to build an
app you can definitely do that because I
08:55 - think it was PhoneGap and some of the
other third-party frameworks that you
09:00 - can use to build iOS apps with I think
PhoneGap uses JavaScript if other people
09:07 - know please help Liz out and just let
her know and they're like you can use
09:13 - react native you can use what's that
other one with c-sharp that is just
09:21 - escapes me right now but you can there's
a whole bunch of ways to build iOS apps
09:25 - well like the Apple endorsed recommended
way is of course to buy like a Mac and
09:29 - use Xcode and to go through those types
of things
09:38 - okay so Kay that's right react native
electron actually if I haven't heard of
09:44 - that framework before
09:54 - yes Steve I know execute and works fine
with the work our game app but a lot of
09:59 - my videos they show like the object
library in the lower right hand corner
10:02 - and so I think for a lot of beginners
who are just trying to find that object
10:07 - library they're gonna be super confused
in Xcode 10 and so that's why I thought
10:11 - it'd be a good idea to show how to do it
but I'm glad that Mexico tendon break a
10:18 - whole bunch of stuff because I don't
know what like Auto layout first came
10:21 - out and back I'm like Xcode three four
five those days were the roughest
10:26 - because every single year I had to read
you everything how things changed so
10:31 - much but now that's now that's a lot
better
10:34 - Oh Jacob thanks okay so I need I need
some sort of a third-party software I'm
10:42 - so sorry guys this is like my first time
doing this
10:45 - and I really wanted to to do that but I
guess that up next time next week around
10:53 - this time we'll do a livestream again
I'll show you guys something else I
10:56 - don't think we're gonna do the work art
game in Xcode ten we'll probably do
11:00 - something else
11:05 - Jonathan Kim you prefer storyboard or
all and eco would actually have a funny
11:10 - story about this that I've been meaning
to turn into a video and I just haven't
11:16 - gotten around to it because I know if
you guys are familiar Bryan moon who's
11:20 - also on YouTube he's a big proponent of
using code only programmatic creating UI
11:27 - elements and just building the UI
through code and I've been mostly
11:32 - showing people how to do stuff through
storyboards so here's the story back
11:36 - then when I was still working in
software consulting when we build Iowa's
11:41 - out it was honestly all code and we
didn't use storyboards at all and I
11:47 - remember there was this one guy who we
hired his name was Kia Bosch and I don't
11:54 - think he's watching so I think talking
about but anyways he was self-taught and
11:59 - he came into our company and he used
storyboards so he was a big proponent of
12:03 - storyboards
12:06 - and we we didn't make fun of him but we
basically said you know like that's
12:12 - that's not the way to go right you have
to use code to generate the UI it's just
12:16 - so much easier in terms of when you're
working in a team and everyone's like
12:20 - committing code and sometimes you get
conflicts because people are trying to
12:24 - change the same thing and once you get
used to reading code to to like generate
12:32 - those elements and put them up into the
view it's not that hard to see what's
12:36 - happening looking at different lines of
code and imagining like in your head you
12:40 - kind of understand how things are how
the UI will look so merging code and
12:46 - resolving conflicts via code was much
easier than trying to merge and resolve
12:55 - conflicts be a storyboard so if like two
developers changed something in the
12:59 - story word and they committed the the
storyboard it's actually just this big
13:03 - XML file and trying to figure out what
the columns like this was a headache for
13:09 - us and so that's one of the reasons why
we went all code and to be honest it is
13:16 - faster than storyboard so once I left
the company and I started teaching how
13:22 - to build apps online I realized that
teaching beginners who have never coded
13:29 - before how to build UI through code is
is tough right it makes people want to
13:35 - quit and so I started looking into
storyboards I started using them as a
13:39 - teaching tool and it was good I started
seeing like the good side of using
13:44 - storyboards right from a teaching
perspective it's amazing right for for
13:49 - someone who's just a beginner who comes
in and they can see oh I can build my UI
13:53 - like this I understand how a stack view
works and all that stuff it's really it
14:00 - gets them excited right I guess them to
want to learn more and I feel like the
14:04 - natural progression is like eventually
as you get more experienced and then
14:09 - you're working you're working your way
into becoming like working at a
14:13 - professional company where you're doing
this for a living
14:17 - then by that point in time you will
probably just be so familiar with
14:23 - building UI through code anyways but
starting out I do recommend that you use
14:27 - tor more than Apple does do and their
beginner walkthroughs and tutorials they
14:31 - always like use the storyboard so that I
hope that answers her question I guess
14:38 - it kind of doesn't personally now so at
this point in time if I were to build my
14:44 - personal app I've gotten so used to
doing just like using the storyboard
14:51 - that I think I would do like a hybrid
approach so if there are elements on the
14:58 - screen that are kind of like permanent
and stationary I would just put those
15:02 - elements into the storyboard but then
for like dynamic elements if I'm like
15:07 - pulling data through a feed and
generating like little cards or news
15:11 - articles or whatever I might use code to
generate those and then put them into
15:16 - the view so kind of like a hybrid
approach to anything um Shawn Shawn
15:23 - Allen did some sort of video where he he
gave it a name I forgot what he called
15:28 - it like was it the skeleton approach or
something like that
15:30 - and I think that's kind of what he does
as well
15:37 - exponents with that developer guy asks
Xcode and sua seems more complicated
15:43 - than say learning Python or JavaScript
do you have any advice for wading
15:48 - through the high learning curve hmm well
I will say like Xcode itself yeah it
15:56 - does take a little bit of learning to
understand where things are and how to
16:01 - use it
Swift itself as a language I don't know
16:05 - if I agree with you that it's more
complicated than Python but I think with
16:13 - with Python you might just have less to
learn in the sense that you don't need
16:18 - that IDE for advice there's so many
beginner resources out there for Xcode
16:28 - and Swift I
think it's just as with anything like
16:32 - the more you're in Xcode the more you're
like writing code the more familiar it's
16:38 - going to get so I think a lot of people
tell me if I'm wrong guys a lot of
16:43 - people you know they watch videos or
they read books but then when it comes
16:48 - to actually starting to code that's
another story right it's a little
16:53 - tougher to to start doing that and
making mistakes because some of you guys
16:58 - may have heard but my own story for
learning iOS I failed that way too like
17:03 - I read a book front to back and keep in
mind like I knew other programming
17:08 - languages so I'm coming from a
programming background right now reading
17:12 - this book on objective-c and Xcode and
everything makes sense as I'm going
17:17 - through it I'm like just banging through
it and like yes this all makes sense
17:21 - that I'm going to be able to create this
app but then by the end of the book when
17:25 - I just started launch the Xcode and I
tried to build the project I realized
17:29 - that I forgot a lot of also what I read
so my recommendation is don't consume
17:36 - too much content just consume like that
first lesson are the first two lessons
17:42 - and then practice get on keyboard make
mistakes try it out because that's what
17:48 - helps gets it sinking into your brain
and then go on you know don't watch
17:55 - everything and then try to build enough
after that the C Steve asks can you make
18:04 - a tutorial of sprite kit Xcode so sprite
kit has been something that's been on my
18:09 - mind a lot because what got me into
programming in the first place was
18:15 - building games and back then and as part
of high school they had a computer
18:20 - programming class and in that class we
used Turing which is a language I don't
18:25 - think is a lot of people heard of before
but just the fact that I could type some
18:30 - code on the screen and create like a
square give it a color make it move
18:34 - around that was so cool to me and I I
was trying to create stuff that was
18:40 - pretty complicated like chess
trying to draw the little like horsemen
18:45 - with these like shapes and stuff like
that but it was just so much fun I was
18:49 - just doing in my spare time so going
back to like gaming building games and
18:57 - stuff like that it's something that I
definitely want to do a cover sprite kit
19:02 - I mean and sprite kit seems like such a
natural progression from teaching app
19:08 - development already but personally if I
were really serious about building games
19:14 - I would probably invest my time into
learning unity that's just for the fact
19:23 - that um that's what the standard is
right for industry like industry
19:27 - standard but I think for sprite kit it's
kind of the natural the natural next
19:33 - step for me if I were wanting to start
teaching a little bit of game
19:40 - development and I have the thing that
excites me about that too is that I have
19:45 - a lot to learn because there's so many
disciplines with a game development like
19:48 - you need to know how to draw right you
need art you need sound like music and
19:54 - there's so many different disciplines to
building a game versus building an app
19:58 - but Billy not be still you know you need
the design aspect you need like the the
20:05 - user experience aspect but I feel like
as a developer on some of those things
20:10 - you can you can I won't say fake but you
can kind of learn over time like you
20:16 - don't have to be an expert designer and
you can still create something that
20:20 - looks pretty good
you don't have to be you know an expert
20:23 - and usability but just by using apps
yourself you can still understand what's
20:29 - a no-no right and what what's a good
usable design but with game development
20:35 - I mean if you're not a sound composer
and you don't have any musical ability
20:39 - it's it's hard to create a soundtrack
for your game and I know actually a lot
20:44 - of those things you can by liking about
my soundtracks you can buy art for your
20:48 - game and stuff like that and that's a
lot easier to buy honestly than buying
20:53 - assets for an app
let's say no yes it says if you guys
21:06 - notice that the pooh bear cub you don't
judge it's actually his cup is really
21:11 - old actually this cup was my
girlfriend's cut back then but now my
21:18 - wife and she somehow hates it now and so
I use it I like it because it's a big
21:23 - mug all right what have we got here
I see some links for the livestream
21:35 - computer screen so take a look at those
Thank You Kate I'll take a look at those
21:39 - after I can't believe I'm so unprepared
21:47 - use Alamo fire or any other Pods or do
you create all your elements like in the
21:53 - videos I don't understand the second
part of your question do you create all
21:59 - of your elements like in the videos but
in regards to alamo fire i did i do i
22:08 - mean i did created a video for that too
and maybe it i won't i won't go and look
22:15 - for it now but if you go into my channel
and then i don't know for the search
22:19 - feature but if you go back like in 2017
i think or maybe even 2016 i did a video
22:25 - for that johnson storyboard or nip file
a storyboard i don't use no files too
22:37 - much but they're pretty much the same
thing what is your process from moving
22:43 - from static mock-ups and prototypes into
dev sketch envision to xcode oh this is
22:50 - a cool question martin because actually
I just finished the design course and
22:56 - not where I'm teaching like design
theory and because I'm not an expert in
22:59 - design but the course was more about
what you're asking here so like how do
23:04 - we design something in sketch
or envision and then how do you like
23:10 - take those elements out and then how do
you integrate them into Xcode so I will
23:16 - show you guys through the YouTube
channel parts of doing that over time
23:23 - because my plan for the channel is to
build apps together and so you're gonna
23:27 - be seeing that end-to-end process so
this is a little like preview for next
23:32 - week or a couple of weeks later where I
will be coming up with an idea with you
23:39 - guys I have a couple ideas and then we
will together be flushing the idea out
23:45 - and turning into wireframes and then
going through the design process and
23:50 - then building it out the next foot
integrating those graphics and stuff
23:53 - like that so I think that not many
people are doing that on YouTube and I
23:58 - feel like that would be the most helpful
thing right I'm cool with doing one-off
24:04 - tutorials and all of that but I feel
like the complete process would be
24:09 - amazing and I want to do this like once
a month
24:12 - so every month we can pump out an app
and we can publish it together actually
24:16 - want to publish it to the App Store
together I feel like it's ambitious I
24:23 - know but I think we can do it because
I'm not going to be trying to boil the
24:27 - ocean I'm not going to be trying to
create a super duper complicated out but
24:31 - anyways I've gone off on a tangent
Martin to answer your question yeah so
24:40 - it's designing the the app design and
sketch is one thing right and that takes
24:46 - a little bit of learning how to use
sketch for example or envision and
24:50 - having a little bit of that creativity I
think what really helps is looking at
24:55 - designs existing app designs on
Pinterest or dribble or stuff like that
25:01 - and then taking elements that you like
and try to recreate it and over time
25:06 - you're going to be able to have more
originality and more creativity but at
25:11 - first what you're like staring at a
blank canvas and you don't know what
25:14 - looks good my advice would just be to
look at other designs that you think
25:18 - look
in your opinion look good and try to
25:21 - recreate some of those elements pull
different elements that you like into
25:25 - your own design so once you've created
your app design the next step is not
25:31 - just to export everything every single
element as images because there are a
25:37 - lot of elements that you can style
programmatically encode and I would
25:42 - recommend to do that over loading up
images because that takes that's more of
25:47 - a performance hit so things like buttons
if they're just like solid colors with
25:52 - rounded corners and like a fancy font or
something like that that's all you can
25:55 - do through code so you don't need to
create an image graphic image for your
26:00 - button and then also the other
discipline or sorry the other knowledge
26:07 - that you need inside Xcode is how
different user interface elements work
26:12 - for example styling a button is very
different from like styling a table view
26:15 - header or a table view cell that's
different from styling like a slider or
26:23 - something like that and so through time
you will learn how to style these
26:29 - different elements and then it gets
easier and easier and easier and in
26:33 - terms of icons and stuff like that I
personally don't draw my own icons you
26:39 - can buy icon packs and stuff like that
so icons8.com as a service that I
26:44 - use for icons all right so let's ask if
you use a framework to build an app yeah
26:55 - you would you would own the app because
the framework is just like what it's
27:01 - built on but I want to make one
distinction because there are app
27:05 - services out there like I build out calm
I think is one of them and there are
27:10 - other services there are platforms out
there where you don't have to code
27:14 - anything and all you do is like select
different elements select what type of
27:18 - app you want and it's like a wizard that
just steps you through and then by the
27:23 - end of it you have now it's for people
who don't want to code and they don't
27:27 - really want to custom at and they just
want a pretty on no rails type of that
27:32 - and then you would have to be more
careful about that because I'm not sure
27:37 - if they own it or you own in or whatever
I think you have to pay like a monthly
27:41 - subscription fee for to keep it in the
App Store that's something you can look
27:45 - into but for you I think you were
talking about with JavaScript anyways
27:49 - right so it sounds like you want to code
your own out I'm glad you guys are
27:56 - answering chatting as well to Steve so
Swift code right now yeah you can use it
28:09 - on other platforms there are some
server-side platforms that you can use
28:14 - it online paper excuse me but I think
Swift is just right now still primarily
28:22 - used on iOS and I think there are some
some things people did on exploring
28:27 - using Swift on Android but I'm not too
sure about that because it after all it
28:33 - is open source Thank You Robin you're
awesome too how can I make an audio wave
28:46 - view while recording like the one on
Apple I know what you're talking about
28:50 - like when you're recording something and
there's like a little wave thing I'm not
28:56 - actually sure how to do that but try
Google I might look into that in the
29:02 - future maybe someone's done a tutorial
in it an idea
29:13 - ACV asks okay you guys are talking about
the machine so I'm gonna skip that
29:21 - question let's see what we've got
specs you know for in terms of machines
29:30 - I'm still using my laptop from let's see
I'll tell you what I have I have a
29:38 - MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch from early
2015 and it's 2.9 gigahertz Intel Core
29:49 - i5 with 16 gigs of ram and this machine
which is streaming right now this is my
29:55 - iMac also from mid-2015 3.3 gigahertz
Intel Core i5 with 32 gigs of ram so
30:06 - this stuff is still running fine I mean
I think the average lifespan until it
30:13 - gets like unbearably slow and you need
to upgrade would be 4 to 5 years and
30:17 - that's just an estimate though don't
don't hold me to that
30:23 - hey Haley awesome I'm glad you're
working on that match game a plan to
30:28 - release a lot more apt tutorials for you
guys I don't want to get too into it but
30:33 - I've been my family and I have been
dealing with a lot of like health issues
30:38 - so you know agents been helping keep
keep things moving around and on code
30:46 - with Chris but now thankfully to say
everything's good we're back now so I'm
30:51 - planning to publish a lot more content
for you guys and I'm really excited
30:56 - about that so as you can see I'm doing a
live stream which is something that I
30:59 - don't I don't usually do and I want to
do one of these like every week so I
31:03 - just so I can hang out with you guys and
chat I feel like you know it's been 5
31:09 - years since I've been doing code with
Chris it's hard to believe 5 years and
31:15 - usually like behind the camera when you
see me in the videos I do several takes
31:20 - and then sometimes not even like
scripted out because
31:24 - I don't do well on live and Here I am
right so uh I hope you guys aren't too
31:31 - hard on me but I feel like like with
anything the more more of these I do the
31:37 - better or more comfortable again that's
really the goal here I just want to be
31:41 - comfortable with you guys I don't you
know I'm not gonna let that stand in my
31:47 - way of interacting with you guys and
helping you guys build apps and learn
31:54 - how to live in one asks is there an
advantage to using the pin button to a
32:08 - site constraints versus dragging and
dropping the trains with the right mouse
32:11 - button
honestly the if you're more familiar
32:15 - it's faster to use the right mouse
button and just drag and drop the pin
32:22 - button is just when I do tutorials it's
easier to demonstrate that so that you
32:27 - know there's no extra hold down command
or like hold down control and then drag
32:33 - it and then hold down command to like
multi select it's a couple of things and
32:37 - and that's harder to show through the
screen and so when you watching my
32:40 - tutorials I'm always like clicking that
pin button to bring up that menu and
32:44 - it's visual right so you can see all of
these things that's a lot of users but
32:48 - once you get more familiar with it
I would just do whatever's faster for
32:52 - you there's no difference tend to your
question
33:02 - Mack many be good enough to develop apps
yes definitely still worth becoming an
33:09 - iOS engineer for a job I think so I plan
for one's gonna find me you guys are
33:14 - here right you guys are obviously
interested in building iOS apps try
33:18 - looking at job postings around your area
or glass door and stuff and I think it's
33:24 - still um still in demand but obviously I
think if you want like a bulletproof job
33:30 - yeah
platform I mean it's probably web
33:33 - development because that's probably
never gonna go away but to be honest
33:39 - with you in this industry and technology
you're always learning something new
33:44 - like iOS wasn't my first thing either
right I was I was doing ESP net I
33:50 - remember like web sites web apps with
asp.net and then I learned I excuse me
33:57 - I'm a little bit sick I even touched
into flash flex I did like the Microsoft
34:07 - came up with these big touch tables the
Microsoft Surface did that that was
34:11 - using like WPF so I you know as your
career evolves you're going to be
34:17 - learning all sorts of different
platforms technologies and so I don't
34:20 - think there's a bulletproof thing and
the thing is if you pigeonhole yourself
34:24 - and me like oh I I'm only gonna do iOS
and that's all I want to do which is
34:30 - great for when there are lots of work
for that right but you know when there
34:37 - comes to the time when there isn't then
then you're not going to be as flexible
34:43 - maybe and because because these
platforms they're always evolving and if
34:49 - you're not keeping up and you're not
learning new things along with it then
34:53 - you're kind of gonna be left in the dust
35:03 - Hassim asks you make any tutorial
without preparation to show us your
35:08 - process when making something new how to
think and use apple's documentation so
35:11 - if you missed it earlier i didn't
mention that we're going to be building
35:16 - apps the other buns on this channel so
we're gonna step through like the
35:21 - end-to-end process where we start off
with like i da ting and then coming up
35:24 - with your part minutes and and building
out the UI and stuff like that and i'll
35:29 - be doing it that through these live
streams that were you every week
35:33 - unfortunately there's only like four
weeks a month and i want to publish an
35:38 - app by the end of the month so i might
have to do some through videos but you
35:47 - guys will still be able to see a lot of
the process hi Ricky thanks Hayley
35:58 - can you tell me a good source for iowa's
interview questions to be honest I think
36:03 - Shaun Helens also on YouTube would be
good for that because he was actually
36:07 - going through iOS interviews and so he
and he has a good book to recommend to I
36:12 - forget what it's called eating Bahamas
almonds like the book he he has in his
36:18 - YouTube background and stuff you could
see it like on his shelf when he
36:21 - recorded videos so he's the guy to go if
you want to go through the interview
36:27 - process and another guy I'm Wayne Wayne
something I don't Adrian you might
36:35 - remember but we did Wayne Bishop yeah he
I think he has a consultation where he
36:42 - can do a mock interview with you so if
you want to practice doing interviews so
36:48 - you could you could do that for him oh
36:54 - good they just confirmed that he's using
a Mac Mini and that's fine watching from
37:00 - the Philippines hey Josh nice to see you
Hayley my voice is actually a lot lower
37:07 - than it usually is people say I have a
high voice because I'm kind of sick so
37:12 - my voice is a little lower
actually tutorials
37:18 - Dave asks where can they learn how to
write code to write apps that interface
37:22 - with the iPhone telephone audio
recording and video recording to build
37:25 - apps the screen telephone calls record
and playback audio so the I almost SDK
37:35 - has different frameworks where you can
interact with like the contacts list
37:44 - making phone calls sending SMS messages
and recording audio and recording video
37:50 - but I think from your question what
you're trying to do is you want that to
37:55 - screen the telephone call like basically
they intercept a telephone call I don't
38:02 - know if I can do that I don't know if
the SDK will have the ability for you to
38:09 - do that because it's not as open as say
like Android for example where I know
38:14 - you can do a lot and work with the
system so you're just gonna have to take
38:20 - through the documentation on iOS they
have a section on the phone and calling
38:27 - so you can dig through that but I'm
pretty sure you wouldn't be able to have
38:31 - your app intercept telephone calls and
decide what to do with them if that's
38:36 - what you're referring to if I'm
understanding you correctly Hana lunch
38:42 - you said you send each other programming
do you think you can understand I can
38:46 - understand it better I think so yeah I
study Java in school too that's what we
38:50 - we learned we learned a C++ and Java and
I feel like those were really good
38:57 - foundations for learning additional
stuff Jacob if we're not review I don't
39:05 - think I would know how to make apps
videos are very helpful thank you so
39:08 - much Nico I'm honestly so thankful for
you guys because without you guys this
39:14 - channel wouldn't be here
39:22 - and I'm fine it's just anything I'm not
just asking is there anything that you
39:28 - can study to excel in in Swift and I
think like it really depends what your
39:38 - goals aren't right if your goals are to
get a job and you're I think primarily
39:44 - you want to well I think understand if
you want it i OS job development job
39:51 - then you have to know the iOS
development side of it first but you
39:56 - also need to know they're gonna ask you
a whole bunch of like algorithm
40:00 - questions and stuff like that and design
pattern questions and stuff so you need
40:04 - to know all of that but if your goal is
to like let's say I want to build an app
40:09 - because I've always dreamed about having
this app in the App Store and I think a
40:14 - lot of people would be find it really
useful then you don't need to know as
40:20 - much of the theory like computer science
type stuff and you can just focus on app
40:27 - building which is pretty much like UI
kit Xcode Swift and you don't need to be
40:35 - as concerned with doing things the right
way or the best way you know because
40:41 - there's always going to be better ways
like the I don't think perfection is is
40:46 - attainable so if there's anything you
can study to excel I think it really
40:52 - depends if you're looking for a job then
I would say you know study the algorithm
40:57 - into new question type stuff provided
that you know kind of like the app
41:02 - development basics but if you just want
to build apps and I'd say just get more
41:08 - under your belt and I've always said
this and a lot of my courses and videos
41:11 - and I say like just because you've gone
through let's say my course where we
41:17 - build four apps together doesn't make
you suddenly like a know-it-all and you
41:22 - can build any app you want right it
gives you that foundation we're like
41:27 - okay you understand how an app works
what's involved how to build how to
41:32 - construct your UI how to
feeds how to do networking all of the
41:36 - stuff but there's still a ton of stuff
to learn but it's given you enough
41:39 - skills for you to now go out and consume
more knowledge and be able to process it
41:46 - efficiently and integrate it into your
tool belt and also things with how do I
41:52 - architect my app right that comes with
doing more apps you can't read a book on
41:59 - app architecture to suddenly become an
expert at it right because an app is so
42:05 - flexible there's so many different types
of apps and someone if you're doing
42:08 - consulting someone can ask you to do
anything there's never gonna be like a
42:12 - handful of patterns or architectures
that if you master then that's all you
42:19 - need to know right so my point is just
if your goal is to build your own app
42:25 - then I think to begin with once you get
the basics down is just the do more
42:30 - demos and do more tutorials and get the
hours in the more types of apps that you
42:36 - see from different people not just like
quote of course right like from other
42:40 - people the more you expose yourself to
the more experience you'll get and so
42:46 - when it comes time to build your own app
you're going to be like oh I saw that I
42:51 - remember doing that from this tutorial I
remember doing that in this demo that I
42:55 - built and then you can start to like
incorporate all of these elements and
42:59 - come up with your own stuff right almost
like if you're a chef if you're like a
43:06 - cook you might start by following other
people's recipes but once you've
43:11 - developed enough skills and you
understand enough about like taste and
43:16 - flavor and all of that stuff and how
different flavors interact with each
43:21 - other then you can start coming up with
your own cuisines and dishes alright it
43:30 - sucks that you need a Mac to build apps
VMware and I can touch the stuff to say
43:34 - yeah I agree with you man I agree with
you I think a lot of people are hung up
43:42 - on this and it almost makes me want to
do a video on using
43:46 - something like VMware or a cantata for
Mac and cloud or something or maybe
43:51 - maybe even showing like another
framework like some of you guys have
43:55 - been talking about Liz using other
frameworks that maybe work on PC 2 the
43:59 - Lapps I don't know if you guys would be
interested let me know if you are and
44:03 - then I might kind of like brought in my
horizons and start dabbling in those
44:08 - types of frameworks that are more PC
friendly and doing tutorials on those
44:18 - yeah ok so see boiler is saying that he
has a 2009 MacBook which he's upgraded a
44:27 - little bit Xcode working ok bit slow but
it's fine like run crashes a lot sorry
44:32 - dude yeah berliner mauer sorry if i
mispronounce ask what's the easiest way
44:46 - to animate a tableview bottom-up like in
the maps view I think if I remember the
44:52 - maps it's like a little little dialogue
that slides up I might be wrong I might
44:57 - be remembering things wrong but you
could just kind of use it UI view right
45:02 - and just slide it up you can animate it
up maybe I had the wrong idea if you
45:06 - want if you want to talk about that a
little more just join the Facebook
45:11 - community and I'd be happy to to take
take a little deeper on that with you I
45:20 - don't have a PC laptop over Android user
you keep asking this question how much
45:27 - can we earn monthly from a single app I
think that's a really strange question
45:32 - because you know those apps at companies
build like clash of clans or tinder for
45:38 - example they probably make a ton of
money all right but I'll be honest with
45:42 - you right as an indie developer I don't
think I don't think that many of your
45:49 - apps are hits I think as an indie
developer you probably be building a lot
45:53 - of apps and you might get like one viral
hit
45:58 - or if I were to do this personally and
if my goal were to make money in the App
46:03 - Store I wouldn't be trying to come up
with like the single great idea that no
46:11 - one has ever thought about before that
everyone's gonna find super useful and
46:15 - it's going to catch on and see biggest
ton money no that wouldn't be how I
46:18 - would do it I would basically focus on
content so for example right now my kid
46:28 - is four years old her name is Zoey and
she's learning phonetics and she gets
46:33 - these workbooks home from school where
she has these exercises to do and so I'm
46:38 - thinking like why can't I turn this into
an educational app so it could be like a
46:43 - learning aid to the curricula and then
you have like maybe not one app and then
46:48 - you do another and do another and do it
another all around that same concept
46:52 - right and you have like a catalog which
eventually you might be able to sell off
46:59 - to an educational company or you might
be able to charge like a subscription to
47:06 - more premium like activities or
exercises and stuff like that so I think
47:10 - it's all about content and I think it's
all about building a brand it's not like
47:15 - about a single app that's gonna make it
big for you I think you know it's
47:20 - possible I'm not gonna say it's
impossible but I think it's a lot harder
47:23 - to do it that way this asks
apps I make are frameworks wherever you
47:33 - put it in the app store yes yeah mark
asks any plans for our tutorial
47:41 - including Siri in an app that would be
really cool
47:49 - but I actually haven't looked into any
of that to be honest mark if you have
47:55 - like an article you're reading or
tutorial you're doing or something like
47:58 - that feel free to send it over I'd love
to look a little deeper into that so I
48:02 - think Siri is amazing
48:09 - Jacob asks he wants to make an app for
his wife but he can't get it on her
48:12 - phone without having to publish in in
the App Store well you can just like
48:21 - load it up on her device but yeah like
you can do that but you still need a
48:30 - developer program membership otherwise
it's going to expire in seven days
48:35 - because it's just for testing purposes
so everyone can load it onto a device
48:40 - and it just fails to open in seven days
unless you have a developer membership
48:46 - and then you can you can actually get a
provisioning profile for the app which
48:51 - will last longer
49:01 - sirikit that what it's called Adrian
49:15 - Berlin Berliner core NFC I haven't
looked at Dani and FC stuff
49:21 - unfortunately so I think he I think you
probably know more than me in that
49:26 - regard yes
when are you going to start building VI
49:34 - so sorry so sorry dude I couldn't figure
out how to show my screen I'm such a
49:38 - noob so I said what I'm going to do
instead is just
49:43 - two questions with you guys and hang out
and chat with you guys and I'll do that
49:47 - X Co ten war card game video as a
separate like standalone video and also
49:52 - publish on one channel but I'm gonna
figure out showing my screen in a live
49:58 - stream and then we can do that big asks
what do you think about apples everyone
50:16 - can code I know they have something that
they call that but I'm not exactly sure
50:20 - what it involves I know they have the
playgrounds app which is great for
50:29 - learning I know they have like some
teachers guides and stuff like that but
50:35 - in terms of everyone can code I'm not
exactly sure what that program involves
50:41 - I'm I really like the name though and I
actually was going to even use it
50:47 - everyone can cuz I thought of it myself
and then when I googled it I'm like oh
50:50 - Apple took it I can't use it now
50:56 - Fabian I'd like to see a full tutorial
in core data if you have time you know I
51:04 - thought about doing it but then the
thing is there's so many great core data
51:09 - stuff out there that that's what's been
holding me back on doing something like
51:16 - that because for me I never had to use
core data a lot so I'm not an expert in
51:22 - it and I'd have to like learn it and
then I have to do a tutorial on it which
51:27 - probably won't be as thorough and and
well done as other core data tutorials
51:33 - are already out there and so I would
start by searching out there first
51:37 - because like I don't Brian who has like
a core data course and rain Wonderlic
51:43 - has coordinator tutorials as well and so
check there for that
51:53 - Oh naväge says any possible courses
study for programming and app
51:57 - development I think a standard answer
for this is like the Stanford stuff if
52:01 - you have a programming background then
you you might be able to understand and
52:08 - consume that content and then I think
they're free on iTunes classroom or
52:12 - iTunes U or something like that so the
Stanford lectures on iOS development is
52:21 - it deceptive in your opinion when
third-party software promises that you
52:24 - can create iOS app on Windows but still
you eventually heading back to some into
52:27 - the App Store I don't think you need a
Mac to submit to the App Store because
52:41 - well you know what I'm not exactly sure
because in iTunes connected you guys I'm
52:46 - not familiar what happens in the typical
process is there's a web so once you pay
52:52 - for your Apple Developer membership
which is $99 a year you get access to
52:56 - iTunes Connect which is this website
where you can fill in the details for
53:00 - your app like upload the screenshots the
description what category set the price
53:05 - all that stuff and then when it comes
time for you to upload the app to iTunes
53:10 - Connect to connect it with like all of
that metadata you just set they tell you
53:15 - to do it through the application loader
in Xcode and Xcode is on Mac only now if
53:25 - you know for all of those other
solutions on PC that you can build an
53:31 - iOS app I'm sure there is a way I'm just
not familiar with it but if you could
53:38 - not submit apps that you build on
Windows you know through those
53:42 - third-party frameworks then I don't
think anybody would use it and I just
53:47 - don't know how how you would do it I
still think you have to pay the $99 a
53:51 - year for the Apple Developer membership
but I think there's another way that you
53:55 - can get that bundle to iTunes Connect
aside from using Xcode which is like you
54:01 - said Mac only
54:05 - okay Yanis says any any chance of
updating the RSS video from us less than
54:11 - 70 since the webview has changed to wk
web view um hasn't I know it has changed
54:18 - so the UI web being deprecated but is it
like really hard to figure out have you
54:25 - figured it out honest
is it a lot different using WK with you
54:30 - if it is then yeah maybe I'll do that
because usually when they kind of like
54:36 - that forget something and have a new
your version it's not that much
54:39 - different saya masks will frameworks
like flutter react or angular ultimately
54:58 - overpower that app development market if
we can build hybrid apps why go for iOS
55:03 - and I think this is this is a very very
interesting debate I'm interested to see
55:09 - where things will go as well but as it
stands right now I think that a lot of
55:20 - companies like like big companies who
have the money they still built natively
55:27 - for like Android and iOS separately and
this argument has been in existence for
55:35 - a long time like we're talking over
seven years ago like back then they had
55:42 - accelerate or anything of celebrators
still there and then have PhoneGap and
55:45 - stuff and we were doing software
consulting and our clients would always
55:52 - be like why am i paying you guys you
know like 50k to build this app for us
55:57 - natively and then paying like another
50k to build it on Windows following
56:02 - back then or Android or whatever when we
could use something like cross-platform
56:08 - solution like hybrid solution and build
it once then deploy it to both platforms
56:14 - and back then the easy answer was
because it was different like you just
56:19 - couldn't do this stuff you could do when
you built a native app it wasn't as fast
56:23 - it wasn't as like there were bugs with
those frameworks third-party frameworks
56:28 - and stuff like that and iOS changes
every year so when like the SDK changes
56:33 - in fact third-party framework tin like
catch up and kind of like update their
56:39 - own framework then it would just um then
your uh you would be out of luck so that
56:46 - your your business your app would be
dependent on this third-party updating
56:50 - their framework for the latest iOS so
that was like the answer back then that
56:54 - was the consideration these these these
things you know I haven't kept up with
56:58 - it I'm not sure if the decision is as
clear-cut as it used to be so I don't
57:08 - have an answer for you I'm kind of
waiting to see as well Karl asks about
57:19 - image formats so it used to be just PNG
so I just used to using PNG but I think
57:26 - these days you can also use JPEG and
Pina excuse me I'm not sure about bitmap
57:30 - and just files thanks adrian for
moderating thank you mr asks will you
57:44 - write some code today I'm waiting for
I'm sorry I couldn't figure out like I
57:48 - didn't prepare to share my screen and so
I thought it would just be like a button
57:52 - where I can share screen because when
you do a Google hangout that's how it
57:55 - works right there's a button on your
screen you can just share your screen
57:58 - with everyone but unfortunately with
this YouTube live stream it's not like
58:02 - that and it was another way where I have
to use like oleic acid or xsplit to
58:07 - actually present my screen and so I
wasn't set up for that I'm so sorry
58:11 - in the next live screen I'll try to set
that up in time so we can actually code
58:16 - together can we ban
people naväge you can wait with Swift
58:44 - hmm I'm not sure about that like aside
from using VMware and kind of like
58:51 - virtualizing a Mac yeah we have a link
we have an article that we wrote some
58:58 - Windows solutions but it just might not
be reusing Swift it's on site ok so it
59:08 - looks like I'm all caught up with the
questions do you guys have any more
59:14 - questions if not then we're gonna hang
out at the same time and it's about an
59:18 - hour mark right now is we'll hang out at
the same time I think I'm thinking the
59:23 - same time next week and at that time I'm
hoping to be more prepared to show you
59:30 - guys actually some code and we can also
do questions and you guys do also let me
59:34 - know through the comments and let me
know now kind of like do you appreciate
59:39 - more of like this question livestream
answering Q&A type of format you prefer
59:44 - to look at some code for me to show you
guys something live let me know please
59:52 - do a video on how to contribute to open
source projects on iOS ok we do have a
59:57 - list of requests and content ideas like
that so I'll write that down ok Fabian
60:07 - cool cool yeah I can do that I can do
that don't be good to have
60:15 - oh thanks Karl thanks for joining too
you know it's not just you know like I'm
60:21 - here I'm talking to you guys but it's
also your time right your time sitting
60:25 - here watching me and listening to me and
when I'm not answering your question
60:29 - you're just listening hopefully you're
getting something out of listening to
60:32 - other people's questions and answers as
well
60:35 - and I'm so glad that I'm so that glad

is actually like my biggest 132 people I
60:48 - think it'll grow if I do this every week
will be more and more people coming I
60:51 - hope you guys return next week awesome
awesome awesome Berlin Berlin keep

guys next time alright take care I'll
61:23 - see you guys next time bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys can you hear can you hear me and can see me I can't see how many people oh there we are there's seven people on hey guys what's up it's been a long time since I've done one of these live streams and even back then I was doing more of like presentation style so you guys would see slides and I would have like a prepared presentation but I just wanted to hang out with you guys and also I haven't done the war card game in Xcode 10 yet so I wanted to just do it with you it shouldn't be too hard I think I think it's gonna take 20 minutes to be honest and the rest of the time I'll just be chatting with you guys and hang out and answering some questions if I can Wow with 36 people on that's crazy because I didn't heavily promote this livestream because it's pretty much my first one probably this year in like ten months and so I didn't want to make a fool out of myself in front of all you guys so 36 people so far hey guys I also want to mention that Adrienne is in the chat so he'll be helping answering some questions if he knows the answers and also pointing you guys to existing resources we have a code address and if you guys haven't met Adrienne yet he's actually done some of the videos on the channel and he does all the video editing and he also helps out a lot in the community actually he pretty much handled all of it in like the Facebook groups that we have maybe Adrienne you can post the links to the Facebook groups in case some of these guys are not on it and we usually hang out in the Facebook communities as well and we we help a lot of students with the problems even if they're not learning with code with Chris type articles and they're learning with other articles we still try to help people out we can and then everyone actually helps each other out so it's a really good place to be hey guys alright so I'm gonna get started right away we're gonna launch Xcode 10 and NES turn right away and it's gonna be recorded so for people who are just gonna come late you guys can always catch up in the recording actually hey this is my first one I gotta share my screen can I do that oh please say I can share my screen is a huge fail on my part and find a button to share my screen and if we can't actually do this if we can't share my screen and I can't show this then we're just going to do a questionanswering session but I think it'd be fairly stupid if I couldn't actually share my screen good point sir can point the camera to my screen let me try and figure this out there like no buttons on on this interface here for me to do this all right you know what I'm gonna just point the camera to my screen let's see how it looks it might it might actually look pretty bad next week we'll do better guys okay guys this is really not ideal I wonder how it looks watch the they launch the screen on my laptop so I can see what you guys are seeing okay guys I think this might be as good as we're gonna get no good yeah you guys can't see anything you know what I'm just gonna record doing it next pretend as a separate video and in this livestream I'm just gonna hang out with you guys and I'm just going to answer questions and stuff I'll go through the chat if you guys google and you guys can find out how to share your screen through a YouTube livestream because they're honestly seen no buttons on the screen for me to do this it seems really stupid and odd to me I don't think that's right I think I'm just missing something actually alright it's gonna hang with you guys that was really the main point I wanted to do a live stream anyways I mean I could have recorded a video to do an Xcode 10 or card game tutorial at any point in time so alright let's just scroll through the chat and let's answer some questions okay so Jetson asks which design pattern to use and to be honest I haven't developed like professional apps in a long time back when I was in software consulting you just used MVC I think back then they didn't have a lot of the newer patterns that I'm hearing about these days like VIPRE and bbm and stuff like that yeah so those are it was that you're mentioning too and so to be honest the the type of stuff that I've been building has a bit like small demos and so it hasn't really mattered that much so I've still been using MBC but if you were building like enterprise type of application then that I'm sure you can consider the other types of design patterns and I'm not too familiar with them unfortunately I thank you tech with Jarvis um do you know what building a list asks do you know about building an app with JavaScript because that's what I want to use to build an app you can definitely do that because I think it was PhoneGap and some of the other thirdparty frameworks that you can use to build iOS apps with I think PhoneGap uses JavaScript if other people know please help Liz out and just let her know and they're like you can use react native you can use what's that other one with csharp that is just escapes me right now but you can there's a whole bunch of ways to build iOS apps well like the Apple endorsed recommended way is of course to buy like a Mac and use Xcode and to go through those types of things okay so Kay that's right react native electron actually if I haven't heard of that framework before yes Steve I know execute and works fine with the work our game app but a lot of my videos they show like the object library in the lower right hand corner and so I think for a lot of beginners who are just trying to find that object library they're gonna be super confused in Xcode 10 and so that's why I thought it'd be a good idea to show how to do it but I'm glad that Mexico tendon break a whole bunch of stuff because I don't know what like Auto layout first came out and back I'm like Xcode three four five those days were the roughest because every single year I had to read you everything how things changed so much but now that's now that's a lot better Oh Jacob thanks okay so I need I need some sort of a thirdparty software I'm so sorry guys this is like my first time doing this and I really wanted to to do that but I guess that up next time next week around this time we'll do a livestream again I'll show you guys something else I don't think we're gonna do the work art game in Xcode ten we'll probably do something else Jonathan Kim you prefer storyboard or all and eco would actually have a funny story about this that I've been meaning to turn into a video and I just haven't gotten around to it because I know if you guys are familiar Bryan moon who's also on YouTube he's a big proponent of using code only programmatic creating UI elements and just building the UI through code and I've been mostly showing people how to do stuff through storyboards so here's the story back then when I was still working in software consulting when we build Iowa's out it was honestly all code and we didn't use storyboards at all and I remember there was this one guy who we hired his name was Kia Bosch and I don't think he's watching so I think talking about but anyways he was selftaught and he came into our company and he used storyboards so he was a big proponent of storyboards and we we didn't make fun of him but we basically said you know like that's that's not the way to go right you have to use code to generate the UI it's just so much easier in terms of when you're working in a team and everyone's like committing code and sometimes you get conflicts because people are trying to change the same thing and once you get used to reading code to to like generate those elements and put them up into the view it's not that hard to see what's happening looking at different lines of code and imagining like in your head you kind of understand how things are how the UI will look so merging code and resolving conflicts via code was much easier than trying to merge and resolve conflicts be a storyboard so if like two developers changed something in the story word and they committed the the storyboard it's actually just this big XML file and trying to figure out what the columns like this was a headache for us and so that's one of the reasons why we went all code and to be honest it is faster than storyboard so once I left the company and I started teaching how to build apps online I realized that teaching beginners who have never coded before how to build UI through code is is tough right it makes people want to quit and so I started looking into storyboards I started using them as a teaching tool and it was good I started seeing like the good side of using storyboards right from a teaching perspective it's amazing right for for someone who's just a beginner who comes in and they can see oh I can build my UI like this I understand how a stack view works and all that stuff it's really it gets them excited right I guess them to want to learn more and I feel like the natural progression is like eventually as you get more experienced and then you're working you're working your way into becoming like working at a professional company where you're doing this for a living then by that point in time you will probably just be so familiar with building UI through code anyways but starting out I do recommend that you use tor more than Apple does do and their beginner walkthroughs and tutorials they always like use the storyboard so that I hope that answers her question I guess it kind of doesn't personally now so at this point in time if I were to build my personal app I've gotten so used to doing just like using the storyboard that I think I would do like a hybrid approach so if there are elements on the screen that are kind of like permanent and stationary I would just put those elements into the storyboard but then for like dynamic elements if I'm like pulling data through a feed and generating like little cards or news articles or whatever I might use code to generate those and then put them into the view so kind of like a hybrid approach to anything um Shawn Shawn Allen did some sort of video where he he gave it a name I forgot what he called it like was it the skeleton approach or something like that and I think that's kind of what he does as well exponents with that developer guy asks Xcode and sua seems more complicated than say learning Python or JavaScript do you have any advice for wading through the high learning curve hmm well I will say like Xcode itself yeah it does take a little bit of learning to understand where things are and how to use it Swift itself as a language I don't know if I agree with you that it's more complicated than Python but I think with with Python you might just have less to learn in the sense that you don't need that IDE for advice there's so many beginner resources out there for Xcode and Swift I think it's just as with anything like the more you're in Xcode the more you're like writing code the more familiar it's going to get so I think a lot of people tell me if I'm wrong guys a lot of people you know they watch videos or they read books but then when it comes to actually starting to code that's another story right it's a little tougher to to start doing that and making mistakes because some of you guys may have heard but my own story for learning iOS I failed that way too like I read a book front to back and keep in mind like I knew other programming languages so I'm coming from a programming background right now reading this book on objectivec and Xcode and everything makes sense as I'm going through it I'm like just banging through it and like yes this all makes sense that I'm going to be able to create this app but then by the end of the book when I just started launch the Xcode and I tried to build the project I realized that I forgot a lot of also what I read so my recommendation is don't consume too much content just consume like that first lesson are the first two lessons and then practice get on keyboard make mistakes try it out because that's what helps gets it sinking into your brain and then go on you know don't watch everything and then try to build enough after that the C Steve asks can you make a tutorial of sprite kit Xcode so sprite kit has been something that's been on my mind a lot because what got me into programming in the first place was building games and back then and as part of high school they had a computer programming class and in that class we used Turing which is a language I don't think is a lot of people heard of before but just the fact that I could type some code on the screen and create like a square give it a color make it move around that was so cool to me and I I was trying to create stuff that was pretty complicated like chess trying to draw the little like horsemen with these like shapes and stuff like that but it was just so much fun I was just doing in my spare time so going back to like gaming building games and stuff like that it's something that I definitely want to do a cover sprite kit I mean and sprite kit seems like such a natural progression from teaching app development already but personally if I were really serious about building games I would probably invest my time into learning unity that's just for the fact that um that's what the standard is right for industry like industry standard but I think for sprite kit it's kind of the natural the natural next step for me if I were wanting to start teaching a little bit of game development and I have the thing that excites me about that too is that I have a lot to learn because there's so many disciplines with a game development like you need to know how to draw right you need art you need sound like music and there's so many different disciplines to building a game versus building an app but Billy not be still you know you need the design aspect you need like the the user experience aspect but I feel like as a developer on some of those things you can you can I won't say fake but you can kind of learn over time like you don't have to be an expert designer and you can still create something that looks pretty good you don't have to be you know an expert and usability but just by using apps yourself you can still understand what's a nono right and what what's a good usable design but with game development I mean if you're not a sound composer and you don't have any musical ability it's it's hard to create a soundtrack for your game and I know actually a lot of those things you can by liking about my soundtracks you can buy art for your game and stuff like that and that's a lot easier to buy honestly than buying assets for an app let's say no yes it says if you guys notice that the pooh bear cub you don't judge it's actually his cup is really old actually this cup was my girlfriend's cut back then but now my wife and she somehow hates it now and so I use it I like it because it's a big mug all right what have we got here I see some links for the livestream computer screen so take a look at those Thank You Kate I'll take a look at those after I can't believe I'm so unprepared use Alamo fire or any other Pods or do you create all your elements like in the videos I don't understand the second part of your question do you create all of your elements like in the videos but in regards to alamo fire i did i do i mean i did created a video for that too and maybe it i won't i won't go and look for it now but if you go into my channel and then i don't know for the search feature but if you go back like in 2017 i think or maybe even 2016 i did a video for that johnson storyboard or nip file a storyboard i don't use no files too much but they're pretty much the same thing what is your process from moving from static mockups and prototypes into dev sketch envision to xcode oh this is a cool question martin because actually I just finished the design course and not where I'm teaching like design theory and because I'm not an expert in design but the course was more about what you're asking here so like how do we design something in sketch or envision and then how do you like take those elements out and then how do you integrate them into Xcode so I will show you guys through the YouTube channel parts of doing that over time because my plan for the channel is to build apps together and so you're gonna be seeing that endtoend process so this is a little like preview for next week or a couple of weeks later where I will be coming up with an idea with you guys I have a couple ideas and then we will together be flushing the idea out and turning into wireframes and then going through the design process and then building it out the next foot integrating those graphics and stuff like that so I think that not many people are doing that on YouTube and I feel like that would be the most helpful thing right I'm cool with doing oneoff tutorials and all of that but I feel like the complete process would be amazing and I want to do this like once a month so every month we can pump out an app and we can publish it together actually want to publish it to the App Store together I feel like it's ambitious I know but I think we can do it because I'm not going to be trying to boil the ocean I'm not going to be trying to create a super duper complicated out but anyways I've gone off on a tangent Martin to answer your question yeah so it's designing the the app design and sketch is one thing right and that takes a little bit of learning how to use sketch for example or envision and having a little bit of that creativity I think what really helps is looking at designs existing app designs on Pinterest or dribble or stuff like that and then taking elements that you like and try to recreate it and over time you're going to be able to have more originality and more creativity but at first what you're like staring at a blank canvas and you don't know what looks good my advice would just be to look at other designs that you think look in your opinion look good and try to recreate some of those elements pull different elements that you like into your own design so once you've created your app design the next step is not just to export everything every single element as images because there are a lot of elements that you can style programmatically encode and I would recommend to do that over loading up images because that takes that's more of a performance hit so things like buttons if they're just like solid colors with rounded corners and like a fancy font or something like that that's all you can do through code so you don't need to create an image graphic image for your button and then also the other discipline or sorry the other knowledge that you need inside Xcode is how different user interface elements work for example styling a button is very different from like styling a table view header or a table view cell that's different from styling like a slider or something like that and so through time you will learn how to style these different elements and then it gets easier and easier and easier and in terms of icons and stuff like that I personally don't draw my own icons you can buy icon packs and stuff like that so icons8.com as a service that I use for icons all right so let's ask if you use a framework to build an app yeah you would you would own the app because the framework is just like what it's built on but I want to make one distinction because there are app services out there like I build out calm I think is one of them and there are other services there are platforms out there where you don't have to code anything and all you do is like select different elements select what type of app you want and it's like a wizard that just steps you through and then by the end of it you have now it's for people who don't want to code and they don't really want to custom at and they just want a pretty on no rails type of that and then you would have to be more careful about that because I'm not sure if they own it or you own in or whatever I think you have to pay like a monthly subscription fee for to keep it in the App Store that's something you can look into but for you I think you were talking about with JavaScript anyways right so it sounds like you want to code your own out I'm glad you guys are answering chatting as well to Steve so Swift code right now yeah you can use it on other platforms there are some serverside platforms that you can use it online paper excuse me but I think Swift is just right now still primarily used on iOS and I think there are some some things people did on exploring using Swift on Android but I'm not too sure about that because it after all it is open source Thank You Robin you're awesome too how can I make an audio wave view while recording like the one on Apple I know what you're talking about like when you're recording something and there's like a little wave thing I'm not actually sure how to do that but try Google I might look into that in the future maybe someone's done a tutorial in it an idea ACV asks okay you guys are talking about the machine so I'm gonna skip that question let's see what we've got specs you know for in terms of machines I'm still using my laptop from let's see I'll tell you what I have I have a MacBook Pro Retina 13inch from early 2015 and it's 2.9 gigahertz Intel Core i5 with 16 gigs of ram and this machine which is streaming right now this is my iMac also from mid2015 3.3 gigahertz Intel Core i5 with 32 gigs of ram so this stuff is still running fine I mean I think the average lifespan until it gets like unbearably slow and you need to upgrade would be 4 to 5 years and that's just an estimate though don't don't hold me to that hey Haley awesome I'm glad you're working on that match game a plan to release a lot more apt tutorials for you guys I don't want to get too into it but I've been my family and I have been dealing with a lot of like health issues so you know agents been helping keep keep things moving around and on code with Chris but now thankfully to say everything's good we're back now so I'm planning to publish a lot more content for you guys and I'm really excited about that so as you can see I'm doing a live stream which is something that I don't I don't usually do and I want to do one of these like every week so I just so I can hang out with you guys and chat I feel like you know it's been 5 years since I've been doing code with Chris it's hard to believe 5 years and usually like behind the camera when you see me in the videos I do several takes and then sometimes not even like scripted out because I don't do well on live and Here I am right so uh I hope you guys aren't too hard on me but I feel like like with anything the more more of these I do the better or more comfortable again that's really the goal here I just want to be comfortable with you guys I don't you know I'm not gonna let that stand in my way of interacting with you guys and helping you guys build apps and learn how to live in one asks is there an advantage to using the pin button to a site constraints versus dragging and dropping the trains with the right mouse button honestly the if you're more familiar it's faster to use the right mouse button and just drag and drop the pin button is just when I do tutorials it's easier to demonstrate that so that you know there's no extra hold down command or like hold down control and then drag it and then hold down command to like multi select it's a couple of things and and that's harder to show through the screen and so when you watching my tutorials I'm always like clicking that pin button to bring up that menu and it's visual right so you can see all of these things that's a lot of users but once you get more familiar with it I would just do whatever's faster for you there's no difference tend to your question Mack many be good enough to develop apps yes definitely still worth becoming an iOS engineer for a job I think so I plan for one's gonna find me you guys are here right you guys are obviously interested in building iOS apps try looking at job postings around your area or glass door and stuff and I think it's still um still in demand but obviously I think if you want like a bulletproof job yeah platform I mean it's probably web development because that's probably never gonna go away but to be honest with you in this industry and technology you're always learning something new like iOS wasn't my first thing either right I was I was doing ESP net I remember like web sites web apps with asp.net and then I learned I excuse me I'm a little bit sick I even touched into flash flex I did like the Microsoft came up with these big touch tables the Microsoft Surface did that that was using like WPF so I you know as your career evolves you're going to be learning all sorts of different platforms technologies and so I don't think there's a bulletproof thing and the thing is if you pigeonhole yourself and me like oh I I'm only gonna do iOS and that's all I want to do which is great for when there are lots of work for that right but you know when there comes to the time when there isn't then then you're not going to be as flexible maybe and because because these platforms they're always evolving and if you're not keeping up and you're not learning new things along with it then you're kind of gonna be left in the dust Hassim asks you make any tutorial without preparation to show us your process when making something new how to think and use apple's documentation so if you missed it earlier i didn't mention that we're going to be building apps the other buns on this channel so we're gonna step through like the endtoend process where we start off with like i da ting and then coming up with your part minutes and and building out the UI and stuff like that and i'll be doing it that through these live streams that were you every week unfortunately there's only like four weeks a month and i want to publish an app by the end of the month so i might have to do some through videos but you guys will still be able to see a lot of the process hi Ricky thanks Hayley can you tell me a good source for iowa's interview questions to be honest I think Shaun Helens also on YouTube would be good for that because he was actually going through iOS interviews and so he and he has a good book to recommend to I forget what it's called eating Bahamas almonds like the book he he has in his YouTube background and stuff you could see it like on his shelf when he recorded videos so he's the guy to go if you want to go through the interview process and another guy I'm Wayne Wayne something I don't Adrian you might remember but we did Wayne Bishop yeah he I think he has a consultation where he can do a mock interview with you so if you want to practice doing interviews so you could you could do that for him oh good they just confirmed that he's using a Mac Mini and that's fine watching from the Philippines hey Josh nice to see you Hayley my voice is actually a lot lower than it usually is people say I have a high voice because I'm kind of sick so my voice is a little lower actually tutorials Dave asks where can they learn how to write code to write apps that interface with the iPhone telephone audio recording and video recording to build apps the screen telephone calls record and playback audio so the I almost SDK has different frameworks where you can interact with like the contacts list making phone calls sending SMS messages and recording audio and recording video but I think from your question what you're trying to do is you want that to screen the telephone call like basically they intercept a telephone call I don't know if I can do that I don't know if the SDK will have the ability for you to do that because it's not as open as say like Android for example where I know you can do a lot and work with the system so you're just gonna have to take through the documentation on iOS they have a section on the phone and calling so you can dig through that but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be able to have your app intercept telephone calls and decide what to do with them if that's what you're referring to if I'm understanding you correctly Hana lunch you said you send each other programming do you think you can understand I can understand it better I think so yeah I study Java in school too that's what we we learned we learned a C++ and Java and I feel like those were really good foundations for learning additional stuff Jacob if we're not review I don't think I would know how to make apps videos are very helpful thank you so much Nico I'm honestly so thankful for you guys because without you guys this channel wouldn't be here and I'm fine it's just anything I'm not just asking is there anything that you can study to excel in in Swift and I think like it really depends what your goals aren't right if your goals are to get a job and you're I think primarily you want to well I think understand if you want it i OS job development job then you have to know the iOS development side of it first but you also need to know they're gonna ask you a whole bunch of like algorithm questions and stuff like that and design pattern questions and stuff so you need to know all of that but if your goal is to like let's say I want to build an app because I've always dreamed about having this app in the App Store and I think a lot of people would be find it really useful then you don't need to know as much of the theory like computer science type stuff and you can just focus on app building which is pretty much like UI kit Xcode Swift and you don't need to be as concerned with doing things the right way or the best way you know because there's always going to be better ways like the I don't think perfection is is attainable so if there's anything you can study to excel I think it really depends if you're looking for a job then I would say you know study the algorithm into new question type stuff provided that you know kind of like the app development basics but if you just want to build apps and I'd say just get more under your belt and I've always said this and a lot of my courses and videos and I say like just because you've gone through let's say my course where we build four apps together doesn't make you suddenly like a knowitall and you can build any app you want right it gives you that foundation we're like okay you understand how an app works what's involved how to build how to construct your UI how to feeds how to do networking all of the stuff but there's still a ton of stuff to learn but it's given you enough skills for you to now go out and consume more knowledge and be able to process it efficiently and integrate it into your tool belt and also things with how do I architect my app right that comes with doing more apps you can't read a book on app architecture to suddenly become an expert at it right because an app is so flexible there's so many different types of apps and someone if you're doing consulting someone can ask you to do anything there's never gonna be like a handful of patterns or architectures that if you master then that's all you need to know right so my point is just if your goal is to build your own app then I think to begin with once you get the basics down is just the do more demos and do more tutorials and get the hours in the more types of apps that you see from different people not just like quote of course right like from other people the more you expose yourself to the more experience you'll get and so when it comes time to build your own app you're going to be like oh I saw that I remember doing that from this tutorial I remember doing that in this demo that I built and then you can start to like incorporate all of these elements and come up with your own stuff right almost like if you're a chef if you're like a cook you might start by following other people's recipes but once you've developed enough skills and you understand enough about like taste and flavor and all of that stuff and how different flavors interact with each other then you can start coming up with your own cuisines and dishes alright it sucks that you need a Mac to build apps VMware and I can touch the stuff to say yeah I agree with you man I agree with you I think a lot of people are hung up on this and it almost makes me want to do a video on using something like VMware or a cantata for Mac and cloud or something or maybe maybe even showing like another framework like some of you guys have been talking about Liz using other frameworks that maybe work on PC 2 the Lapps I don't know if you guys would be interested let me know if you are and then I might kind of like brought in my horizons and start dabbling in those types of frameworks that are more PC friendly and doing tutorials on those yeah ok so see boiler is saying that he has a 2009 MacBook which he's upgraded a little bit Xcode working ok bit slow but it's fine like run crashes a lot sorry dude yeah berliner mauer sorry if i mispronounce ask what's the easiest way to animate a tableview bottomup like in the maps view I think if I remember the maps it's like a little little dialogue that slides up I might be wrong I might be remembering things wrong but you could just kind of use it UI view right and just slide it up you can animate it up maybe I had the wrong idea if you want if you want to talk about that a little more just join the Facebook community and I'd be happy to to take take a little deeper on that with you I don't have a PC laptop over Android user you keep asking this question how much can we earn monthly from a single app I think that's a really strange question because you know those apps at companies build like clash of clans or tinder for example they probably make a ton of money all right but I'll be honest with you right as an indie developer I don't think I don't think that many of your apps are hits I think as an indie developer you probably be building a lot of apps and you might get like one viral hit or if I were to do this personally and if my goal were to make money in the App Store I wouldn't be trying to come up with like the single great idea that no one has ever thought about before that everyone's gonna find super useful and it's going to catch on and see biggest ton money no that wouldn't be how I would do it I would basically focus on content so for example right now my kid is four years old her name is Zoey and she's learning phonetics and she gets these workbooks home from school where she has these exercises to do and so I'm thinking like why can't I turn this into an educational app so it could be like a learning aid to the curricula and then you have like maybe not one app and then you do another and do another and do it another all around that same concept right and you have like a catalog which eventually you might be able to sell off to an educational company or you might be able to charge like a subscription to more premium like activities or exercises and stuff like that so I think it's all about content and I think it's all about building a brand it's not like about a single app that's gonna make it big for you I think you know it's possible I'm not gonna say it's impossible but I think it's a lot harder to do it that way this asks apps I make are frameworks wherever you put it in the app store yes yeah mark asks any plans for our tutorial including Siri in an app that would be really cool but I actually haven't looked into any of that to be honest mark if you have like an article you're reading or tutorial you're doing or something like that feel free to send it over I'd love to look a little deeper into that so I think Siri is amazing Jacob asks he wants to make an app for his wife but he can't get it on her phone without having to publish in in the App Store well you can just like load it up on her device but yeah like you can do that but you still need a developer program membership otherwise it's going to expire in seven days because it's just for testing purposes so everyone can load it onto a device and it just fails to open in seven days unless you have a developer membership and then you can you can actually get a provisioning profile for the app which will last longer sirikit that what it's called Adrian Berlin Berliner core NFC I haven't looked at Dani and FC stuff unfortunately so I think he I think you probably know more than me in that regard yes when are you going to start building VI so sorry so sorry dude I couldn't figure out how to show my screen I'm such a noob so I said what I'm going to do instead is just two questions with you guys and hang out and chat with you guys and I'll do that X Co ten war card game video as a separate like standalone video and also publish on one channel but I'm gonna figure out showing my screen in a live stream and then we can do that big asks what do you think about apples everyone can code I know they have something that they call that but I'm not exactly sure what it involves I know they have the playgrounds app which is great for learning I know they have like some teachers guides and stuff like that but in terms of everyone can code I'm not exactly sure what that program involves I'm I really like the name though and I actually was going to even use it everyone can cuz I thought of it myself and then when I googled it I'm like oh Apple took it I can't use it now Fabian I'd like to see a full tutorial in core data if you have time you know I thought about doing it but then the thing is there's so many great core data stuff out there that that's what's been holding me back on doing something like that because for me I never had to use core data a lot so I'm not an expert in it and I'd have to like learn it and then I have to do a tutorial on it which probably won't be as thorough and and well done as other core data tutorials are already out there and so I would start by searching out there first because like I don't Brian who has like a core data course and rain Wonderlic has coordinator tutorials as well and so check there for that Oh naväge says any possible courses study for programming and app development I think a standard answer for this is like the Stanford stuff if you have a programming background then you you might be able to understand and consume that content and then I think they're free on iTunes classroom or iTunes U or something like that so the Stanford lectures on iOS development is it deceptive in your opinion when thirdparty software promises that you can create iOS app on Windows but still you eventually heading back to some into the App Store I don't think you need a Mac to submit to the App Store because well you know what I'm not exactly sure because in iTunes connected you guys I'm not familiar what happens in the typical process is there's a web so once you pay for your Apple Developer membership which is $99 a year you get access to iTunes Connect which is this website where you can fill in the details for your app like upload the screenshots the description what category set the price all that stuff and then when it comes time for you to upload the app to iTunes Connect to connect it with like all of that metadata you just set they tell you to do it through the application loader in Xcode and Xcode is on Mac only now if you know for all of those other solutions on PC that you can build an iOS app I'm sure there is a way I'm just not familiar with it but if you could not submit apps that you build on Windows you know through those thirdparty frameworks then I don't think anybody would use it and I just don't know how how you would do it I still think you have to pay the $99 a year for the Apple Developer membership but I think there's another way that you can get that bundle to iTunes Connect aside from using Xcode which is like you said Mac only okay Yanis says any any chance of updating the RSS video from us less than 70 since the webview has changed to wk web view um hasn't I know it has changed so the UI web being deprecated but is it like really hard to figure out have you figured it out honest is it a lot different using WK with you if it is then yeah maybe I'll do that because usually when they kind of like that forget something and have a new your version it's not that much different saya masks will frameworks like flutter react or angular ultimately overpower that app development market if we can build hybrid apps why go for iOS and I think this is this is a very very interesting debate I'm interested to see where things will go as well but as it stands right now I think that a lot of companies like like big companies who have the money they still built natively for like Android and iOS separately and this argument has been in existence for a long time like we're talking over seven years ago like back then they had accelerate or anything of celebrators still there and then have PhoneGap and stuff and we were doing software consulting and our clients would always be like why am i paying you guys you know like 50k to build this app for us natively and then paying like another 50k to build it on Windows following back then or Android or whatever when we could use something like crossplatform solution like hybrid solution and build it once then deploy it to both platforms and back then the easy answer was because it was different like you just couldn't do this stuff you could do when you built a native app it wasn't as fast it wasn't as like there were bugs with those frameworks thirdparty frameworks and stuff like that and iOS changes every year so when like the SDK changes in fact thirdparty framework tin like catch up and kind of like update their own framework then it would just um then your uh you would be out of luck so that your your business your app would be dependent on this thirdparty updating their framework for the latest iOS so that was like the answer back then that was the consideration these these these things you know I haven't kept up with it I'm not sure if the decision is as clearcut as it used to be so I don't have an answer for you I'm kind of waiting to see as well Karl asks about image formats so it used to be just PNG so I just used to using PNG but I think these days you can also use JPEG and Pina excuse me I'm not sure about bitmap and just files thanks adrian for moderating thank you mr asks will you write some code today I'm waiting for I'm sorry I couldn't figure out like I didn't prepare to share my screen and so I thought it would just be like a button where I can share screen because when you do a Google hangout that's how it works right there's a button on your screen you can just share your screen with everyone but unfortunately with this YouTube live stream it's not like that and it was another way where I have to use like oleic acid or xsplit to actually present my screen and so I wasn't set up for that I'm so sorry in the next live screen I'll try to set that up in time so we can actually code together can we ban people naväge you can wait with Swift hmm I'm not sure about that like aside from using VMware and kind of like virtualizing a Mac yeah we have a link we have an article that we wrote some Windows solutions but it just might not be reusing Swift it's on site ok so it looks like I'm all caught up with the questions do you guys have any more questions if not then we're gonna hang out at the same time and it's about an hour mark right now is we'll hang out at the same time I think I'm thinking the same time next week and at that time I'm hoping to be more prepared to show you guys actually some code and we can also do questions and you guys do also let me know through the comments and let me know now kind of like do you appreciate more of like this question livestream answering Q&A type of format you prefer to look at some code for me to show you guys something live let me know please do a video on how to contribute to open source projects on iOS ok we do have a list of requests and content ideas like that so I'll write that down ok Fabian cool cool yeah I can do that I can do that don't be good to have oh thanks Karl thanks for joining too you know it's not just you know like I'm here I'm talking to you guys but it's also your time right your time sitting here watching me and listening to me and when I'm not answering your question you're just listening hopefully you're getting something out of listening to other people's questions and answers as well and I'm so glad that I'm so that glad that you guys talk because I think out of all the live streams I've done this is actually like my biggest 132 people I think it'll grow if I do this every week will be more and more people coming I hope you guys return next week awesome awesome awesome Berlin Berlin keep messing yellow please correct me please correct me so that when I see you next time on the livestream I'll know how to pronounce your name thanks Haley thanks guys thanks thanks Arturo I'll see you guys next time alright take care I'll see you guys next time bye for now
