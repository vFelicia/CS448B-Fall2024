00:05 - hey guys Chris here with another Xcode
00:09 - tip for you guys and this time I'm gonna
00:12 - show you guys how to enable the line
00:15 - numbers in your code editor so I think
00:18 - by default they don't show up and I
00:22 - forget that fact because I sometimes get
00:24 - people asking me how to turn on the line
00:26 - numbers and I'm like what do you mean I
00:29 - thought they were there by default but
00:30 - apparently they're not well it's very
00:32 - easy to enable just go to up to the
00:35 - Xcode menu here go to preferences and
00:38 - then go to text editing and here is a
00:44 - checkbox for line numbers all you need
00:46 - to do is enable that you know make sure
00:49 - that's checked and then you'll see line
00:52 - numbers
