With timestamps:

00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - hey it's chris here wanted to give you a
00:07 - quick
00:07 - development progress update so uh i have
00:11 - just
00:11 - launched the app and this is a fresh
00:13 - install
00:14 - and what the user is going to see is a
00:17 - sort of onboarding sequence
00:19 - this first message is going to tell them
00:21 - what the app is about
00:22 - they click continue the next one is
00:24 - going to tell them that they can tap on
00:26 - a metric
00:27 - uh tap and hold i think we should say
00:29 - because that's actually the
00:31 - proper gesture they can tap and hold to
00:34 - bring up a tooltip
00:36 - and then they can also tap on the list
00:38 - tab to start tracking their own
00:39 - competitors
00:40 - so what we have here is sort of like a
00:42 - dummy profile this
00:44 - this one doesn't make any requests out
00:46 - to the instagram api at this point
00:48 - because
00:48 - we don't have their account token or
00:51 - sorry
00:52 - their access token to use for any sort
00:54 - of network api requests
00:56 - after they play around with this dummy
00:58 - profile they're going to
01:00 - click on list and they're going to be
01:01 - able to log in with facebook
01:04 - to access their connected instagram
01:07 - business
01:07 - profile and the reason again if you
01:10 - didn't catch the other videos the reason
01:11 - we have to log in with facebook
01:13 - is because we need to have all these
01:15 - requirements to use the specific
01:17 - instagram api that we are using
01:20 - so i'm going to hit login with facebook
01:22 - and because i've logged in before
01:23 - even though this is a fresh install i
01:25 - think it saves
01:26 - some sort of information on the system
01:30 - itself
01:31 - so although i deleted the app and i ran
01:34 - xcode to reinstall it it still
01:36 - knows that i've logged in before so i
01:39 - don't have to enter in my password
01:41 - uh you'll also see that i changed the
01:43 - icon this is just
01:45 - it was just a placeholder icon something
01:46 - we we whipped up really quickly
01:49 - to submit our facebook app for review
01:52 - didn't want to
01:54 - you know get hung up on that and i also
01:56 - changed the name from cwc app to profile
01:58 - scorecards
02:01 - so we'll do that and we're in okay so i
02:04 - am going to
02:05 - search for a username
02:08 - and i'll click this and we're going to
02:10 - come here and if you tap and hold on any
02:13 - metric
02:14 - you're going to be able to see a tooltip
02:16 - describing what it is and how to use it
02:18 - and why it's important
02:20 - something else we've implemented is copy
02:22 - hashtag so this works
02:23 - copying to your clipboard uh we also
02:26 - have this
02:27 - tapping on a post to bring up a bigger
02:30 - version of it
02:31 - you can see that things are still in
02:34 - development because things are out of
02:36 - place
02:36 - however this will show them you know the
02:39 - caption
02:40 - a truncated version of the caption and
02:42 - give them a button to open this
02:43 - in the browser or on instagram now if i
02:46 - close this i know it's gonna crash
02:48 - because
02:48 - you know we're still building this and
02:50 - that's a bug we still need to work out
02:53 - but yeah if you add um a test one for
02:56 - example
02:58 - a dummy profile that doesn't exist will
03:00 - show some sort of error message there
03:02 - we have a setting screen a lot log out
03:04 - button right there
03:06 - just to quickly show you uh the design
03:09 - part of it in case you missed the other
03:10 - video you can see
03:12 - that is the three-step onboarding
03:13 - process
03:15 - this is the profile analytics screen
03:17 - with the pop-up tooltips
03:19 - and there are still some error states
03:23 - that we have to
03:25 - program in we don't have this pay wall
03:27 - we might actually launch without that
03:28 - because
03:30 - depending on how much time we have left
03:32 - um
03:33 - because we do want to launch this and do
03:35 - some app marketing before
03:38 - you know maybe hopefully before end of
03:41 - april
03:41 - but we're targeting end of april to have
03:44 - the app at least launched
03:47 - and then here's the feed screen where
03:49 - you can
03:50 - add or the list screen where you can add
03:53 - profiles
03:56 - so that's the design here i think in
03:58 - terms of functionality it really is just
04:01 - we've got most of it down need to nail
04:04 - down all of the
04:06 - um the error cases and the edge cases to
04:09 - make sure that app doesn't crash or
04:10 - behave
04:11 - strangely and also you can see that we
04:14 - have quite a bit of work to do in terms
04:15 - of styling
04:16 - the app which i'll talk about in the
04:18 - future video like how we're going to
04:20 - apply this design to the app
04:22 - i'll talk about that later um in terms
04:24 - of other progress
04:25 - we've actually got our facebook app
04:27 - review approved
04:29 - from the facebook team so we submitted
04:32 - our you know it was quite an arduous
04:35 - process actually
04:38 - so if i go to app review here and go
04:41 - down to requests
04:42 - and you can see here that this review
04:46 - was completed and we requested these
04:49 - three permissions
04:51 - and that it was approved
04:55 - so that took way faster than we thought
04:58 - um even in the documentation it take it
05:01 - said it'd take a few weeks from stack
05:03 - overflow we saw other people's
05:04 - experiences that
05:05 - they said it took a few weeks for us we
05:08 - submitted it
05:08 - maybe 2 p.m in the afternoon and i heard
05:11 - back
05:12 - at about 9 00 pm that same day and
05:15 - luckily we were approved so that's
05:18 - amazing
05:19 - and if i didn't tell you before
05:23 - what we needed to provide for the review
05:26 - you actually need to provide
05:28 - an app for them and they provide
05:31 - instructions on how to do this but
05:32 - essentially when you build your xcode
05:34 - app
05:35 - and it produces this dot app file here
05:38 - you can go
05:38 - show in finder and then you can
05:42 - you basically zip up this dot app file
05:44 - and you upload it to them and they're
05:46 - going to be able to launch in the
05:47 - simulator and try it out
05:49 - we also have to explain why we are
05:52 - requesting these permissions
05:53 - so for every single permission you
05:55 - request you tell them
05:56 - why you need it and how you're using it
05:58 - and provide a little screencast
06:00 - a walkthrough of how you're using it so
06:03 - we did this for
06:04 - all three of the permissions that we
06:06 - were requesting
06:08 - and then yeah we got approved and in
06:11 - terms of
06:12 - the app website we've also made a little
06:14 - bit of progress on that
06:16 - so i mentioned before that our designer
06:18 - also happens to be a copywriter by trade
06:21 - and so he is going to be creating all of
06:24 - the copy
06:25 - and the graphics for our app website
06:28 - normally
06:28 - i would suggest for most people just to
06:31 - create like a one-page website website
06:34 - you know as long as you have i would say
06:36 - links to
06:37 - your app in the app store you know a
06:39 - place for people to provide feedback and
06:41 - to get support
06:43 - another good thing would be a way for
06:45 - people to sign up to a newsletter not a
06:48 - newsletter but like a mailing list
06:49 - so that you can email them if there's a
06:51 - new app feature or
06:53 - something like that capturing someone's
06:54 - email would be great
06:56 - if they want to hear more about the app
06:58 - in the future
06:59 - for us because we are planning to build
07:03 - future apps um after this one
07:06 - and we all want it to live under the
07:08 - same
07:09 - sort of family or the same name it's not
07:11 - going to be under code with chris
07:13 - we are going to have another name
07:17 - i registered a domain called madeapps.io
07:20 - there's nothing there right now
07:22 - but i imagine that
07:25 - you know all of the apps we build will
07:28 - will be under this sort of brand or name
07:31 - and we're going to have
07:32 - it's going to have its own website and
07:34 - then it's going to contain
07:36 - information about all of the apps that
07:39 - that we build so i would i would say for
07:42 - the website use what you know there's no
07:44 - need to learn a new skill like to go
07:46 - learn react or to go learn
07:48 - javascript or html or anything like that
07:50 - just to build this website
07:51 - use a website builder some people just
07:54 - use a facebook page right
07:57 - so don't get hung up on building a
07:58 - website for your app
08:00 - it's definitely not the most important
08:02 - thing
08:03 - in our situation our designer
08:06 - also happens to have some knowledge
08:09 - about using webflow
08:11 - so we're going to have him build
08:14 - the website using webflow
08:17 - which is a little more involved because
08:19 - it's not
08:21 - it i don't know if you've seen webflow
08:23 - before i've created a tutorial on it
08:25 - before but
08:26 - it is a way to
08:30 - like it's not completely drag and drop
08:32 - like
08:33 - squarespace or wix or something like
08:35 - that i think those would
08:37 - be a little more intuitive this is a
08:39 - visual builder
08:40 - but there's also a lot of coding
08:43 - components to it so
08:45 - it's sort of in between coding it by
08:48 - writing raw code
08:50 - and completely building it using a
08:52 - visual interface
08:54 - like wix or squarespace so it's
08:56 - somewhere in the middle
08:58 - um like i said i would not recommend to
09:01 - learn a new tool just to
09:03 - build the website yeah so that's that so
09:05 - that's what's happening i'm
09:06 - it we're really lucky in the sense that
09:09 - jc
09:10 - is able to do uh he's sort of
09:12 - multi-disciplinary
09:13 - if it were up to me um i
09:16 - probably would have just whipped
09:18 - something up in wordpress because that's
09:19 - what i'm used to
09:20 - that's what word code with chris runs on
09:23 - wordpress
09:24 - slap a theme on it you know customize
09:26 - the text put some graphics on it and
09:28 - boom there you go
09:29 - you have a simple web page yeah so
09:32 - that's it
09:33 - and i hope you enjoyed this video in the
09:35 - next insight video i'll probably talk
09:37 - about how we're going to
09:39 - apply this design into our xcode project
09:42 - because as you can see
09:43 - it's looking pretty bare functionally
09:45 - most of it is there
09:47 - but it's still not looking like the
09:48 - designs quite yet
09:50 - alright this has been a long video
09:52 - thanks so much i'll see you in the next
09:53 - one

Cleaned transcript:

hey it's chris here wanted to give you a quick development progress update so uh i have just launched the app and this is a fresh install and what the user is going to see is a sort of onboarding sequence this first message is going to tell them what the app is about they click continue the next one is going to tell them that they can tap on a metric uh tap and hold i think we should say because that's actually the proper gesture they can tap and hold to bring up a tooltip and then they can also tap on the list tab to start tracking their own competitors so what we have here is sort of like a dummy profile this this one doesn't make any requests out to the instagram api at this point because we don't have their account token or sorry their access token to use for any sort of network api requests after they play around with this dummy profile they're going to click on list and they're going to be able to log in with facebook to access their connected instagram business profile and the reason again if you didn't catch the other videos the reason we have to log in with facebook is because we need to have all these requirements to use the specific instagram api that we are using so i'm going to hit login with facebook and because i've logged in before even though this is a fresh install i think it saves some sort of information on the system itself so although i
