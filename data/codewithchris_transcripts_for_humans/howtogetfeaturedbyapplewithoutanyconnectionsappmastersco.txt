02:10 - great looking app it's
02:12 - well done you spent months and months
02:14 - listening to code with Chris to figure
02:17 - out how to actually implement every
02:19 - little thing to make it so polish and
02:22 - now you want to get it out into the
02:23 - masses and you want to get featured by

02:27 - developers well I'm gonna show you step
02:29 - by step how to do that through a cold
02:32 - email step one make a great app I know
02:37 - I'm being Captain Obvious here but it's
02:40 - so true not all apps are going to get
02:43 - featured by Apple they want to highlight
02:46 - the best apps in the App space and Apple
02:50 - they are good about making sure that
02:53 - they care about their consumers right
02:55 - they care about their customers so they
02:57 - want to highlight apps that really
02:59 - highlight the Apple brand well and so
03:02 - make sure you've done all your legwork
03:04 - you'll listen to all of Chris's videos
03:07 - and you made a really really good
03:09 - looking out
03:10 - make sure it's designed well as well yes
03:13 - I know it's obvious so I wanted to
03:15 - highlight the fact that yes it's obvious
03:16 - but I think it's worth stating to please
03:19 - make sure you made a good app okay
03:23 - number two and here's the real cool
03:25 - thing about it find the right contact
03:27 - person at Apple now that's really easy
03:30 - I'm gonna show you how to do that right
03:32 - now
03:33 - now the apps are so huge right there's
03:36 - thousands of thousands of new apps
03:37 - coming out every single day
03:39 - and what you have to find is the right
03:41 - app store manager at Apple there are app
03:43 - store managers that cater to a specific
03:46 - category so here's what you do
03:48 - put app store manager into the search
03:51 - field oh I'm actually on LinkedIn so go
03:53 - to linkedin.com and look search for App
03:56 - Store Manager okay and I'm gonna hide
04:02 - everybody's info because I don't want
04:03 - you seeing everything but what you want
04:05 - to do is make sure you go down here and
04:07 - you pick Apple as the current company
04:10 - and then what you want to look for is
04:14 - the app store manager for your specific
04:17 - category okay and so just make sure
04:21 - there's a ton right you can see here
04:22 - that there are a few that cater to games
04:24 - there's gonna be
04:25 - you that cater to education there's a
04:28 - few that's gonna cater to whatever
04:29 - category you're trying to get into just
04:31 - make sure you find the right person for
04:34 - that now that you found the right person
04:37 - to contact what you want to do next is
04:40 - find the email address I know it seems
04:43 - pretty obvious let me show you a dead
04:45 - simple way on how to do that so I'm
04:47 - gonna go back to my screen I'm using
04:49 - Google Chrome right now and go to a site
04:52 - called email hunter CO email hunter CO
04:57 - and I'm using Google Chrome so I
04:59 - installed the email hunter for Chrome
05:01 - extension that you can see right here
05:03 - now what you want to do here I'll click
05:07 - it just so you can see it but it says
05:09 - email hunter for Chrome and this adds
05:10 - this little button right here so if
05:13 - you're on somebody else's domain so if
05:15 - you're on at masters CO or if I'm code
05:17 - with Chris calm and you really want to
05:19 - find out Chris's email address you can
05:20 - click this little button right here and
05:22 - it'll give you all the email addresses
05:24 - that are related to that domain really
05:27 - handy tool right but I love it too
05:30 - because it actually adds a button on to
05:32 - LinkedIn profiles I'm not going to show
05:35 - you the email addresses of the Apple
05:37 - contacts because I don't want to expose
05:38 - them but I'm going to show you that when
05:40 - you have the email hunter tool installed
05:43 - and you're on LinkedIn you get this
05:44 - handy button and even if you're trying
05:47 - to target anybody I don't like leads or
05:49 - anybody else maybe even a journalist you
05:52 - can click that button it'll give you the
05:53 - email address of that person I've found
05:56 - the email address of the Apple App Store
05:59 - manager using this exact process so
06:03 - email hunter is the tool to use number
06:06 - four the next step after you found the
06:09 - right person you have their email
06:11 - address it's time to write a compelling
06:13 - email so what's that involved it takes a
06:16 - lot of time I've done it a lot and it
06:19 - takes a lot of time to really figure out
06:21 - so it's gonna take some practice and I
06:23 - would say ask your friends ask your
06:25 - network to see what they think of your
06:27 - email and make sure you get it right ok
06:30 - you want to get the first one right so
06:32 - here's some things to include in your
06:33 - email this is what we do really well
06:36 - number one have a video keep it
06:39 - short sixty seconds show the general
06:41 - gameplay of your app so whether it's a
06:44 - game or if it's an app like a
06:46 - Productivity app just show the general
06:48 - use of the app doesn't have to be high
06:50 - quality but the more high quality you
06:52 - can get it the better it is because
06:55 - literally four reporters and four Apple
06:58 - employees less important for the Apple
07:00 - employees but definitely important when
07:01 - you're reaching out for the press the
07:03 - quality of your app will be used to
07:04 - judge the quality I'm sorry let me
07:06 - rephrase this the quality of your video
07:08 - would be used to judge the quality of
07:10 - your app so if you have a really bad
07:11 - video they're gonna think that you have
07:13 - a really bad app right now for when
07:15 - you're pitching Apple it's gonna be ok
07:17 - because they understand that it's just a
07:19 - general gameplay and they want to show
07:21 - them what the app is all about rather
07:23 - than tell them so it's always better to
07:24 - show them if you can include a video do
07:26 - it you have to have it number two this
07:30 - is one thing I think most people forget
07:32 - about is to leverage social proof so
07:35 - things to think about when you're trying
07:36 - to think about social proof like Steve
07:38 - what is social proof well have any of
07:40 - your apps been featured that's one thing
07:42 - right if I haven't featured why am i
07:45 - watching this video okay I get you I get
07:47 - you but just in case it has make sure
07:49 - you make it known do you have millions
07:52 - of downloads now for this specific
07:54 - client he had over 15 million downloads
07:57 - in the app store already and so this is
08:00 - something we leverage in our social
08:02 - proof one of the bullet points in our
08:03 - email is going to be hey Jared has over
08:05 - 15,000 15 million downloads across his
08:08 - past apps and that allows to see that
08:11 - gives Apple a clue on like oh this app
08:13 - must be worth checking out also another
08:16 - thing that you might want to think about
08:18 - is your pass did you work for a big
08:20 - company a big game company what other
08:23 - companies that you can leverage you know
08:25 - a lot of headlines or X Google X Apple X
08:29 - PayPal right these are all you
08:32 - leveraging social proof from the past so
08:34 - if it's an X Apple right it's and I'm
08:37 - Apple I'm more likely to look at that
08:39 - email and see all right who's this
08:41 - person do I know this person what have
08:43 - they created the other thing that you
08:47 - should put in there are you using any
08:50 - new Apple features
08:51 - so as a at the time of this recording
08:54 - there's a new iOS update did you use any
08:57 - of those new features that you can
08:59 - highlight in your pitch Apple loves
09:01 - between apps that are capitalizing on
09:04 - some of the new features that they just
09:05 - release so iOS updates or Apple new
09:08 - features that they have an iPhone these
09:10 - are things that you have to leverage to
09:12 - get their attention all right and you
09:14 - can even put it in your update notes so
09:17 - if a new app putting your update notes
09:18 - or if into the release notes put it in
09:20 - there about what this app is featuring
09:22 - okay it's a great way right you can get
09:25 - our you viewer that says oh my goodness
09:26 - like they're utilizing this new feature
09:28 - it's a great way to get get their
09:30 - attention next thing is you got to keep
09:33 - it short I get a ton of pitches too
09:34 - because the podcast but you really
09:37 - really really have to keep it short okay
09:39 - so like I said about social proof put on
09:42 - sentence in there about social proof why
09:44 - the app is different of video and any
09:47 - new Apple features you want to keep it
09:48 - really really really really really short
09:50 - and I like to use bullets to break
09:52 - things up and so here's why this app is
09:54 - cool bullet one bullet two bullet three
09:56 - by that's it you know think of it like a
09:58 - resume how you would format a resume you
10:00 - want to make it so that it's kimmel
10:01 - skimmable and did the email is alright
10:04 - so keep it short number three or the
10:07 - last one is ask for feedback ask the app
10:11 - store manager for feedback on the app
10:12 - you know the saying that if you ask for
10:14 - advice you get money and if you ask for
10:16 - money you get advice same true same
10:19 - holds true here when you ask for
10:21 - feedback you get more like they're gonna
10:23 - be behind you I'm sure they get a lot of
10:25 - pitches right and so it's best to ask
10:27 - for feedback if you're just starting out
10:29 - and I Kayla this my new app I'm so
10:31 - excited about it and I know you see a
10:32 - ton of apps I'd love your thoughts just
10:34 - like two second thoughts on what you
10:36 - think I can improve on the app and you
10:38 - can do wonders for that all right so to
10:42 - summarize what you should include in
10:44 - your Apple and your pitch to Apple video
10:47 - include a short little video of your app
10:49 - in action social proof if you have any
10:51 - leverage that I mean even me I leverage
10:54 - the fact that I've interviewed over 350
10:56 - awesome app developers including the
10:59 - cofounders of Shazam 3 bot so if clear
11:02 - you know that's me leveraging social
11:04 - proof
11:05 - right so you can find it just look for
11:07 - it any new Apple features that you have
11:09 - in the app that you incorporating the
11:11 - app you keep it short and then ask for
11:13 - feedback if all else fails just ask for
11:15 - feedback all right so once you email
11:20 - them if all works out you'll get a reply
11:23 - back and they'll say hey can you fill
11:26 - out these forms and it's gonna be like
11:27 - an Excel spreadsheet and send over some
11:30 - designs
11:30 - that's when now nothing's still
11:32 - guaranteed at this point but your
11:34 - chances of being featured are very very
11:36 - high because what they want to do is see
11:38 - what features are using what is it
11:40 - compatible with and then any design
11:43 - elements that they're asking you for so
11:45 - banners icons whatever they need make
11:48 - sure you get to them quickly
11:49 - all right and so what if everything
11:52 - works out you get a reply and people
11:53 - forward it on to different people and
11:55 - then they'll ask you to fill out some
11:56 - forms and send over some designs now
12:02 - that you sent over some designs here's
12:04 - what you got to do Thursday every
12:06 - Thursday the App Store refreshes okay
12:09 - every 30 day the App Store refreshes so
12:12 - on Thursday make sure you go into the
12:14 - App Store and then you look at the
12:17 - different categories so here's a example
12:20 - that I'm gonna give you sorry I was
12:22 - poking around but you go to the App
12:24 - Store in iTunes and you go to the
12:27 - different categories so if your app
12:28 - doesn't make it into the main App Store
12:32 - this is the main app store front page
12:35 - right with all the new apps and all the
12:38 - best new games and this feature if it
12:39 - doesn't make it there then I recommend
12:42 - checking out the different categories so
12:44 - you go to all categories if your app is
12:47 - under game click there and then also
12:51 - look at the different sub categories
12:53 - that you may have submitted so when you
12:55 - submit to game they ask you for this sub
12:57 - category and I'm gonna show you this is
13:01 - actually where we were featured my
13:03 - client best new games and here it's
13:05 - great right drove great number of
13:08 - downloads this is where my other client
13:09 - is now being featured auctioneer right
13:12 - they said over a banner and this is
13:15 - where their Apple is using their batter
13:18 - and so this app happens to be on the
13:21 - front page too but if your app doesn't
13:23 - you if you smooth the designs you
13:25 - submitted the templates their
13:26 - spreadsheet and it doesn't make the
13:27 - homepage don't fear you can possibly get
13:31 - featured in the specific categories so
13:34 - make sure you go into the category
13:35 - here's my client right here best new
13:37 - games but that's a way to do it and the
13:39 - last thing I'll leave you with is if you
13:41 - do get featured make sure you leverage
13:43 - that feature right you can go out to
13:46 - some of these publications again in your
13:49 - PR pitch and say hey look I just been
13:51 - featured by Apple check it out put a
13:53 - little screenshot to show the social
13:55 - proof that you did do it and leverage
13:57 - that for even more press write even more
14:00 - coverage get you the downloads that
14:02 - people may not it's not everybody US app
14:05 - developers I'm in there every Thursday
14:06 - just checking out the new apps but not
14:08 - everybody's doing it and so it's a great
14:10 - way to leverage press publicity and get
14:13 - press by saying look I just been feature
14:15 - put that screenshot with the little
14:17 - arrow to your app alright and that's it
14:19 - that's a great way on how you can get
14:21 - featured through a cold email let us
14:24 - know what you think if you like this
14:26 - video put some comments below what's
14:28 - your favorite part and what are you
14:30 - gonna do maybe put in the link to your
14:31 - app so that we can check it out as well
14:32 - in the comments below again my name is
14:35 - Steve P Jung I'm at at masters Co this
14:39 - is a video exclusively for the code with
14:43 - Chris audience thanks guys

what is up YouTube and all the YouTube subscribers and Watchers of code with Chris I am NOT Chris but I am one of his friends my name is Steve P young and I'm the founder of app masters CO and in this video I'm going to show you how we help the client get featured by Apple through a cold email so stepbystep instructions on how to do that so here's the feature that we're able to help our client land

the mobile space come on to tell their story and you can actually hear Chris's episode in the links below this video if you want to check it out what a great guest Chris did and if you just started out and you can hear how he all started and I was able to use code with Chris to eventually leave his job but for about me I started the app business in 2011 I have over 30 plus apps on the podcast app master scope I've interviewed over 350 amazing app entrepreneurs from the biggest biggest names the cofounder of Shazam Yahoo weather Paul had died from tweet bought all the biggest apps in the world have at least done their interview on a pastor so go check it out and then I've been known for recently getting publicity on helping plants get publicity on some major blogs I more VentureBeat The Next Web touch arcade tech cocktail and many many more so you can all check it out if you want to at masters dot Co is the website and now on to the content well let's say you want to get featured by Apple you made a great looking app it's well done you spent months and months listening to code with Chris to figure out how to actually implement every little thing to make it so polish and now you want to get it out into the masses and you want to get featured by Apple it's the holy grail for us app developers well I'm gonna show you step by step how to do that through a cold email step one make a great app I know I'm being Captain Obvious here but it's so true not all apps are going to get featured by Apple they want to highlight the best apps in the App space and Apple they are good about making sure that they care about their consumers right they care about their customers so they want to highlight apps that really highlight the Apple brand well and so make sure you've done all your legwork you'll listen to all of Chris's videos and you made a really really good looking out make sure it's designed well as well yes I know it's obvious so I wanted to highlight the fact that yes it's obvious but I think it's worth stating to please make sure you made a good app okay number two and here's the real cool thing about it find the right contact person at Apple now that's really easy I'm gonna show you how to do that right now now the apps are so huge right there's thousands of thousands of new apps coming out every single day and what you have to find is the right app store manager at Apple there are app store managers that cater to a specific category so here's what you do put app store manager into the search field oh I'm actually on LinkedIn so go to linkedin.com and look search for App Store Manager okay and I'm gonna hide everybody's info because I don't want you seeing everything but what you want to do is make sure you go down here and you pick Apple as the current company and then what you want to look for is the app store manager for your specific category okay and so just make sure there's a ton right you can see here that there are a few that cater to games there's gonna be you that cater to education there's a few that's gonna cater to whatever category you're trying to get into just make sure you find the right person for that now that you found the right person to contact what you want to do next is find the email address I know it seems pretty obvious let me show you a dead simple way on how to do that so I'm gonna go back to my screen I'm using Google Chrome right now and go to a site called email hunter CO email hunter CO and I'm using Google Chrome so I installed the email hunter for Chrome extension that you can see right here now what you want to do here I'll click it just so you can see it but it says email hunter for Chrome and this adds this little button right here so if you're on somebody else's domain so if you're on at masters CO or if I'm code with Chris calm and you really want to find out Chris's email address you can click this little button right here and it'll give you all the email addresses that are related to that domain really handy tool right but I love it too because it actually adds a button on to LinkedIn profiles I'm not going to show you the email addresses of the Apple contacts because I don't want to expose them but I'm going to show you that when you have the email hunter tool installed and you're on LinkedIn you get this handy button and even if you're trying to target anybody I don't like leads or anybody else maybe even a journalist you can click that button it'll give you the email address of that person I've found the email address of the Apple App Store manager using this exact process so email hunter is the tool to use number four the next step after you found the right person you have their email address it's time to write a compelling email so what's that involved it takes a lot of time I've done it a lot and it takes a lot of time to really figure out so it's gonna take some practice and I would say ask your friends ask your network to see what they think of your email and make sure you get it right ok you want to get the first one right so here's some things to include in your email this is what we do really well number one have a video keep it short sixty seconds show the general gameplay of your app so whether it's a game or if it's an app like a Productivity app just show the general use of the app doesn't have to be high quality but the more high quality you can get it the better it is because literally four reporters and four Apple employees less important for the Apple employees but definitely important when you're reaching out for the press the quality of your app will be used to judge the quality I'm sorry let me rephrase this the quality of your video would be used to judge the quality of your app so if you have a really bad video they're gonna think that you have a really bad app right now for when you're pitching Apple it's gonna be ok because they understand that it's just a general gameplay and they want to show them what the app is all about rather than tell them so it's always better to show them if you can include a video do it you have to have it number two this is one thing I think most people forget about is to leverage social proof so things to think about when you're trying to think about social proof like Steve what is social proof well have any of your apps been featured that's one thing right if I haven't featured why am i watching this video okay I get you I get you but just in case it has make sure you make it known do you have millions of downloads now for this specific client he had over 15 million downloads in the app store already and so this is something we leverage in our social proof one of the bullet points in our email is going to be hey Jared has over 15,000 15 million downloads across his past apps and that allows to see that gives Apple a clue on like oh this app must be worth checking out also another thing that you might want to think about is your pass did you work for a big company a big game company what other companies that you can leverage you know a lot of headlines or X Google X Apple X PayPal right these are all you leveraging social proof from the past so if it's an X Apple right it's and I'm Apple I'm more likely to look at that email and see all right who's this person do I know this person what have they created the other thing that you should put in there are you using any new Apple features so as a at the time of this recording there's a new iOS update did you use any of those new features that you can highlight in your pitch Apple loves between apps that are capitalizing on some of the new features that they just release so iOS updates or Apple new features that they have an iPhone these are things that you have to leverage to get their attention all right and you can even put it in your update notes so if a new app putting your update notes or if into the release notes put it in there about what this app is featuring okay it's a great way right you can get our you viewer that says oh my goodness like they're utilizing this new feature it's a great way to get get their attention next thing is you got to keep it short I get a ton of pitches too because the podcast but you really really really have to keep it short okay so like I said about social proof put on sentence in there about social proof why the app is different of video and any new Apple features you want to keep it really really really really really short and I like to use bullets to break things up and so here's why this app is cool bullet one bullet two bullet three by that's it you know think of it like a resume how you would format a resume you want to make it so that it's kimmel skimmable and did the email is alright so keep it short number three or the last one is ask for feedback ask the app store manager for feedback on the app you know the saying that if you ask for advice you get money and if you ask for money you get advice same true same holds true here when you ask for feedback you get more like they're gonna be behind you I'm sure they get a lot of pitches right and so it's best to ask for feedback if you're just starting out and I Kayla this my new app I'm so excited about it and I know you see a ton of apps I'd love your thoughts just like two second thoughts on what you think I can improve on the app and you can do wonders for that all right so to summarize what you should include in your Apple and your pitch to Apple video include a short little video of your app in action social proof if you have any leverage that I mean even me I leverage the fact that I've interviewed over 350 awesome app developers including the cofounders of Shazam 3 bot so if clear you know that's me leveraging social proof right so you can find it just look for it any new Apple features that you have in the app that you incorporating the app you keep it short and then ask for feedback if all else fails just ask for feedback all right so once you email them if all works out you'll get a reply back and they'll say hey can you fill out these forms and it's gonna be like an Excel spreadsheet and send over some designs that's when now nothing's still guaranteed at this point but your chances of being featured are very very high because what they want to do is see what features are using what is it compatible with and then any design elements that they're asking you for so banners icons whatever they need make sure you get to them quickly all right and so what if everything works out you get a reply and people forward it on to different people and then they'll ask you to fill out some forms and send over some designs now that you sent over some designs here's what you got to do Thursday every Thursday the App Store refreshes okay every 30 day the App Store refreshes so on Thursday make sure you go into the App Store and then you look at the different categories so here's a example that I'm gonna give you sorry I was poking around but you go to the App Store in iTunes and you go to the different categories so if your app doesn't make it into the main App Store this is the main app store front page right with all the new apps and all the best new games and this feature if it doesn't make it there then I recommend checking out the different categories so you go to all categories if your app is under game click there and then also look at the different sub categories that you may have submitted so when you submit to game they ask you for this sub category and I'm gonna show you this is actually where we were featured my client best new games and here it's great right drove great number of downloads this is where my other client is now being featured auctioneer right they said over a banner and this is where their Apple is using their batter and so this app happens to be on the front page too but if your app doesn't you if you smooth the designs you submitted the templates their spreadsheet and it doesn't make the homepage don't fear you can possibly get featured in the specific categories so make sure you go into the category here's my client right here best new games but that's a way to do it and the last thing I'll leave you with is if you do get featured make sure you leverage that feature right you can go out to some of these publications again in your PR pitch and say hey look I just been featured by Apple check it out put a little screenshot to show the social proof that you did do it and leverage that for even more press write even more coverage get you the downloads that people may not it's not everybody US app developers I'm in there every Thursday just checking out the new apps but not everybody's doing it and so it's a great way to leverage press publicity and get press by saying look I just been feature put that screenshot with the little arrow to your app alright and that's it that's a great way on how you can get featured through a cold email let us know what you think if you like this video put some comments below what's your favorite part and what are you gonna do maybe put in the link to your app so that we can check it out as well in the comments below again my name is Steve P Jung I'm at at masters Co this is a video exclusively for the code with Chris audience thanks guys
