00:00 - hello and welcome to the lesson to
00:01 - exercise now if you haven't checked out
00:04 - the beginner series yet I would highly
00:06 - recommend that you do that because this
00:08 - exercise is specifically intended to be
00:11 - done after you've completed lesson two
00:14 - so go ahead and check out the beginner
00:16 - series either in the link in the
00:17 - description below or check up in the
00:20 - upper right corner so this is what
00:22 - you're going to be completing as part of
00:25 - this exercise now have all of the image
00:27 - assets that you need for download just
00:29 - below the video so go ahead and grab
00:31 - those assets fire up a brand new single
00:34 - view application Xcode project and using
00:37 - what you've learned to try to put this
00:38 - together so at this point what I do is
00:40 - just pause the video and try this out
00:42 - for yourself if you get stuck something
00:44 - doesn't look right you can't get
00:46 - something looking the way you want then
00:47 - come back and watch this video from this
00:49 - point on because from here on out I'm
00:51 - going to be building this and showing
00:54 - you how to do it
00:55 - [Applause]
00:59 - [Music]
01:01 - so here I've started a brand new Xcode
01:04 - project I'm going to choose single view
01:06 - app and let's call this a lesson 2
01:09 - exercise solution and you know all of
01:14 - this stuff is fine I mean all we're
01:16 - doing is customizing how it looks in the
01:20 - storyboard so we're gonna be working in
01:24 - the storyboard here the first thing to
01:27 - do though is grab those image assets and
01:29 - put them into your asset library so I've
01:32 - actually got them right here
01:33 - so I'm just gonna grab them all and put
01:36 - them in so let's just take a look at
01:39 - what we have we have this breakfast
01:41 - image which is from pixels comm and I've
01:45 - got the icon and then I've got a
01:49 - gradient for the bottom and the gradient
01:51 - for the top now gradients can actually
01:53 - be done you don't have to use image
01:56 - assets but at this point in your iOS
01:59 - journey this is probably the easiest way
02:01 - for you to do it so I'm gonna start here
02:05 - by first putting in that big breakfast
02:09 - image let's open up the object library
02:13 - and choose image view and if you don't
02:16 - remember the shortcut key just click on
02:18 - this icon up here we're gonna add the
02:22 - image view so let's also stretch it out
02:25 - to all four sides we're going to uncheck
02:28 - constrain to margins because we want it
02:30 - to be to the very edge and we're also
02:32 - going to make sure that each of these
02:34 - margins that we're specifying is
02:37 - relative to the view and not the safe
02:44 - area and then we're going to proceed to
02:46 - set them all to zero so let's go ahead
02:49 - and add these four constraints and then
02:52 - set the image for this guy to our
02:55 - breakfast now just in case it's a little
02:58 - bit stretched change the content mode
03:01 - from scale to fill which is the default
03:04 - two aspect fill and that's going to
03:06 - maintain the proper aspect ratio while
03:09 - filling up the space of the uiimageview
03:11 - you can see that it looks
03:13 - a little bright we're gonna add our
03:15 - gradients now so again open up your
03:18 - object library and just put an image
03:19 - down there like that and this time we're
03:22 - going to add three constraints left
03:25 - right and top and this is going to be
03:27 - that top gradient so I'm going to go
03:29 - ahead and open this guy up
03:31 - uncheck constrain to margins again
03:33 - enable the three and then I'm going to
03:36 - make sure that it's relative to the view
03:39 - so it goes to the very edge because we
03:45 - want it to be at the very edge and not
03:47 - it doesn't matter if it's obscured by
03:49 - the battery indicator or the time or the
03:52 - notch or anything like that and so
03:54 - that's why we specify this relative to
03:56 - the view and not the safe area all right
03:59 - so we get some constraint errors but
04:01 - let's set the image first so we're gonna
04:04 - choose top gradient and that is going to
04:08 - that's going to look okay like that
04:10 - we're gonna add a second image view and
04:13 - put it near the bottom right here and
04:14 - this one's going to be the bottom
04:16 - gradient and we're going to set the left
04:17 - right and bottom constraints for this
04:20 - guy so same exact thing uncheck
04:23 - constraint margins we're going to enable
04:24 - these three and then we're going to
04:26 - choose relative to the view okay now
04:31 - let's set these guys go zero and then
04:33 - click add three constraints then we're
04:36 - going to set the image to bottom
04:37 - gradient so we get something like that
04:39 - now the next step is to add the icon
04:43 - first so again we're going to be adding
04:46 - another image view like that and I'm
04:49 - going to set the image to heart health
04:53 - and then I'm going to add a top and
04:58 - right margin and this time I'm going to
05:00 - leave this on and I'm going to leave it
05:04 - relative to the safe area I'm gonna say
05:07 - oops
05:08 - I don't want it add constraint just the
05:11 - left and the right sorry the top and the
05:14 - right let's add these two and we've got
05:16 - our little icon there
05:18 - alright we're nearly there so let's add
05:21 - our label right here and this one let's
05:25 - just change the text to white first
05:27 - so we can actually see what it's saying
05:28 - and then we are going to leave
05:32 - constraint margins on I'm going to do
05:34 - left and top and we're going to do 20
05:37 - and 20 and again this is by default
05:40 - relative to the safe area so we know
05:43 - that this label isn't going to get
05:44 - blocked by anything so let's add these
05:47 - two constraints right there
05:48 - and we're gonna set the toast to I think
05:51 - it was hardcore above toast and then
05:55 - we're going to click this font and let's
05:59 - just make it a little bigger I forget
06:00 - exactly what size I used but let's say
06:05 - 30 and I think actually I had a custom
06:07 - font so I used that you can choose
06:10 - anything you want it doesn't really
06:12 - matter I'm going to choose a veneer next
06:15 - deme bold and just do 40 oh that's way
06:19 - too big 30 all right and what you can do
06:26 - at this point if you want it to wrap to
06:27 - two lines you can change your number of
06:31 - length is zero which just means multi
06:34 - lines and you can actually either set a
06:38 - width so if you set a width say cutting
06:40 - it off right here at the point at the a
06:43 - it's going to automatically wrap a vote
06:46 - oast to the next line or you can change
06:49 - your text and you can manually specify a
06:51 - line break so hold down control and hit
06:55 - enter like that to create a double line
06:59 - label you just hit enter
07:00 - so you've got that and we're gonna add
07:04 - another label this time down here and
07:08 - let's set this font to white and we're
07:12 - going to make this label cling on to the
07:18 - left the right and the bottom and just
07:22 - say 20 20 and 20 and again let's make
07:28 - this a multi-line label by setting the
07:31 - number of lines to zero and I forget
07:34 - exactly what text I had but let me just
07:37 - write something here
07:38 - this breakfast is so healthy and will
07:45 - give you so much energy that you'll be
07:50 - able to accomplish anything today
07:55 - [Applause]
07:56 - actually I don't think I had this much
07:59 - text in in the version I showed you but
08:01 - it's fine so you know even though I
08:05 - might not have chose the exact font size
08:08 - and the exact font that I used in the
08:12 - demo that I showed you in the beginning
08:13 - of the video you kind of get the idea
08:15 - about how to build this UI so I hope you
08:18 - were able to do it on your own if not I
08:20 - hope you're able to do it after watching
08:22 - this I would give it another try if you
08:25 - got stuck just so you can get some extra
08:28 - practice and because it's really once
08:30 - you start doing it you're going to then
08:32 - realize what you don't know if you're
08:34 - just watching me you don't know what you
08:36 - don't know right so definitely give it a
08:38 - try all right I'll see you in the next
08:40 - one

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to the lesson to exercise now if you haven't checked out the beginner series yet I would highly recommend that you do that because this exercise is specifically intended to be done after you've completed lesson two so go ahead and check out the beginner series either in the link in the description below or check up in the upper right corner so this is what you're going to be completing as part of this exercise now have all of the image assets that you need for download just below the video so go ahead and grab those assets fire up a brand new single view application Xcode project and using what you've learned to try to put this together so at this point what I do is just pause the video and try this out for yourself if you get stuck something doesn't look right you can't get something looking the way you want then come back and watch this video from this point on because from here on out I'm going to be building this and showing you how to do it so here I've started a brand new Xcode project I'm going to choose single view app and let's call this a lesson 2 exercise solution and you know all of this stuff is fine I mean all we're doing is customizing how it looks in the storyboard so we're gonna be working in the storyboard here the first thing to do though is grab those image assets and put them into your asset library so I've actually got them right here so I'm just gonna grab them all and put them in so let's just take a look at what we have we have this breakfast image which is from pixels comm and I've got the icon and then I've got a gradient for the bottom and the gradient for the top now gradients can actually be done you don't have to use image assets but at this point in your iOS journey this is probably the easiest way for you to do it so I'm gonna start here by first putting in that big breakfast image let's open up the object library and choose image view and if you don't remember the shortcut key just click on this icon up here we're gonna add the image view so let's also stretch it out to all four sides we're going to uncheck constrain to margins because we want it to be to the very edge and we're also going to make sure that each of these margins that we're specifying is relative to the view and not the safe area and then we're going to proceed to set them all to zero so let's go ahead and add these four constraints and then set the image for this guy to our breakfast now just in case it's a little bit stretched change the content mode from scale to fill which is the default two aspect fill and that's going to maintain the proper aspect ratio while filling up the space of the uiimageview you can see that it looks a little bright we're gonna add our gradients now so again open up your object library and just put an image down there like that and this time we're going to add three constraints left right and top and this is going to be that top gradient so I'm going to go ahead and open this guy up uncheck constrain to margins again enable the three and then I'm going to make sure that it's relative to the view so it goes to the very edge because we want it to be at the very edge and not it doesn't matter if it's obscured by the battery indicator or the time or the notch or anything like that and so that's why we specify this relative to the view and not the safe area all right so we get

enable these three and then we're going to choose relative to the view okay now let's set these guys go zero and then click add three constraints then we're going to set the image to bottom gradient so we get something like that now the next step is to add the icon first so again we're going to be adding another image view like that and I'm going to set the image to heart health and then I'm going to add a top and right margin and this time I'm going to leave this on and I'm going to leave it relative to the safe area I'm gonna say oops I don't want it add constraint just the left and the
