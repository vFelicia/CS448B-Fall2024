00:05 - hey coders what's up it's Chris and I'm
00:08 - here with episode 6 of how to make a
00:10 - youtube video app in the previous lesson
00:13 - we had gone through downloading the
00:16 - video thumbnail for our videos and
00:18 - displaying them in the cells of the UI
00:21 - tableview in this lesson we're going to
00:23 - display the labels so as you can see
00:26 - here we have a variable called video
00:27 - title or a constant rather because the
00:30 - let keyword is used and we've got the
00:33 - video title for the video that the
00:35 - tableview is asking for and right now
00:38 - we're not doing anything with it so
00:39 - Xcode is giving us a warning here so
00:41 - let's go ahead and go into our
00:43 - storyboard and add a label to our cell
00:46 - so down here I'm gonna search for UI
00:48 - label that and I'm just gonna drag it
00:53 - into here our cell in the content view
00:57 - right here in the document outline make
00:58 - sure that your label is on top of your
01:01 - image view which means that it's
01:03 - actually underneath it in this document
01:06 - outline because otherwise if it's like
01:09 - this then the image view will be
01:11 - covering the label so you want to make
01:12 - sure that it's like that next we're
01:15 - gonna add some constraints to the label
01:17 - so make sure your label is click to go
01:20 - down here click this guy uncheck
01:23 - constrain to margins and I'm gonna do
01:25 - left right and bottom so I want to
01:28 - anchor it I want to give it a left
01:30 - margin because if you do zero then the
01:32 - text is gonna start right at the edge of
01:34 - the label so I'm going to put 20 and on
01:38 - the right side 20 so it matches and on
01:40 - the bottom I'm going to put 0 and as for
01:43 - height oops
01:44 - make sure that that doesn't change on
01:46 - you so Presi row tab I'm gonna add a
01:51 - high constraint as well and for this guy
01:53 - I'm going to put 80 just to eyeball it
01:56 - and then I'm gonna press tab again and
01:59 - add these four constraints now let's
02:01 - update frames so we can see our label is
02:06 - there okay and in order to access it
02:10 - from the cell for Rohit in
02:12 - path method we're gonna give this guy a
02:14 - tag but it has to be a different tag
02:17 - than our image view so remember if I
02:19 - click the image view we can see that the
02:21 - tag is one we're gonna retrieve the
02:23 - label with a tag of by default zero I'm
02:28 - gonna put two okay so now let's jump
02:30 - back to the view controller so we've got
02:33 - our video title here in the cell for row
02:36 - at index path method and we're not doing
02:38 - anything with it so let's go ahead and
02:42 - write some comments get the label for
02:45 - the prototype cell or just right cell so
02:50 - let label equals cell view with tag and
02:55 - we pass in two and now we got a tell
02:57 - Xcode it's a label so we're gonna use as
03:00 - exclamation mark UI label and now we're
03:04 - simply going to set the text property of
03:06 - that label so label dot text equals
03:10 - video title now let's run it and see
03:13 - what we get okay so we do see the labels
03:19 - here and you can see the longer ones
03:21 - actually get cut off so we need to make
03:23 - our label multiple lines and also I
03:27 - wanted to put a black view underneath so
03:30 - that the text really pops so let's go
03:33 - ahead and do that let's go into the
03:35 - storyboard click the label I'm gonna
03:38 - change the color to white and then I'm
03:42 - going to click this font choose custom
03:46 - and I'm gonna just set it as bold so it
03:49 - stands out a little more and we need to
03:52 - make it multiple lines so for the number
03:53 - of lines just press the down arrow here
03:56 - to put it to zero or you can just type
03:58 - in the zero so now let's run it and see
04:01 - how it looks okay so now we have white
04:05 - text which is even harder to see but
04:07 - we're gonna put that black background on
04:09 - it and you can see now it splits it into
04:11 - two lines okay so let's go ahead go back
04:14 - to our storyboard and search for UI view
04:16 - here I'm gonna drag a view into the cell
04:21 - but in here make sure that the view is
04:25 - behind the
04:26 - or also the view will be blocking the
04:27 - label so make sure it's image view and
04:30 - then the view and then the label so for
04:33 - the view I'm gonna change it into a
04:35 - black color and let's add some
04:38 - constraints on this video so click the
04:40 - view I view go down here and uncheck
04:43 - constraint margins I'm going to add left
04:45 - right and bottom margins so this one I
04:48 - do want it to the edge of the cell zero
04:51 - zero zero okay for height we're gonna
04:55 - put 80 because that's what we put for
04:57 - the label I add four constraints update
05:02 - frames now let's run it to see how that
05:05 - looks okay so the view is in the place
05:09 - we want but it'd be nice to add a little
05:10 - transparency to that so we can go back
05:13 - to the storyboard and click the View you
05:15 - can either change the transparency here
05:19 - to 0.5 to make it a little dimmer or
05:22 - there's another way you can leave the
05:25 - Alpha as one but you can click the
05:27 - background color and it out pops this
05:30 - color and you can change the actual
05:33 - color to be a 50% opacity black so the
05:37 - difference is that in this case because
05:39 - our view doesn't contain any elements it
05:42 - doesn't matter what which of these two
05:43 - techniques that we choose but for
05:46 - example if the view actually contained
05:48 - some elements then setting the Alpha
05:51 - would also change all of the Alpha
05:54 - values for all of the elements inside
05:56 - the view I mean it wouldn't actually
05:58 - change the Alpha values for the elements
06:00 - inside the view but they would all
06:01 - appear dimmed simply because the parent
06:04 - container itself is dimmed so if you had
06:07 - elements inside the view and you merely
06:10 - wanted the background color to be
06:12 - transparent then you would do this way
06:15 - by clicking the background color and
06:17 - simply changing the color itself to 50%
06:20 - but if you wanted all of the elements
06:22 - inside your UI view to also be
06:25 - semi-transparent then you would change
06:26 - this alpha value so just a quick tip for
06:29 - the future okay so now let's run it
06:31 - again and take a look at the faded label
06:35 - okay so that looks good
06:38 - so in this video we're also gonna try
06:40 - something cool because in the previous
06:42 - episode 5 there was a comment left by
06:45 - strange productions and letting me know
06:49 - that there is a way to get the maximum
06:50 - quality thumbnails so this is the string
06:54 - max res default jpg so let's give that a
06:58 - try
06:59 - thank you strange productions for
07:00 - watching and letting us know that let's
07:03 - go with the view controller and let's
07:06 - change that instead of MQ default its
07:08 - max res default right let's just confirm
07:12 - that max res default jpg so let's run it
07:16 - oh yeah that looks amazing I don't know
07:21 - if you guys can tell the difference but
07:22 - I definitely can right here thank you so
07:25 - much strange reductions that's amazing
07:28 - it looks so much better
07:29 - awesome ok so it was a shorter video
07:33 - today thanks for watching if you enjoyed
07:35 - the lesson please share it with your
07:37 - colleagues and friends share it on
07:39 - social media helped me build more
07:41 - subscribers on YouTube and make sure you
07:43 - subscribe and like yourself and I will
07:46 - see you guys tomorrow at 12 okay take
07:48 - care guys bye bye

hey coders what's up it's Chris and I'm here with episode 6 of how to make a youtube video app in the previous lesson we had gone through downloading the video thumbnail for our videos and displaying
