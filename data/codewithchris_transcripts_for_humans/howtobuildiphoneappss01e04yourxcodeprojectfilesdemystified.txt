00:00 - hey guys welcome to episode 4 of how to
00:03 - build your first iPhone app it's been a
00:05 - while since my last video approximately
00:07 - 20 days so I really apologize for that
00:10 - it's kind of been crazy at work and the
00:13 - good news however is that at the end of
00:16 - this week I will be taking some time off
00:18 - from work and I plan on frequently
00:22 - updating and creating more videos for
00:25 - you guys to enjoy I've really loved the
00:27 - feedback that I've gotten from you guys
00:29 - the comments and the encouragement and
00:33 - the support that stuff really helps keep
00:36 - me going because I know there's people
00:37 - watching and people enjoying these
00:40 - videos and so that helps keep me
00:42 - motivated to keep creating these for you
00:45 - so please participate comment like my
00:49 - videos and show me some support
00:51 - it really helps ok so without further
00:54 - ado what is this episode about so in
00:58 - this episode we're going to actually go
01:00 - back to that Xcode project we created in
01:04 - tutorial video 1 and if you don't know
01:07 - what I'm talking about just go back to
01:09 - video 1 and you can see how we've
01:11 - created this in Xcode so we're gonna go
01:14 - back to that Xcode project and we're
01:17 - gonna take a look at the files that
01:18 - Xcode created for us and I'm gonna show
01:23 - you what those files represent kind of
01:26 - tying back to the previous lesson on
01:28 - model-view-controller so you guys can
01:30 - get an idea of how the app navigation
01:32 - architecture is gonna work
01:34 - ok so let's open up that project and
01:38 - what I want to note for you guys is on
01:42 - this left-hand side right here under
01:45 - this iPhone app tutorial I want you guys
01:49 - to notice what files are here so we've
01:51 - got something called the app delegate
01:54 - we've also got view controller H and M
01:58 - and I'll explain what those mean
01:59 - probably in the next video it's gonna
02:02 - become really important to start
02:04 - learning what that is but for now know
02:06 - that there's an app delegate and there's
02:08 - a view controller and then there's
02:09 - another view controller dot zip file
02:13 - and now let me bring up my PowerPoint
02:16 - slide so I can illustrate to you guys
02:18 - visually what those files represent okay
02:25 - so to draw it visually I think it's much
02:28 - easier to understand kind of in this
02:30 - format and so on the left-hand side here
02:34 - I've got your an iPhone app this could
02:38 - be any application and this would still
02:40 - hold true this diagram and think of the
02:45 - app delegate as kind of the entryway to
02:47 - your application in the app delegate
02:49 - your app gets set up there's like app
02:52 - launching methods and you know all sorts
02:55 - of plumbing that's going on and getting
02:57 - set up and what happens is at the end of
03:00 - that it sets your first view which
03:03 - becomes visible to the user and so the
03:07 - app delegate references something called
03:09 - the view controller and this is
03:11 - something that we talked about in the
03:13 - last video in the MVC your view
03:15 - controller would be the C part of that
03:18 - right and if you recall that diagram the
03:23 - C communicates with the V which is the
03:26 - view and that's represented by the zip
03:29 - file that we saw in the Xcode project
03:30 - and in the Xcode project we did not have
03:34 - a model you didn't see anything like
03:35 - that because when you create your Xcode
03:37 - project it wouldn't know what your data
03:41 - would be modeled like or anything like
03:43 - that so it doesn't create that for you
03:46 - but it does create your app delegate
03:48 - view controller and view controller dot
03:50 - zip file so let me go back to the slide
03:54 - for the last video just to refresh your
03:58 - memory we have Model View controller so
04:01 - you can see that the model represents
04:03 - your data and your business rules for
04:05 - your data and the controller is
04:07 - responsible for taking that data and
04:10 - communicating with the view so if we go
04:16 - back to this slide you can see how that
04:19 - MVC design pattern represents itself
04:24 - into these files in your X
04:26 - a project structure so you see the green
04:31 - orange and purple I've tried to match it
04:33 - up with this now this represents a
04:39 - particular view in your application so
04:42 - say it's your home view now many
04:46 - applications most applications actually
04:49 - have more than one view right you can
04:51 - navigate from screen to screen
04:53 - performing whatever it is that the app
04:55 - does so if this view controller this
05:00 - view controller zip in this model
05:02 - represents one view then how do we kind
05:05 - of go from view to view and there's in
05:07 - this next slide I've drawn a box around
05:10 - those three files kind of that
05:12 - represents a view so in the previous
05:15 - slide the app delegate points to a view
05:17 - controller and the view controller
05:19 - handles the communication between a
05:21 - certain model and a certain view and
05:23 - that represents a screen so if you had
05:26 - multiple screens basically it would look
05:30 - like something like this where your app
05:31 - delegate could point to any one of these
05:33 - view controllers and it would represent
05:35 - a different screen in a very kind of
05:38 - rudimentary sense
05:40 - so hopefully that puts into perspective
05:42 - what some of those files in Xcode mean
05:45 - so we'll always have one app delegate
05:47 - but we will create multiple view
05:51 - controllers who will create multiple
05:52 - models enough to represent our data
05:54 - we'll create multiple views or zip files
05:57 - and together that would create our app
06:02 - so in this video I wanted to tie what we
06:06 - learned in the last video about MVC into
06:10 - the actual Xcode project and I hope that
06:12 - I've done that properly so that you guys
06:15 - understand you know how the Model View
06:18 - controller pattern is represented in the
06:20 - iOS project now in the next video we're
06:23 - going to talk about well we're gonna
06:25 - actually we'll probably spend most of
06:27 - our time in Xcode starting to create the
06:30 - files and write the code that we need to
06:32 - finish our demo app and like I said
06:35 - please can the inten you to comment and
06:38 - like and subscribe if you haven't
06:40 - because I'm gonna be updating these
06:42 - videos much more frequently probably
06:45 - starting Friday when I get off work oh
06:47 - and I don't know if you guys noticed but
06:49 - I have a new logo so I actually spent
06:53 - the weekend revamping my site if you go
06:55 - to code with Chris comm you'll actually
06:57 - see it my new layout and I created a new
07:01 - logo for it so let me know what you
07:03 - think okay until the next video see you
07:06 - guys later bye

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to episode 4 of how to build your first iPhone app it's been a while since my last video approximately 20 days so I really apologize for that it's kind of been crazy at work and the good news however is that at the end of this week I will be taking some time off from work and I plan on frequently updating and creating more videos for you guys to enjoy I've really loved the feedback that I've gotten from you guys the comments and the encouragement and the support that stuff really helps keep me going because I know there's people watching and people enjoying these videos and so that helps keep me motivated to keep creating these for you so please participate comment like my videos and show me some support it really helps ok so without further ado what is this episode about so in this episode we're going to actually go back to that Xcode project we created in tutorial video 1 and if you don't know what I'm talking about just go back to video 1 and you can see how we've created this in Xcode so we're gonna go back to that Xcode project and we're gonna take a look at the files that Xcode created for us and I'm gonna show you what those files represent kind of tying back to the previous lesson on modelviewcontroller so you guys can get an idea of how the app navigation architecture is gonna work ok so let's open up that project and what I want to note for you guys is on this lefthand side right here under this iPhone app tutorial I want you guys to notice what files are here so we've got something called the app delegate we've also got view controller H and M and I'll explain what those mean probably in the next video it's gonna become really important to start learning what that is but for now know that there's an app delegate and there's a view controller and then there's another view controller dot zip file and now let me bring up my PowerPoint slide so I can illustrate to you guys visually what those files represent okay so to draw it visually I think it's much easier to understand kind of in this format and so on the lefthand side here I've got your an iPhone app this could be any application and this would still hold true this diagram and think of the app delegate as kind of the entryway to your application in the app delegate your app gets set up there's like app launching methods and you know all sorts of plumbing that's

applications most applications actually have more than one view right you can navigate from screen to screen performing whatever it is that the app does so if this view controller this view controller zip in this model represents one view then how do we kind of go from view to view and there's in this next slide I've drawn a box around those three files kind of that represents a view so in the
