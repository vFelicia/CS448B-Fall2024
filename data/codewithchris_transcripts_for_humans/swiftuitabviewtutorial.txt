00:00 - hi I'm Chris and in this video I'll show
00:01 - you how to use a swift joid tab view
00:04 - which will give you those nice tabs
00:05 - along the bottom so here I have a brand
00:08 - new xcode project and this is the
00:11 - default view let's start by changing the
00:14 - vstack into a tab view now notice that
00:19 - it is a layout container just like the
00:22 - vstack is and you essentially put the
00:25 - views inside of it that you want as
00:27 - separate tabs but it's not enough as you
00:30 - see we have an image and a text element
00:32 - inside the tab view but we don't have
00:34 - any tabs well what you're missing are
00:37 - modifiers called tab item on each of the
00:41 - elements so for example if I wanted to
00:43 - put this image in its own Tab and the
00:45 - text in its own tab I would add the tab
00:49 - item modifier to both of them so in this
00:52 - tab item modifier I would first of all
00:55 - let's
00:57 - add a text element to represent a tab as
01:00 - you can see in the preview we have tab
01:02 - two and that is going to be where my
01:05 - text element is uh going to reside now
01:09 - I'm going to add another tab item
01:10 - modifier to the image element and I'm
01:13 - going to call this tab one and now you
01:16 - get tab one and tab two and you can see
01:18 - in tab one I have the image if I click
01:20 - on tab two I get the text element now in
01:23 - truth you probably wouldn't put a single
01:25 - element inside a tab you would probably
01:29 - put a view consider consisting of many
01:30 - different things so feel free to create
01:33 - your own View and you can create an
01:36 - instance of that view here instead of
01:38 - using an image element and uh you could
01:41 - just add the tab item modifier to it to
01:44 - put that whole view into its own tab now
01:48 - for these tabs let's add an icon as well
01:51 - so I'm going to use SF symbols for this
01:54 - uh let's use plus I'm just going to use
01:55 - any random uh SF symbol just to
01:59 - demonstrate stra these just happen to be
02:02 - the ones that I remember off the top of
02:03 - my head so you can see we have two tabs
02:07 - just like that now if you want a third
02:08 - tab go ahead and create
02:12 - it like
02:19 - so and now we have three different tabs
02:24 - and that's how simple it is to use the
02:26 - tab view to create a tab bar in your app
02:29 - oh and one quick thing if you want to
02:31 - download the sample code for this we've
02:32 - got it all in a single handy xod project
02:35 - in fact it contains a sample code for
02:38 - all of the Swift UI components so that
02:40 - you can learn from it or copy and paste
02:41 - the code into your own project just
02:44 - visit
02:45 - cc. Swift ui- kit it's a free download
02:50 - I'll leave it in the description below
02:51 - the video too all right now back to the
02:53 - tutorial now some of you may be asking
02:56 - well how do we detect what tab is
02:59 - currently selling selected or how do I
03:01 - control through code which tab gets
03:03 - selected well in the tab view up here
03:06 - there's a parameter called selection and
03:09 - in order to use that we first have to
03:11 - create a state variable up
03:14 - here so let me demonstrate and we'll
03:17 - call this uh
03:19 - selected Tab and I'm going to initially
03:22 - set this to zero now uh now that we have
03:25 - a state property we can set the
03:28 - selection print parameter of the tab
03:30 - view to be a binding of that and that
03:34 - binding allows two-way read and write to
03:38 - this property that means that when the
03:40 - user interacts with the tab View and
03:42 - Taps on a tab it's going to relay that
03:44 - information and write it into the
03:46 - selected tab so that you can read this
03:48 - variable and see which tab is
03:50 - selected in the reverse way you can
03:54 - programmatically through code set the
03:56 - selected tab to a specific Tab and and
04:00 - then it will trigger that tab to become
04:02 - the active one there is one further step
04:06 - that we must do so in addition
04:09 - to just having that property and setting
04:13 - this binding you also have to add a tag
04:16 - modifier to each of the tabs so that you
04:19 - can identify and differentiate between
04:21 - the different tabs so let me show you
04:24 - that tag and I'm going to Simply you can
04:27 - use a string I'm going to use a number
04:30 - just so
04:31 - it's straightforward like
04:38 - that and so if I set the selected tab
04:42 - initially to one then when I launch this
04:46 - app this tab will get
04:50 - selected right that's the middle tab if
04:53 - I wanted to be
04:55 - that I could change it to
04:58 - that and then I'm going to run the code
05:01 - again and now by default this tab is
05:03 - selected now when I select a tab through
05:07 - the user interface like the user does
05:09 - this it is going to write whatever tag
05:13 - number this active tab is into that
05:16 - property so now that this tab one is
05:20 - selected selected tab is going to be a
05:23 - zero because the tag is zero for this
05:25 - tab one hopefully that makes sense
05:28 - that's how easy it is to detect which
05:31 - tab is selected as well as
05:32 - programmatically control which is the
05:35 - active tab so I hope you've enjoyed this
