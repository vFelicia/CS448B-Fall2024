00:00 - hey code crew what's up it's Chris here
00:02 - now this video is a little bit different
00:04 - from our usual videos where you see the
00:08 - backdrop in the back and that frames
00:10 - this is still the same room it's just
00:11 - that I'm not using the computer today
00:14 - because in this lesson I want to tell
00:16 - you about what we're going to be
00:18 - building in this series I realized that
00:20 - I haven't really talked about that all I
00:23 - told you in the previous lesson was that
00:26 - we're going to incorporate firebase
00:28 - authentication with a custom login UI
00:30 - and we're going to use fire store to
00:33 - store our data now those two things are
00:36 - true but I didn't just want to build a
00:40 - demo demonstrating those things I wanted
00:43 - to actually build a full-fledged app
00:45 - something that we could submit to the
00:47 - app store and that way it I think it's a
00:51 - lot more practical and you can also see
00:53 - things from end to end so today I'm
00:55 - gonna be talking about the app idea
00:58 - which we're going to be building now
01:00 - there was such a broad spectrum of
01:03 - things that I could do with only the
01:05 - requirements of authentication in
01:07 - storing data you're saying fire store
01:10 - literally any app that has login and has
01:13 - data so I really had a hard time
01:17 - thinking of an app idea that was not too
01:20 - big in scope and that wasn't too small
01:24 - that it would be too trivial and
01:25 - wouldn't be useful at all I went through
01:28 - a whole bunch of different ideas but
01:29 - every time I did that I just start
01:32 - adding more and more things and I know
01:35 - it would take a lot of time to build and
01:38 - the problem with that it's not that I
01:40 - don't want to show you guys how to build
01:42 - a really complex out it's just that
01:45 - those things would take a pretty long
01:48 - time and there is a high chance that I
01:51 - won't finish it because it's something
01:55 - that I struggle with and that is
01:58 - finishing projects so what I want to
02:01 - train myself to do is to not bite off
02:05 - more than I can chew is to be really
02:08 - specific about the feature set that I
02:10 - want to implement as
02:12 - v1 Minimum Viable Product and submitted
02:16 - to the App Store and get it out there
02:18 - and really go through that process and
02:20 - build up my habit of finishing my
02:24 - projects and shipping it and I think
02:28 - that's not something that's uncommon to
02:32 - a lot of people I think I you know game
02:35 - developers especially I know they have a
02:37 - lot of half-finished games or game
02:40 - prototypes lying around and they're
02:41 - notorious for having to build up this
02:44 - habit of completing their games and
02:47 - shipping it and so I have the same
02:49 - problem here with apps I want to build
02:51 - something that is small enough that I
02:53 - can publish now I can I can tell you
02:57 - some of the ideas that I did have I have
02:59 - this notebook that I just write in some
03:02 - of the time and just whenever I have an
03:04 - idea now the first idea I had was a poll
03:07 - app and that is basically the way I
03:10 - described it here in the book was a
03:12 - crowdsource a decision on you're
03:15 - undecided matters so I know a lot of the
03:18 - time especially if you've got a
03:21 - significant other they'll come to you
03:23 - and ask you oh should I wear this or
03:24 - that with hat and so you know me being
03:28 - so tired of answering those types of
03:30 - questions I'm not so much now but in
03:33 - more so in the past this app would
03:37 - basically allow the user to take two
03:39 - photos of two different decisions post
03:43 - it and have their friends kind of vote
03:45 - on it so that would be the poll part of
03:48 - it and my name that I thought of for
03:50 - that app was this or that so it's
03:53 - basically two simple decisions now I
03:55 - started going kind of out of hand with
03:57 - this because there's so much that you
03:59 - can do with this it might sound like a
04:00 - simple idea but even the notion of being
04:04 - able to add friends then it seems like
04:08 - such a simple feature but you have to
04:10 - think about what that entails right
04:13 - being able to add a friend means that
04:16 - you have to implement the ability to
04:19 - send a friend request and then have the
04:21 - other person accept or reject it it also
04:24 - breaks into
04:27 - what sorts of things do you want to
04:30 - allow other people to see are you is it
04:34 - going to be like a free-for-all like
04:35 - just think about Facebook's own privacy
04:37 - settings even even having a friend on
04:41 - Facebook you have close-knit circles and
04:44 - you have you have different different
04:46 - groups I think different privacy
04:48 - settings now I don't use Facebook that
04:50 - much but I I know that they have
04:53 - different privacy settings even within
04:55 - your friends so I think there's a notion
04:58 - of friends and close friends or
04:59 - something like that I might be wrong on
05:01 - that but so anyways that was that idea
05:04 - another one was a Wine Library type of
05:08 - app where you can basically add wines
05:12 - from your wine collection take a photo
05:14 - of the bottle and label and put your
05:17 - tasting notes and all of that stuff on
05:19 - it and it basically just keep track of
05:23 - your collection of wine or maybe wines
05:25 - that you want to try now I'm not a huge
05:29 - wine connoisseur myself but I can see
05:32 - that this app you know I enjoy the glass
05:34 - of wine from time to time and my own
05:36 - difficulty is that I might try a bottle
05:39 - and I really like it but I don't really
05:42 - keep track of it I don't remember I
05:43 - throw I always throw away the bottles I
05:45 - don't keep them and then the next time I
05:47 - want to buy wine I forget what that was
05:49 - and so you know this was something that
05:51 - was going to help me keep track of the
05:53 - ones that I do like that I have enjoyed
05:56 - but I can see this being an app that
05:59 - could be adopted for different purposes
06:03 - maybe collectors who collect different
06:05 - things just as a way for them to keep
06:08 - track of a collection of something you
06:10 - know fun tip at one point I actually
06:12 - collected Starbucks cards now these are
06:15 - the little gift cards that you can get
06:16 - at Starbucks and they have little
06:18 - different designs on them these days
06:20 - they produce so many different designs
06:22 - that I kind of gave up but back then in
06:25 - the early days there weren't as many
06:27 - designs so it definitely was collectible
06:29 - and the cool thing was that every
06:31 - country would have their own designs and
06:34 - their own Starbucks cards and so it was
06:36 - fun getting the cards from like all over
06:38 - the world
06:38 - so that was something that I collected
06:40 - at one point I also considered
06:43 - continuing my Pomodoro timer app now
06:47 - that is definitely something that I want
06:50 - to continue in it for those of you guys
06:51 - who have been watching this channel for
06:53 - a little longer you know that about
06:56 - maybe over six months ago maybe eight
06:58 - months ago I was doing live streams
07:00 - every week where we were going to build
07:02 - an app together and we were gonna submit
07:04 - it to the App Store and we got so far as
07:08 - determining the future set and doing
07:10 - some design work on it but and then an
07:13 - early prototype for working with timers
07:17 - in the background even when your app is
07:19 - off we did some work with that but it
07:22 - was never completed so another testament
07:24 - to my inability to finish projects what
07:27 - I make up for that though is that I
07:29 - won't give up so it's always in the back
07:31 - of my mind and I am definitely gonna
07:33 - come back and finish this project so
07:35 - finally the idea that I did arrive at
07:38 - for this fire store and authentication
07:42 - series is something that I've actually
07:45 - been wanting to do myself and it's
07:49 - something that I've been I wouldn't say
07:51 - struggling I'm not actually actively
07:53 - trying to do this but it's something
07:55 - that I can see the benefits of and that
07:57 - is a daily gratitude journal so you know
08:02 - we have so much to be thankful for no
08:04 - matter what our situation is there's
08:07 - always going to be things that we want
08:09 - the things that we want to achieve or
08:11 - maybe material things that we want in
08:13 - life goals that we haven't hit yet but I
08:16 - think that also oftentimes takes us away
08:21 - from looking at what we do have because
08:23 - there are people who are less fortunate
08:25 - than us who have less than us and they
08:28 - would just love to have just the ability
08:31 - to walk for example someone who might
08:33 - not be in very good health just walking
08:35 - to the bathroom by themselves or maybe
08:38 - being able to enjoy oranges for example
08:41 - someone who has stomach problems we
08:43 - can't take that sort of citric acid that
08:46 - acidity and so I think there are there's
08:50 - a lot for all
08:51 - us to be thankful for things that we
08:54 - kind of take for granted and we don't
08:55 - notice from day to day family right a
08:59 - lot of people have lost loved ones and
09:01 - things like that and sometimes you you
09:04 - just don't know what you have until it's
09:05 - gone right I think that's saying it's so
09:07 - true
09:07 - so this gratitude journal normally
09:11 - that's something that's kind of private
09:14 - I would say but the idea here is a
09:17 - social gratitude journal and the reason
09:20 - I say social is because I think this
09:25 - would be a good experiment because I
09:27 - think in sharing what you're grateful
09:30 - for it makes other people who read that
09:34 - reflect on their life and you know if
09:37 - that's something that they can be
09:39 - grateful for as well and in addition to
09:43 - being able to see what other people are
09:45 - grateful for and you can obviously write
09:48 - your own post you'll only be able to
09:52 - like each other's posts and I use the
09:56 - term like very loosely because I don't
09:59 - know if it's gonna be you know like
10:00 - thumbs up or high-five or something like
10:02 - that but some sort of props and in
10:05 - posting what you're grateful for and
10:07 - then receiving you know thanks or
10:10 - receiving handclaps or high-fives for
10:12 - that I think that will also reinforce
10:15 - your good vibes a and also reinforce
10:21 - your want to post again the next day and
10:24 - the idea of the app is to hopefully
10:27 - build up your habit to have a daily
10:30 - habit to think about what you're
10:33 - grateful for so this one I think is a
10:36 - simple app to implement I can see a use
10:39 - for it certainly for myself I think will
10:41 - be the fun experiment to see if to see
10:45 - if people like to do this in a social
10:48 - sort of way
10:49 - versus in a private sort of way so let
10:53 - me go through kind of like a v1 what
10:55 - features I had in mind so obviously we
10:58 - have creating an account and logging in
11:00 - then you'd be able to see a list of
11:03 - posts
11:04 - by other people and then you'd be able
11:06 - to obviously like a post whether that
11:10 - that is thanking or hand clapping
11:13 - remains to be seen
11:15 - you're going to be able to write a new
11:17 - post your own you know what you're
11:19 - grateful for and then we're gonna also
11:23 - have your profile and that's just going
11:25 - to be your username which you can edit
11:27 - maybe some stats like how many times
11:29 - you've posted what's your longest streak
11:31 - how many handclaps or likes or
11:34 - high-fives you've received ability to
11:36 - delete your account I think that's
11:38 - important now due to privacy and all
11:40 - that and also to be able to see a list
11:42 - of your own posts and to be able to
11:44 - delete them and finally just a welcomed
11:48 - sort of tutorial screen the minute you
11:50 - create your account just to give you an
11:52 - overview of what the different tabs do
11:54 - how you use the app and what it's for
11:56 - and that sort of thing so that's it like
11:59 - that's the app in its hole and and
12:00 - that's where I want to get it to to be
12:04 - able to publish that into the App Store
12:06 - I do have some v2 ideas such as private
12:11 - only posts so maybe you're posting
12:13 - something sensitive but you still want
12:15 - to write it if you set it to like
12:17 - private only then it's only gonna show
12:19 - up for you like you'll be able to see it
12:22 - in your post feed but then it won't be
12:24 - social and won't other people are not
12:27 - going to see that maybe commenting maybe
12:30 - profile photos push notifications so
12:34 - that when you post something it's gonna
12:35 - notify other people reminder
12:38 - notifications so something that would
12:40 - remind you each day to write what you're
12:43 - grateful for and then maybe just
12:45 - collapsible posts because I'm not
12:47 - planning to complicate it further by
12:49 - allowing you to drill into a post I'm
12:52 - just going to put the full text in the
12:55 - list now if you have more suggestions
12:58 - and ideas for features and v2 ideas
13:02 - please drop me a comment below and let
13:04 - me know I definitely have a lot to think
13:08 - about there's there's a lot more I know
13:10 - that I can do with this for the v1
13:12 - however I want to make it just that
13:14 - feature set because I think that's
13:17 - the minimum amount of features that's
13:19 - going to make it useful and I want to
13:20 - polish it I want to make it like really
13:23 - really fluid and really nice to use and
13:25 - so that you want to keep using it so
13:28 - that's the idea there I hope that that's
13:31 - something that you're interested in and
13:33 - if not I hope you will even stick around
13:35 - just to figure out how to do some of
13:39 - these features from a technical
13:40 - standpoint because you can definitely
13:41 - adapt what you learn to your own app
13:45 - idea and I think it's going to be really
13:47 - fun for us to get to the end here and
13:49 - then submit the app together I'll show
13:51 - you guys how to write all the metadata
13:53 - create the screenshots write the
13:54 - description submit it from Xcode and it
13:58 - will hopefully get it approved I haven't
14:00 - done any sort of competitor analysis I
14:05 - haven't seen what other gratitude
14:09 - journal apps out there do I haven't
14:11 - thought about how to monetize this app
14:13 - or anything like that
14:14 - the goal isn't really for me to make any
14:17 - money off of it I really just want to
14:20 - build up the habit of finishing my apps
14:23 - publishing them and at the same time
14:26 - being able to teach you guys different
14:28 - features and I think also one more thing
14:31 - is that by making this app shorter I am
14:34 - able to finish it and then move on and
14:36 - create a different app tutorial series
14:39 - for you guys showing a completely
14:41 - different set of features if we were to
14:44 - really just work on this and and do a
14:47 - big complex app it probably take up
14:50 - months and months and then this will be
14:53 - the only thing you guys see on the
14:55 - YouTube channel for like half the year
14:57 - so you know I think that's the other
15:00 - benefit of doing a short feature set
15:04 - anyways I hope you guys enjoyed that if
15:06 - so please give me a like subscribe if
15:10 - you want to see the future videos don't
15:11 - forget to hit that Bell icon so that you
15:13 - know when the next video comes up
15:15 - alright thanks for watching I'll see you
15:17 - guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

hey code crew what's up it's Chris here now this video is a little bit different from our usual videos where you see the backdrop in the back and that frames this is still the same room it's just that I'm not using the computer today because in this lesson I want to tell you about what we're going to be building in this series I realized that I haven't really talked about that all I told you in the

and that wasn't too small that it would be too trivial and wouldn't be useful at all I went through a whole bunch of different ideas but every time I did that I just start adding more and more things and I know it would take a lot of time to build and the problem with that it's not that I don't want to show you guys how to build a really complex out it's just that those things would take a pretty long time and there is a high chance that I won't finish it because it's something that I struggle with and that is finishing projects so what I want to train myself to do is to not bite off more than I can chew is to be really specific about the feature set that I want to implement as v1 Minimum Viable Product and submitted to the App Store and get it out there and really go through that process and build up my habit of finishing my projects and shipping it and I think that's not something that's uncommon to a lot of people I think I you know game developers especially I know they have a lot of halffinished games or game prototypes lying around and they're notorious for having to build up this habit of completing their games and shipping it and so I have the same problem here with apps I want to build something that is small enough that I can publish now I can I can tell you some of the ideas that I did have I have this notebook that I just write in some of the time and just whenever I have an idea now the first idea I had was a poll app and that is basically the way I described it here in the book was a crowdsource a decision on you're undecided matters so I know a lot of the

add a friend means that you have to implement the ability to send a friend request and then have the other person accept or reject it it also breaks into what sorts of things do you want to allow other people to see are you is it going to be like a freeforall like just think about Facebook's own privacy settings even even having a friend on Facebook you have closeknit circles and you have you have different different groups I think different privacy settings now I don't use Facebook that much but I I know that they have different privacy settings even within your friends so I think there's a notion of friends and close friends or something like that I might be wrong on that but so anyways that was that idea another one was a Wine Library type of app where you can basically add wines from your wine collection take a photo of the bottle and label and put your tasting notes and all of that stuff on it and it basically just keep track of your collection of wine or maybe wines that you want to try now I'm not a huge wine connoisseur myself but I can see that this app you know I enjoy the glass of wine from time to time and my own difficulty is that I might try a bottle and I really like it but I don't really keep track of it I don't remember I throw I always throw away the bottles I don't keep them and then the next time I want to buy wine I forget what that was and so you know this was something that was going to help me keep track of the ones that I do like that I have enjoyed but I can see this being an app that could be adopted for different purposes maybe collectors who collect different things just as a way for them to keep track of a collection of something you know fun tip at one point I actually collected Starbucks cards now these are the little gift cards that you can get at Starbucks and they have little different designs on them these days they produce so many different designs that I kind of gave up but back then in the early days there weren't as many designs so it definitely was collectible and the cool thing was that every country would have their own designs and their own Starbucks cards and so it was fun getting the cards from like all over the world so that was something that I collected at one point I also considered continuing my Pomodoro timer app now that is definitely something that I want to continue in it for those of you guys who have been watching this channel for a little longer you know that about maybe over six months ago maybe eight months ago I was doing live streams every week where we were going to

what features I had in mind so obviously we have creating an account and logging in then you'd be able to see a list of posts by other people and then you'd be able to obviously like a post whether that that is thanking or hand clapping remains to be seen you're going to be able to write a new post your own you know what you're grateful for and then we're gonna also have your profile and that's just going to be your username which you can edit maybe some stats like how many times you've posted what's your longest streak how many handclaps or likes or highfives you've received ability to delete your account I think that's important now due to privacy and all that and also to be able to see a list of your own posts and to be able to delete them and finally just a welcomed sort of tutorial screen the minute you create your account just to give you an overview of what the different tabs do how you use the app and what it's for and that sort of thing so that's it like that's the app in its hole and and that's where I want to get it to to be able to publish that into the App Store I do have some v2 ideas such as private only posts so maybe you're posting something sensitive but you still want to write it if you set it to like private only then it's only gonna show up for you like you'll be able to see it in your post feed but then it won't be social and won't other people are not going to see that maybe commenting maybe profile photos push notifications so that when you post something it's gonna notify other people reminder notifications so something that would remind you each day to write what you're grateful for and then maybe just collapsible posts because I'm not planning to complicate it further by allowing you to drill into a post I'm just going to put the full text in the list now if you have more suggestions and ideas for features and v2 ideas please drop me a comment below and let me know I definitely have a lot to think about there's there's a lot more I know that I can do with this for the v1 however I want to make it just that feature set because I think that's the minimum amount of features that's going to make it useful and I want to polish it I want to make it like really really fluid and really nice to use and so that you want to keep using it so that's the idea there I hope that that's something that you're interested in and if not I hope you will even stick around just to figure out how to do some of these features from a technical standpoint because you can definitely adapt what you learn to your own app idea and I think it's going to be really fun for us to get to the end here and then submit the app together I'll show you guys how to write all the metadata create the screenshots write the description submit it from Xcode and it will hopefully get it approved I haven't done any sort of competitor analysis I haven't seen what other gratitude journal apps out there do I haven't thought about how to monetize this app or anything like that the goal isn't really for me to make any money off of it I really just want to build up the habit of finishing my apps publishing them and at the same time being able to teach you guys different features and I think also one more thing is that by making this app shorter I am able to finish it and then move on and create a different app tutorial series for you guys showing a completely different set of features if we were to really just work on this and and do a big complex app it probably take up months and months and then this will be the only thing you guys see on the YouTube channel for like half the year so you know I think that's the other benefit of doing a short feature set anyways I hope you guys enjoyed that if so please give me a like subscribe if you want to see the future videos don't forget to hit that Bell icon so that you know when the next video comes up alright thanks for watching I'll see you guys next time
