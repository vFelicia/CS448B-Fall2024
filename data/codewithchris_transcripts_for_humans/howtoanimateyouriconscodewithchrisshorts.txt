00:09 - 17 you can animate your SF symbols with

00:14 - examples of what you can do discrete
00:15 - effects happen once whenever you trigger
00:17 - them these are all examples of discrete
00:20 - effects bounce pulse and variable color
00:22 - are all examples of discrete effects
00:24 - whenever this value changes it triggers
00:27 - the effect once indefinite effects
00:29 - continue until you turn them off these
00:31 - are all examples of indefinite effects
00:33 - pulse variable color and scale are all
00:36 - examples of indefinite effects turn them
00:38 - on or off with this Boolean parameter
00:40 - notice that pulse and variable color can
00:43 - be applied as either a discrete or
00:45 - indefinite effect finally you have
00:47 - transition and content transition
00:48 - effects where you can animate things in
