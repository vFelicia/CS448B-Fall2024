00:00 - hey code crew it's chris here i just
00:02 - want to quickly let you know that we
00:03 - have a new community
00:04 - app challenge last month we did the
00:06 - weather app and
00:08 - thank you so much to everyone who
00:09 - participated the apps you guys built
00:11 - were awesome
00:12 - in the last video i actually did a
00:14 - showcase of all of the app videos that
00:16 - you submitted go check that out if you
00:18 - haven't already
00:19 - this month i'm asking you to build a
00:21 - stock tracker app
00:22 - now this app should manage a list of
00:25 - stock ticker symbols
00:26 - and connect to an api to fetch the
00:29 - latest stock
00:30 - quotes in the challenge we've suggested
00:32 - a stock api to use but feel free to use
00:34 - any that you'd like the unfortunate
00:36 - thing about the one we chose is
00:39 - although we used it for our solution
00:40 - when we built our project
00:42 - it had free batch stock quotes which was
00:45 - really handy
00:47 - but since then it's only made single
00:49 - stock quotes
00:50 - free so if you know of an api that
00:53 - allows you to do batch stock quotes for
00:55 - free
00:56 - definitely let me know by leaving a
00:57 - comment below now in the process of
00:59 - doing this challenge
01:00 - you'll turn your knowledge into skill
01:03 - sometimes we get so caught up with
01:05 - just watching videos or just reading
01:07 - books and
01:08 - we think we understand it but it's not
01:10 - until we apply that knowledge and try to
01:12 - turn that into practical skill
01:14 - that we discover our weaknesses our
01:17 - knowledge gaps our skill gaps
01:19 - so that is one big reason why we are
01:21 - doing these community app challenges
01:23 - just to give people a reason to get
01:26 - hands-on and start coding and start
01:28 - applying what they're learning
01:30 - oh and we've also created a nifty new
01:33 - code crew forum badge that you'll get
01:35 - just for participating
01:37 - now in terms of deadlines you have until
01:39 - the end of this month
01:40 - june 1st to submit a video of your
01:43 - completed app
01:44 - there is a link in the description below
01:46 - this video for you to
01:48 - record a video straight from your
01:50 - browser or upload
01:51 - a pre-recorded video and then at the end
01:54 - of the challenge
01:55 - we're going to take all of your videos
01:56 - and compile it into a showcase reel
01:58 - and post it here on youtube just like we
02:00 - did for the weather app now if you're
02:02 - brand new to
02:03 - coding and app development this
02:04 - challenge may be a little bit beyond
02:06 - your skill level
02:07 - for now but i've got some great
02:09 - resources to get you caught up
02:11 - start by checking out our 14 day
02:12 - beginner challenge right over there
02:14 - and that's going to get you started on
02:16 - the right foot so if you're going to
02:18 - take part in this challenge
02:19 - please leave me a comment below and
02:21 - thank you for watching i'll see you guys
