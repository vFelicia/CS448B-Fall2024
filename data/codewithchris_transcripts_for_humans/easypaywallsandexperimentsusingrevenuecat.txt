00:00 - hello it's Chris here quick question which pay 
wall do you think generates more Revenue by the  
00:04 - way this is an app called Emoji me sticker 
maker the answer is paywall a it generates  
00:10 - 50% more conversions than paywall b now if you 
want to check out more of these tests go to the  
00:15 - app Master's YouTube channel but I'll let you in 
on a little secret just because someone got this  
00:20 - result doesn't mean that it'll work exactly the 
same way for your app I mean there are so many  
00:25 - different variables different industry different 
audience perhaps different platform and the list  
00:30 - goes on if you want results like these for your 
app you have to run your own experiments on your  
00:35 - own pay walls and that's why I was so excited when 
Revenue cat asked if I wanted to cover their new  
00:41 - pay walls and experiments features finally an easy 
way to deploy High converting pay walls and to run  
00:47 - split tests on them special thanks to revenue cat 
for sponsoring this tutorial Revenue cat helps you  
00:52 - generate more revenue from your app and they do 
this in several ways making it easy to add inap  
00:57 - purchases and subscriptions to your app giving 
giving you accurate analytics across platforms  
01:02 - and helping you optimize your Revenue through AB 
testing and in today's video we're checking out  
01:07 - their latest feature to help you make more money 
pay wall and pay wall experiments let's Dive Right  
01:12 - In hey check this out I was able to customize my 
pay wall in the dashboard and then with one line  
01:18 - of code display that pay wall in my app I'll show 
you how to do this but before that we need to take  
01:24 - a step back in order to sell something on your pay 
wall you have to have something to sell right so  
01:29 - here's the setup that I've done before creating my 
pay wall so first I set up the products I want to  
01:34 - sell inside App Store connect and in this case I 
have an annual a discounted annual and a monthly  
01:40 - subscription next I created my free revenuecat 
account over at revenue cat.com and then I linked  
01:47 - my Revenue cat account to my App Store connect 
account and this is just done by pasting a secret  
01:53 - key from App Store Connect into my Revenue Cat 
Project next I created Revenue cat products that  
01:59 - map to the products in app store connect and I 
reference it by the App Store connect product ID  
02:06 - and then I created a pro tier inside Revenue cat 
and they call this an entitlement but essentially  
02:12 - it's something that buying those products can 
grant access to so then I linked up the three  
02:19 - Revenue cat products to this entitlement that 
means that if you buy any one of them it will  
02:24 - unlock this Pro tier entitlement next I created 
three offers in Revenue cat so an offer is what  
02:31 - gets presented on a pay wall one offer is the 
standard everyday pricing the other offer is  
02:38 - for sales and the last offer is something that I 
wanted to test by offering multiple durations of  
02:45 - subscriptions and this is something we'll get to 
in the later part of the video next in each of my  
02:50 - offers I created product slots they actually call 
them packages but I think of them as slots on my  
02:56 - offer where you can attach the products that you 
want in that offer finally I assigned the products  
03:02 - into the appropriate slots in my three offers and 
now I'm ready to create a pay wall for each offer  
03:09 - by the way I've got a video showing how to do all 
of this configuration step by step just check out  
03:14 - the video right over here now let's take a look at 
how easy it is to create a pay wall in Revenue cat  
03:19 - so here I am in my Revenue cat dashboard looking 
at my project as you saw in the slides before we  
03:25 - have three offers and you can create a pay wall 
for each of them so I'm going to go ahead and  
03:30 - create a pay wall for my standard offer which 
is a single option of an annual subscription so  
03:36 - click on ADD pay wall and we can select one from 
the gallery as a starting point for customization  
03:43 - there are three currently but there will be more 
in the future so this one is good for if you have  
03:49 - several different options this one is good for 
if you have a single option this one is also a  
03:54 - single option this one seems more visual I like 
that one I'm going to stick with this one as a  
03:59 - start starting point and there are don't be fooled 
there are a lot of fields here but not all of them  
04:06 - are necessary are absolutely required so first of 
all I'm going to change the photo here I have one  
04:13 - prepared on my computer I think yeah this one 
right here and just in case you are wondering  
04:19 - I got these illustrations from icons8.com so that 
changes that and actually this placeholder content  
04:29 - is not too far off from what my image suggests 
so I'm going to go ahead and type the title as
04:35 - well all right so there's the title there's a 
little blurb that you can show you can customize  
04:54 - any of the colors and you can even show um you 
can select different colors for dark mode so up  
05:01 - here in this preview you can select dark mode like 
that and you can see what that would look like and  
05:06 - customize the colors for that as well so I'm going 
to change it back to light mode for now and let's  
05:12 - take a look at what package means so as I alluded 
to in the slides before a package is kind of like  
05:18 - a slot for a pay wall since this pay wall displays 
one purchase option I have the ability to select  
05:24 - one thing and in um this pay wall for my standard 
offer offing only has one package anyways that's  
05:31 - why there's no selection here if my offering had 
the monthly and the annual option then I would  
05:36 - be able to make multiple selections here so I'm 
going to go ahead and select this button for my  
05:42 - annual plan and then this package details is 
basically it's this text up here and you can  
05:49 - see in the watermark it says full access for just 
and then there's these two squiggly brackets that  
05:56 - is a dynamic variable so you can insert ERT 
information about your packages pricing and  
06:03 - different things like that actually in the revenue 
cat documents for creating a pay wall it lists all  
06:09 - these different variables that you can insert into 
that text so I'll link to this document in the  
06:14 - description below the video but we will probably 
use let's see here we'll probably use this one  
06:21 - which is what they suggest in the placeholder 
as well so let me go ahead and copy and paste  
06:27 - and get full access for only and then you have to 
have these opening squiggly brackets paste in my  
06:38 - variable close the squiggly brackets now you might 
think you typed it in wrong because in the preview  
06:43 - it shows this it shows the variable name right 
but if you go up here into display settings you  
06:49 - have to check this variable preview values and 
it will substitute that variable for the actual  
06:55 - data you're trying to insert so that you can see 
what you're doing see how it's going to look like  
07:01 - if you have an introductory offer like a sale or 
something like that you could type that here as  
07:05 - well but we don't have that for this particular 
package and then for the call to action you can  
07:12 - change the color for light mode and dark mode I'm 
going to leave it as green here and you can also  
07:18 - um fill this out like enroll now for example if 
you have a trial that's where you would put that  
07:25 - call to action there and then for footer links 
you can put your terms of service or privacy URLs  
07:32 - here and then you're done don't forget to hit 
save though or create pay wall in this case so  
07:37 - what you're doing here essentially is designing 
how your pay wall is going to look now typically  
07:42 - this is done in a piece of design software such as 
figma and then you're going to have to translate  
07:46 - that design into code and then to uh integrate 
that in your xcode project however with Revenue  
07:52 - cat you don't have to do any of that let's take 
a look at how easy it is to deploy your pay wall  
07:56 - inside your app so right here I'm looking at at my 
excode project I have not integrated any Revenue  
08:02 - cat stuff just yet I want to show you how easy it 
is to do this so first of all we have to install  
08:07 - the revenue cat libraries or SDK into our exco 
project if we take a look at the docs again and we  
08:13 - scroll all the way up to installing the SDK let's 
click on iOS I want to show you how easy this is  
08:18 - and that's why I'm going through this with you we 
can use Swift package manager to install it and  
08:24 - we just copy this URL go up to file go up to add 
package dependencies and then we just search for  
08:31 - it and that's the one let's click on ADD package 
and wait for this to go for what we're doing we  
08:38 - don't need this one and we don't need this one so 
Revenue cat this is the core functionality Revenue  
08:44 - cat UI this is some of that pay wall stuff that 
you're going to see all right so now that that's  
08:49 - added here in my app entry point I can import 
Revenue cat and then inside the initializer so  
08:58 - let's do that here we are going to connect our 
app to our Revenue cap project by adding our API  
09:07 - key here uh configure with API key let's go and 
grab that from here uh so we're going to have to  
09:17 - get out of there for a second I'm going to grab my 
API key here just going to paste that in here and  
09:26 - then we also want to set the log level to debug 
and this is going to be very helpful as we are  
09:35 - configuring and building our app and just testing 
the inapp purchases and speaking of debugging Rue  
09:41 - cat actually has this really helpful tool for 
developers this debug Revenue cat overlay if we  
09:48 - just attach this to our root View and I run this 
this is going to give us all sorts of information  
09:55 - such as whether or not it can actually um connect 
to our Revenue Cat Project and fetch the data so  
10:03 - that you're not wrestling with those issues so 
you can see right away that when I launch my  
10:08 - app I see all of this information SDK version 
status is okay that's connected and everything  
10:14 - like that so this is super duper handy so now we 
are actually ready to go we have installed the  
10:21 - SDK and now we're ready to present our paywall 
simply as easy as that so I'm going to get rid  
10:26 - of this debug overlay for a second and with one 
line of code I can show a pay wall present pay  
10:34 - wall if needed here and there are actually two of 
them here so this one I can control by passing in  
10:40 - a Boolean whether or not it should present 
the payall but this one is even more handy I  
10:45 - can just specify the entitlement and that I've 
specified as the pro tier you saw this earlier  
10:53 - when we were going through the diagram right 
whenever someone buys any product it entitles  
10:58 - them to unlock this Pro tier so here using this 
second option and you specify the identifier of  
11:06 - that entitlement it will basically do the checking 
to see if the user has the pro entitlement or not  
11:11 - and if it doesn't it will present the pay wall 
because if that user has already unlocked that  
11:17 - Pro entitlement it shouldn't show the pay wall 
that is going to do the detection for you so  
11:22 - that is the single line of code I'm going to run 
the app and it's going to display the pay wall for  
11:27 - me just like that I don't even have to code this 
up right all I did was customize it through the  
11:34 - dashboard right here now this isn't the only way 
to display your pay wall you can also integrate  
11:40 - it as part of your own custom pay wall design 
let's take a look at how we can do that so if  
11:44 - we don't want to show it as a full screen pay 
wall what we can do is instead integrate it as  
11:51 - part of our Custom Design so I'm going to get rid 
of this modifier for just a second here and inside  
11:56 - content view right now I just have a scroll View 
but I have um just put together a simple pay wall  
12:04 - a custom one here which I will show you let's put 
an instance of that right there and if we take a  
12:11 - look at the preview here is what it looks like so 
it's got a whole bunch of uh placeholder text but  
12:17 - that's okay for the purpose of this demonstration 
because I want to show you how you can add uh the  
12:23 - pay wall functionality to this custom View and 
oh at the top first you have to make sure you  
12:29 - import Revenue cat UI so that you can access this 
modifier and this is just pay wall footer that's  
12:38 - it this modifier right here and it just adds 
that down there so let's take a look at what  
12:44 - this looks like so here is our custom pay Wall 
Part and this part is supplied by Revenue cat  
12:52 - you don't have to even write any code to handle 
the purchasing or anything like that all done  
12:57 - for you and don't forget you always have the 
option of retrieving the offer data yourself  
13:02 - and displaying your own buttons but at that point 
you're pretty much building your own pay wall and  
13:07 - you're losing many of the cool features such as 
ease of deployment and this next feature that I'm  
13:12 - going to talk to you about which is customizing 
your pay walls dynamically this is one of my  
13:17 - favorite features let's go back to the full screen 
pay wall I am going to remove this stuff here  
13:23 - we're going to go back to the app entry point and 
we are going to display the full screen pay wall
13:29 - again okay and then now we can go into 
the dashboard and we can change some of  
13:40 - the information here and it will be reflected 
in the app without having to change any code  
13:46 - in there so that is really cool you could 
for example change the image so why don't  
13:52 - we change it to this one change it it to that 
one right there and then let's also change this
14:01 - text all right okay don't forget to save it and 
then if we go back to the app and rerun it we  
14:18 - should see the changes so if you imagine your 
app is in the App Store and you can change up  
14:25 - how your pay wall looks the copy the images 
without submitting any updates without going  
14:32 - through the review process again all of it done 
dynamically from the revenue cat dashboard super  
14:38 - awesome so let's say you're happy with your pay 
wall how can you be sure that you're maximizing  
14:43 - the lifetime value or LTV of your users would not 
offering a monthly option be better or perhaps  
14:50 - offering a trial would up your conversions and 
hopefully people stick afterwards and become  
14:56 - paying customers well to answer these questions 
we can run Revenue cat experiments let's see  
15:02 - how a revenue cat experiment lets you pit two 
offers against each other to see which offer  
15:08 - would generate a higher lifetime value for your 
customer and it does this by showing one offer to  
15:13 - half of your new users and the other offer to 
the other half of your users then Revenue cat  
15:18 - will track the revenue generated by these users 
over time so that you can determine which offer  
15:24 - is ultimately better now before you start an 
experiment you really need to decide what you  
15:29 - want to test first if you're not sure they have 
some ideas for you to try in this article Link in  
15:34 - the description below now once you know what 
you want to test you need to create a second  
15:38 - offer with the change that you want to test and 
Associated pay wall for that the original offer is  
15:44 - called the control and the one you're testing is 
called the treatment and they have a great article  
15:49 - here for things to keep in mind when creating the 
treatment offer again link to this article in the  
15:54 - description below so now you're ready to start 
an experiment so inside inside the revenue cat  
15:59 - dashboard first of all actually I want to explain 
to you what my offers are and what I want to test  
16:05 - so my standard offering is one annual plan so 
you saw my pay wall it's just a single button  
16:11 - that says enroll now but I'm wondering if we 
offer a monthly plan as well on that pay wall  
16:19 - would that ultimately generate more lifetime value 
per customer on average or would sticking with my  
16:26 - standard offering be better so that is what I 
want to test this offer versus this offer now  
16:32 - I should go into pay walls and I should create 
a pay wall for that uh treatment offer right so  
16:39 - you go ahead and click on ADD pay wall and this 
one would be a good one because this one shows  
16:44 - multiple plans and tiers right so I'm not going to 
go through that again but you can create the pay  
16:51 - wall there and once you have a pay wall for your 
control offer and your treatment offer you can go  
16:56 - into this experiments Tab and create your first 
first experiment now just a note if you're not on  
17:01 - the pro tier plan of Revenue cat you need to be in 
order to run experiments however the pro tier plan  
17:08 - is free up until you are making at least $2,500 
with your app per month if you are not making  
17:17 - that much money with your app don't worry about it 
pro tier is still free you just get to use all of  
17:21 - these features and play with them and test them 
out for free if you are making more than $2,500  
17:28 - per month mon with your app then I believe Revenue 
cat takes about 1% as a fee for the pro tier so  
17:35 - let's go ahead and create the new experiment and 
there are honestly not a lot of fields to fill out  
17:40 - here so let's give your experiment a name so I'm 
going to say annual versus annual and monthly and  
17:49 - the control is my standard offer and the treatment 
which is the thing I want to test it against uh is  
17:58 - the annual and monthly offer and then down here I 
just have to select my segmenting criteria that is  
18:07 - what portion or segment of my users do I want to 
enroll into this experiment first of all you have  
18:13 - to select which apps you want to be part of this 
experiment since I only have one app that's fine  
18:19 - which countries so this is users users from which 
country do you want to involve all countries uh  
18:26 - what amount of those users so 100% would be 
every single new user would either see like  
18:33 - they would be part of this experiment and half of 
them would see the control the other half would  
18:38 - see the treatment if you say let's say I know 50% 
that means that this 50% of users is not going to  
18:48 - be part of this experiment they're only going to 
see the standard offer but the other half that is  
18:54 - enrolled in this experiment half of that is going 
to see uh the control pay wall and the other half  
19:03 - is going to see the treatment pay wall so that's 
25% and 25% essentially a quarter of your users  
19:09 - going to see this another quarter is going to 
see that and then this 50% right here they're not  
19:15 - involved this in this experiment so they'll just 
see whatever you have set just the standard and  
19:21 - then you can go ahead and click create experiment 
now I have I don't have any running experiments  
19:26 - and because they take time time to see results 
I am just going to show you what results would  
19:33 - look like in this uh documentation so you're going 
to see a chart that looks like this which tracks  
19:39 - re like actual Revenue that has been realized by 
users over time so users um from pay wall a will  
19:49 - be one color users from payall B will be another 
color and you're going to see this Revenue which  
19:56 - one's going to be higher easy to see but there are 
also in addition to this graph some useful metrics  
20:03 - and charts to look at so you're going to see 
something like this this tracks conversion rate  
20:09 - like how many people actually sign up through the 
pay walls from your control versus your treatment  
20:16 - has the change been positive or negative and 
then paying customers so there is a difference  
20:22 - between conversion and paying customers simply 
because conversion could mean trial conversion  
20:26 - but that doesn't actually mean a pay Pay customer 
right so paying customers has uh the control work  
20:33 - better to generate paying customers or has the 
treatment pay wall worked better and then this  
20:38 - one is probably the most important one is actual 
realized Revenue which pay wall has generated  
20:43 - more revenue for you don't underestimate this 
feature guys this is super duper important and  
20:50 - can make a significant impact to your app this 
summer I attended the mobile growth Summit here  
20:55 - in Toronto and I listened as expert took to the 
stage and shared their wisdom about growing app  
21:01 - businesses I watched as the head of marketing of 
multiple big apps and companies such as wealth  
21:07 - simple Tim Hortons and more talk about how they 
run experiments and run tests to figure out what  
21:13 - converts the most users and what generates them 
the most Revenue they test things like which  
21:18 - signup incentives work better which pay walls work 
better when to show the pay walls should we offer  
21:25 - trials or not all of those questions they test 
and test than test my takeaway was that if you  
21:30 - are not running these tests yourself to collect 
this data and figure out these questions you're  
21:35 - probably leaving a lot of money on the table 
and that's why I'm so excited about these new  
21:39 - Revenue cat features because it gives us Indie 
developers the power to play alongside the big  
21:45 - cats so here's how you can get started using 
Revenue cat pay walls and experiments just go  
21:50 - to revenue cat.com click on get started 
and sign up for a free account pay walls  
21:55 - are on the free tier experiments are on the pro 
tier which is also free until you hit $2,500 in  
22:02 - Revenue a month now if you like this tutorial 
and you want me to dive deeper into Revenue  
22:07 - cat and explore more of the features that can 
help you make more money please drop a comment  
22:11 - below with the text more Revenue cat thanks so 
much for watching I'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hello it's Chris here quick question which pay wall do you think generates more Revenue by the way this is an app called Emoji me sticker maker the answer is paywall a it generates 50% more conversions than paywall b now if you want to check out more of these tests go to the app Master's YouTube channel but I'll let you in on a little secret just because someone got this result doesn't mean that it'll work exactly the same way for your app I mean there are so many different variables different industry different audience perhaps different platform and the list goes on if you want results like these for your app you have to run your own experiments on your own pay walls and that's why I was so excited when Revenue cat asked if I wanted to cover their new pay walls and experiments features finally an easy way to deploy High converting pay walls and to run split tests on them special thanks to revenue cat for sponsoring this tutorial Revenue cat helps you generate more revenue from your app and they do this in several ways making it easy to add inap purchases and subscriptions to your app giving giving you accurate analytics across platforms and helping you optimize your Revenue through AB testing and in today's video we're checking out their latest feature to help you make more money pay wall and pay wall experiments let's Dive Right In hey check this out I was able to customize my pay wall in the dashboard and then with one line of code display that pay wall in my app I'll show you how to do this but before that we need to take a step back in order to sell something on your pay wall you have to have something to sell right so here's the setup that I've done before creating my pay wall so first I set up the products I want to sell inside App Store connect and in this case I have an annual a discounted annual and a monthly subscription next I created my free revenuecat account over at revenue cat.com and then I linked my Revenue cat account to my App Store connect account and this is just done by pasting a secret key from App Store Connect into my Revenue Cat Project next I created Revenue cat products that map to the products in app store connect and I reference it by the App Store connect product ID and then I created a pro tier inside Revenue cat and they call this an entitlement but essentially it's something that buying those products can grant access to so then I linked up the three Revenue cat products to this entitlement that means that if you buy any one of them it will unlock this Pro tier entitlement next I created three offers in Revenue cat so an offer is what gets presented on a pay wall one offer is the standard everyday pricing the other offer is for sales and the last offer is something that I wanted to test by offering multiple durations of subscriptions and this is something we'll get to in the later part of the video next in each of my offers I created product slots they actually call them packages but I think of them as slots on my offer where you can attach the products that you want in that offer finally I assigned the products into the appropriate slots in my three offers and now I'm ready to create a pay wall for each offer by the way I've got a video showing how to do all of this configuration step by step just check out the video right over here now let's take a look at how easy it is to create a pay wall in Revenue cat so here I am in my Revenue cat dashboard looking at my project as you saw in the slides before we have three offers and you can create a pay wall for each of them so I'm going to go ahead and create a pay wall for my standard offer which is a single option of an annual subscription so click on ADD pay wall and we can select one from the gallery as a starting point for customization there are three currently but there will be more in the future so this one is good for if you have several different options this one is good for if you have a single option this one is also a single option this one seems more visual I like that one I'm going to stick with this one as a start starting point and there are don't be fooled there are a lot of fields here but not all of them are necessary are absolutely required so first of all I'm going to change the photo here I have one prepared on my computer I think yeah this one right here and just in case you are wondering I got these illustrations from icons8.com so that changes that and actually this placeholder content is not too far off from what my image suggests so I'm going to go ahead and type the title as well all right so there's the title there's a little blurb that you can show you can customize any of the colors and you can even show um you can select different colors for dark mode so up here in this preview you can select dark mode like that and you can see what that would look like and customize the colors for that as well so I'm going to change it back to light mode for now and let's take a look at what package means so as I alluded to in the slides before a package is kind of like a slot for a pay wall since this pay wall displays one purchase option I have the ability to select one thing and in um this pay wall for my standard offer offing only has one package anyways that's why there's no selection here if my offering had the monthly and the annual option then I would be able to make multiple selections here so I'm going to go ahead and select this button for my annual plan and then this package details is basically it's this text up here and you can see in the watermark it says full access for just and then there's these two squiggly brackets that is a dynamic variable so you can insert ERT information about your packages pricing and different things like that actually in the revenue cat documents for creating a pay wall it lists all these different variables that you can insert into that text so I'll link to this document in the description below the video but we will probably use let's see here we'll probably use this one which is what they suggest in the placeholder as well so let me go ahead and copy and paste and get full access for only and then you have to have these opening squiggly brackets paste in my variable close the squiggly brackets now you might think you typed it in wrong because in the preview it shows this it shows the variable name right but if you go up here into display settings you have to check this variable preview values and it will substitute that variable for the actual data you're trying to insert so that you can see what you're doing see how it's going to look like if you have an introductory offer like a sale or something like that you could type that here as well but we don't have that for this particular package and then for the call to action you can change the color for light mode and dark mode I'm going to leave it as green here and you can also um fill this out like enroll now for example if you have a trial that's where you would put that call to action there and then for footer links you can put your terms of service or privacy URLs here and then you're done don't forget to hit save though or create pay wall in this case so what you're doing here essentially is designing how your pay wall is going to look now typically this is done in a piece of design software such as figma and then you're going to have to translate that design into code and then to uh integrate that in your xcode project however with Revenue cat you don't have to do any of that let's take a look at how easy it is to deploy your pay wall inside your app so right here I'm looking at at my excode project I have not integrated any Revenue cat stuff just yet I want to show you how easy it is to do this so first of all we have to install the revenue cat libraries or SDK into our exco project if we take a look at the docs again and we scroll all the way up to installing the SDK let's click on iOS I want to show you how easy this is and that's why I'm going through this with you we can use Swift package manager to install it and we just copy this URL go up to file go up to add package dependencies and then we just search for it and that's the one let's click on ADD package and wait for this to go for what we're doing we don't need this one and we don't need this one so Revenue cat this is the core functionality Revenue cat UI this is some of that pay wall stuff that you're going to see all right so now that that's added here in my app entry point I can import Revenue cat and then inside the initializer so let's do that here we are going to connect our app to our Revenue cap project by adding our API key here uh configure with API key let's go and grab that from here uh so we're going to have to get out of there for a second I'm going to grab my API key here just going to paste that in here and then we also want to set the log level to debug and this is going to be very helpful as we are configuring and building our app and just testing the inapp purchases and speaking of debugging Rue cat actually has this really helpful tool for developers this debug Revenue cat overlay if we just attach this to our root View and I run this this is going to give us all sorts of information such as whether or not it can actually um connect to our Revenue Cat Project and fetch the data so that you're not wrestling with those issues so you can see right away that when I launch my app I see all of this information SDK version status is okay that's connected and everything like that so this is super duper handy so now we are actually ready to go we have installed the SDK and now we're ready to present our paywall simply as easy as that so I'm going to get rid of this debug overlay for a second and with one line of code I can show a pay wall present pay wall if needed here and there are actually two of them here so this one I can control by passing in a Boolean whether or not it should present the payall but this one is even more handy I can just specify the entitlement and that I've specified as the pro tier you saw this earlier when we were going through the diagram right whenever someone buys any product it entitles them to unlock this Pro tier so here using this second option and you specify the identifier of that entitlement it will basically do the checking to see if the user has the pro entitlement or not and if it doesn't it will present the pay wall because if that user has already unlocked that Pro entitlement it shouldn't show the pay wall that is going to do the detection for you so that is the single line of code I'm going to run the app and it's going to display the pay wall for me just like that I don't even have to code this up right all I did was customize it through the dashboard right here now this isn't the only way to display your pay wall you can also integrate it as part of your own custom pay wall design let's take a look at how we can do that so if we don't want to show it as a full screen pay wall what we can do is instead integrate it as part of our Custom Design so I'm going to get rid of this modifier for just a second here and inside content view right now I just have a scroll View but I have um just put together a simple pay wall a custom one here which I will show you let's put an instance of that right there and if we take a look at the preview here is what it looks like so it's got a whole bunch of uh placeholder text but that's okay for the purpose of this demonstration because I want to show you how you can add uh the pay wall functionality to this custom View and oh at the top first you have to make sure you import Revenue cat UI so that you can access this modifier and this is just pay wall footer that's it this modifier right here and it just adds that down there so let's take a look at what this looks like so here is our custom pay Wall Part and this part is supplied by Revenue cat you don't have to even write any code to handle the purchasing or anything like that all done for you and don't forget you always have the option of retrieving the offer data yourself and displaying your own buttons but at that point you're pretty much building your own pay wall and you're losing many of the cool features such as ease of deployment and this next feature that I'm going to talk to you about which is customizing your pay walls dynamically this is one of my favorite features let's go back to the full screen pay wall I am going to remove this stuff here we're going to go back to the app entry point and we are going to display the full screen pay wall again okay and then now we can go into the dashboard and we can change some of the information here and it will be reflected in the app without having to change any code in there so that is really cool you could for example change the image so why don't we change it to this one change it it to that one right there and then let's also change this text all right okay don't forget to save it and then if we go back to the app and rerun it we should see the changes so if you imagine your app is in the App Store and you can change up how your pay wall looks the copy the images without submitting any updates without going through the review process again all of it done dynamically from the revenue cat dashboard super awesome so let's say you're happy with your pay wall how can you be sure that you're maximizing the lifetime value or LTV of your users would not offering a monthly option be better or perhaps offering a trial would up your conversions and hopefully people stick afterwards and become paying customers well to answer these questions we can run Revenue cat experiments let's see how a revenue cat experiment lets you pit two offers against each other to see which offer would generate a higher lifetime value for your customer and it does this by showing one offer to half of your new users and the other offer to the other half of your users then Revenue cat will track the revenue generated by these users over time so that you can determine which offer is ultimately better now before you start an experiment you really need to decide what you want to test first if you're not sure they have some ideas for you to try in this article Link in the description below now once you know what you want to test you need to create a second offer with the change that you want to test and Associated pay wall for that the original offer is called the control and the one you're testing is called the treatment and they have a great article here for things to keep in mind when creating the treatment offer again link to this article in the description below so now you're ready to start an experiment so inside inside the revenue cat dashboard first of all actually I want to explain to you what my offers are and what I want to test so my standard offering is one annual plan so you saw my pay wall it's just a single button that says enroll now but I'm wondering if we offer a monthly plan as well on that pay wall would that ultimately generate more lifetime value per customer on average or would sticking with my standard offering be better so that is what I want to test this offer versus this offer now I should go into pay walls and I should create a pay wall for that uh treatment offer right so you go ahead and click on ADD pay wall and this one would be a good one because this one shows multiple plans and tiers right so I'm not going to go through that again but you can create the pay wall there and once you have a pay wall for your control offer and your treatment offer you can go into this experiments Tab and create your first first experiment now just a note if you're not on the pro tier plan of Revenue cat you need to be in order to run experiments however the pro tier plan is free up until you are making at least $2,500 with your app per month if you are not making that much money with your app don't worry about it pro tier is still free you just get to use all of these features and play with them and test them out for free if you are making more than $2,500 per month mon with your app then I believe Revenue cat takes about 1% as a fee for the pro tier so let's go ahead and create the new experiment and there are honestly not a lot of fields to fill out here so let's give your experiment a name so I'm going to say annual versus annual and monthly and the control is my standard offer and the treatment which is the thing I want to test it against uh is the annual and monthly offer and then down here I just have to select my segmenting criteria that is what portion or segment of my users do I want to enroll into this experiment first of all you have to select which apps you want to be part of this experiment since I only have one app that's fine which countries so this is users users from which country do you want to involve all countries uh what amount of those users so 100% would be every single new user would either see like they would be part of this experiment and half of them would see the control the other half would see the treatment if you say let's say I know 50% that means that this 50% of users is not going to be part of this experiment they're only going to see the standard offer but the other half that is enrolled in this experiment half of that is going to see uh the control pay wall and the other half is going to see the treatment pay wall so that's 25% and 25% essentially a quarter of your users going to see this another quarter is going to see that and then this 50% right here they're not involved this in this experiment so they'll just see whatever you have set just the standard and then you can go ahead and click create experiment now I have I don't have any running experiments and because they take time time to see results I am just going to show you what results would look like in this uh documentation so you're going to see a chart that looks like this which tracks re like actual Revenue that has been realized by users over time so users um from pay wall a will be one color users from payall B will be another color and you're going to see this Revenue which one's going to be higher easy to see but there are also in addition to this graph some useful metrics and charts to look at so you're going to see something like this this tracks conversion rate like how many people actually sign up through the pay walls from your control versus your treatment has the change been positive or negative and then paying customers so there is a difference between conversion and paying customers simply because conversion could mean trial conversion but that doesn't actually mean a pay Pay customer right so paying customers has uh the control work better to generate paying customers or has the treatment pay wall worked better and then this one is probably the most important one is actual realized Revenue which pay wall has generated more revenue for you don't underestimate this feature guys this is super duper important and can make a significant impact to your app this summer I attended the mobile growth Summit here in Toronto and I listened as expert took to the stage and shared their wisdom about growing app businesses I watched as the head of marketing of multiple big apps and companies such as wealth simple Tim Hortons and more talk about how they run experiments and run tests to figure out what converts the most users and what generates them the most Revenue they test things like which signup incentives work better which pay walls work better when to show the pay walls should we offer trials or not all of those questions they test and test than test my takeaway was that if you are not running these tests yourself to collect this data and figure out these questions you're probably leaving a lot of money on the table and that's why I'm so excited about these new Revenue cat features because it gives us Indie developers the power to play alongside the big cats so here's how you can get started using Revenue cat pay walls and experiments just go to revenue cat.com click on get started and sign up for a free account pay walls are on the free tier experiments are on the pro tier which is also free until you hit $2,500 in Revenue a month now if you like this tutorial and you want me to dive deeper into Revenue cat and explore more of the features that can help you make more money please drop a
