00:04 - hey coders what's up Chris here with
00:07 - episode 8 of how to make a YouTube video
00:09 - app in the previous lesson we had added
00:12 - our second view controller so let me
00:15 - demonstrate here in the app when we
00:16 - select a video from this list we go to a
00:20 - second view controller which we added to
00:22 - the storyboard and then it also shows
00:24 - this back button here and we we clicked
00:27 - that it comes back to this main UI
00:30 - tableview so in this episode what we're
00:32 - going to do is create the view
00:34 - controller class that is going to
00:36 - control this secondary detail view and
00:40 - we're also going to be adding the UI
00:41 - elements to this detail view so let's
00:44 - jump straight into our storyboard in our
00:46 - Xcode project you can see here that I've
00:49 - got a zoomed out view now I want to
00:51 - demonstrate something so remember when
00:54 - we were working with this view
00:56 - controller right here with our UI
00:58 - tableview and when we wanted to add the
01:01 - table view to our view controller dot
01:04 - swift by creating this IB outlet right
01:07 - here we were able to do that by clicking
01:10 - the assistant editor button here and it
01:14 - would show us the view controller on the
01:16 - right hand side and on the left hand
01:18 - side we would have our our view
01:21 - controller so we were able to hook it up
01:22 - as IB outlets now let's click the second
01:26 - view controller which we added you can
01:28 - see here on the right hand side that it
01:31 - shows the you actual UI view controller
01:33 - class that we can edit and that's
01:37 - because by dragging a view controller to
01:40 - the storyboard this is the actual UI
01:42 - view controller class from the UI kit
01:44 - framework as you can see here if I go to
01:47 - view controller swift this is the view
01:50 - controller class which is a subclass of
01:53 - the UI view controller so we need to
01:56 - create our own subclass of the UI view
01:59 - controller and it maybe we'll call it
02:01 - detail view controller or video detail
02:04 - view controller and then we got it in
02:06 - the storyboard we got to specify that
02:08 - this view controller right here is an
02:13 - instance of that detailed video or sorry
02:15 - video detailviewcontroller so let me
02:18 - show you how to do that we're going to
02:20 - go here on the file navigator we're
02:22 - going to right-click or ctrl + click and
02:25 - then go to new file choose the cocoa
02:30 - touch class and we're going to call this
02:34 - the video detail view controller make
02:37 - sure it's a subclass of uiviewcontroller
02:39 - spelled exactly like that with a capital
02:42 - u IV and then a capital c controller and
02:46 - you can uncheck also create zip file
02:49 - language to make sure that swift click
02:52 - Next and then let's save it in the
02:56 - project folder okay so now we have a new
02:59 - class called video detail view
03:02 - controller dot Swift we're going to jump
03:04 - into our storyboard and this time I'm
03:07 - going to let's go back to the single V
03:09 - right here I'm gonna click this second
03:12 - view controller and over here in the
03:15 - inspector pane I'm going to choose this
03:17 - tab right here it's the identity
03:20 - inspector and under the custom class I'm
03:23 - gonna be able to select the class which
03:26 - we just created it was called video
03:30 - detail view controller so now I'm
03:33 - basically telling Xcode that this
03:35 - instance on the storyboard is an
03:39 - instance of the video detailed view
03:41 - controller so now let's click this guy
03:43 - let's click assistant editor and we can
03:46 - see on the right hand side instead of
03:48 - showing the UI view controller class
03:50 - like it did before it's showing me the
03:53 - video detail view controller and in this
03:55 - way we're ready to add elements onto the
03:59 - storyboard of this guy and then connect
04:01 - them as IB outlets over here okay so now
04:06 - let's add our elements onto this
04:09 - storyboard so first of all I'm going to
04:11 - search for web view and you can see here
04:14 - displays embedded web content it's going
04:17 - to allow us to embed our YouTube video
04:20 - so I'm just gonna drag it and put it
04:21 - right here next we're going to
04:25 - search for label so we're gonna add two
04:28 - labels one for the title and one for the
04:29 - description so I'm gonna drag one and
04:31 - put it underneath the webview and drag
04:33 - another one put it underneath the
04:35 - webview there and now we're gonna add
04:37 - some constraints for all three maybe I
04:39 - should have added it for the webview
04:41 - before adding the labels but let's see
04:43 - how this works out okay so we're gonna
04:44 - click the webview and then I'm going to
04:46 - click this menu down here to open up the
04:50 - new constraints menu I'm gonna uncheck
04:52 - constraint margins I'm gonna enable the
04:55 - left top and right constraints for the
04:58 - top I'm gonna put zero but I'm going to
05:01 - make sure it says the top layout guide
05:04 - and the reason why I'm choosing the top
05:06 - layout guide is because it's embedded
05:08 - into a navigation controller so I don't
05:11 - want it right up as you can see here in
05:13 - the simulator it's got this bar right
05:15 - here and the layout guide is going to be
05:17 - right underneath that bar so I want it
05:20 - to be zero against the top layout guide
05:22 - if I say zero against the view the web
05:24 - view is actually going to reach all the
05:26 - way up here behind this bar and this bar
05:28 - is gonna be blocking half of the web
05:30 - view so I'm going to say lost the
05:34 - constraints there okay
05:36 - uncheck constrain the margins left top
05:38 - right I'm going to park it against the
05:43 - top layout guide and I'm gonna put zero
05:46 - for the left zero for the right zero and
05:50 - for the height I'm just going to put 184
05:52 - now it's going to be the same situation
05:54 - as the stable cells in our UI tableview
05:57 - where we're going to have to adjust this
06:00 - height constraint based on the width of
06:02 - the view and we're gonna have to
06:04 - calculate it and do that
06:05 - programmatically so I'm gonna add these
06:07 - four constraints now all right and then
06:09 - now we're going to add some constraints
06:13 - for the label before we update
06:14 - constraints so for the label let's set
06:17 - the properties first actually so here
06:20 - I'm gonna say number of lines is zero so
06:23 - that it's multiple lines for the text
06:26 - I'm gonna choose custom font and choose
06:29 - bold for the title maybe make it even a
06:32 - little larger let's say size 20 okay
06:37 - I want to park it underneath the webview
06:40 - so let's add some constraints to that
06:42 - guy
06:43 - uncheck constrain - margins left let's
06:45 - say it's 20 right let's say it's 20 and
06:50 - you can see these numbers changing on me
06:52 - make sure it doesn't change on you and
06:56 - 20 there we go for the top I'm gonna
07:00 - park it against the webview so let's say
07:04 - it's 20 from the webview as well and we
07:08 - also have to give this guy a height so
07:09 - let's say 100 make sure it's got enough
07:13 - for a couple of lines maybe it's a three
07:15 - line video title for the description
07:19 - let's add some constraints for that
07:21 - uncheck constrain - margins let's do
07:23 - left top and right so for the top I want
07:26 - to make sure it's parked against the
07:28 - title label let's say 20 and left this
07:34 - 20 and right is 20 as well so we're not
07:36 - gonna put a height for this guy so let's
07:40 - make sure that this description can be
07:42 - multiple lines as well by changing the
07:43 - number of lines to the zero
07:45 - okay now finally let's click this guy
07:48 - and update all frames let's choose an
07:51 - element first scroll down update frames
07:55 - for all views in the video detail
07:57 - controller okay so we've got them
08:00 - relatively in the places that we want
08:02 - that's the title label that's the
08:04 - description label which is going to fill
08:06 - up the bottom of the screen and we've
08:09 - got the web view here so let's go into
08:11 - the assistant editor and hook up these
08:14 - elements to our video detail view
08:17 - controller so I'm gonna hold down
08:18 - control click our web view and drag a
08:22 - line to create an iboutlet let me call
08:26 - this guy web view
08:30 - okay now let's do the same thing for the
08:32 - title label I call this the title label
08:37 - let's do it for the description let's
08:40 - call it the description label
08:44 - okay I'm gonna save it now let's go back
08:47 - to the standard editor or single view
08:49 - and let's run it to see what we have we
08:53 - shouldn't see anything in the web view
08:55 - because it's blank
08:56 - but let's click this cell so now we have
08:59 - our web view it seems a little bit off
09:01 - actually like there's this huge gap here
09:04 - so let's revisit the constraints but we
09:07 - do have our loops but we do have our
09:10 - title label and description here which
09:12 - is good so we're gonna go back to our
09:17 - storyboard now just to take a look at
09:19 - that top constraint for the web view
09:21 - it's open up the document outline open
09:25 - up this constraints so it says here web
09:28 - view top equals the top layout guide
09:31 - bottom and constant is 0 so let's try
09:35 - something where instead let's delete
09:39 - that constraint I'm gonna highlight this
09:41 - constraint and hit delete and we're
09:43 - gonna try to add it again
09:44 - so click the web View open up this menu
09:48 - uncheck constraint margins let's so we
09:53 - can either choose top layout guide
09:54 - current distance it's 0 from top layout
09:57 - guide or we can choose it from the view
10:00 - but the current distance is 64 which I
10:04 - assume is that distance that covers the
10:06 - top bar so let's give that a try let's
10:09 - make it relative to the top of the view
10:11 - but with a 64 margin
10:13 - okay now let's give it a run and maybe
10:17 - that will work better for us okay so I
10:21 - think it did so the web view is right up
10:24 - against this edge here which is what we
10:27 - want when we actually put the video in
10:28 - there I don't think we'll be able to
10:29 - scroll so in the next lesson we're
10:32 - actually going to fill in the video
10:33 - we're gonna fill in the title in the
10:34 - description and we're gonna hook it up
10:36 - so that when we tap on a cell it
10:38 - actually passes the video we chose to
10:40 - the detail view so it knows what to
10:42 - display so I want to thank you
10:44 - watching and sticking around if you
10:46 - liked this video and you like the series
10:47 - please share it with your co-workers and
10:49 - friends please give me a like and a
10:51 - subscribe and we're nearly finished the
10:54 - app so I'll see you guys tomorrow at 12
10:57 - talk to you later bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hey coders what's up Chris here with episode 8 of how to make a YouTube video app in the previous lesson we had added our second view controller so let me demonstrate here in the app when we select a video from this list we go to a second view controller which we added to the storyboard and then it also shows this back button here and we we clicked that it comes back to this main UI tableview so in this episode what we're going to do is create the view controller class that is going to control this secondary detail view and we're also going to be adding the UI elements to this detail view so let's jump straight into our storyboard in our Xcode project you can see here that I've got a zoomed out view now I want to demonstrate something so remember when we were working with this view controller right here with our UI tableview and when we wanted to add the table view to our view controller dot swift by creating this IB outlet right here we were able to do that by clicking the assistant editor button here and it would show us the view controller on the right hand side and on the left hand side we would have our our view controller so we were able to hook it up as IB outlets now let's click the second view controller which we added you can see here on the right hand side that it shows the you actual UI view controller class that we can edit and that's because by dragging a view controller to the storyboard this is the actual UI view controller class from the UI kit framework as you can see here if I go to view controller swift this is the view controller class which is a subclass of the UI view controller so we need to create our own subclass of the UI view controller and it maybe we'll call it detail view controller or video detail view controller and then we got it in the storyboard we got to specify that this view controller right here is an instance of that detailed video or sorry video detailviewcontroller so let me show you how to do that we're going to go here on the file navigator we're going to rightclick or ctrl + click and then go to new file choose the cocoa touch class and we're going to call this the video detail view controller make sure it's a subclass of uiviewcontroller spelled exactly like that with a capital u IV and then a capital c controller and you can uncheck also create zip file language to make sure that swift click Next and then let's save it in the project folder okay so now we have a new class called video detail view controller dot Swift we're going to jump into our storyboard and this time I'm going to let's go back to the single V right here I'm gonna click this second view controller and over here in the inspector pane I'm going to choose this tab right here it's the identity inspector and under the custom class I'm gonna be able to select the class which we just created it was called video detail view controller so now I'm basically telling Xcode that this instance on the storyboard is an instance of the video detailed view controller so now let's click this guy let's click assistant editor and we can see on the right hand side instead of showing the UI view controller class like it did before it's showing me the video detail view controller and in this way we're ready to add elements onto the storyboard of this guy and then connect them as IB outlets over here okay so now let's add our elements onto this storyboard so first of all I'm going to search for web view and you can see here displays embedded web content it's going to allow us to embed our YouTube video so I'm just gonna drag it and put it right here next we're going to search for label so we're gonna add two labels one for the title and one for the description so I'm gonna drag one and put it underneath the webview and drag another one put it underneath the webview there and now we're gonna add some constraints for all three maybe I should have added it for the webview before adding the labels but let's see how this works out okay so we're gonna click the webview and then I'm going to click this menu down here to open up the new constraints menu I'm gonna uncheck constraint margins I'm gonna enable the left top and right constraints for the top I'm gonna put zero but I'm going to make sure it says the top layout guide and the reason why I'm choosing the top layout guide is because it's embedded into a navigation controller so I don't want it right up as you can see here in the simulator it's got this bar right here and the layout guide is going to be right underneath that bar so I want it to be zero against the top layout guide if I say zero against the view the web view is actually going to reach all the way up here behind this bar and this bar is gonna be blocking half of the web view so I'm going to say lost the constraints there okay uncheck constrain the margins left top right I'm going to park it against the top layout guide and I'm gonna put zero for the left zero for the right zero and for the height I'm just going to put 184 now it's going to be the same situation as the stable cells in our UI tableview where we're going to have to adjust this height constraint based on

custom font and choose bold for the title maybe make it even a little larger let's say size 20 okay I want to park it underneath the webview so let's add some constraints to that guy uncheck constrain margins left let's say it's 20 right let's say it's 20 and you can see these numbers changing on me make sure it doesn't change on you and 20 there we go for the top I'm gonna park it against the webview so let's say it's 20 from the webview as well and we also have to give this guy a height so let's say 100 make sure it's got enough for a couple of lines maybe it's a three line video title for the description let's add some constraints for that uncheck constrain margins let's do left top and right so for the top I want to make sure it's parked against the title label let's say 20 and left this 20 and right is 20 as well so we're not gonna put a height for this guy so let's make sure that this description can be multiple lines as well by changing the number of lines to the zero okay now finally let's click this guy and update all frames let's choose an element first scroll down update frames for all views in the video detail controller okay so we've got them relatively in the places that we want that's the title label that's the description label which is going to fill up the bottom of the screen and we've got the web view here so let's go into the assistant editor and hook up these elements to our video detail view controller so I'm gonna hold down control click our web view and drag a line to create an iboutlet let me call this guy web view okay now let's do the same thing for the title label I call this the title label let's do it for the description let's call it the description label okay I'm gonna save it now let's go back to the standard editor or single

constraint margins let's so we can either choose top layout guide current distance it's 0 from top layout guide or we can choose it from the view but the current distance is 64 which I assume is that distance that covers the top bar so let's give that a try let's make it relative to the top of the view but with a 64 margin okay now let's give it a run and maybe that will work better for us okay so I think it did so the web view is right up against this edge here which is what we want when we actually put the video in there I don't think we'll be able to scroll so in the next lesson we're actually going to fill in the video we're gonna fill in the title in the description and we're gonna hook it up so that when we tap on a cell it actually passes the video we chose to the detail view so it knows what to display so I want to thank you watching and sticking around if you liked this video and you like the series please share it with your coworkers and friends please give me a like and a subscribe and we're nearly finished the app so I'll see you guys tomorrow at 12 talk to you later bye for now
