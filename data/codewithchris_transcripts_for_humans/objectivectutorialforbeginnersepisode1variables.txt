00:09 - hi welcome to code with Chris and this
00:11 - series is about learning objective c now
00:13 - this is a great place to start if you've
00:15 - already got a programming background and
00:17 - you just want to learn Objective C
00:19 - syntax and structure and so on and so
00:21 - forth if you have no programming
00:23 - experience at all this is still a great
00:25 - place to start but you might want to
00:27 - check out the post in the description
00:29 - below that post I introduce people who
00:31 - are non-programmers to Objective C so
00:34 - read that first and then watch this
00:36 - video if you've got no programming
00:37 - experience in this video we're going to
00:39 - be talking about some common objectiv C
00:41 - data types and showing you some examples
00:44 - here are some of the common data types
00:45 - that you'll be using short and int are
00:47 - to store integers depends what size you
00:49 - need chars store a single character and
00:53 - for Strings we have a class called NS
00:55 - string uh which we'll introduce in a
00:57 - later episode float and double our for
01:00 - your floating Point decimal numbers
01:02 - again depends on what size you need bull
01:05 - is to store your Boolean type variables
01:07 - so you can assign it no or yes or zero
01:10 - and one accordingly and ID is to store
01:13 - object and class references now it's not
01:16 - strongly typed so you can assign any
01:19 - object to a variable of this type now
01:21 - let's see some of these in action I've
01:24 - whipped up a quick project here to show
01:26 - you guys the variable declaration
01:27 - statements please ignore the warnings on
01:30 - the left hand side here it's xcode's
01:33 - just telling me that I'm declaring these
01:34 - variables but I'm not actually using
01:36 - them anywhere so it's telling me that I
01:38 - should delete them uh but anyways I've
01:41 - declared here basically the the data
01:44 - types that we talked about in the chart
01:45 - before you might notice that in this
01:47 - short variable I've assigned 60,000 to
01:50 - it but in the chart prior I said that
01:52 - the range of values is from- 32,000 and
01:55 - something to positive 32,000 well that
01:59 - really depends on on the size that your
02:01 - computer uses so if you're running a
02:02 - 64-bit machine then obviously the sizes
02:05 - are going to be uh increased some things
02:08 - I want to bring up are you can add
02:12 - unsigned to your variable and what this
02:16 - does is it drops the whole negative
02:18 - range and it doubles the positive range
02:20 - another thing I want to show you guys is
02:22 - the static keyword so if I add static in
02:24 - front of the variable declaration it's
02:26 - effectively going to turn that into a
02:28 - static variable meaning that the first
02:30 - time this method gets called this
02:32 - variable gets created uh but subsequent
02:35 - times it will not create that variable
02:37 - again and it will uh retain its value
02:40 - that you've set and then there's the
02:42 - constant keyword so if I wanted to
02:44 - declare a variable that I would assign a
02:47 - value and it would never change I could
02:49 - use the const keyword in front of my
02:52 - variable declaration and that would turn
02:54 - that into a constant notice that here
02:57 - with the ID variable declaration I'm
02:59 - assigning it a value of self and self is
03:02 - a keyword to indicate that particular
03:04 - instance so in this case self refers to
03:08 - this instance of the view controller hey
03:10 - guys so that was the first episode of
03:13 - the learn objective c tutorial series
03:15 - and now for your fun fact did you know
03:18 - that over 10% of iPhones in the world
03:20 - are jailbroken so my question to you is
03:23 - do you own one an iPhone or an iPad and
03:26 - did you jailbreak it let me know in the
03:28 - comment section below and I'll post the
03:30 - results in a future video all right see
03:32 - you guys
03:33 - [Music]
03:46 - later

hi welcome to code with Chris and this series is about learning objective c now this is a great place to start if you've already got a programming background and you just want to learn Objective C syntax and structure and so on and so forth if you have no programming experience at all this is still a great place to start but you might want to check out the post in the description below that post I introduce people who are nonprogrammers to Objective C so read that first and then watch this video if you've got no programming experience in this video we're going to be talking about some common objectiv C data types and showing you some examples here are some of the common data types that you'll be using short and int are to store integers depends what size you need chars store a single character and for Strings we have a class called NS string uh which we'll introduce in a later episode float and double our for your floating Point decimal numbers again depends on what size you need bull is to store your Boolean type variables so you can assign it no or yes or zero and one accordingly and ID is to store object and class references now it's not strongly typed so you can assign any object to a variable of this type now let's see some of these in action I've whipped up a quick project here to show you guys the variable declaration statements please ignore the warnings on the left hand side here it's xcode's just telling me that I'm declaring these variables but I'm not actually using them anywhere so it's telling me that I should delete them uh but anyways I've declared here basically the the data types that we talked about in the chart before you might notice that in this short variable I've assigned 60,000 to it but in the chart prior I said that the range of values is from 32,000 and something to positive 32,000 well that really depends on on the size that your computer uses so if you're running a 64bit machine then obviously the sizes are going to be uh increased some things I want to bring up are you can add unsigned to your variable and what this does is it drops the whole negative range and it doubles the positive range another thing I want to show you guys is the static keyword so if I add static in front of the variable declaration it's effectively going to turn that into a static variable meaning that the first time this method gets called this variable gets created uh but subsequent times it will not create that variable again and it will uh retain its value that you've set and then there's the constant keyword so if I wanted to declare a variable that I would assign a value and it would never change I could use the const keyword in front of my variable declaration and that would turn that into a constant notice that here with the ID variable declaration I'm assigning it a value of self and self is a keyword to indicate that particular instance so in this case self refers to this instance of the view controller hey guys so that was the first episode of the learn objective c tutorial series and now for your fun fact did you know that over 10% of iPhones in the world are jailbroken so my question to you is do you own one an iPhone or an iPad and did you jailbreak it let me know in the comment section below and I'll post the results in a future video all right see you guys later
