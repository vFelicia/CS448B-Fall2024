00:00 - should you create your user interface
00:01 - programmatically or with interface
00:03 - builder if you do a little bit of
00:05 - googling you'll be met with articles
00:07 - with headlines like these life without
00:10 - interface builder why I don't use
00:12 - storyboard why I fell out of love with
00:14 - storyboards you get the idea
00:16 - let me tell you I was a huge advocate of
00:19 - building the UI programmatically in fact
00:21 - in my last workplace I led the movement
00:23 - to build all of our UI programmatically
00:26 - for all of our projects but now I am a
00:28 - huge fan of interface builder and
00:30 - storyboards and in this video I'll tell
00:32 - you why
00:33 - I'll also tell you what you should be
00:34 - using depending on what type of person
00:36 - you are stay tuned
00:42 - welcome to code with Kris the place to
00:45 - be if you want to learn how to make an
00:46 - app I'm Kris and I'm so glad you're here
00:48 - now just in case you don't know what
00:50 - we're talking about in this video take a
00:52 - look at this button I can do it through
00:54 - code like this or I can do it through X
00:57 - codes visual interface builder which
01:00 - method is better well to answer that
01:01 - question we need to look at some cold
01:03 - hard facts number one it's tough to get
01:07 - the entire picture with interface
01:08 - builder Chris what are you talking about
01:10 - if laid out all there man yes but there
01:12 - are a ton of options check boxes and
01:15 - dropdowns and interface builder I have
01:16 - to click into every single element and
01:18 - look through all of these options just
01:21 - to see if you've changed anything and
01:23 - then don't forget for each element there
01:25 - is filled a size inspector and an
01:27 - identity inspector as well with the
01:30 - programmatic UI it's easy because I can
01:31 - just read every single line of code and
01:33 - I can see what you're changing to that
01:35 - element if you don't have a line of code
01:37 - changing a specific property for that
01:39 - element then I know that that value
01:41 - hasn't changed
01:42 - [Music]
01:44 - number 2 loading storyboards in Xcode is
01:47 - notoriously slow in Xcode when you try
01:50 - to open up a storyboard it's gonna take
01:52 - a couple of seconds to load before you
01:54 - can work with it and that wait time is
01:56 - gonna get longer as your storyboard gets
01:58 - more and more bloated now this issue can
02:00 - be lessened a little bit if you split
02:02 - your storyboards up into smaller
02:03 - storyboards what you should be doing
02:05 - anyways as a best practice when you're
02:07 - working with storyboards to be honest
02:09 - this isn't going to bug you much when
02:11 - you're a beginner but as your skill
02:13 - level gets higher and higher it's going
02:15 - to become increasingly frustrating
02:17 - because at that point Xcode can't keep
02:19 - up with you number three when you're
02:22 - working in a team it's easier to resolve
02:24 - conflicts with a programmatic UI if two
02:27 - people modified the same piece of code
02:29 - in the same file then you're going to
02:30 - get a conflict but that's alright
02:32 - because it's very easy to look at the
02:34 - two offending lines of code and decide
02:36 - how to merge them or which ones to keep
02:38 - with a conflict in the storyboard
02:40 - however you're going to be looking at
02:41 - two pieces of XML and you're gonna have
02:43 - to be able to interpret what they mean
02:45 - so you can decide how to resolve that
02:48 - conflict and reading and understanding
02:50 - that underlying XML of the storyboard is
02:52 - not easy because it's not always human
02:55 - readable so that adds to the difficulty
03:00 - okay so I know it's looking pretty bad
03:02 - for interface builder now but let's put
03:04 - some on the scoreboard for it shall we
03:06 - number four interface builder is faster
03:09 - for constructing a UI if you're building
03:11 - a UI from scratch and you're familiar
03:13 - with using interface builder I've got to
03:15 - say that specifying constraints in
03:17 - interface builder is a lot faster than
03:19 - having to type out all that code I mean
03:21 - take a look at me centering this button
03:23 - if I were to code these constraints out
03:25 - I'd have to type this there's an
03:26 - interesting video by Brian moon of let's
03:28 - build that app where he times himself
03:30 - building the same UI using interface
03:33 - builder and then again doing it purely
03:35 - in code I'm not gonna spoil it for you
03:37 - but do note that he is using some custom
03:39 - extensions that allow him to specify
03:41 - auto layout constraints in code without
03:43 - typing out that much code
03:46 - number five store boards are great at
03:49 - conveying a sense of the apps flow for a
03:52 - new person jumping onto an existing
03:54 - project glancing at the store board can
03:56 - tell a lot about how the screens flow
03:58 - from one to the next but if it's a
04:00 - purely coded UI you're gonna have to
04:02 - take a little more time to look at the
04:04 - code and understand what's going on so
04:07 - now you might be thinking programmatic
04:09 - UI is the winner well no it depends who
04:13 - you're talking to when I was learning
04:15 - Iowa's app development
04:16 - I found interface builder confusing and
04:18 - buggy I felt like I was at the mercy of
04:20 - its quirks and glitches do keep in mind
04:23 - that this was back in Xcode 3 and it's
04:24 - come a long way whereas when I wrote
04:26 - code to generate the UI I felt like I
04:28 - was in control and it felt like it I was
04:30 - at home so that's what I did I built all
04:33 - of my UI programmatically I think part
04:35 - of why it felt so natural to me was
04:37 - because I had a programming background
04:39 - that's what I did I wrote code for a
04:41 - living so I felt very comfortable with
04:43 - it since I was the first and only person
04:45 - at the company who worked with iOS as
04:47 - our team grew everyone followed the same
04:50 - trend they built all of the UI
04:52 - programmatically that is until one day
04:54 - Kiev ash came in he was trained in the
04:57 - ways of the storyboard and poor guy he
04:59 - didn't stand a chance his arguments for
05:02 - using interface builder and storyboards
05:04 - Justin holed up against the rest of us I
05:06 - think we were about six guys at that
05:09 - point so it was six versus one in the
05:11 - end we converted him and he had to work
05:13 - our way because that's the way the rest
05:15 - of the team was doing it when I left the
05:17 - company to teach iOS I realized what a
05:19 - godsend storyboards an interface builder
05:21 - was try telling someone who's never
05:24 - written a single line of code that in
05:26 - order to put a button on the screen they
05:28 - had to type this out I began to realize
05:30 - that for beginners with no programming
05:31 - experience learning how to code is
05:34 - frigging intimidating and it's hugely
05:37 - psychological as well it's like when
05:39 - they start out they have this breaking
05:41 - point and each time they get frustrated
05:42 - it builds up if they reach this breaking
05:45 - point they just give up and they abandon
05:47 - learning iOS however as the learner
05:49 - makes small wins and little
05:50 - accomplishment that tolerance gets
05:52 - higher and higher until they have gone
05:54 - deep enough and they start to find it
05:56 - fun then that's when the breaking point
05:59 - disappears
06:00 - all together so that's why I use
06:02 - storyboards an interface builder in all
06:04 - of my teaching because most of my
06:05 - audience is just starting out and I know
06:08 - they're going to eventually reach a
06:09 - point where they're comfortable with
06:10 - code and then they can start learning to
06:13 - build their user interfaces
06:14 - programmatically in fact in all of
06:16 - apples beginner guides they use
06:18 - storyboards as well so back to the
06:20 - original question should you build your
06:22 - user interface programmatically or with
06:25 - interface builder if you're a beginner
06:27 - who has never coded before start with
06:29 - storyboards if you're a beginner in iOS
06:32 - development but you have prior coding
06:34 - experience start with programmatic UI I
06:36 - think you'll feel much more at home if
06:38 - you're working in a team environment you
06:40 - have to roll with whatever technique
06:42 - that project is using but if it's a
06:44 - fresh project I would recommend the
06:46 - programmatic method this also implies
06:48 - that you need to know how to work with
06:49 - both the programmatic approach and the
06:52 - storyboard approach and finally if
06:54 - you're working solo then do whatever
06:55 - makes you happy
06:56 - and don't forget it doesn't have to be
06:59 - so black and white if you're working on
07:01 - a solo project and you feel a lot more
07:03 - comfortable with storyboards go ahead
07:05 - you do you and if you want to do a
07:07 - little bit of programmatic UI with a
07:08 - little bit of storyboard you can do that
07:10 - too
07:11 - in fact Shaun Allen has this method
07:13 - called skeletal storyboards go check out
07:15 - that video now if you want to learn iOS
07:17 - development with a step-by-step plan
07:19 - using storyboards then you have to check
07:21 - out my beginner playlist just click on
07:24 - that short playlist that you see on your
07:25 - screen right there and I'll see you over
07:27 - in those videos okay and that's a wrap

Cleaned transcript:

should you create your user interface programmatically or with interface builder if you do a little bit of googling you'll be met with articles with headlines like these life without interface builder

should be using depending on what type of person you are stay tuned welcome to code with Kris the place to be if you want to learn how to make an app I'm Kris and I'm so glad you're here now just in case you don't know what we're talking about in this video take a look at this button I can do it through code like this or I can do it through X codes visual interface builder which method is better well to answer that question we need to look at some cold hard facts number one it's tough to get the entire picture with interface builder Chris what are you talking about if laid out all there man
