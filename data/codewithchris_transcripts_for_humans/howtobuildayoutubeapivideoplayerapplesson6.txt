With timestamps:

00:00 - in the last lesson we parsed the Json data 
returned by the YouTube API into video instances  
00:05 - that we're displaying in our feed view if you 
miss that lesson check out the playlist right  
00:09 - over there now the problem is we don't have any 
video thumbnails to show and we're going to fix  
00:14 - that in this lesson let's do it so here's what we 
have so far with our feed view let's clean this up  
00:20 - a bit so we're going to go into feed View and the 
first thing I'm going to do is change the style of  
00:27 - the list uh list style to to plane and then we're 
also going to remove the scroll indicator so let's  
00:37 - do that scroll indicators we're going to hide that 
and it should already look a little better perfect  
00:48 - and then we are going to remove these separators 
between each item because these are going to be um  
00:55 - images right thumbnails so in in the text here 
I'm going to say row separator visibility is  
01:04 - hidden and the other thing is remember how we 
have a tab view in the home view so let's add  
01:12 - that tab icon right there so in home view we can 
remove this on up here display our API key and  
01:24 - add a tab item and in here we are going to put an 
image and and this is going to be an S SF uh icon  
01:35 - SF symbol sorry and we are going to use stack 
this one play Square stack let's just see if I  
01:43 - can put it right there oh it just did the whole 
thing for me and then the text is going to be
01:51 - feed that already is going to look a lot 
better I hope you're enjoying the lesson so far  
02:00 - now just in case you want to launch your own app 
I want to tell you about cc+ this step-by-step  
02:05 - program will help you launch your own app even 
if you don't have any experience and it takes  
02:09 - about 4 months if this sounds like something 
you're interested in I have a special offer for  
02:14 - you I'll leave the link in the description below 
this video and hopefully I'll see you there if  
02:19 - not no worries I really appreciate that you're 
here watching this lesson and learning with us  
02:24 - so thank you for that anyways now back to the 
lesson now let's take a look at displaying those  
02:30 - images using our video row view so instead of 
displaying a text with the title we are going  
02:38 - to want to create instances of video row view 
but we need to pass the video into the video  
02:44 - row view otherwise this view won't have anything 
to work with so why don't we create a property  
02:54 - here that will need to get passed in and for 
this purpose Maybe we will just do that um
03:05 - from yeah I don't want to create all of that 
I'm just going to a the preview itself okay and  
03:18 - let's go back to feed View and we are going to 
pass it in here see now it requires that we're  
03:24 - going to just pass in the video that it's trying 
to display now now in the video row view let's  
03:33 - display the image now remember we do have the URL 
to thumbnail image it is inside video. snippet do  
03:43 - thumbnails medium. URL this is a string so we need 
to essentially hit this URL to download the image  
03:54 - data and then display that image data inside a 
Swift image luckily for us Swift uui makes this  
04:02 - really easy using async image where you just pass 
in a URL and it's going to do that asynchronously  
04:09 - it's going to send a background worker to go to 
that URL fetch the image data come back and then  
04:14 - display it inside an image we're going to use 
this one because it gives us a reference to the  
04:22 - Swift UI image view which allows us to add some 
additional modifiers to it if we want to like  
04:27 - tweak the corners we want to tweak the aspect 
ratio we can do that and placeholder allows  
04:33 - you to specify what to show while that background 
worker is grabbing the image data so we're going  
04:38 - to show a spinner and obviously URL is where the 
uh where should it go retrieve that now because  
04:46 - all of these are optional we may not have an 
image URL so we have to check for that first  
04:52 - so we're going to say if let URL equals and we're 
going to try to create a URL instance off of that
05:00 - string okay and if it is able to create this 
then we are going to pass this into the async  
05:12 - image call or sorry view as a parameter that's 
where we're going to pass that okay so what is  
05:19 - the String again well it is video. snippit do 
thumbnails medium. URL and if if it doesn't  
05:30 - exist um then it doesn't exist then we can't show 
an image so what do we have to do here to provide  
05:40 - optional default when the optional contains nil 
oh okay because it must be a string so yes if  
05:50 - any of this part isn't a URL if it cannot create 
this string then we're just going to put put an  
05:59 - empty string and try to create a URL and it's 
going to fail and it's going to not do any of  
06:04 - this stuff in here okay so now let's set our 
async image we're going to use this one right  
06:11 - here as I said and we're going to pass in the URL 
that was created and then we are going to double  
06:18 - click here and this is the image this is the 
reference to the image that will get displayed  
06:24 - once the data comes back so this is the image 
that is displayed and this placeholder we have  
06:33 - another handy Swift UI view we can use is progress 
view which is just going to be a spinner okay so  
06:40 - regarding this image right here we definitely 
want to add a couple of modifiers to it for  
06:47 - example resizable um so that it can scale up or 
down and we want to maintain the aspect ratio so  
06:55 - the one that I like to use is well it depends on 
the circumstances why don't we just try fill for  
07:03 - now and we'll see what happens and let's also 
um give it a little bit of a rounded corner so  
07:11 - we're going to do clip shape we're going to say 
rounded rectangle Corner radius is 10 all right  
07:18 - now let's see if this works we're going to go 
back to feed just double check okay it's going  
07:22 - to create instances of video r view and pass in 
the video and then this should download the images  
07:31 - we're not showing the titles here actually 
all right well that was pretty easy you have  
07:37 - to admit just like that we have this if you 
wanted to display the titles you would um you  
07:47 - can either display it well the titles don't 
depend on the image right so you could put  
07:54 - all of this inside a vstack and then put the title 
underneath for example so we could try to do that
08:01 - here and this would be the title right 
video. tile and then we can even make  
08:13 - it bold is it not title oh sorry snippet do 
tile and if it doesn't exist we'll show empty
08:24 - string yeah so we can left align 
it we can add some padding for
08:31 - example leading and then you could add just 
some padding overall or just maybe just to the
08:45 - vertical okay the corners are a little bit too 
rounded for my liking so we'll just do five all  
09:05 - right and that's how easy it is to do that all 
right our feed view looks pretty good all we  
09:11 - need to do is allow users to tap on the thumbnails 
to watch the video now you do know what I'm going  
09:16 - to ask you right if you've been enjoying this 
build please give this video a thumbs up and  
09:21 - if you've been following along and you are able 
to get your thumbnail images to show up please  
09:25 - comment down below piece of cake all right thanks 
for watching and I'll see you in the next lesson
