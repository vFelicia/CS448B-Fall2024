00:06 - hey everyone welcome to lesson 17 of how
00:08 - to make iPhone apps with no programming
00:11 - experience in this lesson we're going to
00:13 - finish off our war card game we're very
00:16 - close all we have to do is update the
00:18 - score labels so we're going to open up
00:20 - our xcode project and do that now here I
00:23 - am looking at the viewcontroller.swift
00:25 - and just to review we did add a couple
00:30 - of IB Outlets to connect uh these labels
00:35 - in our storyboard to the left score
00:36 - label and the right score label uh and
00:40 - just to remind you what they look like
00:41 - let's jump into the storyboard very
00:43 - quickly
00:45 - here there they are those two zeros and
00:49 - we are going to update those score
00:51 - labels so first of all what we need to
00:53 - do is declare two variables in order to
00:56 - track the scores um they need to be
00:59 - integers so we can increment them so I'm
01:02 - just going to keep things together let's
01:05 - let's do some organization here I'm
01:07 - going to cut and paste
01:09 - that right here and for the right side
01:13 - I'm going to put that right there and
01:16 - underneath here I'm going to call it the
01:18 - right score is an integer just assign
01:23 - zero into it our left score equals
01:28 - zero okay okay so what we're going to do
01:33 - down here is if the left card wins we're
01:37 - going to say left scores plus equals 1
01:41 - and that's going to add one to the left
01:45 - score and if the right card
01:48 - wins I'm going to do right score plus
01:52 - equal
01:53 - 1 and if it's a tie I'm not going to do
01:56 - anything if the left card wins now we
01:59 - got to up update the label okay
02:02 - so let's just write a comment here
02:04 - update the
02:06 - label and here increment the
02:11 - score so update the label we have the
02:15 - left score
02:16 - label and the label has a property
02:19 - called text and we pass a string into
02:23 - this text property in order to update it
02:26 - so I need to pass in left score but the
02:30 - problem here you can see is that left
02:33 - score is an integer and this text
02:36 - property expects a piece of text or a
02:40 - string uh we can easily convert this
02:42 - integer into a string just like we
02:45 - converted the
02:46 - uint up here generated by Arc for random
02:50 - uniform into an integer type we're going
02:54 - to do the same thing here we're going to
02:55 - convert this number left score into a
02:59 - string data type and then we can assign
03:02 - it to the text property of the label
03:05 - okay so let's do something in here
03:07 - increment the
03:09 - score and here update the label so
03:16 - write score label. text equals
03:20 - string
03:22 - write score like
03:25 - that all right so that should do it
03:29 - let's run our
03:31 - app and let's see it in
03:36 - action all right let's click the deal
03:38 - button so right card wins CPU gets one
03:44 - king beats four player gets one and five
03:49 - beats three so player gets two
03:52 - so this situation here um this situation
03:57 - here we might want to change because if
03:59 - Ace probably should be the highest card
04:02 - but right now the
04:04 - ace is at the first index of our array
04:09 - so it's pretty much got an index of zero
04:13 - in this case the number two beats Ace
04:16 - number three beats Ace everything beats
04:18 - Ace because Ace is zero King is 12 if we
04:22 - want the ace to be the highest
04:25 - card want it to have kind of trump
04:28 - everything we can simp simply move that
04:30 - value up here now Ace is the biggest
04:33 - card and two is the smallest card so
04:37 - simply by doing that now Ace beats
04:42 - everything all right so there you have
04:44 - it that's our completed war card game
04:49 - application let me just run it
04:51 - again and I hope you guys learned a lot
04:54 - I hope you had fun building this project
04:57 - with me if you did please share your
05:00 - results on Twitter and spread the word
05:03 - share these free lessons with anyone you
05:05 - know who is interested with the work
05:07 - hard game and if you enjoyed this
05:09 - project chances are you will probably
05:11 - enjoy the course I'm offering as well uh
05:14 - where we're going to build multiple apps
05:16 - together each one with varying or
05:19 - increasing complexity uh to build upon
05:22 - the skills that you learned with this
05:23 - project so take a look at that too if
05:26 - you're interested thanks for learning
05:28 - with me I really appreciate it and I'll
05:30 - see you guys next time bye for now
