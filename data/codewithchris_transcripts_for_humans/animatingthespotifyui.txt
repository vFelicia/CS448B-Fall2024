00:00 - in this lesson we'll learn how to
00:02 - animate between two screens and figma
00:04 - using smart animate hello and welcome
00:06 - back for another video so in our
00:08 - previous lesson we recreated spotify's
00:10 - media player so to pick up where we left
00:12 - off we'll recreate the lyric screen and
00:15 - from there we'll learn how to
00:17 - animate between the media player and the
00:19 - expanded lyric screen that will design
00:21 - later on so this is going to be a very
00:23 - fun lesson so let's get started
00:26 - so to give you a little bit of
00:27 - information and background about our
00:29 - smart animate works in sigma you need to
00:31 - have two or more different states so
00:33 - that can be two screens two frames and
00:35 - so on basically you need to have a
00:37 - starting point and an end point
00:40 - so if we duplicate our frame here
00:43 - and change the position of this element
00:45 - to the center
00:46 - just like that and change its size
00:49 - if we enable the smart animate
00:51 - transition here so just drag this circle
00:54 - to the screen 4 and make sure smart
00:56 - animate is selected
00:59 - basically once we do this um figma will
01:02 - automatically calculate the difference
01:04 - between the two states as well as
01:06 - automatically create a smooth transition
01:08 - between these two for you so now here's
01:10 - the catch smart animate emulates um css
01:13 - transitions one to one so it's very
01:15 - important that the layering and the
01:17 - naming of your elements are the same
01:20 - across multiple frames or multiple
01:22 - screens
01:23 - so as you can see
01:25 - screen 1 is named circle basically all
01:27 - this our name circle just like that all
01:30 - elements are named circle however screen
01:32 - 2 is spelled incorrectly as you can see
01:34 - it's c-r-i-c-l-c-l-e
01:37 - so we won't change that but i'm going to
01:39 - give you an example as to why this won't
01:41 - work
01:42 - so if we play select play
01:45 - so this is screen 1
01:46 - and when we press screen 2
01:49 - the transition is not seamless however
01:52 - if we go to screen 3 and screen 4 you
01:54 - can see that the transition is very
01:56 - seamless it's very smooth and there's
01:58 - some sort of logic between this screen 3
02:01 - to screen 4. so like i said the reason
02:03 - why this flow 1 this screen 1 screen 2
02:06 - doesn't have a smooth transition is
02:08 - because screen 2
02:10 - is misspelled the element here is
02:13 - misspelled so because of this figma
02:15 - won't be able to calculate properly the
02:17 - difference between circle and this
02:19 - element that's spelled incorrectly so
02:21 - take note that when you are
02:24 - applying smart animate for your um
02:26 - designs you need to make sure that the
02:28 - structure
02:29 - and
02:30 - the naming of your elements are exactly
02:34 - the same so to remedy this you just need
02:37 - to make sure that to duplicate the
02:39 - screen and not recreate another screen
02:42 - from scratch because if you recreate
02:43 - another screen from scratch you are
02:45 - running the risk of not being able to
02:48 - smart animate properly so that's one
02:50 - thing to take note of so with that out
02:52 - of the way let's proceed to creating the
02:54 - design for this expanded lyric section
02:56 - so let's just duplicate this
02:59 - and let's remove and we'll use this as
03:01 - the reference material so
03:03 - let's just remove this image for now
03:06 - group one
03:07 - let's remove this let's just drag it
03:09 - here
03:11 - so we'll see we'll use this as reference
03:14 - from here we'll just delete this
03:17 - oops we won't delete this by the way and
03:19 - we'll just adjust the properties so so
03:22 - for the image we'll resize it to
03:23 - something smaller maybe 20
03:26 - or maybe 50 and then we'll adjust the
03:28 - stroke to maybe 5
03:31 - or even 2 something like that so that's
03:34 - enough
03:35 - and we'll remove this header as well
03:37 - and sunday morning maroon 5 let's remove
03:40 - this
03:41 - and just drag it here
03:50 - and adjust the properties
03:52 - to something like
03:58 - that
04:01 - so we just adjust the properties of this
04:03 - text as well so 18 let's make it 14
04:07 - and this one will be 12 or even 11
04:11 - and we'll adjust the spacing between
04:13 - these two
04:17 - or
04:18 - yeah i think they're already good
04:19 - they're already zero so we'll just
04:21 - change the um
04:24 - to packed and then
04:26 - let's just
04:28 - adjust the padding to 100 or something
04:31 - like that
04:33 - and 20
04:34 - or that's good
04:36 - let's just keep this because we still
04:38 - have the pause button so let's remove
04:40 - the shuffle so let's just click this
04:43 - icon
04:44 - and then click on this icon as well
04:46 - click on the repeat and click on this
04:48 - eye icon as well
04:50 - and same goes for the other elements
04:52 - just like that so we won't be
04:54 - necessarily deleting them from the our
04:57 - layers panel we'll just make them
04:59 - disappear for now
05:02 - and then from there
05:05 - we will remove this as well
05:08 - and this one
05:10 - just like that
05:12 - and let's copy this
05:15 - and just like that
05:20 - and from here let's
05:23 - bring back the
05:24 - shuffle button
05:26 - make it appear like that let's just make
05:28 - it zero
05:30 - so we'll still have the play or rather
05:33 - the pause icon in the middle and the
05:36 - share
05:36 - icon on the side
05:39 - so it's here okay
05:42 - so from there we'll just delete this
05:46 - we'll just resize this lyric's master
05:48 - frame and make it full page but before
05:50 - we do that we need to make sure that
05:52 - this sunday morning text let's uh we
05:54 - won't rename this because it contains
05:57 - the same um
05:58 - layer name from screen one so we won't
06:01 - be renaming anything here to make sure
06:02 - that smart animate works so we'll just
06:04 - make sure that frame three
06:07 - is on the
06:09 - top layer as well as the image one
06:14 - so from there
06:16 - we'll just make sure that this lyrics
06:18 - frame will
06:20 - cover all the screen from top to bottom
06:24 - so let's just
06:26 - adjust it from here let's choose make
06:28 - sure to choose the lyrics frame and from
06:30 - there
06:31 - we'll adjust the size
06:33 - just like that make it snap
06:37 - zoom in if you want to
06:39 - get closer
06:42 - just like that
06:45 - so when in doubt you can just adjust it
06:47 - via here so to make more precise
06:50 - adjustments
06:51 - via the numbers
06:53 - so just like that i think we're all good
06:57 - so from here
06:58 - we'll be adjusting the properties of
07:01 - this text
07:03 - so
07:04 - this will be lyrics master
07:07 - make sure to select frame 16 because
07:09 - this contains this is the frame that
07:10 - contains the text or the lyrics itself
07:13 - so
07:14 - make sure to adjust the
07:16 - um padding tap top padding to maybe 44
07:20 - or 100
07:22 - even 200 or something like that
07:24 - or even
07:26 - 164 is a good then from there let's make
07:29 - sure it's 20
07:33 - or even
07:34 - 40
07:36 - or 32 that's closer
07:41 - and make sure to make it snap to the
07:43 - right
07:45 - and from here we'll remove this more
07:48 - icon
07:50 - just make it invisible
07:53 - and the lyrics as well basically this on
07:56 - frame 15 will make it disappear
08:00 - just like that
08:02 - so from here we'll also remove the
08:04 - gradient layer because
08:07 - we don't need it anymore
08:09 - and the share
08:10 - icon we don't need it as well
08:14 - let's make sure
08:15 - to make it invisible
08:18 - from there
08:19 - we'll just google sunday morning lyrics
08:21 - again
08:26 - let's just copy this
08:28 - and go back
08:32 - and paste everything else
08:34 - so as you can see we still have a lot of
08:36 - space here and i just realized that we
08:38 - don't have the media player and the
08:41 - scroll bar here and the reason is
08:43 - because it's in the bottom it's behind
08:46 - this frame layer so we need to make sure
08:48 - to put them on the front or on top
08:52 - so let's just find it so press on this
08:55 - frame and it's named as frame four and
08:58 - this one is named frame six so we'll
09:00 - look for frame four and frame six on our
09:02 - screen to frame and make sure to select
09:04 - them both by holding on command or
09:06 - control then once you've selected them
09:08 - both make sure to hold command option
09:11 - and right bracket
09:12 - and then from there
09:14 - they will just show up just like that
09:18 - now we have our media player
09:20 - so just make sure to adjust the
09:23 - properties of this um
09:25 - scroll bar
09:27 - so we'll just change this to maybe
09:30 - something lighter
09:32 - just like that
09:34 - maybe 50
09:36 - and cool that's all good
09:40 - and i think
09:42 - we also need to look for frame five
09:44 - which contains our timestamps so look
09:46 - for frame five under screen two
09:49 - this is it
09:50 - as you can see it's highlighted here so
09:52 - press command option right bracket as
09:54 - well you can see it just pop up just
09:56 - like that and put it right below this
10:00 - scroll bar
10:02 - just like that make sure it snaps
10:04 - and change the um
10:06 - color of this as well to something
10:09 - that's similar so this is
10:11 - e9e9e9 let's just copy paste that color
10:15 - property
10:16 - make sure it's the same
10:18 - just like that
10:20 - oh double check so these three stacks on
10:22 - top of each other perfectly so that's
10:25 - all good
10:26 - and let's just make sure
10:31 - that this will
10:32 - snap just like that as well
10:35 - and from here we still have enough space
10:37 - here so let's just remove
10:40 - this by dragging up the canvas or the
10:43 - frame and also the home indicator needs
10:45 - to be on top as well so we can see that
10:48 - and also this status bar
10:50 - that just like that so we can have a
10:52 - better scale or understanding of our ui
10:55 - so from here
10:56 - um let's just select them all
10:58 - option l
11:01 - hold
11:02 - suck them all
11:05 - and just make sure that this will snap
11:08 - right here
11:09 - so from here we also have enough space
11:12 - on the top
11:13 - so let's just select this too
11:15 - and drag it make sure just
11:18 - make sure to that it will snap on this
11:21 - um status bar area and from here
11:24 - we also still have enough space
11:27 - and as you can see our frame bounding
11:28 - box isn't properly covering our text
11:32 - to do that just click on this resize to
11:34 - fit
11:35 - and just like that it's now showing
11:37 - properly so let's just resize it
11:40 - as well
11:42 - and just like that that's our lyrics
11:44 - master
11:46 - so let's adjust this um
11:50 - frame 16
11:53 - make sure
11:55 - we can adjust this further maybe 120
11:58 - oops
12:00 - 120
12:01 - and
12:02 - that's all good
12:04 - 132. all right that's all good
12:07 - i think that's about it we just need to
12:09 - have the x icon so let's look for icons
12:12 - eight
12:13 - or your icons plugin of choice i'll look
12:16 - for the close icon
12:19 - in ios
12:23 - not go as close
12:25 - so from here we'll just change the color
12:28 - to something like set major to choose
12:30 - selection colors something white
12:32 - and then just drag it here and resize it
12:35 - to maybe 24 our usual sizes or maybe 32
12:40 - or even 44.
12:42 - yeah that's good so it's not the same as
12:45 - the spotify ui i think this is a
12:47 - proprietary or this is a custom icon
12:50 - that spotify itself designed so
12:53 - we don't have that in our plugin so it's
12:56 - okay
12:57 - this is the best thing that we can find
13:00 - so just like that
13:03 - just drag it here maybe make sure that
13:05 - it will be inside the frame 3
13:10 - or not because
13:12 - it's not in this as you can see right
13:13 - here it's not in the same box or same
13:17 - row so it's okay if it's just above
13:19 - sitting above this
13:21 - frame so if we close this
13:23 - and click on screen two
13:26 - you can see mac os close
13:28 - oops mac os close is
13:31 - sitting will be sitting on the top just
13:34 - like that
13:36 - all right that's good
13:39 - so let's double check on our um frames
13:42 - icons so from here our expanded lyric
13:44 - section is done so next thing to do is
13:46 - to make sure to enable smart animate so
13:48 - let's
13:49 - click on prototype on the right side
13:52 - so you can choose whichever element but
13:54 - i think i'd prefer this one either the
13:56 - lyrics or the more so let's choose the
13:58 - lyrics here
14:00 - make sure that the lyrics section is
14:01 - selected
14:02 - and then drag this circle and the arrow
14:05 - to here to the next frame make sure
14:07 - smart animate is enabled and ease out
14:10 - or maybe even ease in
14:14 - from there all we need to do is press
14:16 - play
14:20 - and
14:21 - as you can see right here is our screen
14:23 - one and if we click lyrics
14:26 - just like that our lyrics expanded
14:29 - beautifully expanded seamlessly
14:31 - so let's go back to our canvas
14:34 - so if you click x and click here and
14:36 - drag it here
14:37 - it will go back to our media player
14:39 - basically that's basically closing our
14:41 - lyric expanded lyric section so this
14:43 - will be ease in this will be this should
14:45 - be ease out
14:48 - and this will be ease in
14:50 - all right so let's read this
14:52 - prototype again so click on screen one
14:55 - click on play
14:56 - so let's scroll down and click on lyrics
15:00 - and that's a beautiful transition very
15:01 - seamless and then let's click with our
15:04 - new animation let's click close or the x
15:07 - and just like that so let's do it again
15:10 - and this one it's a very seamless
15:13 - beautiful transition
15:15 - and yeah that's all done with smart
15:18 - animate on figma so remember when using
15:20 - smart animate duplicate the screen and
15:23 - don't try to like recreate everything
15:25 - from scratch because that will just mess
15:27 - up how smart animate works
15:30 - alright so that's our two part lesson on
15:32 - recreating and animating this spotify ui
15:35 - all in figma so this is just the tip of
15:37 - the iceberg on when it comes to learning
15:39 - figmas prototyping and
15:42 - animation features so if you are
15:44 - interested to know more about it make
15:46 - sure to stay tuned for future lessons in
15:48 - the meantime i hope the past two lessons
15:50 - have inspired you to explore figma on
15:52 - your own and recreate apps that you like
15:55 - for practice figma is a very
15:57 - beginner-friendly tool and we highly
15:58 - recommend using it when learning how to
16:00 - design uis so as usual the resource file
16:03 - for this lesson is in the description if
16:05 - you want to further study the design
16:06 - file yourself and if you have any
16:09 - questions feel free to post in the code
16:10 - group forum and i'll be happy to help
16:13 - again make sure to keep on practicing
16:14 - your design and figma skills because i
16:16 - know i will and it would mean a lot if
16:18 - you would too with those things said i
16:20 - hope you learned something and i'll see
16:22 - you in the next lesson

Cleaned transcript:

in this lesson we'll learn how to animate between two screens and figma using smart animate hello and welcome back for another video so in our previous lesson we recreated spotify's media player so to pick up where we left off we'll recreate the lyric screen and from there we'll learn how to animate between the media player and the expanded lyric screen that will design later on so this is going to be a very fun lesson so let's get started so to give you a little bit of information and background about our smart animate works in sigma you need to have two or more different states so that can be two screens two frames and so on basically you need to have a starting point and an end point so if we duplicate our frame here and change the position of this element to the center just like that and change its size if we enable the smart animate transition here so just drag this circle to the screen 4 and make sure smart animate is selected basically once we do this um figma will automatically calculate the difference between the two states as well as automatically create a smooth transition between these two for you so now here's the catch smart animate emulates um css transitions one to one so it's very important that the layering and the naming of your elements are the same across multiple frames or multiple screens so as you can see screen 1 is named circle basically all this our name circle just like that all elements are named circle however screen 2 is spelled incorrectly as you can see it's criclcle so we won't change that but i'm going to give you an example as to why this won't work so if we play select play so this is screen 1 and when we press screen 2 the transition is not seamless however if we go to screen 3 and screen 4 you can see that the transition is very seamless it's very smooth and there's some sort of logic between this screen 3 to screen 4. so like i said the reason why this flow 1 this screen 1 screen 2 doesn't have a smooth transition is because screen 2 is misspelled the element here is misspelled so because of this figma won't be able to calculate properly the difference between circle and this element that's spelled incorrectly so take note that when you are applying smart animate for your um designs you need to make sure that the structure and the naming of your elements are exactly the same so to remedy this you just need to make sure that to duplicate the screen and not recreate another screen from scratch because if you recreate another screen from scratch you are running the risk of not being able to smart animate properly so that's one thing to take note of so with that out of the way let's proceed to creating the design for this expanded lyric section so let's just duplicate this and let's remove and we'll use this as the reference material so let's just remove this image for now group one let's remove this let's just drag it here so we'll see we'll use this as reference from here we'll just delete this oops we won't delete this by the way and we'll just adjust the properties so so for the image we'll resize it to something smaller maybe 20 or maybe 50 and then we'll adjust the stroke to maybe 5 or even 2 something like that so that's enough and we'll remove this header as well and sunday morning maroon 5 let's remove this and just drag it here and adjust the properties to something like that so we just adjust the properties of this text as well so 18 let's make it 14 and this one will be 12 or even 11 and we'll adjust the spacing between these two or yeah i think they're already good they're already zero so we'll just change the um to packed and then let's just adjust the padding to 100 or something like that and 20 or that's good let's just keep this because we still have the pause button so let's remove the shuffle so let's just click this icon and then click on this icon as well click on the repeat and click on this eye icon as well and same goes for the other elements just like that so we won't be necessarily deleting them from the our layers panel we'll just make them disappear for now and then from there we will remove this as well and this one just like that and let's copy this and just like that and from here let's bring back the shuffle button make it appear like that let's just make it zero so we'll still have the play or rather the pause icon in the middle and the share icon on the side so it's here okay so from there we'll just delete this we'll just resize this lyric's master frame and make it full page but before we do that we need to make sure that this sunday morning text let's uh we won't rename this because it contains the same um layer name from screen one so we won't be renaming anything here to make sure that smart animate works so we'll just make sure that frame three is on the top layer as well as the image one so from there we'll just make sure that this lyrics frame will cover all the screen from top to bottom so let's just adjust it from here let's choose make sure to choose the lyrics frame and from there we'll adjust the size just like that make it snap zoom in if you want to get closer just like that so when in doubt you can just adjust it via here so to make more precise adjustments via the numbers so just like that i think we're all good so from here we'll be adjusting the properties of this text so this will be lyrics master make sure to select frame 16 because this contains this is the frame that contains the text or the lyrics itself so make sure to adjust the um padding tap top padding to maybe 44 or 100 even 200 or something like that or even 164 is a good then from there let's make sure it's 20 or even 40 or 32 that's closer and make sure to make it snap to the right and from here we'll remove this more icon just make it invisible and the lyrics as well basically this on frame 15 will make it disappear just like that so from here we'll also remove the gradient layer because we don't need it anymore and the share icon we don't need it as well let's make sure to make it invisible from there we'll just google sunday morning lyrics again let's just copy this and go back and paste everything else so as you can see we still have a lot of space here and i just realized that we don't have the media player and the scroll bar here and the reason is because it's in the bottom it's behind this frame layer so we need to make sure to put them on the front or on top so let's just find it so press on this frame and it's named as frame four and this one is named frame six so we'll look for frame four and frame six on our screen to frame and make sure to select them both by holding on command or control then once you've selected them both make sure to hold command option and right bracket and then from there they will just show up just like that now we have our media player so just make sure to adjust the properties of this um scroll bar so we'll just change this to maybe something lighter just like that maybe 50 and cool that's all good and i think we also need to look for frame five which contains our timestamps so look for frame five under screen two this is it as you can see it's highlighted here so press command option right bracket as well you can see it just pop up just like that and put it right below this scroll bar just like that make sure it snaps and change the um color of this as well to something that's similar so this is e9e9e9 let's just copy paste that color property make sure it's the same just like that oh double check so these three stacks on top of each other perfectly so that's all good and let's just make sure that this will snap just like that as well and from here we still have enough space here so let's just remove this by dragging up the canvas or the frame and also the home indicator needs to be on top as well so we can see that and also this status bar that just like that so we can have a better scale or understanding of our ui so from here um let's just select them all option l hold suck them all and just make sure that this will snap right here so from here we also have enough space on the top so let's just select this too and drag it make sure just make sure to that it will snap on this um status bar area and from here we also still have enough space and as you can see our frame bounding box isn't properly covering our text to do that just click on this resize to fit and just like that it's now showing properly so let's just resize it as well and just like that that's our lyrics master so let's adjust this um frame 16 make sure we can adjust this further maybe 120 oops 120 and that's all good 132. all right that's all good i think that's about it we just need to have the x icon so let's look for icons eight or your icons plugin of choice i'll look for the close icon in ios not go as close so from here we'll just change the color to something like set major to choose selection colors something white and then just drag it here and resize it to maybe 24 our usual sizes or maybe 32 or even 44. yeah that's good so it's not the same as the spotify ui i think this is a proprietary or this is a custom icon that spotify itself designed so we don't have that in our plugin so it's okay this is the best thing that we can find so just like that just drag it here maybe make sure that it will be inside the frame 3 or not because it's not in this as you can see right here it's not in the same box or same row so it's okay if it's just above sitting above this frame so if we close this and click on screen two you can see mac os close oops mac os close is sitting will be sitting on the top just like that all right that's good so let's double check on our um frames icons so from here our expanded lyric section is done so next thing to do is to make sure to enable smart animate so let's click on prototype on the right side so you can choose whichever element but i think i'd prefer this one either the lyrics or the more so let's choose the lyrics here make sure that the lyrics section is selected and then drag this circle and the arrow to here to the next frame make sure smart animate is enabled and ease out or maybe even ease in from there all we need to do is press play and as you can see right here is our screen one and if we click lyrics just like that our lyrics expanded beautifully expanded seamlessly so let's go back to our canvas so if you click x and click here and drag it here it will go back to our media player basically that's basically closing our lyric expanded lyric section so this will be ease in this will be this should be ease out and this will be ease in all right so let's read this prototype again so click on screen one click on play so let's scroll down and click on lyrics and that's a beautiful transition very seamless and then let's click with our new animation let's click close or the x and just like that so let's do it again and this one it's a very seamless beautiful transition and yeah that's all done with smart animate on figma so remember when using smart animate duplicate the screen and don't try to like recreate everything from scratch because that will just mess up how smart animate works alright so that's our two part lesson on recreating and animating this spotify ui all in figma so this is just the tip of the iceberg on when it comes to learning figmas prototyping and animation features so if you are interested to know more about it make sure to stay tuned for future lessons in the meantime i hope the past two lessons have inspired you to explore figma on your own and recreate apps that you like for practice figma is a very beginnerfriendly tool and we highly recommend using it when learning how to design uis so as usual the resource file for this lesson is in the description if you want to further study the design file yourself and if you have any questions feel free to post in the code group forum and i'll be happy to help again make sure to keep on practicing your design and figma skills because i know i will and it would mean a lot if you would too with those things said i hope you learned something and i'll see you in the next lesson
