00:06 - hey guys welcome to another episode of
00:09 - code with Kris and today we're going to
00:11 - be talking about the Xcode project
00:13 - navigator okay so I just want to remind
00:17 - you guys that the Navigator area is this
00:20 - pinkish section to the left here now let
00:25 - me bring up Xcode and this project is in
00:28 - the link below you can either start your
00:31 - own project or you can download the one
00:33 - in the link and follow along but we're
00:36 - gonna be going over the Navigator area
00:39 - here so you can see this bar with all
00:42 - these icons at the top is the Navigator
00:44 - selector bar there's actually several
00:46 - different you know things you can
00:49 - navigate but we're gonna focus on the
00:51 - first icon which is the project
00:53 - navigator where you're gonna see all the
00:54 - files for your project now in this view
00:57 - you're gonna see four different things
00:58 - you're gonna see projects which is this
01:02 - blue icon right here that indicates a
01:04 - project and you can have multiple Xcode
01:07 - projects in a single Xcode workspace the
01:11 - next thing is groups which are these
01:13 - yellow folder looking icons but I want
01:16 - to make one thing clear is that these
01:18 - are not representative of the actual
01:21 - folders on your filesystem so let me
01:24 - pull up my finder and you can see here
01:27 - that this is the project I'm looking at
01:30 - through Xcode this folder structure is
01:33 - not representative of of these files I
01:36 - can move these files around within my my
01:40 - within my project navigator and it will
01:42 - not affect the actual files sitting on
01:45 - my filesystem now the second thing you
01:48 - can at the third thing you can have are
01:50 - actual folder references and those are
01:54 - indicated by blue icons now that will
01:57 - actually map to something on the file
02:00 - system so let me give you an example of
02:02 - that for example if I dragged this
02:05 - folder from finder over and I said
02:08 - create folder references references
02:11 - instead of group then it's gonna show me
02:15 - that this is a folder reference now
02:18 - there are pros and cons to either doing
02:21 - groups or folder references and I'm
02:24 - gonna go through that in the next video
02:26 - when we talk about adding files to the
02:29 - solution so I'm gonna remove that for
02:32 - now and the last thing you can have in
02:36 - this project Navigator are files so you
02:40 - know these are your files right here so
02:42 - that's it for this video we went over
02:44 - what we can expect to see in the project
02:46 - navigator and Xcode and let me leave you
02:49 - guys with the fun fact did you know that
02:51 - multitasking was only available as of
02:54 - iOS 4 and the question I'm gonna leave
02:57 - you guys off with is did you own the
02:59 - very first generation iPhone and if you
03:02 - did do you remember what it was like
03:03 - before multitasking was available let me
03:06 - know in the comment section below and
03:07 - I'll see you guys next time
03:11 - [Music]
03:20 - you
03:21 - [Music]

hey guys welcome to another episode of code with Kris and today we're going to be talking about the Xcode project navigator okay so I just want to remind you guys that the Navigator area is this pinkish section to the left here now let me bring up Xcode and this project is in the link below you can either start your own project or you can download the one in the link and follow along but we're gonna be going over the Navigator area here so you can see this bar with all these icons at the top is the Navigator selector bar there's actually several different you know things you can navigate but we're gonna focus on the first icon which is the project navigator where you're gonna see all the files for your project now in this view you're gonna see four different things you're gonna see projects which is this blue icon right here that indicates a project and you can have multiple Xcode projects in a single Xcode workspace the next thing is groups which are these yellow folder looking icons but I want to make one thing clear is that these are not representative of the actual folders on your filesystem so let me pull up my finder and you can see here that this is the project I'm looking at through Xcode this folder structure is not representative of of these files I can move these files around within my my within my project navigator and it will not affect the actual files sitting on my filesystem now the second thing you can at the third thing you can have are actual folder references and those are indicated by blue icons now that will actually map to something on the file system so let me give you an example of that for example if I dragged this folder from finder over and I said create folder references references instead of group then it's gonna show me that this is a folder reference now there are pros and cons to either doing groups or folder references and I'm gonna go through that in the next video when we talk about adding files to the solution so I'm gonna remove that for now and the last thing you can have in this project Navigator are files so you know these are your files right here so that's it for this video we went over what we can expect to see in the project navigator and Xcode and let me leave you guys with the fun fact did you know that multitasking was only available as of iOS 4 and the question I'm gonna leave you guys off with is did you own the very first generation iPhone and if you did do you remember what it was like before multitasking was available let me know in the comment section below and I'll see you guys next time you
