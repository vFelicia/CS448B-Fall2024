00:17 - hey hey hey guys what's up let me know
00:20 - first of all if you can see me and if
00:22 - you can hear me in the chat so go ahead
00:26 - and type let me know if you guys can see
00:28 - me and hear me it's gonna get set up
00:31 - make sure that there are no technical
00:33 - difficulties before we get started how's
00:37 - everyone doing nice to see some familiar
00:39 - faces from the Facebook community all
00:46 - right we'll just give a couple of
00:47 - moments for people to stop in why don't
00:50 - you let me know what time it is for you
00:51 - right now because right now it's 1:00
00:54 - p.m. right in the afternoon for me after
00:56 - lunch what time is it for you guys all
01:08 - right well I'm gonna get started because
01:11 - I want to be respectful of your time
01:13 - today it's just me no Adrienne
01:15 - unfortunately he's at a Halloween party
01:17 - for his kids so that's that's okay
01:22 - one a.m. Lim thank you so much for
01:25 - joining but I will try my best to manage
01:29 - the chat as well as teach you guys what
01:33 - I have to talk about on the screen today
01:36 - and as you can see I have now I'm full
01:41 - screen right and I've done it so that I
01:44 - can transition to my desktop like this
01:46 - so when I'm doing long extended periods
01:49 - of talking you guys don't just see me in
01:51 - the little corner there
01:52 - all right so very quickly I'm going to
01:55 - do a recap of what we've done so far
01:56 - with the Pomodoro timer app and then
01:59 - we're gonna take a look at I'm gonna
02:00 - show you how I did the design go through
02:03 - a little bit about how to use sketch and
02:05 - how I did that and then I'm gonna go
02:07 - through a local notifications demo to
02:10 - show you how we can schedule
02:12 - notifications to show up for the user
02:15 - even if the app is off and that's
02:18 - something that we're definitely going to
02:19 - need to do because the Pomodoro timer is
02:22 - gonna run in the background even if the
02:24 - user doesn't have the app
02:25 - and I think all of that is probably
02:27 - gonna take only about half an hour and
02:29 - so whatever questions you guys have
02:31 - afterwards off topic or on topic I'd be
02:34 - happy to stick around and answer them
02:36 - for you
02:36 - that's kind of what we have in store but
02:39 - before I go into the recap I want to
02:40 - know what percentage of you guys well
02:43 - actually the best way to do this problem
02:44 - is probably like comment in the chat if
02:48 - you do not know if you haven't been
02:50 - following the how to make an app from
02:53 - scratch Pomodoro timer app thing because
02:56 - this is the third time that I've gone on
02:59 - livestream to work on this Pomodoro
03:01 - timer app so if you have no idea what's
03:04 - going on in your joining the stream for
03:06 - the first time welcome but please let me
03:08 - know so I know how much of a recap I
03:11 - have to do hey I'm so happy to see you
03:14 - guys Wow all sorts of time zones in here
03:17 - thank you so much for joining I am I'm
03:19 - super honored and super flattered that
03:21 - you guys are stopping by honestly okay
03:27 - well it seems like you guys are caught
03:30 - up so I won't go too much back in terms
03:33 - of a recap but I do want to show you
03:35 - what the design is so first of all in
03:38 - the previous livestream we did something
03:40 - like this just a simple wireframe to
03:42 - show just to show where the elements are
03:47 - gonna go all right and to remind you
03:49 - guys v1 will just be the three timers
03:52 - for Pomodoro Technique the work timer
03:55 - the short break timer and the long timer
03:57 - and then the timer also needs to work in
03:59 - the background so if the user exits the
04:01 - app that the timer's still running and
04:04 - if the timer expires when the user is
04:07 - out of the app we want to show a local
04:09 - notification and that's something that I
04:10 - didn't tell you guys I didn't think
04:12 - about before but then I realized that
04:14 - and I needed to figure out how I was
04:17 - gonna do that part of that local
04:20 - notifications demo though is I'm going
04:22 - to show you from the perspective of me
04:24 - doing it for the first time because I'll
04:28 - be completely honest with you guys
04:29 - and you know no matter if it's me or
04:32 - some other I was guru your following out
04:36 - there no one knows everything even
04:37 - though it seems like
04:39 - I might know what I'm doing when I'm
04:41 - doing a video for you there's a lot of
04:42 - like research and planning and the iOS
04:46 - SDK is so big that no one knows
04:47 - everything and so I think that's a very
04:49 - common misconception for beginners who
04:51 - are starting to learn they feel like
04:53 - these gurus know everything but the
04:56 - reality the honest fact is that you only
05:01 - need to know enough of how to use Xcode
05:05 - kind of Swift code how the app you know
05:09 - view controllers life cycle you need to
05:10 - have like a foundational base knowledge
05:13 - and the rest really is reading in
05:17 - implementing documentation because Apple
05:19 - has great documentation you're gonna be
05:21 - working with api's and libraries which
05:24 - you've never worked with before there's
05:26 - always new services platforms coming out
05:29 - but they're always they always come with
05:31 - documentation and so it's very important
05:33 - that you get used to reading
05:35 - documentation interpreting it trying it
05:39 - out and there's a lot of figuring out
05:41 - and so for this local notifications demo
05:43 - that we're gonna jump into in today's
05:45 - live stream I'm going to show you kind
05:46 - of like how I from not knowing how to do
05:49 - it to having to implement it in the demo
05:53 - so I think that will be an eye-opening
05:55 - experience for you if you're if you are
05:58 - a beginner alright cool so let's go into
06:06 - the design part first of all so we did
06:08 - this timer wireframes just to do a quick
06:12 - recap for those of you guys who missed
06:14 - the last lesson so you know what's going
06:16 - on there's basically a timer in the
06:19 - middle the start button I put near the
06:21 - bottom so that your thumb can reach it
06:23 - and then this ring it basically fills up
06:25 - as the timer nears the end of the timer
06:29 - and you can swipe left and right for the
06:31 - other rings because in the Pomodoro
06:34 - Technique there are three different
06:36 - timers so there's the short break one or
06:38 - you can swipe to the other side this is
06:41 - a wireframe of it running so the play
06:44 - button turns into like a stop and pause
06:46 - button and then when it reaches the end
06:49 - there is a restarting so I want to show
06:52 - you
06:53 - the simple design I came up with it's
06:56 - not like groundbreaking or anything but
06:58 - this is what I imagined kind of like
07:00 - almost like the Apple glowing ring so
07:03 - let me make this a little bit bigger so
07:05 - you guys can see so I want to show you
07:08 - how I created this inside sketch and
07:11 - even if you aren't using sketch of
07:14 - you're using figma I haven't touched the
07:16 - dhobi XD before so I'm not sure how
07:20 - close it is to that but I having worked
07:22 - with figma and sketches they're very
07:24 - very similar but aside from like weird
07:27 - buttons are how to use sketch or for use
07:30 - figma the actual techniques in putting
07:34 - this design together I think will be
07:36 - invaluable nonetheless so so this is the
07:41 - design that I came up with you can see
07:43 - part of the green ring and part of the
07:45 - blue ring here these are the other two
07:47 - timers so you can kind of swipe to the
07:49 - left or swipe to the right to get the
07:50 - other two timers and this background is
07:53 - playing right now but when we implement
07:56 - a couple more features like v2 I want to
08:00 - have some sort of animated moving
08:01 - background if you want like that could
08:03 - be maybe a paid upgrade or it could be
08:06 - you know you can have several options
08:07 - we're also going to have some quotes
08:09 - some inspirational or motivational
08:10 - quotes appear and if you didn't know
08:15 - what this Pomodoro app is all about
08:17 - we're gonna be integrating social
08:19 - features into it and so that's what
08:21 - makes this Pomodoro timer app unique
08:23 - from the other ones out there in the
08:25 - market right now and so I had to figure
08:27 - out like how am I gonna in like I want
08:31 - the interface to be nice and clean but
08:33 - how am I going to integrate like friends
08:35 - lists searching for friends social posts
08:39 - and all that stuff and still keep have
08:42 - this like clean interface for when
08:44 - you're running a timer and you just want
08:46 - to stay focused on what you're working
08:47 - on right and so what I came up with was
08:50 - actually to have this Pomodoro timing
08:54 - screen as something which you can slide
08:56 - up which reveals a bunch of tabs at the
08:59 - bottom so then you can go through these
09:01 - different tabs when you're not running
09:03 - your timer or even if you are running
09:05 - your timer
09:06 - check on like the settings the friends
09:09 - what your friends are doing and stuff
09:12 - like that like all of the other stuff we
09:15 - can use leverage a tab bar the reason
09:18 - why tab bars are so popular these days
09:19 - is because phones are getting longer
09:22 - well at least the Apple iPhones are
09:24 - getting hunger and longer so you can see
09:26 - this is an iPhone X or 10s and it's like
09:31 - very long compared to this is an iPhone
09:35 - 8 or same size that as an iPhone yeah
09:42 - this is an iPhone 8 that I started to
09:44 - design in and to compare this is an
09:47 - iPhone 10 so you can see it's much
09:49 - longer and so you have a lot more
09:51 - vertical real estate so that's why tab
09:55 - bars are so popular these days rather
09:57 - than having like a hamburger menu and
09:59 - having a slide-out menu from the
10:01 - left-hand side I mean you still see
10:03 - those but if you only have like five
10:08 - tabs Mac's using a tab bar is a great
10:11 - option using the slide-out menu you can
10:14 - put a lot more stuff in it so if you do
10:16 - have a lot more stuff you might want to
10:17 - consider that instead so that this is
10:21 - kind of like the simple design I'm going
10:22 - to show you guys how I put this together
10:25 - and I think it will be still very
10:28 - informative for you so I'm gonna use the
10:33 - wireframes here and move this up a
10:35 - little bit maybe I can make this window
10:38 - a little bit bigger for you guys there
10:41 - we go now the one cool thing about
10:43 - sketch is that you can kind of keep all
10:46 - of your documents inside this one sketch
10:48 - document you have this concept called
10:50 - pages so this where we have this page
10:53 - where we have these wireframes I can
10:55 - just name this page with wireframes
10:58 - and then I can create a new page and I
11:01 - couldn't call this like v1 design for
11:07 - example and then it's empty right now
11:09 - I'm gonna start a new artboard a new
11:12 - artboard is kind of like just a frame
11:13 - for your design so choosing something
11:17 - like this
11:18 - now for the background all I did was add
11:21 - a shape you'll have you'll have these
11:23 - shapes in figma as well so I created a
11:25 - rectangle and I use the shortcut key are
11:29 - you could also go insert up here and
11:31 - choose shape you have all these
11:32 - different types of shapes and usually
11:35 - the same thing in figma when you click
11:37 - on an object or an element on the right
11:40 - hand side you can find all of the
11:43 - configurable attributes and properties
11:44 - for it so for example for this guy
11:52 - actually they changed there it is so the
11:56 - recently I upgraded sketch to the latest
11:59 - version and they change the UI a little
12:01 - bit so all of the buttons placements
12:04 - which I'm used to they've kind of moved
12:05 - them around so if you see me fumbling a
12:08 - little bit that's that's kind of why so
12:11 - I'm gonna change this color and you can
12:12 - pick a solid color or pick a gradient so
12:16 - for example I have a couple of preset
12:19 - gradients but for this app I chose
12:21 - something like of a dark blue no I'm not
12:24 - actually married to this so here's the
12:27 - beginning color I really like the rich
12:31 - dark blue I like that
12:41 - let me just check on the chat someone
12:44 - using a super chat sorry oh sorry you
12:55 - guys oh you guys have been not looking
13:03 - at my screen sorry about this let me
13:08 - change this right now alright so it
13:14 - looks like I have not mastered the use
13:18 - of my livestream software so sorry about
13:22 - that you guys right now you should be
13:25 - seeing my screen you should be seeing
13:27 - sketch luckily we haven't gone too far
13:29 - into it yet but this is what I have so
13:33 - far so I apologize to you guys who are
13:35 - watching super super sorry about that
13:43 - alright alright cool cool cool so I'm
13:47 - super sorry about that you guys so
13:50 - basically what I did
13:52 - started with an art board okay and put a
13:56 - shape on it put a gradient on it and now
14:01 - we're going to create the design for it
14:04 - did you guys even see the design then
14:05 - here let me show you guys what I'm
14:07 - setting out to create I don't even know
14:11 - if the screen was on at this time if you
14:13 - guys were able to see this probably not
14:15 - but this is the simple design that I'm
14:17 - showing you how to recreate now so it's
14:20 - got the timer the other two timers on
14:23 - the left and right side it's going to
14:25 - slide up to create a tab bar sorry to
14:28 - show a tab bar with all of the different
14:29 - sections and that's basically it
14:33 - alright so the next thing we're gonna do
14:35 - is put a circular shape so we can go to
14:38 - shape oval and same thing I think into
14:42 - all graphics apps they do this if you
14:43 - hold down the shift button and you click
14:45 - and drag you're going to create a
14:46 - perfect circle but if you don't hold
14:48 - down shift you're going to be able to
14:49 - create ovals so I can create
14:53 - and oval like that I'll put it in the
14:55 - center and I'm gonna get rid of the fill
14:58 - and instead I'm going to use the border
15:00 - so for this width let's put something
15:04 - like 8 and it's arbitrary for me right
15:08 - now I'm gonna change this solid color to
15:10 - a gradient so for this gradient I'll
15:15 - show you something
15:16 - neat so gradients usually go from one
15:20 - color to another color you can also add
15:23 - kind of stops in between those two
15:27 - gradients and you can kind of change
15:28 - them to other colors like this but if
15:36 - you want to show progress like in the
15:39 - beginning when I was first using these
15:41 - graphics programs I could never
15:42 - understand what this angular gradient
15:44 - was used for but now I kind of
15:46 - understand it's to show progress so you
15:48 - know progress bar sometimes they have
15:50 - like a dark color to a light color or a
15:52 - light to a dark color for a circular
15:55 - progress ring like this this would be
15:57 - the perfect opportunity to use this sort
15:59 - of angular gradient so for example I can
16:04 - use and change like a maybe a dark pink
16:11 - to like a light pink so you can play
16:13 - around with that I'm not going to spend
16:14 - too much time fiddling around with this
16:18 - but there's that next we can insert like
16:23 - a piece of text so you can go here there
16:27 - it is so that's my default font it's way
16:33 - too big and I'll use the e the San
16:40 - Francisco font and we can customize the
16:43 - font if we'd like when we actually oops
16:51 - so put that in the middle we'll make it
16:53 - a little bigger you can even choose a
17:04 - variation so we can go light which i
17:06 - think is what I ended up doing or ultra
17:08 - light I'm gonna use display so I can go
17:19 - for the ultra light there and then for
17:25 - the icon I use a service called icons 8
17:31 - which has this desktop app which gives
17:33 - me all these different icons for me I
17:35 - can use in my app it's not a free
17:38 - actually you can use it for free but I
17:40 - think there are certain limitations on
17:42 - the sizes that you get so for what I
17:44 - have right now I have I'm paying I think
17:48 - $99 a year
17:49 - for access to all of their icons at
17:52 - whatever size is that I'd like and I
17:56 - think it's totally worth it because
17:57 - aside from using it for apps I also use
17:59 - it for my thumbnails and websites and
18:01 - stuff like that so I can drag a play
18:04 - icon like that on the screen and then
18:08 - you can actually further customize it so
18:09 - I can change the color because it's an
18:11 - SVG so I can enlarge it a little bit or
18:14 - shrink it or do whatever like that so
18:18 - for the glow for this ring what I ended
18:21 - up doing was you can see here on the
18:25 - left hand side I have the Oval selected
18:27 - and I just duplicated it and I can call
18:31 - this layer the glow and for this one I
18:34 - gave it a blur effect so you can see I
18:38 - can blur it a lot more so it's actually
18:40 - like two rings one the first ring that's
18:43 - sitting on top is the solid ring with
18:45 - the the lines the rigid lines but then
18:49 - the ring behind it I'm setting it to
18:53 - like a blurry version of it so it almost
18:55 - gives off a glow so that's how you're
18:58 - going to achieve that and one thing I
19:00 - will mention now is that
19:01 - you know this is the design but when it
19:04 - comes to implementing this design into
19:07 - your Xcode project you're not going to
19:09 - be turning everything into graphic
19:12 - assets because a lot actually can be
19:16 - accomplished through code just
19:18 - programming so for example these labels
19:22 - right we can set we can use a UI label
19:25 - we can set a custom font to it as you
19:27 - know set the size and even gradients you
19:30 - can you don't need an image so you can
19:32 - do gradients in the code I'm for me
19:36 - personally I have to figure out how I'm
19:38 - going to be drawing the circle of
19:40 - progress rings but I know you can do it
19:41 - so I'm not going to be exporting those
19:44 - as images and the glows again you can do
19:47 - those through code so it's faster and so
19:50 - you want to do as much with code as you
19:54 - can
19:55 - instead of images so the next thing I'm
20:02 - going to do is basically group my two
20:05 - rings together like that and you can do
20:08 - groups in figma as well I'm gonna call
20:10 - this a I'm just going to call this a
20:13 - ring and I'm going to duplicate this
20:16 - ring and then I can drag it to the left
20:18 - and then I can duplicate another ring
20:22 - and I can drag it to the right and let
20:29 - me just check the messages just see
20:31 - nothing's going wrong oh and a kill are
20:34 - you making a wireframe so sorry guys
20:36 - with that technical difficulty in the
20:38 - beginning you guys might have missed it
20:40 - but I did create a set of wireframes for
20:44 - it it is in the same document there we
20:47 - go so this is what we did in the last
20:49 - livestream together so this is now kind
20:54 - of like the design composites off of the
20:55 - wireframes so for this I'll say this
21:01 - oval one I can just pick a different
21:05 - color a different glow color
21:11 - for this ring can do the same thing so
21:18 - I'm just changing the the colors on
21:21 - those guys and that's basically how I
21:25 - created this design it's gonna be very
21:27 - simple for this v1 version I'm just
21:30 - focusing on getting it launched and
21:32 - getting it to be a working Pomodoro
21:35 - timer oh yeah that's basically it using
21:41 - using figma will be pretty much the same
21:44 - thing and it's free so I would use that
21:47 - first personally but I already have a
21:49 - sketch license and I got used to using
21:51 - sketch before figma came out and so
21:53 - that's why I'm using this personally
21:56 - right now so let me save that and that's
21:59 - kind of me the basic design for the app
22:01 - and next up we're going to talk about
22:05 - the local notifications that's it let me
22:11 - just show you what we have done in the
22:14 - previous livestream let me launch this
22:17 - app in the last livestream I've showed
22:20 - you guys how to have a timer run in the
22:24 - background and it's not what you think
22:26 - it's not like you need to set some
22:28 - background tasks and you know have the
22:31 - timer actually running in the background
22:32 - it's actually setting an end date and
22:35 - when you come back into the app it's
22:37 - checking your current date versus the
22:38 - end date and we're doing some
22:40 - calculations to figure out how we should
22:43 - continue that timer or if the timer is
22:45 - actually done so this is what we created
22:47 - in the previous lesson or the previous
22:49 - livestream so it's just the timer like
22:51 - that seven and even if you leave it
22:54 - there you come back it's at 2:00 now
22:57 - right so we didn't program for that and
23:01 - it keeps going down but what I want to
23:04 - show you guys today is if the timer is
23:07 - running like this
23:10 - and I mean if we're in the app and it
23:13 - runs out we can notify the user and play
23:15 - a sound hey your your timer is done your
23:17 - Pomodoro is done so move on to your next
23:20 - task or start another Pomodoro or go to
23:23 - your break
23:23 - but what happens if you know the user
23:26 - launches it and then they leave the app
23:29 - and they go do something else and then
23:30 - the timer runs out right we still want
23:32 - to notify them that the the Pomodoro is
23:37 - up and so what we have to do instead is
23:40 - we have to schedule a local notification
23:45 - to fire it's like a push notification
23:47 - except it's scheduled locally by your
23:50 - app when when the user hits starts the
23:55 - timer we have to schedule that
23:56 - notification so that is what I set out
23:59 - to do and that's what I'm going to show
24:00 - you now I didn't know how to do it to be
24:02 - in with by I knew something like that
24:04 - existed and it could be done so I
24:07 - started off by typing in UI local
24:12 - notification because I knew that this
24:14 - was what the class was called never
24:16 - worked with it but the first result is
24:18 - Apple documentation and so that's great
24:21 - that's what you want but then I noticed
24:23 - that this whole class is actually
24:27 - deprecated which if you're not familiar
24:29 - with the term means that Apple retired
24:32 - that class and they will or may stop
24:36 - supporting this in future releases and
24:39 - this was deprecated I was 10 so that
24:41 - tells you how often I use this right and
24:44 - I didn't even know so the thing is they
24:48 - didn't tell me what class it was
24:49 - replaced with because usually when they
24:53 - deprecated something they roll that
24:55 - functionality into another class or they
24:57 - just changed the name or they created an
24:59 - entirely new class they didn't tell me
25:02 - right here what it was replaced with so
25:05 - I actually had just to go back to the
25:09 - Google results and I noticed that there
25:10 - was a stack overflow and usually that
25:12 - comes with some discussion so this told
25:16 - me this guy told me that it was now
25:18 - rolled into the user notifications
25:20 - framework and so that gave me kind of my
25:22 - next thing to figure out okay it's
25:25 - called user notifications so just grab
25:30 - that you go back to Google
25:33 - type it in and you can see some
25:37 - tutorials at the so that's great
25:41 - or if once you become familiar with
25:43 - reading documentation and interpreting
25:45 - it it's actually faster just to go into
25:49 - the documentation and look at the
25:52 - classes and Apple documentation is
25:54 - pretty good now because not only it
25:56 - usually just be a listing of like
25:58 - methods in that class and maybe the
26:00 - protocols and all that stuff but these
26:02 - days they actually it's pretty in-depth
26:04 - but it's almost like a tutorial so going
26:07 - through this documentation and you go to
26:10 - topics I noticed that there is a
26:13 - tutorial or a little section on asking
26:15 - permission to use notifications and I
26:18 - noticed this myself when you're using
26:19 - apps they always pop up a little window
26:22 - and asks you can I can this app play
26:26 - notifications for you and so this piece
26:30 - of this piece is going to be something
26:33 - that we'll need but I continue to scroll
26:36 - down notification management remote
26:38 - notifications notifications requests and
26:41 - in here scheduling a notification
26:43 - locally from your app this is exactly
26:46 - what I want to do so I go ahead and
26:48 - click this and I read all of this stuff
26:54 - and basically what I did was just to try
26:58 - it things out I copied the sample code
27:00 - that they have right here so that's what
27:02 - I'm going to show you what I'm doing
27:04 - here
27:06 - right so configuring the notification
27:08 - content so I copied all of this right
27:11 - let's say and I just as a test right I
27:15 - just put it in the viewdidload so I want
27:17 - to see if this works
27:19 - configure local notification specify the
27:26 - conditions for delivery so you can
27:28 - either trigger it from a calendar or a
27:30 - time interval or a location so that's
27:34 - kind of cool right I don't know if you
27:36 - use any grocery apps with with loyalty
27:38 - cards but if you do like I have one
27:40 - called Longo's and whenever i'm close to
27:42 - a Longo's i'm driving by it it always
27:45 - gives me a notification
27:47 - pops up my loyalty card and tells me
27:50 - like oh you might be going to long goes
27:52 - right so here's her loyalty card so
27:54 - that's probably what it's doing there
27:55 - which is pretty cool but what we're
27:58 - going to do is use the calendar
28:02 - notification because we have a date and
28:05 - a time which that timer expires right
28:08 - and so we want to we want to trigger it
28:13 - based on that end date I'm just checking
28:15 - the chat really quickly thank thank you
28:20 - Marcus for letting people know that we
28:21 - have a Facebook on community Facebook
28:24 - community so you can go there and ask
28:25 - questions and get help on your iOS
28:27 - journey and lots of helpful people in
28:30 - there all right so the next part is
28:32 - we're going to configure the date now
28:34 - this is to configure a recurring date
28:37 - and I don't necessarily want to do that
28:40 - so this here is creating a date
28:43 - components class all right so I know I
28:45 - need a date component object because
28:49 - that is what gets passed into this UN
28:52 - calendar notification trigger so if you
28:56 - take if if you were following in the
28:58 - last stream you know that what we do is
29:02 - when the user starts the timer so here
29:06 - in this method we schedule a timer based
29:09 - on however minutes it is so 25 minutes
29:12 - and then we set an end date now this end
29:16 - date is just a date object so now in my
29:19 - head I know I need to convert this date
29:22 - object into a date components object so
29:27 - that I can pass that into this UN
29:30 - calendar trigger right and for repeats I
29:33 - would just put false because my timer is
29:35 - not gonna continually repeat so I copy
29:38 - this chunk of code and
29:46 - I just put here and here it starts
29:50 - saying like oh it doesn't know what this
29:52 - class is so what you have to do if
29:54 - you're using this is just import the
29:58 - user notifications framework so that it
30:01 - recognizes all of these classes right
30:04 - all right so it's complaining about date
30:06 - components because I actually don't have
30:08 - any date components right now so we're
30:13 - gonna have to to do change a date into
30:19 - into date components so we'll figure
30:21 - that out in a second
30:23 - but first we're going to continue with
30:25 - the next task
30:27 - so here it's creating a request based on
30:32 - a uu ID and this is going to be the
30:36 - identifier for that scheduled
30:38 - notification so that in the future if
30:39 - you keep track of this UID you can
30:42 - cancel it right you just in case you
30:45 - need to like modify it or cancel it or
30:47 - whatever this UUID string is this
30:51 - identifier is how you're going to get a
30:54 - reference to it and then you also pass
30:57 - in the content which is this guy right
31:00 - here so the meet of the actual
31:02 - notification and then the trigger which
31:05 - contains the date it's supposed to
31:07 - trigger at and whether or not it repeats
31:09 - so that all of that comes together into
31:12 - a notification request and then you pass
31:15 - that request into the user notification
31:18 - center and that's how that all gets
31:21 - scheduled so we're going to copy this
31:25 - chunk of code and we are going to put it
31:30 - down here so let's configure some of
31:33 - this stuff that we need so first of all
31:34 - back here in the trigger repeats is
31:37 - false because we don't want it to repeat
31:39 - date components let's create a variable
31:42 - for date component component so let's
31:44 - say we have an end date first so our end
31:48 - date let's let should we have a property
31:52 - so I'm gonna say end date is equal to
31:54 - the current date and time and we're
31:57 - add I'm gonna add like 10 seconds to it
32:01 - and then in order to come convert it to
32:04 - date components I had to look this up to
32:08 - let me see if I can remember it right
32:09 - now because I kind of don't remember it
32:12 - so let date components equal take
32:22 - components dot yeah I don't remember it
32:28 - so all you need to do is just google it
32:32 - date components to date or sorry it's
32:37 - the other way around
32:38 - date to date components Swift and yeah
32:43 - you can see that this is the post that I
32:45 - saw right here and by scanning the code
32:51 - you can see that all you need to do is
32:55 - this calendar the calendar class I get
32:59 - the current calendar and then use this
33:03 - date components method specify which
33:06 - components you want and then pass in the
33:10 - date that you want to convert to the
33:12 - date components all right so that's what
33:14 - we're going to do calendar dot current
33:18 - date components and we pass in the
33:21 - components that we want as a set and so
33:24 - we'll do a year month day hour minutes
33:35 - and seconds and then the date what you
33:40 - want to pass in is this end date okay so
33:44 - now we have a set of date components
33:47 - from our date object and let's see what
33:50 - this error is complaining about
34:01 - I'm going to force and rap it because
34:05 - why would this not be able to get a
34:07 - current date oh you know what end date
34:12 - is an optional we declared it up as an
34:16 - optional up here I forgotten so that's
34:17 - why we have to unwrap it down here all
34:20 - right so now we have our date components
34:21 - we're gonna pass that into the
34:24 - notification trigger and then we create
34:28 - the request off of the content and the
34:31 - trigger so let's change the content a
34:34 - little bit pomodoro app your Pomodoro is
34:42 - up and then we are going to just
34:47 - schedule it so then I tried this first
34:51 - and I'm gonna save you from the trouble
34:52 - I tried this first and it wasn't working
34:54 - and that's when I remembered going back
34:57 - here to the documentation that I needed
35:00 - to ask the user permission first to show
35:03 - them notifications and so I click this
35:06 - and this is what we're after we want to
35:10 - show this little pop-up to allow the
35:13 - user to choose yes or no request author
35:16 - a ssin at launch time so I just
35:20 - basically copied this piece of code and
35:23 - I put it here and then I was able to pop
35:29 - up that little window to let the user
35:31 - say allow or disallow I'm gonna move
35:35 - this piece of code to schedule the
35:39 - notification I'm going to move it to
35:40 - actually when the user hits start on the
35:43 - timer because it shouldn't actually run
35:47 - until here so when the user starts the
35:52 - timer that's when we're going to
35:53 - configure the notification we we don't
35:57 - have to set an end date because it was
35:59 - set up here and then we get the date
36:01 - component so we create the trigger we
36:04 - create the request and then we schedule
36:06 - it so let's try it if it were
36:09 - so here my main point is just to show
36:12 - you guys kind of like how to read
36:14 - documentation and like even for someone
36:17 - like me who has been working with Swift
36:20 - and building apps and stuff you know I
36:22 - don't know everything and that this is
36:24 - how easy it is to find out how to do
36:26 - something so again all you need is that
36:28 - kind of base foundation for Xcode and
36:33 - Swift and to understand how iOS works
36:35 - and everything else you can you can
36:38 - research and you can figure out there's
36:39 - no way you'll be able to explore all of
36:42 - the iOS SDK and don't feel like you need
36:45 - to memorize and know everything because
36:47 - you really don't so I'm gonna click
36:49 - allow' here and I'm gonna click start
36:53 - and I'm going to exit the app and then
36:56 - it will wait maybe five more seconds and
36:58 - we should see that notification pop up
37:00 - there see there it goes so that's pretty
37:05 - cool right let me check the chat really
37:08 - quickly hey Adrienne nice to see you man
37:14 - glad you can join how was the Halloween
37:16 - party Adrienne's kids are the cutest so
37:21 - my kids actually had a Halloween party
37:23 - too at school but I didn't have to go so
37:26 - this is how you know my point again is
37:29 - to show you guys how easy it is to read
37:31 - documentation and kind of give you a
37:32 - demo of that this is still demo code
37:35 - like this is not how the real live app
37:38 - is going to be but if you guys have been
37:43 - following on this Pomodoro timer app I'm
37:44 - treating this app seriously so it's not
37:46 - just a demo for you guys or for the
37:49 - channel I'm actually publishing this I'm
37:52 - going to create a website behind it I'm
37:55 - going to promote it put a marketing plan
37:58 - together for this app and we're gonna
38:01 - try to get a user base on it and try to
38:04 - hopefully in the future monetize it a
38:07 - little bit and you know I'm glad you
38:09 - guys are here on the ground so you can
38:14 - see kind of like how this all started
38:17 - so I have really high hopes for this app
38:19 - now I will be creating
38:22 - like the basic v1 version that you see
38:24 - here as a tutorial series on my channel
38:28 - alright so I am leveraging it as a
38:31 - tutorial series as well but personally I
38:35 - am also like I'm also personally
38:38 - invested in seeing this app succeed so
38:40 - that's kind of what I want to do oh and
38:42 - actually this design looks a little bit
38:44 - different from this one I forgot to put
38:46 - that sort of semi-transparent circle
38:51 - right there but that's all I did was for
38:55 - the for the ring right here for the oval
39:00 - um instead of specifying no fill I did
39:04 - give it a fill so I just chose something
39:07 - like that whatever color it was and then
39:10 - I set the opacity to like
39:12 - semi-transparent that's what I did there
39:18 - alright so that's all of the content I
39:20 - had for you guys today
39:21 - that's all I wanted to show you guys
39:23 - today I'm gonna jump into the chat now
39:26 - see if you guys have any questions or if
39:27 - you do type them in the chat right now
39:29 - I'm gonna answer your questions
39:40 - Joan for if you don't have a Mac but you
39:43 - have an iPad you can start learning so
39:45 - on the iPad Apple has a playgrounds app
39:47 - it's really really good oh you know what
39:50 - let me transition to this part yeah so
39:53 - that playgrounds app for iPad is really
39:56 - really good it teaches you how to use
39:59 - Xcode how do you Swift mostly though so
40:03 - you can start learning but eventually
40:04 - you will need a Mac to develop if you
40:07 - want to use like the official Apple
40:08 - tools and you want to develop natively
40:11 - for the iOS you will need a Mac and
40:14 - there are several options you could buy
40:15 - a used Mac even a Mac Mini will do you
40:19 - can use a remote service like Mac and
40:22 - cloud or Mac Stadium or something that
40:24 - allows you to remotely log into a Mac
40:26 - with a PC like a Windows desktop and
40:29 - then you can use it through that or you
40:31 - can you can virtualize it on your PC but
40:34 - we're starting to get a little technical
40:35 - if you're not we actually have an
40:37 - article on our website you can just
40:40 - maybe you can reach out and I can send
40:43 - you the link to that but gives you
40:44 - several options for PC users to create
40:47 - iOS apps Shane do you do this as a
40:52 - career
40:52 - coating Shane yeah so I started off as a
40:56 - software consultant building apps for
40:58 - other clients and I was part of a
41:01 - company I was basically an employee and
41:04 - then I discovered my passion for
41:07 - teaching and there was an audience a lot
41:09 - of you guys out there want to learn how
41:11 - to make apps and so I honestly found a
41:15 - lot more fulfilling than building apps
41:17 - for clients and so I think in the
41:20 - process of a year now this has become my
41:22 - full-time job and I'm basically my
41:27 - income comes from you guys supporting
41:29 - code with Chris through the courses and
41:31 - through YouTube so thank you so much
41:33 - because I wouldn't be here without you
41:34 - guys let's see
41:41 - yeah fellow Roxy put your chat next to
41:44 - your working monitor so he can see both
41:45 - so I was thinking of of doing a dual
41:50 - monitor setup so I can put the chat
41:52 - right now I have my laptop which is I'm
41:55 - seeing myself live-streaming as well or
41:58 - you can get kind of fancy and you can
42:00 - have sort of frame and have your chat
42:03 - but as you can see you guys were
42:05 - watching my face when I thought you guys
42:06 - could see the screen so I need to figure
42:08 - that software out first but I think I'm
42:12 - gonna go dual monitor
42:27 - all right
42:30 - so Iona's asking can you connect this
42:33 - design and Xcode yeah you can so there
42:38 - is actually you can either so there are
42:40 - a couple of different options so the
42:42 - first option is you need to try to
42:45 - replicate as much as possible through
42:46 - code rather than relying on exporting
42:48 - image graphics and then putting it into
42:50 - Xcode barring that your next step is to
42:54 - take what elements that cannot be
42:57 - created programmatically and you can use
42:59 - images right to style your style your
43:03 - elements
43:03 - another cool thing which I showed in I
43:07 - think my very first lesson is figma
43:11 - actually if you select an element in
43:13 - figma it tells you the swift code to
43:18 - generate that element and I don't know
43:22 - how perfect it is because I haven't used
43:24 - it extensively but I just wanted to let
43:28 - you know that it's there and there's
43:30 - also something else which I talked to my
43:35 - coworker my ex co-workers who are still
43:37 - working at the consultant company and
43:39 - they tell me that they use something
43:40 - called Zeppelin now which kind of
43:42 - bridges the gap between the development
43:44 - team and the design team oh you guys
43:47 - can't see my screen again I'm sorry you
43:49 - see this live streaming thing thanks so
43:51 - much for bearing with me so Zeppelin
43:53 - this thing is supposed to bridge the gap
43:56 - between development teams and designer
43:59 - teams and I have never used it before
44:02 - I'm interested in taking a look at what
44:05 - kind of like how to use it but what my
44:08 - guess is that so like selecting a
44:13 - element gives you the code yeah it looks
44:19 - like it gives you the code for it and
44:22 - the cool thing is that you can upload
44:24 - your sketch designs and your figma
44:26 - designs straight into Zeppelin and then
44:30 - it looks like developers and designers
44:33 - can also comment on the design yeah so
44:38 - it's worth it's worth exploring I think
44:40 - so this is a
44:42 - another way which you can use sorry
44:46 - another tool to use to implement your
44:48 - design into Xcode but I think the main
44:51 - thing is to basically use use code to
44:57 - style your elements and then whatever
44:58 - else you can't style to use images Glenn
45:08 - v2 is actually a lot a ton of features
45:11 - so let me show you what that is so this
45:14 - basic Pomodoro app is just like v1 is
45:17 - just the timers right but we have all of
45:20 - these features that I have planned for
45:23 - this app to make it the app that I think
45:26 - is missing out there in the marketplace
45:28 - today and that is the ability to add
45:35 - friends and challenge each other
45:37 - motivate each other to basically
45:40 - complete Pomodoro's so for the
45:43 - productivity focused people it adds a
45:46 - social element to it because I think
45:48 - traditionally this Pomodoro Technique is
45:51 - a very individual thing you want
45:53 - yourself to be focused and complete work
45:57 - and stuff but I got this idea from
45:59 - someone else where they challenge each
46:03 - like there were two friends both using
46:05 - the Pomodoro Technique and they would
46:06 - share how many Pomodoro's they could
46:08 - finish that day and it would motivate
46:11 - them they've motivate each other to do
46:14 - more and to be more productive and to
46:16 - stay focused and so that I'm just
46:19 - translating that into an app which
46:21 - doesn't exist right now all of the apps
46:23 - out there in the marketplace their
46:25 - Pomodoro timers with built in maybe
46:28 - to-do lists or like habit trackers or
46:32 - stuff like that but no social elements
46:34 - to it so that's the idea behind this
46:35 - whole project a v1 is just a simple
46:38 - bare-bones Pomodoro timer which most
46:42 - people which is even below what's out
46:44 - there today so I don't see why people
46:46 - would use my v1 versus a more
46:48 - full-featured app but I need to get it
46:51 - out there to motivate myself to keep
46:53 - going because I know that if I
46:55 - then too much time on a project without
46:58 - without getting some feedback and
47:01 - sending it out there and seeing some
47:02 - progress then I lose motivation and I'm
47:05 - not gonna get to all of this other cool
47:07 - stuff that's planned for the app so I
47:09 - need to get v1 out there in the App
47:11 - Store even if no one's gonna use it but
47:13 - once we get like v2 or v3 and we start
47:15 - getting people's feedback and we start
47:17 - implementing some of these features
47:18 - which don't exist out there right now
47:21 - that's when I see the app gaining some
47:25 - more traction so that's kind of the plan
47:27 - right there yeah karo so Doby XD i think
47:34 - is even if you don't have Creative Cloud
47:36 - now I don't know if you know this but
47:38 - Adobe XD is free actually they made it
47:41 - free maybe to try to get more adoption
47:44 - for the program so I've heard some good
47:49 - things about it if you searched up Adobe
47:51 - XD on YouTube there will be some
47:53 - tutorials for it I've seen that
47:56 - unfortunately I don't know how similar
47:59 - it is to sketch but if I had to guess I
48:03 - would say it's pretty similar yeah so
48:07 - Glen exactly yeah XD is free Iona so a
48:13 - lot of this design that you see here on
48:16 - the screen I think I can do through code
48:19 - so once I start once I get to that point
48:22 - where I'm implementing the design in
48:23 - code like for sure this this gradient
48:26 - background I can do through code the
48:29 - custom label I can do through code like
48:31 - these gradients I can do through
48:34 - semi-transparency I can do through code
48:35 - the glow I can do through code the
48:37 - progress ring filling up I can do
48:40 - through code so like I think pretty much
48:42 - I can do most of it through code this
48:46 - button the simple shape you might even
48:49 - be able to do through code yeah at this
48:54 - point right now for this kind of like
48:56 - simple design I think a lot of this can
48:58 - be done via code once we get into like
49:01 - moving backgrounds and all that stuff
49:03 - maybe then it won't be as much
49:12 - any more questions guys
49:36 - fergan asks can we create this app using
49:39 - react native or any other cross-platform
49:41 - tool let me just change this back so my
49:46 - answer to you is probably yes to be
49:48 - honest I haven't used react native so I
49:53 - can't tell you definitely yes or no but
49:55 - this app is pretty simple I don't see
49:57 - why you wouldn't be able to to do that
50:01 - it's just a different discipline it's
50:03 - like a different set of tools right it's
50:05 - a different language yeah like I don't
50:09 - see why not
50:13 - and if your follow-up question is like
50:16 - why when I use react native to to create
50:20 - this and the only reason for that is
50:24 - because what kind of like what I've
50:29 - learned in the past and what got me to
50:32 - this point was just objective-c Swift
50:35 - and Xcode and stuff so that's what I
50:38 - know and that's what kind of like my
50:40 - comfort zone I guess you would say so
50:42 - that's why I'm building this for iOS
50:45 - using Xcode and Swift but if you were
50:48 - just getting into mobile app development
50:49 - I don't see why you want to explore
50:51 - react native first and it's something
50:53 - that I've wanted to look into myself
50:55 - it's just time is always a constraint
50:57 - right but that's that's my reasoning
51:07 - Glenn will the code be on github it will
51:10 - be it will be available to the public I
51:13 - don't know if it will be github or any
51:14 - other format but yes the code will be
51:16 - available maybe not the full feature set
51:18 - right because at some point if I'm going
51:21 - to be you know turning this trying to
51:24 - turn this into a viable business and
51:27 - trying to make some money off of it at
51:29 - that point doesn't make sense for me to
51:31 - just put the whole source code for the
51:33 - entire app out there right so I think I
51:35 - will be like I'll show you guys how to
51:38 - build this v1 for sure and v2 maybe with
51:41 - some social features and all that stuff
51:42 - but I have to cut it off at some point
51:46 - in terms of the
51:48 - the key code base but I will continue to
51:51 - share with you guys my learnings and the
51:55 - progress of how the app is doing in the
51:58 - App Store how I'm planning features kind
52:02 - of the setbacks that I'm going to
52:03 - experience with it all that stuff right
52:06 - I'm gonna be transparent about that Carl
52:14 - what assets can you import from sketch
52:17 - into Xcode so in sketch mainly you'll be
52:20 - exporting these elements so you're gonna
52:22 - have to see right in sketching and figma
52:26 - I'm not sure about Dobey XD but there's
52:28 - going to be some way for you to export
52:30 - some of these elements out as graphics
52:34 - or as PDF or something like that so you
52:36 - can see you can't see the screen sorry
52:39 - right here I've got the circle selected
52:42 - and in sketch you can choose a image
52:47 - format to export it in so PNG JPEG PDF
52:50 - or whatever and the sizes and you would
52:53 - basically export them and import them
52:56 - into the asset library of Xcode and then
52:59 - you'll be able to select those images
53:01 - when let's say you're styling an image
53:03 - view or a button or something like that
53:05 - you'll have access to those assets in
53:07 - the asset library the danger is to try
53:12 - to make everything in image asset and
53:14 - just do it that way it's gonna work for
53:19 - you but it's just not as optimized for
53:23 - performance as it could be so maybe as a
53:25 - beginner if you know you trying to get
53:28 - it out the door and try to get it done I
53:29 - wouldn't necessarily say it's a bad
53:32 - thing
53:32 - because I know for beginners from my
53:35 - experience teaching people the most
53:37 - important thing is not like how perfect
53:40 - your code is how you know what's the
53:43 - right way what's the wrong way and
53:44 - getting caught up with all of that it
53:47 - really is it's it's a mentality it's a
53:50 - motivation it's it's a it's it's a
53:54 - mental game really too because a lot so
53:56 - many people give up right and so I want
54:01 - to see as many people succeed as
54:02 - well so I always say there is a better
54:06 - way but I'm not gonna say that's the
54:10 - only way right so as a beginner I would
54:12 - put more importance on gaining more
54:16 - experience building more apps making
54:19 - more mistakes kind of you know getting
54:23 - those notches on your belt is more
54:25 - important than trying to write like the
54:28 - perfect code trying to design the
54:30 - perfect app trying to do everything the
54:31 - right way because you can get so caught
54:34 - up in that that it gets discouraging to
54:36 - be honest honestly as a as a beginner
54:39 - you're just gonna feel like wow this is
54:41 - so tedious this is so hard so convoluted
54:44 - to try to make this you know super
54:47 - optimized and you're not gonna have fun
54:50 - you have to be having fun with it if
54:52 - you're gonna stick with it and then when
54:54 - you get like really serious about it and
54:55 - you're gonna start applying for jobs and
54:57 - I don't know start building like a big
55:00 - apps trying to make money or whatever
55:02 - then you can start learning about how to
55:05 - optimize your code for performance and
55:07 - how to do things like follow best
55:09 - practices and stuff and it's not too
55:11 - late you know it's not too late it's not
55:13 - like golf
55:13 - I feel like when I was learning golf it
55:16 - was imperative that you kind of trained
55:19 - your muscles and your movements right
55:21 - from the beginning so you don't kind of
55:24 - develop these bad habits are become
55:26 - really hard to correct but for coding
55:29 - you can develop bad habits but it's not
55:32 - like you cannot correct it because it's
55:33 - not muscle memory right you just have to
55:35 - remember oh I should be doing it this
55:37 - way I shouldn't be doing it that way all
55:40 - right let's check out what other
55:41 - questions you guys have
55:47 - I own a so why do this with another tool
55:50 - if it can be implemented directly
55:51 - through code so that's an individual
55:54 - developer yeah you're free to just start
55:57 - like just implementing a design in Xcode
56:01 - but if you're following kind of like a
56:04 - traditional app development process and
56:09 - maybe this just applies because I was
56:11 - working with clients right you have to
56:13 - show them what they're gonna get before
56:15 - you go and work on it and so the doing
56:18 - the wireframes right showed them where
56:21 - all of the elements was going to be how
56:23 - how the user would interact with the
56:24 - screens and how many screens there were
56:26 - where the pop-ups were and all of that
56:28 - stuff and they would basically sign off
56:30 - on that and say yes this looks good to
56:31 - us before we proceeded to this step
56:34 - which is styling everything in and
56:36 - adding color and emotion to the app
56:40 - showing how some of the animations might
56:43 - work and then they sign off on that and
56:44 - then then you start developing it so I
56:51 - guess maybe in a way it was to protect
56:54 - the company right but as an individual
57:00 - developer I feel like it's still a good
57:03 - idea to do this because it gives you
57:07 - like a roadmap for when you when you go
57:09 - down the development path because if
57:11 - you're trying to design things as you're
57:13 - developing it you there will be a lot of
57:16 - back-and-forth like a lot of
57:18 - backtracking and that can lead to a lot
57:23 - of code like bloat and you might leave
57:27 - pieces of code that you don't use
57:30 - anymore in your project so it's almost
57:32 - like having this doing it this doing
57:35 - these graphic comps in a graphics
57:38 - program gives you a roadmap to do your
57:43 - development
57:50 - aidan so thank you thank you about the
57:53 - compliment for the design I really
57:54 - wanted to make it minimal so you can
57:55 - focus like it's clean so it's not
57:58 - cluttered so you can focus on your work
58:00 - yes the background is gonna run in the
58:02 - background it's what we did in the
58:05 - previous livestream so you'll find out
58:06 - on my channel in part 2 I showed you
58:08 - guys how to keep a timer or how we're
58:12 - going to keep the time even if the user
58:14 - is out of the app and in this livestream
58:17 - I showed you guys how to notify that the
58:20 - timer is up even if the user is not in
58:23 - the app so yeah Timothy unfortunately I
58:28 - don't know too much about vapor but I
58:31 - know there are a lot of tutorials good a
58:33 - good tutorials out there yeah Glen so
58:39 - you meant v1 before yeah the v1 code it
58:41 - will be out there I don't know if it
58:43 - will be on you guys should start using
58:46 - github traditionally I just like zipped
58:48 - it up and sent it to people but what do
58:53 - you use for icon creation for the
58:55 - various sizes Glen I actually have a
58:57 - video on that in my channel so just go
58:59 - over to my channel page click on the
59:02 - videos and then it's maybe like four or
59:05 - five videos down it was pretty recent so
59:08 - you can check that out any more
59:15 - questions you guys I've got a couple
59:19 - more minutes left so again I want to
59:21 - thank you guys all for joining and
59:25 - helping me feel so comfortable on the
59:28 - live stream just hanging out with you
59:29 - guys so actually let me know I want to
59:31 - give you guys a question so in these
59:33 - live streams you guys are seeing me like
59:35 - build build stuff to show you guys code
59:38 - and all that stuff but I'm also thinking
59:40 - about having a like jam session you know
59:44 - how our name is code with Chris and so
59:47 - this live stream will basically be me
59:50 - like us just coding together so I'm
59:53 - coding my thing you can see my screen
59:55 - I'll have headphones on and I'll be
59:57 - coding we can have a chat going and
60:00 - you can code you can learn or code your
60:02 - own thing right well it's basically just
60:05 - the jam session a code jam session where
60:07 - as if we were all working like at a
60:11 - table and I won't really be focusing on
60:13 - teaching rather I'll be focusing on
60:15 - building stuff like maybe building demos
60:19 - for future tutorials or building apps
60:20 - that I would like to build just me or me
60:23 - learning through different tutorials
60:25 - because I'm constantly learning as well
60:26 - but just like hanging out chatting
60:28 - casual so I can do a lot more of those
60:33 - because I don't have to prepare anything
60:34 - for it so let me know if you is that's
60:37 - something that you would want to join
60:41 - and just you know you know when it's
60:43 - gonna be each week and it's just a time
60:46 - which you were gonna set aside so that
60:48 - you can learn some coding or do some
60:50 - coding and we can do it do that together
60:52 - let me know
61:09 - Glenn I missed your question what is
61:12 - your view on splash screens with an app
61:15 - so my my view I actually subscribe to
61:19 - the Apple view of what to do with splash
61:22 - screens which is or otherwise no one has
61:24 - launched screens and if you go into
61:27 - their human interface guidelines they
61:29 - have some guidance on what to do with
61:30 - launch screens and that is not to show
61:33 - your logo not to show like loading bars
61:37 - or whatever I know games are notorious
61:38 - for doing this sort of stuff but for in
61:41 - terms of apps their guidance is
61:43 - basically to show your home screen like
61:47 - a bear version of your home screen so
61:50 - that it gives the illusion that when
61:53 - people tap on your app icon your app
61:56 - launches really really fast because that
61:59 - launch screen if it looks like your home
62:00 - screen and then it transitions into your
62:03 - actual home screen with the data coming
62:05 - in it feels like your app was like
62:09 - really quick and speedy and I think when
62:11 - apps launch really slow people tend to
62:13 - not want to use them as much so that's
62:16 - the guidance that Apple gives and that's
62:18 - what I think like I agree with that
62:30 - alright thanks for giving me some
62:32 - validation on my coach ahem idea so you
62:36 - guys can actually be coding with Chris
62:38 - and I know for a lot of people they
62:40 - can't find time you know they want to
62:41 - learn how to code they want to learn
62:43 - Swift and Xcode but they just can't find
62:46 - time in their schedule to do it but for
62:49 - for a lot of people it's it's an issue
62:53 - of prioritizing it I think if if it's
62:55 - something that's high on your priority
62:56 - list to do then you're gonna make some
62:58 - time and prioritize it and so that's
63:02 - what my code Jam idea is is kind of
63:07 - revolving around the helping people have
63:11 - a time in their calendar they can set it
63:14 - there that during for that one hour
63:16 - they're gonna be sitting down with me
63:18 - and we're gonna be coding together I'm
63:20 - gonna be doing my thing you're gonna be
63:21 - even your thing and we can chat through
63:23 - chat if something you know if you is
63:25 - basically having some coding buddies do
63:34 - you think it's possible to make an app
63:35 - successful coding it only for Apple OS
63:38 - and Android I think those are the two
63:41 - major platforms but my point of view is
63:45 - that the app is the app but really what
63:48 - is gonna make your app successful is
63:49 - really the business plan and the
63:51 - marketing plan behind the app because I
63:55 - think it's pretty hard to like protect
63:59 - your app idea like once your app
64:01 - launches and it it's like one of a kind
64:04 - you're the first one there unique idea
64:07 - there's gonna be clones there's gonna be
64:09 - people who are who will create other
64:11 - versions of it so you know you you need
64:15 - to leverage that first mover advantage
64:17 - and have a solid business plan and
64:20 - marketing plan so that you you take that
64:24 - lead and turn it so so big that other
64:27 - competitors can't catch up with you
64:35 - is it difficult yeah exactly like floppy
64:37 - word is it difficult to write code out
64:39 - of your own mind or is this normal for a
64:42 - beginner yeah it's completely normal so
64:46 - if you ask me this is what the
64:49 - progression should be so as a beginner
64:51 - you should start doing so I have a I
64:56 - have a 28 day coding plan for beginners
64:59 - and I have that on my channel so you can
65:02 - actually follow those videos and that is
65:04 - the exact order of lessons of concepts
65:07 - taught and lessons to learn that I take
65:10 - all of my paying students through
65:12 - alright so after you get to that point
65:14 - you get that foundational layer I was
65:16 - talking about this the whole live stream
65:18 - after you have that base foundational
65:20 - knowledge you're not gonna know every
65:21 - single thing under the iOS SDK you're
65:24 - not gonna know how to do anything but no
65:25 - one knows how to do everything right
65:27 - there's the beauty of it once you have
65:29 - that foundational knowledge the next
65:31 - step is to build as many of these like
65:34 - demo type of apps as possible and you
65:38 - know there's a lot of content creators
65:40 - out there issuing tutorials on how to
65:42 - build different apps try to consume as
65:44 - many of it as possible because you're
65:45 - gonna get exposed to different
65:47 - architectures new new classes new how to
65:51 - do different features and stuff like
65:53 - that and you're gonna take all of that
65:57 - experience and when it comes time to
66:00 - build your own app you're coming up with
66:02 - something from scratch you you're gonna
66:05 - remember all of those demo apps that
66:07 - you've built and you're gonna be able to
66:09 - think in your head hey I did something
66:11 - similar to what I want to do now back
66:16 - then so let me pull that up take a look
66:18 - at it and you can you can adapt it and
66:22 - you can you know grow from there or
66:26 - stand on the shoulders of giants if you
66:28 - have no pool of experience to draw from
66:31 - it's really really hard for you to come
66:33 - up with something out of thin air right
66:36 - so just to reiterate have a plan like a
66:42 - lesson plan if you're starting out from
66:44 - scratch so that you at least get
66:47 - the foundation stuff in and then build
66:50 - as many like small demos as you can to
66:52 - get more to build up a pool of
66:54 - experience and then you can go and
66:57 - tackle your own app and because at that
67:01 - point you have this whole pool of
67:03 - experience to draw from
67:17 - all right so we're a little short on
67:21 - time um where can I find lessons to make
67:24 - a social media app phantom I would
67:28 - challenge you to define social media app
67:30 - a little bit more because a lot of
67:34 - people say they want to make social
67:35 - media apps and I have no idea what that
67:36 - means like you want to create the next
67:38 - Facebook or what but social media apps
67:41 - like if you're talking about a social
67:43 - network you want to create an app like a
67:46 - whole social network your own social
67:47 - network you need to start from the
67:49 - fundamental stuff and you can find that
67:50 - if you go on my channel page and just
67:52 - hit the things called like how to make
67:55 - how to make apps beginner series or
67:58 - something like that so check that out
68:00 - it's the war card game tutorial there's
68:01 - actually a couple more modules after
68:03 - that which is also available in my
68:05 - channel so go through all of that get
68:07 - that base foundational knowledge in and
68:09 - there are some free tutorials out there
68:11 - to implement social features for apps
68:13 - and at that point you'll be ready to
68:15 - tackle that but at this point what I
68:19 - would have challenge you to do is just
68:21 - define define what a social media app
68:25 - means to you very very well so you kind
68:27 - of know what what you set out to do the
68:30 - more vague your idea is the more likely
68:33 - it is to fail because you don't know
68:35 - what you don't know what you want right
68:37 - but if you can define exactly what you
68:39 - want down to like the screens and stuff
68:41 - like that you kind of have a plan
68:44 - so anyways happy Halloween guys I'm so
68:47 - happy to see all of you here same time
68:51 - next week and we'll do another
68:53 - livestream and at that point I think I
68:55 - will actually have most of this app done
68:58 - and I'm gonna release them as videos and

Cleaned transcript:

hey hey hey guys what's up let me know first of all if you can see me and if you can hear me in the chat so go ahead and type let me know if you guys can see me and hear me it's gonna get set up make sure that there are no technical difficulties before we get started how's everyone doing nice to see some familiar faces from the Facebook community all right we'll just give a couple of moments for people to stop in why don't you let me know what time it is for you right now because right now it's 100 p.m. right in the afternoon for me after lunch what time is it for you guys all right well I'm gonna get started because I want to be respectful of your time today it's just me no Adrienne unfortunately he's at a Halloween party for his kids so that's that's okay one a.m. Lim thank you so much for joining but I will try my best to manage the chat as well as teach you guys what I have to talk about on the screen today and as you can see I have now I'm full screen right and I've done it so that I can transition to my desktop like this so when I'm doing long extended periods of talking you guys don't just see me in the little corner there all right so very quickly I'm going to do a recap of what we've done so far with the Pomodoro timer app and then we're gonna take a look at I'm gonna show you how I did the design go through a little bit about how to use sketch and how I did that and then I'm gonna go through a local notifications demo to show you how we can schedule notifications to show up for the user even if the app is off and that's something that we're definitely going to need to do because the Pomodoro timer is gonna run in the background even if the user doesn't have the app and I think all of that is probably gonna take only about half an hour and so whatever questions you guys have afterwards off topic or on topic I'd be happy to stick around and answer them for you that's kind of what we have in store but before I go into the recap I want to know what percentage of you guys well actually the best way to do this problem is probably like comment in the chat if you do not know if you haven't been following the how to make an app from scratch Pomodoro timer app thing because this is the third time that I've gone on livestream to work on this Pomodoro timer app so if you have no idea what's going on in your joining the stream for the first time welcome but please let me know so I know how much of a recap I have to do hey I'm so happy to see you guys Wow all sorts of time zones in here thank you so much for joining I am I'm super honored and super flattered that you guys are stopping by honestly okay well it seems like you guys are caught up so I won't go too much back in terms of a recap but I do want to show you what the design is so first of all in the previous livestream we did something like this just a simple wireframe to show just to show where the elements are gonna go all right and to remind you guys v1 will just be the three timers for Pomodoro Technique the work timer the short break timer and the long timer and then the timer also needs to work in the background so if the user exits the app that the timer's still running and if the timer expires when the user is out of the app we want to show a local notification and that's something that I didn't tell you guys I didn't think about before but then I realized that and I needed to figure out how I was gonna do that part of that local notifications demo though is I'm going to show you from the perspective of me doing it for the first time because I'll be completely honest with you guys and you know no matter if it's me or some other I was guru your following out there no one knows everything even though it seems like I might know what I'm doing when I'm doing a video for you there's a lot of like research and planning and the iOS SDK is so big that no one knows everything and so I think that's a very common misconception for beginners who are starting to learn they feel like these gurus know everything but the reality the honest fact is that you only need to know enough of how to use Xcode kind of Swift code how the app you know view controllers life cycle you need to have like a foundational base knowledge and the rest really is reading in implementing documentation because Apple has great documentation you're gonna be working with api's and libraries which you've never worked with before there's always new services platforms coming out but they're always they always come with documentation and so it's very important that you get used to reading documentation interpreting it trying it out and there's a lot of figuring out and so for this local notifications demo that we're gonna jump into in today's live stream I'm going to show you kind of like how I from not knowing how to do it to having to implement it in the demo so I think that will be an eyeopening experience for you if you're if you are a beginner alright cool so let's go into the design part first of all so we did this timer wireframes just to do a quick recap for those of you guys who missed the last lesson so you know what's going on there's basically a timer in the middle the start button I put near the bottom so that your thumb can reach it and then this ring it basically fills up as the timer nears the end of the timer and you can swipe left and right for the other rings because in the Pomodoro Technique there are three different timers so there's the short break one or you can swipe to the other side this is a wireframe of it running so the play button turns into like a stop and pause button and then when it reaches the end there is a restarting so I want to show you the simple design I came up with it's not like groundbreaking or anything but this is what I imagined kind of like almost like the Apple glowing ring so let me make this a little bit bigger so you guys can see so I want to show you how I created this inside sketch and even if you aren't using sketch of you're using figma I haven't touched the dhobi XD before so I'm not sure how close it is to that but I having worked with figma and sketches they're very very similar but aside from like weird buttons are how to use sketch or for use figma the actual techniques in putting this design together I think will be invaluable nonetheless so so this is the design that I came up with you can see part of the green ring and part of the blue ring here these are the other two timers so you can kind of swipe to the left or swipe to the right to get the other two timers and this background is playing right now but when we implement a couple more features like v2 I want to have some sort of animated moving background if you want like that could be maybe a paid upgrade or it could be you know you can have several options we're also going to have some quotes some inspirational or motivational quotes appear and if you didn't know what this Pomodoro app is all about we're gonna be integrating social features into it and so that's what makes this Pomodoro timer app unique from the other ones out there in the market right now and so I had to figure out like how am I gonna in like I want the interface to be nice and clean but how am I going to integrate like friends lists searching for friends social posts and all that stuff and still keep have this like clean interface for when you're running a timer and you just want to stay focused on what you're working on right and so what I came up with was actually to have this Pomodoro timing screen as something which you can slide up which reveals a bunch of tabs at the bottom so then you can go through these different tabs when you're not running your timer or even if you are running your timer check on like the settings the friends what your friends are doing and stuff like that like all of the other stuff we can use leverage a tab bar the reason why tab bars are so popular these days is because phones are getting longer well at least the Apple iPhones are getting hunger and longer so you can see this is an iPhone X or 10s and it's like very long compared to this is an iPhone 8 or same size that as an iPhone yeah this is an iPhone 8 that I started to design in and to compare this is an iPhone 10 so you can see it's much longer and so you have a lot more vertical real estate so that's why tab bars are so popular these days rather than having like a hamburger menu and having a slideout menu from the lefthand side I mean you still see those but if you only have like five tabs Mac's using a tab bar is a great option using the slideout menu you can put a lot more stuff in it so if you do have a lot more stuff you might want to consider that instead so that this is kind of like the simple design I'm going to show you guys how I put this together and I think it will be still very informative for you so I'm gonna use the wireframes here and move this up a little bit maybe I can make this window a little bit bigger for you guys there we go now the one cool thing about sketch is that you can kind of keep all of your documents inside this one sketch document you have this concept called pages so this where we have this page where we have these wireframes I can just name this page with wireframes and then I can create a new page and I couldn't call this like v1 design for example and then it's empty right now I'm gonna start a new artboard a new artboard is kind of like just a frame for your design so choosing something like this now for the background all I did was add a shape you'll have you'll have these shapes in figma as well so I created a rectangle and I use the shortcut key are you could also go insert up here and choose shape you have all these different types of shapes and usually the same thing in figma when you click on an object or an element on the right hand side you can find all of the configurable attributes and properties for it so for example for this guy actually they changed there it is so the recently I upgraded sketch to the latest version and they change the UI a little bit so all of the buttons placements which I'm used to they've kind of moved them around so if you see me fumbling a little bit that's that's kind of why so I'm gonna change this color and you can pick a solid color or pick a gradient so for example I have a couple of preset gradients but for this app I chose something like of a dark blue no I'm not actually married to this so here's the beginning color I really like the rich dark blue I like that let me just check on the chat someone using a super chat sorry oh sorry you guys oh you guys have been not looking at my screen sorry about this let me change this right now alright so it looks like I have not mastered the use of my livestream software so sorry about that you guys right now you should be seeing my screen you should be seeing sketch luckily we haven't gone too far into it yet but this is what I have so far so I apologize to you guys who are watching super super sorry about that alright alright cool cool cool so I'm super sorry about that you guys so basically what I did started with an art board okay and put a shape on it put a gradient on it and now we're going to create the design for it did you guys even see the design then here let me show you guys what I'm setting out to create I don't even know if the screen was on at this time if you guys were able to see this probably not but this is the simple design that I'm showing you how to recreate now so it's got the timer the other two timers on the left and right side it's going to slide up to create a tab bar sorry to show a tab bar with all of the different sections and that's basically it alright so the next thing we're gonna do is put a circular shape so we can go to shape oval and same thing I think into all graphics apps they do this if you hold down the shift button and you click and drag you're going to create a perfect circle but if you don't hold down shift you're going to be able to create ovals so I can create and oval like that I'll put it in the center and I'm gonna get rid of the fill and instead I'm going to use the border so for this width let's put something like 8 and it's arbitrary for me right now I'm gonna change this solid color to a gradient so for this gradient I'll show you something neat so gradients usually go from one color to another color you can also add kind of stops in between those two gradients and you can kind of change them to other colors like this but if you want to show progress like in the beginning when I was first using these graphics programs I could never understand what this angular gradient was used for but now I kind of understand it's to show progress so you know progress bar sometimes they have like a dark color to a light color or a light to a dark color for a circular progress ring like this this would be the perfect opportunity to use this sort of angular gradient so for example I can use and change like a maybe a dark pink to like a light pink so you can play around with that I'm not going to spend too much time fiddling around with this but there's that next we can insert like a piece of text so you can go here there it is so that's my default font it's way too big and I'll use the e the San Francisco font and we can customize the font if we'd like when we actually oops so put that in the middle we'll make it a little bigger you can even choose a variation so we can go light which i think is what I ended up doing or ultra light I'm gonna use display so I can go for the ultra light there and then for the icon I use a service called icons 8 which has this desktop app which gives me all these different icons for me I can use in my app it's not a free actually you can use it for free but I think there are certain limitations on the sizes that you get so for what I have right now I have I'm paying I think $99 a year for access to all of their icons at whatever size is that I'd like and I think it's totally worth it because aside from using it for apps I also use it for my thumbnails and websites and stuff like that so I can drag a play icon like that on the screen and then you can actually further customize it so I can change the color because it's an SVG so I can enlarge it a little bit or shrink it or do whatever like that so for the glow for this ring what I ended up doing was you can see here on the left hand side I have the Oval selected and I just duplicated it and I can call this layer the glow and for this one I gave it a blur effect so you can see I can blur it a lot more so it's actually like two rings one the first ring that's sitting on top is the solid ring with the the lines the rigid lines but then the ring behind it I'm setting it to like a blurry version of it so it almost gives off a glow so that's how you're going to achieve that and one thing I will mention now is that you know this is the design but when it comes to implementing this design into your Xcode project you're not going to be turning everything into graphic assets because a lot actually can be accomplished through code just programming so for example these labels right we can set we can use a UI label we can set a custom font to it as you know set the size and even gradients you can you don't need an image so you can do gradients in the code I'm for me personally I have to figure out how I'm going to be drawing the circle of progress rings but I know you can do it so I'm not going to be exporting those as images and the glows again you can do those through code so it's faster and so you want to do as much with code as you can instead of images so the next thing I'm going to do is basically group my two rings together like that and you can do groups in figma as well I'm gonna call this a I'm just going to call this a ring and I'm going to duplicate this ring and then I can drag it to the left and then I can duplicate another ring and I can drag it to the right and let me just check the messages just see nothing's going wrong oh and a kill are you making a wireframe so sorry guys with that technical difficulty in the beginning you guys might have missed it but I did create a set of wireframes for it it is in the same document there we go so this is what we did in the last livestream together so this is now kind of like the design composites off of the wireframes so for this I'll say this oval one I can just pick a different color a different glow color for this ring can do the same thing so I'm just changing the the colors on those guys and that's basically how I created this design it's gonna be very simple for this v1 version I'm just focusing on getting it launched and getting it to be a working Pomodoro timer oh yeah that's basically it using using figma will be pretty much the same thing and it's free so I would use that first personally but I already have a sketch license and I got used to using sketch before figma came out and so that's why I'm using this personally right now so let me save that and that's kind of me the basic design for the app and next up we're going to talk about the local notifications that's it let me just show you what we have done in the previous livestream let me launch this app in the last livestream I've showed you guys how to have a timer run in the background and it's not what you think it's not like you need to set some background tasks and you know have the timer actually running in the background it's actually setting an end date and when you come back into the app it's checking your current date versus the end date and we're doing some calculations to figure out how we should continue that timer or if the timer is actually done so this is what we created in the previous lesson or the previous livestream so it's just the timer like that seven and even if you leave it there you come back it's at 200 now right so we didn't program for that and it keeps going down but what I want to show you guys today is if the timer is running like this and I mean if we're in the app and it runs out we can notify the user and play a sound hey your your timer is done your Pomodoro is done so move on to your next task or start another Pomodoro or go to your break but what happens if you know the user launches it and then they leave the app and they go do something else and then the timer runs out right we still want to notify them that the the Pomodoro is up and so what we have to do instead is we have to schedule a local notification to fire it's like a push notification except it's scheduled locally by your app when when the user hits starts the timer we have to schedule that notification so that is what I set out to do and that's what I'm going to show you now I didn't know how to do it to be in with by I knew something like that existed and it could be done so I started off by typing in UI local notification because I knew that this was what the class was called never worked with it but the first result is Apple documentation and so that's great that's what you want but then I noticed that this whole class is actually deprecated which if you're not familiar with the term means that Apple retired that class and they will or may stop supporting this in future releases and this was deprecated I was 10 so that tells you how often I use this right and I didn't even know so the thing is they didn't tell me what class it was replaced with because usually when they deprecated something they roll that functionality into another class or they just changed the name or they created an entirely new class they didn't tell me right here what it was replaced with so I actually had just to go back to the Google results and I noticed that there was a stack overflow and usually that comes with some discussion so this told me this guy told me that it was now rolled into the user notifications framework and so that gave me kind of my next thing to figure out okay it's called user notifications so just grab that you go back to Google type it in and you can see some tutorials at the so that's great or if once you become familiar with reading documentation and interpreting it it's actually faster just to go into the documentation and look at the classes and Apple documentation is pretty good now because not only it usually just be a listing of like methods in that class and maybe the protocols and all that stuff but these days they actually it's pretty indepth but it's almost like a tutorial so going through this documentation and you go to topics I noticed that there is a tutorial or a little section on asking permission to use notifications and I noticed this myself when you're using apps they always pop up a little window and asks you can I can this app play notifications for you and so this piece of this piece is going to be something that we'll need but I continue to scroll down notification management remote notifications notifications requests and in here scheduling a notification locally from your app this is exactly what I want to do so I go ahead and click this and I read all of this stuff and basically what I did was just to try it things out I copied the sample code that they have right here so that's what I'm going to show you what I'm doing here right so configuring the notification content so I copied all of this right let's say and I just as a test right I just put it in the viewdidload so I want to see if this works configure local notification specify the conditions for delivery so you can either trigger it from a calendar or a time interval or a location so that's kind of cool right I don't know if you use any grocery apps with with loyalty cards but if you do like I have one called Longo's and whenever i'm close to a Longo's i'm driving by it it always gives me a notification pops up my loyalty card and tells me like oh you might be going to long goes right so here's her loyalty card so that's probably what it's doing there which is pretty cool but what we're going to do is use the calendar notification because we have a date and a time which that timer expires right and so we want to we want to trigger it based on that end date I'm just checking the chat really quickly thank thank you Marcus for letting people know that we have a Facebook on community Facebook community so you can go there and ask questions and get help on your iOS journey and lots of helpful people in there all right so the next part is we're going to configure the date now this is to configure a recurring date and I don't necessarily want to do that so this here is creating a date components class all right so I know I need a date component object because that is what gets passed into this UN calendar notification trigger so if you take if if you were following in the last stream you know that what we do is when the user starts the timer so here in this method we schedule a timer based on however minutes it is so 25 minutes and then we set an end date now this end date is just a date object so now in my head I know I need to convert this date object into a date components object so that I can pass that into this UN calendar trigger right and for repeats I would just put false because my timer is not gonna continually repeat so I copy this chunk of code and I just put here and here it starts saying like oh it doesn't know what this class is so what you have to do if you're using this is just import the user notifications framework so that it recognizes all of these classes right all right so it's complaining about date components because I actually don't have any date components right now so we're gonna have to to do change a date into into date components so we'll figure that out in a second but first we're going to continue with the next task so here it's creating a request based on a uu ID and this is going to be the identifier for that scheduled notification so that in the future if you keep track of this UID you can cancel it right you just in case you need to like modify it or cancel it or whatever this UUID string is this identifier is how you're going to get a reference to it and then you also pass in the content which is this guy right here so the meet of the actual notification and then the trigger which contains the date it's supposed to trigger at and whether or not it repeats so that all of that comes together into a notification request and then you pass that request into the user notification center and that's how that all gets scheduled so we're going to copy this chunk of code and we are going to put it down here so let's configure some of this stuff that we need so first of all back here in the trigger repeats is false because we don't want it to repeat date components let's create a variable for date component component so let's say we have an end date first so our end date let's let should we have a property so I'm gonna say end date is equal to the current date and time and we're add I'm gonna add like 10 seconds to it and then in order to come convert it to date components I had to look this up to let me see if I can remember it right now because I kind of don't remember it so let date components equal take components dot yeah I don't remember it so all you need to do is just google it date components to date or sorry it's the other way around date to date components Swift and yeah you can see that this is the post that I saw right here and by scanning the code you can see that all you need to do is this calendar the calendar class I get the current calendar and then use this date components method specify which components you want and then pass in the date that you want to convert to the date components all right so that's what we're going to do calendar dot current date components and we pass in the components that we want as a set and so we'll do a year month day hour minutes and seconds and then the date what you want to pass in is this end date okay so now we have a set of date components from our date object and let's see what this error is complaining about I'm going to force and rap it because why would this not be able to get a current date oh you know what end date is an optional we declared it up as an optional up here I forgotten so that's why we have to unwrap it down here all right so now we have our date components we're gonna pass that into the notification trigger and then we create the request off of the content and the trigger so let's change the content a little bit pomodoro app your Pomodoro is up and then we are going to just schedule it so then I tried this first and I'm gonna save you from the trouble I tried this first and it wasn't working and that's when I remembered going back here to the documentation that I needed to ask the user permission first to show them notifications and so I click this and this is what we're after we want to show this little popup to allow the user to choose yes or no request author a ssin at launch time so I just basically copied this piece of code and I put it here and then I was able to pop up that little window to let the user say allow or disallow I'm gonna move this piece of code to schedule the notification I'm going to move it to actually when the user hits start on the timer because it shouldn't actually run until here so when the user starts the timer that's when we're going to configure the notification we we don't have to set an end date because it was set up here and then we get the date component so we create the trigger we create the request and then we schedule it so let's try it if it were so here my main point is just to show you guys kind of like how to read documentation and like even for someone like me who has been working with Swift and building apps and stuff you know I don't know everything and that this is how easy it is to find out how to do something so again all you need is that kind of base foundation for Xcode and Swift and to understand how iOS works and everything else you can you can research and you can figure out there's no way you'll be able to explore all of the iOS SDK and don't feel like you need to memorize and know everything because you really don't so I'm gonna click allow' here and I'm gonna click start and I'm going to exit the app and then it will wait maybe five more seconds and we should see that notification pop up there see there it goes so that's pretty cool right let me check the chat really quickly hey Adrienne nice to see you man glad you can join how was the Halloween party Adrienne's kids are the cutest so my kids actually had a Halloween party too at school but I didn't have to go so this is how you know my point again is to show you guys how easy it is to read documentation and kind of give you a demo of that this is still demo code like this is not how the real live app is going to be but if you guys have been following on this Pomodoro timer app I'm treating this app seriously so it's not just a demo for you guys or for the channel I'm actually publishing this I'm going to create a website behind it I'm going to promote it put a marketing plan together for this app and we're gonna try to get a user base on it and try to hopefully in the future monetize it a little bit and you know I'm glad you guys are here on the ground so you can see kind of like how this all started so I have really high hopes for this app now I will be creating like the basic v1 version that you see here as a tutorial series on my channel alright so I am leveraging it as a tutorial series as well but personally I am also like I'm also personally invested in seeing this app succeed so that's kind of what I want to do oh and actually this design looks a little bit different from this one I forgot to put that sort of semitransparent circle right there but that's all I did was for the for the ring right here for the oval um instead of specifying no fill I did give it a fill so I just chose something like that whatever color it was and then I set the opacity to like semitransparent that's what I did there alright so that's all of the content I had for you guys today that's all I wanted to show you guys today I'm gonna jump into the chat now see if you guys have any questions or if you do type them in the chat right now I'm gonna answer your questions Joan for if you don't have a Mac but you have an iPad you can start learning so on the iPad Apple has a playgrounds app it's really really good oh you know what let me transition to this part yeah so that playgrounds app for iPad is really really good it teaches you how to use Xcode how do you Swift mostly though so you can start learning but eventually you will need a Mac to develop if you want to use like the official Apple tools and you want to develop natively for the iOS you will need a Mac and there are several options you could buy a used Mac even a Mac Mini will do you can use a remote service like Mac and cloud or Mac Stadium or something that allows you to remotely log into a Mac with a PC like a Windows desktop and then you can use it through that or you can you can virtualize it on your PC but we're starting to get a little technical if you're not we actually have an article on our website you can just maybe you can reach out and I can send you the link to that but gives you several options for PC users to create iOS apps Shane do you do this as a career coating Shane yeah so I started off as a software consultant building apps for other clients and I was part of a company I was basically an employee and then I discovered my passion for teaching and there was an audience a lot of you guys out there want to learn how to make apps and so I honestly found a lot more fulfilling than building apps for clients and so I think in the process of a year now this has become my fulltime job and I'm basically my income comes from you guys supporting code with Chris through the courses and through YouTube so thank you so much because I wouldn't be here without you guys let's see yeah fellow Roxy put your chat next to your working monitor so he can see both so I was thinking of of doing a dual monitor setup so I can put the chat right now I have my laptop which is I'm seeing myself livestreaming as well or you can get kind of fancy and you can have sort of frame and have your chat but as you can see you guys were watching my face when I thought you guys could see the screen so I need to figure that software out first but I think I'm gonna go dual monitor all right so Iona's asking can you connect this design and Xcode yeah you can so there is actually you can either so there are a couple of different options so the first option is you need to try to replicate as much as possible through code rather than relying on exporting image graphics and then putting it into Xcode barring that your next step is to take what elements that cannot be created programmatically and you can use images right to style your style your elements another cool thing which I showed in I think my very first lesson is figma actually if you select an element in figma it tells you the swift code to generate that element and I don't know how perfect it is because I haven't used it extensively but I just wanted to let you know that it's there and there's also something else which I talked to my coworker my ex coworkers who are still working at the consultant company and they tell me that they use something called Zeppelin now which kind of bridges the gap between the development team and the design team oh you guys can't see my screen again I'm sorry you see this live streaming thing thanks so much for bearing with me so Zeppelin this thing is supposed to bridge the gap between development teams and designer teams and I have never used it before I'm interested in taking a look at what kind of like how to use it but what my guess is that so like selecting a element gives you the code yeah it looks like it gives you the code for it and the cool thing is that you can upload your sketch designs and your figma designs straight into Zeppelin and then it looks like developers and designers can also comment on the design yeah so it's worth it's worth exploring I think so this is a another way which you can use sorry another tool to use to implement your design into Xcode but I think the main thing is to basically use use code to style your elements and then whatever else you can't style to use images Glenn v2 is actually a lot a ton of features so let me show you what that is so this basic Pomodoro app is just like v1 is just the timers right but we have all of these features that I have planned for this app to make it the app that I think is missing out there in the marketplace today and that is the ability to add friends and challenge each other motivate each other to basically complete Pomodoro's so for the productivity focused people it adds a social element to it because I think traditionally this Pomodoro Technique is a very individual thing you want yourself to be focused and complete work and stuff but I got this idea from someone else where they challenge each like there were two friends both using the Pomodoro Technique and they would share how many Pomodoro's they could finish that day and it would motivate them they've motivate each other to do more and to be more productive and to stay focused and so that I'm just translating that into an app which doesn't exist right now all of the apps out there in the marketplace their Pomodoro timers with built in maybe todo lists or like habit trackers or stuff like that but no social elements to it so that's the idea behind this whole project a v1 is just a simple barebones Pomodoro timer which most people which is even below what's out there today so I don't see why people would use my v1 versus a more fullfeatured app but I need to get it out there to motivate myself to keep going because I know that if I then too much time on a project without without getting some feedback and sending it out there and seeing some progress then I lose motivation and I'm not gonna get to all of this other cool stuff that's planned for the app so I need to get v1 out there in the App Store even if no one's gonna use it but once we get like v2 or v3 and we start getting people's feedback and we start implementing some of these features which don't exist out there right now that's when I see the app gaining some more traction so that's kind of the plan right there yeah karo so Doby XD i think is even if you don't have Creative Cloud now I don't know if you know this but Adobe XD is free actually they made it free maybe to try to get more adoption for the program so I've heard some good things about it if you searched up Adobe XD on YouTube there will be some tutorials for it I've seen that unfortunately I don't know how similar it is to sketch but if I had to guess I would say it's pretty similar yeah so Glen exactly yeah XD is free Iona so a lot of this design that you see here on the screen I think I can do through code so once I start once I get to that point where I'm implementing the design in code like for sure this this gradient background I can do through code the custom label I can do through code like these gradients I can do through semitransparency I can do through code the glow I can do through code the progress ring filling up I can do through code so like I think pretty much I can do most of it through code this button the simple shape you might even be able to do through code yeah at this point right now for this kind of like simple design I think a lot of this can be done via code once we get into like moving backgrounds and all that stuff maybe then it won't be as much any more questions guys fergan asks can we create this app using react native or any other crossplatform tool let me just change this back so my answer to you is probably yes to be honest I haven't used react native so I can't tell you definitely yes or no but this app is pretty simple I don't see why you wouldn't be able to to do that it's just a different discipline it's like a different set of tools right it's a different language yeah like I don't see why not and if your followup question is like why when I use react native to to create this and the only reason for that is because what kind of like what I've learned in the past and what got me to this point was just objectivec Swift and Xcode and stuff so that's what I know and that's what kind of like my comfort zone I guess you would say so that's why I'm building this for iOS using Xcode and Swift but if you were just getting into mobile app development I don't see why you want to explore react native first and it's something that I've wanted to look into myself it's just time is always a constraint right but that's that's my reasoning Glenn will the code be on github it will be it will be available to the public I don't know if it will be github or any other format but yes the code will be available maybe not the full feature set right because at some point if I'm going to be you know turning this trying to turn this into a viable business and trying to make some money off of it at that point doesn't make sense for me to just put the whole source code for the entire app out there right so I think I will be like I'll show you guys how to build this v1 for sure and v2 maybe with some social features and all that stuff but I have to cut it off at some point in terms of the the key code base but I will continue to share with you guys my learnings and the progress of how the app is doing in the App Store how I'm planning features kind of the setbacks that I'm going to experience with it all that stuff right I'm gonna be transparent about that Carl what assets can you import from sketch into Xcode so in sketch mainly you'll be exporting these elements so you're gonna have to see right in sketching and figma I'm not sure about Dobey XD but there's going to be some way for you to export some of these elements out as graphics or as PDF or something like that so you can see you can't see the screen sorry right here I've got the circle selected and in sketch you can choose a image format to export it in so PNG JPEG PDF or whatever and the sizes and you would basically export them and import them into the asset library of Xcode and then you'll be able to select those images when let's say you're styling an image view or a button or something like that you'll have access to those assets in the asset library the danger is to try to make everything in image asset and just do it that way it's gonna work for you but it's just not as optimized for performance as it could be so maybe as a beginner if you know you trying to get it out the door and try to get it done I wouldn't necessarily say it's a bad thing because I know for beginners from my experience teaching people the most important thing is not like how perfect your code is how you know what's the right way what's the wrong way and getting caught up with all of that it really is it's it's a mentality it's a motivation it's it's a it's it's a mental game really too because a lot so many people give up right and so I want to see as many people succeed as well so I always say there is a better way but I'm not gonna say that's the only way right so as a beginner I would put more importance on gaining more experience building more apps making more mistakes kind of you know getting those notches on your belt is more important than trying to write like the perfect code trying to design the perfect app trying to do everything the right way because you can get so caught up in that that it gets discouraging to be honest honestly as a as a beginner you're just gonna feel like wow this is so tedious this is so hard so convoluted to try to make this you know super optimized and you're not gonna have fun you have to be having fun with it if you're gonna stick with it and then when you get like really serious about it and you're gonna start applying for jobs and I don't know start building like a big apps trying to make money or whatever then you can start learning about how to optimize your code for performance and how to do things like follow best practices and stuff and it's not too late you know it's not too late it's not like golf I feel like when I was learning golf it was imperative that you kind of trained your muscles and your movements right from the beginning so you don't kind of develop these bad habits are become really hard to correct but for coding you can develop bad habits but it's not like you cannot correct it because it's not muscle memory right you just have to remember oh I should be doing it this way I shouldn't be doing it that way all right let's check out what other questions you guys have I own a so why do this with another tool if it can be implemented directly through code so that's an individual developer yeah you're free to just start like just implementing a design in Xcode but if you're following kind of like a traditional app development process and maybe this just applies because I was working with clients right you have to show them what they're gonna get before you go and work on it and so the doing the wireframes right showed them where all of the elements was going to be how how the user would interact with the screens and how many screens there were where the popups were and all of that stuff and they would basically sign off on that and say yes this looks good to us before we proceeded to this step which is styling everything in and adding color and emotion to the app showing how some of the animations might work and then they sign off on that and then then you start developing it so I guess maybe in a way it was to protect the company right but as an individual developer I feel like it's still a good idea to do this because it gives you like a roadmap for when you when you go down the development path because if you're trying to design things as you're developing it you there will be a lot of backandforth like a lot of backtracking and that can lead to a lot of code like bloat and you might leave pieces of code that you don't use anymore in your project so it's almost like having this doing it this doing these graphic comps in a graphics program gives you a roadmap to do your development aidan so thank you thank you about the compliment for the design I really wanted to make it minimal so you can focus like it's clean so it's not cluttered so you can focus on your work yes the background is gonna run in the background it's what we did in the previous livestream so you'll find out on my channel in part 2 I showed you guys how to keep a timer or how we're going to keep the time even if the user is out of the app and in this livestream I showed you guys how to notify that the timer is up even if the user is not in the app so yeah Timothy unfortunately I don't know too much about vapor but I know there are a lot of tutorials good a good tutorials out there yeah Glen so you meant v1 before yeah the v1 code it will be out there I don't know if it will be on you guys should start using github traditionally I just like zipped it up and sent it to people but what do you use for icon creation for the various sizes Glen I actually have a video on that in my channel so just go over to my channel page click on the videos and then it's maybe like four or five videos down it was pretty recent so you can check that out any more questions you guys I've got a couple more minutes left so again I want to thank you guys all for joining and helping me feel so comfortable on the live stream just hanging out with you guys so actually let me know I want to give you guys a question so in these live streams you guys are seeing me like build build stuff to show you guys code and all that stuff but I'm also thinking about having a like jam session you know how our name is code with Chris and so this live stream will basically be me like us just coding together so I'm coding my thing you can see my screen I'll have headphones on and I'll be coding we can have a chat going and you can code you can learn or code your own thing right well it's basically just the jam session a code jam session where as if we were all working like at a table and I won't really be focusing on teaching rather I'll be focusing on building stuff like maybe building demos for future tutorials or building apps that I would like to build just me or me learning through different tutorials because I'm constantly learning as well but just like hanging out chatting casual so I can do a lot more of those because I don't have to prepare anything for it so let me know if you is that's something that you would want to join and just you know you know when it's gonna be each week and it's just a time which you were gonna set aside so that you can learn some coding or do some coding and we can do it do that together let me know Glenn I missed your question what is your view on splash screens with an app so my my view I actually subscribe to the Apple view of what to do with splash screens which is or otherwise no one has launched screens and if you go into their human interface guidelines they have some guidance on what to do with launch screens and that is not to show your logo not to show like loading bars or whatever I know games are notorious for doing this sort of stuff but for in terms of apps their guidance is basically to show your home screen like a bear version of your home screen so that it gives the illusion that when people tap on your app icon your app launches really really fast because that launch screen if it looks like your home screen and then it transitions into your actual home screen with the data coming in it feels like your app was like really quick and speedy and I think when apps launch really slow people tend to not want to use them as much so that's the guidance that Apple gives and that's what I think like I agree with that alright thanks for giving me some validation on my coach ahem idea so you guys can actually be coding with Chris and I know for a lot of people they can't find time you know they want to learn how to code they want to learn Swift and Xcode but they just can't find time in their schedule to do it but for for a lot of people it's it's an issue of prioritizing it I think if if it's something that's high on your priority list to do then you're gonna make some time and prioritize it and so that's what my code Jam idea is is kind of revolving around the helping people have a time in their calendar they can set it there that during for that one hour they're gonna be sitting down with me and we're gonna be coding together I'm gonna be doing my thing you're gonna be even your thing and we can chat through chat if something you know if you is basically having some coding buddies do you think it's possible to make an app successful coding it only for Apple OS and Android I think those are the two major platforms but my point of view is that the app is the app but really what is gonna make your app successful is really the business plan and the marketing plan behind the app because I think it's pretty hard to like protect your app idea like once your app launches and it it's like one of a kind you're the first one there unique idea there's gonna be clones there's gonna be people who are who will create other versions of it so you know you you need to leverage that first mover advantage and have a solid business plan and marketing plan so that you you take that lead and turn it so so big that other competitors can't catch up with you is it difficult yeah exactly like floppy word is it difficult to write code out of your own mind or is this normal for a beginner yeah it's completely normal so if you ask me this is what the progression should be so as a beginner you should start doing so I have a I have a 28 day coding plan for beginners and I have that on my channel so you can actually follow those videos and that is the exact order of lessons of concepts taught and lessons to learn that I take all of my paying students through alright so after you get to that point you get that foundational layer I was talking about this the whole live stream after you have that base foundational knowledge you're not gonna know every single thing under the iOS SDK you're not gonna know how to do anything but no one knows how to do everything right there's the beauty of it once you have that foundational knowledge the next step is to build as many of these like demo type of apps as possible and you know there's a lot of content creators out there issuing tutorials on how to build different apps try to consume as many of it as possible because you're gonna get exposed to different architectures new new classes new how to do different features and stuff like that and you're gonna take all of that experience and when it comes time to build your own app you're coming up with something from scratch you you're gonna remember all of those demo apps that you've built and you're gonna be able to think in your head hey I did something similar to what I want to do now back then so let me pull that up take a look at it and you can you can adapt it and you can you know grow from there or stand on the shoulders of giants if you have no pool of experience to draw from it's really really hard for you to come up with something out of thin air right so just to reiterate have a plan like a lesson plan if you're starting out from scratch so that you at least get the foundation stuff in and then build as many like small demos as you can to get more to build up a pool of experience and then you can go and tackle your own app and because at that point you have this whole pool of experience to draw from all right so we're a little short on time um where can I find lessons to make a social media app phantom I would challenge you to define social media app a little bit more because a lot of people say they want to make social media apps and I have no idea what that means like you want to create the next Facebook or what but social media apps like if you're talking about a social network you want to create an app like a whole social network your own social network you need to start from the fundamental stuff and you can find that if you go on my channel page and just hit the things called like how to make how to make apps beginner series or something like that so check that out it's the war card game tutorial there's actually a couple more modules after that which is also available in my channel so go through all of that get that base foundational knowledge in and there are some free tutorials out there to implement social features for apps and at that point you'll be ready to tackle that but at this point what I would have challenge you to do is just define define what a social media app means to you very very well so you kind of know what what you set out to do the more vague your idea is the more likely it is to fail because you don't know what you don't know what you want right but if you can define exactly what you want down to like the screens and stuff like that you kind of have a plan so anyways happy Halloween guys I'm so happy to see all of you here same time next week and we'll do another livestream and at that point I think I will actually have most of this app done and I'm gonna release them as videos and so in the next live stream I talked about something else that revolves around this app and then hopefully in the middle of November or something will submit this app to the App Store view1 all right we'll do that together so thank you so much for joining guys again and have a happy Halloween and a great rest of the week see you guys later
