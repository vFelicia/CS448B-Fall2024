00:00 - have you heard of mukbang
00:12 - i don't even know if i'm saying it right
00:14 - but essentially it's just
00:15 - someone live streaming themselves eating
00:17 - food yeah you heard that right
00:19 - you just tune in and you watch someone
00:22 - eat and at first
00:23 - i didn't understand why someone would do
00:25 - this but then the more i thought about
00:27 - it the more it started to make sense
00:29 - you see it's a way to do something
00:31 - social maybe you live alone and you
00:33 - don't have anyone to eat with
00:34 - well you can tune in eat your meal and
00:37 - now
00:37 - you're not eating alone another example
00:40 - which i recently discovered
00:41 - is study with me live streaming and i
00:44 - didn't even know this was a thing
00:46 - people live streaming themselves
00:47 - studying and you can't even see what
00:49 - they're studying
00:49 - you just watch them sit there not moving
00:54 - [Music]
00:56 - studying
01:02 - [Music]
01:04 - and while this sounds extremely boring
01:06 - trust me there are a ton of people who
01:09 - tune in
01:09 - and then that got me thinking what would
01:11 - a code with me
01:13 - live stream look like the more i thought
01:15 - about this
01:16 - the more it grew on me you see i think
01:18 - most of us code alone especially
01:20 - now that everyone is doing everything
01:23 - remotely but what if we just got
01:24 - together
01:25 - hung out and coded together we'd be
01:28 - doing our own things and then
01:29 - on our coding breaks or study breaks we
01:32 - could interact with the chat
01:33 - and it would be like we were coding
01:35 - together
01:36 - physically apart but together virtually
01:39 - and i think
01:40 - at least for some of you that doing
01:42 - something together as a group
01:45 - would serve as motivation to get some
01:47 - more coding practice in
01:49 - so if you think that would help you
01:50 - please give this video a thumbs up
01:52 - personally for me i know it would keep
01:54 - me accountable to
01:56 - study and to code especially since i
01:58 - will have a live stream
02:00 - schedule so there's a set place and a
02:02 - set time for
02:03 - everybody to come together and do some
02:05 - coding
02:06 - now keep in mind that i won't be talking
02:08 - and i won't be teaching
02:10 - and you might not even be able to
02:11 - clearly see what's on my screen
02:13 - because that's not what the point of
02:15 - this is
02:16 - the point is to study or code together
02:19 - or if you'd like just
02:20 - come and hang out in the group chat so
02:22 - here's the schedule that i'm thinking
02:24 - about for the first week
02:25 - we're just gonna try it out and do an
02:27 - hour each day and then depending on
02:29 - how that goes we'll set the schedule for
02:31 - the following week
02:32 - you'll find the link to the schedule in
02:34 - the description below or just visit
02:36 - cwc.to
02:38 - livestream so what do you think i hope
02:40 - you can join in
02:41 - on one of these sessions if you're
02:43 - planning to and you think you might be
02:44 - able to
02:44 - drop a comment below to say i'll be
02:46 - there now this is the first time i'm
02:48 - doing something like this and i really
02:49 - hope it's gonna
02:50 - encourage more people to start coding
02:53 - and get some more
02:54 - coding practice in i know for me it's
02:56 - gonna help me learn new things and also
02:58 - to get a ton of practice in
03:00 - thanks for watching and i hope i'll see
03:01 - you there
03:05 - [Music]
03:08 - you
