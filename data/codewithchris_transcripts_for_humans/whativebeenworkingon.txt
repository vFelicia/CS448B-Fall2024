00:00 - hey code crew what's up it's chris here
00:02 - i hope you've
00:03 - all had a wonderful holiday season and i
00:06 - know i
00:06 - don't do these talking type of videos
00:08 - very often usually it's a tutorial
00:11 - but i wanted to take this opportunity to
00:13 - tell you about some of the things that
00:14 - i've been working on behind the scenes
00:16 - and now most of these things are
00:18 - launched or in progress
00:19 - and i'm really excited to share with you
00:21 - there are actually three things number
00:23 - one
00:23 - is cwc 3.0 or that's just what i call it
00:26 - but essentially it's a website revamp
00:29 - it's a little more than that and i'm
00:31 - really proud of how it turned out i want
00:33 - to walk you through this
00:34 - new experience and number two is
00:37 - the swift ui foundations course this
00:39 - course is in progress it continues off
00:41 - from the 14 day beginner challenge
00:43 - and i want to share what i've been doing
00:46 - in that
00:46 - number three is probably what i'm most
00:48 - excited about and it is
00:50 - an app case study that is currently
00:52 - underway
00:53 - and we just started this week my idea
00:55 - with this
00:56 - is to share behind the scenes and have
00:58 - you guys
00:59 - if you're interested to follow along
01:01 - with that journey as we try to
01:03 - build an app and turn it into a business
01:05 - i think it's going to be
01:06 - very interesting and i'll also share
01:09 - with you my motivations
01:11 - for doing this yeah i won't say too much
01:14 - right now but i'll save that for last
01:16 - all right let's hop on the computer so i
01:17 - can show you
01:19 - all right so let's first talk about the
01:21 - website revamp
01:22 - and it's more than just a style
01:25 - difference we actually migrated
01:27 - learning platforms from teachable to
01:29 - thinkific so
01:30 - we were using teachable before and this
01:32 - is what it looked like
01:33 - we've been using this for very many
01:36 - years
01:37 - it got to a point where we finally
01:40 - decided to change because
01:42 - we kept seeing the same complaints from
01:44 - our users over and over
01:46 - number one was that when they signed up
01:48 - for
01:50 - teachable teachable always prompted them
01:53 - to
01:54 - create a my teachable account or to link
01:56 - up this account to their
01:58 - my teachable account and it just
02:00 - confused the heck out of people
02:02 - to the point where a bunch of people
02:03 - even didn't want to continue after that
02:05 - because of how
02:06 - confusing that signup process was and
02:09 - these are
02:10 - our paying customers right who are
02:11 - signing up to cwc plus
02:14 - second thing is that the way that the
02:16 - courses are laid out
02:18 - doesn't really reflect our app journey
02:21 - that we always talk about there's
02:22 - different stages in the learning process
02:24 - and different courses
02:25 - associated with each step so this grid
02:29 - of courses
02:30 - a lot of people got confused about where
02:32 - to start especially
02:33 - once we started introducing swift ui
02:36 - content as well
02:37 - so people were confused do they start
02:38 - with this or they start with this and
02:40 - yeah i i will give them that it is very
02:42 - confusing so
02:43 - we finally decided to migrate to
02:46 - uh thinkific and this is what it looks
02:49 - like now the thing i like about
02:50 - thinkific is that
02:52 - everything is very customizable you're
02:54 - able to
02:56 - through code and through liquid
02:57 - templates customize every single aspect
02:59 - of the experience
03:00 - and so we decided to
03:04 - make the experience seamless so that
03:07 - it doesn't feel like you're going to
03:08 - another site from codewithchris.com
03:11 - and you can see this is when you're
03:13 - inside and you're on the learning
03:15 - platform and it still feels
03:17 - you know like the same site it was
03:19 - nowhere near
03:20 - the level of customization with
03:22 - teachable so with
03:23 - uh thinkific i'm able to depending on
03:26 - the role of the user
03:28 - uh give them a customized welcome video
03:30 - so whether they are
03:32 - a cbwc plus member or maybe they're just
03:35 - checking out our free courses
03:36 - i'm able to have some quick links up
03:38 - here and then i'm
03:40 - able to more importantly lay out the
03:42 - courses the way i want now this is all
03:43 - custom coding this doesn't come out of
03:45 - the box but
03:46 - i'm able to lay it out so p it's very
03:48 - clear where people start
03:51 - and then what they're supposed to do
03:52 - next and then after they finish the
03:54 - apprentice level courses where what
03:56 - they're supposed to do next
03:58 - from there and this is sort of like a
04:00 - mix and match explore
04:01 - um what interests you at this stage and
04:04 - then finally getting to the
04:05 - pro courses where um you're trying to
04:08 - meet your goals whether that's
04:09 - look for a job or to build a product
04:12 - so we were able to migrate to thinkific
04:15 - and at the same time i decided that
04:19 - with our forum that's running on
04:21 - discourse right now
04:22 - to also use a single sign-on
04:25 - with our wordpress site so the
04:27 - experience is going to be
04:29 - creating or signing into
04:31 - codewithchris.com
04:32 - and then you're automatically going to
04:34 - be signed into our form
04:36 - and right now that's not the case
04:37 - because we haven't actually performed
04:39 - that
04:40 - that link yet and
04:43 - they'll also be signed into the
04:45 - thinkific instance
04:47 - so i'm going to style the header here by
04:49 - the time you see this
04:50 - video that gets released this will
04:53 - probably be styled and then this will be
04:54 - linked up to the code with chris
04:56 - accounts
04:58 - but it's going to be a sort of unified
05:01 - experience
05:02 - so i'm really proud that we finally got
05:04 - this launched because
05:05 - i've been looking at this since october
05:08 - and i started going like way way out of
05:11 - scope because i started reimagining
05:13 - everything uh i was dabbling around and
05:16 - and trying to redesign our logo and
05:18 - redesign the home page and
05:20 - redesign the the layout of our blog
05:22 - posts and quickly
05:23 - sort of got out of hand and
05:26 - you know i'll talk about the logo a
05:28 - little bit because i feel like that's a
05:29 - little interesting
05:30 - from the get go our logo as you can see
05:33 - um here it's it's hard to read there's
05:36 - some text that's
05:37 - illegible like the width over there it's
05:40 - also hard to put in a circular format as
05:41 - you can see
05:42 - in this tab up here it doesn't really
05:44 - look good
05:45 - in circular format and also as a
05:49 - watermark
05:50 - it's it does also doesn't really work i
05:53 - really love this logo though because
05:54 - it's our first original like og logo so
05:57 - i'm gonna
05:59 - still pay homage to that with this new
06:01 - logo but
06:02 - this one is a little more modern and
06:04 - it's way easier to work with
06:07 - so that's what we ended up going with
06:09 - and i'm going to leave the restyling of
06:11 - the home page and a whole bunch of other
06:13 - pages on our site that i wanted to
06:15 - modify i'll leave that for later
06:17 - anyway so that's the website revamp
06:20 - that is just finishing up
06:23 - next i want to talk about the courses
06:26 - that i'm
06:26 - currently working on inside cwc plus
06:30 - so i just gave myself access to
06:32 - everything and as you can see
06:33 - the welcome video is different for
06:36 - someone who logs in as a cwc plus member
06:38 - this sort of customization wouldn't have
06:40 - been available through teachable
06:42 - so again it's very clear where you start
06:44 - you start here and then you come down
06:46 - here and you're taking these apprentice
06:48 - level courses
06:49 - from foundations to databases to design
06:51 - now foundations continues off
06:53 - where the 14 day beginner challenge
06:54 - leaves off
06:56 - and if i go into this course i just want
06:57 - to tell you a little bit more about what
07:00 - i'm working on
07:02 - the reason why this is actually so
07:04 - interesting to me is because
07:06 - we've had this sort of three course
07:09 - learning path since the beginning and we
07:12 - did it
07:13 - with ui kit here and you know people
07:16 - really had a great experience with this
07:18 - but we've had this
07:21 - for many years and we've basically
07:23 - updated it as
07:24 - apple has come up with new versions of
07:26 - swift and xcode but it wasn't until
07:29 - doing the swift ui version that i was
07:31 - able to
07:33 - completely change it up right reimagine
07:35 - it from the ground up and i was able to
07:37 - incorporate
07:38 - so much feedback from um from the
07:41 - students
07:41 - and from users like yourself so for
07:43 - example some of the things
07:45 - that were improved a lot of people said
07:47 - it was very hard to
07:49 - after they finished the course to refer
07:51 - back to content
07:52 - if they forgot something so we took this
07:55 - opportunity to
07:56 - create topic indexes for lessons so this
07:59 - is really going to help with that
08:01 - in terms of using the course as
08:03 - reference after you've completed it
08:06 - the other thing is that inside the
08:09 - course
08:10 - i noticed that after people finished
08:13 - the course and they were uh going to
08:16 - create their own personal projects that
08:18 - a lot of people were just losing code
08:20 - forgetting where they put it or making a
08:23 - change and breaking their project and
08:24 - not being able to go back and that sort
08:26 - of thing
08:26 - and i realized how crucial of a topic
08:29 - source control is even if you're not
08:31 - working in a team
08:32 - and it's for your personal projects and
08:34 - so i've decided to incorporate that
08:36 - into the foundations course just showing
08:39 - you
08:39 - at a bare minimum how to set up your
08:42 - private repos
08:42 - and how to um commit and push your code
08:46 - even for just your personal projects
08:48 - another thing
08:49 - is that the learning experience
08:52 - from from talking with the students a
08:55 - lot of the learning comes from
08:56 - the actual um doing of
09:00 - the work and that comes to no surprise
09:02 - but sometimes
09:03 - people if not if they don't
09:06 - if they aren't given the opportunity to
09:09 - to practice and do the work
09:11 - then it's less likely that they will on
09:13 - their own right
09:14 - i always said after you watch the lesson
09:16 - you should try it out
09:18 - on your own and i don't think that was
09:19 - enough
09:21 - so in the old ui kit version of the
09:22 - courses i would have some quizzes
09:25 - i would have some exercises scattered
09:28 - throughout the course
09:29 - and people responded really well to that
09:33 - they wanted more of it and so in this
09:35 - version of the course i've made an
09:37 - effort to
09:37 - create a quiz and create challenges for
09:39 - every single lesson
09:41 - and it's not long you know it's not
09:42 - tough but it does
09:44 - give people an opportunity and a reason
09:47 - to
09:47 - make sure that they have the concepts
09:49 - they need to know before they move on
09:51 - and another thing that this helps with
09:55 - is the marketability of the course for
09:58 - classrooms and for
10:00 - you know educational institutes because
10:02 - we tried working with
10:03 - schools with our ui kit courses and we
10:07 - realized that
10:08 - if you want it to be an actual
10:09 - curriculum in a school
10:11 - there has to be a lot more hands-on work
10:13 - and can't just be like a series of
10:15 - videos that people
10:16 - watch passively and so we had set out to
10:20 - create all of that material after the
10:22 - fact and it was a lot harder to do
10:24 - whereas right now
10:26 - i am creating these quizzes and
10:27 - challenges as we go along
10:30 - and you know the quiz like i said isn't
10:33 - long
10:33 - but i think one of the the main aspects
10:38 - that's good about thinkific is and i
10:41 - don't know why
10:41 - this doesn't exist in teachable but when
10:43 - you answer a quiz question
10:45 - it gives you an opportunity to write a
10:48 - message telling people
10:49 - like why that's right or why that's
10:52 - wrong
10:52 - uh and also giving them like maybe a
10:54 - little summary about
10:57 - why that's the right answer in teachable
10:59 - it's either right or wrong
11:00 - and you don't have the opportunity as an
11:02 - educator to write anything else
11:04 - so i i really like this and i don't know
11:07 - if that's right or wrong because i'm not
11:08 - reading the question
11:09 - but yeah i really like this so i made an
11:11 - effort to fill out sort of an
11:13 - explanation for
11:14 - every single question and the challenges
11:16 - aren't long
11:17 - right but it gives an opportunity for
11:19 - people to
11:21 - to test something out so in short what
11:23 - i'm working on right now
11:25 - modules one two and three are done and
11:27 - released modules
11:29 - four five and six are in development and
11:32 - half of the database course is done and
11:34 - none of the design course is done so if
11:36 - we go back here for a second
11:38 - behind the scenes when i'm not recording
11:40 - and producing youtube tutorials this is
11:41 - what i'm working on
11:43 - um yeah and most of these courses here
11:47 - are are finished now all of them are
11:50 - finished or
11:51 - content is coming out for them um
11:54 - gradually
11:56 - next i want to talk about the
11:59 - app case study which is down here at the
12:01 - pro level but before i do that
12:03 - i want to talk about the motivation for
12:05 - these
12:06 - pro stage courses and what they're all
12:08 - about now
12:10 - when i was reimagining you know code
12:13 - with chris for 2021
12:15 - i i was really asking myself um you know
12:18 - sort of what
12:19 - why why code with chris right why
12:23 - uh and i think there are so many choices
12:26 - out there especially for you know paid
12:27 - programs or paid courses and stuff like
12:29 - that and
12:30 - i identified the
12:34 - i identified that
12:38 - i wanted to help people get a result so
12:40 - i didn't just want to teach them
12:42 - how to code or show them you know swift
12:45 - ui i wanted to help them reach their
12:47 - goal
12:47 - whatever that might be and make a
12:48 - transformation so when we talked with
12:51 - our
12:52 - students and we talked about talked with
12:54 - members of our audience
12:55 - um the two things the two themes
12:59 - that stood out were a career
13:02 - right so that's freelancer consultant or
13:04 - job as an ios developer
13:05 - and be wanting to build their own app or
13:08 - to build
13:09 - a business or surrounding an app so i
13:11 - wanted to
13:14 - shape this path this app journey as we
13:16 - like to call it
13:17 - as you can come in here having no coding
13:21 - experience right starting right here
13:24 - and if you've taken the 14 day beginner
13:26 - challenge or you've seen these videos on
13:28 - youtube you'll
13:28 - know that it really starts with
13:32 - no coding experience needed so you pick
13:35 - up those skills
13:37 - you expand on those skills based on your
13:39 - interests or what you need for
13:41 - your app or looking for job and then
13:44 - when you get to this stage
13:45 - it's material to help you with either of
13:48 - those two goals
13:49 - now in terms of the career oriented
13:51 - stuff we're going to work on that after
13:55 - the building and app business stuff so
13:58 - this product framework in this
13:59 - three month app case study is really the
14:02 - goal
14:03 - is to help people build their own app or
14:06 - build their own app business
14:07 - so that's the motivation between these
14:09 - two things now in terms of what they
14:11 - are our product framework these are the
14:13 - steps we're going to follow
14:15 - to build a successful app
14:18 - and then the case study is real time
14:20 - we're doing this right now
14:21 - we just started this week is an
14:24 - over-the-shoulder look
14:26 - at us attempting to build a successful
14:28 - app business
14:29 - and the reason i'm so excited for this
14:31 - is because this is new territory for me
14:34 - you see in my previous job we built apps
14:36 - for clients
14:37 - and success for us meant that we
14:40 - delivered
14:40 - an app to them on spec on time and on
14:43 - budget and
14:44 - after that whatever happens we weren't
14:47 - accountable for those results
14:48 - but in terms of building a successful
14:52 - app or a successful app business you
14:55 - have to be
14:55 - invested in what happens after you
14:57 - launch the app in fact most of the
14:59 - action happens after you launch the app
15:01 - so
15:02 - that is all new to me so this product
15:04 - framework
15:05 - is really our best guess at this point
15:08 - based on
15:08 - what we know and we're gonna update and
15:11 - iterate on this framework
15:12 - as we prove it out by applying it
15:15 - through this three-month ab case study
15:18 - our goal in three months is to
15:22 - follow these phases that i've outlined
15:24 - in here
15:25 - and launch an app and get our first
15:27 - customer so we're going to try and do
15:28 - that in three months
15:29 - and based on what happens in here we'll
15:31 - probably be updating
15:32 - and proving or disproving our
15:35 - assumptions in the framework
15:38 - now the reason i bring this up is
15:39 - because the three-month case study is
15:41 - something that i want
15:43 - anybody to be able to follow along and
15:46 - even though this is part of the cwc plus
15:49 - program
15:50 - i think in here i'm going to share um
15:54 - you know maybe more finer details about
15:56 - what's happening
15:57 - so for example what i have right now
15:59 - since this just started this week
16:01 - um i'm documenting the meetings that
16:04 - we're having the decisions we're making
16:06 - uh what we talked about and so it's very
16:09 - detailed information
16:11 - um you know technical feasibility
16:13 - questions we're
16:14 - asking how we're going to go about
16:16 - answering them action items
16:18 - uh what we're doing from here and i'll
16:19 - share our project management board
16:22 - and so peop you can really get an
16:24 - over-the-shoulder look
16:25 - whereas i think on social media and on
16:28 - youtube
16:28 - i'm going to be sharing maybe end of
16:30 - week updates in the video
16:32 - and i'm going to be sharing maybe
16:34 - youtube stories
16:36 - instagram stories and stuff like that on
16:38 - things as they happen throughout the
16:39 - week
16:40 - short clips like that um in either case
16:43 - even if you're not a member of cwc plus
16:45 - you will be able to follow along on this
16:47 - three month app journey
16:49 - and then at the end of three months
16:51 - whether we succeed
16:53 - or fail i think it's gonna be an amazing
16:55 - learning
16:56 - experience for all of us obviously i do
16:59 - hope that we're succeed
17:01 - and i'm gonna try my best because it's
17:04 - going to be an amazing case study if we
17:06 - pull it off and
17:07 - if it goes on to become a full-fledged
17:10 - business it's going to be amazing
17:12 - but even if it's not like i said it's
17:13 - going to be an amazing learning
17:14 - experience
17:16 - so that's what's been going on behind
17:18 - the scenes for the past couple of months
17:20 - i know this isn't the usual type of
17:22 - video that you see on this channel but i
17:23 - hope you enjoyed it nonetheless
17:26 - if you're interested in checking out the
17:27 - thinkific platform and this new learning

Cleaned transcript:

hey code crew what's up it's chris here i hope you've all had a wonderful holiday season and i know i don't do these talking type of videos very often usually it's a tutorial but i wanted to take this opportunity to tell you about some of the things that i've been working on behind the scenes and now most of these things are launched or in progress and i'm really excited to share with you there are actually three things number one is cwc 3.0 or that's just what i call it but essentially it's a website revamp it's a little more than that and i'm really proud of how it turned out i want to walk you through this new experience and number two is the swift ui foundations course this course is in progress it continues off from the 14 day beginner challenge and i want to share what i've been doing in that number three is probably what i'm most excited about and it is an app case study that is currently underway and we just started this week my idea with this is to share behind the scenes and have you guys if you're interested to follow along with that journey as we try to build an app and turn it into a business i think it's going to be very interesting and i'll also share with you my motivations for doing this yeah i won't say too much right now but i'll save that for last all right let's hop on the computer so i can show you all right so let's first talk about the website revamp and it's more than just a style difference we actually migrated learning platforms from teachable to thinkific so we were using teachable before and this is what it looked like we've been using this for very many years it got to a point where we finally decided to change because we kept seeing the same complaints from our users over and over number one was that when they signed up for teachable teachable always prompted them to create a my teachable account or to link up this account to their my teachable account and it just confused the heck out of people to the point where a bunch of people even didn't want to continue after that because of how confusing that signup process was and these are our paying customers right who are signing up to cwc plus second thing is that the way that the courses are laid out doesn't really reflect our app journey that we always talk about there's different stages in the learning process and different courses associated with each step so this grid of courses a lot of people got confused about where to start especially once we started introducing swift ui content as well so people were confused do they start with this or they start with this and yeah i i will give them that it is very confusing so we finally decided to migrate to uh thinkific and this is what it looks like now the thing i like about thinkific is that everything is very customizable you're able to through code and through liquid templates customize every single aspect of the experience and so we decided to make the experience seamless so that it doesn't feel like you're going to another site from codewithchris.com and you can see this is when you're inside and you're on the learning platform and it still feels you know like the same site it was nowhere near the level of customization with teachable so with uh thinkific i'm able to depending on the role of the user uh give them a customized welcome video so whether they are a cbwc plus member or maybe they're just checking out our free courses i'm able to have some quick links up here and then i'm able to more importantly lay out the courses the way i want now this is all custom coding this doesn't come out of the box but i'm able to lay it out so p it's very clear where people start and then what they're supposed to do next and then after they finish the apprentice level courses where what they're supposed to do next from there and this is sort of like a mix and match explore um what interests you at this stage and then finally getting to the pro courses where um you're trying to meet your goals whether that's look for a job or to build a product so we were able to migrate to thinkific and at the same time i decided that with our forum that's running on discourse right now to also use a single signon with our wordpress site so the experience is going to be creating or signing into codewithchris.com and then you're automatically going to be signed into our form and right now that's not the case because we haven't actually performed that that link yet and they'll also be signed into the thinkific instance so i'm going to style the header here by the time you see this video that gets released this will probably be styled and then this will be linked up to the code with chris accounts but it's going to be a sort of unified experience so i'm really proud that we finally got this launched because i've been looking at this since october and i started going like way way out of scope because i started reimagining everything uh i was dabbling around and and trying to redesign our logo and redesign the home page and redesign the the layout of our blog posts and quickly sort of got out of hand and you know i'll talk about the logo a little bit because i feel like that's a little interesting from the get go our logo as you can see um here it's it's hard to read there's some text that's illegible like the width over there it's also hard to put in a circular format as you can see in this tab up here it doesn't really look good in circular format and also as a watermark it's it does also doesn't really work i really love this logo though because it's our first original like og logo so i'm gonna still pay homage to that with this new logo but this one is a little more modern and it's way easier to work with so that's what we ended up going with and i'm going to leave the restyling of the home page and a whole bunch of other pages on our site that i wanted to modify i'll leave that for later anyway so that's the website revamp that is just finishing up next i want to talk about the courses that i'm currently working on inside cwc plus so i just gave myself access to everything and as you can see the welcome video is different for someone who logs in as a cwc plus member this sort of customization wouldn't have been available through teachable so again it's very clear where you start you start here and then you come down here and you're taking these apprentice level courses from foundations to databases to design now foundations continues off where the 14 day beginner challenge leaves off and if i go into this course i just want to tell you a little bit more about what i'm working on the reason why this is actually so interesting to me is because we've had this sort of three course learning path since the beginning and we did it with ui kit here and you know people really had a great experience with this but we've had this for many years and we've basically updated it as apple has come up with new versions of swift and xcode but it wasn't until doing the swift ui version that i was able to completely change it up right reimagine it from the ground up and i was able to incorporate so much feedback from um from the students and from users like yourself so for example some of the things that were improved a lot of people said it was very hard to after they finished the course to refer back to content if they forgot something so we took this opportunity to create topic indexes for lessons so this is really going to help with that in terms of using the course as reference after you've completed it the other thing is that inside the course i noticed that after people finished the course and they were uh going to create their own personal projects that a lot of people were just losing code forgetting where they put it or making a change and breaking their project and not being able to go back and that sort of thing and i realized how crucial of a topic source control is even if you're not working in a team and it's for your personal projects and so i've decided to incorporate that into the foundations course just showing you at a bare minimum how to set up your private repos and how to um commit and push your code even for just your personal projects another thing is that the learning experience from from talking with the students a lot of the learning comes from the actual um doing of the work and that comes to no surprise but sometimes people if not if they don't if they aren't given the opportunity to to practice and do the work then it's less likely that they will on their own right i always said after you watch the lesson you should try it out on your own and i don't think that was enough so in the old ui kit version of the courses i would have some quizzes i would have some exercises scattered throughout the course and people responded really well to that they wanted more of it and so in this version of the course i've made an effort to create a quiz and create challenges for every single lesson and it's not long you know it's not tough but it does give people an opportunity and a reason to make sure that they have the concepts they need to know before they move on and another thing that this helps with is the marketability of the course for classrooms and for you know educational institutes because we tried working with schools with our ui kit courses and we realized that if you want it to be an actual curriculum in a school there has to be a lot more handson work and can't just be like a series of videos that people watch passively and so we had set out to create all of that material after the fact and it was a lot harder to do whereas right now i am creating these quizzes and challenges as we go along and you know the quiz like i said isn't long but i think one of the the main aspects that's good about thinkific is and i don't know why this doesn't exist in teachable but when you answer a quiz question it gives you an opportunity to write a message telling people like why that's right or why that's wrong uh and also giving them like maybe a little summary about why that's the right answer in teachable it's either right or wrong and you don't have the opportunity as an educator to write anything else so i i really like this and i don't know if that's right or wrong because i'm not reading the question but yeah i really like this so i made an effort to fill out sort of an explanation for every single question and the challenges aren't long right but it gives an opportunity for people to to test something out so in short what i'm working on right now modules one two and three are done and released modules four five and six are in development and half of the database course is done and none of the design course is done so if we go back here for a second behind the scenes when i'm not recording and producing youtube tutorials this is what i'm working on um yeah and most of these courses here are are finished now all of them are finished or content is coming out for them um gradually next i want to talk about the app case study which is down here at the pro level but before i do that i want to talk about the motivation for these pro stage courses and what they're all about now when i was reimagining you know code with chris for 2021 i i was really asking myself um you know sort of what why why code with chris right why uh and i think there are so many choices out there especially for you know paid programs or paid courses and stuff like that and i identified the i identified that i wanted to help people get a result so i didn't just want to teach them how to code or show them you know swift ui i wanted to help them reach their goal whatever that might be and make a transformation so when we talked with our students and we talked about talked with members of our audience um the two things the two themes that stood out were a career right so that's freelancer consultant or job as an ios developer and be wanting to build their own app or to build a business or surrounding an app so i wanted to shape this path this app journey as we like to call it as you can come in here having no coding experience right starting right here and if you've taken the 14 day beginner challenge or you've seen these videos on youtube you'll know that it really starts with no coding experience needed so you pick up those skills you expand on those skills based on your interests or what you need for your app or looking for job and then when you get to this stage it's material to help you with either of those two goals now in terms of the career oriented stuff we're going to work on that after the building and app business stuff so this product framework in this three month app case study is really the goal is to help people build their own app or build their own app business so that's the motivation between these two things now in terms of what they are our product framework these are the steps we're going to follow to build a successful app and then the case study is real time we're doing this right now we just started this week is an overtheshoulder look at us attempting to build a successful app business and the reason i'm so excited for this is because this is new territory for me you see in my previous job we built apps for clients and success for us meant that we delivered an app to them on spec on time and on budget and after that whatever happens we weren't accountable for those results but in terms of building a successful app or a successful app business you have to be invested in what happens after you launch the app in fact most of the action happens after you launch the app so that is all new to me so this product framework is really our best guess at this point based on what we know and we're gonna update and iterate on this framework as we prove it out by applying it through this threemonth ab case study our goal in three months is to follow these phases that i've outlined in here and launch an app and get our first customer so we're going to try and do that in three months and based on what happens in here we'll probably be updating and proving or disproving our assumptions in the framework now the reason i bring this up is because the threemonth case study is something that i want anybody to be able to follow along and even though this is part of the cwc plus program i think in here i'm going to share um you know maybe more finer details about what's happening so for example what i have right now since this just started this week um i'm documenting the meetings that we're having the decisions we're making uh what we talked about and so it's very detailed information um you know technical feasibility questions we're asking how we're going to go about answering them action items uh what we're doing from here and i'll share our project management board and so peop you can really get an overtheshoulder look whereas i think on social media and on youtube i'm going to be sharing maybe end of week updates in the video and i'm going to be sharing maybe youtube stories instagram stories and stuff like that on things as they happen throughout the week short clips like that um in either case even if you're not a member of cwc plus you will be able to follow along on this three month app journey and then at the end of three months whether we succeed or fail i think it's gonna be an amazing learning experience for all of us obviously i do hope that we're succeed and i'm gonna try my best because it's going to be an amazing case study if we pull it off and if it goes on to become a fullfledged business it's going to be amazing but even if it's not like i said it's going to be an amazing learning experience so that's what's been going on behind the scenes for the past couple of months i know this isn't the usual type of video that you see on this channel but i hope you enjoyed it nonetheless if you're interested in checking out the thinkific platform and this new learning experience you can simply go to codewithkris.com and click on the try for free link in the upper right corner and create an account and then you'll be into the thinkif dashboard and you can check out all our free courses other than that look forward to the first episode of our three month app case study here on youtube and with that said thanks for watching and i'll catch you guys next time bye for now
