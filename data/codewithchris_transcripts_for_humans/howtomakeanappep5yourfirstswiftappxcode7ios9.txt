00:04 - hey guys welcome to lesson 5 of how to
00:07 - make iphone apps with no programming
00:09 - experience and in this lesson we are
00:13 - going to start our first Xcode project
00:15 - and build our first app so if you've
00:18 - been following along you should have
00:19 - Xcode installed already and when you
00:22 - open up Xcode you're going to see a
00:24 - welcome dialogue like this and we're
00:26 - just going to select this option create
00:29 - a new Xcode project if you don't see
00:31 - this dialog you can go up here to file
00:33 - new and project so it'll do the same
00:36 - thing so we're just going to create a
00:39 - new Xcode project so the first dialog
00:44 - that you see will be one for choosing a
00:46 - template for your new project the first
00:48 - thing you want to do if you don't see
00:50 - any of these templates is make sure that
00:52 - you're in the application section under
00:54 - iOS here on the left hand side and you
00:57 - should see these different templates
00:58 - available to you now we're going to
01:00 - start with the most basic one which is
01:02 - just gives you a single blank view for
01:05 - your project depending on what type of
01:07 - project we wanted to build for example
01:09 - if we wanted to build an app with tabs
01:12 - along the bottom we could choose this
01:14 - template as a starting point likewise if
01:17 - we were building a page based one or a
01:19 - master-detail type of app these may be
01:21 - better starting points now that's not to
01:24 - say that we can't get to these other
01:27 - templates by choosing this one it's just
01:30 - a better starting point you know we
01:32 - could still add a tab bar for our single
01:34 - view application we could still add page
01:37 - based navigation to our single view it
01:39 - just depends which one is the best
01:41 - starting point for your app so we're
01:43 - going to select single view application
01:44 - and we're going to click Next
01:46 - so we're going to go through these
01:48 - settings together and you want to pay
01:50 - attention to some of these settings
01:52 - because it may alter what you see in the
01:54 - next view so for product name that's
01:56 - just what our app is going to be named
01:59 - and I'm just going to type in hello
02:01 - world here so your organization name is
02:05 - something that you you can put anything
02:08 - in here it could be your personal name
02:10 - it could be your company's name and as
02:13 - for your
02:13 - organization identifier it's going to be
02:15 - used in conjunction with your product
02:17 - name to create a unique bundle or app
02:20 - identifier so normally what people put
02:23 - is com dot and then either their name or
02:26 - company name and then it would follow
02:28 - the system where it would be com dot
02:30 - their company name dot their app name
02:33 - now the next two are important so for
02:37 - the language we're going to be going
02:39 - through Swift so you want to make sure
02:41 - you're selecting Swift for this language
02:42 - here and for devices we're only talking
02:46 - about iPhone at this point so select the
02:48 - iPhone and you'll want to make sure that
02:51 - use core data is unchecked so we're not
02:54 - going to go through that topic today
02:56 - click Next you can save it anywhere I'm
03:02 - gonna save it on my desktop you want to
03:04 - make sure before you click create there
03:06 - that this source control checkbox is
03:09 - unchecked as well and source control is
03:12 - a way of storing and managing your code
03:14 - tracking your changes as you progress in
03:17 - your project but we won't be using it
03:20 - today here in this demo and it may be a
03:22 - topic that we cover in the future so I'm
03:25 - just going to click create okay so let's
03:31 - go through some of the files in your new
03:33 - project so at the very very top the root
03:36 - node is your project properties so when
03:39 - you click this on the editor area over
03:42 - here you're going to see all of your
03:44 - project configuration settings and we'll
03:47 - be definitely using this area in the
03:49 - future moving on we have the app
03:53 - delegate so the app delegate provides a
03:56 - chance for you to type in some code or
03:59 - logic where you can handle different
04:02 - situations that arise in the lifetime of
04:05 - your application for example if you read
04:07 - some of these here application did enter
04:09 - enter the background or will come back
04:12 - and enter the foreground or to become
04:14 - active or will terminate so it gives you
04:17 - a chance you can write code here to
04:20 - maybe save that data or restore some
04:23 - data or restore the last place Lill
04:27 - view the user was using it gives you a
04:30 - chance to do something at different
04:32 - points in the applications lifetime then
04:35 - second thing is the view controller so
04:37 - we went over this in the model view
04:40 - controller or MVC design pattern in the
04:42 - last lesson so this view controller
04:45 - manages the view now we get to the main
04:49 - dot storyboard and when you click this
04:51 - your editor area turns into interface
04:54 - builder so now you see the view for your
04:57 - single view application and this is the
05:00 - view controller that manages this view
05:02 - now what is the storyboard so the
05:05 - storyboard manages the flow of your
05:07 - application in a visual manner you see
05:10 - this arrow right here well this arrow
05:13 - represents the starting point or the
05:15 - entry point of your application and
05:17 - right now it's pointing to this view
05:18 - which is managed by this view controller
05:21 - right here it is possible when we build
05:24 - some more complex apps that we will have
05:27 - multiple views and multiple view
05:29 - controllers and this arrow will indicate
05:32 - you know what the starting point is now
05:35 - here are some tips to navigate the
05:37 - storyboard you can double-click the area
05:40 - to kind of zoom out or you can
05:44 - right-click and you can pick a zoom
05:46 - level you could double click and zoom
05:48 - back in okay moving on we have our image
05:54 - asset library and in here this is where
05:57 - we're going to add image assets to our
05:59 - project and you can literally just
06:02 - create a new image set and drag and drop
06:05 - our assets in here and then we can refer
06:07 - to them by their name that we give it
06:10 - here
06:10 - in our code to access the image asset so
06:13 - we're going to do this in our demo
06:16 - projects in module 2 and lastly we have
06:20 - this launch screen zib and this is
06:23 - another interface builder file and this
06:25 - just represents the the startup screen
06:28 - for our app ok so first thing we're
06:31 - going to do is go back to main dot
06:33 - storyboard and we're going to do our
06:36 - hello world demo application now if
06:39 - you've ever done any
06:41 - their programming education before you
06:42 - may recognize that HelloWorld is kind of
06:45 - the customary first app or first program
06:48 - so that's what we're gonna do here iOS
06:51 - style now we're looking at main
06:53 - storyboard and in our editor we see our
06:56 - view here so what we're going to do is
06:59 - visually add a label to the view and
07:02 - just change the text of the label to say
07:05 - hello world and then we're gonna run our
07:07 - application first thing you will want to
07:10 - do in the lower right hand corner if you
07:12 - remember this is called the library pane
07:14 - and if you don't see these elements that
07:17 - you know I have here make sure that
07:19 - you're on this tab because there are a
07:22 - couple of different tabs you can be on
07:24 - here and don't worry if it doesn't look
07:27 - like a list because there's another
07:29 - button here to change the view yours
07:31 - could look like this just a grid of grid
07:34 - of elements or a listing of elements so
07:38 - in this search box you can kind of
07:40 - filter through the library and I'm going
07:43 - to type in label and I'm just going to
07:47 - click this and drag it in the center now
07:51 - at this point we can change the text of
07:53 - the label so I'm just going to double
07:55 - click it and I'm going to type in hello
07:59 - world
08:02 - next we're actually going to just run
08:04 - our app and watch it in the simulator so
08:07 - up here in the upper left hand corner
08:09 - make sure that you've selected a
08:13 - simulator
08:13 - so I'm mines on iPhone 6 and I'm just
08:16 - gonna hit run I'm gonna compile your
08:19 - application and then it's gonna launch
08:21 - the iOS simulator okay so it's launching
08:27 - its loading our app so you'll notice
08:31 - that we see the label in our view but
08:33 - it's kind of not in the center it's off
08:36 - to the side
08:37 - well what happened because we actually
08:39 - had our label in the center here so I'm
08:41 - gonna stop the running of our
08:44 - application
08:48 - now if you had trouble running your
08:51 - application or you had some error pop up
08:53 - one thing that I would try is hit the
08:56 - simulator here and then there's an
08:59 - option to reset it it's just to reset
09:01 - all of the content and settings if you
09:03 - go up to the menu here it's gonna ask
09:06 - you are you really sure you want to
09:07 - reset it and you hit reset and it's
09:10 - gonna reset it to its original default
09:13 - blank slate state and then you can try
09:18 - running it again okay but now let's look
09:21 - at the issue of the label positioning so
09:24 - the reason that the label is
09:26 - off-centered is because iOS uses a
09:28 - system called auto layout to determine
09:30 - where the element should sit and auto
09:33 - layout describes the position of the
09:36 - element based on something called
09:37 - constraints and we're going to take a
09:40 - look at that now so click your label and
09:43 - then down here in the lower right hand
09:46 - corner you're going to see this icon
09:50 - which says align so I'm gonna hit that
09:53 - and we're going to add to alignment
09:57 - constraints so I'm gonna check that
09:59 - horizontal Center in the container and
10:02 - vertical Center in the container and
10:04 - we're gonna click this button add these
10:05 - two constraints okay so once I did that
10:09 - you'll notice that this trigger or this
10:12 - line shows you the constraints for our
10:14 - element which is in the center and
10:16 - you'll notice here in this pane on the
10:19 - left you can open this and you can see
10:23 - that there are two constraints for this
10:25 - label and if you don't see this pane
10:27 - it's this button right here that will
10:31 - open and close that now if I run it
10:34 - again you'll see that the label is
10:36 - actually in the center because it's
10:39 - going to when it displays that label
10:41 - it's going to read those constraints and
10:44 - it's going to based on those constraints
10:47 - vertically and horizontally Center that
10:50 - element and the reason that this is good
10:54 - rather than positioning exactly where we
10:58 - put it the reason why I ought Oh layout
11:00 - is good is because it were
11:01 - the same way on any screen right or you
11:05 - can just hold down command and press
11:07 - left or right so there you have it
11:11 - congratulations you've created your
11:13 - first simple app in the next lesson
11:16 - we're going to start module 2 and we're
11:17 - going to start looking at creating more
11:19 - complex apps where you'll have to write
11:21 - Swift code

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to lesson 5 of how to make iphone apps with no programming experience and in this lesson we are going to start our first Xcode project and build our first app so if you've been following along you should have Xcode installed already and when you open up Xcode you're going to see a welcome dialogue like this and we're just going to select this option create a new Xcode project if you don't see this dialog you can go up here to file new and project so it'll do the same thing so we're just going to create a new Xcode project so the first dialog that you see will be one for choosing a template for your new project the first thing you want to do if you don't see any of these templates is make sure that you're in the application section under iOS here on the left hand side and you should see these different templates available to you now we're going to start with the most basic one which is just gives you a single blank view for your project depending on what type of project we wanted to build for example if we wanted to build an app with tabs along the bottom we could choose this template as a starting point likewise if we were building a page based one or a masterdetail type of app these may be better starting points now that's not to say that we can't get to these other templates by choosing this one it's just a better starting point you know we could still add a tab bar for our single view application we could still add page based navigation to our single view it just depends which one is the best starting point for your app so we're going to select single view application and we're going to click Next so we're going to go through these settings together and you want to pay attention to some of these settings because it may alter what you see in the next view so for product name that's just what our app is going to be named and I'm just going to type in hello world here so your organization name is something that you you can put anything in here it could be your personal name it could be your company's name and as for your organization identifier it's going to be used in conjunction with your product name to create a unique bundle or app identifier so normally what people put is com dot and then either their name or company name and then it would follow the system where it would be com dot their company name dot their app name now the next two are important so for the language we're going to be going through Swift so you want to make sure you're selecting Swift for this language here and for devices we're only talking about iPhone at this point so select the iPhone and you'll want to make sure that use core data is unchecked so we're not going to go through that topic today click Next you can save it anywhere I'm gonna save it on my desktop you want to make sure before you click create there that this source control checkbox is unchecked as well and source control is a way of storing and managing your code tracking your changes as you progress in your project but we won't be using it today here in this demo and it may be a topic that we cover in the future so I'm just going to click create okay so let's go through some of the files in your new project so at the very very top the root node is your project properties so when you click this on the editor area over here you're going to see all of your project configuration settings and we'll be definitely using this area in the future moving on we have the app delegate so the app delegate provides a chance for you to type in some code or logic where you can handle different situations that arise in the lifetime of your application for example if you read some of these here application did enter enter the background or will come back and enter the foreground or to become active or will terminate so it gives you a chance you can write code here to maybe save that data or restore some data or restore the last place Lill view the user was using it gives you a chance to do something at different points in the applications lifetime then second thing is the view controller so we went over this in the model view controller or MVC design pattern in the last lesson so this view controller manages the view now we get to the main dot storyboard and when you click this your editor area turns into interface builder so now you see the view for your single view application and this is the view controller that manages this view now what is the storyboard so the storyboard manages the flow of your application in a visual manner you see this arrow right here well this arrow represents the starting point or the entry point of your application and right now it's pointing to this view which is managed by this view controller right here it is possible when we build some more complex apps that we will have multiple views and multiple view controllers and this arrow will indicate you know what the starting point is now here are some tips to navigate the storyboard you can doubleclick the area to kind of zoom out or you can rightclick and you can pick a zoom level you could double click and zoom back in okay moving on we have our image asset library and in here this is where we're going to add image assets to our project and you can literally just create a new image set and drag and drop our assets in here and then we can refer to them by their name that we give it here in our code to access the image asset so we're going to do this in our demo projects in module 2 and lastly we have this launch screen zib and this is another interface builder file and this just represents the the startup screen for our app ok so first thing we're going to do is go back to main dot storyboard and we're going to do our hello world demo application now if you've ever done any their programming education before you may recognize that HelloWorld is kind of the customary first app or first program so that's

is in the center and you'll notice here in this pane on the left you can open this and you can see that there are two constraints for this label and if you don't see this pane it's this button right here that will open and close that now if I run it again you'll see that the label is actually in the center because it's going to when it displays that label it's going to read those constraints and it's going to based on those constraints vertically and horizontally Center that element and the reason that this is good rather than positioning exactly where we put it the reason why I ought Oh layout is good is because it were the same way on any screen right or you can just hold down command and press left or right so there you have it congratulations you've created your first simple app in the next lesson we're going to start module 2 and we're going to start looking at creating more complex apps where you'll have to write Swift code
