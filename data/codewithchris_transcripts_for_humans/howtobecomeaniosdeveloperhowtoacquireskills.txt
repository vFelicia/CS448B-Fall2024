With timestamps:

00:00 - in the last video we mapped out the skills 
that you need for two different goals number  
00:03 - one becoming an iOS Developer to find a job and 
number two becoming an iOS Developer to build  
00:09 - your own apps I even made a downloadable PDF for 
you with the skill trees now we need to talk about  
00:15 - finding the right resources to learn these skills 
so where do you find the proper learning resources  
00:21 - well the answer has two parts number one where 
do you find the learning resources this is the  
00:26 - easy part number two and this is the hard part how 
do you judge if it's right for you and for this I  
00:33 - have seven criteria to look for but before we dive 
into that let's cover the easy part first where  
00:39 - do you find these resources and this depends on 
what is the best mode of learning for you if you  
00:45 - like inperson learning look for some in-person 
classes or an in-person course in your city if  
00:50 - you like reading search on Google for your topic 
or go to the library if you like video search on  
00:56 - YouTube now if you're doing in-person learning 
I'm sure the quality is going to be there and  
01:01 - the training is going to be up to dat and more 
importantly the concepts taught are going to be  
01:06 - taught in the right order and progression so that 
you build up your skills same thing with a book  
01:11 - The only thing I'd check is the publication date 
because technology changes so fast you'll want  
01:16 - to make sure the book was published within the 
last 12 months ideally now if instead you found  
01:21 - an article on Google or a video on YouTube then 
I'd suggest running through the following seven  
01:26 - criteria number one is it for beginners if you 
are a beginner then I would recommend that you  
01:32 - search for an article or video that has the term 
for beginners starting from scratch or something  
01:38 - like that the reason is because these learning 
resources will focus on using less technical  
01:43 - jargon and explain things at a slower Pace 
number two what does the resource cover if it's  
01:49 - your first time learning about a topic then your 
goal should be to find a resource that gives you  
01:53 - an overview of the topic before deep diving into 
anything specific for example if you're learning  
01:59 - xcode and you find an article on all the features 
and things that you can do with the editor area  
02:04 - that's not very helpful if you don't even know 
what the editor area is ideally you're looking  
02:10 - for an overview of xcode before even getting into 
the details number three is it up todate or is it  
02:17 - still relevant it's extremely tough to learn from 
an outdated resource because as you're trying to  
02:23 - follow along you're going to hit Road bumps and 
you may not be able to follow along at all and  
02:29 - this just adds to the frustration of learning 
so how do you determine if the resource is up  
02:35 - to date first of all you need to find out what is 
the latest version of xcode or Swift or whatever  
02:41 - the topic is that you're trying to learn and that 
can be done with a quick Google search number two  
02:46 - does the resource have some sort of indication 
about what version it's compatible for if not  
02:53 - then you may want to consider leaving a comment 
or checking the comments or messaging the author  
02:58 - to see if there's any information you can find 
out you can ask the author does this resource  
03:04 - still work for this latest version of that topic 
now one thing to keep in mind is that things may  
03:10 - not have changed that much in the latest version 
compared to the previous version so a good quality  
03:16 - Learning Resource may still be a great resource 
for you to learn on for this I would check the  
03:22 - comments of the article or video and see if 
people are still using this to learn today  
03:27 - number four is it a series now this is is a bonus 
I love the series format because it breaks down a  
03:34 - bigger topic into bite-sized lessons and what's 
more is that each lesson can build upon the last  
03:40 - and it allows the student or the viewer to feel 
progression in skills now again this is a bonus  
03:47 - if your Learning Resource is broken up into a 
series of Articles or videos but it's not an  
03:51 - absolute requirement number five does it have a 
table of contents again this is a bonus and it's  
03:57 - very easy and quick to see if there is a table 
of contents that means that the author has given  
04:04 - some thought into the order in which the ideas 
should be presented in and I think that is an  
04:11 - easy way to tell if it's a quality resource or 
not it is not a red flag if it's missing again  
04:17 - it's just a bonus if it is there number six does 
it have some steps to follow along or something to  
04:24 - practice on so for example if there are steps that 
you can see in the learning resource then that is  
04:30 - something that you can try to replicate on your 
own computer uh and try to follow along and this  
04:36 - is super duper important because I don't know 
how long you've been following but my story in  
04:42 - learning iOS is that I failed for the first time 
simply because I did not do enough practicing as  
04:47 - I was learning I read a book from cover to cover 
thought I knew everything I understood everything  
04:52 - but when I sat down to try to build an app I 
realized that I didn't know how to start and I  
04:58 - kind of had to start all over over in my learning 
process so that's why I highly recommend that you  
05:04 - follow along and practice and make this a very 
big component of your Learning Journey and this  
05:10 - leads me to my seventh criteria which is more 
of a learning tip for you actually and that is  
05:17 - to let your practice guide you in your learning 
what do I mean by that it means that when you  
05:23 - find a Learning Resource treat it as a starting 
point all right follow along and practice it as  
05:29 - you practice practice the beautiful thing is that 
questions will come up you're going to discover  
05:34 - what you don't know and you're going to have 
questions pop up in your head what about this  
05:38 - what about that that the Learning Resource may 
not have covered so let those questions guide you  
05:45 - in searching for the answers to those questions 
that is a great way to explore and learn a topic  
05:52 - I guess another way to phrase this tip is that 
the Learning Resource that you initially find  
05:58 - it doesn't need to be super comprehensive 
and cover everything about that topic in  
06:03 - fact it might be kind of hard to find a Learning 
Resource that does that um you'll probably take  
06:09 - several learning resources to fully cover the 
topic and the important thing is that you find  
06:16 - a good starting point right you start practicing 
it so that you generate those questions and you  
06:23 - generate and you find out what you don't know 
and then you let those questions guide you in  
06:28 - searching for answers right and um that is also 
a very practical way to learn so when we create  
06:35 - training material here at code with Chris our 
video courses or series we always try to keep  
06:40 - these things in mind even this how to become an 
iOS Developer series that you're watching right  
06:44 - now is an example of that these days there are so 
many different learning resources out there that  
06:50 - are completely free if you really want to achieve 
your goal the only thing standing in front of you  
06:56 - is yourself and putting in some hard work so so 
remember from the first video in this series the  
07:02 - 20h hour rule so go ahead use these tips to find 
a Learning Resource judge if it's the right one  
07:08 - for you and pencil in 2 1hour sessions into your 
calendar before you know it you'll get the ball  
07:14 - rolling you'll start making progress and things 
will start looking very very positive now in the  
07:19 - next step in this series of how to become an iOS 
Developer I'm going to tell you how you can judge  
07:25 - when you are ready to start applying for jobs 
building your own app and and what are the steps  
07:30 - that you can prepare to ensure success all right 
thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

in the last video we mapped out the skills that you need for two different goals number one becoming an iOS Developer to find a job and number two becoming an iOS Developer to build your own apps I even made a downloadable PDF for you with the skill trees now we need to talk about finding the right resources to learn these skills so where do you find the proper learning resources well the answer has two parts number one where do you find the learning resources this is the easy part number two and this is the hard part how do you judge if it's right for you and for this I have seven criteria
