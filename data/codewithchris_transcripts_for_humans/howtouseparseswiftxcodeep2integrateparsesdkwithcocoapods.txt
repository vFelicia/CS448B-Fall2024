00:02 - hey coders Kris here yesterday you sign
00:05 - up for a parse account today we're going
00:07 - to create an Xcode project and we're
00:09 - going to integrate the parse SDK into it
00:12 - in future lessons we're going to use
00:13 - this project to demonstrate all of the
00:15 - various features of parse so if you sign
00:17 - up for parse account you should have
00:19 - this dashboard view right here and
00:21 - you're going to want to go to create a
00:23 - new app in the upper right hand corner
00:24 - so click this button you're gonna have
00:27 - to pick a name for it because we're just
00:29 - doing demos I'm just gonna say parse
00:32 - demo and click make it and before we go
00:35 - into all of these things on the
00:37 - left-hand side I want you to go into app
00:39 - settings and go under security and keys
00:41 - this is where you're going to find a
00:43 - couple of the keys that we're going to
00:44 - need in order for our app or our project
00:48 - to connect to this back-end all right so
00:51 - we're gonna come back to this but what I
00:53 - want you to do now is there in the new
00:55 - dashboard there are a couple of dots
00:56 - down here you can see where my mouse is
00:58 - click it and you're gonna have a pop up
01:00 - menu go to downloads and we're gonna
01:03 - download the parse SDK so in the past we
01:06 - used to have to download the SDK and
01:08 - then manually include it into our
01:10 - project but now they have an open-source
01:13 - github library where we can actually use
01:16 - a cocoa pod install so we've been doing
01:19 - this in the past mmm
01:21 - two weeks ago approximately I showed you
01:23 - guys how to use cocoa pods and how to
01:24 - install a whole bunch of github
01:26 - libraries using this method and so we're
01:28 - gonna do the same thing because using
01:29 - cocoa pods has the benefit of managing
01:32 - the parse library if it updates we're
01:34 - gonna be able to easily update it as
01:36 - well okay so let's create that Xcode
01:39 - project we were talking about so I'm
01:42 - gonna create a new Xcode project here
01:45 - and I'm gonna make this a single view
01:47 - application and let's call it the parse
01:50 - demo app make sure that the language is
01:54 - Swift and I have device as iPhone and
01:57 - all of these other options underneath it
01:59 - unchecked
02:00 - I'm gonna click Next I'm just gonna save
02:02 - it on my desktop here and here we've got
02:04 - our single view application I'm gonna go
02:07 - ahead and close this guy and I'm gonna
02:09 - press command spacebar and open up
02:12 - terminal
02:13 - now if you don't know what cocoapods is
02:15 - or you haven't gotten it installed then
02:17 - take a look at the video linked in the
02:19 - upper right hand corner right now click
02:21 - through it I'll open up a new window and
02:23 - I'll show you how easy it is to setup
02:25 - cocoapods and then you're going to be
02:26 - able to come back to this video and
02:28 - continue along so here we're going to
02:31 - navigate to our project folder so I'm
02:34 - gonna type in PWD to see where I am I'm
02:38 - at user slash Chris and I know there's a
02:41 - desktop folder in the Chris folder so
02:43 - I'm gonna type CD space desktop you type
02:45 - LS that lists all of the files on the
02:49 - desktop or in that current folder I mean
02:52 - so type in now CD parse demo app because
02:55 - I see that folder right here on my
02:58 - desktop make sure you get the
02:59 - capitalization correct okay so now I am
03:03 - in my project folder so I'm gonna type
03:05 - pod space in it and that's gonna create
03:08 - the pod file that I need so let's there
03:10 - we go let's open up our project folder
03:14 - here's the pod file I'm going a little
03:16 - bit quickly because we've actually done
03:18 - this a lot of times in previous videos
03:20 - while we installed I think ten different
03:22 - libraries or maybe a little less than
03:24 - that but right-click the pod file go to
03:27 - open with go to your text editor I'm
03:30 - gonna go to subline sublime text - which
03:34 - is my text editor and then we're gonna
03:36 - need to uncomment a couple of lines here
03:39 - this one and this one right here so make
03:43 - sure you have this platform line
03:44 - uncommented and use frameworks and
03:47 - uncommenting means just removing that
03:49 - hash symbol in front of it and then next
03:52 - we're going to want to include this pod
03:56 - parse in between the target and the end
03:59 - tags like that save the file go back to
04:03 - terminal
04:05 - and let's type in pod space install so
04:09 - it's gonna go read that pod file and
04:11 - fetch the libraries which we need takes
04:14 - a little while sometimes so give it a
04:16 - little bit of time I might just edit out
04:18 - that wait time so you guys don't have to
04:20 - wait okay so it's done now we're gonna
04:25 - go back to our project folder it created
04:27 - a couple of new files for us we're gonna
04:30 - open up this parse demo dot XC workspace
04:33 - and let me just change this xcode window
04:36 - so you can see it so we've got our demo
04:39 - app here just press command b to build
04:41 - the project now so it's gonna build all
04:43 - those libraries that it downloaded so
04:46 - you can see Xcode doing that crunching
04:48 - right now and while that's doing that
04:50 - let's go back let's press back in our
04:52 - browser window okay build succeeded back
04:56 - here in the downloads page click launch
04:59 - the QuickStart is there a couple of
05:01 - instructions that we're gonna need so go
05:03 - to data go to mobile go to iOS go to
05:08 - Swift go to new project okay so here it
05:12 - recommends you actually to download the
05:14 - blank Xcode project because it's done it
05:16 - all for you already but you know what we
05:19 - don't want to do that because we've set
05:20 - up our own Xcode project we've
05:23 - integrated the parse library now and now
05:25 - it's a matter of adding a couple of
05:27 - lines of code and specifying the secret
05:30 - key and the app key in order for our our
05:34 - Xcode project to connect to the back end
05:36 - up here in the upper right if you're
05:37 - signed in you're going to see a
05:39 - drop-down where you can pick the
05:41 - particular parse app that you created in
05:44 - the dashboard so here it's already set
05:47 - it to sample parse app for me actually
05:49 - no I want parts demo that's the one I
05:51 - created this is this is something else
05:53 - so parse demo is the one that we wanted
05:56 - so make sure that if you only have one
05:58 - it's easy but if you have a couple make
06:00 - sure you have the right one selected
06:01 - because it's gonna change the code here
06:03 - and it's gonna fill in these keys for
06:05 - you okay so now I'm gonna copy and paste
06:07 - this line of code let's just copy it
06:10 - let's see we put it in the app delegate
06:13 - that Swift file under the did finish
06:15 - launching with options let's go into the
06:17 - app delegate that Swift
06:19 - and under here before the return
06:21 - statement because if you put it after
06:22 - return statement it won't get run
06:24 - nothing happens after a return statement
06:27 - because it returns out of that function
06:30 - so paste it there actually I'm missing a
06:32 - P so I might have to import parse so
06:37 - import parse and there we go command B
06:42 - build it build succeeded and we're set
06:47 - now we haven't tested if it actually
06:49 - connects to the back end in the
06:50 - following lesson we're going to try to
06:52 - retrieve say some data and we should be
06:55 - able to tell so thanks for watching and
06:57 - please help me out by liking the video
06:59 - subscribing and sharing it with your
07:01 - friends thank you so much and I'll see
07:03 - you guys tomorrow bye
