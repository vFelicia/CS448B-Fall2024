00:00 - hello Chris here in this video I just
00:03 - want to quickly tell you about a change
00:04 - in xcode 8.1 regarding update frames a
00:08 - lot of people are watching my beginner
00:10 - series and some other videos and I show
00:13 - things like adding an element onto the
00:15 - storyboard and then adding some Auto
00:18 - layout constraints to that element and
00:21 - then going to a menu here where I'm
00:24 - choosing update frames and what that
00:26 - does is it positions that element
00:28 - according to the new autol layout
00:31 - constraints that you've added well
00:33 - they've moved that uh menu option out of
00:36 - this menu in xcode 8.1 and they've
00:39 - actually put it as a button here update
00:41 - frames which makes it a lot more
00:43 - convenient for us so all you need to do
00:45 - now is click this button to update
00:48 - frames so that's just a quick note for
00:50 - you guys who are scratching your heads
00:52 - and wondering uh why you don't see that
00:54 - menu option in your xcode so thanks
00:57 - again for learning with me and I'll see
00:59 - you guys in the next one bye for now
