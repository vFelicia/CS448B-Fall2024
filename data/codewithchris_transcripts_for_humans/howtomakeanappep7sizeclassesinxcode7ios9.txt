00:05 - hey guys welcome to lesson seven of how
00:08 - to make iphone apps with no programming
00:09 - experience in the previous lesson we
00:12 - learned how to add an element
00:14 - specifically an image view to the
00:17 - storyboard and also how to position it
00:20 - and how to size it with Auto layout
00:22 - constraints and this is the result that
00:25 - we got the app is running in the
00:27 - simulator in portrait view it's
00:29 - vertically centered and it's 50 points
00:32 - from the left edge and if I go into
00:34 - landscape view it's also vertically
00:37 - centered and it's also 50 points from
00:40 - the left edge now I'm not particularly
00:42 - happy about this because while I think
00:45 - it's perfect in portrait view you see
00:48 - there's just enough space for two cards
00:50 - in landscape view I feel like if the
00:53 - other card was 50 points from the right
00:55 - edge there'd be too much white space in
00:58 - the center so in landscape view I
01:00 - actually want the card this card in
01:03 - particular to be closer to the center I
01:05 - want a bigger margin from the left edge
01:08 - so what can I do about that well that's
01:11 - where size classes comes into play so
01:14 - let's go back into Xcode and I'm going
01:16 - to stop my project here and in the
01:21 - storyboard of your project down here
01:23 - you'll notice WN e and H n E and that
01:27 - stands for any width and any height if
01:29 - you click that you're gonna get this
01:32 - little pop-up where you can change your
01:34 - size class that you're looking at see
01:37 - and there's a little description about
01:39 - what that size class is what this allows
01:42 - you to do is to add elements and
01:44 - constraints to only a specific size
01:47 - class now by default we are in the any
01:50 - width and any height size class so any
01:53 - elements that we add on to the
01:55 - storyboard or constraints that we add to
01:58 - the storyboard in this size class
02:00 - applies to any screen size so whether
02:03 - that's landscape portrait iPad iPad
02:05 - portrait iPad landscape it's going to
02:08 - use the same set of elements and the
02:09 - same set of rules to position and to
02:11 - size them now I mentioned
02:13 - that in portrait I wanted this
02:17 - constraint right here see the 50-point
02:20 - constraint here I thought this was
02:23 - perfect in the iPhone portrait but in
02:25 - landscape I wanted this to be a greater
02:27 - margin so what I can do instead is right
02:32 - now I'm in the any with any height size
02:33 - class I'm going to delete this
02:35 - constraint so let's go ahead you can
02:38 - delete it from here on the document
02:39 - outline and instead I'm gonna change
02:43 - size classes to go into the iPhone
02:46 - portrait so let's drag this around and
02:49 - see what we've got here this is for all
02:53 - I phones in portrait that sounds exactly
02:56 - like what I need so I'm going to choose
02:57 - that and then I'm going to add that
03:01 - fifty point constraint margin here and
03:04 - then after that I'm going to change the
03:06 - size class to the landscape one and I'm
03:09 - going to add another constraint that is
03:11 - specific for landscape orientations and
03:14 - make that margin bigger so the one I'm
03:16 - adding right now is to the compact with
03:19 - regular height size class which is only
03:22 - for portrait so I'm going to click image
03:24 - view I'm gonna go into here this is the
03:29 - pin menu I'm going to uncheck constrain
03:32 - mark to margins I'm going to highlight
03:35 - that left margin I'm gonna say 50/50 is
03:38 - good make sure you click out of it press
03:42 - tab and then you can see that it's 50
03:45 - with this enabled add one constraint so
03:49 - there we go now if I switch size classes
03:52 - to this one for all compact height
03:58 - layouts iPhones and landscape so this is
04:01 - what I need for landscape you can see
04:03 - that it's it says it's missing a
04:06 - horizontal constraint and then you can
04:08 - see the constraint that we just added is
04:10 - greyed out here in the document outline
04:12 - because this constraint we only added to
04:14 - the portrait size class for iPhones so
04:17 - now I'm going to add another one and
04:19 - click the image view I'm going to
04:23 - uncheck constrain to margins
04:26 - enable that left margin and this time
04:28 - I'm going to say I'm gonna say a hundred
04:33 - and let's add that constraint and as you
04:37 - can see there's a little warning there
04:41 - that what I'm seeing here is not
04:43 - reflective of what the rules are so I'm
04:45 - gonna highlight my image view click
04:47 - resolve click resolve auto layout issues
04:50 - which is this little icon here and
04:52 - update frames for all views in my view
04:54 - controller so now you can see that in
04:57 - landscape view it's going to have a
05:00 - hundred point margin from the left edge
05:03 - so now let's go back to any width in any
05:07 - height now you can see that both of
05:10 - these are disabled or grayed out because
05:15 - I added those specifically to the
05:19 - portrait size class and this one to the
05:21 - landscape size class but let's run it
05:24 - now in our simulator to see what we get
05:29 - okay so this is portrait right here
05:33 - which is that fifty point margin from
05:35 - the left now if I go into landscape you
05:38 - can see that there's a greater margin
05:40 - it's a hundred now let me change back to
05:42 - portrait you see that and landscape it's
05:46 - still actually a little too far away so
05:48 - I'm gonna try and try 150 instead so I'm
05:53 - gonna highlight this one and I'm gonna
05:57 - go here and change that 100 to 150 and
06:02 - now while we're here take a look at this
06:05 - down here for my constraint I can see
06:08 - where it is installed so there's a
06:11 - checkmark next to any width and compact
06:14 - height and this is the landscape size
06:17 - class if I wanted to install this
06:20 - constraint also to the size class which
06:24 - I'm currently looking at which is any
06:26 - within any height I can simply also
06:29 - check that and then now you can see that
06:33 - it is enabled in this any within any
06:37 - height size class
06:38 - and I can uncheck it like that okay so
06:42 - let me run it again and there you go so
06:49 - that looks a bit better
06:51 - that's landscape and that's portrait

hey guys welcome to lesson seven of how to make iphone apps with no programming experience in the previous lesson we learned how to add an element specifically an image view to the storyboard and also how to position it and how to size it with Auto layout constraints and this is the result that we got the app is running in the simulator in portrait view it's vertically centered and it's 50 points from the left edge and if I go into landscape view it's also vertically centered and it's also 50 points from the left edge now I'm not particularly happy about this because while I think it's perfect in portrait view you see there's just enough space for two cards in landscape view I feel like if the other card was 50 points from the right edge there'd be too much white space in the center so in
