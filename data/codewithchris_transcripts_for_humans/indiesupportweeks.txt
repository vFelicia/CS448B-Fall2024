00:00 - hey code crew it's Chris here so a lot
00:02 - has happened in the past week I hope
00:04 - you're all safe and I hope your families
00:07 - are safe and healthy as well as for my
00:09 - family and I we're just stuck at home so
00:11 - you should still see new tutorials
00:13 - coming on this channel but having said
00:16 - that I feel so fortunate and blessed to
00:18 - be operating in the online space because
00:21 - I can still do stuff I can't imagine how
00:24 - hard it is if you're unable to work
00:26 - during this time and unable to provide
00:28 - for your family
00:29 - and I think the worst part is that
00:31 - there's no clear indication of when
00:33 - we'll resume our normal lives and what
00:35 - that new normal might look like one of
00:38 - the groups of people that I'm trying to
00:39 - help are indie developers who rely on
00:42 - the App Store to feed their families
00:44 - from what I've seen and heard many indie
00:47 - developers have suffered big drops
00:49 - in-app revenue so in the coming weeks
00:52 - I'm going to be showcasing some of these
00:54 - apps from these indie developers if you
00:57 - think the app is cool and you're
00:58 - financially in a good spot then please
01:00 - consider showing some support this
01:02 - initiative was actually started by
01:04 - Johnson Dell and I'll provide the link
01:05 - to the page in the description below so
01:08 - if you yourself are an indie developer
01:10 - in need then definitely visit that page
01:13 - and add your name to the list that's all
01:15 - for now stay tuned for some new content
01:17 - on the channel
01:18 - and again I hope you are all safe and
01:21 - healthy and I'll see you guys in the
01:23 - next video
