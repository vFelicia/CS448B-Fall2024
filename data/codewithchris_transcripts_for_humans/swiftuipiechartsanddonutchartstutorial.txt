With timestamps:

00:00 - in the previous video you'll learn about the 
different types of Swift UI charts but there  
00:03 - was one particular chart that was missing the pie 
chart it's newly introduced and it's available in  
00:09 - iOS 17. let's take a look at how we use it it's 
important to mention that pie charts and donut  
00:14 - charts are only available in iOS 17 or later which 
means that we have to use xcode 15 or later as of  
00:20 - the time of this recording xcode 15 is in beta so 
that's what we're using today this is the previous  
00:27 - charts demo that we did in our last video and here 
we showed how to do different types of charts like  
00:34 - bar charts and line charts and all those things 
that are currently already available we're going  
00:39 - to be using this project because I mean the sample 
data is already there so in case you didn't see  
00:45 - that last video Let's briefly go over what the 
sample data is so it's a sample sleep data and  
00:52 - each sleep data point consists of a day number 
of hours and the type of sleep it was and then  
00:59 - inside the content view just to make things very 
simple and easy we just declared a static array  
01:04 - here of sample data points so we might have you 
know Monday six hours and then Mondays two hours  
01:11 - again for a nap Tuesday Wednesday Thursday 
Friday we have three Friday data points for  
01:17 - nap and accidental sleep and then Saturday and 
Sunday seven hours each okay so now let's go  
01:23 - ahead and put this sample data into a pie chart 
step one you have to import the charts framework  
01:29 - at the top so here you can see that we've already 
done that step two go down to the view area where  
01:36 - you're going to put your view code and create a 
new chart view which is also what we've already  
01:42 - done so I'm going to go ahead and remove some of 
this code just to make things a little more clear  
01:50 - and yeah let me just remove all of this for now  
01:56 - okay and then I am going to comment the bar Mark 
out okay so this is the chart view right it has  
02:05 - an opening bracket and a closing bracket inside 
the chart view we are going to use a four each to  
02:12 - Loop through the data this is that sample sleep 
data that I just showed you above here and for  
02:18 - each data point we are going to decide how we 
want to display that data point so as you saw  
02:25 - in the previous chart tutorial and earlier before 
I commented this out the type of chart that gets  
02:30 - shown all depends on what type of Mark you want 
to use so there's bar Mark line Mark and you know  
02:36 - all those types of marks that we went through in 
the previous video but to display your data in a  
02:41 - pie chart we use what's called a sector Mark so 
let's go ahead and create a new sector Mark here
02:51 - so you'll notice that the only required parameter 
that you need is angle back here in bar Mark and  
02:59 - actually a lot of the other marks you have to 
specify in X and A Y because most of those charts  
03:03 - have an X and A Y axis right whereas the pie chart 
only has like each slice of the pie represents one  
03:12 - dimension of data so that's why you only have to 
specify the angle these other parameters we will  
03:17 - go through later on in this lesson these are just 
optional ways to customize uh the how the chart  
03:24 - looks so let's go ahead and start the sector Mark 
and use the angle parameter now the type of data  
03:34 - is a plottable value okay so this this is exactly 
the same as these right here these are plottable  
03:42 - values so with a plottable value you have to 
specify the label and the value so let's go ahead  
03:51 - and do that now the label I am going to make each 
slice of the pie chart represent how many hours  
04:00 - of sleep and the overall chart the entire pie 
chart represents how much sleep I got that week  
04:07 - so let's call this hours and the value would be 
D and I'm going to make the slice of the pie the  
04:18 - hours right and it's all one color right now but 
we will update that real soon now what's important  
04:24 - to note here is that I don't actually have to 
calculate the angle I just have to say this is the  
04:32 - data that I want to represent with the pi slice 
and it will calculate how big that Pi slice should  
04:40 - be depending on the total amount of hours and how 
many hours this particular data point represents  
04:47 - so all of that is done automatically so in order 
to clearly see the slices let's add a foreground  
04:53 - style to the sector Mark I'm going to use this 
one foreground Style by it's like how do we want  
05:00 - to differentiate the different slices how do we 
want to color them so again it's by plottable  
05:05 - value and I want to customize it by day so that 
I can clearly see which day I got the most sleep
05:14 - so D dot day you'll see that we automatically 
get a legend and let's just put some padding on  
05:22 - the chart right now so it looks a little nicer 
all right there we go so we have the seven pie  
05:31 - charts representing the hours of sleep that I got 
on each day Wednesday looks to have been the best  
05:39 - I can get rid of this Barb Mark now and 
essentially that's how easy it is to create  
05:44 - a pie chart but there are some customizations 
that we can do to it for starters let's add  
05:50 - some lines in between each of the pi segments so 
this is where those other parameters come into  
05:57 - play let me just adjust the preview so we can see 
the code a little better perfect okay so another  
06:05 - parameter if you remember was uh angular inset 
so this one is just a number so if I put one  
06:15 - you can see that it breaks everything up 
by one point or perhaps I could put five  
06:20 - if you want like a huge break we'll put one it 
looks pretty good uh the other thing that you  
06:25 - saw is what's called oops added a comma in the 
wrong place it's called an inner radius and this  
06:34 - represents a circle in the middle of the pie 
chart an empty space where you can turn this  
06:41 - pie chart into a donut chart so let's take a look 
at that the data type is Mark dimension all right  
06:47 - so let's just hit Dot and there are a couple of 
methods that we can use to very easily create  
06:53 - one depending on how we want to specify this 
empty space in the middle so fixed would just be
07:01 - a fixed number oh I have to put a comma oops there 
we go so 40 would just put an empty circle with um  
07:12 - the diameter of 40 60 and so on and so forth what 
you might want to do instead is to use a ratio  
07:22 - because a ratio let's say you know I want 
the circle in the middle to be 50 percent  
07:28 - or maybe ninety percent something like that right  
07:33 - but this is how you would create a donut chart 
one last customization I want to leave you with  
07:37 - is Corner radius so you apply this out here and 
you can make your Pi segments have rounded Corners  
07:47 - now that's an exaggeration what I've done here 
it actually looks like so pudgy but you can just  
07:55 - make it more slightly rounded with the corner 
radius modifier pie charts are so useful and  
08:02 - I'm really glad they made it easy to use and 
easy to add to your view now next week we're  
08:07 - going to go back to basics and we're going to show 
how to use a variety of Swift UI components with  
08:11 - the goal of building up a reference library on 
this channel that you can access whenever you're  
08:16 - wondering how to use a particular component in 
the meantime if you're new to Swift UI checkout  
08:21 - our three hour Master Class no experience required 
meant for beginners by the end of it you'll have  
08:26 - built your first app all right thanks for 
watching and I'll see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

let's take a look at how we use it it's important to mention that pie charts and donut charts are only available in iOS 17 or later which means that we have to use xcode 15 or later as of the time of
