00:05 - hello in this video I have a very
00:08 - helpful Xcode tip to share with you guys
00:10 - and that's how to reset Xcode and reset
00:13 - the simulator so why do we want to do
00:15 - that well sometimes when you run your
00:18 - project and it doesn't connect to the
00:20 - simulator it's giving you some error or
00:23 - maybe your app doesn't run at all did
00:26 - you know that it could be a bug in Xcode
00:29 - or an error in Xcode and not necessarily
00:31 - your programming or your code or your
00:35 - storyboard so it's really quick to do
00:38 - and it's worth a try when you're running
00:39 - into problems anyways so to reset the
00:42 - simulator you have it in your foreground
00:44 - go up to this iOS simulator menu go to
00:48 - reset content and settings and then when
00:52 - it asks you just hit reset and what that
00:55 - does is it resets the similar to the
00:58 - original state okay so it takes a while
01:02 - to do that but usually after that
01:04 - finishes I just quit Xcode quit the
01:07 - simulator and kind of restart everything
01:09 - another way to reset your project is go
01:14 - up to the product menu here and select
01:17 - clean and what that does is it cleans
01:21 - out all of the built assets and code
01:24 - from your project the last time you ran
01:27 - it because the because Xcode will only
01:31 - recompile your code if it's changed or
01:34 - only the bits that have changed so
01:36 - sometimes if you want to start from a
01:38 - absolute clean slate then go to product
01:42 - and then clean here and finally one last
01:45 - thing that you can do is go up to window
01:48 - in the Xcode menu and go to projects and
01:53 - you can reset or delete rather the
01:56 - derived data for your project on the
01:58 - left-hand side here you can select which
02:00 - project and you know this is the one
02:02 - that I've got open here and then select
02:04 - delete derived data and what this is is
02:06 - it indexes all of your files and you
02:10 - know this output down here that stuff is
02:13 - all
02:13 - the logs and everything you can just
02:15 - delete it clear it and the next time
02:18 - it's going to rebuild it see it's
02:20 - already there right
02:23 - you can close Xcode and then you can
02:25 - start it again and so those are three
02:27 - ways for you to reset Xcode and reset
02:32 - your simulator and that might just do
02:35 - the trick if it's an xcode related error
02:37 - and not your code so I hope that was
02:40 - helpful for you guys and I'll see you
02:42 - guys in the next video
