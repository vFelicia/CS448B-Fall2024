With timestamps:

00:21 - hello hey it's chris here last week 
apple presented a bunch of new updates  
00:26 - for their ios ipad os watch os and mac os 
platforms in their annual wwdc presentation  
00:33 - now after that they did another presentation 
for developers called the platform state of  
00:37 - the union where they shared a lot of updates for 
xcode swift swift ui and new apis for developers  
00:45 - now in this video i'm not going to go through 
all of those things because i wrote them all up  
00:49 - in a blog post anyways link in the description 
but what i do want to share with you are the  
00:53 - three big themes that jumped out at me as i was 
watching these presentations and what i think it  
00:59 - will mean for you and your app development in 
the near future okay so theme number one apple  
01:04 - announced that you can have widgets and glanceable 
information right on the lock screen not only that  
01:10 - these widgets can display live data such as for 
sports games or workouts or the progress of your  
01:17 - ride share even they also announced a new app 
intense framework that your app can implement  
01:23 - so that your app's functionality can be surfaced 
at the os level and be exposed to features like  
01:29 - siri shortcuts app spotlight search and so on now 
to me all of this points to an app experience that  
01:37 - is freed from the traditional sense of the user 
having to launch your app in order to use it  
01:43 - with widgets the user can look at your app's 
data on the lock screen or the home screen  
01:47 - and with app intents the user can use your app's 
functionality through siri and shortcuts and more  
01:52 - so i think the fact of the matter is if you're 
not leveraging these frameworks and you're still  
01:56 - relying on the user to manually launch your 
app in order to use it i think you're going  
02:00 - to be missing out big time especially with how 
many apps are on a user's device these days  
02:05 - okay on to the next big theme apple also announced 
a lot of new improvements to swift ui including  
02:11 - native chart components better management of app 
navigation more flexibility and options for laying  
02:17 - out your components in your views and also easier 
ways to integrate swift ui into an existing ui kit  
02:24 - project now some of these things have been a thorn 
in our site for a long time now such as with app  
02:30 - navigation and swift ui we were limited to kind 
of the standard basic types of navigation and if  
02:37 - we wanted to do anything more complex it was a 
real struggle but what these announcements show  
02:43 - me and really there's no surprise here is that 
apple is really trying to get us all to join the  
02:50 - swift ui bus so to say this is the direction that 
they're headed in and i've always said in the past  
02:57 - don't fight against it just go with the flow swift 
ui is maturing it's gonna get to that point where  
03:03 - you want to start your project in swift 
ui now let's face it ui kit still provides  
03:08 - way more control and flexibility in terms of app 
development but i still feel that for someone who  
03:14 - is new and someone who is just picking up 
app development swift ui is still the way  
03:18 - to go because it's a much more joyful learning 
experience and you're less likely to give up  
03:24 - and really when you're starting out and starting 
to learn that is the most important thing not  
03:28 - giving up just getting past that hump getting to 
the point where you want to do it more and you see  
03:34 - progress right so swift ui is perfect for that so 
if you're an existing app developer what does this  
03:39 - mean for you well i think that you should consider 
when you're starting a new project basing it on  
03:44 - swift ui and integrating ui kit into it that 
way your project will be more future proof as  
03:50 - apple continues to refine and improve swift ui 
so the recap theme number two is apple pushing  
03:56 - the migration and adoption of silk ui okay now 
onto the third big theme which is cross-platform  
04:02 - shared code base i'm not talking about 
cross-platform such as android versus ios but  
04:08 - more so across apple's other platforms like ipad 
mac and on the watch and even apple tv in the two  
04:16 - presentations apple also announced improvements 
to swift and the xcode tooling to make it easier  
04:22 - for us to build apps that work seamlessly across 
all their platforms in their presentation they  
04:27 - showed how easy it was to add an additional target 
for another platform in your xcode project there  
04:34 - are also improvements to swift ui preview to allow 
you to easily see how your ui would look on a  
04:40 - different platform and also variations in that 
platform such as for your watch where you have  
04:47 - different color sets that you can cycle through 
and things like that swift ui already adapts  
04:52 - nicely to different screen sizes and now with 
additional options and flexibility with new types  
04:58 - of layout components that we can use it makes it 
even easier to layout your ui for different screen  
05:05 - sizes and if you need to you can write blocks 
of code and condition statements where certain  
05:10 - pieces of code or functionality will only run on 
specific platforms now i can see why apple wants  
05:16 - us to build apps on all of their platforms as i'm 
sure the non-ios app stores probably need a boost  
05:24 - but as developers we have to consider the impact 
on launching an app on multiple platforms as well  
05:30 - yes you can get more eyeballs for your app however 
that also means more complexity when it comes to  
05:36 - support right imagine getting bug reports on 
all the platforms and not just on one platform  
05:43 - if you're a single person team or a small team 
with limited resources i would carefully consider  
05:50 - uh which platforms you launch your app to focus 
on the platforms that make the most sense for the  
05:55 - use case of your app in some cases for example 
a food tracker app perhaps having an apple watch  
06:02 - experience really adds to the general use case 
of tracking food makes it a lot more convenient  
06:07 - for people right so in that case it might 
make sense to build an apple watch experience  
06:13 - in addition to the ios core app so the third 
big theme is apple pushing multi-platform so  
06:20 - these were the three biggest themes that jumped 
out to me as i watched the wwdc presentation  
06:25 - and the platform state of the union was it 
the same for you or did you notice something  
06:28 - else let me know in the comments below what 
announcement you're the most excited about  
06:33 - and by the way if you want to read the notes 
that i wrote up on both of these presentations  
06:37 - check out my blog article right over there thanks 
for watching and i'll see you in the next video
07:00 - foreign
