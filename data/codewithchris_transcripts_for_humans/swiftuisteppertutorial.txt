00:00 - hey it's Chris and in this tutorial I'll show 
you how to add a stepper to your Swift UI  
00:04 - project now a stepper control allows the 
user to easily increment and decrement a  
00:09 - value just like you see on the screen now all 
right so let's dive in and see how it's used  
00:13 - before we begin one quick note we have a free 
xco project containing sample code for all of  
00:18 - the Swift UI components use it for your own 
projects or just to learn from get it at CWC  
00:25 - swiftui dkit all right so here I have an empty 
xcode project so let's start by declaring our  
00:32 - stepper and there are a lot of different uh 
different initializers you can use so let's  
00:38 - use one of the most basic ones where you 
have a piece of text let's say Quantity and  
00:45 - you bind it to a value that you can increment 
and decrement so here let's declare that state
00:52 - property and so I'll just default this 
to an integer zero and here we're going  
01:00 - to create a binding to quantity and just 
like that we have a stepper control with  
01:06 - the label that we specified which you 
can increment and decrement the thing  
01:10 - is we can't see the value right so in 
order to read the value you can just  
01:15 - read the property here and we can embed it 
into this label by substituting it in like
01:23 - that so now we can see the value right there 
but notice I can go into the negative territory  
01:31 - and that doesn't really make sense in this 
context so if you wanted to restrict it to  
01:36 - a certain range you could do that as well all 
we need to do is add another parameter to our  
01:42 - stepper initialization called in and I'm going to 
restrict it from 0 to 10 and this will make it so  
01:49 - that when I reach zero I can't go any lower 
and when I reach 10 I can't go any higher now  
01:58 - another thing I want to show you how to do is 
to increment or decrement by a certain amount  
02:04 - so this is called the step value so let's say I 
wanted the step value to be two well we can add  
02:10 - another parameter at the end called step and 
let's put it to two now whenever I increment  
02:17 - or decrement it's always by two so that's how 
easy it is to use the stepper in your project  
02:22 - if you want to download the sample code for 
this we've got it all in a single handy xcode  
02:27 - project in fact it contains a sample code for 
all of the Swift UI components so that you can  
02:31 - learn from it or copy and paste the code 
into your own project just visit cc. Swift  
02:38 - ui- kit it's a free download I'll leave 
it in the description below the video too
