00:04 - hello welcome to the code with Chris Q&A
00:07 - where I'll take a couple of minutes to
00:09 - answer questions that you guys have so
00:12 - for today I have a question that I
00:14 - commonly get from people who are looking
00:15 - to get started in building apps and that
00:18 - question is can I use a PC or do I need
00:21 - a Mac to build apps and let me just put
00:26 - this into context because I teach how to
00:28 - build iPhone and iPad apps so the answer
00:32 - is yes you do need a map if you want to
00:34 - use the Apple supported tools basically
00:38 - the tools that Apple has provided for us
00:40 - developers to build their iOS apps
00:42 - however there are third-party tools and
00:46 - third-party solutions that can be used
00:49 - on the PC to build iOS apps so for the
00:53 - rest of this short segment I just want
00:55 - to go through some of those options and
00:56 - pros and cons before we get into that
00:59 - another kind of related question that I
01:02 - get sometimes is can I use an iPad to
01:05 - build apps for the iPhone or iPad and
01:08 - the answer is no because the tools that
01:10 - apple provides us it's called Xcode it's
01:13 - the application where we actually write
01:15 - our code in to build those apps that
01:17 - application is only available on the Mac
01:20 - on OSX to be specific so you can only
01:23 - install and use it if you have a Mac
01:25 - computer okay so that's the get an apple
01:28 - supported tool now onto the PC solutions
01:32 - one of the things which I've seen people
01:35 - do is to virtualize the OSX platform on
01:39 - their PC so they're having a virtual Mac
01:41 - running on their PC so it can get a
01:44 - little technical and how to set that up
01:46 - so I'll leave it up to you guys to look
01:48 - into that
01:48 - so that's virtualization another
01:51 - solution is that you can rent a Mac
01:53 - remotely so there are services like Mac
01:56 - and cloud comm where you can pay a
01:59 - monthly fee and you can remotely log
02:02 - into one of their Macs and you can use
02:05 - it for app development in fact on their
02:07 - site I believe that this is one of the
02:09 - the main features that they promote and
02:13 - lastly
02:13 - another set of solutions are all of
02:16 - these cross-platform tools that are
02:19 - available on the PC so some of them are
02:22 - AB cellar ater PhoneGap unity xamarin
02:26 - all of these tools that are available on
02:29 - the pc these development environments
02:32 - are designed for you to be able to write
02:35 - your code and build your app once but
02:37 - then be able to deploy and deploy it's
02:39 - just a fancy word for export into an app
02:44 - these tools allow you to code your at
02:47 - once and then deploy it onto multiple
02:49 - platforms and that's why they're called
02:51 - cross-platform tools now you might be
02:55 - thinking right off the bat that this
02:56 - sounds good this is exactly what you
02:58 - want to use but as with anything where
03:01 - there are alternatives there's
03:02 - definitely pros and cons so the pro
03:06 - obviously is that you can write your
03:08 - code once and you can deploy to multiple
03:09 - platforms however because they aren't
03:13 - Apple supported and basically they're
03:15 - taking your code and translating it to
03:17 - use the Apple software development kit
03:19 - and hit those device api's or device
03:23 - interfaces it's not perfect so if Apple
03:27 - releases a brand new feature tomorrow
03:28 - and they release it they release support
03:32 - for it on their support a tool on their
03:34 - official tool called Xcode and they you
03:38 - know they update to iOS 9 or whatever
03:40 - the iOS is at when you listen to this
03:43 - the other cross-platform tools will have
03:45 - to kind of play catch-up there will be a
03:47 - little bit of time where they are
03:50 - retooling to provide support for these
03:53 - new features and the other thing is that
03:56 - there may be bugs because at the end of
03:59 - the day it's a translation that's not
04:00 - perfect so on many of these
04:02 - cross-platform tools you may encounter
04:05 - bugs which you otherwise would not have
04:07 - encountered if you are using the Apple
04:10 - the official Apple tools to build apps
04:12 - and furthermore there may be some
04:14 - features that are totally unsupported in
04:17 - these cross-platform tools I've only
04:19 - listed a handful of these cross-platform
04:22 - tools but maybe in the future I'll do
04:24 - another segment where I
04:26 - more in-depth into these PC solutions if
04:29 - you guys are interested my focus and
04:32 - experience has been with Xcode the the
04:36 - tools that apple provides us so I can't
04:40 - comment too much about the other tools
04:42 - which I have mentioned I can't compare
04:44 - them too much until I do some research
04:46 - and look into them myself but the
04:48 - lessons that I teach in the courses
04:49 - which I provide on my site they are with
04:52 - the Apple provided tools so if you want
04:55 - to build a iPhone and iPad apps using
04:58 - the Apple tools then this is the place
04:59 - to be so thanks for tuning in and I'll
05:02 - see you guys next time
05:03 - bye for now
