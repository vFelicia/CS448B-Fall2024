00:00 - hey code crew in this video I'll reveal
00:02 - my thoughts on what the top 5
00:04 - programming languages for mobile apps
00:06 - are now just to burst your bubble right
00:08 - away there is no universal top language
00:11 - and that's because it largely depends on
00:12 - what your goals are are you looking for
00:14 - a job are you looking to build a app for
00:17 - a specific platform or are you trying to
00:20 - keep your options as open as possible
00:21 - all of these are factors to consider and
00:24 - we're gonna break it down in a variety
00:27 - of different angles in this upcoming
00:29 - list alright stay tuned hey there my
00:36 - name is Chris and if this is your first
00:38 - time here welcome to code with Chris
00:39 - where we'll teach you how to build an
00:41 - app even if you've never coded before
00:43 - before I revealed my list I want to pose
00:45 - a question to you what do you think is
00:47 - the best programming language for
00:49 - building mobile apps let me know by
00:51 - leaving a quick comment below and on
00:53 - your way down there if you wouldn't mind
00:54 - please hit the thumbs up button and
00:56 - subscribe if you haven't already I
00:58 - really appreciate that alright let's get
01:00 - started with number five and number five
01:04 - we have dart for building cross-platform
01:07 - native mobile apps using flutter a quick
01:10 - note if this is your first time hearing
01:11 - the term cross-platform it means that
01:14 - you can write a single codebase and
01:15 - deploy your app on multiple platforms
01:17 - such as iOS and Android awesome in
01:21 - theory but not so smooth sailing in
01:23 - practice now before we get too far off
01:25 - topic I'm not here to debate whether or
01:27 - not flutter is a good mobile
01:29 - cross-platform framework the topic of
01:32 - this video is to evaluate and rank
01:34 - programming languages so let's take a
01:36 - look at dart and what it's good for and
01:38 - what may be not so good about it
01:40 - dart is a relatively new programming
01:42 - language developed by Google described
01:44 - as a client optimised language for
01:47 - building fast apps you can build apps on
01:49 - mobile on desktop and even for back-end
01:52 - so what are some pros and cons of Dart
01:54 - there are multiple ways to use dart for
01:57 - example dart comes with a dart virtual
01:59 - machine which allows computers to
02:01 - execute dart code or you can convert
02:03 - your dart code to JavaScript and use it
02:05 - wherever you can use javascript or you
02:07 - can compile your dart code to native
02:09 - code for running on Android and iOS you
02:11 - get the idea it's pretty versatile
02:13 - Pro number two it's designed to be fast
02:16 - in fact I've read that dart code which
02:18 - is converted to JavaScript can actually
02:20 - run faster than handwritten JavaScript
02:23 - if you're wondering how this can be it's
02:25 - because when your handwriting or hand
02:27 - typing JavaScript you follow common
02:29 - patterns and structures of the language
02:31 - whereas when the code is being converted
02:32 - from dart to JavaScript the dart2js
02:35 - compiler can make a lot of optimizations
02:38 - and shortcuts sacrificing the legibility
02:40 - and clarity of hen written code for
02:42 - speed and performance instead is it sad
02:46 - that a machine can write better code
02:47 - than a human developer can alright so
02:50 - what's not so great about dart well my
02:53 - biggest gripe about dart is that
02:55 - although it seems like a really cool
02:57 - language it doesn't seem like the first
02:59 - language I would choose to learn
03:00 - especially when it comes to some of the
03:02 - other languages that you're going to see
03:04 - in the rest of this video if you're in
03:06 - the boat where you're short on time and
03:08 - you have to choose only one programming
03:10 - language to invest your time into
03:12 - learning then there are a ton of other
03:15 - more popular languages out there
03:17 - that will give you a better return on
03:19 - investment especially from the angle of
03:21 - keeping your options open and finding
03:24 - jobs and now this brings us to language
03:26 - number four at number four we have HTML
03:31 - CSS and JavaScript for building mobile
03:34 - apps using PhoneGap okay first of all I
03:36 - realize that I just need three things
03:38 - and also if you want to get really
03:40 - technical with me technically
03:42 - HTML and CSS aren't programming
03:45 - languages but in my opinion for someone
03:52 - who is non-technical or someone who just
03:54 - wants to get into the coding world for
03:55 - the first time I think HTML and CSS are
03:58 - great - gateway languages to learn to
04:01 - get your feet wet and kind of make your
04:04 - way into that technical world the reason
04:06 - is because learning HTML usually leads
04:08 - to learning CSS and JavaScript because
04:10 - they all play so nicely together and
04:13 - before you know it you're going to be
04:14 - full-on into web development all right
04:17 - back to PhoneGap PhoneGap now owned by
04:19 - adobe allows you to build cross-platform
04:21 - apps using HTML CSS and JavaScript the
04:25 - apps are essentially rendered in web
04:26 - views which may not look like or perform
04:29 - as well as apps that are written
04:31 - natively for this specific platform that
04:33 - they're targeting for example using
04:35 - swift for iOS or using Kotlin for
04:37 - Android now I'm not a huge fan of
04:39 - PhoneGap but the reason its number four
04:42 - here in my list is because HTML CSS and
04:45 - JavaScript are great languages to know
04:47 - how to use anything web related like
04:49 - websites or web applications you'll come
04:51 - across HTML CSS and JavaScript now the
04:55 - biggest Pro in terms of learning these
04:57 - technologies is that they are so widely
04:59 - used that these skills will be
05:01 - applicable for other uses as well not
05:04 - just building mobile apps Pro number two
05:06 - it's easy to pick up I think HTML and
05:09 - CSS are great and simple languages to
05:12 - start learning for someone who is not
05:14 - technical or hasn't coded before it's
05:16 - simple fun and engaging and you can
05:18 - start to see results right away even
05:20 - with knowing just a few HTML tags and
05:23 - now what's not so good about learning
05:25 - these skills for mobile app development
05:27 - if your goal is to build a mobile app
05:30 - then these skills might not be the best
05:32 - fit because I don't believe that
05:34 - PhoneGap is the best solution for
05:36 - building cross-platform mobile apps it
05:39 - might work for some people if those are
05:42 - the skills that you've already had it
05:44 - might be a easy way to get your foot in
05:46 - the door to building mobile apps but if
05:48 - you're starting fresh and your goal is
05:50 - for building mobile apps then I think
05:51 - some of the other solutions on my list
05:53 - are going to be better suited before we
05:56 - get into number three I just want to say
05:57 - that today's video is sponsored by
05:59 - Atlantic dotnet Atlantic net provides
06:02 - great VPS hosting and they are offering
06:04 - a free one gig virtual server with SSDs
06:07 - free block storage and free snapshots
06:09 - for an entire year in addition to that
06:12 - get $25 and free credits to use on any
06:15 - other services they offer try Atlanta
06:18 - net to develop test or launch your next
06:21 - project ease of use is something that I
06:23 - like as it frees up my mind to focus on
06:25 - coding I also like that they have
06:27 - round-the-clock phone support so if I
06:28 - happen to get stuck I can contact them
06:30 - easily so visit Atlantic dotnet slash
06:33 - code with Chris and enter the code Chris

06:41 - don't forget to use the coupon code
06:42 - Chris to get your $25 free credit which
06:45 - is an exclusive offer to you guys now
06:48 - back to our list at number three we have
06:53 - JavaScript for building cross-platform
06:55 - mobile apps with react native yes we're
06:58 - still talking about cross-platform apps
07:00 - single codebase deployed on multiple
07:02 - platforms well what makes PhoneGap sit
07:05 - on number four on our list and react
07:07 - native sit on number three well they
07:09 - both use popular widely used programming
07:12 - languages PhoneGap with HTML CSS and
07:14 - javascript and react native with
07:17 - javascript and they're both
07:19 - cross-platform technologies but this is
07:21 - where we need to make a distinction with
07:24 - react native and flutter you use
07:25 - JavaScript and dart respectively to code
07:28 - once and then that code gets translated
07:30 - into code that is native to the platform
07:32 - it's getting deployed to this makes sure
07:34 - that the resulting app is fast and
07:36 - performs like an app written with a
07:38 - native language would with PhoneGap
07:40 - however you're essentially just building
07:43 - in html5 web app that gets displayed
07:45 - through a webview on whatever platform
07:47 - you're deploying to so yeah react native
07:51 - wins over PhoneGap they're in my opinion
07:53 - so what's good and what's not so good
07:55 - about react native one of the biggest
07:57 - benefits of react native over PhoneGap
07:59 - and flutter is that you're working with
08:01 - JavaScript one of the most popular
08:03 - programming languages out there even if
08:05 - you decide not to pursue building mobile
08:07 - apps anymore you can still use
08:09 - JavaScript for tons of other things like
08:11 - web apps and server-side code Pro number
08:14 - two working with a popular programming
08:17 - language also means that there's a lot
08:19 - of support in a huge library of reusable
08:22 - code modules and packages in terms of
08:24 - what's not so good from what I've read
08:26 - and heard building cross-platform apps
08:28 - with react native may still not be quite
08:31 - on par with actual native apps written
08:34 - with Swift and Kotlin or Java so far
08:37 - we've talked about three programming
08:38 - languages and three cross-platform
08:40 - technologies for building mobile apps
08:42 - it's nice to imagine investing in and
08:44 - learning a single programming language
08:46 - that would allow you to build apps on
08:48 - multiple
08:48 - platforms in reality though it's not so
08:51 - realistic to have a single codebase that
08:53 - can be both an Android app and an iOS
08:56 - app just using these two platforms as an
08:59 - example both of them have very different
09:01 - guidelines on how user interface
09:03 - elements should look like how navigation
09:05 - should work and so on so even if you had
09:08 - a single codebase you'd probably have
09:10 - bits of code in there purely dedicated
09:12 - to tailoring the apps look and feel and
09:14 - maybe even behavior depending on whether
09:17 - the app is being run on iOS or Android
09:19 - furthermore if Google or Apple announces
09:22 - a new feature coming out on their latest
09:24 - version of their operating system it
09:26 - might not be immediately supported by
09:28 - your cross-platform technology of choice
09:30 - so you see if your goal is to build the
09:34 - best possible user experience for a
09:36 - specific app platform then go with the
09:39 - native language for that platform which
09:42 - brings us to number two and number one
09:46 - these two are tied for first place
09:48 - depending on which platform you want to
09:50 - build for Swift for iOS and Kotlin for
09:53 - Android these two along with Java for
09:56 - Android are considered first-class
09:58 - languages for their respective platforms
10:00 - and that means that using them you're
10:03 - going to get the best support the most
10:06 - control of and the most access to the
10:08 - platform itself and all of the features
10:11 - of the platform now I do want to speak a
10:13 - little bit about objective-c versus
10:15 - Swift and about Java versus Kotlin
10:22 - in regards to objective-c it's still in
10:24 - use and there are a ton of legacy iOS
10:27 - apps out there but Apple develops Swift
10:29 - to be better and faster so if you had to
10:32 - choose only one either objective-c or
10:35 - Swift I don't see a reason to choose
10:37 - Objective C fun fact Stack Overflow
10:40 - conducted a survey in 2019 asking
10:42 - developers for the most loved dreaded
10:45 - and wanted programming languages
10:47 - Objective C got second place for the
10:49 - most dreaded language as for Java versus
10:52 - : it's a harder choice because Java is
10:55 - still the number one most popular
10:57 - language according to this language
10:58 - index although developers agree that
11:01 - Kotlin is more concise than Java and
11:03 - it's also easier for beginners to learn
11:05 - the reality is that Java is so prevalent
11:08 - that learning it is never a bad thing
11:11 - for your career and I think this is
11:13 - where you have to ask yourself what your
11:14 - goals are because my list changes
11:16 - depending on what you're trying to
11:17 - achieve let's talk about that if your
11:20 - goal is to build cross-platform apps
11:21 - then I would say react native is your
11:23 - best bet it's got a larger community and
11:26 - more support compared to dart and
11:28 - flutter + learning JavaScript opens
11:30 - doors for you beyond mobile apps if your
11:32 - goal is to provide the best experience
11:34 - possible then go with the first-class
11:36 - language for the platform you're
11:38 - building for Swift for iOS and Java or
11:41 - Kotlin for Android if your goal is to
11:43 - keep your options open to explore other
11:45 - platforms and for maximizing job
11:47 - opportunities then I would suggest
11:49 - sticking with JavaScript or Java well I
11:52 - hope that was insightful for you guys do
11:54 - you agree or disagree with me please let
11:57 - me know by leave me a quick comment
11:58 - below I'd love to hear from you guys and
12:00 - lastly don't forget to give this video a
12:03 - thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't
12:05 - already hit that Bell notification icon
12:07 - so you don't miss the next video thank
12:09 - you so much I'll talk to you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hey code crew in this video I'll reveal my thoughts on what the top 5 programming languages for mobile apps are now just to burst your bubble right away there is no universal top language and that's because it largely depends on what your goals are are you looking for a job are you looking to build a app for a specific platform or are you trying to keep your options as open as possible all of these are factors to consider and we're gonna break it down in a variety of different angles in this upcoming list alright stay tuned hey there my name is Chris and if this is your first time here welcome to code with Chris where we'll teach you how to build an app even if you've never coded before before I revealed my list I want to pose a question to you what do you think is the best programming language for building mobile apps let me know by leaving a quick comment below and on your way down there if you wouldn't mind please hit the thumbs up button and subscribe if you haven't already I really appreciate that alright let's get started with number five and number five we have dart for building crossplatform native mobile apps using flutter a quick note if this is your first time hearing the term crossplatform it means that you can write a single codebase and deploy your app on multiple platforms such as iOS and Android awesome in theory but not so smooth sailing in practice now before we get too far off topic I'm not here to debate whether or not flutter is a good mobile crossplatform framework the topic of this video is to evaluate and rank programming languages so let's take a look at dart and what it's good for and what may be not so good about it dart is a relatively new programming language developed by Google described as a client optimised language for building fast apps you can build apps on mobile on desktop and even for backend so what are some pros and cons of Dart there are multiple ways to use dart for example dart comes with a

when the code is being converted from dart to JavaScript the dart2js compiler can make a lot of optimizations and shortcuts sacrificing the legibility and clarity of hen written code for speed and

a really cool language it doesn't seem like the first language I would choose to learn especially when it comes to some of the other languages that you're going to see in the rest of this video if you're in the boat where you're short on time and you have to choose only one programming language to invest your time into learning then there are a ton of other more popular languages out there that will give you a better return on investment especially from the angle of keeping your options open and finding jobs and now this brings us to language number four at number four we have HTML CSS and JavaScript for building mobile apps using PhoneGap okay first of all I realize that I just need three things and also if you want to get really technical with me technically HTML and CSS aren't
