00:00 - hello and welcome back so the mood
00:01 - Tracker app is finally done and we're
00:03 - doing some internal testing on it so in
00:05 - this Vlog I want to show you the
00:06 - finished product and I want to walk you
00:08 - through how test flight works both from
00:10 - the perspective of a beta tester
00:11 - submitting feedback and from the
00:13 - administration side to see how that
00:16 - feedback comes in but before we dive in
00:18 - just in case you're brand new here this
00:19 - is a raw and unscripted video series
00:21 - where I share the progress that our team
00:23 - is making towards building apps for
00:25 - profit now this Vlog entry is dated
00:28 - April 18th 2024 with that said I hope
00:30 - you enjoy the Vlog hello and welcome
00:33 - back it's Chris here so April 2nd our
00:35 - Target date for submitting the app to
00:38 - the App Store it has come and gone we
00:41 - weren't able to make that date but I do
00:43 - have some good news the app has been
00:45 - finished and we are now going through
00:48 - some internal testing so in this video I
00:51 - want to show you the state of the app
00:53 - how it works I also want to show you on
00:55 - the test flight side maybe you haven't
00:57 - seen how test flight works from the
00:59 - perspect perspective of the developer
01:01 - and how the feedback comes in I want to
01:03 - show you a little bit about that so
01:04 - first let's talk about the app here so
01:07 - when you launch it you're on this entry
01:09 - screen and I think last time I mentioned
01:11 - there should be a button here now it's
01:13 - there the other thing you can do we
01:15 - added the settings very basic just a
01:18 - couple of options
01:19 - here and we have a calendar so this
01:23 - calendar I think this was already
01:25 - working before but perhaps what wasn't
01:27 - working was tapping on a previous St to
01:30 - add an entry so perhaps I can like go
01:32 - back to April 16th it's April 18th today
01:36 - so I will go
01:38 - ahead and add something here maybe I
01:43 - decide that's enough so I can go ahead
01:46 - and do that save and exit and I have an
01:50 - entry here the other thing I can do is I
01:52 - can tap on an entry and I can edit
01:55 - something specific so I can go that Zoom
01:58 - me there and then I can save that
02:00 - specific thing and I can delete
02:04 - entries so that's really good and I can
02:07 - hit this button and log my moer today
02:10 - now that's basically it it's a pretty
02:13 - simple app on its own at least for this
02:16 - iteration now what we've done is created
02:20 - the app listing on the App Store connect
02:22 - if you're not familiar this is the
02:24 - portal where you manage all your apps
02:26 - and you create your app store listing so
02:28 - I just created one I haven't filled out
02:30 - any of the information but what I wanted
02:33 - to do was to use test flight to send out
02:36 - the build to our internal team so that
02:39 - we can start collecting feedback on
02:41 - things to
02:42 - fix now some things that I've identified
02:46 - here and actually want to get your input
02:48 - on as well is so immediately one thing
02:53 - that I don't think we should be able to
02:56 - see our future dates because it doesn't
02:59 - make sense for me to be able to log a
03:01 - date in the future right so I think that
03:05 - we shouldn't see all of these spots for
03:07 - future dates the other thing is I'm not
03:09 - sure about this scroll direction right
03:12 - so which one feels more natural to you
03:15 - and this is a question you can answer in
03:16 - the comments
03:17 - below should the previous dates
03:21 - be on top or on the bottom so I guess
03:27 - let me phrase this another way the most
03:30 - recent day which is today should that be
03:33 - at the very top or at the very bottom of
03:35 - the list now keep this in mind when I
03:38 - hit the
03:40 - calendar now I know I've got this one
03:43 - wrong so I specifically told the team
03:45 - that I wanted the most recent month at
03:47 - the top but when I when I actually
03:50 - started using this I'm like this doesn't
03:52 - really make sense at all because if you
03:53 - follow the dates April 1st and you go
03:56 - all the way to the
03:58 - bottom this month should be the next
04:01 - month so the calendar is wrong already
04:05 - be and that's due to my fault
04:07 - because I told the team to do it this
04:09 - way but now I realize I'm in the wrong
04:12 - so the most recent month should actually
04:14 - be at the bottom right and if you want
04:17 - to go into previous months like you want
04:19 - to go back in time you should be
04:21 - scrolling that down and you should see
04:24 - the previous months at the top so
04:27 - keeping that in mind now if we go back
04:29 - back to the entry screen what do you
04:32 - think we should we follow that same
04:36 - direction so that it's intuitively Mak
04:39 - sense if if that's the case then April
04:42 - 18th should be uh at the bottom and
04:45 - April 17th should be above it so you
04:48 - would scroll like exactly how it is
04:51 - right now except minus the ability to
04:54 - see future dates so it would be
04:56 - something like that perhaps when it's
04:58 - starting off the most recent one would
05:00 - be here but in a list the thing that I'm
05:04 - stuck on is like in a list usually you
05:07 - want the primary one at the top right
05:11 - the the thing that you want to see at
05:14 - the top and you would probably be more
05:16 - interested in the recency so to me in
05:20 - the list it almost seems like the most
05:23 - recent date should be at the top and
05:25 - then the previous dates would be at the
05:28 - trailing at the bottom and you would
05:30 - have to scroll this way to see older
05:32 - dates but then that opposite of how this
05:36 - calendar
05:37 - works so I don't know what's your
05:40 - opinion here the calendar definitely I'm
05:42 - already 100% sure how the calendar
05:44 - should work previous months should be at
05:47 - the top okay but it's this entries list
05:51 - that I'm not quite certain what we
05:53 - should do in which direction we should
05:55 - go some other things that um I
05:58 - identified that we should fix are the
06:01 - filter this is actually like a V2 thing
06:04 - I think I wasn't clear on the fact that
06:07 - this shouldn't be in
06:08 - V1 but here let me show you in test
06:11 - flight how some of the feedback comes in
06:14 - so when I send this out to the team if
06:17 - you've never gone through this test
06:18 - flight process before I add people via
06:21 - email then they get an email inviting
06:23 - them to test this uh beta build then
06:26 - they click the link and they have to
06:27 - install a test flight app on their phone
06:30 - and through that test flight app they
06:32 - can download this beta build that gets
06:34 - installed on the device so when they're
06:36 - using the app actually let me just plug
06:39 - in my phone and I'll show you how this
06:41 - works all right so I've connected my
06:42 - phone let me open up a quick time
06:47 - player and let me open up a new movie
06:51 - recording so I can show you the screen
06:53 - on my phone so I'm going to go
06:56 - screen
06:58 - phone all right there we
07:01 - go let me just move this to the center
07:04 - okay so I am going to open up test
07:07 - flight okay so this is what test flight
07:09 - looks like and as I said when I send out
07:12 - an email to someone so that they can
07:14 - test it they get an invite they launch
07:18 - that they click that link to launch this
07:21 - test flight app if they don't have it
07:23 - I'm sure it'll ask them to install it
07:25 - but then it's going to show up here and
07:27 - the user has the option to accept test
07:30 - so then when they hit install then it
07:32 - will appear on their device l so I'm
07:35 - going to go ahead and launch it
07:39 - and you know what this kind of looks
07:42 - oh maybe the build that I am running on
07:46 - the simulator it looks a little wait no
07:48 - it okay it does look the same so this is
07:51 - what it looks like with no entries so
07:53 - how do I send feedback let me go on my
07:56 - phone and this is how you send feedback
07:57 - so I take a screenshot
07:59 - of something let's say I see something I
08:02 - want to bug or crash or something so
08:05 - there's the screenshot I'm going to tap
08:06 - on the screenshot and then I can mark it
08:08 - up I can like Circle something maybe
08:10 - this is wrong or this is wrong or that's
08:13 - wrong and then I hit the arrow in the
08:15 - upper
08:17 - right and then I can say let us share
08:21 - beta feedback that's what I want to do
08:23 - right
08:25 - there okay and then I can say it can
08:28 - give some details
08:33 - please please
08:36 - fix that's the most
08:38 - undescriptive feedback ever do not
08:41 - submit feedback with that and then what
08:43 - happens is that on the admin side I can
08:46 - see the screenshot from
08:50 - here and I'm sure it'll show up in a
08:52 - second but here's a
08:54 - sample see so JC says we should not not
08:59 - use red for saving because it's not
09:03 - destructive that is very true should not
09:06 - do that it's great feedback other thing
09:09 - we can see are
09:13 - crashes now here's the cool thing inside
09:16 - xcode you can also see this feedback if
09:18 - you go uh to window you go to organizer
09:23 - believe yeah here it is under feedback
09:25 - you can see it here as well so it's
09:28 - really cool so that's where we're at
09:29 - right now we are a little bit behind I
09:33 - think we're getting there and it's
09:34 - really exciting to see the app come
09:35 - together now one thing that I would
09:38 - change in the future and I've been
09:40 - thinking about how this journey has gone
09:42 - for the mot trer app I think I need to
09:45 - tighten the Cycles I think even though
09:47 - this was an MVP it probably is still too
09:51 - many features I think we should have
09:52 - prioritized launching this thing way
09:55 - sooner and maybe not have had as many
09:58 - options as we did such as calendar
10:01 - screen such as having all these
10:03 - different questions to be asked I think
10:08 - oh yeah we should probably get rid of
10:10 - that scroll bar as well so I'm going to
10:12 - share that feedback yeah I think I would
10:15 - tighten up the cycle between having an
10:19 - idea and launching into the store
10:22 - because while we're able to build out a
10:25 - more robust app that had more
10:27 - functionality it did take quite a while
10:29 - to do and in that process I have to
10:32 - admit that there there was a lot of
10:35 - excitement and motivation on my part
10:37 - when I wanted to do this right from the
10:40 - beginning but then as time went on as
10:43 - more and more time went on I started
10:45 - losing more and more of that excitement
10:48 - that I had and I had the luxury of
10:51 - having our team work on this which meant
10:54 - that it would progress no matter how I
10:56 - felt about it but imagine if you are
10:59 - building something yourself or solo Dev
11:01 - your productivity and your progress on
11:03 - the app has a lot to do with your mind
11:06 - and how you're thinking about it and how
11:08 - motivated you are so I think by
11:10 - shortening the
11:12 - Cycles maybe this is a me Thing by
11:14 - shortening the Cycles you can keep that
11:16 - excitement up and launch something and
11:18 - then have the the excitement of it being
11:21 - live on the App Store and having some
11:23 - users download it and give you feedback
11:25 - and having that back and forth that can
11:27 - carry your excitement into
11:29 - doing several iterations to improve the
11:32 - product and add features again this may
11:34 - be a personal thing for me I tend to be
11:37 - a person that jumps from thing to thing
11:41 - I get really excited about something I
11:42 - really want to work on it I just like
11:45 - obsess about it almost but then if I
11:48 - don't want to do something hard for me
11:50 - to get myself to do it and I've learned
11:54 - this about myself so I try to find ways
11:57 - to mitigate that and to use it to my
12:00 - advantage rather than have it derail my
12:04 - projects so that anyways that's a whole
12:07 - other tangent about learning about
12:09 - yourself and trying to turn your
12:10 - weaknesses and the strengths and things
12:12 - like that anyways that's enough for this
12:14 - Vlog thank you so much for watching and
12:16 - sticking around on this journey
12:18 - hopefully the next time I record this we
12:20 - would have done our our internal testing
12:22 - we done that Sprint and then have it
12:25 - finally polished and submitted all right
12:28 - I'll see you in the next vlog

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back so the mood Tracker app is finally done and we're doing some internal testing on it so in this Vlog I want to show you the finished product and I want to walk you through how test flight works both from the perspective of a beta tester submitting feedback and from the administration side to see how that feedback comes in but before we dive in just in case you're brand new here this is a raw and unscripted video series where I share the progress that our team is making towards building apps for profit now this Vlog entry is dated April 18th 2024 with that said I hope you enjoy the Vlog hello and welcome back it's Chris here so April 2nd our Target date for submitting the app to the App Store it has come and gone we weren't able to make that date but I do have some good news the app has been finished and we are now going through some internal testing so in this video I want to show you the state of the app how it works I also want to show you on the test flight side maybe you haven't seen how test flight works from the perspect perspective of the developer and how the feedback comes in I want to show you a little bit about that so first let's talk about the app here so when you launch it you're on this entry screen and I think last time I mentioned there should be a button here now it's there the other thing you can do we added the settings very basic just a couple of options here and we have a calendar so this calendar I think this was already working before but perhaps what wasn't working was tapping on a previous St to add an entry so perhaps I can like go back to April 16th it's April 18th today so I will go ahead and add something here maybe I decide that's enough so I can go ahead and do that save and exit and I have an entry here the other thing I can do is I can tap on an entry and I can edit something specific so I can go that Zoom me there and then I can save that specific thing and I can delete entries so that's really good and I can hit this button and log my moer today now that's basically it it's a pretty simple app on its own at least for this iteration now what we've done is created the app listing on the App Store connect if you're not familiar this is the portal where you manage all your apps and you create your app store listing so I just created one I haven't filled out any of the information but what I
