00:00 - Hi.
My name is Stewart Lynch.
00:02 - This is the fifth of six videos
in the iOS concurrency series.
00:06 - By the end of the fourth video,
we had converted our getJSON function
00:10 - into one that uses the new Async and await
concurrency method introduced in iOS 15.
00:16 - In this video, we're going to extend
00:18 - that even further by introducing you
to parallel Asynchronous concurrency.
00:22 - Using Async lead,
we'll create a new model to contain a user
00:28 - and all of that users posts in an array
and use that model after fetching all
00:33 - users and posts up front and two
asynchronous calls in parallel when
00:37 - the user odes, thus potentially reducing
the number of network requests.
00:43 - Now, if you're just jumping into the start
00:45 - of this series,
you can download the completed code
00:47 - from the fourth video of this series
from the link in the description below.
00:53 - Now that we have much more easily readable
00:55 - code, I want to show you
where this really shines.
00:59 - Let's create a new experimental branch
01:01 - on this current branch,
so make sure you select
01:05 - the Source Control Navigator,
then right click on Async and await
01:10 - and create a new branch from here
and call it parallel concurrency
01:16 - and make sure you check out that branch
if it's not done automatically.
01:22 - What I'd like to do now is to fetch all
01:24 - of our users and all of the posts before
presenting the list view and add account
01:30 - of the number of posts per user alongside
their name in the user's list view.
01:36 - Then, since I have all of the users posts,
01:39 - I can pass them on to the post list view
for that user instead of when I get there.
01:45 - This should limit the number
of server requests to two.
01:48 - Then no matter how many times I go
01:50 - from users to posts,
so to do this, I'm going to need a new
01:55 - model that we can use
to consolidate this information
02:00 - in the Models folder,
create a new Swift file called User
02:03 - and Posts and in there create
a struct with the same name.
02:10 - I'm going to be using this in the users
02:12 - list view, so I want to conform
to the identifiable protocol.
02:20 - We'll need an ID property to make sure
that it does conform to that protocol,
02:24 - so to make it easy, let's just
create one and we'll use the UUID.
02:34 - Now each object will contain a user
and that users post
02:38 - the user will be of type user
and posts will be an array of post.
02:45 - I do want one more thing though,
02:47 - and that is the number of posts
so that I can display it.
02:50 - So I can create a computed property
for this called number of posts,
02:55 - and it will be an Int
that returns the post count
03:05 - in the user's list view model.
03:06 - Right now we have a single
function that fetches users.
03:10 - What if after we fetch users,
03:11 - then we fetch all of the posts and then
run a loop through our users,
03:16 - filtering the post by ID and then
assigning them to that user.
03:20 - So let's change this published property
03:23 - here to no longer be an array of user
but an array of user and posts.
03:32 - Of course, this is going to break our code
because we no longer have that published
03:36 - user's property,
but we still have to keep track of them
03:39 - until we build our now
empty user and post array.
03:43 - So let's just preface this with a let
03:46 - to create a constant users containing
the array of fetched users.
03:51 - But this is a new property and users won't
know what it's expecting to retrieve.
03:56 - So we'll need to specify that it
expects an array of user
04:02 - this convenient in it no longer uses any
04:06 - users, and we've not set up any in our
mock data for our new users and posts.
04:11 - So let's just comment this out for now.
04:17 - So how do we get all posts?
04:20 - Well, the URL for that can be found
in the API documentation,
04:25 - and we put that endpoint URL as
a comment at the top of our post struct.
04:30 - We'll copy that now and we'll create a new
instance of the API service passing.
04:37 - In that endpoint.
04:43 - Then we can asynchronously fetch all
04:45 - of the posts the same way that we
fetched all of our users.
04:48 - But this time for posts,
and it's an array of posts.
04:58 - Now, if we had to do this with our old
callback method, we'd be in a little bit
05:02 - of trouble since we would need to have
nested these requests within an API
05:06 - service getJSON callback function
with a completion handler.
05:11 - Here the power of async
and a weight really shines.
05:15 - This fetch post request won't be executed
05:18 - until the above one has completed,
so it looks almost synchronous.
05:24 - Well, now that we have both users
05:26 - and posts, we can loop on users,
and then we can determine that particular
05:32 - users post by filtering the post array
where the user ID is equal to the user ID.
05:41 - And we can use the array filter operation
05:43 - for this using a higher order
function really condenses your code.
05:49 - And if you're familiar with the syntax,
it's quite easy to read.
05:53 - If you are unfamiliar with this,
you can check out my video on higher order
05:56 - functions, and this one here in particular
includes the filter function.
06:03 - Now that we have a user and all of her
posts, we can create a new user and posts
06:10 - so we can pass in the user and all of her
06:12 - posts, and then we can append it to our
users and posts publish property
06:21 - users in list view, of course,
06:23 - is broken because we no longer
have an array of users.
06:26 - We have an array of user and posts.
06:29 - So in the navigation link we no longer
are going to pass in the user ID.
06:35 - We want to pass the entire array,
06:38 - so we'll just have to fix the post
list view as well in a minute.
06:42 - So for now, let's just change this to post
ListView posts being user and post posts
06:52 - for the label.
We'll need to change this to user and post
06:56 - user to access the user's name
and the user's email properties.
07:04 - I also mentioned we want to display
the number of posts so we can do
07:07 - that right here by embedding
the name text view in an H stack,
07:13 - and then after the name,
07:14 - we'll add a spacer
and then present another text view
07:18 - with the computed property of the number
of posts from our model and use string
07:24 - interpolation to surround
the number with brackets.
07:36 - All we have to do now is
fix up that post list view.
07:42 - Now, instead of having to create a view
07:44 - model, I can remove this
state object altogether.
07:48 - We're not expecting a user ID anymore.
07:51 - We're expecting an array of posts.
07:55 - Since our posts are no longer
in a view model, we can remove the VM.
08:01 - There will no longer be a need
for the alert here because we're not going
08:04 - to be fetching anything here,
and we can also remove the overlay
08:10 - and the task.
08:13 - Now our preview is complaining here,
08:15 - so we'll need to fix that,
which means that we'll need more mock
08:18 - data, but we'll come back
to that for the moment.
08:21 - Let's just comment the preview out here.
08:24 - I'm still getting an error
when I want to build.
08:27 - Yeah, I see.
I forgot that I commented
08:29 - on that convenience initializer,
so it no longer exists.
08:33 - So I need to remove it
here when we initialize.
08:39 - If we test this in the simulator now it
08:41 - works and we see the number
of posts Besides each user.
08:46 - It just so happens that this API
actually has ten posts per user.
08:50 - But trust me, if the count were different
per user, this would still work.
08:56 - So let's fix that mock
data for our preview.
09:02 - We can create a new extension in our mock
09:04 - data file for user and posts,
and then create a static computed property
09:10 - that's called users and posts that is
an array of our new user and post object.
09:19 - So we then repeat the same process that we
did when we are in our users view model.
09:27 - We'll create an empty array of new user
09:30 - and posts, and then we'll loop through
our mock users from the user model.
09:38 - We'll create a new user and post
09:42 - filtering the posts to get just
the post for that particular user,
10:00 - and then we'll append it to that new user
and post array,
10:05 - and once the loop is completed,
we can return the new users and posts
10:16 - back then to the user's list view model.
10:19 - We can fix that extension so that users
10:22 - and posts is user and post
mock users and posts,
10:31 - and then in the post list view.
10:32 - Then we can uncomment the preview
10:35 - to change that argument to post and pass
in the post mock single users post array.
10:45 - Then back in the users list view.
10:47 - We could add back that convenience
initializer because we have it again
10:51 - and whether we are in the preview mode or
not, we can decide if we want to see
10:56 - that mock data in the canvas
when it's set to true.
11:01 - If it's set to false, it disappears.
11:07 - If we go back and check out our code.
11:09 - Now, however, there is something
that can be improved on even more.
11:14 - We're fetching all of our users and then
11:16 - waiting until they're all fetched
before we fetch all of the posts.
11:20 - The fetching of the post is not
reliant on the fetching of users.
11:24 - In fact, we could be
doing this in parallel.
11:28 - Well, welcome to Async Lead.
11:31 - We can simply preface each of our API
11:34 - service calls with Async
so that it now reads async let.
11:42 - Now, this creates errors in our for loop
11:44 - because we'll need to wait for them
to have finished first before carrying
11:47 - on before we can access
both the users and posts.
11:51 - So we'll need to try and await for both.
11:54 - We can do that by assigning
them to a new variable.
11:58 - But as I said, we'll have
to await for both of them.
12:01 - So let fetched users fetch posts in the
tuple await for the users and posts.
12:10 - But as I said, these are failing because
we'll have to try for each of them.
12:19 - Then all we need to do in our loop
is to change user to fetch users
12:26 - and posts to fetch posts.
12:30 - We're now getting both the users and posts
12:33 - at the same time,
and then we can then run our loop
12:39 - testing.
12:39 - Now we see that it all works nicely and
we're now saving on costly network calls.
12:50 - Let's finish now.
12:51 - Then, by committing this
branch to our Git repository
13:02 - in the final video of this series,
we'll be checking out that old main branch
13:06 - again and branching off of it to change
our target back to iOS 14 and see if we
13:12 - can use these new Asynchronous
functions in an earlier iOS.
13:17 - This is what's promised in Xcode 13.
13:20 - Two.
13:24 - This should be interesting.
13:25 - So make sure you subscribe
13:26 - to Chris's Channel and ring this Bell
to get notification of new videos.
13:32 - Thanks for watching and see
you in the next one.
13:35 - Bye.
Okay.
13:37 - Bye.
