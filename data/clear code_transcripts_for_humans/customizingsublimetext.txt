00:00 - hello there in this tutorial we are
00:02 - going to customize the sublime code
00:04 - editor to make it look much
00:05 - nicer so we are going to start with this
00:08 - setup
00:08 - and change it to make it look like this
00:10 - and i feel this is much more enjoyable
00:12 - to work with because it just looks
00:14 - cleaner
00:15 - and well it's quite easy to achieve so
00:16 - let's jump right in alright
00:18 - so here i am in my desktop and i have a
00:21 - very basic version of sublime open
00:23 - there is a script right now that says
00:25 - print one and if i execute it
00:27 - i get one in the console quite easy and
00:29 - let me maximize it
00:30 - so that we can take the entire screen
00:32 - space and the first thing i want to
00:34 - achieve is to get rid of a couple of
00:36 - elements so i want to get rid of the
00:38 - tabs and i want to get rid of the status
00:40 - bar at the bottom
00:42 - and all of these can be very easily
00:44 - hidden all you have to do
00:46 - is go to view and here you can hide all
00:48 - the different things
00:50 - so the first one let's hide the tabs so
00:51 - i click on hide tabs
00:53 - and they're gone then i click on view
00:56 - again
00:56 - and then i can hide the status bar which
00:58 - is the bar at the bottom so i click on
01:00 - that
01:01 - and now we already have much more space
01:03 - and
01:04 - finally for the sidebar i can go to
01:06 - sidebar
01:08 - and hide sidebar so already with that
01:11 - we have much more screen space that
01:13 - feels much cleaner to work in
01:16 - the next thing you can do is to set all
01:18 - of this to full screen
01:19 - so if i press f11 we would have even
01:22 - more space
01:24 - and what you can do now is if you go to
01:26 - view again
01:28 - you can also click on hide menu and if i
01:31 - click on that
01:32 - now the entire page is just code
01:35 - so i still have my print and i can still
01:37 - run it but now all of this is looking
01:39 - much cleaner and i can just focus on my
01:40 - code
01:42 - if you want to have your menu bar back
01:44 - all you have to do is click on alt
01:46 - and then you can see it again and if i
01:48 - click on alt again it disappears
01:50 - so you only see it when you actually
01:52 - need it
01:54 - now there's one more thing that might be
01:55 - annoying you but to see that
01:57 - we have to have a bit more code so let
01:59 - me insert a few more lines
02:01 - and now we have quite a bit more code
02:04 - and you don't have to understand any of
02:06 - this this is just a placeholder
02:07 - effectively
02:09 - but what you can see now in the top
02:11 - right there's a minimap of our code
02:13 - which i generally feel is well mostly
02:16 - useless but you can use it if you like
02:18 - to get rid of it all you have to do is
02:21 - go to view
02:22 - and go to height minimap and now this
02:25 - part is gone
02:27 - and now we have what i feel is a much
02:31 - cleaner setup that feels more enjoyable
02:33 - to work in
02:34 - and you could leave it exactly like this
02:36 - and work perfectly well with it
02:38 - but what you can also do if you want to
02:40 - customize it even further is to change
02:42 - all the colors and the styling
02:45 - so let's go through that the very first
02:48 - thing we have to do
02:49 - is to open the command palette and this
02:51 - is a tool
02:52 - in sublime that lets you install a few
02:54 - more external modules
02:56 - and to open it press ctrl shift and p
03:00 - and then you should be seeing this menu
03:03 - and what i want to do in here is to type
03:05 - install package control i already get
03:07 - the preview
03:08 - and this package control would allow us
03:10 - to install different color themes for
03:12 - example
03:13 - so i select this one then nothing is
03:17 - going to happen for a second
03:18 - but then we get the message package
03:20 - control was successfully installed
03:22 - cool and now on the surface nothing has
03:24 - changed
03:25 - however now i can reopen the command
03:28 - palette by clicking ctrl shift and p
03:30 - and if i now type again install package
03:33 - and now i click enter now we get a
03:36 - option of
03:37 - all the different color schemes that we
03:39 - could be installing
03:41 - and there is a very great amount of
03:44 - different kind of styles in here
03:46 - and also a couple of extra modules that
03:48 - can add extra functionality
03:51 - in my case what i want to do is install
03:54 - a color scheme that is called
03:55 - base 16 color schemes so i just click on
03:58 - it and now again
04:00 - nothing has changed however if i open
04:02 - the command palette again
04:04 - now i can select a
04:07 - color scheme
04:15 - and now we can see all the different
04:16 - colors
04:19 - and some are much brighter than others
04:22 - and
04:23 - in here you can well check whatever you
04:26 - feel like
04:28 - in my case i went with a theme that's
04:31 - called base 16 google dark
04:34 - so i just select that and now we have a
04:36 - much darker color scheme which i feel is
04:39 - looking much nicer
04:40 - so this would be a color scheme and this
04:42 - would change how all the colors look
04:44 - in the actual font editor but what we
04:46 - can also do
04:47 - is if you look to the right we can see
04:49 - for example the scroll bar
04:51 - and this would be an element that is
04:53 - only influenced by a theme and so far we
04:55 - only installed a color scheme so those
04:57 - are two different elements
04:58 - so to change these elements we would
05:00 - have to install a theme
05:02 - and this happens in the same process so
05:04 - again i hope ctrl shift and p
05:06 - and i go back to install packages
05:10 - and now i would have to look for
05:11 - different themes in my case the one i
05:14 - went for is called
05:15 - theme cyanide so if they selected
05:18 - i press on enter and again nothing is
05:20 - happening
05:21 - although after a short amount of time we
05:23 - get the message that the theme was
05:24 - installed
05:25 - but that really doesn't matter all that
05:27 - much
05:28 - but so now what i can do is with the
05:30 - command pad open again
05:32 - i can type select theme
05:36 - and now i can select different themes
05:38 - and this
05:39 - is affecting all the other parts of
05:41 - sublime as well
05:43 - and in my case i went with a theme that
05:46 - is called alert which is
05:48 - a bit more on the red side although you
05:50 - can't really see too much of the theme
05:52 - the color scheme is
05:53 - much more impactful but it does add tiny
05:56 - details that make the entire thing look
05:57 - a bit nicer
05:59 - but okay let me go back to my previous
06:01 - code example
06:02 - so i go to view sidebar and show sidebar
06:05 - and
06:06 - here i have all of my code open and all
06:09 - of this is starting to look
06:10 - much nicer there are a couple of small
06:14 - things that i do want to change
06:16 - for example the size of the text and i
06:19 - don't want to have
06:20 - this blinking text cursor i want this to
06:22 - be static
06:23 - and these are things that you can
06:25 - influence in the settings menu
06:27 - so i click on alt again to see my menu i
06:30 - go to preferences
06:31 - and settings and here sublime is going
06:33 - to give me a whole new window
06:36 - and in here i can add a couple of more
06:39 - settings that i want to change
06:41 - and let's start with a really simple one
06:43 - i want to change my font size
06:45 - and to change that all i need is font
06:47 - underscore size
06:49 - then a double colon and now i need a
06:52 - number with the size of my text
06:54 - and you can see it here all of these are
06:57 - the default settings
06:58 - so right now the default setting is 10.
07:02 - and let's go with 16 for now just to
07:05 - make it a bit larger
07:08 - so now if i press ctrl s and save the
07:10 - entire thing
07:11 - we can already see that our bond size
07:13 - has become much larger
07:16 - so this would be one thing i do want to
07:17 - change another thing i would like to
07:19 - change
07:20 - is the blinking cursor because this one
07:22 - really annoys me
07:23 - and to target this one we need what is
07:25 - called the
07:26 - carrot style
07:30 - and here we have a couple of different
07:31 - options the one i want to go for
07:33 - is called solid and if i save now you
07:37 - can see what happens
07:38 - now the carrot or this blinking cursor
07:40 - is not blinking anymore
07:42 - which i feel is making the entire setup
07:44 - a lot more calm
07:46 - what i also want to achieve is that the
07:47 - line i'm on is highlighted so that i
07:49 - know exactly where i
07:50 - am and to achieve that i have to add a
07:53 - new entry in here that is called
07:55 - highlight line
07:58 - let me just spell it properly
08:02 - and all we have to do in here is type
08:04 - the word true
08:08 - and now if i save it we get our line
08:10 - highlighted which makes it much clearer
08:13 - where stuff is or where i'm working in
08:15 - there is one more minor thing that can
08:17 - be changed although that's not too
08:19 - important
08:20 - that if you look at the scoreboard to
08:22 - the right it looks quite large and it's
08:24 - annoying me a little bit
08:26 - but the theme we have installed right
08:27 - now actually has a much smaller scroll
08:29 - bar
08:30 - so i want to show the scroll bar of the
08:31 - theme not the default one
08:33 - and to achieve that what we have to do
08:36 - is type
08:36 - over lay
08:40 - scroll bars
08:45 - and this one has to be the text enabled
08:49 - also in quotation marks and now if i
08:52 - save
08:54 - we get a much smaller scroll bar that is
08:56 - in line with the theme
08:57 - i don't actually know why you need this
08:59 - line specifically i feel like this
09:01 - should be standard behavior
09:03 - but never mind and this is
09:06 - all i needed now there's one more thing
09:10 - that i would like to change and let me
09:11 - close the settings
09:13 - and right now i want to hide this
09:15 - sidebar
09:16 - so i go to view sidebar and hide sidebar
09:20 - but now the problem is that opening and
09:22 - closing this thing again can be kind of
09:24 - annoying
09:25 - so i mapped it to a specific key the key
09:28 - that i don't really know the name of
09:30 - it's the key that's below escape
09:32 - and above the tab and since i never used
09:34 - that key i just mapped it to open the
09:36 - sidebar
09:37 - and to change that all i have to do is
09:38 - go to preferences and key bindings
09:42 - and let me maximize this as well and in
09:45 - here
09:45 - we have all the key bindings of sublime
09:51 - and if you have this bar selected you
09:52 - can press ctrl f
09:54 - and look for different things the one i
09:56 - want to look for
09:57 - is the side under scroll bar
10:01 - and it's not supposed to be focus it's
10:03 - supposed to be toggle
10:05 - so all i have to do is copy the entire
10:07 - line here
10:09 - and paste it into the user settings
10:12 - so all of these are the default ones and
10:14 - these are the ones i specifically
10:16 - changed
10:18 - and right now we could use control plus
10:20 - k or control plus b
10:22 - but i don't want to use either of them
10:26 - so i'd get rid of them and instead what
10:28 - i want to do
10:29 - is to use the key i described earlier so
10:32 - if you just press it you get
10:33 - this symbol and now if i save
10:37 - nothing happens on the surface but if i
10:39 - close this now i can press this button
10:42 - and open and close the sidebar very
10:43 - easily and change between
10:45 - different parts of my code or different
10:47 - code files entirely
10:49 - and alright this is all we needed so i
10:52 - hope that was helpful
10:53 - and i will see you around

Cleaned transcript:

hello there in this tutorial we are going to customize the sublime code editor to make it look much nicer so we are going to start with this setup and change it to make it look like this and i feel this is much more enjoyable to work with because it just looks cleaner and well it's quite easy to achieve so let's jump right in alright so here i am in my desktop and i have a very basic version of sublime open there is a script right now that says print one and if i execute it i get one in the console quite easy and let me maximize it so that we can take the entire screen space and the first thing i want to achieve is to get rid of a couple of elements so i want to get rid of the tabs and i want to get rid of the status bar at the bottom and all of these can be very easily hidden all you
