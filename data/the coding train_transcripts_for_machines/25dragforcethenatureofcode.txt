okay now that we've looked at friction I want to look at another case study of a formula that we defined in a physics textbook and how we could unpack and understand that formula and apply it in a piece of code in a processing simulation you know with circle moving around the screen because that's what we do with our lives we sit around and we move circles around the screen okay so what I want to look at is a drag force now drag force also known as viscous force fluid resistance air resistance we're talking about a force when a body comes into contact with a liquid or gas it experiences a force again in the opposite direction something falling experiences an air resistance of force pushing it back up so let's take a look at the first so it's very similar to friction conceptually but it actually is a operates in a different way which is kind of interesting to look at so let's take a look at the formula okay first of all have to remember this formula and I might fail but I'm gonna give this a try okay the force of drag I have a way of looking it up equals plus I go is just start this video over negative one half times Rho times V squared which I really mean the magnitude of velocity the velocity squared the speed squared maybe I'll put do this times a times the coefficient of drag times velocity unit vector okay look at this formula oh this one really looks awful right like how are we gonna figure out all these pieces but you know it's axe first of all the formula itself is really simple it's this times this times this times this times this times this so if we just know what each one of those things are we just multiply them all together you know it looks a little fancy because it's kind of like got some Greek letters in it and we don't know what all these things that has one row but and I didn't even write that very well but the point is these formulas actually aren't that difficult to understand even if they look a little bit kind of unapproachable but the thing about this formula we have to ask ourselves is what do we really need here so what are all the elements of this form okay well negative 1/2 that's clearly a constant rohroh stands for density so density you can think of as you know how dense the material is that you're moving through air versus water versus mud versus something else v squared so V is the velocity the magnitude the velocity squared the magnitude of velocity squared magnitude of velocity you can think of a speed how fast is something going I'm recording so that's kind of interesting right we can see just by this formula here that the faster something is moving the more air resistance it will more sorry drag it will experience that is a very important factor right in fact it's such an important fact that something have is a different Clementine that's the same line that this Clementine right if it's not moving right now if I could hold it perfectly still no drag resistance on it whatsoever only if it's moving is it experiencing that force and the faster it's moving the stronger that force this is very important and this is kind of like the thing about all of this is and I need to say this at the appropriate time but I'm just gonna say it now the point of looking at this stuff is not because aha you want to make interesting things in processing and programming and graphics fluid resistance is the answer to everything you ever imagined that's not at all the case here this is just saying like look if we can understand how to do this number one a we can invent our own forces and B we might be able to find other forces and be able to understand how to unpack those formulas and use them so it's really not about using this particular force but you know in these videos I gotta have something to start with so this is really why I like to say sort of like a case study and looking at something but what's really I think useful about this in particulars realizing I could have something that's tied to an object's probably the properties of that object a force that's tied to how fast it moves how big it is what color it is there's so many things that you could kind of choose to do in a creative way so but here the speed squared a so this is speed squared a is a surfacearea right there's a big difference in the air resistance this will experience versus this will experience this really aerodynamic dry erase marker versus the kind of surface area on the bottom of this Clementine is much larger than the pointy end of this marker terrible you know I don't know what did physics people who teach physics must have all these like props and things to demonstrate with this like clementines okay so the good see how surface area is important and then aha coefficient of drag this is the coefficient of drag well again this is just like the coefficient of friction what are the two things that are coming in contact with each other what what's what's the liquid or gas what's the object there's a coefficient there that will describe the strength of that force and then you know velocity unit vector because AHA there's a negative here and there's a velocity unit vector we're going in the opposite direction of our velocity so a cold by the way do you tell coming on okay so looking at all this stuff let's ask ourselves a question what is the density I have an idea the density is 1 what is the surface area I have an idea the surface area is 1 like we might someday have a simulation where we really want to model that where we have strangely shaped polygons and the actual and as they're moving through this like liquidy thing and the surface area actually makes a difference in how they move but right now if you recall you have a circle or gray circle moving around the surface area it's gonna be the same for all the circles whatever let's not worry about it let's make our let let's make we just want it to look kind of like air resistance so let's just make our life easier let's set that equal to 1 but really you know that's a constant that's a constant negative 1/2 as a constant coefficient drag is a constant all of these things are constants we could really simplify this formula to say we have negative some constant times the sorry the velocity squared times the velocity unit vector right we could simplify the form and say all of these things are constants we just need we just need to know is the a is the fluid is the drag force strong or weak is it like water jelly light refreshing air I don't know what is it is it strong or weak how fast is it going and what's the direction so this is really good and we can just we can start to we can start to write our code now we can start to say what is the again we need to know direction and magnitude same thing as friction direction and magnitude well the truth of the matter is I wish I hadn't erased what we had there before because Direction is exactly the same thing we want to I'm gonna call this drag we want to get velocity we want to normalize velocity and then we want to multiply it by negative one that's getting the direction we've taken care of the direction the force again remember what we're doing here whenever we want to calculate a force we need to know what ways the force pointing and how strong is it first let's get the direction let's get a unit vector pointing in the right direction then let's calculate the magnitude and let's scale that vector now we need to calculate the magnitude what is the magnitude well we did earlier up here we got a copy of the velocity vector so we probably couldn't might make sense to insert a line of code up there where we say speed equals that velocities magnitude right next we don't need to put it up there because we can just do it down here speed equals that velocities magnitude and then some constant C equals you know some value 0.01 and now drag we just need to multiply it by that constant times the speed times the speed right we've got the form we've got the formula formula boils down to a constant times the speed squared times the content of speed squared times the velocity unit vector and the opposite we already got the vector in the opposite direction now we have the magnitude is a constant times the speed times the speed speed squared great we did it it's really as simple as doing this and this I hopefully will give us some interesting results that we can look at so let's try to apply this now in our code or it's gonna rewrite exactly what we mapped out here into our code okay we're back and we're looking at this and we're kind of gonna do the same thing I'm gonna rename it drag and I'm also need to get the speed that's the only thing we don't have from before am i over here yeah the speed is the Ville of the movers velocity magnitude and then and actually you know what's kind of amazing about things sometimes I don't know this is not amazing but it just occurred to me right I could say speed equals speed times two right now now times two uh this video I really should restart it speed equals speed times speed I could say speed times speed but and that's what I should do I don't know what but there is by the way a function in processing yeah maybe it's just not and maybe it's just not turning blue because it's not in yeah it's fine um so there's a function called mag sq which actually gives you the magnitude squared so we could actually ask the velocity vector to give us its speed squared just from it but III thought I went off on a tangent there and somebody will download this video and edit this part out and then send it to me but and then we're back right here and we're looking at the magnitude and now we're going to say hey let's multiply to scale it according to the coefficient of drag times speed squared and then let's apply that force to the object and now look okay so we have this thing falling bouncing up and down and as soon as I click the mouse we're gonna see a drag force and you can see that it actually it kind of it's a little bit overwhelmingly strong so let's just sort of tune it down a little bit tone it down a little bit and let's try it again but you can see you can see it kind of it's still pretty strong but you can see it's really working and what's interesting about it is it almost reaches this what you might look like a terminal velocity and this is what happens there's a point where the air is when something is falling where the air resistance and the force of gravity become essentially equal and so there's the net result of those two forces is zero and the object falls at a constant velocity right because the faster and faster it's going air resistance gets gets larger and larger and larger because the speed is part of that air resistance magnitude so let me just so you can see one thing that I should point out about these examples is I'm just kind of like writing some code getting velocities make it to Forces blah blah blah blah blah here in the main program where are we we're in draw right we have a mover we make a new mover we say update edges display for this mover and you know somewhere here I'm calculating this drag force but really there's a plenty better objectoriented programming way that we could do this and I just want to look at that here's an example that I'm going to show you this is an example two point five in the book and what's one thing about this that I think is useful to look at is that first of all the objects they don't experience air resistance here they're only experiencing a fluid resistance when they land in when they when they're in this sort of darker area at the bottom so you can see that they're falling at this speed and then they slow down when they hit there and what's interesting about this is the smaller ones right D so much more slowly than the larger ones why is that remember acceleration equals force divided by mass so they may all experience the same drag force but their accelerations can be scaled according to how big they are the bigger ones are able to like plow right through that liquid which the smaller ones aren't able to do that as easily but what I wanted to look at this though is just to say look you can't really see this but there is up here now a liquid class so in addition to a mover I've made a liquid class and the liquid class describes this kind of rectangular area here and if we look at it we can see the liquid has an X Y a width and height in a coefficient of drag so it's defining an area and a coefficient how strong is it and what's interesting about this as you can see we have some functions if the liquid contains the mover then the liquid to dry that mover so we've taken that formula we learned and we put it into a function essentially inside the liquid class this is a function which says let me receive a mover let me calculate that drag force through all the methodology we just did and then return it back so this is actually quite a useful thing when you want objects to exert forces on each other you need one object to receive as an argument another object and then compute that force and then apply it or return it or whatever the sort of structure you're doing is so the perhaps sometime this merits kind of its own video or discussion about how objects might talk to each other in a way and that's really what we're doing here I don't know maybe I'll hear from some people to hear whether this is unclear and we need some to sort of elaborate on this but that's what I wanted to point out about this particular video so one thing you might do now is take a look at this and see could you create a more elaborate scenario could you create a larger sort of space on the screen with all sorts of different pockets of resistance some weak some strong and what if you made something that actually sort of weirdly caused the object to speed up as it goes through it this sort of like inverse drag force I mean that may not really exist in the world but you could sort of think of some type of interactive system that you could make where you're trying to avoid the parts that slow you down and get into the parts that speed you up so these are some ideas for some things you might want to play around with in looking through and these formulas these examples or something okay uh thank you for listening I very grateful I really but noise brought it you know it's Riya at this point anymore so no one just heard me say that but that's fine you don't need to hear any of this okay goodbye I'll see you again in momentarily perhaps in the next video or Never I don't know if I'm really seeing I'm gonna press the button now
