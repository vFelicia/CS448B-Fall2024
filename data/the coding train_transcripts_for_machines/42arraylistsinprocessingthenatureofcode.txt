okay now that that first video is out of the way we're back and we're ready to deal with the Practical side of particle systems and that practical side that we're going to start with is an array list what is an array list well before we even get to an what is an array list let's talk about why we might want an array list okay so you have a particle object now you want to have many particle objects your first thing you're going to do is say aha I used to declare a variable particle P now I'm going to declare an array of particles so I'm going to say I'm going to come over here where I don't really have any room to stand but I'm going to say ah particle brackets uh particles equals new particle 100 semicolon right what have we written out here this is an array declaration we have a type particle the brackets indicate it's going to be an array our name is particles and then we have 100 elements 100 particles in that array this is what we're used to then we can Loop through that array and we can draw all them and update them and do all sorts of things great the issue is what if we want to start with zero particles and then add one then add one then add one then delete them and delete one we could kind of do that with an array we could have a variable to keep track of what part of the array are we using I's use this section we could reuse elements there's also even in processing if you look through the processing uh documentation there's append contract there's a bunch of functions that seem to like add and subtract stuff from the array and the syntax is kind of weird and it's confusing and then you know it's just not a it's not a place we want to go to right now the place we want to go to is using an array list an array list is going to allow us to have this essentially this like empty bucket this empty bucket where we can put particles in we can take particles out we can manage our system of objects it's going to be great so how do we know how do we learn about what an array list is okay so there's a couple places that we could go to just just that that I think I should mention before we start kind of mapping out the parts of what an array list is that we need to know so number one is processing okay so an array list is not really something that is part of processing an arrayas is a class that's part of java but it's so commonly used that it's that that you will find it documented on the processing website so you will find a a documentation page with a little bit of an examples and it says in the description and array list stores a variable number of objects and this is great so we could find out some initial information here and you can see ah there's a size method an add method a get a remove and in fact those are the methods that we're going to want so for the kind of easygoing introduction to the concept of an array list this processing reference page is going to be perfect for us however um it I should note that where it really comes from is from java so there is this kind of balloon giant like read all this stuff about what an array list is this is the Java reference page and you can see look at all of these methods add at all clone ensure capacity get is empty remove remove range so there's a huge amount of things that an a rail list can do but what we want to look at is a kind of subset of that we're going to start by looking at just a small list of methods in an array list um so you know what I'm just forget about it we don't even need this anymore we want to make sure we are comfortable with this idea of adding to an array list we want to sometimes get things out of an array list sometimes we want to remove things from an array list and sometimes we need to know the size of the array list so this can kind of be our list of methods that we're going to need to feel comfortable with in order to program this particle system simulation within Ray list hooray okay low energy day low energy day okay um don't fall asleep wake up okay uh all right so how do we even start okay how do we even start let's say we we're assuming the existence of a class called particle so this class called particle we assume exists so we're going to make an array list with particle objects in it now there's some funny bit of syntax here that's I want to say new but I think it's years old at this point it just it feels new because when I first started working with array list it didn't exist but when we declare an array list I'm going to declare an array list over here I'm going say hey I'm going to have an array list and I'm going to call it particles okay so here's the thing about this declaration one of the things about array list is they are it's a general purpose bucket that you can put any kind of objects you want to in I could put some particles in and some movers in and some P fonts in a couple P images and I could just start putting objects in there but this is not typically how you use an array list typically use an array list to collect a bunch of the same kinds of objects and in our case this is exactly what we're going to do we know that this array list that we're about to make we're only ever going to put particle objects in it so we can specify in advance at the moment that we're going to create this array list called particles that what it's Our intention to put particle objects in it this is called generics the syntax is called generics and the way that we do that I'm like standing in the strangest way ever is by use of the less than and greater than signs and we put we put the type in in in in between those signs so we're saying I'm going to have an array list it's going to be full of particle objects and we're going to call it particles now just for the purpose of this demonstration a it's going to allow me to write less things on the board but also to emphasize remember this is your variable name it can be anything you want and often it is confusing I have an array list with particle objects I'm calling a particles and I get a particle what's what so we're going to have an array list of with particle objects in it I'm going to call it just a so we're not done anytime that you have a variable right anytime that you have an object you need to declare the object and you need to initialize that object you initialize an array list by calling the Constructor just like you say particle P equals new particle we're now going to say array list a equals new array list and I could do that in one line of code but just to demonstrate here on the board I'm going to say a equals new array list and this is another moment where I need to specify what goes in it a is a new array list with particle objects in it so this is all we need this is the beginnings of what we need we need to declare a variable of type array list say what we're going to put in the array list and then we need to call the Constructor to have this empty bucket now that we have this empty bucket we are golden we can start using add get remove size we can do all of these things and one of the first things we might do is just say hey let's add a new particle object into our array list we can do this at any point we could do this when we click the mouse we could do it in setup we could do it over and over again in draw we can add particles to that array list and okay so boy there's a lot of stuff here and we've been seven minutes this is going to be everything's fine I'm need to edit this part out okay I'm just trying to map out in my brain where we're going with this okay where are we we let's go over to our example for a sec okay so here we are and we have our uh particle example before with a single particle now what we want to do is add an array list to this example so that we could eventually have multiple particles so instead of the single particle variable at the top we want to type in an array list called particles instead of initializing that single particle we are going to initial uze an array list that will have particle objects in it and and this is no longer uh relevant but we'll we'll come back to it in a second so here we go now our program has an array list but it's empty there's nothing in it there's no particles in it so we could say aha let's add particles in it maybe we want to start with 10 particles how would we start with 10 well how would we even have one we know the add method allows us to add a particle object so we can call add on the array list and put in any object reference a new particle in this case and put that in the array list if we want to add 10 I could just say I don't know let's just have a little Loop and you can see now there's 10 particles in the array list so now how do we update and display all those array all those particles that are in the array list okay so now we need to go back we need another function for that all we know now is how to create the array list and how to add things to it now we need to access the elements of that array list okay so to access the elements of that array list okay we've done add get is going to do that for us get is a way of getting objects from the array list so that we can access them and call methods on them so how do we do that for number one is I could say hey a our our particle system by the way over here is called a in the example we're building is called particles and that's fine because we can make up any variable names we want a.get zero this would get the zero element out of that array list what do I mean by zero element well remember an array is a list of elements a regular array which each element has an index and if we had an a regular array called you know my array we would access the first element by its index with brackets brackets we put zero in between the brackets and we're talking about this element right here well the get function in the array list does exactly the same thing as the brackets do with a regular array so what are we doing what is get actually get actually returns for us a reference to an array to it so to it to that object in that spot okay right so particle P equals a. get zero this gives us that first particle out of the array list so that's kind of getting us closer and we can go over here to this example and we could say all right let's just confirm that that actually works I'm going to say particle P equals particles. getet 0o p. update p. display and if we run this we can see great there's that there's that first particle and I could say hey there were 10 in there let's get the fifth one our index number four hey there's that one so clearly this works we have an array list we can put stuff in it we can get stuff out of it and we can do stuff to it but obviously we need to do this with a loop right we want to say for every particle in the array list update and display for every particle in the array list update and display for every particle in the array list update and display how do we say that well one this is a moment if you haven't used this kind of loop before in processing going to erase all this because this is like a thrilling moment in my life when I discovered you know if you ever programmed in all these other languages you have all these four each Loops which seem really convenient you don't need to count I and index you can do that in processing you actually do this with regular arrays or with an array list this is just a nice moment to see that this kind of loop works we want to say for every particle P colon in the array list in this case a update and also display so if you haven't seen a loop like this before here it is this is called an enhanced for Loop what it's doing is saying there is a list called a it has particle objects in it we can just this Loop says whatever's in there access every single one and update them and so we can put this into our program over here and we can say for every particle sorry for every particle p in the array list particles p. update p. display and here we go boom we see this like little mini explosion right at the beginning it's 10 of 10 particles let's see if we can make that happen again I don't know why we need to we want to see it again poof okay so we can see that this is working this is very exciting we have a list we've added 10 particles to that list and now we know how to access all 10 and call methods on them update display update and display we see them all now they're gone when they're gone we should really delete them from the list so that's the next step I'm going to actually stop this video right here we're going to the next step is going to be deleting elements from that array list and once we have that then we're going to have to look at hey we don't what we want to do is all this gobbly good code that's in our setup and draw this is all actually a could be code that's in a system class so the particle class talks about an individual object the system class manages the list of those objects so we're going to get to all of that so what I would say to you is if you're following along find that example you had with your single object moving and try to make an array list of them try to do things like maybe add to the array list when you click the mouse uh you know see if you can start with nothing then add 20 then add one see if you can kind of add to it in a in a with some logic that happens over time by some means okay so um this is the end of this video goodbye
