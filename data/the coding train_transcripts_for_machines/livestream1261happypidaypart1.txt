oh hello and happy pi day today is actually nope the date it is March 14th 2018 which is otherwise known as pi day my name is Dan Shipman and you the person behind this circular lens thing are watching the coding train I almost sound like fun fun function for some reason okay so it's I'm doing my livestream today Wednesday I would also like to dedicate this live stream to the late great Stephen Hawking you know gonna pick a day gonna be pi day is a pretty good day and so Stephen Hawking is certainly I could say a lot about the inspirational figure that Stephen Hawking isn't was but I'm gonna go on and just say that we're gonna make some fun stuff we're gonna learn up but I don't know if we're gonna learn anyone's gonna learn anything I'm gonna learn something and I'm gonna do some stuff with PI okay so people are mentioning so I have a new hoodie I don't think I'm gonna I don't gonna wear this too often this is a little bit strange hoodie in fact it is a unicorn hoodie my wife purchased this for me and said please wear this like six months ago and I've gotten around to it but I'm wearing it today special for pi day hopefully that didn't mess up the micro but does have some green on it which is a bit of a problem or feature I guess alright so what's going to happen today I don't exactly entirely know frankly I would like to do a series of in an ideal world I would like to do a series of coding challenges themed around pi the number pi otherwise known as half towel but so that's one thing it's gonna happen I will be using processing I'm gonna do everything in processing today to have a standalone editor that you can download and type the code in and run if you're following along at home or wherever you may be there's actually a new version of processing that came out so I'm going to download that I all wanting for a really long time to do a tutorial about how to build a processing library which involves going into the darkness of Java Docs and eclipse so I'm certainly not gonna start with that but if there is time or if I can even come back for a part two of today I actually worked on it implementing an algorithm to generate the digits of pi in sequence and it takes a very long time so it's kind of a nice it could be a good example for processing library that could be running in the background in a separate thread that gives you an event like just like you have in mousepressed or I don't remember what anything was calls processing it works after event we could have PI event PI digit event and you get a new digit of pi every so often so that might be I would love to do that if not today at some point in the future I also want to say that I am also going to him who's like folding everything into one special livestream so I mentioned pi day I mentioned Stephen Hawking I would like to mention International Women's Day which I know was last Thursday but I am in fact I am running in a half marathon the New York City half marathon this Sunday and so I would like to take a minute to plug my fundraiser for a wonderful organization the Lower East Side Girls Club my goal is to raise fifteen hundred dollars for them thank you to the 14 people who have donated if someone could post a link to this in the chat and certainly if you're watching this an archive the link to this will be in the description of this video the Laurie said Girls Club is a wonderful organization I encourage you to read about them they have many amazing programs they're just a hop skip and a jump away from where I am right now I've participated in some of their educational programs they have an actual planetarium at the lower Eastside Girls Club which is totally amazing and I will be running 13.1 miles which is some amount of Pi this Sunday starting at 730 a.m. I don't know maybe you can track me online somehow my goal is to finish in under two hours that's not gonna happen but you know probably two to two hours in ten minutes under well certainly I think habits oh okay so today's pie de pie theme coding challenges Stephen Hawking rest in peace Stephen Hawking Laurie said girls club wonderful organization these PI themed cutting challenges are also in honor of the Lower East Side Girls Club in this fundraiser okay that is all that I will say about that I suppose if you donate during this live stream and your name shows up under recent donations I will thank you live on air I will also take any super chat donations made for the super chat and i will donate those to the lower east side girls club so this is the one day thank you anonymous fifteen days ago this is the one day that I would normally have the super Chad anyway super cat donations I will take okay now Thank You Simon I'm a for your calculate pi in three ways github issue let's now go look and see a few things so first of all let me plug some stuff this is a wonderful program made by a design firm in Boston fathom information design and which is a company led by Ben fry who is the creator of one of the creators of processing along with Casey Reis and what I love about this is it searches through ten million digits of pi and I could look for I don't know one two three four five six so somewhere in PI oh one two three four five six is not in the first 1 million digits of pi one two three does not hold on and go go back but one two three four five is and it is there it's the 49 thousand seven hundred second digit of pi so this would be an interesting kind of coding challenge to make something like this and I have in advance I bookmarked a link to a file that has 10 million digits of pi that is from thank you robbed and Pogo launcher that's really nice of you for your donations that will go towards the lower Eastside girls club and I also bookmarked a file that has from MIT that has 1 billion digits of pi in it so we can potentially use these I thought I'd downloaded these as well I'm curious how big they are let's take a look whoops but what I want to start with I think what I'm gonna I want to open up the github issues in a second here which have suggestions so this is the 1 billion let's see let me download this I thought I'd do this already but let me let me download this to the desktop ooh it is about a gigabyte which is you know we're getting 1 billion digits of pi in one file that's pretty good we can work with that we can definitely work with that so we could do something with 1 billion digits of pi I don't know what the interesting to compute the average value of all the digits all right oh yes and in the in the chat Chicken McNugget hello chicken mcnuggets suggests calculating pi using the chudnofsky formula and I was thinking about doing this and actually one of my favorite YouTube channel standup maths I have to show this to you stand up maths is a YouTube channel from Matt Parker and I'm gonna go a Matt Parker has a video that came out today calculating PI with the trig Nevsky method which you can see is this formula so what's interesting what's amazing about his video that came out today doing this all by hand every year I think this process was possibly the third time he does a video about he does a video about calculating PI from hand by hand and so what I love about this this video speak spoke to me so much because if I if I go along and you should watch this whole thing on your own but I'm gonna skip to a certain part watch this this morning over breakfast okay so right here I'm gonna just narrate what's happening no no a little further okay here so right here he just so this is like this is an edited version of him doing this crazy crazy like longdivision thing and it's probably spent hours and hours doing it and at this moment right here he discovers a mistake let me plug the audio in for you so you can hear I just have to change the system preferences I think if I change this you're gonna hear the audio so I feel like misspoke so much to me because that goes on and on and on and on and on and on completing the whole entire sequence with this mistake and this I feel like it's what happens to me in every single programming coding challenge I have ever done as you all have witnessed so I encourage you to check out this video it's wonderful I on the other hand would if I'm going to if try to implement this algorithm I would just use the computer to do it which is interesting and actually there's a really amazing um history of calculating PI it's a Wikipedia page I think chronology of computation of PI this is amazing to go through to think about you know how the ancient Egyptians and the ancient Babylonians you know this is pretty good three plus oneeighth I don't know pi PI day complete thank you everybody we have approximated PI here on the coding train I will see you next week but and you could see now where are we we are at this is the most recent world record it took a hundred of five days to calculate million billion 22 trillion or so digits there's a program actually that you can find called Y cruncher there's a Windows and Linux version of this program that you can run to calculate all the digits of pi and I have a processing sketch that I will demonstrate to you I ran overnight I mean it last night I ran over night and it calculated about 8,000 digits of pi it was on a very it was on this like very small computer here so this is super interesting but I am I am going to I'm gonna do two things today the first thing is I'm going to use a method to approximate PI that's kind of an interesting one this method is inspired by a video that came out yesterday over the last couple days from stem coding which is also a wonderful YouTube channel let me go to the github issues so this this was suggested here with approximate PI with physics thank you a Krauss oh and thank you by the way to Matthew in the patron group who made this little happy pi day thing to put in my wallpaper thank you for that so I'm going to go to this issue approximate PI with physics and then I'm also going to reference so the shed Nazi algorithm is referenced right here as well boy wouldn't be nice to do all of these PI approximation where is it pi day where's the one from stem coding did I not label it if I forgot to label it Chris orbit here it is stem coding so one thing I want to do is encourage you to check out the stem coding YouTube channel let me just click to this link I guess which will get me there the stem coding YouTube channel has is has a video doing exactly basically what I'm going to do and also has an incredible amount of other types of cool coding tutorials in other STEM related topics I highly recommend you check it out oh look and they even have me here and stuff from other people we think is great I should make a playlist and I would put stem coding in that playlist for stuff I think is great so I encourage you they have an outtakes and bloopers which is basically that's my entire channel so I encourage you to check that out so let's look though so you can you can find out some more information in this github issue but let's this set as kind of a nice description of the of the first way of the first way that I want to do it okay now so unfortunately I just cameras off I have to erase this whiteboard who really meant to erase it I'm a little bit sad about erasing this whiteboard because I'm in the middle of a series of working on a neuro evolution tutorial where I'm going to create a bot you know or an algorithm to automatically play a simple game like flappy bird and this was where I left off and so when I continue that series I kind of want this to be here but I will just and one is maybe I don't need it and to to I can always rewrite it so 3.1415926 I think that's as far as I know off the top of my head oh we're definitely gonna do a dramatic reading of all the digits of pi today no need for the random number book when I could just oh I forgot to actually that's one thing I would love to make and I could do it in processing by generating a PDF is create the book of Pi and so actually maybe we can take that 1 billion digit files at 10 billion I can't even remember and generate a giant poster with every digit or maybe a book that has multiple pages so one thing you can do in processing pretty easily is render out a PDF hey it's pi day are you excited I'm excited on there's a bunch of stuff in the chat here I like that okay hold on hold on I don't know what's going on okay okay where am I here okay let's see all right just checkin my phone because that's the kind of thing I that's exactly how I roll okay officially turning this to airplane mode putting this away okay now so we're going to begin with this first first way of approximating the digital before I do this let's go to processing org now did it make it on to the website yet three point three point seven yes in honor of pi day three point three point seven which of all these things I want to three heat processing version 3.3.4 tie is a new release of processing we could I believe this this will take me to the release notes a roll up of several fixes Windows Defender blocks three point proof point six fixes to the net library new lines at the end of files rename refactor dialog so this by the way if you're curious this is where you can see all the things that have been change changed inversions of processing this is actually even though the this is called like semantic versioning our semver three point three point seven the point seven being minor changes the point three being media size changes and the three being major changes but the idea here is that in these like minor bug fixes that the API doesn't change the major things aren't broken so okay so but it's actually revision number 264 of processing that's there so let's download that processing if you're not familiar with it is a Java based environment I probably the majority of my videos and tutorials are using p5.js which is a JavaScript JavaScript Java Script where the emphasis is not on the script nobody says it that way JavaScript a JavaScript library for and I like to use that because it's easy to share stuff on the web but sometimes I just have a moment where I would like to use processing and today is one of those movements I also feel like with some of the things I want to do oh if I do a music challenge I might want to use JavaScript just because I have a bunch of p5.js sound examples already that would fit into that okay so let's open up processing let's minimize Ono and I can leave the browser I think I want I'm gonna need some browser windows let's put the code like this by the way there's a different date there's a I shouldn't be doing this today because there's a PI approximation day I forgot what day is pi approximation day major/minor patch yes thank you so some verse technically is your flashlight on on your phone it is it totally is thank you that's going to drain the battery like crazy I must have pressed that by accident major dot minor catch so a patch being a small fix a minor being a minor change or major being a major change okay semver semantic versioning okay how's this font size for you pi day one freaking adding fixing got it that's another way to think about it okay I'm being told that PI approximation day is July 22nd I hope to be like on vacation not making ice true but we'll see III probably what day of the week is that I'll probably be around okay so I need a good marker and I need to be able to draw a circle so what I'm going to do is talk about this approximation method can you hear the squeaking of the unicorn horn I'm going to talk about this approximation method which involves looking at the area of a square and the area of a circle and the ratio of those two is a way to approximate the value of well that's the way to actually calculate the exact value of pi but I can use a Monte Carlo like simulation you have people in the hallway don't really have a soundproof room here what you should do is just pick random numbers out of this random number book see what I want is this is a million random digits I want a book that's just like I'm gonna make this book I'm gonna make this book today I'm gonna print it and sell it I don't know if I'm just selling but I'll open source it I'm gonna make a book that is just ten million digits of pi or 1 billion digits of pi don't know how long it will need to be let's make that book today but first let me do my PI approximation Monte Carlo simulation thing ok here we go oops alright let me open up let me go to the hold on let me get though that's the ten million I really just want the 1 million digits hold on pi pi day let's go to the pi day org ok shop it's just like another is this just like Valentine's Day where this is basically just all made up to sell us hi phoebs merchandise no I used to have a tshirt I think it was a heaviest in high school that was something something is as easy as pie I think it was math this is gives me pie or something like that but instead of pie the symbol pi it was like this very complicated crazy formula that turned out to be PI all right uhhuh no I don't know why I buzz marketing the pi day shop but i would i wanted to do is go to pi day slash i would just want to have a nice yeah alright this will work actually hold on I got a better idea if you will bear with me for a second slash Schiffman / pi day alright let me very quickly clone this repo this will be a nice okay then let me just open up this code so this is actually implementing I'll talk about this later if I come back to it this isn'ta Banting a an algorithm created by plows Simon plows plows I'm gonna preempting it correctly this is actually this is some C code that came from Fabrice Ballard that I poured it to Java and then whoops why do I have oh my goodness this is not the hold your horses everybody why why why why why why am i holding this is the incorrect code you've already make everybody wait I have to push my changes I know why this is the wrong code what was it under Schiffman slash pi day what kind of do a coding challenge in a second I promise PI calc PI Kalki attit this file paste in the more recent file actually thing about it is I kind of am happy with this file this version let me just do this let me just run this let me just I don't need this okay this is actually not the version I want to run but that's fine let's see what this does okay so this is now this I'm going to come back to later let's just make a nice little window okay so you can see this here this is currently calculating all the digits of pi will go on forever this will in theory go on forever but it will start to get very very very very very very slow it's poor little laptop all right happy pi day everybody I don't know when you're watching this but today is March II T it's not March 14th or the 18th it would be pi day it's known as pi day because the first two digits of pi are three while the first digit is 3 then I'm gonna adopt endpoint then what let me just start over let's not have a video that has me say the wrong date as amusing as that might be to some of you hello happy pi day today is March 14 2018 I hope I am starting a new tradition to every pi day if I am still doing this next year to make some Pi Day themed coding challenges this is actually a processing program which I will come back and demonstrate in a different video that is calculating all the digits of pi one at a time and over time it's good slower and slower and slower anybody wants to doublecheck then it's the correct digits you could pause this right now go to PI day.org slash million and you'll be able to compare the numbers I Pro Phillipe i.org is the correct numbers but anyway March 14 3.14 but what I'm going to do in this particular video I don't know why I stopped it um what I'm gonna do in this particular video is show you a method for approximating the value of pi even though I probably should be doing this on July 22nd which is pi approximation day walk or walk out that's not a joke that's for real but I'm gonna do it today anyway so let me show you where this came from this thank you to a crowd 53 on github who suggested this particular idea also to the stem coding YouTube channel which I will link to in this video's description which has a video doing exactly the same methodology in JavaScript and okay so but let me just get right down to it so I'm gonna come back here and I'm gonna create this coding challenge in processing but let's talk about how it works oh hello okay so what is pi well this is first of all otherwise known as half tau for all of you who are already writing lots of things in the comments about how you prefer tau over pi if you're not familiar tau is really two pi hard are tau is talent pi is half mine anyway we have this idea of a circle I'm going to attempt to draw a circle a beautiful beautiful circle now you might have learned at one point in your life if you've taken a geometry class that there is a way a formula to calculate the circumference of a circle and it does a pretty poorly drawn circle but I did my best okay so what what is the length of this line all the way around the circle you know and one way that I could do that is I could get something you know I could get some tip like you know tape measure or string or something wrap it here that unwrap it and measure it precisely and what I would get if this is our whoops if this is our the radius of a circle is I would get the number 2 pi R so I can essentially calculate pi as equal to sorry I'm breaking when somewhere else I could calculate pi as equal to that length if I were to unfurl it that length divided by 2r so if I actually were to measure it and divide it by two R that would be the value of pi now if it so happened that this was 0.5 right we can see that the actual circumference is just pi and that's why we often refer there's this idea of tau I'm not gonna be able to write that up something like this which is just the full circumference it's kind of maybe a cleaner way you don't have to have that too but anyway I don't want to please don't let me down this rabbit hole of discussing five verses down I don't know why I'm doing this let's stop that for right now let's think about something interesting here all right here is a square let's say this Square has this same value R which is that right you can think of this square as the bounding box for this circle okay so the question is so this square is the bounding box for this circle what is the area of this square well we could say the area is this side the sort of height times the width and in this square the height and the width are both two times R so I could say two times R times two times R which would be four R squared okay so that is the area of this square what is the area of this circle well this is also a formula that we can pull from a geometry class it's interesting that it has a relationship to this formula which we which I would love to get into but it is PI R squared so we could calculate pi as a ratio of this square the area of this square to the area of this circle the ratio of the area of this square to this circle is 4r squared PI R squared in other words the R Squared's cancel each other out and the ratio of the area of a square that's the bounding box for a circle to the area of that circle itself is 4 over pi so if I say that ratio is 4 over pi then I can also say pi equals 4 divided by that ratio and if it's the ratio I'm saying I guess I should just done it the other way of saying the ratio of the area of the square of the area of the circle I could have said the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square and then I could say 4 times the ratio because I could flip it but that's neither here or there but what I'm going to do boy I'm not so if that is comfortable for you now imagine we have this idea I've talked about it before in other videos this idea of a Monte Carlo simulation and what do I need for a Monte Carlo simulation I need a book of random numbers imagine if I had you know I don't know little I guess darts is the the general thing if I if I could just throw little darts or little sticky things or something randomly at the wall what is the probability that one will land within the circle versus what is the probability that one will land within the square that is in fact going to imagine if we did that infinitely right the total number that would land within the square versus the total number that would land within the circle is in fact the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle so in that sense we can't do this infinitely we can't fill every instant decimal point we could of course with something known as calculus or some type of math and then actually calculate the the reveal value of pi and we've there's other ways to do that but I could get an approximation like if I just did 10 numbers you know ma'am you know just think about this for a second what if what if sorry what if I got to in the circle and one in the square so and and by the way the two that are in this the two that are in the circle are also in the square I'm terrible at explaining this I should have practiced this timeout I just need a break for a second have I done any of this camera went off have I done anything horribly wrong am i making sense call length see eta is the real circle constant Sunday July 22nd good font okay no I I don't see anything in this chat chat that's telling me I'm doing anything horribly wrong I do see someone saying why does he act so weird I wish I had an answer for that question I almost want to just like start over again because I feel like I explanation took so long because I wasn't really I didn't really have a plan for this did I get the right symbols for tau are you guys going hope said you're gonna be if I just start that whole explanation over because I kind of want to redo it with the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square I guess for it it would be I mean I guess it doesn't really matter I got the area of the square wrong circumference whole length see circumference that makes sense Taotao is correct okay yeah but I didn't really I didn't really wait to gosh what day is today my flash you guys are cows correct all right all right all right everybody square equals 4r squared which is what I got the area's correct all right so but all right I think I'm gonna um just for insanity sake if you don't mind I know this is kind of torture for you I want to give myself another shot at this because I feel the issue that I have with what I just did is that I think that I was a little just went on too long about various things and I would like to have as a record of this day a cleaner and more concise tutorial all right generalize it to an oval and make it fullscreen great suggestion everybody oh no but I now I have to do this and this I'm like lost my marbles here all right that's fine sorry everybody but I promise I don't know what I promise you know go take a break go outside have a cup a cup of tea breathe do some meditation up in about 10 minutes I'll be back to where I was or five minutes cuz it should be much shorter hello happy pi day I admit this is take number two I kind of messed up the first time I am going to do a coding challenge where I am going to approximate the value of pi now what's running here right now is the actual number pi I mean so what you fact check that this is correct you compare it to pi day org slash billion which I think had the first million digits of pi but this is a processing sketch using a particular algorithm to calculate all the digits of pi one at a time it will go on forever it will get very very very slow pretty quickly I will come back to this in a future video but what I'm gonna do in this video is is look at a way to approximate the value of pi now this came in as a suggestion from originally from a Kraus fiftythree on github for how to look at random particles that end up in a circle or outside of a circle interesting that's something to do with the area of the circle so I'm gonna diagram this out I should also mention thank you to the stem coding youtube channel and a stem coding project which has a ton of videos in various topics using programming and coding to teach different types of STEM related topics it's wonderful they have a video you can find a link to it in this in this video's description basically doing exactly the same thing that I'm about to try to do probably better but you know I'm gonna do my best if you'd give it my all and I'm gonna do this in processing which is a Java based programming environment if you're not familiar with it I'm sure I'll link to some video where I talk about what processing is okay we're gonna let this run and I'm gonna come over here to talk about a method that I'm going to use to approximate the digits of pi now there is something in our world known as a circle it is a beautiful round shape it is a shape that I'm not going to be able to draw but I'm going to attempt to I'm gonna move over here just give myself more room here is a circle now if you were to look up formula for circumference of a circle or you would find that it's equal to something called 2 pi R this is the formula for the circumference of a circle now what are these things well two is the number two R refers to the radius Center to the edge R this is the same length anywhere from the center of circle to any edge point and pi well this is this sort of magic number 3.1415926 that's all I can remember I might not even gotten to in the six right good we're gonna approximate it well here to see if we can get better than my memory tells me so how can I use this fact to calculate the number pi well one thing I could do is I could get a piece of string and I could wrap it around here in my perfect circle that he could undo the string I could get a tape measure I could measure it and then whatever that is if I knew the value of R I could solve for the value of pi that would work I should mention by the way just because I know someone's gonna say something in the comments and it's not today today is not towel day I'll come back and do this with tau but tau is a number the Greek letter tau or tau PI being spelled with English letters or Roman letters P I is essentially well pi is half tower tau is 2 pi I don't know I don't want to get into which one is which but this is often used because then we could say the circumference is just tau R but there anyway this opens up a big can of worms that I don't want to go down so I'm not gonna do this string method let's look at another two formulas from geometry so so one thing is what's the formula for the area of this circle well how's it it looks quite similar and there's a special relationship there that's a topic for another time but PI R squared so PI R squared is the area of this circle now let's think of thing what if I put a square as a bounding box in that circle a perfect square I can draw that over here with this idea of our being here so the sides of this square are twice the length of our the area of the square is the width of a rectangle as the width times the height a square just being the side squared so the area so this is the area of the circle the area of the square is 4 4 2 times 2 is 4 R squared so look at that 4 R squared PI R squared now imagine something there's a relationship here right there's a relationship between the area of a let's say the area of the circle to the area of the square that relationship can be expressed as a ratio I could say the area of the circle PI R squared the area of the square for R squared the RS cancel out the ratio is pi divided by 4 or I could say that pi equals 4 times that ratio in a way but what do I mean by this exactly what I mean well who I say here why are we even here how am I going to use this to approximate so in the in the original github post it said well simulate it with physics so we could imagine one physic scenario is throwing darts what if I were to just throw random darts on the wall at the wall well that would go all over the place some darts would land within the square but not in the circle and some darts would land within the circle but not within the square so in a way I can kind of imagine the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square as the number of darts that land within the circle divided by the number of darts that have landed in the square now three have landed in the circle and four have landed in the square so I could say pi in this case pi is approximately four times the circle count divided by the square count which is equal to 3 divided by 4 4 times 3 divided by 4 is what 3 so there is my approximation of pi 3.0 so that's right I mean it's not very good but only through four darts the more darts that I throw the more and if I did this infinitely if I filled this the more darts that I throw the more darts that I throw if I did this infinitely and fill the entire space I would get closer and closer and closer to a better approximation of the number pi so this is what I'm going to implement in code now I really really want to just use for my dart throwing the numbers from this million random digits book I'm tempted to use the random org API which gives but I think I probably just use the processing random function which is a pseudorandom generator that's another topic but that I will come back to okay so let's go over the code did I say Roman oh did I fix the equation oops what's wrong with the equation no this this is supposed to this is okay sorry yes so actually before I go to the code I wrote this in such a weird way what I mean is four times the circle count over the square count is equal sign was sort of a problem there I'm replacing the circle count with three the square count with four so it's four times three over four and that's how I get three apologies for that did I say Roman letters Roman letters I think I meant Latin Latin alphabet or the Roman alphabet that's kind of the same thing I guess some missing the letters J and U and W were added at a later stage I don't know is that okay I was just trying to look look where we are here we're still getting some digits all right we'll have to leave in the B things okay so lemme let me come back to the code I just want to see here sketch okay great all right do that again that's you will edit this later I'm glad I did that over I think that was better alright so I'm back in the code look at this we're still getting digits of pi here bro slowly over time I'm fortunate I'm gonna stop this program and I'll be running again later and I'm gonna go to a blank sketch whoops I'm just to close this and I'm gonna go to a blank sketch okay so what are the first things that I need to do let's create a window that's 400 by 400 let's give it a background of zero yeah zero that's fine stroke 255 then let's call the ellipse function at and let's I think life our life might be easier if I just do translate to the center to put the zero zero at the center yeah why not and so the ellipse is going to be at 0 0 with a radius a radius of 200 the ellipse function expects a diameter so the radius is 200 the diameter is 400 and then we're gonna do we're gonna say I'm gonna say no fill and I'm going to say rectangle also 0 0 400 400 and let's say stroke wait for whoa Oh Rex mode and I wanna say rekt mode Center okay and let's make the size actually a little bit bigger so I can sort of see the outline now here's the thing I kind of have a I kind of have a crazy idea so here's the thing I am I for me to calculate whether it's inside the circle or not use PI and I kind of for some weird reason I want this code to not use Pi at all I mean there's a distance function and processing that I could use which ultimately which behind the scenes uses actually no no it doesn't use I don't have to use pi hmm no I don't have to use a pot oh yes I do the distance oh no no that doesn't function use it the Pythagorean theorem scratch that so I'm gonna be fine ok nevermind so what I do is I want to fill this I want to fill this window we maybe we could add that could possibly edited out my tía that random people don't want me to edit these videos too much so whatever anyway I get what I want to do now is I want to start throwing the darts so I'm gonna use the Processing's random number function which is random and I'm gonna say right here I'm gonna do this at the end let's do this at the end of draw draw is a loop that happens over and over again if you haven't used processing before and this is the java programming language with extra set of functionality for drawing x equals random i'm just saying and let's let's actually let's make a variable a global variable called R which is equal to 200 so I'm gonna say R times 2r times 2r times 2r times 2 I'm gonna make a random number between negative R and R and a Y which is a random number between negative R and R then I'm going to draw a point at that X Y so let's do our dart throwing okay look at that so one thing is I'm getting something starry flickering thing so I really want to just draw this in setup as kind of the initial background and then I don't want to redraw the background again but I think I probably will need the translate in both places there we go so now you can see I am filling the space with dots so now what I need to figure out as I need to count the dots that are well I know the total dot and actually all of the dots I don't have to test if dots are within the square because I've set this up in such a way that it basically can only create dots that are within the square so what I need to do is determine how many dots are within the circle so let me do this I'm gonna say if R if so first I need to get the distance what is the distance between 0 0 and X Y so this is how far from the center is that point to be honest i weirdly in all every case of life I would use the distance function but some reason right now I feel like it's worth noting that pi is not being used here that the distance function is actually using the Pythagorean theorem because if I know the x offset from the center and the y offset from the center then this hypotenuse of this right triangle x squared plus y squared equals H squared eighth best Pythagorean theorem H is the square root of x squared plus y squared so I I kind of want just for the some weird arbitrary sense of purity to say square root of x times X plus y times y and if that distance is less than less than or equals or just less than let's say less than mmm this is just an approximation anyway less than R I'm going to say stroke stroke let's make it a greenish color okay here we go otherwise stroke 255 here we go oops and I need another curly bracket here we go so we can see now and let's let's make it a I don't know I'm gonna pick some arbitrary colors that are gonna not look very nice I'm gonna do my best and here we go so we have two different colors we have this kind of Greek ooh I pick colors that are quite similar so I write I could by the way I could do this without randomness I could just check all of the pixels but I like I like the random method and let me let me make these colors quite a bit more different there we go so we can see I've got some blue ones and you can see if they're on the line you know depending on where they are because I have a stroke width of two they're either blue or green so that could use some finesse in the chat the live chat that's going on I see someone's asking what is float float is the datatype so unlike in JavaScript which a lot of my other tutorials in I would just say let X or var X or context depending on how I feel London begins a float is a floating point decimal number okay now so now we need to do is we need to count so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say I'm gonna say I'm gonna say I'm gonna use an integer total equals zero and int circle equals zero so this is going to be total it's going to mean the total number of dots circle is going to be the number of dots that are in the circle and what I'm going to do is I am going to say now I'm going to look back at my formula write pi equals four times the total number of circle divided by the total number of total so pi and I'm going to say P ie just not to be confused with the actual there is a constant called pi that's available in processing I guess I could do lowercase PI processing wouldn't but I'll just say PI because pi is delicious pi equal that's really like gonna be upset people float pi equals 4 times circle divided by total and let's put those in parentheses just for fun now here's the thing there's a couple problems with this number one total I don't want total to be zero it will never be zero because I'm going to immediately say total plus plus like as soon as I pick a point I'm increasing so at least the first time it runs through this total will be one and then of course if it's within the radius circle is plus plus and so let me say print line pi so let's just look it let's run this and see what we get I keep getting a zero why do I get zero I don't get anything so this has to do with integer arithmetic so integer math these are both integers circle and total so even if I say 10 divided by 20 that's 0 remainder remainder 10 or 20 divided by 19 divided by 20 is 0 remainder 19 so it's always going to give me the 0 so I need to explicitly convert one of these to a float I think I might change this to double to for more precision but this should now give me you can see here I am slowly and slowly getting closer and closer perhaps to the value of pi' let's let this run for a little bit so so I'm reading oh I lost the chat yeah Roman alphabet okay good that's so the question is am i getting though this will be added out am I getting numbers that are a little bit too high through randomness or is my or dual its float just gonna send me in the wrong like what's the reason why as though let's come back here all right okay I'm back I've let this run for just a couple minutes you can see that I'm not really I had some kind of getting something that looks kind of like pie I'm a little bit higher than pie so I'm to ask myself the question what's going wrong here well my one guess that I have is that I haven't been so exactly thoughtful about my distance check that maybe that that like sort of border of what's on the line versus not on the line is something that I need to think about more deeply the resolution is it's kind of an issue there but the other issue might be just the way that floating point math works in the Java programming language I might need a different data structure data type that allows me for sort more precision so hold on I'll be right back I'm going to make some adjustments in the code okay let's take a look let's see if we can think about this well look at this beautiful drawing by the way so the question is is let's let's just change this to this for a second because it should be okay if it is I would think it's okay if it's equal yeah a hundred loop okay yeah yeah ditch the drawing randomness it's closer okay should it here's my question is it technically correct for it to be equals or not equals I don't think it's not it's technically I mean here's the thing we're not gonna we're not gonna pick a point that's exactly point zero zero zero zero so I think it's actually not gonna make a difference but I don't think I think equals it's not within the area right yeah infinitely small amount so I'm gonna leave that alright so okay well one issue is so look at this nice drawing first of all one issue is certainly that I'm spending all this time drawing just to get like one point at a time 30 frames or 60 frames per second so one thing I can absolutely do is there's no reason why I couldn't just put a little for loop in here and say hey let's do a hundred points per frame and what I'm going to do I don't want what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let's make a PI a variable outside of that loop just so when the loop finishes I can take a look at what the value of pi is so now I can do a hundred points at a time and you can see how much faster this is sort of filling up the drawing and we can now go look and see what have I got here yeah so I think I think we just have a lot of randomness here and now I'm getting 3.14 when it's you know we're converging it as best we can so I think we've done a pretty good job at approximating pi think maybe I could actually be done a couple things that people noted one is I could actually get rid of the square root from this program and just look at rsquared that could be my comparison that's gonna square root is very slow expensive calculation I could fix some white space here another thing that I could do is let's just try this with like ten thousand and see what we get pretty good birthday birthday birthday pie all right thank you everybody this is meat oh no no no no let's let's go a little step further let's use doubles so what is a double a double so as you know any numbers that we have in a program yeah and and and and the of stroke weight stroke weight yes okay okay I'm getting good getting good good good points here all right let's see if using double actually does anything so what is a double so processing natively actually doesn't really support the double data type any number that you have in a variable is stored in memory and so floating point numbers there's an infinite amount of decimal numbers between any two integers but we don't have an infinite amount of memory on our computer so we allow locate a certain number of bits so floating points allocate a certain number of bits doubles allocate more so if we really need to do precise mathematics and then there's other Java classes and implications for really big numbers but let's at least change this to double let's change this to double and I'm gonna I'm gonna have to use casting because double is not and I'm gonna change this you're just going to change this to double as well I'm gonna be really I'm gonna overdo it I don't need to I think I need to change all of these but now I should see that this and by the way I don't need to calculate it I don't know why I did that I can just calculate it once there and I wrote float and let's make this double okay so now let's take a look at this and one thing we can see is already there are more digits appearing in the print line statement and maybe maybe I think that just so much randomness that's part of this that ultimately ultimately I'm not so sure that we're gonna get much anything that's really that accurate out of this method but it is nice to see we've consistently got one point for one now which is right if only we could get a five here one point four one five let's see we get a five here come on get a five five five consistently so maybe over time as we do this over and over again now one thing might be it may be look at make could we make this drawing any prettier I mean one thing that I might choose to do is make a stroke wait that's actually more like it's actually at that's more like point one so a very light stroke maybe you can't see that it also makes a stroke weight of one but maybe give some alpha so some transparency there we go this I don't know it's kind of interesting looks kind of like I'm looking under a microscope I'm gonna let this run for a while and I'll just be back in a couple minutes to check where it got to okay so one thing my back my back so I could try to be more precise about this oh I don't think that's gonna matter though because these are all going to be oh no wait hi sorry oh the camera enough anyway boy that made a mess of this I actually I'm back because I got a good comment from the chat which is that I could choose to try to make this test a bit more precise so I could make this a double I could cast the X as a double and again I'm gonna just overdo it and cast everything so let let's take a look at let's let's cast all those as doubles and let's run this one more time we can see it filling up here and it seems to be running at a perfectly reasonable frame rate so I'm actually gonna try to do this ten thousand times per frame well now it's a little bit slow so I cut I want my animation to be fast oh that was that was a hundred thousand let's just go with ten thousand okay so let's take a look okay I'll be back in a minute let's see how many digits we can kind of get and see how close we're doing all right let's let's let this run for a while to see if it converges at all because those numbers over time should get very very big yeah of course I should store R times R as a variable so unfortunately the processing random function won't give me a double won't give me a double natively yeah could also save the best one yeah yes okay that's a great suggestion all right I got an idea all right hey then back again so you can see this kind of algorithm it's not gonna converge very quickly there's a lot of noise in it from the randomness but one thing I could do to add to this program is try to keep track of which one is the best so there is in Java natively let's let me take out this print line for a second and what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna say print line so processing natively has the constant pi but Java also has the constant pi that is in the math package so let me look at both of those and you can see that that one is a double so this is the actus is actually what's stored is not that many digits in math dot Pi in Java so what I'm going to do is I am going to create I'm gonna create a variable called record pi and I am going to set record PI equal to zero just as its initial value I don't need to set it down there I'm sorry I can just set it up here then what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at double the difference between math dot pi minus record pi and let's take the absolute value of that and I also need to oh can I guess I have to do math dot absolute for because I have doubles so I'm gonna take the difference between matha pi and the record pi then so this is actually really the record difference then I'm going to look at the difference between the PI I just calculated my Oh math dot pi minus the PI I just calculated so if if the difference is less than the record difference if we've gotten one that's closer then the difference is now the record difference is now the difference and the record PI why did I use an underscore did I use an underscore that's sort of unnecessary record pi equals zero and then record PI then record PI is that new pi and what I could do is whenever I have a new record I could print out record PI so let's take a look and see what I get in the console there and in a way I kind of want to do that every time because I feel like I should give it a chance this is not a big calculation to do I might as well do this every single time even though I'm only drawing every so often so let's put all this inside of this loop and let's run it and we can see the this is now currently the record one point four one five nine two six hey I know I don't know like how many digits have I gotten correct pausing for a second see if we get anything better so what's alright so let's go look at the actual digits of pi so I'm gonna go to PI day.org / million and I don't need that many of them this is gonna be plenty just the first line here let's open up TextEdit let's put this in here and let's make this a little bit bigger let's go back to the processing sketch oops let's bring this down here how many did it so I have and let's take a look and compare so so far we have gotten one is correct 4 is correct one is correct five is correct nine is correct two is correct six is correct five is correct my font size is not the same ah have I gotten as close as I can get no no this is wrong 6 is correct 5 is correct 3 is correct ah okay so I'm just gonna give myself a couple minutes to take a short break and I'll come back and see if anything got a little closer why not just rip the difference I could do that I should plot it converging definitely should plot it as a new number popped up I don't think it has yeah I could use math dot random know the so tone in the chat is asking the size is 400 to our is 200 is that messing things up it's not messing things up because I still have drawn the I'm I am picking the random numbers using just are so I'm not using the width and height of the screen that's just a little extra space to draw which is silly and unnecessary now we still have this four here we're not able to get a five yeah alright so I'm gonna wrap this up alright thanks for watching this coding challenge there are so many ways this could be improved you could sort of plot the difference you could visualize these numbers and kind of like highlight which digits are correct which are incorrect there's so many you could think about how you're drawing this you could get your you could make the random numbers double that you're picking I don't know if that would really help you could use my favorite website random orbit as an API for random numbers is really not gonna make your program run faster but there is so much that you could try to do so if you make something with this coding challenge please share it with me in the comments below you can also go to the coding train com website there's a place where you could link to your shared version I will also release a JavaScript version of this that you can run in the browser and maybe actually that's a might be an easier way to also display the results so thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed this pi day coding challenge so lots of there's lots of questions in the chat have I made any horrible errors I don't think so if difference is greater than the record this difference so only thing that I'm keeping globally is the record PI and yeah is the record PI so I calculate the record difference yeah ok yeah I'm gonna don't worry I'm gonna do more it's only 1220 right now I'm gonna do something that this can't be it for today so somehow I spent an hour and 20 minutes doing this and my intention was for this to be like a 20 minute video hopefully it will get edited down up so I need to remember yeah PI from processing is a float but I'm didn't use PI from processing I'm using math PI yeah Oh a new number printed I got better we got cool a new number printed that's exciting now we just need to get a nine there I mean actually it's not that we need to get a nine here it's not necessarily gonna make it closer like if this were like an eight or a nine that would be getting a closer right it's just that like I want the number to match but you have to remember these are the you're not more correct based on which digits are equal here's more correct based on the actual difference between the two yes so there are all these interesting sequences and things let me save this okay so a couple things one I'm going to do is so in order to try to relief the edited version of this today I'm gonna hit stop recording so I'm no longer recording to disc and I'm gonna go open up my Google Drive here and I'm gonna upload that video file that I just recorded because I think not just gonna try to add this so even in like very soon I might release the edited version of I mean very soon being at some point today so it comes out on pi day let me go to preferences sorry I have to do this for a second you can listen to this dots off so just give me a moment here March 14th is today and I am now uploading the recorded version of this hopefully this is not going to mess with my streaming bandwidth and then I'm also going to clear some space on this hard drive all right so now I am uploading whoa I did something weird whoa something weird is happening I'm downloading all these files why am i downloading all these files sorry everybody if they're still in echo it's just an echo and I'm playing the music the echo is because I can is I can oh I know I D echos there I forgot about this issue because I changed the sound before this should help a little bit now there should be no echo I can't hear the music though okay no I think I'm okay now I just need to clear some harddrive space there an echo now is there an echo now Rasmus Toland in the chat rightz the PI you calculated has a precision of one point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero three to seven which is pretty good I think so too I forgot oh I've got a new number no we still owe we gotten a baby I think we got a new number but it's we've still got this digit these digits this needs to go to an 8 mega needs to go to a 9 so pretty good okay so let me think now what am I gonna do next I would like to do something visual so first of all I should have printed this out I would like to read to you some digits of pi normally I would read from my book of a million random digits instead I would like to read to you from a book of Pi if somebody would like to songify this for me it would bring me great joy 3.14159265 three five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six two six four three three eight three two seven nine five zero two eight eight four one nine seven one six nine three nine nine three seven five one zero five eight two zero nine seven four nine all right and then you can use some kind of magic computer program thing right because I could just say zero one zero one two three four five six seven eight nine you can chop all those up and then I could say all the digits of pi forever and ever think I have a couple different versions like zero one two three four five six seven eight nine zero one two three four five six seven eight nine all right all right I definitely could not do it with a blindfold all right so those you know I forgot to hit record I actually I wasn't recording this to disk that's fine though it will be in the YouTube Pantheon forever and ever okay now I'm recording to disk again now what I would like to do is make some visualizations based on pi and let me look at the ten million digits that's a billion I don't I don't think I'm that's a gigabyte file I don't thing I'm gonna do anything with the O first I since I was saying today is a fundraiser for the lower Eastside girls donated anything halfmarathon this Sunday I did get a donation thank you thank you to Peter Carrero from $25 I will read Peter Carrero some more digits of pi no one's gonna want to donate cuz it will just be here read more digits of pi these digits of pi are dedicated oh I know I am at 675 so let's go and find 675 appears at the 576 digit of pi thank you to fathom information design and so I will now read these digits of pi dedicated to peter carrera who gave a nice donation to the ilaria site girls club thank you six seven two five two three eight four six seven four eight one eight four six seven six oh yeah numberphile has a video called pi is beautiful which goes through a bunch of different visualizations so let's make something so I want to get let's get the ten million digits of pi and let's save this to the desktop and how big is that that file is just ten megabytes that's no problem I'm gonna hit save I'm gonna do save as pi day to let us get that 10 million digits file and what I'm gonna do is oh wait I'm gonna do a coding challenge okay so oh yeah six seven five appears it's a five seven six whoa well let's go back and look at that again 675 these sound effects are Piggly Lane yeah that's crazy I did not know that I did not check that on purpose we have found more beauty in the number pi than we could ever imagine Wow alright what's going on here in this mug of tea alright so now we're going to do another Pi Day themed coating challenge I will mention again if you feel so inclined this pie de pie day is dedicated I you know I didn't intend for this to happen obviously but this live stream is dedicated to the great late Stephen Hawking who died today on pi day but what my intention was was this also to be a fundraiser for a wonderful organization that I like to support which is just a small number of blocks from here Laurie side Girls Club I'm running a half marathon on Sunday raising money for them if you feel so inclined please donate I'll match any donations that come in through super chat give them to the lower Eastside Girls Club okay thank you now alright so I have this alright so let me at least type in set up and draw the one that I kind of liked visually which I think might be interesting to try I mean I hate to I don't really love the idea of copying somebody else's design up certainly would want to credit them and I wouldn't make it as beautiful as them let's see if any new issues have come in that aren't labeled it doesn't look like it okay so I can go to the pi day label oops not completed pied a label and what I'm looking for is this one I really like this this the one that I like whoa okay how look scary City skyline search or search for words is a really interesting one let's visualize aspects that make up pie oh I just look at that one what's wrong with me turtle graphics and just this will not work unfortunately at least the way that I'm that I'm thinking about it we'd like to come back to that to see if there's a way draw a circle with pie numbers this is the one yeah so this is a this image is created by an artist is this the Kootenay I thought the name of the artist started with an M oh it is also Albert Einstein's birthday today hi dais an interesting day certainly for for sure we're let's look at pi is beautiful on a number file which I think has links to this artist and I yes Christian Leo's vos heels so let's let's go to there should be a link to I thought there was a link to I guess this this will do the art of Pi yes science art okay and so the one that I'm thinking of is circular art yes here we go I just want to make sure I so anyway this is an interesting one distribution of the first so I what I'm trying to think of progression and transition so I'm trying to think of what is a way that I can you know one way would just be to like visualize them on a grid and just like with a color for each digit oh look at that so so that one that you sent Alka that's also from Christian vassal I know if I'm pronouncing the name correctly Christian Vasile how is that one done because it looks like there's a difference there's a different there's it's not just like nine the other you know the other thing I like is making a polygon with a certain number of sides based on the digit which is kind of fun visualized on a pie find pie in pie made with circo's I don't know what that means so I'm trying to think of what's a simple way of visualizing it well we could do frequency so I like the idea of something simple so let's do something simple and let's just do frequency I think that'll be interesting to try so I want it like let's find Christian vassula let's is this that's a Romanian singer a visual art okay ten studying images show that beauty hidden in pie yeah whoo I love this one this is from Martin Krasinski artist by accident yeah so this one yeah well look at all these alright so this is good set of inspiration I won't make anything that's nice so I think we can I'll calculate pi on a Raspberry Pi alright so we're gonna do something to visualize pi and we have a data file that has 10 million digits which is way more than we need oh I don't want to open that data file up I kind of want to just quickly make that into a data file that has 1 million digits so let me quickly do that so I'm going to go to I'm gonna say up high equals load strings was it pi what was it called PI 10 million I just think it'll be a little easier to work with a 1 million we just test this out oh I don't know what I'm doing here string so I just want to say print line pi dot length did it load it into just one yep so there's just one thing so pi is the first element there so this is giving to me pi and then what I want to do is say pi equals PI dot substring 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 and then I want to say output is a string array with one thing in it output index 0 equals now PI then I want to say save strings PI 1 million dot txt so this should if I'm right this is a quick little program Oh output okay so this is a quick little program what I'm doing here is I'm loading all 10 million digits into a string and load strings in processing loads everything into an array but there's just one element to the array so I just want the first element array then I want to get just the first million digits hopefully that's million and then put that in an output array and save that to another text file okay so I think this will be exclusive so I want zero through nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine which i think is correct so let's let's run this and I probably should have and we should say I now have a file called PI 1 million which is just one megabyte and TextEdit will have a much easier time opening that up great so I can take a look at that where these numbers correct earlier yeah they look right ok all right yeah I'm going to ignore three in the dot though three in the dot aren't in that file and I'm gonna ignore them okay all right so so if I wanted to I could say this that would give me the full string but so let's do something visual with them I have an idea okay and okay all right ready everybody oh good that went out hello and happy pi day part 2 I'm gonna do another coding challenge and this coding challenge will be about visualizing the digits of pi so I'm gonna use a file that I've prepared of 1 million digits of pi I also will include links in this video's description to a file with 10 million digits and a file I think that has a billion digits I can't remember which one I found but various people have posted files with a lot more digits that I'm gonna use so you might be interested in trying it out with even more digits cuz boy let's just make as many digits as we can now this is inspired by two artists I'm sure I'm gonna polish for mispronouncing the names but Martin Chris Nowinski and Christian ba ba SIL who have made Christian Ile Elise Vasile who have made a whole lot of beautiful images visualizing the digits of pi so I encourage you to check out this Washington Post article I'll link to that there's also a wonderful numberphile video called the beauty of Pi or something like that that I will link to that goes through some of their visualizations I'm gonna try to do something really simple so let's get started by loading those digits so first what I want is I actually want to have a string because I want to take all the digits of pi and put them in a string although ultimately maybe I'll break that into an array of integers but that's how they're gonna come in they're coming in from a text file so I'm gonna call it pi just P I lowercase I don't want to say P I uppercase because that's a builtin constant in processing let's just arbitrarily have a window that's 400 by 400 then I'm gonna say pi equals load strings so load strings is a function that's part of processing this is processing by the way Java based programming environment that what it actually does is it loads and I have a file it's right here PI 1 million dot txt you can see those are a lot of digits in that file so I just need to reference the file name here we go file name now what this actually I'm getting an error here and what is that error that error is mismatched Java dot lang dot string bracket bracket does not match with Java dot laying dot string the reason why this doesn't match is the processing load strings function takes in your data into an array and this is actually often quite useful especially if you have data in multiple lines because it takes every line from the text file and breaks it into an array but this text file just has one line so I can actually just take zero just the first element to that array and I'm gonna say print line pi just to see if this appears in the console oh boy I'm gonna freak it out because it should be a million digits there let's say PI dot length to make sure I have a million digits oh oh I forgot in the Java length for a string is a function I was like whoa I'm so used to programming in JavaScript in Java length for the string as a function so I'm gonna say dot length and there we go I've got one million digits of pi we're cooking here now we're cooking okay so let's actually break that into an array so let me make an array called digits which has 1 million spots in it and I wonder if actually actually I don't need to initialize it because I think I can say string I'll call it f digits equals PI dot split and if I give it know if I say split with no delimiter so this is like splitting the string but splitting it based on no delimiter this should give me an array with a million strings in it so I should be able say let's just see s digits not lengths this is an array so with an array I don't need the parentheses because it's not a function it's actually just the property of the array let's look at that 1 million 1 million yeah so I've got a million and now I can and then again this is not necessary the most efficient way I can actually just I think processing has a function called int which will just convert that array entirely into integers so now if I say print array and I probably am going to overload the console here but I'm gonna do it anyway I'm gonna hit save and I'm gonna run it I now have a look at this I am now printing the entire million digits of pi into the console just try loading the billion digits and pretty to the console see how long it takes what am i up to I'm gonna get to I'm gonna get to a million before I finish talking there we go you can see on that last digit there is one okay so now I have all these digits what can I do so many things right I could just fill the screen with all the digits and I could be surrounded by the digits of pi now I mean either way I almost want to stop this now and say hey be creative make something I think what I'm going to try to do is visualize the frequency of the digits so let's just actually make a simple line right let's say there are 10 digits so I'm gonna go I equals 0 so I'm gonna make I'm gonna make an array called counts and as 10 spots in it okay and so and then I'm going to also have an integer which is like current digit which will equal 0 so the first thing that I actually current index I'll just call that index because what I want to say is current digit equals PI digits index and then I'll go to the next index I got to worry about when I get to a million I'll deal with that later right so I could look at the current digit then I could I have made something called counts already and I could say counts current digit plus plus so I'm going to increase the count for each current digit and then what I will do is let's just draw a little let's go let's start with x equals zero I say let's use I I equals 0 I is less than counts dot length I plus plus and I could do a little math here I can say the width is the width of the window divided by count length and so that's X is going to equal I times width and Y is going to equal just a height divided by two so I'm just going to draw something in the middle how about an ellipse and I probably should offset it by half the width so X comma Y and I'm just gonna draw some circles oh boy let's get rid of that console that print line that's gonna be a problem apologies everybody and I probably should make a smaller file data file to work with while I'm developing this but you can see now I just got a whole bunch of circles now what I want to do is actually let me make the size of the circle the size of the circle relative to the the number of digits there are so counts index I why is that giving me an error float does not match with int that's fine let's can let's make this an int so the more times oh this is this should be an int that's that's my problem the index into the array as to be an int I don't know why I put a float there this can be a float because it can convert it so now if I do this what we're seeing is every time it finds one of those digits it's growing that circle now they're just gonna go bigger and bigger and you can see well the distribution is somewhat even have I really discovered anything interesting here I'm not so sure let's put these in the path of a circle that'll be more interesting so first of all let me give this a background here and let's think about this so okay so let's actually make let's think about polar coordinates for a second so I'm going to say angle equals map I which goes from zero to count's length to between zero and two pi pi is appearing now right I want to get an angle all the way around a circle and then I want my X to be some radius so like let's say let's say 200 in this case 200 times cosine of that angle and this is me converting from polar coordinates an angle and a radius to Cartesian coordinates I have a video about that that I will link to if is unfamiliar territory to you y equals 200 times sine of that angle so and then let's also translate to the middle of the window because I want to I want to offset everything from the center of the window and let's take a look and see what this gives us so now you can see I am now put them all around them this is this is this is digit 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so I've I have I have normalized in the past zero so I don't know if this size is really that interesting one of the one of these artworks if I scroll down here actually what it does and this it doesn't in a more sophisticated way is it's connecting digits to the next digit that would be super interesting to try let's try that so I actually need to look at the next digit in this case right so I don't need to worry about this counts stuff I actually don't even need to worry about this loop thing okay hold on let's let's figure this out let's so let me save this I'm gonna say this as pi day 3 because I'm gonna I'm gonna rip this apart now for a second so let me let me take this out let me get rid of all this count stuff and let me say digit equals digits index and then let me say next digit equals digits index plus 1 so I'm going to look at each digit and the next digit now what I'm going to do is I'm going to say angle 1 equals and I might as well use the math function digit which goes between 0 and 10 between 0 and 2pi I could precompute all these locations angle 2 is next digit so now I just need to do that polar to Cartesian transformation again again I'm going to say 200 times cosine of angle 1 y1 equals 200 times sine of angle 1 I'll do the same thing for X 2 and y 2 sine of angle 2 cosine of angle 2 and now what if I draw a line from X 1 X 2 to y 1 y 2 so this is me looking at every digit the next digit mapping those points taking those points around a circle and connecting them let's see what this does beautiful guess what the default stroke for a line in processing is black so let's make the stroke 255 okay so this is working I think let's uh let's make the window a little bit bigger so that there is let's draw a nice let's put move background to setup and let's draw a little circle also so let's say stroke 255 let's grab the translate here also and let's say no fill I just want to draw a little circle so we can see that path and I'm going to say 0 0 200 200 that 200 should definitely be a variable and let's try this again oops so the size of the circle is 400 400 right because it's the width so what have I done wrong here why are these points around a square pattern and hold on pause for a second what do they do wrong here these should be Oh with divine no that's fine am I using width and height somewhere else everything's from the center why are these points not on the edges of the circle something is wrong here that I'm not seeing the line function oh my goodness look at this probably everybody has been yelling at me when you watch this whole video the lines aren't totally the wrong place x1y1 to x2y2 the line function takes the first point and the second point and this is all messed up okay so now let's run this again there we go so now you can see that I am filling up the space now honestly all it kinda looks like is everything is connected to everything which of course is the case so maybe what I need to do is think about color think about blending think about those positions there so but you're seeing here some interesting possibilities here so I haven't really made anything so beautiful that wasn't the point of me making this video the point of me making this video was to show you how to load all the digits of pi how to iterate over them and how to start thinking about drawing based on them and if you look through and read this Washington Post article or think creatively on your own I am sure you will come up with your own pie drawing so please share pie train uno hashtag pie train on twitter go to the coding train comm and submit your there's a there'll be information there at the page for this coding challenge of how to submit your version of it share it with me on Twitter share it with me in the comments I would love to see your visualization of all of the digits of pi yeah so in the chat I'm being told oh add some randomness Oh randomness to those locations that would certainly help I guess I could do that before I leave I mean I'm not going anywhere but like I could and Gaussian random this might be nice but like what if I just say oh today it's a sorry let's add a little bit of randomness each time actually the randomness should be in between whatever the the difference between each angle is so hold on the difference between two angles is 2pi divided by 10 so I want to pick something random in between there let's try that let's try that just to get a little something and then let's make this stroke wait stroke let's give it like some alpha and now we can see I don't know whether I've made anything better necessarily but but you can see this is like a variation on this theme so you you the viewer of this video are a more creative visually talented person than I am that I am sure of so I don't want to go too far of this I'm not adding any color I'm not being thoughtful about those positions the circular idea is just one idea a grid is another idea somebody suggested making a skyline based on the digits of pi there's so many designs that you can think about making based on the digits of pi and another thing that I'm gonna do in the next video is look at how to think about scale so this is me just making it in a processing sketch but what if I want to it does kind of look like the moon which is pretty interesting what if I want to render out the digits of pi to a giant high resolution poster so I'm gonna look at that in the next coding challenge thank you oh yeah this is incorrect this should really be like alright no no I got it right okay the original one is remembering the count of the digit N and then moving down the amount of the arc allocated to that digit oh that's interesting did you watch the three one Braun videos that a new video from today I did not if I you did let's take a look at this again goodness hi moon this is the here this is hereby referred to as the pie moon the question I have is just to be clear about this I think why this isn't so interesting I mean is that like if I just say this actually what would be interesting I said I have to blow my nose hey would be the count immediately the count how many times the digit appears the same digit in sequence thank you oh sorry for your ears there digit like in other words if I just do this right if I just pick random digits you know I really am I gonna have anything that really is the set is that different let this run for a minute so one thing I want to do now and it's a little bit silly for me to do this in processing perhaps is I want to make the book of Pi so that question is like can you really tell the difference between this where I'm just picking random digits or not but I do feel like that was enough to instigate some creativity add the index map down from zero to a million to zero to two pi divided by 1000 that's interesting so okay I don't know why I'm all sniffily all of a sudden alright so what I want to do now I'm gonna leave that as is the point of what I'm doing again is not to is not to make something beautiful but to kind of give people the beginning steps okay so let's do pi day for um so what I want to do now mmm at one point I'm just looking here eleven okay so let's make something that's 1150 I'm by 800 pixels will not show up oh that's landscape I mean I'm an 800 by 1150 that will not show up so what I want to do now is make the book of Pi and I can leave it as a string okay and I'm gonna get rid of draw and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to processing dotorg library's reference but a PDF export the only thing about this single frame multiple pages this is what I want next page yeah this is what I want but let me do a single page first which this is the easiest way to do it I the way that I usually do it is with this begin record and record because I want this screen display no screen display I want the screen display can I do multiple pages with begin record and record what's the next page PDF next page can I still get this and do next page so I just want to test something what I want to do let me just test something forget about this for a second I want to do is I want to say I just want to understand how this works before I do the challenge begin record book of Pi then I want to say and I also want to get the renderer and render it doesn't need the import the library this is a renderer not exist if I'm using begin record let's see this might work I wonder if I need to say it afterwards let's do this let's say it's just say line 0 0 with height then what I want to say is PDF next page I'm gonna say line with comma zero so let's say background zero now let's say background 0 with 0 0 height stroke let's see if I can do multiple pages and screen display and then I want to say then I think I say end record so sniffily ok let's see if this works no so I think I can only do the next page thing if I use this let's see if this will do it require a path so I could make the poster of Pi I'm not gonna see I guess I could just so now I don't need I don't need to begin record and I don't eat and record let's just even see if this works well I think I need to say exit ok so now I should have a PDF book of Pi one to two pages view thumbnails yep one two now there's a little things are a little off here v 11 5800 we run this again and I want the background to be white stroke to be black on this again now if I go here into preview oh great great there we go but I want a little bit more space let's try this okay great yep this is working and I just want to see something I just want to see P font F equals create font courier let me just I just want to use I want to use a I just want to use a fixedwidth font because it'll make all of our lives much easier let me just say text so let me say fill 0 text hello I don't know 400 400 or on this again yep oh it didn't do it oh I have to say text font F I'm just remembering how PDF works in processing there we go and if I were to say now let me just now I'm I'm going crazy here let's string pi if I were to say text PI zero zero with height see what happens here uhoh this is gonna take a little bit longer people oh wait hold on substring let's be more thoughtful about this okay yep M pi equals I kind of just doing this in advance I'm gonna I'm gonna start the Cody I've actually figured I should really stop this is enough okay I got I got it because I had to do this as a coding challenge first I have to really really blow my nose like all these nose blowing moments have been very inadequate so I'm now going to mute myself I'm going to mute the microphone okay I hear that there are okay I hear that maybe there are close to 314 likes on this video which is exciting all right let's get rid of this okay no why just do this now at the beginning of every video welcome to another Pi Day theme Konak challenge this coding challenge I'm going to make the book of Pi so one of my favorite things that I have is a book called a million random digits and it has like it says million random digits it has 100,000 normal deviants and I think I've talked in other videos about the origins of this book super interesting story link to purchase your own copy I guess in this video's description not for me but I will who I would love to have a book just like this that is a million a billion a lot of digits of pi because then I could read it quietly to my children at nighttime when it's bedtime because they're all tired of the random numbers so I would like to make this book and then hopefully I'm gonna make a really poorly design not very thoughtful version of it you're gonna watch this video and you're gonna make your own view more beautiful version of it maybe it will print them well there'll be a limited edition coding training book of Pi I have no idea I don't know what's gonna come of this but I'm gonna do this in processing now processing is a Java based programming environment for it works with graphics as animation to do and it's from the processing foundation link all sorts of links about more of that in this video's description but one of the reasons why I want to use it is it has a wonderful PDF export library so it allows me to draw and arbitrarily draw anything and export it out as a PDF so it can be brought into Adobe Illustrator or it can be I'm so glad that the camera went off right then because I really don't want to buzz market Adobe Illustrator by accident code rate not sponsored by Adobe I mean you vote Adobe I'm right here any time for a sponsor sponsor the coding trade go for it okay a PDF file which is ok I don't know what I'll say I'll just sort me go back to you can export a PDF file which is a vector file that you could you could turn into a and print as a giant poster or make it to a book look enlarge it bring it to another program that accepts SVG's or PDF files and manipulate it so let's get started with this and that's actually what I'm going to do so what I want to do just to start is I want to get this example so there are two ways to render PDFs in processing one is a way where you don't actually see any preview of it just renders the PDF directly and another is a way to see a preview and I kind of want to see the preview so the first thing I'm gonna do is say import processing PDF and by the way this program already has the code to load 1 million digits of pi into a variable excuse me and I will include with this video and this code links to a file that has 10 million digits and a file that has let me just go look this up 1 billion ok and a file that has 1 billion digits so if you want to go even crazier than I'm gonna go in this video you can check out those files as well ok so now I have those just to make sure it's working let me say print line PI dot length length being a function of the string class in Java and I can see there's 1 million digits here and if I go look just look in the data oops we can see I was already testing this we can see there's the 1 million digits okay so it's there okay so let me grow and grep so I imported the PDF library now I want to get begin record I'm just gonna then I'm gonna say background 255 I'm gonna draw a line I'm gonna say stroke actually let's put some text in here because we're gonna need to do text I'm gonna say fill 0 text hello and then I'll put this it's some arbitrary location oh I guess I before 200 200 and then also just so you can see I could say like ellipse you know 40 40 20 30 so let's run this then I'm gonna say end record and there we go so we can see my preview here I've got some text I've got a nice little circle and then if I look in the sketch folder there's a file called filename not PDF I can open that up and you can see here's my PDF and we can be sure that this is not bitmapped pixel images because I can zoom way into it I can blow it up to any size and so this is something that I could now choose to go in print and there this is what I would print so let's make a PDF would it be exciting if I could make one poster that has every digit of pie or my previous visualization example maybe you want to render a poster with some visualization you could also do that in in processing okay so let me try to figure out how can I fit a bunch of digits on to the page so one thing I want to do is let's create let's add a font P font F I know it doesn't actually need to be a global variable because I'm doing everything and setup I'm just say create font I'm gonna use courier which is a fixedwidth font meaning every letter and every digit is the same width it's gonna make my math easier I think as I go let's make it 16 point then I'm gonna say a text font F to set that font and let's say text now let me just do the first ten digits of pi pi and I so the way I can do that is with substring substring 0 comma 10 this is a function that's gonna say hey that string of 1 million digits give me the first 10 and let me render those at pixel location 200 200 okay and by the way what it doesn't this text file doesn't have the three dot in it so let me also add three point because it starts with one four one five nine okay let me get rid of this look ellipse and one thing that I can do just to kind of as I'm working on this and so let's call this also let's call this file book of Pi and let's run this program and now let's open up that file and we can see there it is I have the digits of pi in a PDF oh boy and this is like well it should be selectable text but oh now let's think about this further what do I want to do next let's put it at zero zero and see what happens I should be able to go here and have it update okay whoops isn't it update do I really have to open it again in preview okay I don't see that anymore so one of the reasons why I don't see it anymore is zero zero for text is right off the top there so how big is that courier font maybe the line height is also 16 points so let me say let me put it at zero comma 16 and there we go I got to update and I can see there it is there is the text it's appearing there now let me make this kind of landscape size of an eight and a half by 11 so this would be the equivalent of an eight and a half by 11 piece of paper because it's 1150 pixels wide 850 pixels high this is one way to do it I think and let me run this again come on show it to me there it is view zoom zoom to fit Oh command 9 there we go so there we go there's my book now as a PDF so now let's get some more digits now we should be able to calculate what is the width of each one of these what is the width of each one of these characters so one thing I can actually do for chuckle II for me is I can use a processing as a text width function and I'll just ask for what is the width in pixels of a space and this is why using a fixed width font because everything will be the same so let me look at that so it is exactly nine point six zero one five six two five you know approximately pixels so I should be able to fit on the page so I should be able to calculate this right so the width of each pixal is text with space the height I'm just arbitrarily saying the line height is 16 so the area is width times height so how many of and the area that's and so the area of the area of the area of the of a single character is width times height the area of the entire page is width times height in pixels so I should be able the total number of characters I should be able fight on that page is the area of the entire page divided by the area of each character and I'm gonna convert that to an integer and not worry about rounding issues and then I should be able to say give me all those characters on one page hey it finished and look but here's the thing there are no line breaks right so one of the nice things about processing it will actually fit all the text into a box so what I can add here I want to add is and and the point of this by the way is for me not to have to look at the PDF because I have this preview here so I can actually just add into my text function two more arguments with comma height and let's see what we get okay that's pretty good now why did it looks like it's yay all right why is it it's a little bit down the line height I sort of feel like I kind of want to squeeze stuff in yeah there's a really good question being asked in the chat stn asked I don't really get why using processing for this open the 1 million digits file in a text editor and export to PDF done this is an excellent point the reason why I'm doing this is because my point of this is you could now think of a more creative way what if you wanted to give each one of these characters a different color a different size we wanted to make a spiral pattern you wanted to draw a rectangle based on color think of the visualization stuff that I did so I just want this to be a foundation for building something I also just want to explore PDF rendering and processing to render a book is that even possible I actually never tried to do this before so so I'm gonna try using a line height of 12 let's see how that looks and that's better and I'm down aligned by accident which is probably has to do why did that happen and so Oh 16 let's try this so I wonder if now for whatever reason the way that I'm doing this is I can actually now because I want to fit it in the box aha there we go because I want to fit it in the box now the question is did I actually fit all of those characters into this box perfectly now you can see that there's a little bit of spacing there relative to the spacing there I'm not gonna get too hung up about that probably textaligncenter leftcenter maybe I could if I was doing each character individually there might be a way that I could align the text let's try this work if I just do the I think this is only gonna work if I'm cuz I can do a horizontal and vertical alignment yeah that that fixed this top and bottom spacing but the left and right spacing is a little bit off so anyway I could fledge this a little bit like oh let me just like move it over a couple pixels like six pixels maybe or I could do it relative to the center the that's too many pixels but I'm not gonna get too hung up on that the point of the design aspect of this oh now now actually I'm feeling better about this so the design aspect so here's the question let's look at the PDF there we go did I really get all 1000 all the pixels that sorry is is this really did I get the full substring in on that page so let me say let me let me check some stuff print line total and then print line pie dots up let me look at this substring so if we look in the console at that substring we can sort of this is like the worst way to look at it we can see this is where it ends it ends with nine zero six six one mmm oh boy so something went wrong here let me let me copy paste this into a text file just to be sure so something about my math is off nine eight six six so let's sorry what I'm seeing in the window here let's let's check the PDF to be sure oh look at this the PDF is slightly different five four seven seven nine one five four seven seven nine one who only got about half of it so am i off by a factor of two I assumed the height so where did I get this wrong oh I this is wrong height 12 I forgot that I assumed I need to oh I'm so silly so I assumed the height I calculated the width of the character but I just figured let me make up some height so actually the way to get the height is text ascent which is the highest point of a character there's no text height function text descent I think let me print that out and see what we get of course that's wrong okay let me print that out and I don't want to I don't want to see this anymore 9 oh yeah 9 so now we can see 9 8 6 6 it's the same amount that's on the page so let me print line this I do have to print that out and see where does this end it's many fewer digits ah my math is off wait no no oh boy Center center 301 ah this book I thought that insect was crawling in me 16 pixel plus space isn't there one digit missing the dot doesn't count the dot counts as a digit so hold on let me clear the printing to the console sort off all right let me try this again printing to the console and let me grab this maybe I'm let me look here whoa 6 3 1 2 7 and that doesn't look like what's there could actually fit more it thinks it can fit more stuff not less hold on let me think about this what have I gotten wrong I'm not actually fitting it into the entire the line is line spacing no line spacing I assume okay so I also need the line spacing how can I get that how do I get the line spacing what is the default so what would the default line spacing be I mean I could have just done this now manually like I could do the line spacing manually without using the box the default mean I could just do trial and error here so this doesn't work because this is not the this is actually like the height of the character but there's line spacing in there is there a function in processing on for under text typography but whoops text letting maybe text letting oh it sets it okay text letting 10 that's 10 20 that's 20 ha okay okay we've set for the default if text size 48 is run low okay okay so I wonder if I could get the current text letting letting not letting yeah okay text letting alright okay so that clearly did text ascent text descent doesn't work either because that's just the raw height of the letter itself there's also line spacing in here and another way to refer to the line spacing is letting so I think actually what I might like to do is manually I mean one thing I could do is just manually set all the lines myself but I think I can make this work like for example if I say text letting 10 right before I draw the text if I set the text letting let's actually make it 24 and run this you can see you can see that these are farther apart from each other so if I set it to 12 they're like right on top of each other which is kind of interesting but doesn't really look right so I think probably it probably was like 14 or 16 is what I'm guessing the default was for twelve point fourteen doesn't look exactly right either let's try 16 there's probably a formula for what the default letting is this looks pretty reasonable so let's go with 16 so now I think this is gonna work if I make a very of I say H equals 16 and then I set the text letting to H now what I'm going to do let me run this one more try here okay so it looks like it really really they've squeezed all the way in there to the bottom the last digit is 601 let's look down in the console here let me try to copy/paste what it what it thinks that should fit on that page and let's hope we're right 601 oh there's a lot of six zero ones I'm getting closer I feel like let's see was it at least seven four five one nine six zero one I think I might have to do the lines myself seven four five one nine six zero one so what did I get well I got so much closer what did I get wrong what did I get wrong so the question is alright let's just okay so one thing I want to figure out is look right alright this is turned into a bit more ridiculous than I had thought it was gonna be I probably should have tried this in advance which is maybe a blanket statement for everything I do but let's try to just fit everything in one line and let's see if we can get that let's actually forget about the whole box thing for a second let's just think about one line the text width of a space and so I'm gonna make things simpler here and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say the total is and I guess there's a rounding error here but now that shouldn't matter so much width divided by W so I'm gonna not worry about height and total then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take these out take out the bounding box and I'm gonna forget about letting I'm gonna still I'm gonna put 0 here and I do need I gotta shift it down like 16 points okay total equals why is this unexpected token int I don't see anything wrong with what I've written here o equals I need an equal sign there okay let's try this let's see if we can fit it on one line okay so one line it fit all the way to three zero six and what it should have fit okay so I did that correctly my width calculation is correct so I could just do this in a loop so let's make this happen in a loop so what I'm gonna do and let's get rid of a it's something to be more to do this character by character because then I could do interesting things with colors really what I wanted to do but this video is already taking way too long because we could make a book of just every digit map to a color I think that would be exciting let me get rid of this textalignleft Center thing for a second just to see what's going on okay so that's good it fit perfect so now what I want to do you know what let's just go character by character by golly if we're gonna do it line by line let's go character by character because we want to have that ability to make the sort of magic that we want to make so what I'm going to actually do is I'm going to say I'm gonna start with I'm gonna start with an X I'm gonna start with a why I'm going to say for I'm actually use a while loop while X is less than with X plus equals W if X if X is greater than or equal to with minus W just greater than if it doesn't fit the full letter doesn't fit on let's let's set we're going to go Y plus equal height and X is going to get set back to zero so I'm gonna do this is totally insane what I'm doing now and then I'm gonna say text X comma Y and let me just say H now one thing I'm gonna do to speed things up for a little bit is I'm going to take out the begin record and end record I don't want to deal with the PDF right now I just want to see what this looks like do I not have an H so I need an H which I'm going to make up as 16 oh boy I don't have any oh I don't know if this is never going to stop while X oh and this should be whoa if what if X is then Y goes back to 0 and then I need to break out of this if Y is greater than height minus H break or continue mmm am i stuck in an infinite loop here whoops what happened there we went across this should be X why goes up X goes back to zero just think about this what am I seeing here I'm still seeing oh boy I have all this nonsense oh hi pause for a second the wild condition yep what yeah yeah I've gone totally insane scratch all this Matt yeah rewind rewind why am i doing it this way this is like this is the like I'm at two hours here and I'm like panicking alright I'm actually gonna start with just a loop a nested loop right isn't that insane let's just have let's have Y be the outer loop Y is all closed all the way up to height Y plus equals H so I'm gonna have an H of H of 16 and a width of whatever sort of text width is then I'm gonna have an X X is less than height and X goes up by this then what I'm going to do is just for the sake of argument let me just draw a rectangle and XY with the width and a height so this should wrist represents the box of the letter and I'm gonna say I should start this whole challenge over I really really should I really should just please start this whole challenge over I think I better start it over because I don't even want to like deal with the PDF until I've worked this out it makes so much more sense to not do the PDF thing and to do it this way all right hold on coding training stopping at the station it's going backing up we're gonna take a momentary break here to Center ourselves we're gonna read some digits of pi oh the digits of pi aren't there anymore nine one nine two seven eight one nine one one nine seven nine three nine nine five two zero six one four one etc etc no I'm going to use X in the loop and then keep a separate index for counting through the digits of pi get PI at X Y I thought I would just use a separate index value no I get some interesting discussion between what if I should use an int in the loop but the way I was thinking about is I just want my loop to keep track of the grid and then I'll have a separate index counter that's just walking through and giving me the next digit of pi don't you think that sounds like a perfectly sound idea two mistakes in the code second loop well I'm starting totally over anyway yeah I could do the grid because all right the grid positions could be the reason why their floats is because this text width is not going to actually come out to a an integer but certainly it would make more sense but I'm very I'm very uh okay okay I'm gonna do it my way you are all gonna make a much better version of this just calculate the count for X and the count for y yes yes yes yes yes no I know I could do that but then I have to multiply it out I don't want to do it that way you don't want to do it that way all right we're starting over this is why I make these videos so I can do it in a silly way that you watch and say that's ridiculous I'm gonna learn something I'm gonna I'm gonna do it my own way and you will learn something in that process all right I need a break no I could write it so here's the thing the reason why I want to do them one at a time is I want this to be an example that people could render each character individually with its own fill stroke they could draw you know actually what kayak I want to do is draw a polygon there well I like this idea instead of rendering the numbers I could draw a polygon so if the digit is 0 I draw nothing if it's 1 I draw a line no a point if it's 2 I draw a line 3 I draw a triangle for I draw a square I'm like for a gone what's 4 Greek for for a square 5 a fivesided things 6 a hexagon I need anything I need a break I need to get some water all right please bear with me so also in the chats I was telling me the letting should be a hundred twenty percent of the point size of the font so that makes sense Pentagon right Pentagon Pentagon right this is why I need a short break I'm going to take a pause I'm gonna get some I'm gonna fill this up with some water this is a your waiting music will now be on use my microphone the music is glitchy again you know this happens all right you forget about the whole music I dunno how to fix this it's it's like a it's like a wires crossed thing I figured out it's like interference from some of these different cables I think I fixed it right somebody tell me it's fixed up all right you will have to sit in silence I'm not going to worry about fixing the music right now I will be back I forgot that I muted my microphone actually I think I'm gonna go make myself a coffee I had tea earlier and I think if I'm gonna do this actually you know what I'm gonna do this is gonna be very annoying to all of you I you can hear me now I think what I'm gonna do is 140 I'm gonna take a break for an hour and come back because I would like to do this coding challenge I think it'll be interesting and so then I can grab a quick we may be able to only be a half an hour like I'm gonna go downstairs I'm gonna make a coffee I have a sandwich that I made and actually make it I bought left downstairs for myself so let me go and just take a half an hour break or so and then I will make myself a coffee have a little sandwich my mind will clear so that I remember what a square is and I will come back I'm sorry everybody I know some of you are in but it doesn't you know half an hour doesn't help so and then and I will be back so I will be back in approximately certainly within an hour by 240 but hopefully sooner than that all right okay everybody if you want to I can try to upload the code I made from this morning I'm not going to worry about that I will see you all very soon I will be back thank you for watching
