so in this video I want to summarize some exercise or homework ideas that you can do with this uh topic of word counting and uh text analysis so um number one if you make something please share it with me Twitter at shiffman you can put it in the comments here or if you're part of the uh patreon crowd funding which you can check a link in the description to find out how to do that we've got a slack Channel where you can share and discuss your assignments so mostly the first thing you might try is my example my um if I go back and look at this word counting example example uh it's just literally the word and their count so what might be a creative way that you visualize this and the other thing I I've said this before is think about what happens if you're doing multiple documents how much you compare them and in that sense the tfidf video could unlock some ideas for how you might present that but really I think what you want to think about is why are you doing this what's interesting to you about text what texts are passionate are you passionate about is there meaningful text that you've written that you want to look at in a new way and I would really encourage you to um take a look at pen Baker's research and the secret life of pronouns look at the website which will be linked in this video's description as well to what happens if you're really just counting a small subset of words and these function words these so to speak junk words how can you get how can you um uh could you create a sort of interactive lie detector based on the use of the personal pronoun I me or my based on that research and you'll see on the website there are a bunch of exercises and interactive systems that do this work already maybe you might have a Twist on that or create your own um another thing you might look at are word frequencies as compared you know your emails versus somebody else's emails can you find a match Luke DUIs has a wonderful project called Craigslist MI connections I might be um uh I'll link to that uh reference about that project hopefully in this video's description where what he did was look at Craigslist people will post like oh I saw you on the train and tries to auto match People based on the style of their writing is that something you could sort of think about figuring out how to do um and um that's that's I guess that's my kind of summary so you know you might look at sentiment analysis also if you have a pre uh pre descri pre a premade set of words that are have a positive connotation or a negative connotation what happens if you count how many times those words appear in a certain text what types of analysis and also here's another idea um word counting emphasis on the counting not emphasis on the word what if you count syllables parts of speech sentences words that rhyme with rainbow I have no idea what it might be and is you know thinking back to Twitter Bots what if you do this kind of text analysis analyze stuff on Twitter using the Twitter API post that stuff back as a Twitter bot there's so many possibilities here you will be much more creative and interesting there's an idea in your head I know there is but even if there isn't just start messing around play don't even worry about what you're making you might discover something as you're like playing with the examples so create something share it with me I would love to know more about it and I hope to see you in um next week's session which I already forgot what it's about but oh I think I'm going to start moving on to text generation and maybe looking at Markov chain so that'll happen at some point the videos might already be there by the time you're watching this okay thanks and I'll see you soon
