hello happy Friday it is me dan Shipman the coding train has pulled into the station it had a few delays but it's here right now it's Friday that means is a day for the coding train I know this because it actually says this in my calendar now in fact I don't know if you know this but if you put a allday event in a Google Calendar then ten minutes to midnight the night before it starts like blinking and blaring and alerting you that the coding train is starting when actually I should be sleeping but I'm here and I am super a little bit more excited than usual I'm usually quite excitable but today I'm extra excited I am going to take the day to attempt to accomplish something that I have been attempting that I haven't tempted before for and it didn't go very well and I think I've rethought it we thought about it a little bit so today I'm really going to try to take a lot of the work that I've been doing up until now I'm building a simple neural network in JavaScript and apply it to an actual possibly almost maybe a little bit useful problem so I will get to that in a little bit and I'm going to talk about what it is I'm going to do when I get there this is not a it is a kitty cat okay so but before let me get let me talk about some logistics stuff and by that I don't mean the logistic function anyway so today today it is now about 1040 a.m. I'm actually only gonna be here for an hour or so to start I'm gonna try to do the first piece of this project that I'm going to build today and I'm really just gonna prepare the data set so this morning's going to be about preparing a data set and we'll get to what that is in a moment and then I will be gone for some meetings and some lunch and some other things and then I will be back if I had to guess around 300 p.m. Eastern Time and then I will be livestreaming again for maybe three to five thirty so we'll get maybe an hour an hour and a half in this morning and two to two and a half hours in this afternoon and so the main project just to get to it right now the main project that I'm going to do is I'm going to try I'm going to do a twist on the usual em nest machine learning demonstration and the end this data set is a wellknown handwritten digit data set that is used to test different machine learning algorithms to demonstrate machine learning works it's kind of if you will hello world problem of machine learning and I'm going to attempt to make a similar demonstration but with a creative twist using the Google quickdraw data set and so we will attempt instead of recognizing digits we will attempt to recognize things like hand drawn little kitty cats but let's just see how this is going yeah it's pretty good too this has gone around some improvement oh pretty good three what even knows I'm good for it's like this is predictive machine learning no no we'll get there eventually eight I could do this all day alright so looking at the chat looks like people are watching and not complaining that's always a good sign alright so before I get to any of that let me talk about a few other things Summer of Code this is happening I am NOT an official represent representative of the google Summer of Code I am just telling you about it this is a summer program a funded and managed and by Google where you if you are a student obviously read and check the eligibility or requirements specifically on their website but loosely if you are a college or graduate student and you will still be a student even if you graduate this year you are eligible to apply Google will pay you a stipend if you are accepted to contribute to an opensource project all the guidelines are on the websites one of the reasons why I mention this is if I go under view organizations there are many many many wonderful organizations I encourage you to click through them all and if you're thinking about applying and also by the way if you're not a student you could potentially be a mentor for one of these projects that's a slightly different process but that's something that you could absolutely look into and do and if I scroll all the way down here at some point I will get to the processing foundation so the processing foundation as you might be familiar with if you've watched any of my youtube channel before is a notforprofit organization that I helped to manage and run it is the organization that maintains these software projects processing processing PI Python processing and p5.js the processing foundation also has a lot of community and education initiatives around inclusion and accessibility and so you can read more about the processing foundation on the Prostate foundation website but here if you would we can go here we can do learn more and now if you are interested I proposals don't start being accepted till March 12th if you are interested here you can click through and chat I think will take you to the products on actually a chat will take you to the processing forum you can post your ideas probably the most important thing for you to click on if you're interested in consuming to processing and by the way every open source organization that's participating at Google sort of code will have this kind of ideas list if I click here oh I've got a cable making a black smudge again fascinating that's not just as much oh yeah okay hold on I'll fix that in a second let me go with my I've got momentum here I'm all talking about google Summer of Code so if I click here we get to this project list and you can start to read back let me just tell you about something that I'm oh so one thing improving file i/o methods this is actually something I got to fix that now I now that I've seen it I got to fix that so what that is if you're wondering if I bring my finger all the way up to here see this this is actually a light I could shine it on me and where it's sitting it's kind of the camera is seeing it so I got to move it over yes I am a oneperson show here I think that's better now there's a giant mouse now my shoe is untied it's okay now my shoes untied have to tie my shoe I was saying something important ah one thing I'm gonna do today into this morning in particular is I am going to implement a method to load binary file a binary data file into p5.js that is something that is not currently part of the library so that's one thing but here's my this is my pet project that I'm really actually so I haven't talked about the p5.js web editor on this channel coming soon now look it's all noisy over here I've got to fix that somehow see I think I had the light positioned in a way that the green oak is this there's this pole here maybe we just have to live with this today is that better oh it's a little bit better I mean I've got a little bit more shadow with me but that's fine all right there's a web editor for p5 it's an ongoing project you're welcome to look into it I hope to do help facilitate some videos about all the people who have made this I am not included in that list wonderful people caste ter occasions the lead developer this project but without going too far into this having a a piece that could be a nice google Summer of Code project is making a nicer error console in that web editor itself so if you are a web developer with experience with maybe anyway go look at this stuff lots of other things here all that you can that you could scan over okay so I don't wanna I don't want to go too far so actually let me see does anybody is the sound low and let me know if the sounds low if does anybody have any questions about the google Summer of Code about Google Summer of Code and let me again be clear I am NOT an official representative of Google I am someone who has applied to google Summer of Code as part of the processing organization so I'm just giving you my perspective on the program and how we manage it from the processing side is Summer of Code free Summer of Code is not only free you get paid how you get paid depends I think where you live but it is open to students in a certain number of countries that Google is able to have eligible and all that's on the website all right all right okay so now hmm other thing I want to say okay so I wasn't here last Friday why was I not here well I have to show you my most prized possession in the world it's in my wallet does it have any I don't think it doesn't have any personal information on it really I don't think I'm I don't think you know I'll cover up the barcode so you this is my and you probably can't even see this this is my new most prized possession it's a nice little picture of me I got it on February 23rd 2020 oh no no no that's how it that's what it doe longer will be valid it is a Library of Congress reader card so I had this wonderful chance last week to go and visit the Library of Congress Jer Thorp is doing a residency there if you're not familiar with Jerry's work he does wonderful amazing stuff in the world of data visualization you know that's probably not the best way to describe it but that's a quick way I can describe chairs work I and he is doing a residency at the Library of Congress labs so this is lab Stott Library of Congress and I would encourage you first of all you know I suppose you have to be living here in these United States which comes with its problems trust me I don't know if I would recommend that but Library of Congress is open to the public anybody can go and get that reader card i/o this afternoon I will come and show you I was able to I got a look at the or papers of the mathematician Lorenz of the Lorenz attractor and I have I took photos of his overhead projector slide from his lectures which are really awesome I will show them to you there so much stuff at the Library of Congress and it's not all digitized you have to go there and you can go there and research libraries are like my favorite thing in the world the Library of Congress is probably the biggest library I've ever been to now but I want to mention this I would encourage you to check out the experiments these are projects that people are doing with Library of Congress data here is information about innovator in residency AR Thorpe he is doing a live podcast he has a podcast you should listen to that I've been it's wonderful I've been listening to and he's gonna do a live one you know check his Twitter feed for information about that but in particular I want to go to LC for robots and so this is a place where you can find all sorts of api's and available data so at some point I'm really open to your suggestions and ideas I would love to make some videos and an experiment with some of the content and data that's available from the Library of Congress and then I wanted to find the Congressional data challenge I wanted to mention that let's just go to LC labs on Twitter because maybe it's a look there there's a little tweet here about the Lorenz papers and probably because this has to do with oh yeah this has to do with the thread about jairs project with Lorenz attractor that he's going to demonstrate anyway I got Wayne off topic here I mean I'm not off topic but I wanted to find oh yeah they're retreating me so this is perfect this is what I want to look for so this is the Congressional data challenge I you must you probably need to read through whatever FAQ to find out who's eligible to apply but there is a $5,000 first prize and a $1,000 prize for best high school project enter by April 22nd 2018 especially if you are a high school student I mean I'll help anybody if I can but if you are a high school student and you want to enter this and I can help you somehow I don't know get in touch let me know there's some example projects and you can read all about data visualization data mashup if I had if I if I wasn't on the train that I'm on right now I would love to do if I could sort of figure out a way to do it like a tutorial of this stuff but dayo right no my birthday is not February third you can find my birthday online pretty easily I can't just tell you what it is and it's July 29th dark shader in the chat says I am 14 years old richard barton writes my high school students love coding train I have discovered recently that there's an audience of people most around the age ages between I would say like 13 and 17 who are in high school who do watch my videos which is kind of like I eat Legos which is that really your name I eat Legos and also do you really eat Legos because if they were like chocolate Legos or like a kale like some sort of like healthy you know dried kale with what hemp seeds Legos sustainable eco bio degradable edible Legos this is a project goodbye I'm going to now invent edible Legos I will be back no I won't because I can't do anything for listen involves JavaScript and even that I can't do very well alright let's begin I think this was everything I wanted to say about of a way of introduction to today but I better get started alright so now I'm going to get let's whoops let me turn this camera on ohoh I know there was something else I wanted to do alright so I wanted to do one other thing before I get started with today's project and that is let me go to a website let me go to the coding train comm so if you aren't aware brand new website thank you Neil's web thank you also to austin who's been doing a lot of work that not yet well some work that's now here in designwise and some stuff that's coming this is a I see this as a community project if you're interested in contributing and helping make this website better check out just click over to github and check out the github issues and the there's lots of ways you can contribute even if you don't know how to code just helping write documentation and explanation for how things work or thinking through how the navigation should be to more easily find videos all that sort of stuff so the latest Oh interesting oh yeah I guess who knows how those I ended up releasing this stuff but the latest challenge that I did last week and I just want to mention if you're a kind of live stream only viewer is that a thing I don't I don't know if that's a thing like I just watch the live stream so I don't bother to watch the edited videos this part for was actually not done on a live stream so if you were a live stream only viewer you have not seen this unless you are a patron of the coding train every once in a while pretty rarely if I have like an extra thing that I want to like quickly do and I will do a live stream just with the smaller patreon group and so I just did this part for I'm not hiding any content because it will get released but sometimes it's easier just to do a smaller group live stream to sort something out so that is there for you to watch now what I want to do then is go to coding challenges go to I think so one thing that's a little confusing what I want to do now is show you some community contributions some community variations of 2048 and well it's a little bit tricky because this is one thing I haven't really resolved yet because it's a fourpart coding challenge there's four there's four videos here let me mention something sorry type timeout I know I'm scatterbrained welcome to watching Dakota trait I just saw there was a super chat I don't really I do see the super chats after but I'm not paying super close attention the way that I have my interface is set up maybe I need a better system so I do want to mention that my preferred way for you to support the channel is through the through patreon but of course it's I very much appreciate super chats and I'm going to check this one right now just since I'm talking about it I am currently active duty Air Force and want to get into coding but can't go to a school what is a great starting point I also live in DC awesome wow great to hear from you thank you very much for your kind super chat message this is a great question I mean on the one hand you know I'm hopeful that my my YouTube channel itself can be a place for you to start I would say though probably as much as you know I could I could keep listing like well there's this other YouTube channel there's this wonderful book there's this online tutorial you know code Academy as interactive learn to code tutorials so I could keep going with those recommendations and I'm happy to help collect them or pass them off but I would say probably the most important thing for you is try to find a local community even if it's like a meetup of people trying to learn coding start your own with a few friends I think doing this with other people even if you can soak up a lot of the kind of online resources having a local physical community of people that you can interact with and ask questions to and kind of just sit next to each other while you bang your heads against the wall hopefully not literally but that happens while you're programming I think that's my best advice alright now back to this so with when I have a multipart way when I have a a regular coding challenge that's not multipart and I just go to say Langton Sant and I click on here we can find community contributions on this page and this information for how to submit your up so I'm not on a percent sure what the best thing to do with these four part coding challenges are but right now I think my my I would say neither makes the most sense for everybody to like put their community once in part for our part one let's just go with part one for right now because I think that's what I said and we can see I look at this there are one two three four community contributions let's try to click through these really quickly one two three four and I haven't looked at these I mean I did look at these all so this is a discord 2048 game that's nuts so if you don't if you're not aware of what's actually going on here discord is like some kind of you know I'm like an old person who still if I could just find my parchment I might be able to communicate with people but apparently discord I think is a platform for realtime communication in chat and I I use slack for example as a messaging community for the patrons of the coding train I could use this court I suppose and it looks like there's a way of playing the 2048 game inside discord which is that's pretty wild I'm gonna have to look into that Wow this is a variation it looks like it's very similar to mine but looks much nicer and I'm proud I apologize I'm not crediting the people the first the discord was from Pedro the this one with added colors I believe that's from Isaac and this one here oh look at this I love this this I really want to do I want to get to the point where I have some algorithms for playing the game automatically and I'm just gonna turn this on now and it just played 50 turns can I have it play 50 turns again Oh apparently this 2048 game look just a video of me tiny that okay thank you I'm feeling you know who that was Matthew thank you for that and the last one from Oh L Bach 2048 with variable grid size so this was certainly a fault I know fault is the wrong word but a limitation of the 2048 game that I made were I couldn't do this fight to say ten by ten and now of a sudden I have a ten by ten and I I could also make it so that I win right here you can see the ticket so that I win whenever I get to sixteen let's do that can I possibly get to sixteen yes I made it to I scored 44 points I made it to 16 this is great so you can see the things that we're missing from my tutorial really are a lot of the window dressing so to speak to that that make actually the experience of playing a game enjoyable those are almost you know those are vital to the sort of user experience and the language and design of that okay so I think now that's all of my pre whom I logged in as I'm logged in as the coding train let me see if I can very quickly just tweet here live now the coding train live working with is I think a quick draw data set is from Google creative labs yes made with some friends from Google it's got to be creative labs write creative labs this the Google creative labs what's the chance that's Google creative labs this is what I'm doing by the way I'm trying to like tweet that I've livestreaming while I live streaming creative labs no that's something different alright never mind forget it somebody just tweet that I'm livestreaming I'm gonna do and I'll retweet it from my ad Schiffman just somebody quickly tweet me at Schiffman about how I'm going to do a doodle classification with the quick draw data set today and I'll just I'm looking over here and I will I will wait for that tweet to come in and then I'll be able to retweet it that way I don't I I didn't forget and you keep the link to the coding train slash live in there for people all right let's see how this is doing how we doing here eat very nice okay let's make ourselves a nice little cat that really doesn't look like a cat does it does that look like a cat welcome to the Internet were you a person sitting somewhere is watching somebody attempt to draw in an html5 canvas a cat but the perset person is just really incapable of drawing has no talent whatsoever and made a sad cat all right all right what oh did we break Twitter did we break Twitter just for my like asking people to tweet at me cuz it's just something that's wrong it came back okay good fiery feather thank you fiery feather here we go live now okay thank you fiery feather all right so now is this on yes so this is old from I can erase erase this all right so just to give you a quick summary of what I'm going to do I am going to build a simple EM nest classifier but I'm not going to use em mist I'm going to use Google quick draw drawings I'm gonna use my toy neural network library that I built and some things that I want to make sure that I cover during this so I want to make sure I talk about softmax and crossentropy so this is probably not something I'm gonna tackle today but as after I get through this using the toy neural network as is I probably want to add this and no idea what this is yeah I mean at least neither did I like two days ago I mean I sort of did but I've been trying to read and understand it better so I will get to that I don't know why I put a one there these I don't really have I don't I'm not sort of doing these in numeric order I think an important thing to make sure I talk about is overfitting and then of course under fitting I want to talk about training versus testing and that really also falls under supervised learning what are some other important concepts if your if you're watching this and I know I just wrote off the top but that's fine if you're watching this and you watched my neural net build a neural network playlist all the way from beginning to end what I'm looking here is to create a scenario that uses all of that and then sort of a it's maybe something that somebody could do something creative and fun with after but also kind of touches on important themes and pieces of machine learning that I didn't get to and I just got a notification B where the upper limit of the screen yes Sasa max okay hold on wait I'm looking at these yep yeah this is totally off topic but Meriden in the chat youtube used to be incredibly strict about the channel names but you can you can actually I mean maybe I've reached some threshold where they let me do it but I'm able to I could change my channel name now pretty easily check your Twitter feed I sent a small p5 firework program okay I will look at that all right okay I'm sorry Ellen that you have to go as well all right all right I'm not seeing anything that I'm horrific ly missing from this list or that I'm just not like slightly missing from the list I mean there was something else I wanted to just say you're before I get started oh yes so Google YouTube it's all this that everything is Google I mean hi YouTube hat released a whole bunch of new livestreaming features and I kind of like glanced at them and it seems like okay I think thumbs up but one much which I definitely felt excited about is apparently this live chat that is going on right now will be preserved so previously up until today every single live stream that I've ever done I have never be able to go back and read the chat afterwards so I'm actually planning to do that that's the kind of I it's the kind of thing that I definitely would do and maybe after I do it I will decide but again because it'll just make me feel sad but hopefully it'll be nice so I just want to mention that that's a new feature they also the other thing that I understand is they have added they've created their own IFTTT if this then that and otherwise maybe perhaps I don't know I might try this other thing that's that I think that's what it stands for so I think I can do like weird stuff that if someone does a super chat you know I then my Philip's branded lightbulb oops not a sponsor I buzz market something by some sort of like light bulb go off or like a little confetti cannon would burst or something so I'm I would love to figure out ways to make this experience more interactive and fun one thing that I have going right now is if anybody in the patron group is in slack that's me on in the live channel and the slack group I will get my watchful buzz so that usually is useful for my mic cuts out or something but anyway but I don't love the idea of like oh you have to pay this money to make the thing happen so anyway I will explore and look into all that but let's see what's with the cat that's what's gonna have its what I'm going to explain next all right so we're getting there let me prepare some URLs so I need this one oops oh thank you for asking Solan rights so here's the thing thank you for asking about this Solon asks any news on my pull requests for visualizing the neural network so I have to apologize I have not there's a couple reasons I have not gone through and merged any of the pull requests and I'm kind of amazing overwhelmed by them there's a couple of reasons for that number one is I it's honestly just heavily like I haven't been able to make the time to do it thoughtfully and I don't want to just like do it willynilly but but it's gonna be I mean I was trying to say this in a way it's not like oh look at it but it just it hasn't been I haven't been able to get to it that's reasonable on the other reason is I'm I'm not sure I kind of I want I haven't figured out the right balance between having the project progress with community contributions but still having to be something that if someone's watching the video tutorials they can look at and follow so some of the pull requests are so unone derful but they've really re engineered in a significant way and if I haven't covered that aspect of it in a video tutorial I'm not sure that I I'm ready to merge it into the library and there might be some way that I could be more clever about different branches or that sort of thing but the other thing is I'm not sure couple of pull requests which are amazing are about adding multiple hidden layers and one of the things that I'm really doing this for us cuz I really want to get to involving a neural network with a genetic algorithm so that I can do some stuff with like agent modeling and training agents to do certain things and so I feel like the one hidden layer is gonna make that much simpler but maybe I just really haven't figured this all out yet and I'm hoping to continue to figure it out so I apologize my apologies to those of you who submitted pull requests I really appreciate them I have looked at all of them I just haven't figured out about merging them all right Philip asked how long until he actually starts with the main content when he is not in a hurry yesterday see I feel like I'm not in a hurry today because I know I'm gonna come back later but yeah I'm bad don't don't watch my channel yeah I I don't get to stuff quickly that's for sure alright but I'm gonna get started now I've got to get started now all right so I've got quickdraw I've got my little silly mmiss thing I have God quickdraw data set I'm gonna open up process if you believe this I'm gonna use processing not for the ultimate example but at the beginning do this okay quickdraw quickdraw data set my mmiss thing and here and then toy neural network think these are all the URLs I need look at this 23 pull requests amazing okay this is the me this is the mate how do you know when it's the main content except for the fact that this is really bad yeah it's a little bit better all aboard it's time for the coding train is really loud and it's kind of like a piercing sound I need a different life friendly or like the train is pulling into the station sound its plug into the station we are going to begin and we will start here hello oh wait let me take care so this is gonna be all I'm sorry I don't yeah you've really thought I was about to get started didn't you that was nice of you to think that wouldn't that be nice so where is this gonna go that's what I have to say so I don't think I this is not a coding challenge because I realized I try to do it in a code it's gonna need to be like six seven parts it's more like a series I think that this series is already ridiculously long it's 18 videos plus this just fine so this either needs to be 11 like nature of code 11 or I do have that I'm not logged in as myself I do have I do have the intelligence and learning thing if I go to playlists let's see what that is session 4 is neural networks is there a session 5 how do I find like all the intelligence and playlists session 3 let's look for session session 5 session 5 war but that's from the A to Z class so I think this is session for that was the end of when I started and that's all the neural network stuff so maybe maybe this is like session 5 of intelligence and learning session 11 and nature code I don't know matsu I will and I will take your advice but this is I think this is the start this is our this is its own playlist okay I'm really starting now it's where no I feel like I have to leave hello welcome to a new series of videos and over the course of drill or in the blank number of parts I don't know probably it's I would guess maybe gonna be 71 hours and 632 parts there's my one Mulligan for the day I promise I'll do this once at the beginning hello welcome to a new video series in this video series I'm going to build something that thing is going to be a doodle classifier in other words you might be familiar with something called M nest you might have heard of M nest it's the mmiss database of handwritten digits this is a very famous classic hello world if you will a data set for machine learning to test an algorithm to see how it works even to teach about machine learning it is it is divided into training and test data I will talk about that during the course of these videos but it is a database of handwritten digits here is a and you can see it if I if I say no loop here in the console really quickly you can see there is a zero it is labeled in the database as a zero now what I have over here is my beautiful drawing of a wonderful kitty cat which by the way my example of trying to guess what digit that kitty cat is it guessed it as a two so what I want to do in this series you could find my m'not example it's not in a video series but it's there in the github repository is I want to build from the very beginning a n mist style classifier but instead of classifying digits I want to classify doodles so I want to know is that a cat you drew or a puppy or a rainbow or something else and how am I going to do this I am going to do this with the Google quickdraw data set up so quick draw is a project I believe from Google creative labs and let's just play it for a second let's draw draw an octagon in under 20 seconds oh my god 1 2 3 4 5 ok and this is way too stressful for me and it started talking to me I know if you could hear that I know I don't got it I don't got it so this is a game that you can play and as you play it a machine learning system tries to guess what you're drawing and it just so happens that let me find quick draw data set I don't know what I'm looking for here well that I already have that sorry ah quick draw did it just so happens that people playing this game Google collected 50 million drawings across 345 different categories and all of that data is available to you and in fact this is what I'm looking for I could go to you could and I could browse the drawings here so I could say like let me look at all of the cellos and you can see these are millions and millions of different cellos that people have drawn and I have access to all this data now what's really interesting is that in addition to just having the image itself you're like oh look I can see it on my screen the system saved the vector path of the drawing itself so there's a lot that you could do with it in thinking about this sequence of how it's drawn and that's something I hope to get to at some point in a future video but in this example I am going to treat these as little bit mapped images I'm just gonna use a little snapshot of each drawing that's going to be the data associated with a given classification also known as label or class this is a 28 by 28 pixel cello now this is not my own genius idea because I don't have any of those definitely not M NIST Google quickdraw this idea came from this blog post by Rajiv Shah using Google's quickdraw to create an amnesty dataset you can follow along and there's information about how to do this all of this is looking at how to do this in Python I leave I don't know if it then goes on to use tensorflow or what or if it's just actually showing you how to get the data but I'm going to sort of do this on my own and I'm gonna use processing and to to parse and work with the data and p5.js to then do the neural network magic stuff okay are you with me are you gonna watch this so the first video this is like my introduction to the idea and in the next video I'm gonna start working with the data but let's do let's ghost go a little further by way of introduction so how is this going to work and so one thing I want to mention is that I already have the I'm going to be able to do this because I have built something and there's a whole video series that you can watch where I build it's about 10 or psych 18 videos long toy neural network this is a JavaScript implementation of a simple neural network now eventually if in the great future beyond when you're watching this in the year 7,500 from your gelatinous tube I will hopefully have also completed this same demonstration or similar demonstrations using something called ml 5 which is built on top of something called deep learned Jas so deep learning is is a project also from a Google research group which is an implementation of deep learning in the browser hardware accelerated with the GPU doesn't that sound fancy so basically it's a highly optimized way of doing a lot of stuff where we have really big data sets and you need to do stuff faster in a more robust fashion for me right now I want to demonstrate the core concepts and using this sort of like simple toy library is is not gonna produce them quoteunquote best results but I'm hoping it reduces the best results for learning at this point and we can I'm gonna get to this stuff after that okay that's number one so assuming I have that that means I don't have to in the course of these videos write the code for the socalled neural network the neural network is going to be the thing that sits in the middle something has to go into it some set of input something has to come out of it some set of output now I should mention that to do machine learning to say like oh here's some data I'm going to give it to you please give me mmm I should say that to do machine learning in the sense of like here's some data please do something with this analyze this data for me do some math with it and then give me some information about it back a neural network is not the only thing that can sit in between input and output and you might have seen other videos that I've done about you know K nearest neighbor there's things like support vector machines decision trees there are lots of other machine learning algorithms through this for this case for this learning process and for some of the other examples where neural networks perform really well that I hope to get to that's what's sitting in here so what I need if I have that already from my library what I need is to figure out what are my inputs and what are my outputs in this case my input is going to be did I right off the top of the board oh it's not so bad it's not so bad okay slightly too high on the wall okay did I have any like horrible I'm seeing that well hold on we could I think it's fine there wasn't anything in those drawings that was really awful was there I shouldn't pick jello I guess anyway um coming back to this sorry I am going to use a 28 by 28 pixel image maybe it is said doodle of a cat right and that is going to be my input into the system now if you've watched my previous videos what you'll typically see and this will change as we get to more sophisticated machine learning architectures in particular I just wanted like foreshadow this something called a convolutional Network which is really designed to work with images I'm not doing that yet this needs to be flattened and it needs to be flattened into what's often referred to as a vector or a one column matrix so I need to take this data it's an image and convert it to a list of numbers this is this is the what this is probably in many ways the most important thing that you need to do when you're working with machine learning is like what is my data how do I format it and and there's lots of other questions about it as well so well I'm gonna come to that but let's just think about this this is a pretty this there's a way that I can do this I'm not saying it's the quote/unquote best way but there's it's certainly a simple way each one of these pixels has a brightness value that brightness value is somewhere between 0 and 255 I can normalize it because it helps to have your inputs have kind of a smaller range of lobe numbers I could normalize that by dividing by 255 to range from 0 to 1 and then now 28 by 28 is 786 a 784 pixels I now have you know one you know point seven point six so this will become my inputs I need to look at the images I need to convert it into an array of floatingpoint numbers and normalize between 0 and 1 and that becomes the input to the neural network system and if you look at the neural network library it's actually that's what it's asking you to pass in to a train function or a predict function give me an array of numbers ok let's let's pause here for a second because I want to go to the outputs but I really have to say something something that I think is super important and timeout for a second I want to point to somebody's research that I Mimi Onew Onew Oh ha I wish I knew how to pronounce her name correctly a miss I want to go to here two missing data sets okay so alright sorry I'm looking okay so I just I think this is important to say I want to take a moment here just to say that this video series what I'm doing I'm really trying to focus on the sort of obviously the learning process but what I mean that's like your learning process learning about how this stuff works how to build software that uses it okay these suggestions I only want you to notify me if it's an emergency okay okay uh let me start over again I'm just I'm joking around with you guys it's it's it's totally fine I'm really trying to figure out how to fit this little piece I don't want to talk about into this video and I'm gonna attempt again all right so why don't just take a pause here for a second and I want to get to the outputs but before I do that something really there something really important here so while the purpose of these video tutorials that you're watching that I'm making is probably primarily the learning process what I mean is your learning process and I'm just creating a kind of arbitrary scenario that's somewhat interesting to see if how this stuff works you really if you really if you're working with machine learning these systems it's really important for you to ask yourself should I be doing what I'm doing is what I'm doing ethical am i hurting someone I did I what is this data set that I'm using what's missing in the data set so we think about it this we could say okay well I'm just building a doodle classifier you know what's the worst thing that's gonna happen but I think as a useful exercise to yourself you might think about who is not rep what is not represented in that do dataset so I would love to come back to this as a topic about how to collect data and think about data and bias and algorithms in a more substantive way I will just take a moment to point you to the research of Mimi on ooh oh oh ha ha who runs a project called missing datasets and I encourage you to check out her website and a lot of her work around missing data and ways and people are abstracted represented and classified so that said let me come back now to the next piece output so if our input is pixels and we've taken all of those brightness values and normalize them to zero through one we now need an output now here's the thing what am I trying to do in the case of the handwritten digits I'm trying to say is it a zero is it a one is it a is it a three bla bla bla bla bla in this case I'm trying to say is it a kitty cat this is a rainbow is it unicorn is it a cupcake all these wonderful things is it a heart baby there'll be some hearts so let's just say I'm going we have to make a decision here let's just say I'm only going to use three kinds of doodles in that case my outputs what I want is also a vector a 1 column matrix a list of numbers and I want those numbers to represent the probability that this particular image is any one of those given categories for example if it's if it's a kitty cat instead of a rainbow or a cupcake maybe I want it to give me that output if it is a rainbow maybe I want it to give me this output if it is a cupcake maybe I want it to give me that output in reality we're probably going to see something that looks when when the neural network itself is guessing we're gonna see something that looks more like you know a point eight point one point one and in theory we want all of these to add up to 100% now the first time I do this as I begin it's probably not gonna do that but at some point towards the very end of this playlist I'm gonna get to something called softmax which is an algorithm for guaranteeing that the output of a neural network everything adds up to 100% probability so we'll come back to that at some point okay this is the main idea and so what we have going on here is a supervised learning process and by that I mean we have this data set it is labeled I have the data from Google I have all those drawings so I'm going to give the neural network I'm gonna say here's a drawing of a kitty cat I expect you to say to me 1 0 0 if you give me an incorrect answer I am going to ask you to adjust all your little parameters inside of you weights and things inside of your neural network and try again we're gonna do this over and over and over again that's supervised learning here's known data here's known data here's known data we've got to do that for quite a while before we are ready to then say now I'm gonna draw my own kitty cat for you what do you think neural network do you like it so that's the idea but there's an important piece of this when I go to get the data one thing that I want to do is that I want to make sure that in addition to training data let's say I take 1000 kitty cat drawings I want to save some amount of it you know maybe a typical amount it might save is 20 percent so I might save 200 of those drawings and only use 800 in the training process and save 200 of them for testing meaning how can I know whether my machine learning algorithm is working well well if I just test it to see if it's getting the right answers for the drawings I've trained it with I might be stuck with something called overfitting overfitting refers to when almost like the neural networks doing such a good job it's trained itself so well that it's so highly optimized in tune to the stuff that you trained it with that it can't really deal with stuff that it's not trained with and that's thing we have to watch out for now there are techniques to fight against that I'm something I'm going to come back to in another video it's like something called drop out and there's more and more things but one way we can at least sort of test ourselves that we're hopefully not overfitting is by running data that it wasn't trained on and seeing how will it perform how many do I get correct out of those 200 after I've trained it so this is what why I need to do so that's by way of introduction then the next video what I'm gonna do is download a bunch of drawings prepare them and get them ready because it's work by the way preparing cleaning normalizing thinking about your data is just as a big is a project unto itself right machine learning isn't just some magic that you do and you just say sprinkle the data on it and now I'm done you've really got to be thoughtful about that data and so let's I'm gonna hopefully hopefully I will be somewhat thoughtful about the data in the next video okay see you soon all right the lowest vector is partially out of the whiteboard Oh poopy pants I think it's high was that at that you know you people got the idea right zero zero one you can imagine there's a one down here right right I mean mature you can do some if you want you could do some postproduction magic but I think it's okay wait plus 1 for K week men to be YouTube modded fYI while you're looking yes I do I have to do that nobody else can do that let me find a message what is love ad moderator caching ching ching that is correct Mohammed I am a teacher how long I will continue to have a job as a teacher remains to be seen but for right now I'm hoping all this YouTube stuff will eventually get me fired I should be so lucky okay wrong screen at the moment thank you alright I think this was good it is now 1134 I think I can go forth to the next piece of this oh I am excited I feel so much better about this already because certain topics really require just like some take your time go through them think about them and when I'm like I'm gonna kind of challenge do a classification it's just like I don't allow myself if I know it's gonna be multiple parts yeah alright apologies to me me oh well I'm sure I mispronounced her name her work is amazing okay this I don't need anymore this I will keep this keep okay alright we're gonna we're in this is gonna go away now this is gonna go away now and this is gonna stay here okay okay yeah these are fine I didn't show anything that's like somebody got their obnoxious troll is cello drawing in here right you're gonna pick cello let's go so first of all let me think about this what do I want there's so much Oh bird definitely like the bird is there a rainbow let me just go to the opensourcing of them the raw moderated dataset preprocessdataset I think I want the preprocess okay yeah I want the preprocessed so where is I just want to have these links ready so I'm not like looking for them where's the Google Cloud link see if this takes me there no that's just the documentation that's not what I want get the data get me the data Oh where's that Google Cloud Cloud console there we go this what I'm looking for now let's see please email me no I agree that my use of any services in it relate api's is subject to my compliance with you pickup ball alright everybody now as you know I always read the Terms of Service so before I click yes you'll just gonna have to bear with me oh my god which one do I read wait hold on servicer is with the applicable Terms of Service oh wait maybe it's this one my joke how long can I keep this joke up because I you know I'm just gonna click yes but I wanted to services and related api's services and oh no this is all ok wait quickdraw which I don't know which to ID what do I have to read all these don't I because I just don't know which one it is glue google cloud big data big tip blogger Helena cloud API is cloud datastore API oh wait oh no these are all oh no this is which one oh good Google Cloud maybe I need a machine learning algorithm to tell me which one of these terms of services okay let's let's read the cloud platform and let's let I think it's more appropriate if we sing it Google cloud platform

is just singing Terms of Service somebody ping Sam Levine I think this could be good for for for stuff that he's working on okay so let me close all these and I'm here okay so I have I told I have no idea what's going on anymore we love what tree thought okay so and I have to go soon so I better get moving on this all right I would open up processing which I did already and I am going to talk about the data okay cat there we go look at this even it says where it was drawn interesting okay alright here we go rainbows and there's rainbows and trains okay well hello so let's just do cat because that's kind of ubiquitous a rainbow and a train I think that'll probably be good right when we'll do three categories it's important to do more than two but I don't want to do too many okay where are the trains where are the trains somebody tell me where the trains are see ambulance oh just go with the cat alright I'm back and in this video I am now going to look at how to actually make use of this data set just as a reminder this is the quickdraw data set by the way there is so a much goofy fun creative interesting things you could do with this data set that have nothing to do with this whole machine learning neural network and nonsense stuff so hopefully this video will be useful for you anyway and encourage you to make creative projects with the data set and I will try to link in the video's description to some projects that other people have made but let's talk about how I'm gonna get access to this data and use it so one thing we know it here's all the kitty cats and we can say look who I really like this one so I'm gonna look at this one click on it so one thing you'll notice it's got a number it actually is it's got a its it has a date when it was drawn and what country it was drawn from which is interesting by the way in light of my discussion of missing data sets and the work of Mimi oh that I talked about a little bit in the previous video thinking about when you're working with a data set where does it come from who collected it what's missing from that data set why are you using it is what you're using it with going to hurt somebody think about these questions now fortunately for us I think we're just gonna make a fun goofy drawing thing and I think we're going to be okay but those are really key and Fortin questions now this is a nice little interface to look at the data on github however I can go to github quick draw dataset and here is the documentation for what kind of formats the data is actually in so if I scroll down here for a little bit we can see the data is actually available in these nd JSON files now what's interesting about this is you can see like oh look there's an ID every single drawing as a unique identifier and I know I'm standing in front of some of this so let me move this over it has a word which I would assume is the category yes what the what the player of the game said will you please draw this and when it was created what country and then the drawing itself and look at this look at all these numbers what are those numbers so if you remember from my previous video what I'm trying to do is do image classification with a simple 28 by 28 pixel image but the data itself is actually all of the vector points the path of the drawing and that's why when I'm on this page as I hover over it you can actually see a replay of how the thing was drawn itself so that's something I would hope to come back and make a future video about using that data but what I actually want to use and we go back to here is a different way that the data is formatted so there you can go in here there's binary files but this is what I want numpy bitmaps so a number is a special data format that stores all the pixels of a bitmap version of the drawing in a format that the Python library numpy can read very easily with n P load now if I were a person who lived in the regular world I would see this a go Oh perfect I'm just going to go and do my project with numpy because that's what people do but I am a person who lives in this weird world of wanting to do things in JavaScript and in the browser and sometimes in processing so what I want to do in this video is look at how I can get access to the numpy bitmap data format in an environment that's not numpy and then kind of clean or normalize or organize the data in such a way that I can use it for my machine learning doodle classification project all right so let's get the data if you click through and read this documentation you'll find that it is here the data is available on the Google cloud platform if you want to listen to me nevermind I was thinking as longer layer that I think I shall not speak about and so these are all the different formats I'm gonna go here under numpy bitmap and I'm gonna see okay look at this now I think we have to start with rainbow I probably should start with train but let's this is not a very effective way to get to it let's just make a little edit point here Oh guess what all right so I'm gonna get the rainbow dot n py file and it's downloading it's a very large file it is about 100 megabytes so I don't know how many drawings are in that exactly we're gonna figure that out when I open up the file but what I want to do is make for myself I want to make a little simple training and testing set with just a thousand drawings in it again to do this kind of work effectively the more data I have probably the better but to demonstrate it in a quick and friendly way in a YouTube video using a small data set it's probably gonna be best and then you the viewer could take my code do something with it kind of expand the data set alright so it should have downloaded by now I'm gonna work with preprocessing this data in the processing programming environment which is a Java based platform I could do this in Python I could actually go directly to JavaScript now but I'm just doing this to demonstrate it and it's kind of what I would do because I know processing the best probably so I'm gonna just make a little sketch called quickdraw data let me put it on the desktop I'm gonna open up the sketch folder and I'm gonna grab this file and put it in there in theory what I should do is probably make a folder called data and put it in put it in there and then I'm just going to rename it it has a long name I'm gonna rename it to rainbow dot and py okay so now processing one of the reasons why I picked processing is it has a function called load bytes oh you cannot see that at all look at that you cannot see that at all unless I do this hold on a sec pause how's that too big just right I think I can make it smaller right is that okay okay great okay so I'm gonna use the load bytes function and I'm gonna say I was about to say let but I'm gonna say byte I'm gonna say byte but I've forgotten to how to program in Java byte a data equals load bytes rainbow npy so this is a nice little function let me bring the console up here cuz I'm on a console print stuff to the console let's just say print line data dot length so I'm gonna run this and we can see look at that that data that array I now have 99 million bytes so interesting let's try to figure out how many images that is well I know that each image is 28 by 28 and so that's 784 total so total equals data length divided by 784 and let's see what we get now I really should do this as a floating point just whoa and let's let's print line total so that's about a hundred twentysix thousand images now the thing is this isn't actually correct and if I wanted to do some research most data files will actually have bytes at the beginning that aren't the data you want but are something called header bytes and those header bytes describe the data like this is what's in here this is what format it is this is how much of it there is and what I probably should do is look at the numpy binary file data format if I google that I'm gonna get somewhere and I'm gonna get some page that explains the npy I should just scratch that it should just look for npy file format and I'm going to find some information about how its formatted here's the thing I looked at this yesterday and I happen to know that there's about 80 extra bytes on the beginning not about exactly 80 extra bytes so what I'm actually going to say is data dot length minus 80 because that's how many bytes that are actually in that array that have to do with the pixels and we're gonna see that's exactly how many 126,000 images so let's just see if everything's going correctly we could at least look at the first one so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable called start I'm gonna say start at 80 and then I'm going to look at 784 bytes and the index is I plus 80 and what I want to do is also create let me make an image that is 28 by 28 let me load the pixels of that image because I'm gonna write the bytes into an image so I can look at it and then I'm gonna say int Val equals now we're gonna run into an issue but I'll fix it anticipating things oh and I need to say RGB so when I say create image I've got to say RGB so value equals what did I call it just data data oh and this should be plus start data index data index that's the value and then I want to say image dot pixels I equals that value then I want to say image dot update pixels and then I want to just draw that image image zero zero look at that oh is that really a rainbow maybe I should have picked something else because I kind of wanted to see like is this really right so that is the first rainbow now these a little bit like why is there some yellow and some blue so I haven't been for I haven't been very thoughtful about this one thing that's happening is the byte values that are actually coming in there are signed bytes so they're going to have be between like negative 127 and positive 127 or something approximately like that so I can actually apply a bitwise operation and I just sort of like and it with some hexadecimal numbers I could kind of go through that in a different video but this is going to I believe if I'm doing this correctly change it from an unsigned byte to a sign byte to give me a range between 0 255 so I I should try to link to a resource about bitwise operations or make one myself at some point so now you can say ok well that's weird now it's blue well the reason why it's blue is I'm actually this is a number between 0 and 255 val is and i'm setting that number to be the pixel color but a color is an RGB color so in processing if i just wrap this in the color function it'll take that number and make it into an RGB color with that value as the red green and blue value okay so now we should see there it is there's somebody's rainbow alright so let's get a little further with this now let's make a window that's 280 by 280 let's do this let's have let's forget about this was just for my own curiosity let's say we're going to look at 200 100 images right 10 let's say 10 at 10 by 10 so I'm gonna say for int N equals 0 n is less than total + + + we're gonna do this we're gonna do this 100 times and so the start is 80 plus n times 784 alright because each image is gonna start by the eighty header bytes and then how what image were on times 784 pixels so even if I just did this right now we should see there's the last rainbow I just drew them all on top of each other but now I need to get an X value which is n modulus 10 right because I want the sort of column to be modulus 10 being the remainder of dividing by 10 so the column goes 0 into the new frozen i901 and the y value to be n divided by 10 so the for the first 10 I'm in row 0 for the next 10 I'm in row 1 and so now I should get ooh what did I do wrong there did something wrong if I run it again will it fix it what did I do wrong here and modulus 10 and divided by 10 oh wait a sec I'm drawing the stuff in the correct location I know what the problem is weird though index is I plus start index image pixels I hold on a sec next times with oh yeah no oh yeah yeah yeah yeah whoops so I forgot this should be well okay this should be 28 and these should all be in variables right because they're each 28 by 28 pixels wide so I guess I was drawing the last one 10 pixels over that was the problem format won't do it for me okay there we go all right so there are all my rainbows I don't like how there are white on black so I'm just going to say 255 minus and come on there we go rainbows okay all right so we've done it we've accessed the data I kind of understand how it works now what I want to do is save it out into a format that I can easily use in p5 I'm thinking about this so on the one hand I could save this to like I could rewrite the data to like a JSON format that I'm happy with I'm gonna weirdly I think what I want to do is load the data in as binary into JavaScript because I think it's probably worth doing that as an exercise yourself you might think about rewrite it's it's also processing it's a bit convoluted to write out a JSON file from processing although quite possible so I think for simplicity what I want to do now is just save bytes so let's say what what I want to do whoops what I want to do is just save a file with only 1000 images in it right it's because I don't want to have to carry with me this 100 megabyte file while I'm just trying to learn and figure this stuff out so I make a much smaller file with just a thousand in it and so let's look at how I would do that so I'm going to create a variable I'm going to call it out data and it's a new byte array with total times 784 and again your the thing is these numbers are never gonna change so I'm kind of happy with just hard coding them in there but obviously I should refactor and make all 28 and the 784 I mean all I need is that 28 and the 80 should be a variable but we're gonna be fine so I want to save I'm gonna say about 200 287 or 100 of these images and so while I'm going through here I'm just gonna do out index is 0 so every time I get a new value I'm just going to say out data out index equals that value and then I'm just gonna say out index plus plus so as I'm going through I'm just going to write in this mmm so this is actually I made this into an integer so I could use it in processing I think if I do this it will be happy with me I might have this same anyway so I think that that I think is going to be fine and then what I'm going to do is at the very end I'm gonna say save bytes what where does this Rainbows 100 I'll call it dot bin for binary Rainbows 100 dot bin and out data so this is a function in processing that will save that array of bytes to a binary file I'm calling it rainbows 100 I'm gonna run this we can see now I should be able to go to the directory we could see there it is and how big is this file it's just 78 kilobytes so I have a hundred of them you know just a binary file but that's not let's let's let's save a thousand of them and now that I'm saving it I think probably there's no reason for me to have the image anymore so let's because I the image is just to like sort of see that it works so let me comment that stuff out and now I want to save Rainbows 1000 and I'm gonna run it and there we are rainbows 1000 bin and this is this file is just 784 kilobytes so this is really nice because now when I move over to JavaScript I could kind of use this very like lightweight data file that I can play around with and later I could go get the full numpy file or and I have this processing sketch which just allows me to quickly work with the data and resize it reformat it that sort of thing okay so this is now the end of this particular video in the next video what I'm gonna do is look at loading these data files into JavaScript and dividing them into training and testing training and testing datasets to use them ultimately with the neural network and in between you watching or me recording this particular video in the next one I will go ahead and make a bunch more of these so I will make one for trains and one for cats I think I'll just do three I don't know maybe when I come back I'll have picked some different ones but if you know pause if you're watching this as a playlist maybe go and play around with this data yourself think about how you might draw it in a different way and processing or an mp5 and have some fun and I'll see you in the next video ok alright so what are we have we on time noon mmm so I think let me do let me let me get some more so let's let's go here what did we say I want to try train and actually even if I'm doing a thousand I like to to see them as it's going and I wonder if I should rewrite the data as white pixels I'm a black on white rather than white on black but this is like even though it made yeah so actually I actually just leave the image stuff in there so one things that's nice about doing this is if I scroll over here there's this public link and I can do copy link address and I can actually just put that in here so I can just access it from the URL directly and now I can say what was this trains 1,000 so it's gonna take a while because it's kind of a bit like why is it taking so long so it's got to download the file great so these are all the trains oh these are awesome wow these are really this is probably a poor choice because this is so insane they're so insanely different but it'll be interesting so people are asking is the stream done sorry I'm doing this in two parts today so I've got to leave and do a bunch of other stuff for a few hours and then I'm gonna come back and and finish that III definitely finish this project

doing this in like three parts today if that happens I believe YouTube so how do you know when I'm livestreaming next here's a little lesson in YouTube go to youtube.com the coding train I'm not actually signed in as myself I'm signed in as some other Google account and now I need to go and hit subscribe I am subscribed already and then I actually don't do this I'm gonna do this click the alarm bell if you click the alarm bell YouTube should send you a notification the moment I go live and at some point I will schedule it but it will be on exactly this page youtube.com slash the coding trained slash live and I'm seeing K week Mon is typing I will choose not to read you have to join the patreon the patron group to read K walk weak bonds message I will take a few questions before I go oh wait Simon did notify me with something that is worth mentioning I just that Simon maybe had made something relevant to what I was showing ah so Simon Tiger github.com slash Simon Tiger / decision

it's a thing that I I mean I do stuff in Python when I have when I do stuff in PHP sometimes so we're working on WordPress you know I tend to limit myself to processing and JavaScript for my video tutorials but if there's something I'm working on where a different programming language environments really gonna make sense than I will use it whoa three blue one Brown just came out with a new video I just got a notification what languages do you teach on school dan I so I teach the same stuff that's in my YouTube channel that's exactly what I teach all my classes at NYU how do I get the ideas for the coding challenges people suggest them I do have a github repository where you can file an issue to suggest one really though as I'm trying to teach stuff and do stuff along with the courses that I'm doing it anyway have you ever thought about using Python every day will you teach us binary code I need to know it I don't know I don't know what that means exactly but at one point I did find that song it was I think I got it off Free Music Archive I have to find it again okay that's the end so thank you everybody this is not the end I mean it's never the end but this is not even
