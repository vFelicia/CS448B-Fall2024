I'm sure I'm already live but I'm waiting till it actually tells me that I'm lying just as my adventure starting looks like it started okay hello surprised are not so surprised or happy Kotick train Wednesday after an evening by the way for like 15 minutes outside it was a complete whiteout blizzard and then it went away to all of you anywhere in the world right now where it's freezing cold please stay warm stay safe so if you are if you are watching this right now what I'm about to do is a continuation of my livestream this morning my livestream this morning was 3 hours and 14 minutes long I'm hoping that this will be we've done within a half an hour there was a major bug that I hit at the end of a livestream thank you so much to Alka Alka design Alka magic Alka all kinds of Alka who gay who submitted some code to fix this bug and so I'm gonna use that code and finish off this tutorial that I did this morning so I if you didn't watch this morning you're gonna kind of may perhaps be a little bit lost but all of this will get edited by together and put into a playlist the beginner's guide to machine learning at some point alright so before I do any of that though let me just go to github.com slash because I believe there was a yes here it is so here is the so I'm just gonna write thanks for posting the canine classification save function could only get it to work with fewer than 40 example images alq design Alka magic I can't alka what are you on github Alka design let's guess that yes there's Alka Alco design scent has volunteered to submit a pull request with the following i'll just document it here for the i don't know what that for the following file saving code and then let me go to my code here which has alkis code in it that i tested which is here i will paste it in this looks good okay let me comment there alright Oh Michael Peters is in Chicago London it is below zero hey that's below zero Celsius nope that counts Oh Michael Peters this negative 20 Celsius yeah below zero counts it's cold but I heard it was below zero at least the windchill like was way below zero alright well hello I'm glad that Archer cut my Chicago viewers have something to do sitting inside in the warmth but somebody are already like thank you out okay so I'm not gonna worry about this but what I'm going to do now I'm sorry to be rushing I mean I'm okay I have 35 I you know I I have like a real time that I have to leave as opposed to my like fake time that I give you so hopefully this will work out but what I'm gonna do is and not you hopefully this can work editing it together but if it can't it can't what I'm going to do is I just want to get this code into the way that I want it I'm going to take out the XY thing I'm going to I think I had this already I'm gonna take out XY I am going to in draw I am NOT going to draw I'm not gonna do this and I'm gonna do this and I'm also going to take out shoot where I need to go look at my livestream shoot I mean if someone might be all do help me this I need to figure out where I'm picking up from I don't have this in my head hopefully this isn't gonna take me forever oh my god I'm a ridiculous person where did I start training it like I was just testing let me put the speed on 2x had I already gone through a full round of training and loading and explaining I think I had we get the Select channel up here so I did this this is all legitimate content that I think I did like 15 times where it worked one of those cases where actually just this is one of those cases were actually just like redoing the whole video it would be easier but I just want to say I want to find out where I first had that bug because that's basically we're gonna pick up from here that's me trying to explain again what the models a JSON file is deleting it multiple times I like the Dane writes I love this raw behindthescenes with Dan ship okay almost got it this is good this is good news because this is what I wanted it I wanted to be already it was just the moment where I was gonna train a better model the saving has done and I hadn't done the loading yet okay that's my explanation all right all right so this is the moment I'm picking up from okay great for when you do editing you can note that basically picking up from 2 hours and 42 minutes and 32 seconds all right so I'm gonna close that then I need to put the code back tonight I hit save what I want to do is I need to get rid of the loading also so I do not have load and this was just in here insufficient permissions oh are you kidding me it copied this from my other user account oh my god oh my god why why why are you serious okay don't worry I'm gonna ignore you I'm just gonna don't don't even bother me I'm I'm done with you K&N I'm going back to kN I'm deleting model dot JSON I am opening this in Visual Studio code you cannot defeat me KNN I am pasting all this code in here I'm hitting save I am going here I am going to kN I am hitting HTTP server I am now I'm going back here and I'm hitting refresh and there we go and then I am adding back in video hide so this is where I was before just to be sure to wear some foot did I already have need training data I'm pretty sure I have had that pseudo yes I know so just to be sure about this briefly let me make sure this is actually working I'm gonna do like a hundred of these let's just get up I mean we it broke down easily at like 75 so now I'm gonna hit save and I've got a nice big 2 megabyte model Dutch JSON file perfect okay so that's working now with the fixed code and then I just want to be short just to really be sure I shouldn't close this okay great it says new training in okay cycle the cameras finish this tutorial and here we go let's finish this you might not realize this but it's about four or five hours in real time that has passed since the moment ago when I was about to do the next thing in this tutorial I ran into a pretty significant bug which ml5 didn't allow for saving a JSON file of a certain size with a certain amount of training images and you can see right now I just tested it with 76 training images it just worked so I'm going to continue this tutorial as if I'm picking up right where I left off but you should be aware that you're actually going to need a newer version of ml5 the version number will appear right here and be in the video's description in order to get the example to work with more than maybe 40 training images so just be aware of that particular bug now where was I what I was about to do was try to train a better model we've left right up and down and I am going to do that now okay here we go I'm gonna move but now the thing is I just have to actual has to realize this even though this is my left that's to the right on the screen so I need to call this to the right wait oh it's so confusing no oh oh no no I'll figure this out later I'm gonna actually go to my left which is to the right in them it's fine it's gonna be okay here we go oh no let's speed this part up because I'm gonna train it for a while you don't need to watch all of it this is to the left 40 images now I'm gonna go to the right and I'm gonna go and out like that and I'm gonna come over here and go down a lot of images and I'm going to go up let's do some more down ones okay so I trained it for a little while let's see how well it performs and if it's not performing so well I could add some more images so this is to the right pretty good this is to the left pretty good weird if I if I move off like I probably should give it just like I should probably like let's tell it this is left also even with just a sliver of me there and then if I move down down down down so even with just a sliver of me let's tell it it's down okay now up up up down left that's left and right okay this is a good model let's now save the model so I'm going to press s and the model is saving I am going to go to the Downloads folder I'm going to take a look at it now look at this this is actually a five point five megabytes and by the way using the word model is perhaps a little bit misleading a project is called a K&N JSON because a can and model is just the raw is just the raw all the data it's all of the it logits with their label there's no neural network involved here at all there was a neural network involved in generating the features of the image but now we're just storing a lot of them so that we can do a nearest neighbor calculation alright so this needs to go into the KNN directory and hopefully we can see that it is here time out oh yeah it is there sorry there it is it's a really big file I could click on it it kind of loads in visual studio code but I don't really need to look at it okay so now the next thing that I need to do right if i refresh this page it's it wants me to train again the next thing that I need to do is load the model so I'm actually going to move this I want to make sure before I load my can and model Cana on database database data set what I want to do is make sure mobile net has finished loading so I'm just going to take this out and put this in the model ready function and then I am going to say K&N load model dot JSON and I don't need to ever I don't need to train it again I mean I can train I don't need to I don't need to oh I don't need to call go classify and draw the way I did before that's no longer relevant I can just call oh this is this this needs a callback that's so confusing when the model is loaded then I could say go classify so I'm just putting an anonymous function callback in here so when low global net oh I should put in um let's see I'm going to say console dot log I'm gonna say mobile net let's clean this up load it then I'm gonna say K&N data loaded and so now I'm gonna refresh model load Canaan load it and then if I go right left down up we've done it we now have four classes being triggered by where I put my head and let's move on to the next part the exciting part the sort of the part where you should really stop watching this video and come up with your own creative idea but just for simplicity I am going to put an x and a y just to give you a demo I'm gonna make an x and a y I'm gonna start those x and y's at width equals to height width divided by 2 and height divided by 2 I am going to then in draw I'm gonna get rid of this oh and by the way ignore this down here I put in some extra code here to get this to work right now if it's not working in the ML five library but don't worry it's by the time you watch this hopefully there'll be a version of the ml 5 library and the example that I publish will be the version that doesn't that extra code in there but I added the corrected bug fix from Alki put it directly in my code oh boy this is gonna live on forever in this tutorial but whatever it's good good to see how the process works and that's that's this here your code is gonna look like this not like this but this is my little hack extra save function just to get it to work okay moving on in draw I'm gonna say background 0 and I want to draw an ellipse at width / hi no I want to draw an ellipse at the X&Y X&Y with a you know a size of 36 I'm making that up I'm gonna make it white it always comes up here I've tried to like shove it down there but my auto floor mat brings it up okay and then I don't need to draw the video anymore however I would like to see the video so I'm gonna get rid of video hide and let's just see what happens here all right so we've got the ellipse and now I want to be able to move it to the left now left is really to the right in terms of it following me but I want it to move the opposite way of how I want it to mirror myself I got it up and down it's gonna be easy let's do up and down first let's do up and down first so I need to make a variable I'm gonna call oh I already have the moon this was in there from so I need to add a variable all right up and down is easy so I need to add a variable let label equals and we'll say we'll just make it blank to start with and label and then whenever it gets a classification in addition to putting it oh shoot I have all this already in here so sad I forgot that I did some extra code all right on let's go back here let's start with upanddown that's easy okay so the thing that I need to do is I need a global variable Y is this yelling at me no no don't save I need a global variable to keep track of what the label is and I'll start that as just an empty string when I classify when I get a classification I want to set that variable I I do want to display it in the window so I can see it but then in draw whatever that label is oh I wonder if I should move it mmm let's just do it and draw there's a variety different ways I could do this but I could just say if the label equals up then Y otherwise if the label is down then Y plus plus so I'm gonna move x + y up and down here we go up down up down I think I would probably want to do like more of a physics simulation or something where I'm pushing it but you get the idea now let's add left and right this is a confusing quote oh yeah if label equals left remember left is my left meaning I'm moving this way but it's actually moving I'm moving this way it's actually going to the right but I want it to go to the left I'm gonna see myself going the wrong way oh this is very confusing no but I interaction why I want it to go this way so I'm gonna say X minus I should mirror the image it's probably easy way for me to do that right X plus plus okay I almost want to hide the video now cuz the video is gonna go the wrong way whoops here we go I need another parenthesis here comes I can give myself a little more space all right yeah I wanted to follow me come over here come over here hey come back so I almost don't want to see the video now because the video makes it confusing be interesting for me to like alright so and then maybe what I'll do just for the timing is x equals constrain between X like just don't let it go off the screen the y equals constrain just to like leave this in the example and then how do I mirror the orange I know how to draw it we're in Reverse can I just do it in the Dom element like CSS magic there must be some CSS magic timeout for a second somebody is still avoiding switch statements I know there must be some right left also that I should also change the text right this way that's it so I'm just making me crazy can someone please help me with some CSS to reverse that video right CSS flip video element transform scale negative 1 1 okay so if I do a video style transform scale negative 1 1 let's see if this works oh thank you oh my god thank you thank you right it's doing the right thing now right okay thank you once again to Al codesign who reminded me that there's a CSS property transform which I can give it basically what looks like the P 5 scale function I want to reverse the xaxis keep the yaxis flip it negative one this is some P 5 code to apply some CSS but certainly I could just put it in HTML etc but now when I go back and refresh as I move to the right and now of course it's opposite now down what you're seeing like I could go in like highfive myself but what I'm seeing is exactly right like if I take myself off oops now I'm not in the picture okay so watch this I'm gonna move to the right come on I'm gonna try to keep it in the center that's gonna be my game here up a little bit okay down a little bit I need to do a classification another label for like don't move right so I could add one more label like I'm not gonna save and train but let's just see if this works I really should go oh wait you can't see me anymore Here I am I should add where is my key pressed let's add else/if key equals space KN add example logits i'll call it stay so stay I don't actually even have to do another if thing because it has to the stay is like not doing anything so I can run this and I'm gonna give it some training data stay say say say say so I'm giving a training in ax so now it knows to stay so I should move to the right and I'm going to turn myself up right to the left and by the way it's getting it wrong so I can like just give it some more data like it should that should be left right stay can't stay open stay oh I hit save by accident stay up up down I could do this all day alright this is my result so now what we have done just to review we have looked at loading the mobile net model I guess I should bring myself back here as well we have looked at loading the mobile net model which is an image classification model trained off them on the image net database we are not using the classifications from that model rather we are taking the logits that layer before the last layer before the softmax before the probability is assigned we are taking that we are paying we are saving a lot of those logics each paired with a label and building up a big database and then when we get new images we think those all of those images with their labels are in 1,000 ameno space we get a new image it's somewhere in 1,000 dimensional space what collection of neighbors is it closest to and which label is that that's its label we get that result and we do something with it in with p5 so thank you for watching this tutorial sequence about ml 5 tension flow Jess and K&N classification please if you make some kind of interesting thing with this please share it with me look in this video's description for a way to do that but certainly at Schiffman on twitter is a quick way to do that also share it with @ml 5jf also so that ml5 can see him ok good bye thanks for watching okay great I still like I still can't get my left am i right like it's like it's like crazy to me how I can't figure it out but I think it's right now but I'm not flipped here that's the issue oh my god okay thank you everyone it is 520 look at this I'm gonna do some thank yous I don't answer any super chat questions which I'm now trying to do thank you Gemma gasps eh for your comment segmentation fault core dumped and thank you why bass to another for another new member of the coding train wonderful just as a reminder if you join via YouTube if you hit that joint membership I have to manually add you to our slack discussion group scroll back through the community tab and look for a post there that has a Google Form that you can add your email address and then you'll get a slack invite I'm pretty slow at checking it I need a better system for this so but ping me on Twitter at Schiffman or send me an email Daniel at the coding train I checked every once in a while and I will make sure to get you added if you are pinging me if you're sending me an email to be added make sure you include your YouTube username so I can cross check and make sure it's legitimate okay hey that circle tries to escape with machine learning you still oh yes alright so David Schneider a new member David Schneider who made like this cool polar roses thing this is the same David Schneider I assume that I saw on Twitter recently how long are you going to stay on the stream unfortunately this is the end right now I have to leave I have to get home to have dinner with my family and get ready for tomorrow we another big day at work I will be back I am doing I missed last week I've missed quite a bit actually in the last month you may have noticed I will be back this Friday team what it was it again let me look at my Twitter team turbulent flow this Friday is team turbulent flow all right turbulent flow not laminar flow boring flow Alliance going parallel turbulent flow team turbulent flow that will be the coding challenge for this Friday I really III boy I only have like two days now to figure this out if you are so inclined and would like to help me with this I really like I'm gonna print out for to read on the subway ride home I recently updated I am going to be printing out these this PDF and this PDF so I can read them hopefully they will make sense to me I will be able to understand them to be able to implement something not nearly as sophisticated but something that does something like this yes I don't know what's that laminar turbulent I don't know I I like it all turbulent whoo team turbulent flow that's right okay see you soon good bye sorry awesome on I'm so glad we're here for the first time watching online I really I know I say this all the time and I never make it happen but I'm really going to try to have two weekly times that are fairly consistent and most likely Wednesdays and Fridays or Wednesdays and Thursdays Mondays and Tuesdays are out for me but Wednesday Thursdays and Fridays are all possible I see a message from Simon I better check the prize yes assignments are gonna mention apparently there's a 1 million dollar prize navier's stokes 3d so i don't know the 3d navier's stokes problem apparently there is is not known whether any of your stokes which are equations for youit's elimination whether they'll work in 3d apparently there's a 1 million dollar prize somewhere if you can find it share it with me and I'll see you all on Friday Friday morning team turbulent flow okay stop screaming no I have to click over here one of these days I'll have a way of doing this
