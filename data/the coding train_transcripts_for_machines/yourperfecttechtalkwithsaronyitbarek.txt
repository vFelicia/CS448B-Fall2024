hello welcome to a special guest presentation episode thing of the coding train so this is special episode uh it actually is an archive of a live stream I'm recording this introduction after that happened because I had a bit of some sound problems during the actual live introduction you didn't miss anything trust me um but I'm really excited I'm always um happy when I have a guest uh to with a diff different voice different point of view to uh talk to you about something interesting and meaningful um and so today I'm very pleased to introduce to you San yarak um siron uh I met first when I think I was a guest on her amazing uh podcast called code newbies is it code newbies or Cod newbie code newbie sorry code newbie um so code newbie is um I I really recommend the podcast there's you know it's been how many years now uh over two over two years there's tons of episodes to go back listen them all the thing that I like the most about it is there are so many different stories of people's Journeys through learning to code discovering to code and I think if you picture in your head what you think a programmer is and then you listen to the code newbie podcast you're going to have a different picture after you listen to a lot of episodes so I I really would recommend that podcast um Saran is also uh organizing a conference uh April 20th 21 and22 um in New York City it's called codeland oh it's right behind me oh my God it's right behind me April 21 and 22 um this is the URL and so there's still tickets available and so what I asked her to present about or the idea that she had was was you know what is it what how do you put together a tech talk you're presenting at a conference you're presenting at uh a lunch at work or whatever it might be what are some ways to think about putting together a tech talk and I know that I struggle with this all the time and I want pasting slides together so anyway I'm I'm talking too much um enjoy this uh presentation there is a small sound glitch during the presentation it's just about 4 seconds long but hopefully it won't affect your enjoyment of it at the end I answer some questions from the audience and then if you also have questions you can ask on Twitter uh you can ask San or me on Twitter check this video's description and of course you can ask in the comments below okay thanks and now I'm going to travel backwards in time for San's presentation hi everybody my name is San I'm super excited to be here uh this is my first live stream YouTube thingy uh so let's both cross our fingers and hope this works out so as Dan mentioned today we're going to talk about your perfect Tech talk and just to give you a little bit of context about me I'm siron I'm the founder of code newbie we are the most supportive community of programmers and people learning to code we do a Twitter chat every Wednesday we have a weekly podcast every Monday uh we have a a slack group I think we've reached 9,000 members so far uh we're all over the world we're really excited to code and one of the things that I'm super super pumped about is a conference that we're doing it's our first conference and I talk a lot as the screen says I do a lot of speaking um I've done Keynotes I've spoken all over the world and my favorite part about putting this cand conference together is getting to work with other speakers a lot of firsttime speakers and helping them put their talk together and really craft it so as I've worked with I think we have about 30 speakers uh I've come up with some really good patterns some ideas that I think will help you so that's what we're going to dig into today so if we think about the different stages of putting a talk together there are four parts there's the ideas and the brainstorming there's the content the structure and the delivery we're not going to talk about delivery because that gets before we dig into these individual Parts it's super important that we Define what a tech talk is now you're thinking s obviously this is a talk about tech things sort of right I think the more helpful way to define a tech talk is to talk about what it is not so what isn't a tech talk it is not a lecture can you remember being in college or being in school and actually enjoying your professor's lecture of course you don't it was boring you probably skipped a lot of them it is not a lecture do not bore your audience number two it is not a soap box I see this all the time where speakers use the opportunity to have a mic in a stage to rant and vent about the latest JavaScript framework that's pissing them off let's not do this and it is not a blog post if you think about a blog post it's a lot of content it's very maybe there's some pictures maybe there's some videos but you don't really get to emotionally interact with the blog post it's a lot of content that is usually very useful uh but there's no human element to it if I watch your talk and I think to myself I could have just gotten this from reading a post it's probably not a great Tech talk so what is a tech talk a tech talk is a performance you have a stage you literally have a stage you have a mic you have an audience this is more theater than it is anything else it should also be informative that's the the tech part of the talk right sharing people your technical knowledge your maybe some opinions uh maybe some expertise if you feel like you have some and a tech talk is emotional and this is one of the things that I really learned from watching a lot of other talks and thinking about the ones that stuck with me that I I literally play back over and over again in my head to this day they're the ones that didn't just tell me information or give me a timeline or throw some tech terms at me these are the ones that said wow I felt this way I really struggled through this I was really excited about this and that emotional connection optimizing for the fact that you were a real person physically there with your audience is huge so now that we've gotten all of that out of the way let's talk about phase one the idea ideas are super super hard and they're even harder if you're a beginner because you generally think well I don't have an original idea I don't have anything that I feel like I need to share with anyone and they're hard if you're a firsttime speaker because even if you've been coding for a million years and you're the CTO of this and that you may feel like well I still don't have an original idea because it's already been written about it's already been talked about and the other thing that makes speaking and idea generation really hard is that a lot of times we assume speakers are experts and I think that's kind of a problem we don't want to view speakers as experts we want to view them as storytellers and we'll get into stories a little bit later so when I try to think about the ideas that I want to share and put into a talk I ask myself a couple questions that really help out one is what is something that I'm proud of what's something that I've done no matter how small it is or how big it is that I can look back on and go yeah I did that next I think about what have I learned every time I learned something I usually call my mom and tell her this new tech thing that I solved she has no idea what I'm saying but that's okay she pretends that's why she's awesome but what is something that you've learned and you were excited about it enough to share it with a friend a significant other a coworker and the third thing is what's a project that you've struggled with the thing that I find so interesting about tech talks is we view it as a platform for expertise but some of the most popular talks are really about failure one of my favorite Talks by uh oh I name I think it's Jacob Kaplan Moss I hope that's correct uh who helped open source Jango is he did a talk I think it was something like I am not a good developer that was the whole thing it got thousands of views on YouTube because he spent 20 minutes talking about how much he sucked so talking about your struggles and your failures can actually be very very powerful and if you're a beginner if you don't feel like you have a lot of expertise that can be a really great idea source for you so you may notice that these three things what you're proud of what you learned what you struggled with have one thing in common it's about you which gets to the real source of this what is something that only you can tell me about I want you to keep that in the back of your mind so everything we've talked about so far is super theoretical it's all very high level and everything is wonderful and easy when it seems you know theoretical we don't have a real example so we're going to dig into an example um and I I really just want to warn you for this part this is uh this is really exciting so if you're not sitting down you may want to take a seat for what I'm about to show you this is the cookie dough ice cream cone no it is not cookie dough ice cream it is just cookie dough there is a store I believe it's in New York City that sells different flavors of cookie dough it's like it's safe to eat and all that stuff and you just scoop a whole thing of cookie dough and you put it in a cone and you eat it that's amazing this is also known as happiness that that was me I I I decided to just call it happiness and if we look at this awesome video can I play this video I can't play it it's okay it's just someone scooping uh cookie dough thing it's fine uh and if we look here we can see that it comes in different flavors there's even a Nutella flavored cookie dough ice cream cone it's magical so you as a very amazing developer you know real problem solver you hear about this cookie dough ice cream cone and you think yourself the world really needs a map they need a map to find out where are all the places where they can find this cookie dough ice cream cone so you decide to do a little data visualization project you decide that you're going to make a really cool map and you're going to use something called leaflet which is a JavaScript library to make interactive maps and you realize that it's a very simple map because there's only one store and only one data point but you've never used Lea flip before you're super excited about your first interactive map and you want to talk about it so the idea that we're working with is how to map cookie dough ice cream cones that's the idea so now let's look into the content the problem with that idea is it's really boring if you think about the technical aspects of it a map with just one data point is not the most lifechanging exciting technical feed in the world it's actually very boring so you might be tempted to look at a couple different angles a couple different ways that you want to talk about it because you're still really excited the first way you might present this topic is you might want to do a collage you might want to do three cool map projects using leaflet that's helpful that's informative but do you need to give that talk can anybody give that talk can that be in a blog post if so why are you the right person to tell me that story the next idea you might have is how to use leaflet to map cookie dough cones this one's a little bit better because the cookie dough cones part makes it a little more exciting makes it a little more personal but at the end of the day this is really just a tutorial now now would you rather have a tutorial in a talk format where you're sitting in an audience you're sitting in a row you don't have your laptop out you can't follow along you can't pause it you can't ask questions is that really the best way to show how to technically accomplish something probably not that's a great candidate for a YouTube video or a tutorial on a blog post so let's think about a third angle for this how I made a map of cookie dough cones ooh that's more interesting because the part about that that is interesting is not the map it's not even really the cookie dough Coles although if you're me that is really the only thing that matters it is the how I made that's the part that makes it about you that's the part that makes it about your journey and that's a story that only you can tell right okay so we are going to focus on that idea and we're going to talk about the way we might structure that angle so let's talk about structure now there are three parts to a talk one is the technical junk all the the tools and the Technologies and the buzzwords there's the story there's also the Lessons Learned now one thing I've seen especially when working with a lot of speakers and going to a ton of tech talks myself is people really like focusing on the Lessons Learned that's a thing that people get really excited about and the thing is nobody cares nobody cares about your Lessons Learned the only person who cares about your Lessons Learned are you that's it because the Lessons Learned are the things that you walked away with they're the results they're the solutions those are the wins but all of those lessons learn without any context doesn't mean anything and the interesting thing about lessons learn is they end up sounding super generic the lessons are things like communication is very important y right it might be things like uh debugging is a skill that takes patience I think we all know that it might be uh read the errors these are all great lessons but when you present that as the Forefront you're going to get a lot of yawns in your audience and we don't want that so the second thing as a developer you might be tempted to focus on is the technical part all of the buzzwords and the jargon and all that now the thing with that is that can be great depending on your audience if you have a super technical audience that might be what they're really into but more than likely you'll have an audience who isn't quite familiar familiar with your exact set of tools so you're going to end up either boring them or they'll get really intimidated and just kind of check out of your talk we don't really want that but really the thing about technical stuff is nobody cares again nobody cares about leaflet until they know why they're using it what problem they're trying to solve the technical stuff only matters in the context of your story so if we go through these three points we end up with the story Lessons Learned and technical stuff only matter in the context of the story which brings us to the question what is a story now this seems like a very obvious question but uh based on on a lot of answers I've gotten I'm going to go ahead and say that we need to review this together stories are about conflict I think the easy way to think about stories is oh there's a beginning middle end no no no screw that that's not what matters what matters is there's a problem I come to you I say hi I'm San I'm doing this thing I ran into this problem here's how I fixed it the moment you can get to I ran into this problem your audience will sit up they'll think oh crap how did you do that oh my goodness I've had that problem myself how would I solve that it immediately becomes interesting as soon as you roduce that tension so if we think about these three components this is kind of the order that we want to structure our talk in we want to start with that story we want to present that tension that conflict right off the bat as soon as we can and then we want to get into the technical part because it is a tech talk we want to introduce those tools the the terminology the framework that kind of thing and then we want to end with the lesson because the lesson is the resolution that's how we solve the problem and that's how we make sure to never have that problem again crossing our fingers so this means that you are going to be tempted to have a story section then a technical section then a Lessons Learned section now let's think about that if you structure a 40minute talk in these sections you will have spent the first was it 12 and a half I wish I had done 40 I'll do 45 45 minute talk that means you'll have structured the first 15 minutes telling awesome stories in which case I'm I'm excited I go oh goodie this is great and then you'll spend the next 15 minutes talking about all the tech things and throwing a lot of words at me that hopefully I understand and then you spend the last 15 talking about a list of Lessons Learned and if you remember the tech talks you've seen a lot of the technical section stuff and lessons stuff ends up just in bullet points and bullet points aren't the most exciting thing to look at for 15 minutes instead what you want to do is you want to take that story and you want to divide it up generally stories work well in groups of three I think most things work well in groups of three so we're going to divide our story up into three parts part one will have its own story its own conflict we'll introduce the technical components and then we'll share the Lessons Learned part two same structure story technical stuff Lessons Learned and then part three story technical Lessons Learned and if you think about the structure in this way the original the the more common definition of a story having a beginning middle end end up falling right in line part one is your beginning part two is your middle part three is your end now if you do it this way you'll have a couple benefits number one is you have one cohesive story those three parts even though they have their own conflict their own tension really they're three parts of the same Journey the same narrative and that makes me feel like I'm not being interrupted it gives me an incentive to keep going that cohesion is really really important the third thing that really works out when you have that three story structure is you're introducing a new adventure every I should have said like 33% right 33 darn it 33% of the talk so you present a problem and maybe as an audience member I go oh I can't really relate to that I'm not really that interested that's okay 33% of the way in I get a new problem I get a new tension I get a new conflict that we're going to talk through so it gives me an entry point a ramp an onramp for your talk at three specific points which is very nice and the third thing is that all of these lessons instead of stacking them at the end when you interview them throughout your whole talk you have context for that so this goes back to one of the things that we talked about at the very beginning of this video which is that your talk is a performance when you position things as a story you're optimizing for that performance feel you can in use inflections you can use gestures you can bring people up you can bring people down you can really be a little more theatrical when you have that content structured as a story it is still informative by making sure we have a technical component in each part of our talk we're able to make sure we're giving people real information and ideally some next steps and some tools to look up afterwards and when you structure your talk in this way you are optimizing for emotion you're optimizing for the fact that I'm not reading a blog post I'm not watching a video I am physically here in front of you and I'm sharing this story with you the more I can make it about me and my journey the more able I am to connect with you and that can be really powerful and all of this is really just a bunch of building blocks and a bunch of tools to to optimize for how people will remember you because no one will ever remember what you said I'm sure a month from now you won't remember most of these points but hopefully I will have excited you and made you feel like you can do a technical talk and that's the thing that I want you to remember people don't remember what you say they only remember how you made them feel so the more you can excite them the more you can bring them on this journey the more you can make them feel resolved at the end the more likely they are to remember your talk and hopefully remember you you so these are all the lessons that I wanted to share with you uh and and my own takeaways from putting on Tech talk if you are interested in coming to cold L would love to have you it's specifically for people who have less than two years of professional coding experience but hopefully you'll hear some really great stories and talks uh because we'll be using a lot of these tools to work with our speakers uh you can get tickets and learn more at www.and.com awesome that's what I got okay I don't know people can hear me now I'm going awkwardly come back into the frame should I go over you can Shuffle I'll wait I'm going to unmute my microphone okay first of all thank you so much what you guys don't realize is zon is really being great here there's like a classroom next door there was like music coming in I don't think you could hear any of that there a lot of distractions so that was really wonderful thank um and uh you know for me I'm I'm this is great is particular I was actually just working on some slides for a very short presentation at codeland and to be honest I wasn't really thinking about the story of it that much it just kind of like well this will be interesting to the show and this will be interesting the show this is really just all for you so this is very helpful good for me personally which is what it's about no um so I have a bunch of great uh people are saying the weird guy is back yes that's I usually don't uh uh I have some some great questions from the chat first of all uh there was a really nice comment since this was a tech talk in a way um I just want to say there was a nice comment that said I like how San's presentation use short informal sentences and bold sentences and it makes it sort of feel powerful so that something you sort of thought about when you're yeah putting together yeah that's that's the thing you know I um the very first talk that I did I actually did a full I did all these original cartoons and I drew them and I Inked them and I put them up and it took a ridiculous amount of time so the next time I did a talk I did nothing I put as few slides up with very very simple colors and I realized that people actually liked it better when it was simple and Punchy and short so that's definitely something I think a lot about because it's interesting because I I do see a lot of talk sometimes there's no text and it's all just image image image and talking over it versus you know it didn't really occur to me now it was all text which I think you know was very simple and Powerful in that way um so one question from exjon D cool asks how often do you get nervous before talk and does it get easier now that you've done maybe more than one talk that's a great question um I get nervous all the time I was nervous on my way here like oh my God it's my first live something something holy crap I get super nervous I think the interesting thing is when I'm a little bit nervous I actually do better because it's my way of of caring and putting a little a little more thought and love into what I'm doing so I think being nervous is totally not a bad thing um some more like practical tips on on nerves try not to eat a lot before um I usually have like dry toast and maybe some tea and ginger ale but my stomach and my bowels get a little kind of fun but yes I get nervous all the time i' I've talked all over the world and I'm still getting nervous so yeah it's not just you it's all of us I'm just nervous whether I'm giving a talk or not just as in existence although I'm more nervous when giving before giving a talk actually during a talk I don't feel nervous anymore it's all the sort of anxiety building up to it once kind of there and if you can remember that it maybe it'll help a little bit yes and and one one quick story that I'll share just to to really make you feel better um the first talk that I did I realized that I was so nervous that I was clenching my butt cheeks to the point where my left one started vibrating so yes I get nervous that's how you it's amazing yeah okay uh I will go on to another question um these are these two of these questions are kind of similar but let me let me start with this one which is so this is really since you know Cod land is a conference for people without a lot of experience in code code newbies is a podcast that's really accessible and friendly to beginners what if you are a beginner with little experience um what's it how can you give a tech talk how can you present yourself with you know just with with being a beginner yes yeah I love that question um one of the the things that I've learned is again we we think of speakers as experts but if we think about them as storytellers I think that makes things a lot easier one of the most famous famous one of the most popular talks that I've given a ton I think I've given that talk 15 times uh was about reading code and it was the story of me graduating from a boot camp just getting my first job and feeling like I didn't really know what I was doing and so as a tool to help me learn I got a bunch of friends together for one hour every Sunday and I would read about a 100 lines of code and we'd read it together and we'd go through it and we'd have a discussion and my 20 minute talk was just about that it was about the process of reading code as a tool for being a better developer I thought the talk was super boring um to this day I hate the talk I think it's like the worst talk ever but people really liked it and they liked it not because reading code is a new idea or because you know I have years of of experience but because I positioned it as you know I started in this place I was a beginner like a lot of you I really wanted to become better and become an expert here are the steps that I took uh here are the things that kind of went wrong along the way and people really enjoyed the journey so I think if you focus on what is a journey that I've had right and Journeys about stories are about conflict so what's a problem what's something you solve with something you're excited about I think you'll realize that you have a lot more to say than maybe you think you do now great people are telling me that my mic is rustling a little bit this is by the way this is like a very new day here I have two microphones and somebody wrote in the chat like Dan is pretty good at coding tutorials but not so good at sound management and I apologize for that so I'm doing my best here but now I'm sort of muting my microphone when I'm not talking we'll see if that helps um okay so I have two more questions um one I think is a really interesting question from um oh and I forgot to say who asked that previous question which was Tomas bik Nas which I'm sure I'm apologize for mispronouncing the name but Ben J habt asked and I think this is you know you talk so much about um framing the talk as a story and in a way like a personal story but what U how do you approach um giving a talk if maybe the work that you're presenting is from a company or is anything something that's like sort of comes from yourself that's maybe directed by others oh that's a good one so I love hearing uh the the company side of things because I'm always wondering if you work for a really Tech a really big tech company how did you do it you know who did you have to work with how many people were involved so even in that context I think there's still a story you know the story might be as simple as why did you decide to implement that feature what are some issues you had along the way are the sales people really as bad as everyone thinks they are on your team you know what are some of the behind the scenes things that you can share with us um that take us again on that Journey with that conflict on how you did stuff I love hearing those things um I remember a rails comp talk that Upworthy did uh in 2014 and see I still remember it um and they talked about how they went I think it was from a monolith to having a bunch of microservices I think um and I loved being able to to hear how a company that I really enjoy um you know using and using their website how they did that how they broke it up and the problems they had and the you know internal conflicts they had amongst team members and how they're able to eventually you know untangle that we hear that problem and that solution a lot of how do you go from to microservices having someone say well this is exactly how I did it was awesome great clicking my microphone my pocket okay so I have one I think we're going to wrap it up soon um certainly if people I know there are some more questions posted in the chat it's hard for me to follow everything but uh I'm sure if people have additional questions you can ask them in the comments once this video is posted and also you could probably ask and follow s on Twitter you're more than welcome to @ sironar first name last name and I'll there'll be a link to that in this video description as well so I think this is a good kind of wrapup question which um I'm going to rephrase it but it came from Cody feler which is so I guess the question that I have I think is how do you get um how do you get like let's say you want to give Tech talks and you want to speak at conferences how do you get started how do you find Opportunities is there like a do you apply do you network do you go to conferences first like what what is that process sure so a lot of bigger Tech conferences will have a cfp we had a cfp as well um I think we had about applications for R cfp for like 20 to 30 spots um but a lot of conferences will have cfps I highly encourage you to submit to them it never hurts to um yes you will be nervous and terrified when you submit I literally cried the first time I was I was typing it up I hit the submit button I'm just crying and my husband's in the kitchen like why are you crying like cuz I don't know if I can do it so it's totally fine it's an emotional thing it's cool um that's one way the other way is meetups meetups are really really great place to get started meetups are almost always looking like actively looking for speakers to come in and give a short lightning talk 5 minutes 10 minutes uh lightning talks are a great way to kind of see how you feel you know standing in front of people and talking without a huge commitment you know without a 20 40 minute commitment so I think meetups are um a great way to do it also if you're working at a tech company in a tech role if your company does brown bag lunches that's a great opportunity to speak uh and if they don't do brown bag lunches you should start one and you should offer to coordinate them um and to you know give talks in the office as well those are some really good places to start great okay thank you everybody um I know this is a bit of a shorter live stream than my usual ranting and raving for like three and a half hours about some problem that I can't debug but um this is great I know it's always awkward to like come and do this like you're talking to a camera and you know what's going on here it's and it's hard to present in these context and this was really great and I hope that people um take something from this so again um I would really recommend that you subscribe to the code newbies podcast um and check out the code land conference uh if you have followup questions you can ask me on Twitter you can ask San on Twitter that'll that stuff will be in the video's description and um again uh if you're watching this live right now and you missed it just check back I would say tomorrow afternoon by then hopefully we'll have I don't know if I'm speaking out of turn here but sometime later this week sometimes soon we'll have an archived version of this video available and and perhaps even with that archived version I'll edit out this weird part now I have to like wander behind you and like click a button over here there's no other way to say goodbye oh also I'll be back on Friday let me just mention sorry I'll be back on Friday for my usual coding tutorial thing about the one thing that might this different just check back I'll it'll be on YouTube or on Twitter I might do the afternoon instead of the morning based on my schedule so that's what's coming up and we'll see you later okay thank you so much thanks everybody
