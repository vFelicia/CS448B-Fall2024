hello again okay before we get started with this video let's just take a moment to remind ourselves where we are we know about vectors we know the position or location of an object can be described as a vector how it moves over time is its velocity also a vector how the velocity changes over time also a vector called acceleration how do we compute acceleration force equals mass time acceleration acceleration equals force / Mass so the forces in the environment get accumulated into an object's acceleration which then changes velocity which then changes location that's where we are so this begs the question how do we calculate forces and what we've seen up until now is just making up numbers um let's just remind ourselves for a second right if we look at this example oh there's a force gravity 0 comma 0.3 fantastic there's another force wind 2 comma 0 these are forces we've just completely made them up however real forces exist in the real world uh and have uh actual formulas that you could find in textbooks I don't have a prop to just grab but um you find a textbook open it up and you will find formulas in it so the goal of this video is to say take a deep breath and say we could make up forces and that's perfectly great we can also try to model real world forces by looking at the formula trying to understand the formula and translating that formula into practical processing code or whatever environment you may be choosing to program in so the in this video we're going to look at um two case studies we're going to look at friction and what we'll call drag or a fluid or air resistance we're going to look at these forces that slow down an object when it's in motion with friction two surfaces coming in contact with each other or uh air resistance you can think of as something moving through the air and experiencing a resistance force from you know I don't know the air there's stuff there it blocks your way not too badly but anyway uh okay so let's talk about friction first so uh you're probably watching this in the summer on a beach somewhere like drinking a My Thai is that a drink I don't know some sort of Glorious fruity beverage but in New York City where it is right now it just snowed and this was a weekend where uh lots of kids were out sledding so let's think about a sledding scenario just for a moment we have a hill and we have a sled and a small child on the sled a little bit too much information for this and we have this object moving with a velocity so this object has a velocity Vector it's also experiencing a gravitational force we can say that's the force of gravity and What We Gather what we're here today to discuss is the fact that this sled is also experiencing friction the sled is in contact with the ice or the snow those two surfaces in contact there is a friction force and a friction Force moves is pushes the object in the opposite direction of its velocity that makes sense all right um uh friction is a force in the opposite direction of the way that you're moving if I could do the moonwalk here which I can't there would be some sort of friction in the opposite direction of the moonwalk right okay so can't believe I just did the moonwalk okay um now there's something else going on in this V in this video no this is this is a video this is a diagram and this diagram something called the normal force so you might remember Newton's third law which states for every option there's an equal and opposite reaction or maybe better stated as forces always occur in pairs so just as um I am exerting a force down onto the floor because gravity is pushing me down fortunately I'm not going through the floor there is a force pushing me back up these two forces acting in pairs so there is also a nor something called a normal force this would be called the normal which has to do with the force of gravity of force kind of keeping the sled from just going through this hill of snow okay so there's lots of stuff at play in this diagram and what I'm here to look at what we're here me you whoever there's nobody here it's just me okay what we're here to look at is what is the formula for the force of friction it equals 1 times something called mu if I wrote that correctly times the normal force that is the magnitude of that normal force so maybe I should by the way did we ever say this I think we had a video All About vector magnitude and I never bothered to mention that in Vector notation this is typically how we write a vector and when we want to talk about the length of that Vector we sometimes will write it as the vector with these uh vertical lines so the magnitude of the normal force times the velocity Vector so this is a Formula it's not that bad of a formula but what happens often when you see a formula is you look at it and you think hey I just make up the numbers in processing which is fine but in this case what we want what we want to do in this video is say we see am I recording I'm recording we see this formula and what what we want to do is unpack and find what are the actual parts of the formula that we really need can we boil it down right we if we were doing a really scientific uh simulation we would have to include all of these elements but what I want to look at Now is really what is friction and can we simplify this formula because after all what do we have on the screen like if we want to apply friction friction to this sketch there's just this ball bouncing so where's the normal force where's the velocity where maybe we can make this a little bit simpler okay so let's look at this for in a couple of ways one let's understand something about how we calculate forces when we know that a for a vector okay a force is a vector we know that a force is a vector so in our code we're going to have to do something like say p Vector friction equals and actually that should probably go down here that's going to be at the end we're going to do some calculations at the end we're going to end up with a vector that is friction but what is a vector an entity with magnitude and Direction so looking at this formula we have to ask ourselves what is the magnitude of friction how big is the friction force and what is the direction what is the direction of friction so from our diagram and how we described it we know that friction points in the opposite direction of velocity friction doesn't cause you to speed up it's a force against the way that you're moving thus the moonwalk anyway um so where in this formula is embedded the direction of friction and ah I messed something up the formula this is why sometimes it's good to like practice or plan these videos but right now I'm just kind of I feel very relaxed this morning and we're just kind of going going slowly we're going to go more slowly someone mentioned to me that these videos go a little bit fast try to go a little more slowly in this one okay what I meant to write here is the velocity unit Vector the normalized version of the Velocity Vector velocity unit vector and by the way talking about vector VOR syntax we said that ah this is how we say the magnitude of a vector v this is often how we write a unit vector v v with a carrot on top unit Vector a vector of length one the velocity Vector normalized to length one I said that eight times but you know that's me trying to go a little more slowly okay so what where were we we want to know the direction so we need to know the direction of this Vector d Direction whatever spelling is not my forte we need to know the direction of this Vector what is that is that embedded into this formula somewhere in fact yes it is it is in it is it is in two places velocity is a vector with a unit Vector with Direction negative 1 the opposite direction of velocity so we can see in that formula that 1 * the velocity unit Vector that's the object's that's I'm Excuse me the Force's Direction so we're going to get the forces's direction from there and if we think back to our processing code what could that mean friction equals velocity. getet can you can you read that kind of getting up too high I have to write a little lower velocity got get friction multiply oh forgot a step friction normalize friction multiply ne1 see so we see this formula we understand that one of the things about this formula we need is the direction of the vector the direction of the vector is the negative and the velocity unit vector and now we can rewrite that in processing code how what does that mean we say hey give me a copy of the Velocity this is very important this is something we've referred to before when we when we when when we're dealing with vectors right we don't want the object's actual velocity Vector because if we start manipulating the object's velocity Vector we've messed up how that object is moving we just want temporarily we're saying hey excuse me object I really hate to bother you and ask you but could I please have a copy of your velocity Vector because I need it to calculate the force of friction I don't want to mess with your velocity just give me a copy of it so we have the copy of and get a copy of a vector. getet so we have a copy of the velocity Vector then we normalize it right because in our formula it's the um it's the unit Vector velocity so once we have a copy of the Velocity Vector we can normalize it and then we can multiply it by negative 1 so it's moving in the opposite direction I was checking to see the time and I never press the timer so this video is going on for some amount of time I'm not sure about it okay so now we have the direction of friction we have a normalized vector in the correct direction now a vector is an entity with dire dire and magnitude what do we need next magnitude so this is where it gets kind of interesting what are the components of this Vector this force of this formula what are the components of this formula that give us the frictions magnitude they are mu and the magnitude of the normal force okay so someone's trying to get in everything could be okay they went away okay um so the magnitude so this is where things get a little tricky not really tricky actually this is where we decide let's not make things tricky let's make life easy on ourselves the normal force well there's probably trigonometry involved here there's a force pointing down but it's going on a slope and H you know the normal force so you know what's the mass of the sled and you know there all sorts of questions we could ask here but we want to live in a simple world right now we want to live in a simple world where it's just like this little ball bouncing you know what's the normal force the normal force I guess technically would be like pushing out from behind the screen against this circle but there's no screen I mean the screen the circle it's just pixels so what we can really say here is the normal force which is some component of the force of gravity and you know it's a constant and I have an even better idea it equals one normal force in our world normal force always equals one now now what's mu mu is the coefficient you can't read that at all of I'll rest start writing the coefficient of friction I got to get better at this board thing okay mu is the coefficient of friction so what might be some different coefficients of friction well the coefficient of friction is going to determine how strong that friction is is it two blocks of ice is it two is it sandpaper and uh you know a textbook Is It Michael Jackson and the moonwalk like what is the sort of what what kind of objects are coming into contact so if there if sandpaper is going to have a high coefficient of friction there's a lot of friction going along sandpaper ice is going to have a very low coefficient of friction it's very slippery you can just slide right on it so we could probably I don't know go out into the field and do some tests and come up with some numbers but what we are really doing here in processing is saying there's going to be a lot of friction or there's going to be a little friction the normal force uh the normal force affects that too right a really massive object pushing down a lot and with a big normal force pushing up is going to have more friction than a very light thing but you know later we'll look at Mass there's all sorts of things we can um we could add to this to make it more complicated but for right now this is what we can do with formulas we can really simplify them we can say these are constants let's make them up as constants let's make up a variable called C let's say it's 0.01 that's myod coefficient of friction and then let's say friction multiply by that coefficient now check we're done ah okay we're done we looked at a diagram we looked at the formula we figured out what are the parts of the formula for direction velocity in the normalized in the other direction what are the components for the magnitude some constants let's make up a constant to either have the friction weak are strong and you know we could control this with a slider a variable it could change different objects could have different coefficients of friction and then we multiply we scale that Vector accordingly and then what do we do next apply Force so I'm going to uh now that we've done this let's look at actually applying it in our code and I'll give you an exercise uh okay here we are over here so if you recall um this particular example had has gravity and wind right and we're applying gravity always and we're only applying wind when I click the mouse now you can see the wind is being applied so let's let's just change a couple things one thing is let's just say let's apply gravity and wind always and I'm like okay and now we're going to say let's apply friction so right here we're going to do everything we did on the board to apply friction to this object okay so what do we need to do first the direction of the vector we did this already friction equals the movers velocity. getet so we've got a copy now of the object's velocity Vector now we want to normalize it and multiply it by negative 1 great and then what do we do coefficient of friction oh this is so easy 0.1 scale it things are falling apart and then you know what look at this uh sorry I don't want a trip I'm coming right back hello again um I really am going slow I think I'm going slowly in this video I feel a little like lethargic today um look how we're multiplying by negative 1 and then we're multiplying by this coefficient it's kind of unnecessary let's just make the coefficient a negative number and now we've got m. apply Force C uh not C sorry okay don't this pen cannot sit over here I have a new Podium thing and it's kind of H now we're going to apply the friction Force okay so we get the velocity we normalize it we reverse its direction and scale it according to some magnitude and then we apply it if we run this look friction can you tell that there's friction kind of hard to tell right so let's just let's sort of like look at this and make this a little bit more let's let's make this a little more apparent let's only apply apply the friction when we are pressing the mouse and let's actually um let's take out the uh wind for a moment and I think also this is a little bit silly but if I have the Mover start at the top of the screen okay so there is now our ball that is falling up and down up and down and now when I click the mouse we're going to apply friction let's see not not much of a change a little change let's make the friction the nice thing about we've done is maybe the friction needs to be a lot stronger and by the way the Mover has a random Mass so let's give it a not so Random Mass okay oh and it has a random location uh let's give it I just want to make it consistent for a second so we can kind of look at this should have done this in advance okay ready and now let's apply some friction you can see now that friction is causing it to kind of like slow down and stop right it's actually the weird thing about this this is a terrible demonstration right because what's really good like this this we just simulated friction which would be as if it's like sliding along the the the the processing window itself but really what we should be simulating with something falling is air resistance so you know maybe we there there's so many so here's the thing what we did in this video and I know I I Pro this this could be this this isn't the best video we've ever made I've ever made let's let's just be honest here but it's it's going to do for right now what we did in this video is we figured out how to put this friction formula into a processing sketch now the question is for you and maybe what you could do as an exercise is design a scenario where this could actually make sense what if you had a think of a game like a platform Style game where something is moving along a surface and they're actually would be friction along that surface maybe it depending on like different parts of it encounters something with friction so um uh let me actually describe to you what I mean here so let's just say as an exercise here's your processing window think of there being this kind of ground and you have objects moving along that ground um what if it comes into different contact with different patches when it reaches this patch this is perhaps like mud or quicksand or sandpaper something really rough the rest of this is like ice over here could you create this sort of variable friction as something is moving along so this might be a nice scenario for you to try to build with friction and what we're actually going to do in the next video is create an appropriate Force for something that's falling we're going to look at air resistance what air resistance is very similar to friction but air fluid resistance but it's quite it's actually a different formula and it operates differently so that's what we're going to look at in the next video okay so hopefully this uh I don't know added something to your life you didn't just waste the last I've know for all I know this has been like 45 minutes um but it's probably more like 10 minutes and um see if you could create this scenario I I send me an email if I haven't made this example and added it to the nature of code get repository because I don't have an example that does this but I think it would make sense and um you know we'll be in touch somehow someday you you know there'll be little seats here and you can sit probably not maybe okay I I got to press a button to end this video
