all right so this video is about a giant topic one I know very little about and that topic is CSS and so you know there's been a bunch of videos here that I made about the Dom the document object model web pages HTML pages javascript how they control HTML pages let's just take a step back for a moment and and look at the pieces we know about and what's this third piece that I'm adding so this web page this thing that you're seeing in the browser or in the sort of browser window of the p5.js editor where I'm writing all the code there the thing that this page loads is a file called index.html okay so and this is not a good pen I'm switching pens in this file there is some content written into that file for example there is a header that's at the top of the page there's a paragraph this file is also referring to some JavaScript code it's referring to a bunch of different things like the p5.js library file our own code which is in a file called sketch da Chasse and in those files were doing some JavaScript stuff like making a canvas drawing a circle to that canvas and perhaps even as we've seen in previous videos making other dumb elements like more paragraphs and affecting those and changing those elements so you can think of these pieces as HTML this is really the structure and you could also say like initial content in a way like what's on the page when it first loads of that webpage javascript is logic code things that can handle events store information make all sorts of magic happen this is what you can think of as the behavior of the page so this is where you or and I and everybody else who's doing this stuff is writing code to control what's happening on that page over time based on user interaction based on some mathematical algorithm based on whatever you might fancy you'd like to draw rainbows into canvas unicorns do that with jobs Natick unicorns to my repertoire here only that rainbows okay so a bit in the last piece here that I want to talk about is this idea of CSS and CSS stands for cascading style sheets I don't know why they're cascading probably has to do with some sort of like nesting and whatever somebody on the internet who really knows this stuff will hopefully write in the comments why it's cascading but the key word there is style so if you want to affect various aspects of the layout of this page you want the canvas to actually float on the right side of the page rather than the left side of the page you want to change the font that's in the paragraphs you want to change the background color of a paragraph you want to any just about anything that you can imagine that has to do with the visual look and feel of that page can be controlled with this idea of CSS now once again we're in the same place as we were with HTML you could write HTML into that index dot HTML file or you could dynamically from insert HTML elements into the page using Java Script you could write you can sort in give some initial content you can also control those elements using Java Script the same thing is true with CSS there is a kind of file that can work enough there is a kind another kind of file you could write I've disappeared from the world but I am still here you cannot see me but I am still here I will never leave it still everyone last person on earth actually most people on earth don't really need to know about CSS or maybe they should I don't really know I that was a terrible idea but you're here watching this video maybe CSS is useful to you I'm going to keep going umm the HTML file the JavaScript file now you can also add information about styles to another kind of file named maybe style name whatever you want dot CSS js4 JavaScript dot HTML for HTML dot CSS now we're in what I meant by saying we're in the same situation is I want to talk about how do you add that I'll stuff to style that CSS and that are and or how much you add style dynamically on the fly based on user interaction based on some sub behaviors in JavaScript this is the bigger picture here and then there's lots of details to fill in it boy am i rambling about this but hopefully it's making some sense okay so how does CSS work CSS works on assessing a couple different principles one is this idea of a selector so you need to have a selector meaning what are the things that you want to select to style do you want to select all the paragraphs on the page do you want to select just this one particular paragraph do you want to select the canvas do what what Dom elements do you want to select in order to style after you said after you specify that selector so for example let's say you want to style all the paragraph elements on the page your selector would be P then you need some open and close curly brackets much like you always do when you're doing these kinds of things to denote the beginning and end of the stuff that will the style information that will be applied to that paragraph once you have that all you need are a series of name value pairs looks kind of like a JavaScript object but the syntax is a little bit different these name value pairs are like what's the property you want to style and what's the value for that style for example I want to style the background color and I want the background color to be black or white that's white I want it to be like pinkish f0f so you could be asking your question like oh my god what oh well what is that that looks terrifying to me there's like a pound symbol and then a letter and then a number so there's a lot of things to learn this is a certain kind of special way of writing a color information you know I think maybe this would have been a little bit simpler if I just wrote the word pink here or purple here that would also work there a variety of different ways so now the question is what are the kinds of things that can go here you know font size is one of them I think so if I want to like change the font size there's so much that could go how do you know what the possibilities are how do you add that to your CSS and then how do you do that with JavaScript how much time do we have I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go to the code and look at how that some of this works okay I've disappeared but I'm gonna come back to life sunshine rain down upon me and give me some light and I shall appear now in front of the camera okay I have to turn this down okay so here I am with a p5.js project in the p5.js editor I'm going to run this and you can see there again or back here I have this h1 element this paragraph element this canvas another paragraph element a button some of these elements are written here into the HTML body right in advance these are HTML elements that appear on the page as soon as it loads some of these elements are created with JavaScript made dynamically when the program runs create a paragraph create a button okay this is where we are how do I start to style it style that paragraph okay so actually um what I'm going to do even though I said over here come back even though I said over here you can create a separate CSS file I'll do that in a later video what actually is button to the hi little hyperactive what actually I think I would like to do is show you how you can actually add CSS style information directly into the HTML page so inside of this head tag where I'm referring to JavaScript files I could also potentially refer to some style information so what's that syntax paragraph I want to select all of the paragraphs on the page and assign them a background color which is purple I wish I could type a rainbow there do you think it works if I type rainbow there I doubt it okay so now if I save and I run this again we can see look this paragraph element has a purple background this paragraph element has a purple background you know it's very hard for me to see the text so I think if I say this color it refers to the color of the text inside the paragraph I think and now you can see I have white text with a purple background it looks a little crowded in there so something that I might add to this is some padding and how much padding how about eight pixels px for pixel so I'm going to do this look I look at this I've got some nice padding now so this is the basic idea of CSS I need to select something on the page and then give it some properties what's the property what's the value what's the property what's the value how do you know what all these possible properties are well you need to look this stuff up you can get books you watch other videos that where someone really knows about CSS is talking about this but um but and this is worried so let's look for this briefly in a moment and I have a couple more minutes left I am going to uh so I am on here developer dot Mozilla uh um so this is one place I'll put some links in the description for this video but here is a URL of where I could find some information about CSS I'm going to remove this part here this is a CSS reference there's a tutorial there's demos I want to look at the ref and exhaustive I've exhausted already an exhaustive reference I'm gonna look at the exhaustive reference and I'm going to see like look these are all of the possible things I could add there's so much I just keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling but we can look under I can look for like background color and you can see background color is right over here I can click on it and what do I see now I see here are some examples of different ways that I can call background color could say red I could say RGB I could say current all sorts of ways so this is a topic for another time or another video for you to look on your own there's another CSS reference that I like to use if I could find it in my history here I think it's this one right so I'll include a link to this this is a nice reference of all sorts of possible parameters in CSS the things that I want to focus on in in my videos is less about the full encompassing of all of the CSS reference and more about two things one is this how do these selectors work what are other ways that I could specifically address a single paragraph are only some paragraph there's a lot of ways you can use these selector so I want to get to that and the other thing I want to get to is how do you do style dynamically in JavaScript so with p5.js specifically so let's take at least another video I'm one of my future videos I'm going to talk more about selectors but in this particular video I want to look at the style function so here if I come back if I quit Chrome for a second and I come back to this we can see that these particular elements now these paragraph elements are all styled based on the hardcoded style information that's in the HTML file inside of the style tags but another thing I can do is right over here I can for any HTM any element that I create with p5 and later and show you any element that I access in p5 whether it was created or not I can call a function called style which then requires just two arguments what are those arguments the name of the style property the value of the style property so if I were to put right here in quotes background color and then I were to say in here in quotes pink you can see look at this this particular element is still getting the style from the HTML page this particular element woop I'm not there this particular element down here is getting the style from my code so when I apply a piece of styling dynamically in code it's going to overwrite the style that was originally set up in the HTML page so there's a lot of pieces here and for you essentially you're following these videos along what I would suggest you do is try adding some style to the HTML file in the same way a that I did here try adding some styles this way what other tags might you reference try adding some styles this way what happens if you add styles to other kinds of elements that aren't just paragraph elements and lastly and I'll do this for you really quickly set something style with an event okay let's think about this for example what if I say what if I were to say button dot mousepressed change style right so now I am attaching the change style event to the press of this button and what is that change style event it's a function that I need to write write the code inside this function right here will execute when I click the mouse on that button and maybe I'll change the text style to pink and maybe I'll give it a lot more padding because who doesn't love padding jazz hands I don't know I feel like that's going to be the desk JavaScript that musical that's my first song who doesn't love padding you're with me on that okay so now if we look at this everything's got its default style I'm going to trigger that event I got some more padding and a pink background so and you know maybe what I want to do I just got to do a little bit more say text mouse over change style oops and then I'll say button I'll say text Mouse out revert style and what I can do here and I'm going to I'm just showing you some other things a revert style and background purple padding eight pixels so let's take out the button event for a second I'm using Mouse out and mouse over a mouse over I'm Mouse out I mouse over I'm Mouse out I mouse over that's a very rhythmic so you can see here that you can start to highlight things make things happen based on button presses based on mouse over out based on the movement of a slider as we saw in the previous video so many possibilities so now you have something to work with try adding some style to the HTML page try adding some style using the style function see what types of elements what types of designs you can make and I'm going to come back and look at this again and again and again in several videos looking at other different types of scenarios with more events and more ways of selecting elements which classes and ID's is the topic for that and just as a reminder go and look in those references that will be linked below as to where you can find all this stuff so I'm five minutes over time not that that is relevant to you especially if you're watching this sometime in the future like in the year 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in my my childhood the year 2000 seemed very far away the year 3000 is a be watching this because you're watching this is a year 3000 please go get my brain out of that cryogenic thing that it's in and I don't know yeah do something with it talk to me about rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you in a future video
