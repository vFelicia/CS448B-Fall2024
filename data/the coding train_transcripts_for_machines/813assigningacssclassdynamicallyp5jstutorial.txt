so I've missed a I think two important details in this little rather long series now about HTML CSS and Dom manipulation in p5 that I would like to kind of fill in some gaps and so here is a scenario that I think will fill in one particularly important gap that I want to first talk about which is we have looked at how a class is a way of selecting a group of Dom elements but what if those Dom elements aren't things that are written into the HTML file here is an example where I have used a for loop to make a hundred paragraphs with the word apples in them and a hundred paragraphs with the word blueberries in now we saw in a previous video how I could assign an event to all those paragraphs but what if I wanted to style all those paragraphs well certainly I could use P dot style and add things to that and this will dynamically encode style all the elements but what if I had previously spent a lot of time working out very elaborate now here I haven't done that because I just have one piece of style information but you have a CSS file that you got from a friend or you just spent a lot of time preparing a lot of style information in CSS what if when you create those elements you want to assign all of them this particular style that's already written into your style CSS your style information in the HTML file well it turns out that in the same way that I could create a paragraph that is that has a particular class associated with it this is how I would do that in HTML I can also do that when I make the element in JavaScript so what I can do here is I can say this particular paragraph that I've made that I've given a random position in the window I can also say make it a member of the class Apple and make thee all of these a member of the class blueberry so now when we look at this you can see all of the apple pear our styled with a red background and all the blueberry paragraphs are styled with a blue background this is perhaps the ugliest web page anyone has ever made and you the watcher of this video will have a beautiful design sense and all sorts of interesting ideas but so you can see you can push I would I would try to do this see if you can now create an artificially create a scenario for yourself where you want to make all of the CSS all the styling here in the CSS and you want to and you want to then generate the elements in JavaScript and assign them a class you could also by the way switch classes midstream oh this is exciting let's try this so what if I did something like and I'm gonna actually make this create a I'm gonna show you another thing this is we haven't really looked at the create a tag but the create a tag is a way of creating an anchor tag now normally you might put something like if I do this right I'm making a whole lot of elements with the word blueberries in them that are links anchor links to google.com so if I do this you can see now anytime I click on one of these blueberries I've got the Google Website because I'm clicking on the web I'm clicking on the term it goes to Google a trick that you can use is using the pound symbol meaning don't actually go anywhere instead I'm gonna handle that in JavaScript boy I really gone off the deep end here but this I think is kind of an interesting scenario now what if I say now suppress change you know become Apple so now I'm gonna make a function called become Apple and I say this dot class Apple so what I'm saying is all of these Dom elements were created to be blueberries but if I press on them they become apples and remember the magic of the key word this this is something that p5 does for you if you a callback as if you pass a function as a callback to a Dom element and you're doing that the same callback to many Dom elements the this keyword will know which Dom element actually triggered that event so this particular Dom element should become a member of the class Apple let's fix let's do a couple things to this first of all let's say I want to say font size actually all of let's say all the paragraphs should have I just so we can see it a little better font size of 24 point and a color of white since you've got these red backgrounds so now if we run this did I not oh those knock paragraphs oh you know what yeah I don't know why that didn't work let me just put it in here Oh cuz class might I don't know I'm somebody will correct me I shouldn't live coding while I'm making these videos it's very dangerous okay so you can see it lets make less of them let's just make ten of each of them now remember all of the blueberries now any blueberry when I click on it when I click on the blueberry the become Apple function will be triggered we'll change it to be of the member class didn't work do I have an error P great class blueberry mouse press become Apple this class Apple I have like a failure again this is so sad I'm gonna I'm gonna just add some stuff here let's make sure let's fix this live there's no wonder my failed videos so how do you do bug this sort of problem this makes sense right mouse pressed become Apple trigger this code change its class to Apple I should see it visually look different on the page so let's at least make sure this code is happening console.log this is happening and by the way instead of console.log i could just say print line so let's do let's run this again click on blueberries so that is happening now what is now this dot class apple should change its styling information I wonder if it's actually just adding the class Apple not not changing it I wonder if I have it so one thing that I've realized I think that I have a conceptual problem here which is that dumb elements can be members of different classes so let's let's discover if this is true by saying also like an apple I'm going to give it I'm going to give an Apple a certain amount of padding so you can see all the apples have padding but the blueberries do not look the blueberry got the patch it did change to an apple but it's still blue why did it change it's because oh i've off the deepend in this video into the into the nether region of whatever but a Dom elements can actually members of multiple classes so when I said class Apple I didn't say remove the class blueberry and become an apple I simply said also become a member of the group Apple now blueberry says to be blue apple says to be red blueberry says to have no padding Apple says to have a lot of padding well if this object is both a blueberry and an apple it was a blueberry first so it's gonna be blue forever and ever but blueberries don't have any padding so since it doesn't have any padding it will be an apple when it comes to padding and you can see that that's now what's happening now there probably is I you know a p5 function called whoops I maybe there's a p5 function called remove class and this would now say I didn't work so I was going to look I was gonna get that wrong and then look in the reference for this function but if I wanted to only be an apple I need to first remove the class blueberry you know I went off on a tangent and I had some problems that I had to debug in then I had to think about why I might be wrong and it all magically has worked in the end which is great but what let's let's let's meditate for a second go back to why we're here the point of what I was trying to show you was a missing piece is that classes and ID's are things that you often want to build into the HTML page so you can access elements from JavaScript but now we're seeing that the inverse is also true classes and ID's are things that might exist in the HTML page part of your CSS and you sometimes want to assign those in JavaScript and what's kind of exciting about those is you can assign them and you can take them away so um this is kind of a useful thing I could also do something like oh okay so that's that's item number one now there is another aspect of this another aspect of this is that oh that I missed in and you know what actually no that's fine I'm gonna no that's good so that's good for this video here's here's my suggestion to you for an exercise I'm gonna make this into two videos I think always Lyc second another video is better then just keep going so here's my exercise for you do something similar create for yourself a whole lot of Dom elements or may actually you know it here's an exercise so you do it differently than what I did here make a bunch of Dom elements like five of them six of them in your HTML file give them all classes and assign them styling information based on those classes in the CSS now in your JavaScript select them you select all by class and then build in some event that changes their class so you can dynamically style them adding and removing classes as well so that that's kind of an exercise that I think you could try and in the next video I'm gonna show you one more missing piece which is how you can use parent and child with a p5 variable not just with an ID and what that might allow you to do
