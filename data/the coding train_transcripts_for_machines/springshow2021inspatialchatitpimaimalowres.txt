well hello there everyone i am just doing a quick mic check i will be getting started in approximately one minute and six seconds let me know in the chat if you can hear the audio just fine this is not your usual coding live stream tonight this is a broadcast of the itp ima lores at nyu tisch school of the arts spring 2021 show so i'll explain more about that once i get started sorry about that one more minute until i get started one more song here to play do do hello and happy tuesday evening i'm here at my desk prepare to broadcast the news no not the news i'm actually here to broadcast the itp ima low res spring show of 2021 a festival of the recently possible now here's the thing typically um in the past if you've ever seen one of my biannual it's biannual twice a year or every other year you let me know in the chat but twice a year i will broadcast uh the show of the wonderful students from the itp ima and now low res program at tisch school of the arts new york university located right here where i am sitting in brooklyn new york typically this is a live inperson show and i'm wandering around with a mobile camera trying to somehow like do all of my internet wifi dances properly so that the stream can broadcast but um here we are once again uh now i think this is the third time that the itp ima lores show is online but it's pretty different today so what i'm doing right now is is kind of in some sense useless because what i really would much prefer that you do i would you know you're not supposed to say this when you're live streaming or making a video but turn this off and go and to and join the show yourself so i need to figure out um i'm going i think if i take this link no i'm in the wrong place ah no i'm good no wrong yes i think i can do this sorry i'm about to put into the chat um and hopefully you're not gonna hear this good i'm about to paste into the chat the link to the show itself i'm typing this now you're actually seeing this like way before you're gonna hear me say this because of the way the delay is i don't know what's the future what's the past but that's the actual link that you can go and join the show yourself i'm actually going to also edit the video and just go to the video description and paste the link now in the video description i'm going to hit save so if you were to refresh the page that you're on um in addition to seeing the link in the chat um and i don't know youtube is like yelling at me like it's not it's got an error but let's see if this worked yes so now in this video's description is the link to the actual show itself so in just a moment i'm going to go in there myself and show you how it all works where you can find the project where you can chat with the creators of the project then i will continue to stream and wander around but you could experience this stream in your own way just by being in the show itself i'm just checking out the chat um saying hello to tom g who says hello saying hello to wucha and thomas smith and gregor biennial versus biannual biennial like the venice biennale is every two years by annual every six months i really hope i can remember that in the future because i would love to be able to call upon that knowledge when needed because i is there an equivalent for biweekly is there by weekly by bimonthly by i don't know carson is here hey all right so um let's throw caution to the wind and just get started with what um i don't know i don't have a lot of other stuff to say i could talk about you know coding train news and updates there will be a regularly scheduled live stream this thursday but i'm going to switch over here and i am now uh in uh spatial chat itself so uh if you might remember that last time i live streamed a uh online version of the itbiamalorez show we were using something called yorb um without by accident going into oh wait i can hear somebody i thought the oh oh oh oh i thought that the microphones were disabled in this room but i guess if you're a host it's not i've i've stopped i've muted the audio so you can't hear it i gotta go i gotta i gotta go to a different welcome room this is too destructive wait no i can do this great all right here we are yorb was a 3d world created by um a bunch of developers and artists and students and researchers at the itb program itself spatial chat from what i understand is a third party commercial system i think there's a way to use it for free but let's see if i can kind of like walk you through how spatial chat works so basically the way that it works is and you can see here this is um there's a whole bunch of rooms and soon i'm gonna start going into the rooms to view the various projects but we can look here and sort of see um how it works so audio and video is spatial so this is me right now i can move myself around notice how these other circles get larger and smaller if we were in a room where the audio and video was not disabled then we would see the video appear as we got closer and disappear as we got further the audio would get louder and quieter depending on our distance um the other thing we can note here is that each room has a theme six projects in each room each project has their own area labeled with the name and project title so this is what it's going to look like i wonder if i can zoom in any further on this i can do my own zoom so we're going to start to move around and find projects and there'll be videos being shared and there's the creators of the project will be there that i can interview and ask some questions um um you can see here you if you if you join right here's the url once again it's in the chat and i don't think i pinned it let me pin it in the chat and replace the pin message so now that's pinned you can find the url right there is anybody watching right now are any of you in welcome room a are these any of your circles floating around i would be excited and hello to grant from utah utah the time zone that this is meant for perhaps because i know a lot of the viewers that regular viewers of the coding train or in europe or asia and other parts of the world and plenty of other uh places that just are it's you know the middle of the night are quite late right now so thank you to anyone who happens to be tuning in let's see what else we can find out help and map um navigate the directory uh and desk for the project map you will also find helpers if you have questions or need support by the way uh let's see how many people do i have um vicky lou says that they are there let's see if we can find vicky this is where i am oh no no wait this is where i am vicki come over near here and let's see your icon now of course once i actually start guarding the rooms with audio and video i might not be so encouraging of you to come and interrupt but yeah you should you should come and say i'm just slightly afraid of the live broadcast aspect of doing this um is anybody from itp ima or lores watching this right now if you are say hi in the chat but really come on go into the spatial chat so i've been told that there's a limit of 500 people on the spatial chat and i um i kind of have a personal mission to see if we can get it above 500. i can see right now there are 89 people watching this stream or um which is um a wonderful amazing number of people if i'm being honest but also a little bit lower than i usually will have for a live stream probably the time uh is a little bit of a barrier there for a lot of people but um wessie is there um and maybe this is oh that's wesley um and i i don't know where did i go here i am so all right so let's go we're now in welcome room hey i gotta ease my way in i mean welcome room a i'm gonna ease my way in and um uh yes and i see also just just to respond to carson in the chat who writes i really should be doing college right now what does it mean to do college by the way i would like to do college that sounds like fun i did i did college once upon a time many moons ago oh boy i'm old okay i really should be doing college right now but maybe i could watch your streams more during the summer yes first of all take care of yourself take care of your own wellbeing drink water rest take care of your work study be with your friends and family and loved ones and then if you happen to have a little bit of extra time left over you could join a coding train stream that's what i would say that should be your priority list um and algeria is in the house zach from algeria and uh christopher chenier all right we're getting some announcements actually let's tune into these announcements the the projects in those rooms i believe there's just a little bit of a check of the audio do you hear both of the announcements that's going on and me and then to navigate you can actually move your bubble around um the closer you get to somebody the louder the sound is it's almost as if i'm actually sitting in these seats um and then you can also move this if you click on the background marvel give me a call look at these special effects i've got going and if you want to unmute if you have any questions feel free to unmute yourself as well okay we're going to welcome room b right now and i'm going to mute the spatial uh chat audio all right when welcome room b oh i guess the welcome rooms all have the same thing welcome room c i somehow i imagine the welcome rooms had different images um so okay maybe maybe just maybe we're ready to go into directory and info desk oh i played a sound effect and you didn't hear it okay let's try this again maybe just maybe i feel ready everyone oh oh we've got more now to the show you're looking if you're a little confused on how to navigate let me go back to this room okay hold on welcome roommate okay inside the column all right let me welcome room b now maybe come on i have a bit to do here maybe we feel ready now to go into the directory and info desk right shall we do it what do you all think what do you think what do you think all right i'm going to mute the audio of i'm like very afraid oh wait look i everybody knows i just i don't love the idea of like broadcasting this space without people's consent and so um you know i'm going to be very mindful of that i mean this is a public online space so people are hopefully just generally aware that they are being watched and could be recorded but the students are aware that i'm going to be visiting their project and i've also prepared a sign to appear on my face that says live broadcast so here we go uh twirling tech goddess is in the house and i really there's just no way that you could possibly be referring to my hair i don't think any i'm just gonna got to be somebody else right because i know it's getting a little bit long and i've got my little streak of gray and eventually hopefully if it stays it will be all silver at some point and i'm very excited for those days if i'm still a person who's doing things on youtube you will appreciate this twirling tech god goddess because my tshirt says don't hate wait hold i gotta go to this view don't hate roller skate all right um where am i here i am all right now we're going into the directory and info desk it's like 8 15 i haven't looked at a project yet okay uh here we go directory and info desk here we are i'm going to turn on my camera here i am i'm going to go to the corner just for a second to be by myself i'm turning on my mic and then i'm going to zoom in and this is me see this is my now i'm seeing it mirrored because um spatial chat wants to show me my image mirrored which makes a lot of sense by the way this camera that you're seeing here right now is the different than this camera right like i can cover my camera the camera that's in spatial chat is the camera that's on my laptop but where i'm broadcasting this from open broadcast studio is this camera over there hi this camera over there camera one i only have one camera someday i'll have more than one camera so i can do the bit where i go camera two come on let's talk we gotta talk camera two but there's there's no camera two right now so i can't do that all right back to here so i think i can remove myself as i move around because this is me right here i am the live broadcast um and now we're in um let's see let's go uh let's go like if you have social anxiety this is really like i don't know if live streaming to the internet and weirdly it's like easier for me to do that than uh walk into a room full of people but um uh let's go wander over and say hi to some folks oh hello i'm a live broadcast everybody be careful hi hello well hello shipping oh this is the let's see is the audio the audio is going through to my live broadcast i've got my sign that says i'm a live broadcast so everybody knows everybody's okay we've got a chat going mostly people are joining the live broadcast and then i'm steering them here so if you are watching the live broadcast right now here is your link right here on the screen chat slash s slash spring show 2021 you could jump right in here and invade the live broadcast you know be kind uh how's everybody doing tonight this is like such a nice crew of folks i'm i'm i'm having like a just a very small minor fit of anxiety and panic here but it's everything as we circle you is there anything we can do to help no no no that's my that's my uh uh baseline so things are actually quite good um and i'm i'm okay and um i'm i'm slow like for a while i just spent the time in the welcome rooms where you couldn't um speak or hear other people and then now we changed that yeah oh oh that was nice though it was a good way to ease into spatial chat so now i'm in the directory room and i i'm working up the courage to go to i think my first stop is going to be virtual reality you're brave dan you're so brave have fun thank you all right everyone i'm going to go over here so they don't have to hear me um i am now going ahead let's go look we're going to head over to vr where there are these um let's see how far can i zoom in um we're there and i i was meaning not to show people's names here um we're gonna head over to vr where we have these one two oh i'm pointing the wrong way i'm looking the whole reason why i don't have my video flipped is because i can look i guess i could go over here here we go this is very obviously this is like making all the difference in your viewing experience must point correctly uh ah julia ann myers is in the vr room i think the last time i think i've interacted with julia before but julia you are a lowres student at the itp ima lores program so many names and acronyms what does it all mean ask in the chat i'm happy to try to answer that um julia cyberspace three julia if it's all right with you let's head over to your project first because um yeah why not okay we're heading over to julia's project um so i'm going to the vr room and now i am i just got plopped in what is history it's many parallel streams of events which meet at certain points so why not create them as parallel structures that makes it easier to write easy to read so to me the computer was an opportunity to radically redefine the nature of writing this is a really cool movie okay can you hear me yeah i'm not sure if we're allowed to talk i got so much audio going on um yeah let me give you a little demo so this is a video in the middle but i'm going to open up this screen here um because this is the actual live demo and so you can visit the site so i've gotten basically last time you stream me my aframe skills were very rudimentary um this is all aframe this is uh yeah print out some more features so aframe is a programming language yeah so aframe is for writing or creating vr uh do you know 3js like the javascript library so it basically uses that library so you can create like a frame which is a like vr in the browser so like right now what you can see here okay so this is running in the browser right now so you can actually use this with uh a headset an oculus headset or just in the browser and um yeah so basically this time i experimented with like interaction and it's exploration of like pixels and screens and space and all that um so yeah it was really fun um i did a lot of work in after effects and a lot of this all this is is an aframe though um again the loading times down was a miracle i'm getting some questions from some folks about what is aframe could you could you give a quick like um highlevel uh uh explanation of what aframe is yeah sure so aframe uh basically allows you to host vr in the browser so for a lot of your projects you have to have like an oculus or a headset and for this it makes a lot more accessible so anyone can like open up their browser even on your phone and stuff and like this is running yeah right now in chrome chrome is recommended um and you can have a whole vr project there and there's a lot of really cool uses for it um because you can basically have this kind of like 360 ability to create in 360 for the web which i think is very cool um yeah and it so it works on time based so it's timed out in javascript so after like 30 seconds each room moves on yeah that's my little project so but a frame is very cool and a lot easier than you'd think it's all in html so um like inside html so i'd recommend oh wow okay so you wait so you make the aframe is the language powered by 3js in html i i just started i mean just yeah it sounds kind of crazy yeah yeah but basically yeah basically you're working with like entities which are making kind of these 3d objects in a space but it's coded i don't think that they're saying it's like i'm just going to interrupt for a second here um and oh wait a sec uh sorry i meant to mute myself here and i muted myself in the wrong place i'm not interrupting here i'm interrupting someone else cook as you were all good yeah all right go ahead the wrong button again okay now we're all good i i i thought i was doing so well with the technology i've got like audio and multiple computers here and streaming i i just wanted to answer some of the questions in the chat because i think people are all confused about what you're watching so there is at this moment going on in uh in a in a shared space called spatial chat you can go to spatial dot chat s spring show 2021 link in the description and pinned in the chat the end of semester show for the itp ima and lores programs at nyu tisch school of the arts just wanted to reset the room here for a moment um julian is asking what does itp and ima stand for so itp stands for interactive telecommunications program it's a twoyear master's program and ima stands for interactive media arts which is a a fouryear bachelor's of fine arts it's an undergrad program so um hopefully i've linked to those programs in the video's description but if you go to itp.nyu.edu you'll find out there and so ultimately really this is just a a show that you can go and wander around and chat with students and see their projects in a virtual space normally this would be um physically an inperson show in brooklyn new york but um you know here we are in living in 2021 um and a global pandemic so the uh the the show is online for this semester spatial chat is a service that i have nothing to do with that it ima has nothing to do with it's a um like a browserbased multiuser chat video audio spatially oriented system i'm sure we could find out more about it if i looked on their about page um that the department is using for the show all right i'm gonna jump back into the show and listen to what julia is saying yeah and then you just type in the uh the name of my project but you can see it but unfortunately so the interaction i'm adding interaction for oculus controls in like the final version like my thesis is due in july so this is uh like very much a prototype still but so you will be able to interact with the boxes and stuff but you can like click but yeah that'll be final version so okay all right i can't wait i uh i i only you know i can't wait to try this out i'm like oh my gosh i just got in here yeah last night but uh is this going to be available like after 10 o'clock oh the website yeah yeah it will be up okay yeah thanks for stopping by this is great yeah no i'm glad this live broad what's the show called with the rainbows oh the coding train you gotta check it out when you start talking i was like okay it's great no i'm sorry about that i have like a million different controls for like live streams i have the audio from my live stream and i pressed the wrong button but actually julia what i did is actually people were asking a little confusion so i was like resetting the room a bit and i explained what itp and ima are but i didn't really say too much about the low res i don't want to take up too much of your time but yeah could you just talk about what the the low res program for 30 seconds what an electronic document what it's for or what are you know for one thing yeah what it's like for you your own experience yeah for sure yeah it's been really cool so this is like the first year of it so it's a brand new program but i think it's a great way of kind of meeting bridging the gap so it's only one year and you basically do every semester and it's been online from the intention is that you get to experience different campuses and um yeah i love because it's like uh interactive media arts it's also my undergrad major and so i feel like i got so into it that's why i love being able to kind of continue what i was doing and what i was looking into with the uh with the masters but yeah so it's one year i like that's very small you really like have great relationships with professors and all that and um but yeah uh awesome no that's true no no that's perfect that's really helpful yeah yeah and i will um put a link in the youtube chat and uh for people who are interested in finding out more about the program awesome thank you for being the guinea pig this is the first project that i stopped by so i'm gonna go wander around and find some other projects to look at thanks so much yeah have fun thanks for stopping by all right so i'm back to here um and i have someone walking around directly in space yeah cool so now i should be able to move around let's go back in i'm just going to move over here into spatial chat you can't see what i'm doing here i am i'm just moving over here where i don't see a lot of people so i can have a little bit of a break and figure out where i'm going to go next um so i i want to come back to the vr room if i can um because there are more um projects here actually let me see let me see if actually um looks like marianne is there let's see if we can stop by marianne's project um briefly so i'm going to switch to this view i'm going to unmute myself and now i'm going to move back over here and hello is anybody here anybody home hi yes hi how are you oh wait wait wait i messed up my audio buttons okay now i can hear hi dan i'm just saying hello oh yes um so i this is a live broadcast currently i'm mostly encouraging people to leave the live broadcast and enter spatial chat itself but i'm kind of just popping around and visiting projects do you have a minute to tell us about your project marianne sure is the um the trailer playing in the background like distracting oh well i it's not distracting because i don't hear audio from it so it's okay to see it on the screen sure okay um so my project is called root it is a immersive film and also a vr installation looking at race and representation in 3d digital media um it follows a character named yara and she goes through the she does this like hair journey going through these magical hair worlds where she likes and starts off in a straight air force and ends up in a curly hair world and is transformed so that's basically my project awesome and what's the um i'm sorry to ask such a question where because i'm so like such a vr kind of beginner or i don't know beginners maybe even two too strong what is your um is it for a particular platform if somebody wanted to um watch the film or experience it is that something that they can do now or in the future if they want to learn more about it um in the future i'll post it on the project page um i'm going to be taking the summer to actually complete it right now i just have the trailer and the the world setup and some of the the performance capture um ideally it would be an inperson installation where we'd scream the film and then check out the vr piece but i'm definitely going to be working on a webbased version so once that's out i will share that awesome fantastic so if people want to i see this is so kind of amazing by the way i love the way your area is organized and that you filled the chairs with wonderful little emojis which is awesome but i i mean it's i guess i'm speaking the obvious here but um everyone should take a look here you can see um in this pink square over here there's the url for the project you can check out um instagram linkedin vimeo page and contact info if people would like to find out more about this really exciting and wonderful film and more about your work yeah thank you congratulations thank you have fun everybody thanks okay here i am oh actually i'm gonna i'm gonna move closer to your trailer because i realize when i move closer to it we can hear the audio so i'm gonna let it play oh yeah please let me know if you guys have any questions i have a little trouble navigating here oh my computer is like all of a sudden grinding to a halt here okay move over here um maybe i should mute myself in spatial chat for a moment so people don't hear me there we go i'm gonna bring myself back here okay so i am going to um move on to my sort of goal is to look at a couple projects on each page i'm gonna move to narrative and storytelling um and see if david is there for his a life's a boat project so here we go i'm clicking on narrative and storytelling oh just to reset the room again anybody's newly joined uh you don't need to be watching me i i appreciate it if you do that's wonderful maybe you maybe you prefer just being able to see somebody kind of wandering around through this show but i highly encourage you to just join yourself um you can just go right to this url in the browser and experience the different projects that are on display in different rooms and uh ask questions and enjoy yourself all right so let me move on to going to the narrative and storytelling uh page and acting with weird mute the spatial chat audio for all of you and let's see where am i i can't find myself what is going on where am i i can't i can't find myself in spatial chat i'm lost i don't exist uh let's see i must be somewhere i'm looking at all these projects my video is on let's see i'm gonna unmute myself i can't find myself is anybody near me to tell me where i am okay what room what project is this i found myself okay oh okay now i've uh hi uh so i'm a live broadcast i mean i'm a person i don't know why my computer has decided that it's just like all was working so well all of a sudden it's you can see my videos basically become incredibly choppy um but um i'm able to hear you and see you just fine so here i am in the project called it's raining could you introduce yourself and tell us about your project if you're okay with doing that yeah sure um welcome um my project call it's raining it's an interactive multistory line website about a rainy day it was first a digital translation of the real life art piece ring room um but then i got into building this site i add my impressions of rainy days i think they're secretive absurd and mysterious so i build interactions based on those impressions rather than going through a complete story um you will find yourself being in moments that will lead you to other certain moments according to your choice of past um yeah the link is above um feel feel free to visit the site or i can like like demonstrate it i have a screen share here oh let's try the live demo we haven't had a live demo yet i'd love to see how that works okay happy too it's my first time so so you can choose the man or you can choose that you have an umbrella i don't know if you have a preference but if you do please tell me oh it's too much too much of a decision for me i can't i can't handle it maybe um an umbrella then okay you have an umbrella on a rainy day and you're walking um and then there's a dog and a in a house do you want to choose or i can choose it for you no i i can now i can handle it let's go for the dog i'm a dog person nice well you're following the dog it's leading you to a pond and here's a countdown back to the opening scene amazing so i i it's like i i'm fascinated by your project but mostly i'm just like so thrilled to see so this is in the way that you're doing this in spatial chat is that you're you've added a screen share that just appears as like any other image or video and then we're able to see it that's amazing and so um if people want to try is try the project themselves um they can go the url is right there um you can sort of see i'm going to zoom in so people can see it shannon who dot github dot io slash final is that right did i pronounce your name correctly yes okay wonderful and did you what what um um what tools did you use to build this um html script css and javascript wonderful yeah great work thank you so much for sharing thank you for coming all right here we go i'm moving around i'm trying i'm seeing if david i see some people following me i know i know you're like um you were one of his close friends so yeah i know looks like we we got company yeah we do hello i'm sorry to interrupt i just want to let everybody know that i'm currently a live broadcast i mean you're live on the internet in some sense but uh uh you know so if anybody wants to run away you're welcome to do that but uh i i don't know i'm really sorry to interrupt but do you have a minute david to show your project sure so first of all i want to introduce you to nick who is outside of itp like i know him through an undergrad friend of mine oh awesome hi nick yeah so nice to meet you man yeah dan is one of my favorite professors you know so he's not a professor he's a professor [Laughter] i had him this semester yeah so back in college i had a thing with the professors it's like if you were like a really cool professor i would call you professor like you don't really you don't really get that title from me unless i i spill it upon you you know what i'm saying i see i don't know i feel like uh i don't know if i fit i mean i hopefully i'm like a nice and thoughtful and helpful person but i don't know you use the word cool there i don't know if i qualify for that that's for sure i don't know man i mean you seem pretty cool to me right off the bat yeah yes you should see his youtube videos like he has a whole youtube channel called the recording train yes we're live on it right now but i teach 3d in photoshop so i'm having a little bit of a 4d an issue where my like browser is just locking up so hold on i'm going to try resetting it and be right back okay uh technical difficulties everyone look at this do you want to see my project then i do but i'm a little worried it's not going to work because everything is frozen so i'm going to come right back page unresponsive okay so i don't know to what extent um obs this is what i i'm running open broadcast studio and i might oh headphone just disconnected um let me try getting back into spatial chat um and this is just the uh coding train discord let's see if everything is kind of going smoothly again all right this is going sorry everybody let's try opening up the browser again i feel like maybe i should quit obs i want to quit obs briefly see if that helps um i'm also going to do something that seems a little bit odd but i'm going to change where my plug is oh my battery is done wow i'm plugged in but like it has no charge why it's just like battery is not charging because it's just like the life is being sucked out of my computer sorry i realized i wasn't even on screen here so let's give this a second okay it's charging again oof that was kind of a disaster i've lowered the brightness doesn't lower for you let's see if i can get back to spatial chat all right let's take here i'm gonna take a short break here and i'm gonna quit chrome i'm gonna quit discord and i'm going to let the um right i'm going to see if my computer can kind of um just gather its strength i don't know what just happened but like the fan is going crazy the battery went to zero even though i'm plugged in which uh is a little bit distressing so i think maybe just somehow running obs and being in spatial chat and all of that really just um i need like an ice pack to put underneath the computer look at this nice seethrough little uh sticker here so i don't know if anybody has um any questions you want to ask right now i can put on some like uh waiting music here um oh the music's not gonna play because i have uh oh wait um i've disconnected oh no it is all right hold on everyone let's do the following i'm actually going to just completely shut down the computer and restart it so if you're just tuning in which i don't know that anybody is i am attempting to live stream the itp ima lores show um but my computer that i am uh for joining the show the online show from uh which is not the same computer that i'm live streaming from obviously because you can still hear and see me um really just i don't know what happened but it just decided to fall apart so i'm giving it a moment to rest a moment to breathe i could go to maybe i need a little break for myself could go to my little like intermission animation but mostly i'm just kind of talking here vamping so to speak um to like let the computer charge up a little bit and hopefully then kind of reboot it and be all set and fine um vicky asks in the chat why is there nature of code in the video unfortunately i've lost the threat of what that was referring to i've also just now in the last five minutes lost about 15 viewers i hope it's because you've all gone and joined the show yourself uh i'm gonna give let's let's let's take a proper uh i think this is too awkward for oh who built the spatial chat website i got a question i don't know the answer it is not something that i am affiliated with um it is a service that i believe you can use for free and sign up for but i have no personal knowledge or relationship to it whatsoever it just happens that the program chose to use it as a mechanism or means to display all the projects and ronald thank you for your nice message that's good because i'm am i feeling a little like uh hot and sweaty here um having some technical difficulties and just having to um talk silently in a room by myself with these lights i'm in an attic in brooklyn new york with a camera on me um i think how is the doggy ask here and oh thank you for asking so first of all if you don't know i was i have a gloria pickle is my dog she is a six i want me to get gloria up here hey gloria gloria we'll see if she comes usually she comes and sleeps right next to me if i'm working at this desk or streaming or teaching but gloria is a sixyearold corgi beagle mix she was uh rescued by a um an organization called muddy paws rescue muddy as in i like to jump in muddy puddles um they are based in brooklyn but they rescue dogs i think from kentucky and also perhaps alabama mightypawsrescue.org um and i've also been we've my family has been fostering with them so we had a dog a puppy an eightweekold puppy named marlon that was his name i was calling him martin so i got confused or marvin depending on how i felt um and we really loved uh having marlin here i have to admit i i wasn't the nicest but i was kind of complaining because having a puppy is a lot it was like a little bit too much for me but my family wonderfully took care of marlin i participated to the extent that i could but marlon was since adopted by a wonderful uh family and uh marlon's gonna have a wonderful life living in upstate new york at a campground so um many many happy returns from marlin i hope to be able to keep in touch the video was the video on the life's about in the spatial chat so the reason why is that particular video is uh david's project is from my class called nature of code so i'm gonna restart my computer you're gonna hear the lovely chime sound in a minute we're going to hope that everything gets i'm going to blow on it maybe just to cool it off a little bit i think this works this is scientifically known if you go to the apple support website and you talk to the geniuses at the genius bar they will tell you lift up your laptop and blow on it way to cool down a computer also get an ice pack just set it right on top of the ice pack i'm gonna log in now uh poor david is probably waiting for me i am uh rebooting my computer francello wants to know what are your plans for the summer i'm so glad you asked coding train is my plan for summer may is a little bit wonky june is a little bit i'm not so sure july and august i hack i have some plans to be set up in a new studio with a standing desk to be getting back to my roots doing some more coding challenges we'll see if that happens uh but that's that's my plans um you know hopefully i'll have some time to just enjoy with family enjoy being outside um catching up ah the nature of code project i'm working on in collaboration with some folks a brand new coding train website um jiraj asks is the new nature of code playlist completely up now no no not even close in fact all of chapter five has yet to be released it's all been recorded and mostly edited so stay tuned for that i think i probably said this a month ago in the next couple weeks but really it's coming let's see how my uh how the laptop is doing um show percentage i'm at eight percent but as long as it's charging no apps using significant energy so that's a that's good um um and now i'm sorry i'm kind of answering questions and talking and trying to operate my computer at the same time i can show you what i'm doing so i'm i want to go and open up obs um i'm opening up open broadcast studio which should have my camera by the way this is a green screen which i just keyed it to black which is sort of silly with my live broadcast sign uh using significant energy i don't like that stop using significant energy um i need that energy let's go to tools and start virtual camera now we're going to go back into spatial chat coding train live broadcast i'm a live broadcast all that stuff got it continue uh uh no i want to be my my uh headphones disconnected they are now connected so i should be able to go to come on do i need to re let's refresh and see if the mic shows up there we go i am back into these headphones um yeah it's a little bit silly the whole reason i'm using obs is for this you know i wonder if turning off the keying the chroma keying is probably using a lot of resources so let's turn that off let's just delete it so hopefully that will help and now i just have a green background which is fine so we'll go back into here i'm going to join the space i also need to have loopback audio going um all right here i am i don't know if anybody can hear me i'm going to mute myself in spatial chat and i'm going to mute the spatial chat audio to the live stream uh everyone i'm just here in a welcome room trying to set up a live stream so you're you're welcome to participate and talk or come near me or run away just letting you know that's what's happening um ah great i had a little technical disaster hold on i'm going to send the audio here around the help uh basically if you want to visit any of the rooms there's a list of rooms on the right if you click any of them it'll take you there everything here is spatial yeah uh so if you if i move away from you you won't hear me anymore uh yeah and all the directory room has a map if you want to find out more about any of the projects being shown all right everybody got that explanation uh we're going to go back to narrative and storytelling we're going to try to find david i'm saying online they're just doing something maybe i'll check it out sounds good congratulations david this is this is really great oh thank you so much to louisa oh you're shiffman i'm back yeah so i discovered just in case anyone's wondering i for some reason my um computer plugged in the battery went all the way to zero percent running obs and spacer chat and everything oh my god so i shut it down i lifted it up i blew on it for a while to cool it off which i think is a scientifically proven method and uh i got it to ten percent and it seems to be going okay right now so i'm ready jay we're sorry for keeping you waiting we're i'm ready for uh for this audience that i've got on youtube who by the way should just join spatial chat and come right here in spatial chat itself but uh uh could you introduce yourself and tell us about your project okay so my name is david and i'm a first year itp student i just finished my first year i'm located in queens new york in flushing and like this is a final project i created for the nature of code is the nature of code class it's like a combination my life story my covet life story experience through p5.js and arduino physical computing so this is a video right here and i can i just use the potentiometers to adjust the weather of the ocean scene as seen in this video and i think it came out pretty good and like it's it shows like my personal life story and just explaining to it releasing my stress through the potentiometer you know so it's it's i made this project also metaphorical for both sending to life you know and standing through a storm and through good times and bad times you know so that's it wonderful yeah one of my favorite things about your project david is so you just have some beautiful quotes in there i don't want to spoil them i'll let people experiencing them for themselves but you really have some just delightful quotes and i just think it's also just tremendous work i know how challenging it can be to build your own interface and have it communicate with the browser and the way that you pick the different parameters with some of these algorithmic systems that we looked at in class and were able to develop your own interface for them and tie it into such a personal story is really just terrific wonderful work so um i i think i i'm not i think if i move my um self closer to the video i can hear your audio so i'm gonna do that and let people listen but um if people wanted to watch um use the sketch or watch this particular video themselves i'm assuming these two links that i see right here yes so that's it the first link is a documentation for my former project the second link is a nonpecan version of the sketch so that people can interact with it with the sliders which i replace with the potentiometers for this video or should i say right yeah we talked about that it's such a great thing to do if you work on an interactive p5.js sketch that's like got custom physical installation and hardware um you can have both you can maintain a simultaneous version that works with just browserbased interaction so people can actually experience that interaction themselves and then watch your video documentation to understand um how the hardware and the um gesture based physical interface works so it'd be uh it's too bad this is like such a perfect project for the live itp show i hope that next year and we're back together on the floor sometime you'll be able to bring it in so other other folks can can try it themselves yeah i really want to friendship breakups so i'm gonna i'm i'm kind of like listening in the in the back of my mind here or like just the corner of my ear i don't know what the right expression is for when the video starts but i think it's nearing the end is that right it is yeah yeah so i'm going to try to move myself up and so that we can so i can play it for the stream when it starts over okay perfect better now congratulations david i'm going to go and look around oh thank you so nice to meet you yeah nice to meet you nice to meet you too bye take care looking forward to a much better year and not stormy days anymore all right just i'm moving over here just to reset the room for a minute for anybody who's watching me live this is a oh uh live broadcast of an end of semester show from the itp ima and low res programs at tisch school of the arts nyu and i think the pro i think the video is about to start over is that right yes perfect i'm gonna move up and kind of zoom in on it thank you david when you go towards one side of the life bad things happen to you you go to a dark miserable storm and everything seems very pessimistic you go through happy days and things go very good for you people love you everything goes the way you wanted to and in between you have ups and downs just like any other person does so 2020 was one hell of a year for me i've been through so much throughout the covet pandemic and a lot of people like i know like got the virus and it's been a crazy tough year you know so when the pandemic started my family and i got very sick with covet and we've been to these dark times my mother almost died and my father got very sick i was the most healthiest one during the pandemic and things were very dark for me and just just knowing that wanting for better days to come was just like a far away thing you know but then the pandemic got better my family and i tested negative for coving like things were looking up but it still wasn't the same there were still dark and stormy days i gained the quarantine 15 or should i say quarantine 50 pounds which was a whole lot for me aside from the weight already gained in the past my ticks social god works for my tourette's syndrome because i have tourette's syndrome which is a neurological disorder characterized by inflammatory movements and ticks and these were like horrible days for me like it's just tough to remember it you know so these were the stormy days and suddenly things were kind of rough here and there i also broke up with a lot of friends sorry had some friendship breakups and this thing's happening to me you know like a lot of changes in my life but then the better days were coming in 2021 now this year is looking up for me and there's no more storm things are starting to get better now although things are do have its ups and downs still but it's getting better now looking forward to a much better year and not stormy days anymore what a good way to release myself so far just to the turn of a potentiometer knob and one more thing i have to say light's a boat okay not too bad life is like a potentiometer when you go towards one side of the life bad things happen thanks for broadcasting yeah thanks for broadcasting of course all right i'm gonna wander around and head to some other projects take care it's kind of here i am uh really incredible for me to think that it's been a little over 20 years actually if we're talking about the full itp journey my itp journey has been uh rather long i saw myself on the in the video and i had to come over here reload on her screens um can you i'm i'm in the middle i'm kind of like wandering around the show and live broadcasting some of the projects can you give a quick um uh summary of uh just introduce yourself and tell us a few sentences about what it is that you worked on sure yeah so i'm akshita and i'm a first year itp student and my project was a hundred days of journalism for a class called hundred days of making and for the last 100 days i've been interviewing everyone from itp student faculties and staff members and hopefully this project is going to go on in summer and fall as well up to now i've done about 65 interviews and this uh is a compilation of the bits of the first question that i asked in the interview like which is on the screen and if you see the link on the left is the instagram page of uh where i post individual interviews as well amazing i i'm really just always so impressed and in awe of the hundred days projects that i've been following many of them and it's something that i have never tried to do and i certainly aspire to do it especially in the sort of creative coding world there's a lot of people who will do things like daily sketching and i think you know in in the sort of coding sketching sense and i think it's a wonderful practice to adopt to sort of uh you know release yourself in a way of like oh i have to spend like weeks or months or like get everything perfect no just but uh this is such a different kind of project with the with the journalism i imagine it was a tremendous amount of work just to like coordinate how did you manage that so i i think i i sent out google forms for the students and they filled out the google forms and that's how i got to know about their available days and times and for faculty i sent you all emails personally uh to better match um the timings i think the most challenging part was the postproduction because uh that took a lot of time honestly especially for the interviews that i took in person on the floor that was literally hard yeah yeah see wonderful well thank you for sharing this so if folks want to um catch all of the interviews they can it's the best places to send them to your instagram page yeah wonderful yeah i'm gonna zoom in on it and show show show everyone all right thanks so much for sharing thank you so much for coming by so here uh i'm gonna mute myself in spatial chat for a second um so here uh i'm gonna bring myself back here uh so here i would encourage you to check out the 100 days of journalism project by akshita and uh you can find her instagram link right there at instagram.com 100 days of journalism okay uh how's everybody doing in the chat people are still here are you you should go too have we hit well how many people are in the actual itp ima spatial chat show can we get it up to 500 people that's my personal goal help me out here share this let's get 500 people into it we could do it um i'm gonna wander through i have a kind of list of projects oh where am i um moving around here layton vignettes let's go check that out yeah yep yep that was right i see mr shipman i think uh i haven't figured out it is hi i have arrived hello i should warn everyone that this is you're being you're being sort of like transmitted across the intertubes right now although mostly i just so used to tom ran away um i heard that and he was like i don't know why that's why i've done this that's the proper that is the only appropriate reaction by the way to uh um so here i am i'm i'm sorry i have like a million buttons to press before i can uh to orient myself let me press this um hi kevin how are you hi i'm great how are you um um i would love for you to uh if you have a minute and don't mind being uh broadcast here to tell us a little bit about this project sure um this is a virtual production short made entirely in unreal engine 4. so um at least at itp there's two kind of like prevailing schools of thoughts or kind of use cases of unreal engine one is uh in game play so using like blueprints or a c plus and kind of like programming environment where the user can go through yourself or um in you know hollywood and the mandalorian i'm sure a lot of people have seen is using unreal engine sequencer um to produce uh you know timebased media uh media production so it's more kind of like a 3d after effects premiere pro type of situation so this is the latter um this is using that and kind of like recording out a bunch of unreal uh sorry uh realtime uh sequences and then uh tied together with match cuts so you know the eyeopening into the subway tunnel the falling versus the rising um the connected with light and then the life and death wow so just to unpack this for a moment um i definitely understand the distinction between using something like unreal engine for an interactive experience a game that somebody might play or for i'm a huge fan of like the mandalorian specifically but just kind of shows that are using a lot of um exciting new techniques and virtual production visual effects but one thing that's never is not entirely clear to me is um the the what's what's actually um you know what's real time versus rendered so for example is the benefit of a lot of what you're doing here is that there isn't that distinction like if you design a scene uh you don't need to like press the render button and wait overnight to see the footage but it actually just happens real time and is there like sort of a uh a quality tradeoff there um that's that's one i don't i don't have it's kind of a i'm kind of bouncing around this question without a very well formed thought but that's kind of uh that distinction between real time versus render how does that play a role in your work uh yes um that i think you pretty much got it it's a it's a definitive time tradeoff and in you know like media production time is money yeah and also for rendering essentially you know like really good animation studios like pixar dreamworks like they have essentially large render farms like large server rooms just blasting uh like gpu cards at it and real time just you know relies on your local like gpu whatever you have there is a quality tradeoff but not much i think that that's the appeal of unreal is right now it's getting to a place where it's much better um and it depends on kind of like what you're using it for maybe it's not you know to the level that people want for pixar like you know like um feature length movies sort of like quality um and a lot of the tools uh that unreal has is getting better and better partially because it's owned by epic games and epic has fortnite so they're able to just buy everyone um the same strategy that apple use essentially you know you have the money you buy all the startups and you get all the tech and you make it free to a certain extent um so it's getting popular more and more popular and then you know thanks to shows like the mandalorian which uh the virtual production there is essentially i don't know if you've seen the behind the scenes yeah the led yeah um it's the time right like you're getting you're able to get posts and vfx into the same room as principal photography or the dp and the director so there's no lag there's no latency between the two and you're able to visualize things on the fly so you don't have to like go back and see oh this didn't come out right let me reshoot it right yeah i was i was watching an interview i think it was with one of the sort of like lighting designer or lighting animators and i i mean by like virtual lighting and they were so excited to work on the mandalorian and the i'm paraphrasing whatever the interview was but it was the first experience where they were actually there on set like doing their work as opposed to it all being sort of after the fact in a different room like by themselves so that was really cool to see i would love um i think it would be really exciting to have a kind of at you know tisch at itp ima to have a kind of mini or virtual volume type set that people could play with and so what um if um like for me like i you know have a lot of experience with certain kinds of digital media and coding and different kinds of graphics but i haven't worked with these kinds of 3d engines what what would be for somebody who's coming from a creative coding world perhaps if they wanted to get into unreal like what what are the what's the starting point what are the skills or or kind of prerequisites in a way before getting started with this kind of work um i would say in my opinion uh most of the creative coding people actually prefer unity a little bit more than on just based on you know you can just get into csharp and and modify things uh with code which to me i'm coming from a uh actually like a filmmaking and data science background um so unreal's ui felt much more intuitive and a lot of this sort of controls that we're dealing with right now um is essentially mimicking reallife filmmaking and that's the kind of like um the onramp for um you know professional filmmakers to get onto unreal or that's the hope um so uh examples of this are you know the way that the camera glides there's like a virtual crane there's a virtual dolly um you know you can put like lens flares and you can put like different like sort of like dirt maps on there and you can change the focal length and the the um sensor with even though there's no sensor no um but i would say you know uh understand kind of what you're using on real four um it's interesting because it's a game engine but you don't have to use it for games right you're essentially in the realtimeness of it um and the 3dness of it and uh there's a lot of applications to be done there and uh one of the things actually if you uh went to the pcomp room i have another project i did with a collaborator at itp um where we created a physical computing uh camera without any image detection and we would essentially instead have a bunch of environmental sensors and you can grab kind of like snapshots of um the light condition and send it to a server and in unreal i can hook onto that server through http get request and then use that data to drive the lighting condition uh change in the scene awesome wow that's cool i've actually i'm hoping to head by i i'm like i was like oh i'm gonna hit all the rooms and somehow i think i'm only on my third so but um that's awesome to hear and and for anybody who's tuning in like obviously you can just join this spatial chat uh system yourself just by going to the url that's pinned in the video description and in the chat so check out both this project and the other one uh in the pcomp room as well so cool thanks so much for sharing this um it's awesome i'm excited to see where it all leads thank you thank you awesome thanks okay let me head to uh empty welcome room all right i'm in an empty welcome room woof here i am right i'm back in my seat this is my really highend visual effects i've integrated myself perfectly into this room of watching the show here how's everybody doing there's a few of you still tuning in um ronald is saying that's crazy i never thought about unreal as an animating engine yeah i i don't know like maybe i feel like i was gonna say it's too late for me which is the wrong way to put it but um i i i'm just fascinated by what's happening in animation and virtual production it's it's not really a skill set or that i have um but it's kind of amazing to see um what different students and and creative folks are doing these days and maybe maybe in some small way i can align some ideas or you know i was thinking of learning actually unity or blender um in particular and trying to do some to work with those on the coding train but okay let's move on um i'm running i'm kind of running a a little bit low on steam here i was going to try to go until 9 30 p.m which is very late way past my bedtime it's way past my bedtime let's play this 19 music here oh boy people are hearing me i remember i should mute myself with spacious chat i came here because it was empty uh but uh ah maybe this is a viewer here um you're hearing me probably in both ears now and sort of like with a weird echo delay but i'm going to head over to physical computing and product design and i have my eye and a couple projects um there that i want to check out so oh there's a lot of people in that room i wonder if i should go somewhere that's a little less crowded all right we'll turn this music off um all right so i'm heading over to product design pcomp here we go and i meant to check my only mute myself here bring myself oh i am back i'm gonna i'm gonna just check how's my oh good okay we seem to be the computer seems to be charging again uh which is a very good sign okay so let's find um let me zoom out here let me take myself out there and let's see ah um where did i go where did i end up i'm lost again i zoomed out and i can't find myself is great how did that happen where am i i have to unmute myself oh no i'm down here okay you don't lose it's not as if you need too many they seem to be in the middle of a conversation so let's go uh all right here we are ah okay hold on hello aiden hello how's it going it's going well um i am sorry i'm kind of getting my ducks in a row the wires plugged into the right thing i'm making sure my audio stuff is going so this is by the way it's a live broadcast if you can tell by the uh overlay i got going here um do you have a minute to share um share about your work and project yeah absolutely i'd love to awesome uh take it away whenever you're ready i've got all right plugged in and working sounds great hello everybody um this is my project called infinite reflections and it is the first video infinity mirrors what you're looking at right up here is a reallife video sculpture containing 14 000 leds it is not a render um if you want to scan the hash uh yeah this qr code you can see the videos in hd i'm also going to play them here but we'll see what happens um so just to go over the basics of an infinity mirror you've got a light source in between a regular mirror and a beam splitter so the light bounces back and forth some of it escapes each time and you see uh repetition into the z axis um so last semester so hyland knows that and i created the first video infinity mirror which you can see here um and this is what it looks like in my apartment it is about two feet wide and that's what it looks like when i can start um this semester i kept on going and i created a sphere mirror and convex mirror these are the same inside modular ring but there's different back and front plates so in this case on the left there's speeder mirror which is based on yay kusama's work it's hemispheres on a back mirror that are reflected into spheres and then repeated into the zaxis on the right i'm using a convex smear so that's kind of what you might see at a convenience store to see around the corner it's a bulging lens and that causes the visuals to warp warp inwards um i'll just play this for a couple seconds so we can see um maybe fast forward to here um yeah so if you look closely on any of the individual spheres i don't know if this is glitching out or not but you can actually see all the other spheres floating in space there and the visuals you see happenstance turn out to be exactly what is visible in the same animations on the convex mirror because a hemisphere is a convex mirror as well um so a lot of my work this semester was learning how to use touch designer so that i could create different types of particle simulations and graphics that take advantage of this circular um screen that i built with these mirroring properties so if you move the graphics up and down through the screen it creates a tunnel if you flip them on your side and move them back and forth through the screen it creates this spiraling tunnel effect the next one is the result of moving the visuals one direction through the screen and reflecting the subsequent repetitions um and up until this point i've been using all these mirroring tricks to get rid of the scene that's in the middle because i'm setting a rectangular video to a circular screen um the next one is the first example i've been able to figure out so far of getting rid of the seam and not using any tricks i'm actually programmed in the rules in the asteroids game so the stripes are flying out one side of the screen and then they come in through the other at the same angle both on the top and the bottom uh eventually i'll be rendering in a 3d environment and then mapping it to a cylinder but i haven't gotten that part yet um here's a overview of how everything works but the important things are that there's an app you can control on your phone and you can send live graphics to it over wifi so i built a server that's running on my raspberry pi that takes udp messages that i'm sending from my desktop that can basically pull in any siphon stream from any program in a processing sketch and what that allows me to do is create a realtime interactive sculpture so this is called panopti's mirror and it's based on the panopti's uh myth of the hundredeyed beast that was rewarded for his service for um by having his eyes put on the peacock feathers so this version of the mirror um is the commentary on surveillance capitalism and the ease at which we give our biometric data and privacy information away for a little bit of entertainment so go back to the beginning it attracts you over to these flashy peacock visuals and when you step in front of it it's using open cv eye tracking the camera grabs your eyes they do a realtime mask send them through touch designer and then out over wifi to project in real time into the mirror your reward for giving up your eyes is to have your eyes staring back at you so the eyes get switched over from the peacock feathers into this particle simulation um and it gets a little bit overwhelming sometimes and then when you step away uh knows you're no longer in front of it and transitions back into peacock feathers um out of rest a lot of stuff there yeah wow that was uh you must have explained this project before i think you seem to have that totally down um practice a little bit it was my thesis yeah no i don't but so um so this is amazing and people are uh you probably don't see the youtube chat there's a small audience here and people are saying all sorts of nice things including how could i buy this was one of the comments so um actually so that's my first question on instagram yeah first question to you which isn't how can i buy this but uh are the is this just currently in your own space have you installed it anywhere else do you have plans to because to me i i kind of i really have a sense of what it is and i can kind of you know use my mind to sort of like try to imagine uh i mean it's absolutely beautiful seeing the documentation of it you've done a really excellent job uh taking video and and imagery of it that i get a good sense of it but i i can't help but think nothing there's no real replacement for being there with it um so is um and i know obviously there's a lot of you know challenges and restrictions in terms of being able to show work um in the last year and um but as things are now changing and opening up um this is something that do you have plans of where you might install this or uh when can i see it in person that's really my question you can see it tomorrow because it's at the itp floor right now oh it is i put it up in the hallways yeah so it'd be great if you go there at night when it's dark so you don't get the white washing you out behind you um but yeah so it's gonna be at itp for a few weeks um i definitely would love to exhibit it anywhere i could get the opportunity to in the future um and yeah i'm kind of exploring this idea kind of just brush the surface of it but this this idea that you can have a physical sculpture that many people have um but the physical sculptures can have customized digital content on them um this future marketplace of you know all these digital assets that are becoming collectibles i think this could be a great um actual use case instead of just fake uh spinning gifts spinning dollar signs i um i own um a couple one piece that's like from a company called infinite objects which is like um they make it's called you know printable video and so there you know obviously you have a much more highly specialized unique like you know uh display i mean their uh infinite object stuff is is amazing but it's more traditional rectangular video as opposed to this like incredible uh spherical display but yes i think you know to me i love having that and um you know i i can see that that's there's a lot of potential there in thinking about how um how people could you know share their artworks and visuals on this over a network uh um and and that sort of thing um one thing just to quickly add it's so funny like i was uh i was watching a twitch stream about shaders the other day and they were basically making all these radial patterns it's amazing how similar they look but also the discussion i was kind of chiming in on the chat there was about dealing with the seam so it depends a lot on what you're doing but um you know there's a lot of tricks in computer graphics in terms of looking at polar coordinates and saying and like um and um being able to you know people are doing this often with like gif loops and using uh purlin noise or simplex noise these different like noise algorithms to be able to sort of like walk through the numbers in a in a radial space to then tie one end to the other so i'm sure you've explored and thought about some of this stuff but to the extent um that's definitely something that comes up a lot in my own sort of teaching and examples and if there's anything that i can help with there definitely let me know this is it it does like to be used for coding trains that i would love it's a small detail but it's it it can make as i'm sure you've discovered like a huge uh difference it's gonna like take you out of the the sort of absolutely the illusion of what you're experiencing once you see that like ah it's a it's a screen because there's this weird line there so um yeah it's a wonderful amazing work i can't i'm so excited to hear what what is today tuesday yes i'll be on the floor tomorrow not at night but i'll try to be able to be cloudy at some point i can take a look at it take a big poster board and hold it behind your back yeah that's awesome and so if people want to find out more about this the qr code and your website are the best place to send them yeah yep or instagram too yeah it's not updated great awesome thank you so much for sharing thanks so much for stopping by now all right okay i have muted myself i'm coming back here how's everybody doing um i see we have a coding train member adriel oliveira that i um i don't know if you're still watching uh i think you must be newish um if you're a new coding trained member um make sure you check um that find the google form that's like linkedin where you sign up um so that we can be in touch and get you uh onboarded into the discord and all that stuff um let's see um let's let me zoom out here uh oh brandon looks like let me go see i wanted to check out the solar fractal so um i'm listening there's a little bit of a conversation going on that i don't want to interrupt um but um um but uh i'll wait as they wind down and maybe we'll we'll see if brandon can give us a nice explanation of this project yes hi sorry i oh now i i have just unmuted your audio i have a i i i'm getting a little better at my system here this is a live broadcast uh uh it's the the appropriate reaction by the way is to run away go somewhere else if you want um but i'm kind of wandering around here and um checking out some of the projects um this is one that i know well because it just happens to be from a class that i'm involved with i guess is a weird way to put it um so do you have a minute brandon to to give us a quick um to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about this project yeah of course so uh yeah i'm i'm brandon uh i was fortunate to be in the nature of code with dan this semester and uh this project is a solarpowered fractal tree so it's uh you know combining what i was learning in the nature of code with fractal trees and l systems um with an enclosure that's uh an epaper display that's being run by an arduino so i had to port a bunch of what we were learning in in class to the arduino ide and uh then it's solarpowered so like a a real plant when it's exposed to light uh that'll generate new growth over time amazing and and this is um i have not yet experienced this in person but this is um you have this there's just one of these right now and you have it uh at home with you or do you have plans for thinking about how you might get yeah oh there it is just the one yeah i'd love to figure out how to simplify it a bit um i had a good chat a moment ago with allison parrish and she was pointing out how um yeah like the minimalist aesthetic i think there's some ways right now there's a lipo battery in it that's not necessarily good for the environment i think the whole thing could be trimmed down to maybe run on a capacitor maybe even lower power so yeah there's i want to do a little tweaking to the hardware but uh yeah certainly uh yeah i'd love to make more of these i think uh you know we were of course talking about mutation in class and in my mind uh some next steps for this would be to have the growth continue for the plant so once it kind of reaches an adult stage it could develop seeds and those seeds could have some random mutations to the rules from the l system uh into the next generation so like over time it could evolve so um yeah it's really interesting to see that we i was just looking at um aiden's project and you know on the one hand you think these are completely unrelated different projects this infinity mirror and this you know small epaper display but they both i think get at something to me that's really exciting about this kind of work which is you know especially in the last year we're all experiencing so much of you know graphics and chat and text and everything through our rectangular traditional very bright computer screens hunched over them and so there's something i think aiden's the infinity mirror is is you know is is very uh like explosive and exciting and dynamic and uh and red bloods but this has this sort of very like quiet and contemplative quality to it but yet it's the same algorithms and kind of graphical systems that i know from that i would see in a p5 sketch so i think there's um there's i think there's some something really lovely about that and i agree i think you know my like my family's super into animal crossing which is so much like gardening and plants and stuff like that but i i love this idea of being able to if i had one to have my own you know little l system plant that i could tend to and care to and share with others and what does it mean that how is mine the same or different than yours and i think there's a lot of potential and possibilities there um and i and i and i love you know what yeah the idea that this is um you know solar powered um it has a kind of handmade uh quality to it that i think you know all those pieces like really work together conceptually as um within in one project which is great yeah thank you so much dan i love those thoughts and i think uh slowing down is something i've been thinking a lot about um and there there are other projects too like i i never show the other wall of my room because the zoom is always facing this way but um yeah there's uh this year moon day clock that i've been infatuated with um that similarly like makes you think about time on a different scale yeah and uh yeah i love i love that this project too can be yeah using so many new technologies but still um kind of make me slow down and and think about time on a different scale yeah wonderful awesome and so if people want to find out more and hopefully you know sign up for your eventual um crowdfunding uh campaign to produce millions of these um where should where should they go i guess the link's right here is the page yeah yeah so my name brandonroots.com i mean i'll post links there eventually uh or you can follow me on instagram be roots but yeah there's a link here for uh the blog posts showing up awesome thank you so much for sharing great work congratulations thank you dan yeah it's great seeing you thank you okay i'm moving along here let me i muted myself i'm gonna go to a welcome room here okay here i am ah the quiet space of the welcome room oh we got the coding train live broadcast with us again yeah but the welcome room is my place to go and like take a beat take a breath oh i pressed the wrong button uh like but because at one point i think it changed like there was a point where the welcome room was everybody was muted with camera off and i was like [Laughter] by the way coding trade audience you are looking at the uh i don't know what the producers organizers the heroes of the itp ima lowrise spring show matt and ellen how is this experience this is like we're flipping the script back you're interviewing me on lip tv now i'm interviewing you been a guest on uh great um no it's been really nice we've had so many amazing people just kind of show up that i hadn't met before um maybe some of you from coding train are coming and joining us and it's just been really nice to meet some new folks and uh yeah we've been talking to students and they're saying that they got some great conversations happening people kind of showing up and chatting and um i don't know ellen and i were just shooting for fun chaos yeah uh not everything crashing and breaking crap chaos so i think so far we're succeeding with uh yeah it's great uh you know this the way you've organized the spatial chat stuff is working super well um and and people in the um just informally in like the youtube chat have been really like everyone's like what's spatial chat who made spatial chat this looks so cool so i think uh we're doing something for the spatial chat company should hopefully give us a discount next year with all the promotions [Laughter] sorry ellen i think i was interrupting you you're about to say something oh just that we have one more hour of the show left so if folks want to want to come join and hang out um we'd we'd love to have you for the next hour yeah and i'm i'm i'm winding down i haven't made it to every room yet i'm going to try to do a couple more but i'm winding down soon so definitely if you're watching this the real experience is the spatial chat url that is in the description as well as pin to the chat so don't don't watch this banter this like exciting banter between very tired after a long semester employees of new york university you got to get into the real thing and get feed off the energy and creativity of all the students in their projects all right i'm going to wander off to the corner to reset the room a bit and figure out where i'm going next so i'll let you get back to your okay welcoming of people okay how we doing everybody i'm muting myself i'm just going off into the corner people are following me oh this is exhausting um there's a few of you still watching i'm um i'm getting seeing some comments here and there in the chat i'm looking at my list of projects um let's see oh i meant to get the live poll going what's the chance oh no this is a terrible idea i have this live poll system that i'm working on to put an overlay on my live streams where people can vote on things and i meant to actually test that out because i i i did it on a recent live stream and had all sorts of issues and thanks to um different viewers who have been contributing a bunch of those issues have been ironed out and i meant to i was thinking oh i could like have people vote but if you're in the chat well i think as i say love wonderful name love um has asked a question how long have you been a professor for well the first class that i taught um formally uh was paid to teach at a university so i guess that's the measurement was in 2004. um at that time i taught as an adjunct um and then a few years later i had a fulltime teaching position um and i've had various iterations of that over the years but i have now been associated with this program this department at nyu for um a little over 20 years now or 20 years exactly because i started in 2001. um all right so that answered that question um let's see so i would like to if you're in the chat there is play games education which i'm really keen on going to that's probably my next stop machine learning perform performance grab bag and installation slash ar so let me know in the chat if you have you can see the rooms here if you have a preference as to where i should go but i think i'm probably going ahead to play games animation there's a project there that i think is of great interest to coding trained viewers called b5 you might recognize b5 yes i'm saying b as in uh bagel not uh uh uh uh pea as in processing uh but maybe that'll be my last stop because honestly like i haven't it's 9 40 at night it was been a very busy day i kind of only had a bit of like a snack for dinner and i'm really starting to feel that pain right now um so i think i want to like allow myself to go to one more room and then kind of wrap up for the night how's everybody how's everybody okay with that so let's head over to play games education here we go and where am i i never know where i am when i drop into a page here people i'm gonna mute them where where am i is this me no here i am that's me oh i'm in b5 that's where i was going uh hold on a sec uh hello uh this is a live broadcast as i uh i see people running for the hills which again is the appropriate reaction uh but you're welcome to stay um so i'm i'm wandering around i'm on the tail end here i've been seeing a lot of projects and my my mind is turning a little bit to mush but i know that this particular project would be of great interest to coding trained viewers with the connection to creative coding uh you can see sort of b5 and how uh as an upside down p looks like uh there p5 um paling i wonder if you could take if you if you have some time to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about this project uh yeah sure so i'm a graduating ima student and also incoming itp student um so this is my capstone project for ima and it's called b5 and it's like a visual programming language for creative coding so visual programming language is basically people use like wires and box instead of lines of code to to make programs um and b5 particularly and focused on creative coding so uh it's like a visual version of p5 and and i hope it's more intuitive and more playful and easier to learn than p5 and yeah so people can kind of get get their hands on it more easily and use it for like learning and fast prototyping and with when they want to learn like creative coding amazing i thought i thought i was muted i'm like looking for my unmute button but i think you can hear me um wonderful uh super exciting to see um so i guess i have a couple questions one is um you know my you know there's a lot of parallels here obviously it's a very different project as well but parallels to things something like scratch which is block based as well as other like data flow environments like max msp jitter scratch being more geared to younger audiences max msp jitter being to sort of you know i don't know if this is accurate to say but uh you know sort of like audio audio video uh advanced users maybe um is there um if you see that the audience for what you're building here is um intersects with p5 users but is it about a different age group or a different way of thinking like how do you differentiate that in your mind what's the i guess if i were to i'm like rambling i can't ask a question in one sentence i really need to like work on that but my question is who is your desired audience for this yeah yeah yeah so so you mentioned scratch and also like more advanced tools like max mxp and so so to me b5 is more like a midpoint uh of those two kinds of projects so uh products so so like in terms of design um it's kind of like a mix of nodebased and blockbased visual programming languages so so scratch is like a blog based so it's it's like you there's still like lines of code but they're like wrapped in blocks and you play with the blocks and for max it's like node base so to kind of connect the blocks with your with your wires and b5 is kind of like a mix of them so it's node based so you still have like separate blocks but also the location of the blocks still matters so so when you place a block like kind of like uh before another block uh their execution order will change so so so this is a particular design that is very special to b5 so you can kind of play with your code or like tweaks a little bit and to to have a like totally different like an effect and also um in terms of like the target users as you mentioned so scratches for like kids or like people who have no experience in programming and like there's definitely a lot of like very advanced or powerful visual programming languages and b5 is uh kind of also like in between so we want to so so i i try to make it like as simple and user friendly as possible follows i i'm trying to kind of give it some power so it can be used for like serious production and also for like a lot of uh you know creative coding projects and also for fast prototyping yeah and that's been the spirit i think of uh of you know the processing project certainly since the beginning it's very challenging to kind of like balance all these different tradeoffs of different audiences but having a tool that is both something that people can get started with very quickly and easily and kind of see results immediately on their sort of first day or first five minutes even as well as that has depth to it and allows you to sort of build larger more involved projects um it's really uh is is really a wonderful sweet spot for these kind of creative coding tools and frameworks so it's great to see that you're kind of exploring exploring that um through this project so i see that you it's you know here on the you know i guess it's to the the right of me left me who knows what direction that is or everything's mirrored and backwards but there's the people can actually just go ahead and try it right now um um and are there what's what are your kind of like next steps for the project i know when we've talked about this before like we've talked about like sort of user testing and like you know sort of longer term roadmap for the project where are you kind of in the journey of it and what sort of like how can people who might be watching like help help out or get involved yeah so uh so first thing for for me of course is continue debugging it so although it's like live right now it's still very buggy and your pro so so it's very not recommended for for alexa's production right now using it and so i'll definitely add more like some basic features to it and also for people who who are interested in this project and also want to contribute uh the best way is probably to design a blog for yourself so you can find like how to design blocking the redmi file in the github repo and it's actually very easy to to kind of design a block and just like push it to the ripple and i guess that's uh the most meaningful or like the most wonky way for for for contributors to contribute to this project right now so designing a block would be something like if um like this might already be implemented but like if they're if purlin noise wasn't available as a block that um i could contribute sort of like code in presumably javascript to write the code for that block you know yeah embed the perlin noise algorithm into it and then that would become part of b5 that people could get have inputs and outputs from that block is that the idea right right yes yes yes and so you can define like the the style of the block the the input output nodes what are they and their descriptions and yeah so so i have a like kind of like a template for that and you can just like put putting those information if i render block for you wonderful awesome cool that's very exciting uh great work it's super exciting to to see and if um i guess if people um have questions or they find issues with it posting in the sort of issues on the github page is that the best place for feedback and questions uh yes definitely awesome all right so everyone please check out and give a b5 editor.app a try um and you can join you can check out the github repo and more info about paling's work at his website there thanks so much for sharing this with us thank you thank you okay i just heard you this is my new technique when i need to like sort of have a momentary break here is just turn off my camera and mute my microphone all right so let's have let me zoom out here and see what we can see um hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy inner oracle itp sandbox and soul train machine says i'll be right back i was kind of wanted to see this allterrain machine but it says i'll be right back so i think we have to wait um i'm looking for oh sub to vizio let's um i think this is i'm trying to hit some low res projects so that's also uh let's see if we can wander over here let me let me turn my camera back on um and mute myself and let's see if i can zoom in hello uh i'm a a live broadcast visitor is this is this project open for business okay hi adam nice to see you um so for anybody who's just kind of oops let me remove myself in this way um who is um a wandering nearby i'm a simul casting this uh spatial chat room to uh to youtube wandering through various projects and uh adam here has graciously just spontaneously agreed to to share his work so if uh could you would if you have a minute to introduce yourself and talk about a subdivisio exclamation point i'd love to hear about it it's starting to there's a little bit you can vary just at this point um and if i subdivide it again then it's taking oops each of those sorry i'm i've done a horrible thing which is that i had an audio glitch the last couple of minutes and so you're on oh it wasn't going through i hate to make you start all the way over um but i have that fixed now if you want to you're welcome to con to but yeah no uh but but yeah so sorry about that i wonder if you could just kind of circle back to the beginning of what you were uh uh explaining for the project sure take it uh go all the way back to the top or just start talking about the project yeah go introduce yourself again because i think uh it's great for people to get to know about your um work and where you're coming from if you don't mind yeah no problem all right cool um yeah so i'm adam colstock i'm a a computer science and a steam teacher in chicago for fourth through eighth graders uh and i've created on my um in the low res ima program um the first class of it about to graduate this summer uh so i've created subdivisio which is a tool that allows you to explore algorithmic art using one particular subdivision algorithm and so i can sort of just quickly walk through what what's happening with that um so the idea is you've got a foursided shape that you start with and then you can divide it up once using this top slider so the division that it's doing is it's taking one point along the top edge and one point along the left edge and the opposite vertex from those two edges and it's connecting those up along a point that lies along the diagonal and so if i uh start to drag that point then it varies the design because these two points are both dependent on the position of the top point sort of how far along the line it is uh what proportion of the line it takes up and if i divide it again then it took each of those three cells and applied the same rule so this top cell here took two points along the edge and the opposite vertex and the same for the other one even though it's not a square it's a different kind of uh foursided shape um it's doing the same rule but already at this point i can start to play around with the design a little bit so rather than using that same orientation for the first cell i can rotate it so you can see that that line that's connecting into the vertex is changing which orientation it has you could do that for any of the cells and then you can also add color um and so applying multiple subdivisions you start to get uh some patterns that emerge that you can play with by changing the color um of it and it has some elements of transparency so you can start to control what points are what colors are shining through and then the last thing i think that's a little bit interesting is right now it's all dependent on this top point um so if this line if this point is halfway so is this point and that point um but i could imagine those points not being tied to each other in terms of how far along the lines up they are so you can change the number of draggable points so if i have two then the top one becomes independent from the one over here and one middle is still dependent on the top one or you could have it so that all three points are independent so you can sort of play around yeah the design even more that way wow i can imagine just being sort of like hypnotized and you know i i i might often when i'm working on like a code example or something i can i can just spend hours and hours tweaking little like parameters and numbers and i i could really imagine having that kind of rich experience with this um i guess one thing i'm curious about especially with your background as a teacher um one is there a particular i mean i obviously i think this has a very wide audience like i would enjoy this as much as a fourth grader might enjoy this but um yeah is there a particular i guess i'm curious was there a particular like age group or kind of uh you know curriculum like my daughter who happens to be in fourth gr fourth grade came home today and said i learned decimals today so is there a particular um like topic and either math or uh geometry or computer science that this like specifically relates to from your teaching practice or um where did you get the idea for this i guess is kind of one way of asking the question yeah let me start with that question actually and then i can cycle around to the first one so i got the idea um i've been teaching uh for about 10 years or so and since i started teaching there's um software called dynamic geometry software um keyometer sketchpad is one example geogebra is an online version um and they really take advantage of the idea that uh there's all sorts of interesting geometric explorations you can do in a learning environment in which you can create geometric constructions by drawing points and lines and identifying relationships and constraints like things are parallel or defining particular angles but then dragging so that the things that have those relationships maintain them but those that can can very do and you can start to sort of see and explore different kinds of representations even like what the difference between an isosceles and an equilateral triangle is by um you know making it so two sides are the same length and then dragging any of the three points and seeing what's staying the same and what's changing different and you can be doing that with kids that are sort of in elementary school so i had that software um we would use it for some lessons um but i also started to like mess around and sort of create more artistic designs with it and i really enjoyed that um so one of the answers to the question is i'm interested in just a tool that will provide sort of a bridge between visual arts and mathematics so maybe you're coming to it with a visual arts background and you haven't really um thought about programming or algorithms much before um but you could step in and use this tool and it might sort of change about uh change how you think about what you're creating or maybe even lead you to want to like learn more about this kind of thing or you might be a programmer or mathematician someone that really enjoys numbers and then programming but haven't done much in the visual arts and you could come in and sort of see how some of the things that you're familiar with are being implied and applied in a visual thinking kind of way um so i think that's like my main motivation you know independent of age even um but uh certainly i i like the idea that um i teach at a school where we try and do things in an interdisciplinary way um so you know being able to come with up with a project that has an artistic output but which you could be exploring you know even with this one the idea that like how are these lines how are these points related they're the same proportion along each line so what is you know what does that mean for them to be the same proportion along the line um that could lead into something about the golden ratio if you wanted to or there's all kinds of directions you can take different things like that i i haven't been there to this place that i'm about to mention in a while because you know it's been a year of coronavirus but um the museum of math here in new york um has a lot of exhibits that i think kind of like strike a really nice balance there of being able to kind of just play um in a really sort of create playful creative uh um improvisational way um uh but kind of also and tying those to specific um kind of wellknown algorithms or techniques and kind of wandering back and forth between thinking about the math behind something versus just enjoying the sort of aesthetic quality and the sort of like surprise and discovery of it so i could really imagine um this project um working really well in you know that's what you know i think just being on the web is like in many ways just like the perfect place for it but also um like being in uh a kind of context like like the museum of math um um it really would fit right into that kind of space so great work and so if folks want to try it out i see the the best place is just to go right to the link that's right here there's a video um and um and yeah is there any any other links that people should go to or know about if they want to like learn more about this work or you uh no at this point those are the the two most direct links i would say about a month or so from now it'll probably all be put together in a website for you know my uh thesis project but uh for now those are the the best way to be able to explore it a little bit awesome great all right so this is i forget that with the for the lowres uh uh program um you're you while while this is the end of a semester there's like a big thing happening this summer which is like really more of the culmination so it's exciting to hear that you'll be continuing to work on this and i can't wait to uh follow and see where it leads great thanks wonderful thank you so much for sharing sure no problem okay i have muted and i'm wandering zooming out let's see soul train machine is back i think we should finish off with soul train machine bye is it okay if i barge on in here with my giant live broadcast sign yes oh my god that [ __ ] then um i'm uh i'm i'm running on empty here running on fumes here i've been kind of like wandering around yeah but i i thought i saw i saw soul train machine i thought this could be a way to complete the circle of this strange evening in spatial chat so um um yeah so in case anybody who's happens to be nearby i'm kind of simulcasting this um on youtube to a small audience right now um kind of wandering around so feel free to some people have done the appropriate reaction of just run away it seems like i'm near them but mary hopefully you'll stay um would you mind do you have a minute to introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about this project to take us out of this uh what's the what's the word to like close it's not the end of the evening because i know this is going on for 30 more minutes but yeah that's like as i hear my your your broadcast yes my bro yes thank you it would be my pleasure so my name is mary no terry i am a graduating itp second year and uh the project i'm presenting tonight is the first in a series of prototypes that i will be making over the next few months uh that i'm building towards what i'm calling the soul train machine so when i say soul train i mean soul train like the longrunning tv show where people showed off their amazing moves and new music in new fashion and so this is a project that's very much grounded in the vocabulary of that style of funk soul disco so i used the ml5 neural network to train a an algorithm on some very basic disco moves that i just did in front of the camera uh in or this in order to do this prototype so the two moves are and you can go to the link up here uh and test it out yourself but the two the moves are uh like a snap up here a roll and a like head shape like a tina turner style head shake um and at the moment the what i'm building towards is having those be triggers for musical events at the moment the musical events are mostly just triggered by pressing a button uh but there are some sliders where it's like if you're closer to the camera it gets uh clearer there's a lowpass filter or if you go up and down the volume goes up and down um but the idea is yeah to turn this into a standalone web app where a couple of people can join in and control music through their groovy dance moves awesome and so this can be tried out right now at this very moment just by going to that link that's right there oh i just clicked on it okay hold on i'm i'm gonna save this i'm gonna uh oh my goodness okay i'm going to uh i'm coming back to spatial chat uh i'm gonna go that'll be a perfect thing for me to test and try you know one of the things um that i that i've actually like um that i find to be a challenge with um some of these systems that do pose detection especially on the web oh my goodness and i think my i have to actually close this because my computer is about to freak out um is that people use their computer like the way that i'm right now which is kind of like hunched over it like with my face next to the laptop whereas this really is about i'm imagining and it strikes me from your description of the sort of like full body um you know like let it all out kind of experience and i you know i know that you know to the extent that you that you're still in development with this like is that something that um do you have any have you been have you tested with people is that something that you've sort of thought about of how to like uh sort of onboard people into being in the right sort of like physical space and mindset for it or oh that's a really good question and i haven't gotten to the stage of user testing inside of me and my roommates so we will see and we're all pretty out there people to begin with um but that's something that i'm definitely gonna have to keep in mind and i think uh i guess i also am aiming to create an uh a browserbased experience that is if that evokes uh a certain like time and space like time and place uh and i this is kind of for people who like me um and so uh but that's i really appreciate that question because i have a tendency to design for myself sometime yeah well it's a great way to start i don't know it's yeah it's just something that like i've just i've spent a lot of time working with the postdetection stuff as you probably uh um no and so like it's it's something that's sort of like always top of mind for me but i i love i just like like i think you have a successful interactive webbased project if you can get people to like stand up and move their whole body like it's such a nice like goal to like to break people out of um kind of their just sort of default way of sitting engaging in their computer so that's super it's super cool and exciting to see and i i i i i'm
