so do check one two checking my audio how are my levels can you hear me all right we're starting in exactly one minute what i would like to also know is can you hear the clicking adit is watching the coding train live for the first time welcome ah hello welcome to a friday episode of the coding train it has been oh i just scared my poor dog gloria who has been sleeping so quietly over there and i have been very quietly sitting up here in the attic and just made a very loud hello to all of you and she just got up from her bed and left oh well goodbye gloria you can come back no dog cam for today i do have a mouse cam um i see a bunch of people saying this is my first time live well welcome to the first your first not the first live stream of the coding train i don't know what number somebody if actually everyone's from the community wants to volunteer to do this i used to number the live streams and then i would know what number i'm on i i currently have no idea um but uh welcome um i hate to break it to you but um these live streams are kind of a mess but i hope you do enjoy this one i have a very very specific task that i want to do today before i do that task though let me quickly thank today's sponsor and i'm not sure how exactly i'm going to do this i'm going to go over here and i'm going to press this button and oh my mouse mouse cam is right in front of it um but thank you to brilliant you should check out the website and app brilliant if you're interested in math and science and lifelong learning um it's a wonderful um website has a tremendous amount of courses interactive courses that align with a lot of the content that i do on the coding train um and uh you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain and the first 200 subscribers will get 20 off i'll come back later there's actually a really i just saw it on the homepage today there's a really fun daily challenge about waves which is very related to my nature of code chapter 3 book on waves so i'm going to do that daily challenge halfway through this live stream okay um back to whoa wrong button wrong button back to here that was by the way the brilliant neural network course which is excellent um and uh stig is saying um i'm specifically here for that mess never stop messing about yeah this is actually some interesting feedback not to get too immediately off on a tangent but i have received the feedback of as the tutorial videos get more and more produced with editing and animations um some of the sort of authentic elements of the original place where i started making these videos has been lost um and of course those authentic elements i hope are here in spades today during this live stream but i am thinking about this and how to balance the desire i have for sort of higher quality video tutorials that people can get through to learn something and create a project as well as the sort of fun mess that is often the coding train so um let's uh and arnov is saying just realized it's been five years watching the coding train mid april 2016. i don't know that's just crazy um lots of stuff is coming to the coding train soon i have all sorts of crazy plans i'm not gonna get into that right now because i have a very specific job that i need to do today and um i don't know how well this is going to go but let me jump right into it um so apologies if you haven't been in a live stream before i'm not going to spend a lot of time introducing myself or what this channel is but i'm going to talk about something that i am participating in that's happening at the end of the month and i have a lot of work to do for it so and i'm like it's really bothering me that there's this little uh keying issue right here um i will let me i'm not going to worry about that right now um i'm gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna be okay with it um let me jump into what i want to do today so i'm gonna go over here um and i am going to open up no i need to use this mouse to force myself this by the way is a rollerball mouse uh i am going to open up the web browser and i am going to go to oh wait no before i even do that and that's why i need to open up processing so i'm going to open up on the desktop computer mouse mouse data collect i think is the one i'm looking for mouse data collect let me just run this so i want to be running this during the entire live stream today this is collecting data on all of my mouse movements i will come back to it but i wanted to at least set this up and running as i'm going so what am i doing today if i come back to the broadcast i went back to my track pad again everybody you know uh uh a familyfriendly show with lots of people who are under the drinking age so i don't want to say drink every time i go back to my track mad but i don't know put a quarter in the jar and donate it to a good cause every time i go back to my track pad uh let's go to a computer mouse conference computer mouse conference 2021 so the computer mouse conference um 2021 and let me just this is a different mouse i need to use to move this is a conference that's happening online it will be hosted on this page which i will uh click to um which is uh complicating the computer mouse um here is uh emma one of the organizers along with ashley lewis of the um computer mouse conference you should definitely watch this the da da of all demos videos which was performed on february 21st 2021 uh basically almost everything that i'm doing for the mouse conference is uh inspired by this particular uh performance um and so yes here are the conference organizers full names uh emma jane lewis and emma ray brumalnorton so i'm doing a bunch of things one i'm just like an incredibly enthusiastic and excited person about the computer mouse conference this is the second one i just followed it online um last year and i um have a chance to um sorry i have a sorry i'm reading the chat while i'm talking which i'm not gonna do um i have a chance to participate this year so i'm doing a couple things one there will be a simultaneous live stream hosted on the coding train during the conference um it uh it's a very i don't want to say too much about it now i'll let you find out about it as it gets announced as we planned it but there will be a live scene made by a wonderful artist um and seen maker who will be creating a live scene during during the conference so you'll want to tune in to the conference on the conference page where all the talks will be played but simultaneously there will be a scene being made and then i am also working on a video for the conference and i've really bitten off way more than i can chew here you know i am someone who has now built up a practice of being able to deliver coding tutorials and i can kind of have an idea and record a video and and work with uh matia who does the video editing and other collaborators of the coding train who help with the website and social media and all those kind of things and get that video out pretty quickly and um i'm trying to do something a little bit more creative and a little strange for the video for this conference um and so um it's kind of it's consuming me it's not exactly why i haven't been live streaming for the last month i was out of town um and didn't have my setup with me i was working but i just didn't have my setup with me but it's kind of what's now consuming me good news for all of you if you're not as interested in me being consumed with the mouse stuff is uh the conference is happening at the end of the month i'll be back to regular coding train stuff in may um i'm i'm a little bit behind i have a whole set of nature of code chapter 5 tutorials all about steering behaviors that i have yet to release there's five videos that i've recorded and are in the process um so what i'm doing today um is i want to build a couple of the coding examples for the um the conference video that i'm making um so that's what's happening today if you will bear with me for a second i um also oh whoa i'm getting some uh messages boom boom boom ding ding ding ding ding ding okay great hold on time out going back to this this view i was waiting for this to come in um i am now i'm i'm i've i've got we've got a new coding train character um that i'm also going to present to you please as you were uh talk amongst yourselves for a minute boy what am i i forgot that i was still live streaming i thought i actually like just cut myself off and put the intermission screen on but i'm still here give me a second okay we are just about i'm just about there image number two i just had to go into my direct messages to grab these images which is why i don't want to show you what i'm doing image number three and i think i've got one more to get oh my there's so many more image number four i don't think i need all of these uh and image number five there we go okay the beeping okay all right what am i doing now i'm being distracted by being at mentioned so many times uh i might have to turn off my notifications uh okay hold on almost there almost back grabbing these files um back to the coding train discord hide this and make sure i have uh where's that um in discord the streamer safe mode this is not going very well streamer mode enabled okay great got it okay and now one more button to press okay and um i'm coming back to you in three i mean i'm actually here coming back to you in three two one here we are now before i can go any further i need to figure something out so what i'm going to do and i simon thank you for all your reminders i'm i'm not doing a good job of using this mouse maybe if i just pick a different one maybe we should have i have a whole bag of old computer mics here this is actually one of my favorites this particular mouse has an actual like floating sailboat in it let's try this one see if it works i don't know if any of these work these are all um old ps2 mice and so i um have an adapter i'm gonna unplug the crayola one and let's try this one i have this amazing mickey mouse mouse um but i'll show it to you in a second but that one i couldn't get to work i don't know what i did with it actually um all right let's see how's this oh this one works really well okay this one works much better let's try this one for a little while it's also a roller roll mount look you can even see the water there okay so this is my data that i'm collecting so far um all right so what i the next thing i need to do i've got a bunch of things i need to do here one is uh right so now i can pepper these around the desktop should look kind of busy with lots of things on it oh so one thing you're not realizing probably and i'm going to just reveal this to you is that this is not actually what my desktop looks like i am going to go to too many things open uh laptop properties nope not properties laptop filters so this is what my desktop actually looks like and maybe i should just live stream with it looking exactly as it really looks it's got a solid green background but in open broadcast studio i'm keying out that background and i have this like these mouse characters there and what i need to do no no no stig is asking it's a mickey mouse mouse i gotta find it um where is my mickey mouse mouse oh here it is i hereby present to you the mickey mouse mouse um but what is very important that i do is i need to be capturing my screen this entire live stream but i i i could obviously this whole stream is being recorded and archived but it's got me in it it's got the uh the mouse cam in it so i think what i will do um is i'm just gonna open up open broadcast studio if you haven't seen this software before there we are there i am um and let me create a scene called uh desktop um and then i am going to add a uh um not window capture display capture and that's fine let's just call it so this is now capturing the full display um and then let's just check the settings um output um recording path that's fine high quality medium file size probably fine i'm afraid to make it much larger mp4 is a little bit scary because if it crashes can i make this higher i guess this will be fine right does anybody have any uh suggestions before i press record on what settings um um all right i think i'm gonna just be okay with this what if i go here video oh canvas resolution output scaled yeah this is this is this is all fine okay i'm gonna leave it as such i'm going to hit start recording so now i am recording everything that i do on my desktop the other thing that i want to record is this mouse cam footage how am i going to do that uh all right somebody tell me um jeffrey is saying you should disable window tinting in the settings so all the windows aren't green i don't know how to do that if somebody wants to give me um if so i really have to turn my notifications off i'm getting so by the way this is i'm gonna i'm in a like a crazy place right now because i have so much going on in so many different aspects of my life but we're gonna make this happen window tinting is in mac os system preferences the thing is i don't really mind um what i'm gonna use this for i don't really mind having the window tinting i think but the stream is laggy is that i've that's the second message i saw about that you know i don't see anything being laggy but what can i um hopefully it's um just i'm not so not um everybody hm all right so here's what i need now i was really by the way i was setting up for this live stream starting at 9am this morning and obviously i didn't finish because i'm still trying to set them things up i want to also record this so what's the equivalent i have open broadcast studio running already to stream so i don't want to record to disk with open broadcast studio but what can i use this is hooked up to my windows computer just to record the output to disk of this particular camera as one big video file while i'm streaming um windows um oh you know what i wonder if the chroma keying is causing it to be really slow so let's turn off the chroma keying the fact that obs has to chroma key the desktop let's see i have by the way i also have this mouse which i'm using to control the windows computer so like uh let me turn off and see if that um let me turn off the chroma keying that was just to make it visually nicer for those of you watching but it's more authentically gr this is actually what i'm uh streaming um okay vbs i'm being told um so tell me if this uh fixes oh no it does look kind of choppy even in open broadcast studio why do you think that is that's weird i've never had this issue i could try unplugging and plugging back in that always usb capture hdmi highest frame let's just give me a second here let me unplug this no signal i'm gonna plug it back in no it's still kind of choppy the the good news is what i'm i mean i think it's still watchable and my you know this is the important recording that i'm making now which i don't think has any issues in it um reboot yeah uh handbrake uh the capture of your laptop is low fps yeah i totally agree all right i can try to debug this a little bit longer let's try this so now i'm doing something crazy on my back i switched cameras let's go back to this device default custom whoa highest fps match output fps whoa now it's gone device default i i have a better idea of what to do a little bit extreme this but i'm gonna do it is i think this is probably not ah i think i had it into one of the lower speed usb ports that i didn't realize let's see if this fixes it oh so it's gone now which it should be thank you all for bearing with me here this is uh okay yeah fixed right that's fixed it was in a um i unplugged my whole setup when i went away because i was using some of the equipment and i plugged the hd the hdmi capture uh device into a lower speed usb port so i think we should be good now um okay uh now the next thing i need to do is i need to re of course this is now totally frozen nothing works right uh properties uh this is so uh and here we go there now this is back um now what i need to do is figure out how to record um record this camera so i'm still looking for a window a piece of windows sort of software um that just i could i could guess i could run another instance of obs right whoa i could run another instance of obs and just have that one recording just this to disk um let's see about that um now because this is a little bit ridiculous what i'm doing here but let's see what do i have here okay what piece of software do i have that will allow me to record this camera um i'm looking at all the software i have on this computer video lan what's that oh that's vlc i don't think the voice recorder windows um powerpoint screen recording zoom should i just use zoom i'm gonna use zoom and log into a zoom meeting this is actually not the worst idea because we'll record it to the cloud all right this is crazy i'm gonna open up zoom [Laughter] uh because i know this will work this is totally ridiculous what i'm doing i'm gonna do it anyway um let's see oh please wait for the host to start this meeting no i am the host i am the host you have found that out haven't you join with computer audio start video now let's go to this overhead camera as my video and oh we can't access the camera because it's being used by obs i forgot that windows can't have two pieces of software all right i'm gonna give up on that i'm giving up on this i'm recording my desktop that's good enough um this um this will be the recording this little box will be the recording of the mouse movements [Laughter] okay all right hi again is it 10 30 how am i doing terribly terribly terribly terribly thank you all you are the kindest nicest most wonderful people on the internet who are very patient with me um yeah i could use the virtual camera so many things i could do to record it but i'm i'm giving up on it i don't think it's that big of a deal if i'm not separately recording me using the mouse all right so the two projects i would like to build and i'm curious to see if anybody um has a strong preference as to what i start with but and actually you know what forget it i'm gonna start with what i plan to start with and what i know how to do here is one of the core ideas that i am going to talk about in my mouse conference video i'm going to make a very basic p5js and this is um i guess i'll just leave this up here again i have to try to use this mouse i'm going to make a very basic uh p5.js example for you right now and let's make the font a little bit bigger i think i usually put it at 32. if mousex is greater than 200 background um red i need to look at my script hold on because in the script that i've written that i'm going to record i guess i'm going to record it later i could just do whatever i did here all right i'll match it i haven't recorded it yet i'm going to record some voiceover to explain this example so i'm going to say if the mouse is on the righthand side of the window this is bothering me i use the wrong mouse again but that's down here there we go um then color the background red otherwise color the background green if it's on the left hand and i definitely should not use green because i'm keying out the color green that's the wrong mouse i have so many different mice all right so let's say it'll be blue if it is on the left hand side so this is this is one of the first things that you not you specifically you the person watching this live stream right now but the royal you so to speak um might learn in an intro to coding course so this is something that i that as a first example of a couple things one conditional logic and thank you um uh object is making an excellent uh suggestion which it would make more sense for me to write in width divided by two in order to if i were to change the window the canvas size now it still works i might also just for um being able to see some see kind of what's going on i might want to draw a line from the center to the bottom and boy i got my x's and y's mixed up line of x comma y and then x comma y there we go so i see that line uh maybe we'll make that um a little brighter and uh we'll make it a little bit thicker i'm using the wrong mouse again so now we can see blue red blue red red blue red blue so i have this kind of theory here i don't know if it's really a theory but one of the things i want to discuss and think about is what does it mean that uh how do how do what is an effective way to teach and understand machine learning and so there's a talk um kyle mcdonald you can find this online the kik festival there's a recording of his talk on vimeo from the kick festival talks about and this is not his original idea but he has a really nice quote in that talk about it talks about programming as writing instructions for the computer to follow i'm paraphrasing here of course whereas machine learning is instead of writing the instructions for the computer to follow is providing the examples for the um uh for the computer to learn from to then develop the instructions right so if if a um so in other words here are some here are some examples here's some examples of the mouse on the righthand side of the screen here are some examples of the mouse on the lefthand side of the screen can you learn from that to extrapolate knowing whether the mouse is on the righthand side or the lefthand side that is the essence in some ways of machine learning as opposed to kind of traditional programming which is here's a very explicit rule so i like this scenario because it is incredibly ridiculous right i don't believe i don't know that rewriting this code with a neural network to decide whether to color the background blue or red what value does that add it's like tremendous amount of overkill um in terms of just this if this is what i want the program to do but my theory here what i want to suggest here is that this could be an effective way to rewrite this code to do uh and and peter in the chat thank you for this is saying can be described as explicit versus implicit as well which is excellent um terminology to sort of think about in this context so what i want to do right now and i'm giving myself about 25 minutes is i want to rewrite this example to in to to do exactly the same thing when i move the mouse left and right the color of the background changes but rather than have an if statement i'm going to have a neural network uh operate on the uh classifying the points as left and right hand side now you might be saying like are you insane i mean well clearly the answer to that is somewhat uh you know we can make arguments on both sides but i you know how are you gonna do that in 25 minutes so you know i'm not going to build a neural network from scratch although i do have like a 10part video series um and um what i'm going to do instead is use the ml5 library so let's get started and i'm going to go to ml5 js and i am using the wrong mouse again i am going to get go to the get started page i am going to find uh this and so i can import the ml5 library into index.html i better save this by the way and i'm going to call this mouse learning that's the title of my talk mouse learning and i don't need the sound library so i know that second one is the sound library so let's paste in this and the other thing i i really prefer to do is um hold on ml5 and i just oops ml5 github wrong mouse again i can't i can't get it right i should switch by the way i need a like reminder to switch mice every every once in a while so i have a lot of fun ones to try um uh library uh releases where are the releases 0.6.1 so i i prefer rather than saying latest to put just put a version number in um and so what do i need let's let me duplicate this i'm going to do duplicate i should probably just look so i have these as separate versions and i want to have a variable and i'm going to call it model for machine learning model and the model is an ml5 neural network and typically when you create an ml5 neural network the idea is that you have to give it some configuration information about what are the inputs and what are the outputs so and um so i'm going to make a javascript object called options and the inputs are i forget how this works so i'm going to just try to do it from memory and then i'll look at the reference we'll see where i went wrong i just need an x and a y so those will be the inputs to the neural network right the inputs the inputs actually oh i just need the x oh my goodness this is a neural network with one input how insane let's let's let's go with the simplest possible i mean it's again this is absurd um yeah and simon's giving me a very good note here which is that um i shouldn't call this model we'll call this i'll just call this brain because this is going to be the brain of my program because model is a builtin variable maybe in p5 and it can cause a conflict the outputs are let's call it left and right as the sort of labels of what i'm classifying then i want to say debug is true which is um not so important right now but i'll show you where that comes into play later when i start debugging the neural network so um let's give myself a little bit more space to code and let me hit run things are still working no errors we're in good shape here i think and by the way i'm still by the this is all of my mouse movements so far from today that i'm collecting this data because i'm going to do something else with this data i'll come back to that uh yeah i'll come back to that in a little bit that's using something called the java robot class which i definitely want to refer to okay so now that i have this what's next i want to i need to collect some data um and and just to be clear about this um if if this is all completely new to you um i would suggest this tutorial set of tutorials that i have i'm kind of redoing very in a very fastpaced way this um ml5 train your own neural network save data save model there's a regression example so all of these video tutorials that i have on the channel if you're brand new today and machine learning is totally new to you i've never seen ml5 before these videos would hopefully give you some more context okay so i'm going to add the mouse pressed function then i believe whenever i press the mouse i should just make a bit of data that has mouse x mouse y you know what would be great the input should actually just be mouse x i should call the label input mouse x and i can't bring myself to not use mouse y but i'm gonna and then and then the object i can use that fancy enhanced object literal by just saying this is the data that's the input to the neural network uh oh and thank you soren for um for uh providing links about what i'm talking about into the chat that's uh wonderful it's so helpful and i so appreciate when people do that okay next up the um the label so here's where it gets starts getting really absurd oh so this is the input that's the input now the output is honestly like i kind of lost i don't know what i'm doing i'm going to assume the output is left and then if mouse x is greater than width divided by two the output should be let's just call this label right now label is left the label should be uh right and then i believe i can say brain dot add data inputs and uh and then i think i'm supposed to put the label in an array there's a lot of different ways you can do this with ml5 and i'm kind of guessing as i'm going because i don't like know it off the top of my head because you could have multiple outputs multiple classifications or regressions so maybe this isn't the friendliest way to write it but the idea is the inputs are just one thing the mousex value and the output is either left or right so let's just run this to see if i get any errors click click click click i think it would be helpful if i console log something like um adding data mouse x um adding i'll just do like this input mousex comma comma output label so we'll see something hopefully up here now yeah right right left left so the um the console log is showing me stuff that's correct so that's i'm adding that data to the neural network and then uh i guess i'm going to use keep rest i can make a button let's make a button to make this example a little bit nicer let's make a variable called train button train button equals create button train for coding train then i will say train button mouse pressed and then brain dot train and i believe when i is that right mouse pressed oh no hold on function i have no idea what i'm doing i forgot how to write javascript to call the train function now there's also options i think the only option i really care about is something called epochs and i'm just going to make that one right now and epoch is a training cycle over all of the data so again everything i'm doing here is uh um basically uh absurd because i am trying to train an all powerful neural network with one input and one output equivalent to just is the mouse on the left and right hand side so how much data i have what all the sort of like what's the learning rate all these things are kind of really arbitrary right now let me just see if this gives me any errors and by the way this is now where debug comes in so once i hit this train button i should see a debug window that's showing me a graph of the loss so as the neural network is learning from these examples right these examples of and i'll do this now of like right right right right right right right right left left left left left left left left left left left left left left left i should really draw something as i'm doing this it'll be much more interesting visually because ultimately this uh screen capture that i'm doing is going to be um in this video that i'm making and so i'm now let me i'm going to keep going but i'm going to add something to draw because i think that'll be kind of important so i'm going to hit train and let's see what happens and i got an error so that's good i mean not good that i got an error but cannot read property to lower case of null huh line 16 brain train all right let's let's look at the ml5 neural network documentation it's time um and uh train no train model and and train oh that looks like i did it kind of right um let's see what did i get wrong here also just afraid that my i want to make sure my um obs thing is still recording yeah okay it looks like it is i kind of want to stop it just to check the file but i'll keep going um what did i get wrong cannot read property two lowercase of no hold on let's look at the javascript console here let me hit stop because oh yeah this is something in ml5 now is this a bug that i found or um hold on let's look let's see if i let's look at inputs well i could also do it as just a number no average temperature oh oh it's not an op no that's right oh left right that looks this looks right i guess i could say output label is that actually what i'm supposed to be doing is it just freaked out because there's only one data point all right let's just because i'm like it's making me paranoid that it's gonna like not work without at least two inputs because why would you ever have a neural network with one input so let me um add a second input here and let me look for the add data function inputs is an object output oh you know that's another way i could do it i think maybe actually the way that i should be doing this is this let's try it this way um okay still got an error what if i say this here weird uh i haven't been working with the recent ml5 let's just try like this whoops is there not a point one whoa i messed something up okay so that at least this error is not like some new error oh oh my goodness master stormer in the discord member chat i forgot something so important where's my sound effect of me being very sad like this could be my sound effect me being happy uh i forgot um the default task that ml5 performs is a regression which says has the output of the neural network be a floating point number so let's just see what this gives me yeah there we go something else went wrong but that's fine uh all right all right that's fine okay let's get to um this is we're getting closer now that was definitely an issue let's try um i want to go back to this i don't know why that i wanted to do it this way it kind of doesn't make sense maybe but one two three four one two three four uh train so what just happened there shoot okay let's go back to an earlier version of ml5 same error that's good i just want to make sure it's not like okay what did i miss in terms of how i'm setting this up uh i think the let me look at my uh examples that go along with uh let me look at this particular example to find out so this example is from it's basically i'm rebuilding what is in uh this code example and if i go to the web editor now um yeah yeah i got it i got it xy label oh i did forget to normalize the no but that i did forget to normalize the data before i trained it um and inputs x y add data target where's it is an object with the label okay so let me try to mirror this an object with the label so and what did i just say i forgot to do i forgot to say in the train button brain dot normalize data now this should really be the same as that example that's the only thing um it should work without normalizing it like in terms of not giving me an error it just should be kind of awkward so let's try this try clicking clicking clicking clicking clicking the train let's give it some more epochs because it's this like so fast what did i do that's different from so did why did hmm change outputs back to left right i don't think i'll try that it really shouldn't matter actually the interesting thing is honestly like this is not necessary at all um ml5 is set up to once you've added data to like figure out what the configuration is of the inputs and the outputs so let me try and let's do it this way i want to say console.log inputs and console.log let's just look at both of these just to be sure two three yeah so that's this is what i'm putting in you can see it down here let's call train let's look at this e is not a function call back oh oh i know what the problem is i'm such a dumdum i think i just forgot to be no yeah so that like kate weakman is suggesting your model might be too complex to be trained with so little dina dana no no i honestly i think what this is is i'm just forgetting like an important step which is that um i do need to give it at least one callback like i don't think there's anything in the model in the ml5 code that will account for um when you if you don't bother to give it like you finished training callback i i literally think it's just this which i should have realized from the jump so i'm clicking i'm clicking i'm gonna hit train yeah see i just didn't have a call back sorry everybody that was the problem uh and i realized i'm kind of like sitting in front of some of this so that you can't see but hopefully you're following all right so now and and i would like to be able to see more of the code so let me do this all right so the uh the thing that i would like to do now is uh have it draw the the data so um can i um i mean this is i'm just gonna do this myself uh i think i could get the actually all right let's let's let's look at the data uh in uh ml5 itself so i can figure out where it is so i'm clicking and then i want to um basically evaluate myself i think if i look at this brain object and i apologize that this is here because now i want you to look here um and this too many mice this i can close um this here is i believe it's in brain.data maybe training array zero um what if i say brain.normalize data and now it's there so where was it before i called normalize add data load data save data that's so weird where it's got to be saved somewhere hold on let me run this again okay now this is silly because i could just look this up probably in the ml5 documentation data training array hmm where did the data go metadata add data load data normalized data so strange like why is the data nowhere until neural network data ah raw here it is so this is um you know i could just save my own mouse clicks but i would like to get accesses so this was uh brain dot neural network data dot data dot raw okay how are we doing oh it's 11 o'clock we're really close i'm really close i'm going to move through this a little bit so now in draw i want to say let data equals what i say brain dot neural network data dot data dot raw right and then for let um row of data console.log row let's put this in mouse press just for a second so i can see if this is actually right so yeah i got an object with x's mouse x mouse y so if i take this and go here then i can say um circle um row dot x's dot mouse x row dot x's dot mouse y fill 255. so let's do that errors whoops no stop console logging am i in draw oh i need to give it a um actual size there we go okay great so that's that and then uh fill you know what i should make the labels red and blue right so let's make the labels red and blue that way i can just say fill um row.wise.label and i shouldn't have this anymore and we can say no stroke and there we go okay great okay so now i have i am i'm ready for the next step here which is to see if the model oh and sorry this is totally in your way again um okay sorry about that one two three four let's see if i can get it to work with like i don't know 20 data points that's a lot all right now i'm going to train the model and i guess i should give it more epochs let's give it a 50 epochs and i kind of want to go back to not having mouse y let's go back to no mouse y okay because now we should be able to do that uh oh wrong mouse uh and now wait what just happened oh because oh but i do want the mouse i do want if i'm going to draw it okay fine i'll keep the mouse why it's it's it's irrelevant information but i'm going to keep it i'm going to keep it just for my own sanity right now because i also need to finish this so let's also while i'm here let's say um hold on i can do this i can do this i can do this what am i doing next ah is trained is trained as false when the training is complete is trained is true and then in draw if is trained the inputs i'm going to make new inputs is mouse x mouse y then the output the the output is take the brain and call classify i'm going to try calling classify sync so normally sync would require an asynchronous callback classifier require an asynchronous callback but i am just going to try it with classify sync to see if this work those inputs and then i should be able to say background outputs index 0 dot label i know i'm not explaining all the pieces i'll once again refer you to uh the video tutorial series where i go through how this works in great detail i will explain this if it actually works which i don't necessarily think that it will so now i'm just going to give it a few data points on each side i'm going to hit train the model is being trained over 50 epochs i think this now should probably just go over here or something and i can hide this oh look at that look at that folks all right that's a little bit insane to me the what it's doing with the dots once i've trained the model but um let's add let's add a little stroke um that is wild so i have now changed my did i right this if statement right this if statement right here which is now commented out is doing exactly the or this neural network is with the inputs of mouse x and mouse y which i believe is completely unnecessary here is now doing the actual work the same work as this particular if statement i have finished this particular project now let me give it some nice kind of training all the way up until the edge there and by the way what i really should demonstrate now is that i think i could also get rid of that line and i could have more um uh other shapes okay ready now i'm gonna hit train we're seeing the loss go down over 50 epochs i'm going to hide this debug panel and here i am on the right hand side i have blue the left hand side is red now notice it's not perfect like it appears perfect if i do it really fast and we could do something i could visualize the entire like solution space right i could iterate over every single pixel and get the output color that would certainly be interesting to do um i don't know that i have time to do it right now a guy is saying it's cooler when the dots disappear um oh and i want to swap them out so let's do this again but let's try a new mouse i actually really want to try um this so this is a um giant rollerball mouse called the trackman vista let's give this one a try see if i can get this crazy example to work with this one i also want to get rid of the line and try to make like a circle in the middle so like can i make the equivalent of a button basically or roll over so let's see i'm unplugging this mouse yeah diagonal model i think i'm going to do a circular one i mean this is very similar to my perceptron example all right so first let's put this here is this actually working oh my god this actually works oh this is very weird how do i use this thing did anybody actually use these okay oh my god okay now i'm going to go over here i'm going to click this button wait is this a button i can click yeah on the side with my thumb right here okay you know what i should have done is i should have i should plug you know what i could do i could do this right now i don't know if this is a good idea or not because i haven't been doing this the whole time but i'm gonna um i'm gonna try why not it's caution to the wind um this is there's so many reasons why this is a bad idea i was gonna just plug this camera into this actual laptop and then just bring it up on the desktop and it would actually be recorded and that way i think that would be fun to do let me do that okay so um let's first get rid of the and i'm i'm over time here because i need to take my break but i will get to that in just a few minutes um there that goes away i'm unplugging it where is it plugged into it's plugged into here now i am plugging it into this usb port okay now oh my god i can't do it i gotta use the track pad just for time right now uh new no quick time and new movie recording is that what i want yeah but i want to change to this camera which is now this then i can oh i could actually this is i could have just been recording this the whole time and i mean is this going to kill my machine to also and it's so bright um can i um slower the brightness oh there we go um i'm gonna throw caution to the wind and record this also oh i could have been doing this the whole time and then it's also over here it's behind me now i'm over here will that fade away that um i'm recording button guess yeah there we go there we go okay now it's still kind of bright oh you hear me differently now wait was this whole time i wasn't using this microphone oh my god was i using a low quality mic this whole time and nobody said anything hold on let's check the mic test test test oh i think it is this mic now maybe it wasn't before this is a much higher quality mic that maybe i was not using all right so now here we go this is the grand finale oh wait wait wait i want to take out the line well let's keep the line for a second i'll do it first this okay this is very hard yeah i should bring the exposure down i know okay maybe it was the same mike is fine it switched a while ago interesting all right let's train i should give it more i should have given it more epochs that was my mistake okay ah oh this is very strange what i'm doing okay here we go ready everybody now i'm gonna hit the train button i definitely should have given it more epochs but that's fine now we're gonna hide this console and here we go yay it works wild i don't know about you but i absolutely love what i'm doing so uh three cheers for myself from me to myself pat's on the back um i'm hoping this will make an interesting video after i capture the stuff and do some voiceover um but let's try one more thing i'm going to comment out this line hit save then i'm going to run the sketch again and oh wait a second oh no no no okay okay oh i cheated i mean it's all cheating everything is cheating but i cheated like a whole extra level beyond my original thing that i thought i was cheating which is that um i meant to actually have to manually set the label so uh let's let's add that drop down i'm going to make a a variable called drop down drop down equals create select then i can think i can see drop drop down dot option red drop down dot option blue and now and i run this sketch i should have a drop down here that i um where i can just change from red to blue and then that's really like i shouldn't be able to automate what the label is and so this should be a dropdown dropdown.value so i have to actually set it hello hello um by the way am i i'm very like orange today i feel like it's not just the hat maybe it's the lighting or something in here i do have a way of maybe it's because i'm getting a lot of sunlight in here um okay i'm just checking my messages i have to pick up children from school at one and i'm actually not nowhere near close to where that is right now so i definitely have to be out off off by by a little afternoon um okay so now what i am looking to do for real changes to a hundred because i want to see it train for longer and then um is this all i meant to do um there was something else that was in my head here a second ago but now i've forgotten oh let's try it red red red so like if i do this red and then i change this to blue and try to do a bunch of blue like here in the center and then if i hit train it's having some trouble differentiating do i need more data blue in the center red on the outside uh it's getting confused over here but you can see that i am getting some results now um let's try this again but with if you'll bear with me if you'll humor no you know what i'm going to force myself to use this mouse maybe i should try a different mouse what else do i have in here by the way i have this really awesome um star trek like communicator mouse but um unfortunately it's the wrong i don't have an adapter it's like an old uh serial port can i take the exposure down even further here you can't really um i can do weird stuff like this though come on back okay all right um try i have a memorex three button mouse i really like this um i've got some of these old microsoft i'm really sad that this one doesn't work let's just try it just to be 100 sure because the mickey mouse mouse is really the best of them all oh that's the pro oh so i know what the problem is and i thought about this all of these clicks are causing the training data to be inputted so is that if that's a way to say it um there's i i know what to do i'm gonna say uh let i only want uh clicks that are on the canvas and then i'm gonna say canvas mouse pressed training data and then we'll call this function uh training data i knew there was something that i was doing wrong uh this is a this is a fool's errand that i'm trying because i i i really tried trying to fix this mouse yesterday but let's just see so now this mouse the mickey mouse mouse you can see the button works the button works but the cursor does not move and i've tried like i'm opening it up we can see the actual like roller mechanism that like even manipulating the roller mechanism myself um i am not able to get the thing to move i could build an object detection machine learning model to track the mouse and then control the cursor with that that's a whole other project i'm sad that i don't have time to do that maybe next weekend next live stream um okay so this one has to go away unfortunately what i i i i really like i really have failed in um my live poll software because if i had really ever finished that project i could just have a poll right now for people to vote on a mouse i do really like this one because it says packard bell on it i don't think packard bell exists anymore so let's try this packard bell one okay there we go now we're trying the packard bell one how do i wish i could is it like i'm just gonna have to live with i could actually what i could do um is i could lower the amount of light in this room so let me do this um because i have these um elgato key lights that i really love and if i turn them down like let me just turn them off for a second like i'm in the dark but at least now this doesn't look so crazy let's give myself a little bit more light wow oh that's the temperature i was playing with the color temperature not the brightness so um let me keep turning this down uh and then uh well if i just turn these off is that even better all right i'm turning the lights off just for a second it's fine this camera doesn't need the lights okay ready here we go oh boy this one's hard to use i move so slowly which is actually fine i could adjust the settings of the speed okay now let me go to a blue okay now let's try drum roll please training come on come on loss oh keep going keep going oh i need more than 100 epochs it'll keep going but that's probably gonna do it so now blue red blue red look at that beautiful i made like a rollover button a roll over with machine learning and an old timey mouse i love it i love it it's ridiculous and i love it oh yeah so um right uh people but people are making a lot of good interface improvement suggestions which absolutely do make sense okay um let's do a couple things here let me um come over here and hit stop so this is save that was only 12 minutes mouse movements save that to the desktop one okay so i have this archival footage which can get placed into the video that i'm making then i also want to let's go back to obs and tell it to stop recording where by the way i'm just gonna um just because i've got my um obs configuration i want to look at uh okay yeah that's fine let's see how that um turned out because it should be here this is video capture of my entire session just now awesome i think i got that so this is good raw material footage that i'll be able to add in the background or something of this video that i'm making okay i still have more to do today this is not the end of the stream although we're closing in on the end um first let me close some of this stuff out let me click click here so this by the way uh it's pretty interesting to see these are all of the mouse movements that i have done today during this live stream and you can see now uh over here like kind of this is the cluster of all that stuff that i was doing and this is probably maybe the menu of the p5 web editor it's kind of interesting to see this constellation of mouse movements let me at a minimum just take a screenshot of this but also if i click i believe i have it set up to if this code was written correctly which i'm going to build a little example like this in a moment um i should be able to look at the data folder and see that these are csvs of all of the mouse clicks of the mouse locations and timestamps so actually speaking of which um i could really use some help from the community let me turn my lights on let me i really need to do my sponsor segment uh so i don't get fired here um but um let me just briefly mention um something that is a sort of a call that i would love help with i would like to train a sketch rnn style model out of all these mouse movements because part of what i'm doing is then to have an example of an ai that is just operating the mouse for me someone's at front door yeah i'm sorry i can't come to the door right now hope it's not any of you um uh so um what um so yeah so if i don't actually know how to do this i was looking at this thing called like deep svg i'm sort of out of my i'm kind of running out of time here to be able to add this example to the things that i'm building for the mouse conference so um if anybody else happens to have a lead or want to help uh figure out a way to train a sequential model off of the mouse locations sketch rnn deep svg are examples of it doesn't have to be done well or accurately just to be something that's kind of like fun that i can kind of get to work you know huge benefit if i could do it with tensorflow.js but um i'll take any help that i can get um hit me up on twitter at shifement but before i go to the second half of this live stream where i'm going to look at this java robot class that's in this example i want to take a minute uh or so and i've lost my mouse here to thank today's sponsor um brilliant so let me pull up the brilliant website um and let me pull up my notes over here that i have uh that i seem to have lost that's okay please hold highly professional operation i've got going on here it's funny i wrote up all these notes and then i by accident closed the window and i don't really need the notes because um you know i it's very easy for me to talk about brilliant because i use it regularly myself and what i find to be the most wonderful part about brilliant and i think i can take the banner away now that i have the website up is the way that it is provides an alternate modality for learning that's different from what i do in video tutorial so hopefully you the viewer of the coding train like to watch my videos you learn something you have a little fun maybe you make a creative project for me in addition i do watch a lot of tutorials video tutorials and i especially like other people's live coding live streams but a really fundamental i think in critical way to learn is through practice you know it's not memorizing it's not watching lectures although those can be great too being someone who delivers lectures but um doing it yourself and so brilliant is a website that really allows you to do it yourself and i think the thing for me to really highlight are these courses and you can see our beautiful geometry statistics scientific infinity oh the infinity one is so so so good uh computer science fundamental introduction neural networks mathematical fundamentals prealgebra scientific thinking um you know i've been doing my kids are in um fourth and sixth grade and i i'm like they're like please stop bothering me like we could do our math homework on our own but i'm like can i please do my math homework with you and so when they don't let me i could just go to brilliant and kind of do my own math homework so um it's a it's a wonderful website full of courses you can just sign up for free i'll put the banner um right here you know if you sign up um just for free it actually like helps me out a little bit lets them know that you found brilliant through the coding train if it's something that really appeals to you and you want to get the full premium subscription to unlock all of the features um by going through that link you will also get a 20 off coupon i'll also mention that it's actually a really great thing to give as a gift so sometimes you know if you don't know what to buy somebody and you don't want to like you know just keep collecting more material goods um giving somebody a subscription for learning um is a wonderful um idea for a gift so i would definitely also suggest that as well let's what i like to do i just be you know i usually like to poke through some of the courses but um i really want to quickly just look at this ride the wave um challenge that i did look at earlier um ben i immediately noticed it because it is a really really related to if i go to nature of code on my website and if i get to chapter three you can see these videos like graphing the sine wave um additive waves um so if you want to think about waveforms and go deeper into them a lot of the stuff that i that i'm doing with physics simulation there's tons more content on and brilliant and i've already lost so let's look at this one and see if we can solve this together and i've lost my view of the chat so let me just grab my view of the chat um so that i can see if anybody's telling me anything super important um okay so look at these two graphs if they both remind you of polynomials you're right can we say something more about the relationship between these two graphs now i already know what the relationship is because i looked at this earlier i haven't looked at what the challenge question is yet but i did look at um just this sort of like written description so i'm gonna just i'm gonna i'm gonna play some uh awaiting music and think about this i'll look in the chat see if anybody wants to offer a suggestion interestingly oh yeah no this is what i expect yeah i was trying to look for i was trying to look for for me what's important to note is look at these peaks and valleys right up here this peak is around like negative three and what's happening at negative three oh it's right around zero this peak is around one and what's happening there at one oh look it's at zero see what about this valley here negative one negative one oh look at that it's right around zero so ever heard the term the slope the slope refers to what the kind of like what uh you can think of like the tangent like if i were to draw a line that's tangent like the slope i've like lost my ability to use words um but uh let's let's read because it'll it'll explain this you know here we go we've got the answer the derivative the reason i was coming with slope is like i think it's the music it must be the music as the top of this curve levels off the tangent to that is a flat line the slope the change the rate of change in that curve is suddenly zero um at those peaks and values the derivative being the rate of change i talked about this a lot in my videos about position and velocity velocity being the change in position so this graph i if i've read this correctly is the derivative it is graphing the slope of the tangent to this curve and so that's why you'll see that these peaks and values uh peaks and val that peaks and valleys is where um the derivative is zero and i'm i'm sure i've gotten this not exactly right oh look at this and this is the other thing i love about brilliant is um it gives you i i was like trying to like use my mouse cursor but here is a really wonderful interactive environment now here's what i love about brilliant also i want to make this as a p5 sketch now so so badly but i can't because i don't have time to do that right now but i should come into a whole um session with like that but um uh so anyway you can read a lot more you can sort of see uh more explanation but let's um let's go down to the challenge so this is today this is a graph one of the three graphs below represents the derivative of the function graphed above okay which one they all kind of look the same to me this is going to be hard well if i go with my peaks and valleys right valley at zero peak at one value two peak at three so the derivative should cross zero at zero one two three oh so it's this one or uh zero one no so a or b what about c ah so it's definitely not c i've eliminated c so it's a or b um the other thing i think i could do is here it's increasing so the derivative should be positive and here the it's decreasing so the derivative should be negative is that right so it's not this one because this is going down and then after one it's going up it should be going up oh well it's the value is increasing but like the rate of change actually is going up up up up up then it's going down down down to zero then it's going up up up then it's slowing down right so i i it's not just like what is the literal value changing it's how is that how is it changing so i think oh no no that's right it's b because it's the rate of change is going up up is increasing it's all it's positive that whole time it's hard to see because this looks like a straight line to me but it's like increasing more rapidly and it's increasing more slowly then it levels off it's decreasing more rapidly so that matches up with b i think i see i see a b in the chat from damien right and simon most like very accurately states what does this have to do with the wave series though it has more to do with calculus and trig and ultimately that's absolutely correct so the only thing that has to do with the wave series is visually they match and i i think i saw that and that's what grabbed me um but you're absolutely right um i do think it does it is interesting to think about how you might uh think about waves as sort of more polynomial forms or how you might be able to like bring these two concepts closer together but that is correct that the it's this is really more of a calculus problem all right let's do b i don't even know if this is operational i'm gonna get my one day streak now decreasing rapidly slowly has to do with the second derivative like acceleration to velocity velocity position thank you yeah uh and here we go oh i got it correct okay great i got my one day streak because i haven't done it i didn't do a challenge yesterday so um this is there's and this is why i love there's all sorts of wonderful communitybased explanations so um you know for me uh and what i would really suggest you do is if you participate in these challenges try to solve them with p5 and code and then go back to them and and by the way if you want to also learn i meant to show you these but like this for example uh brilliant has a whole course on learning python so you can see it's interactive and you can type code in it um as well as this neural network example as well so um thank you to um brilliant for being the uh sponsor of today's live stream uh i'm gonna take a short three or four minute break i have like half an hour left to look at the java robot class when i come back um so stick around if you can if you have a few minutes to sign up through this link it brilliant um you can do so for free and if it uh and if you're interested in the obviously the premium subscription you can get a discount there okay so see you all in approximately uh hopefully a little bit less than five minutes i'll be right back sorry i hit the mute button on the music so the whole time i can hear it in my monitor but none of you could hear it do do okay i am coming back here for uh what is uh simon most accurately states is not the second half of the stream i think i can say part two part two will be much shorter than uh part one uh thanks again to brilliant um all right so now before i start coding this part what i need to do is a couple things i need to get my recording going again so i'm going to start recording my desktop so that's recording then i need to get my mouse cam going also uh which i should be able to do this way and just move it over here like this and shrink it up and hit um hit record this is the way i should have been doing this all along by the way okay so mouse cam is recording but we also need to pick a mouse because this one was this one's not really very usable okay so what do i have left i i did i do have this lovely crayola mouse that i don't think i used yet so let's use the crayola mouse um there we go plugging it in okay now hopefully everybody can hear me and see me this mouse works pretty well so that's good um the other thing i want to make sure that i do is open up the data collect because i do want to be running data collection in the background that might cause a problem because i'm going to i don't know if the java robot class can be used in multiple sketches but i'm gonna assume that this is okay for the moment all right so what is it that i want to do demonstrate to you um uh robot demo java it's weird that it's called um and i'm gonna save this just on the desktop um it's weird that it's called the robot class so i do need a browser i close the browser i need the browser open uh java robot so what is this java robot and i don't know what version of java i'm using in processing but let's let's go to this one so the the java robot class so okay hold on everybody i got a lot of explaining to do about what's going on here um processing is a programming environment that i use quite often um it is what i used almost exclusively before i started doing a lot of my work and teaching in javascript in the browser with p5.js processing is built with the programming language java and even though it is a sort of closed environment with a full drawing api and a lot of other sort of like core functionality and a lot of extended libraries you actually from within processing have access to anything java can do and java as a language i i don't know the right way to state this but it's kind of like the way that i think about it and i'll be curious to hear what you think is it's not the best language at anything but it's one of the best languages for everything like it's very hard to come up with something you can't do in java so it doesn't excel at any given thing but it just you can kind of do anything and it's crossplatform there's this whole job of virtual machine stuff there's a lot of complexity in terms of um and it is a little bit out of date and browsers don't support java applet anymore all of that aside i love i love the job jivin it loves me so um it's my first programming love everyone should feel about something like the way that i feel about java or maybe not i don't know if that's just weird i gotta hit stop here because it's bothering me that there's this error here is it still i don't know i don't know if i'm going to run this data collection while i'm doing this but all right so the reason why i'm getting excited here is if i go back to here i can look at this java robot class which is part of java.awt so i can actually say like if i just say robot robot processing is going to say like i don't know what that is the class robot does not exist but if i now say import java.awt.robot that error goes away now i can say setup and so the two the things that you could do with the robot class is to one you can track mouse well you can do a lot with it but what i'm interested in it for is it's it's a it's a tool for automation of different aspects of the sort of on the operating system level of what the use the user is doing so in relationship to the mouse i can know at any point where the mouse is now you might think that i can do that anyway in processing mouse x mouse y well no that's limiting the mouse interaction with this particular window same thing with p5 like i can know what the mouse is doing within a particular canvas or browser window but on from the operating system as a whole i need something else another layer and that's what the java robot class does in addition i can move the mouse around i can automate things if you've ever used like you know an uh an automator right i can actually have the mouse move according to logic and code so ideally what i want to do is track all of my mouse movements train a machine learning model i guess i could just use like a markov chain or something if i can't figure out how to do it with a neural network easily but um i can then have a machine learning model running to uh tell me where to move the map to not tell me to automate the control of the computer and that's what i would ultimately like to demonstrate and i do kind of want this to go away there we go um all right so let's let's look at the first steps and i i have working code that does this over here and i don't remember how to do it but um let's try to see if i can do it from the reference so first thing i need to do is make a robot object so i need to say robot equals new robot i'll do that in setup and let's run this code so here's a thing that will happen to you once you break out of processing and start using regular java it's like um sorry you there's there's a possible thing that could go wrong and you haven't told me what to do if that thing goes wrong i'm gonna need some more help here so and i really have to watch the time okay so processing usually will handle all sorts of errors for you behind the scenes and the way the library is written but often you have to be explicit so uh i'm gonna do a very sort of perfunctory job here and i can use a try catch statement and i can just catch any general exception uh in uh exception i'll call that e and i'm just gonna say print print line e and maybe i'll actually do a system.print.error so it'll show up in red is that not how you do it print line error i have no idea system.error printline i have no idea all right nevermind i don't know how to do that so i'm just going to say print line okay so not the best uh most comprehensive solution but um now i can run this sketch and i don't get an error the robot has been made so now the next thing i would like to do is let's look at what some of the functions are this moves the mouse mouse press this presses one or more of the buttons yeah and now mouse release i don't want this i want to know mouse wheel key press key release get pixel color get screen capture so you can do screen capture stuff with this so much you could do uh set auto delay delay wait for idle to string what am i missing here there's a thing that i'm doing to get the mouse points and i don't see it here um let's look at the methods wait for i i should have just been looking up here hmm instant no concrete let's look at my code since especially i'm out of time uh get number of buttons start robot robot track mouse oh yeah mouse oh it's um so this is actually just oh i don't even really need the robot for what i'm doing the robot is more to automate move stuff around maybe i need to i need mouse info because mouse info is a static class that can give me the pointer info okay interesting so actually what i'm looking for and i did java.awg.start so let's look at mouse info let's look at this so this is just for the data tracking java so i want to import this also and in let's just say let me just add a um an empty draw and let me add a mouse pressed so then i want to get in mouse info get pointer info and it's static so i want to say get pointer info and what does that give me back it gives me pointer info pointer info equals by the way welcome to the most longwinded esoteric programming language you could ever possibly use pointer info equals mouseinfo.getpointerinfo should be spelled with a zero i'm i'm imagining i guess i need uh import i mean i could just do dot star but i'm kind of curious to like figure out exactly what i'm using and then if i have a pointer info thingy i can look in this documentation and say get location which is a point and a point i'm assuming is also part of awt oh wait that's awt point how long till i just say awt star before i give up and say that so now uh print line point is i'm assuming there's just like an x in there and a y let's see yeah there we go now it's not registering it for other places but um i don't actually need to just get this i can but i can do this during draw now i should be able to say right as i move the mouse around anywhere on my desktop see how i'm getting the uh values there okay well that's that right so now this is what i'm going to do i am going to i'm going to show you kind of how i made this i am going to say a size so i'm going to do it i'm going to scale it down the same way i'm doing there so i'm going to make a variable called scale which i'm going to say let's do this all at a quarter scale and i also because i'm going to do some funny business with automating um the creation of the processing window itself system dot er dot print line system dot thank you system.org i didn't see that in the chat till just now so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to say if if you ever put variables into the size function and processing you need to move that into a function called settings otherwise you could just say size and setup so i'm going to say display width times scale display height times scale i guess i need to floor those because they have to be integers um okay so that should now if i run this right you can see it's the same i think i used using the same scale there then all i need to do is um let's put um background zero and then um i'm just going to say i'm going to do point previous i'm going to draw it as a line because that's what i'm doing up here previous equals point um and i will say if previous is not equal to null draw a line from point x point y to previous x previous y um and i need to multiply these by scale to scale it down and then stroke make it white so let's see i don't know if this is kind of work going to work but yeah so now as i move the mouse all around the larger window it's drawing the path scaled down and it doesn't matter like the processing window goes away it's doing this behind the scenes no matter what like here i'll put it away like i'm doing this doing this across the bottom scrolls girl scroll there you can see so that's a and the only thing that's different here is that i'm using some alpha so that it kind of builds up more over time just to be clear about this i could change this to you know 0.5 and now like you know i just scaled it down so this but the the thing that i really want to do is i want to save that data so i'm kind of running out of time so i think i would like to sort of like wrap up a bit um but i will just show you here um that in this particular example i've added a bunch of things but essentially i'm keep i made my own mousepoint class because i wanted to pair the time with the xy i'm not i don't know if i'm going to use the time but i thought uh i have it this is the only time i'll ever have the time i better save it and i'm not doing anything with clicks so um i want to i just create a mouse point which is in the x and y location along with the time and you can see this is ultimately the same thing like i have this p mouse and mouse objects and as long as um there i also like i skip it if it's like hasn't moved for a while maybe um and so just drawing that same thing with alpha the difference is um every 100 000 data points um i'm i basically i have this like arraylist history of all the mouse points and every time i track the mouse get that pointer info of the x and y and i didn't realize by the way i could just say point dot x point dot y and say get x and get y i make the new mouse point object with that x and y and the specific time stamp and then add it to that array that way in uh save data i just create a um i use the save strings function to essentially save x comma y comma time and if i go into um i save it as data mouse and then i also time stamp it as a csv file and you can see right now um the most recent one that i saved was at today at 11 45 a.m so it was 10 minutes ago if i actually click i think i force it to save if i click on it so now i just saved a new one at 11 58 and if i look at this in um where's my vs code um let me just open up visual studio code manually and i'm opening up a million digits of pi apparently if i open up i don't know where i saved this sketch robot demo no no no oh yeah it's in computer mouse mouse data collect this is this particular file from 11 58 am you can see it's just xy timestamp xy timestamp so i'm amassing all this data so i can make visualizations of it i've been working on a heat map visualization if anybody wants to help make some visualizations i'm happy to publish this data i could just stick it in a github repo again tweet me at shiffman is probably the best way or join the coding train discord um and ask one of the mods there um i can i can i just posted a link to the coding train discord in the chat hopefully i don't know if it if it popped up but maybe somebody's just the codingtrade.com discord um so i would love some sort of help i'm i'm like recording the video about all this stuff this weekend so you know if you want to make an interesting visualization i could maybe include it uh you know i don't want to i'm not i don't want to be taking advantage of them it's like generosity here so um but if it interests you i would welcome um any contributions um so what else do what i wanted to say about this um yeah let me before i go because it's noon and i need to wrap up i do really i haven't tested out what happened like some major issues i think i can't remember who it was somebody in the chat said watch out if you start writing software to take over your mouse how do you gain control back and actually now that i'm thinking about it oh well it's it's okay i've i've i'm gonna do all the things that i'm gonna do um i'm gonna work on my script um let's see let's go back to let's open here okay i can close this one let's go back to the robot class and i'm looking for mouse move move the mouse pointer to given screen coordinates okay let's see if i say uh x equals 100 y equals 100 then i'm going to in draw i'm going to um get rid of this tracking stuff for a second i'm going to say x plus equal random negative 100 100 y plus equal random negative 100 100 no no that's way too crazy 10 10 10 10 and then robot mouse move x y what could go wrong uh expect okay i need uh to convert these to integers this is a random a random mouse walk would like to control this computer using accessibility ah so i have to grant it control that's interesting uh let me just go over here just because i don't know what i'm revealing here allow the apps i'm gonna allow process what i'm just doing is i'm in the security and privacy um window and i'm clicking to allow processing control and we'll see if that does the trick i've already oh my god i have lost my mouse oh yeah it's doing it so i gave it control and you can see the mouse is up there in the corner stuck moving around can i hit escape okay good i can hit escape so let's go with um in setup i mean i would really like i should use one of my like steering behaviors examples or flocking behavior but let's do display with divided by two and display height divided by two let's make it uh move very very little and hopefully right now when i hit run it shouldn't just be in the center yeah there we go there's my mouse automate mood of moving [Laughter] this is like the least interesting um automate moving the mouse example that i could do let's um ah okay let's let's just because i want to have something slightly more interesting i could use perlin noise that actually would be a great one let's just do that let's just try purlin noise real quick um and then so this um x offset is zero y offset is zero and it's actually not really right so i'm not going to be using twodimensional noise it's fine just bear with me uh and now in draw float um x equals noise x x off times display with y equals noise y off display height and then i mean the x off just if you have no idea what i'm doing i would suggest my videos on pearl and noise let's see what happens now okay that's oh right right right right it's all on the diagonal because i need to look at different parts of the noise space here we go i have automated the movement of the mouse this is driving me crazy that there's this giant processing window that opens up um can i there's no no canvas but i can do size i think the minimum is probably this and i could alt tab now so i could go to the open like yeah there we go welcome to my automated mouse movie i never need to operate the computer again this is the end of today's live stream the grand finale so what i really would like to do is train a machine learning model to follow my mouse movements and then recreate them can i get some help with that we'll see how far i get but this does work and i can actually have it click also which is quite dangerous the good thing i'm doing right now is i'm not having a click so it just only is like pearl and noise random movements so now the question is how do i stop this if because i've hit escape i'm not in the processing ah and um abe is giving me a link to um people who have done kind of like auto clickers to beat various games and things there's so this could this could there's a really really quite far and i realized i was completely forgetting to use this mouse the whole time but look can i match it not really can i now i can use like servo motors in this so this moves automatically nice game for my cat says sav that's a great um a great um a great uh tip okay so um i'm done for today um thanks everybody for tuning in i hope this was interesting to you um i want to make sure i capture i i'm gonna have to like gain control back over my mouse oh what's actually really interesting is now i'm collecting oh my god stop stop stop everybody i love this hold on like you gain control over my mouse i can't get it back come on you can do it no there we go no not that one there this one escape okay this is what i'm gonna do now i just had the most wonderful idea i am going to run the data collection fresh and then move that up here and i know i've got a little bit this can come down it's going to be closed now let me run this code and now i'm collecting the data from the automated mouse moving yay because why not thank you oh i don't hear the sound anymore but i think i'm playing a very loud sound effect my headphone battery died okay it is 12 10 i have got to go my children have to be picked up from school at one o'clock um cannot the cat should be chasing the mouse there's so many metaphors here that i think could work thank you for tuning in i'm gonna put on some music get myself cleaned up here and out of here um i think maybe what i'll actually do though is just leave this running i'm going to oh wait i can you still use this mouse as my outro screen i'm just going to take away my camera so i'm gone now um and um i am going to put on some music and uh leave this running and i will see you all uh next hopefully next friday i'm trying to do live streams on friday for the next um foreseeable future and um please come and join um check out the computer mouse conference um someone could post a link to the computer mouse conference in the chat um there's i think there's probably ways you could participate or still watch the conference i'm not entirely sure but um yeah okay here we go back to uh my music and there we go as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop muting my mic but i'm still here i'm reading your chat messages this dot song never forget the this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward cartesian songs autotune and the internet will fix that for me take it with me coordinate song unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids kids the kittens the kids and kittens and kittens the kittens and kittens the kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens of dastada
