good morning I think I am live do you hear me do you hear the soft sounds of the ukulele in the background I'm wondering because when I tested oh no you're not hearing the ukulele oh definitely not okay now I know what's wrong my voice is coming through but hold on I will fix this this is very important this is quite possibly the most important thing of the day and here we go Oh I know you're just hearing it through my mic sorry I should have fixed this before I started this is terrible somebody eventually when this gets published put in the cup pinned I'll put a pin comment for the time code where this actually starts we just see something here no way here we go no no yes okay there we go monitor through the output device I just start this over hold on gonna hit stop and fix this people can't hear me either hold on voice alright hold on I'm timeout I'm stopping this oh you hear me okay like half asleep but I starts this live stream we can hear me okay okay but all I just want to fix this sound thing there we go I fixed it just forget how to do this okay let's start over hello good morning welcome to the coding train with me Daniel Schiffman so I'm a little bit halfasleep today I don't usually stream in the morning it's not even really the morning frankly it's 1040 I've been awake for like at least like four and a half hours I get up very early but it's been a very long week I probably should like stream on Monday not that my weekends are so restful but I'm excited to be here I am ready I've got like a scratchy throat like a cold kind of it's getting close like chilly in New York it's like it was like the summer then it was sort of the fall for like one day it's interacting so but I'm excited to be here and do some coding stuff I want to see if I have anything to cover here Simon is asking if I saw his suggestion yes Simon has given an excellent suggestion for octahedra which is a cube with faces connected up I would definitely like to get to that at some point but I don't know if I'll get to that today I am I'm excited to premiere something wait a second I have to wait till I get a message like I have to create the fake scenario for the thing that I want to premiere wait a second breaking those news breaking news this is not going well how do I turn my brain on there's got to be a way to turn my brain on you know what I think is a way to turn my brain on coding let's just get started so one of the things that I want to do today and let me let me go to sevensegment display actually you know what let's let's take a moment here and go to the coding train website you know what I think the website might be broken cuz it's supposed to show I think a note here when I'm livestreaming it's the most recent livestream that it's showing is for March 14th so Oktoberfest don't want to help fix this on the website that would be a good thing to fix but I want to come here for a second ok so I recently did a coding challenge 7 segment display and look at this this has been really successful in my view in the sense that it inspired a lot of creative possibilities one that I really want to look at shoot can I just do a search on Twitter without logging in maybe I can log in as the coding train yep that was an easy way to do it and there we go this is actually what I'm looking for I love this from Sebastian vane out 7segment display combined with p5.js and matter digest many here um let's click on let's actually click on all of them why not let's just look through all of them really quickly alright so we've got this one we've got time maybe I don't know cool I love that okay so this is wonderful because this is exactly what Tom Scott talked about in his video about 7segment display looking up and using a regular expression to figure out what is the longest word you can display on a seven segment display we've got super trance and then dole maybe and so we can choose the color of the display that's a really nice feature and I really should be crediting the people here so I probably should click on them one at a time here this is from Tom Seeley source code here thank you Tom Seeley this is one from BL for score and look at this oh wait I'm in the wrong page this is nice it's interactive this is relates to something that I want to do today we've got another clock from weimar shippers I love this oh look at this and guess what this is actually a new feature of the p5.js web editor now when you share your sketch with the full URL it you get a little like bar on the top that has the p5 logo the name of your sketch and a credit so by Willie Waring you can still get a view actually so let's see if we can do this well if you go to file share full screen there is still a full view without it which is would be in bed so if we go here and I switch to embed there's still a full view without the the p5 information all right so now we also have another clock from swifty turtle excellent name this is lovely great work we have a seven segment display from Tony Stark hey Tony Stark thanks for contributing to the coding train look at this with all the segments to find the binary stuff defined I don't know this is a let's see if we can read a bit more about what this is from prasad pandit a decoder app so this is a maybe an app that's helping you figure out the encoding and decoding of the binary stuff the binary numbers and how those represented on the 7segment display itself we've got a processing 7segment display so I should really just to be a good person let's let's actually run this code this is the one thing that's a little bit tricky it's a little bit harder oh this is just actually a raw port so I don't actually know need to run this this looks like it's just raw port thank you for that and then we've got the objectoriented refactoring so this let's take a look at this because I have to say I take this as a badge of honor but most people are very nice to me in the comments but I get a lot of the the negative comments that I get which I don't necessarily you is negative are your code is terrible it's messy it's disorganized you should you're teaching your variable names are bad you should be teaching good code practices and fair criticism guilty as charged but one of the things that I like to emphasize and that's part of my process which I recognize maybe isn't for everybody is that messiness is part of playful experimentation now you're right software development requires care and time and thoughtful engineering commenting code organizing code these are valuable and important skills but sometimes you want to play around make up an idea and I also view it as a prompt to the viewer to think about what I've done with my code and make and change it to work for you and that could mean organize it but I do aspire to you know teach good practice and also use good practices myself on this channel so we'll see maybe I'll maybe I'll get better point taken all right so let's look at this one though I really want to look at the code for this one so one of the things I can probably do actually I think if I just click here in this new view it will take me to the page with the code and we can see look at this we've got a segment class an off collar on off color and on color a length and a width and a state so this is really nice and look how nicely documented this is so this is a sort of format for selfdocumenting code comments which will can be generated into a documentation page display the segment set on set off this is lovely now let's see if we look here when we see there's even now a 7 segment display class which has a set of segments in them it initializes them it has the hex codes look at this this is a really excellent work this is excellent work who did this brew Alves I know thank you so much so all of you who are looking for a more thoughtful refactoring and reorganization of my quick and dirty seven second display this is a great one to look at and you can see now the main program is just making new seven segments but look at this let's see if we can even figure out to make two of these like how hard would it be now if I say let's make two of them or me so I'm gonna say create canvas six hundred four hundred now this of course should use an array but let's just say I want to put two next to each other and I make two of them and I want to display a digit update you know these are counting and maybe I want to also display a digit and maybe I'll say like 10 minus index or something now what's going on here I don't actually see two of them so this is where I might offer an idea for improvement which is that the the offset vector is hardcoded here so what if I were able to give it an X and a Y then I could add the X and y here then under in sketch I could say let's have one at like zero zero comma zero and let's have one at 100 comma zero now interestingly I've still not seen two of them let's see like right why don't I see two of them well let's take a look at how it's drawing the offset vector whoops in 7segment display this is like kind of a private variable here but it must be used somewhere where is it used somewhere in maybe like a draw function right transform oh look at this top oh there's all these trance whoa this is crazy kind of unbelievable Wow generate display okay okay here's what we need we need a push here and a pop here that's my guess because my guess is that the generate display function is not selfcontained so all of these translations that happen here are affecting other ones do transformations this seems reasonable now why aren't I still seeing two of them one two all right so let's see here zero let's see let's try to figure out what's going on we have to debug this a bit more let's change the on color huh so weird why why are my changes not taking effect on color stroke on color off color hmm interesting let's go back to just 400 by foreigners bothering me that it's off the and now let's do 100 so we've moved this both of them over so also interestingly oh you know what aha where is the background being drawn let's I think there's also an issue with this which is a problem which is that the background is being drawn here in update so this is a problem because in when the way I think about objectoriented programming is that I only want the object to know about and do things that are part of that object itself and background is not part of the object background is part of the world so this really needs to come out and be here in draw and look at this now now we have successfully you know maybe made two of them whoops so now we've got two of them so that's good I've got two seven segment displays why did my change of the color not actually take effect it's a little bit weird and it's not a super important detail but I'm curious oh because there's a set and a set on color so somewhere else the color is being set and so presumably that's happening here it's actually here so it's interesting like this is a bit I mean it's nice that that's there but the color is actually being set in the display itself so for example if I were to change this now we're going to see we're going to see it now blue okay so anyway I'd sorry I got went off on a bit of a tangent here looking at this project I'm gonna save this as well one thing that it would be nice if the p5 editor could keep track of where this came from but I'm gonna I'm gonna do that myself this was from object ordinary fracturing so let's buy Bru all so let's a credit brew all and over here so if anyone wants to take a look at this revised from brew all which is here and also let's credit this github page alright so this is the thing this is really this is that here's an important tidbit that I believe in with all of my heart and soul and if I ever make a mistake in this realm please let me know open source is a thing and I encourage my students for example to use open source code examples in the creation of a project and whatever the license might be right you might find a license like open source licensing is a big top unto itself that would be lovely to discuss in depth some opensource licenses require attribution some have restrictions on what you can use the code for whether commercial or noncommercial purposes some require share back like if you make a change you have to share that change back but some opensource licenses notably like the MIT license and the BSD license are very permissive meaning yeah I don't I make no warranties with this code whatsoever and you do what you like anything goes however I feel that it is good practice to no matter the license credit your sources so there are some situations where that's certainly required but even if it's not required I wouldn't want to build on top of somebody else's code to educational material even if it's open sourced without crediting it back so that's something that I always try to remember to do and I would encourage you as you make projects to always credit back all right so I will this will get hopefully left somewhere in the video's description maybe somebody who has privileges can share this in the in the chat right now actually one thing that I wanted to also mention housekeeping wise is there have been some recent improvements to the coding train website which is pretty much a community project I I do would like to apologize that there are a lot of open poll requests and issues I really need to do a better job of maintaining this community project and I'm hoping to figure out ways in the future to get more people involved in that maintenance but one of the new things that happened recently I'm gonna go under pull requests and closed is look for this web editor it might be further down here let's look for this web yes add web editor to video page so this is a feature that adds an option to include a link to a coding challenge our tutorial with the web editor so if I look at any web page for example this 7segment display one let's come back to this here you can find weird oh is it broken hey where are the buttons there should be like buttons to like download what if we broke something oh I did 10 in Dec people are wait hold on I'm getting a note from the chat 10 index is causing a bit of a problem with this which is that 10 minus 0 is 10 and I want to go from 9 down to zero so this should really be 10 minus index minus 1 that should do the trick right 3 2 1 not yeah there we go okay thank you for that back to what I was saying weird where did it go let's go to a different challenge like for example let's go do coding challenges and let's go to like that this one also let's go to here okay so this one is hasn't it I don't know why it wasn't showing up and now there's two rows of buttons which is weird some stuff got messed up hey people feel free to file github issues and pull requests but so what's supposed to happen here is that there is a link to view the code which if I click here will take me to the github page that has the actual code there is a link to download the code which if I click that will just trigger an automatic download of the code as a zip file this is processing then there's live example now live example this is not active live example should point to the p5.js version that runs in the browser and I'm not sure why there isn't one for the Lisa G occur delecia Shuker curve table but there's also this oh and look at this this now view code points to the p5.js web editor one right which was the new feature and this one points to the web editor live version look at that so I got to clean this up figure out what should be here and what shouldn't probably this should be if I'm thinking about it view code is always nice to go to some github repo download code is nice to have right so this gives you a zipped and then I would say the live example should probably go to the p5.js web editor if it's there or or github pages URL if there's no p5.js web editor or then nothing it's deactivated if there is no live example so and so this might be processing or you know or a p5 this would also be processing or p5 but this live example would always be p5 so this is the implementation well you can screenshot this and file this as a github issue and then what I could use help with actually is going back and all the old challenges that don't have a p5 web editor version of them actually creating them now here's the thing in order for you to do this though I need to give you access to the coding train p5 web editor account because I think it would be nice for this to show up under the under the coding train account I mean that's what I'm thinking so you might have to get in touch maybe somebody who's in the patron group or the slack channel can help with that specifically ok don't tell me it's like okay it's only 11 all right I'm really slow getting started today so let me talk about what's on the horizon here let me I should sign in maybe there's I don't know should probably sign in as myself when I look at the YouTube page but let me just see here is that playlist public yet so a couple things let me mention if you hadn't noticed my friend Cal Akana also because I have YouTube premium okay no thanks I'm good okay sorry sorry for that digression there with an ad so recently the video tutorial with Nabil has same for all was published this was this is an edited version of a live stream so if you are interested in learning how to train a long shortterm memory network with tensorflow and then running that in the browser this came out I also wanted to just alert you to some a text that Nabil added to the description related to taking about data and ethics and responsibility so I encourage you to read through this description here so I want to note that that was published now what I'm also looking for tonight welcome to let's see created playlist I think it's not a public playlist yet let me look over here and see if I can switch that give me a second people are telling me to install adblocker okay what is let me look at this playlists might as well make this a public playlist if people want to get started looking at this stuff and at playlist I think this is where I would do this unlisted edit how do you change iya public okay let's make this public right now okay so now if i refresh this i haven't released these videos yet I'm still working on the captions and various elements but if I go here I there is now session 12 I have released session 12 word Tyvek with three video tutorials these are edited from last week's livestream so if you want to get started looking at this stuff I'm gonna hopefully continue my discussion of word Tyvek today alright alright now it's time to have some fun one of the things that and I know that's a black screen right now I will fix that in a second one of the things that I did with the 7segment display is in the 7segment display I picked up hexadecimal numbers this releaser this is a paper towel where's my nice eraser I picked up hexadecimal numbers from the from the Wikipedia page about 7 segment display and I converted those hexadecimal numbers into binary sort of and did bit shifting and bit and asking on them and I kind of glossed over and a hand waved the explanation of bit shifting and bit masking and one of the comments I got was I didn't understand the bits part so what I'm gonna do today is you know I thought like oh let me just do like a 1 minute binary numbers tutorial I think those kinds of things exist on YouTube already and probably are better than what I could do you know because they're explainer videos with animation and sort of thoughtful diagramming and so what I thought that I would do is do two coding challenges around binary numbers today and I would basically make an interactive display to convert from binary numbers to decimal numbers and back and then I would sort of explain what binary numbers are and then also look at bit shifting and bit masking as part of this so I don't that's exactly the entire plan that I have I didn't try coding any of this in advance so this is what I'm going to do and I think that doing this in the web editor will be fine there's definitely some complicated aspects of this let me close all these windows let me save this there's an issue by the way a current open issue with the p5 web editor is that if you rename a sketch and even if you saved it it really thinks that you didn't save it but how I'm used to go ahead I'm used to that okay so binary numbers base two and bits and bytes okay let me get the chat open here to make sure I haven't missed anything and welcome new member breaking news this is another breaking news let me credit these people who made these breaking news things Tristan thank you Tristan new member who made this wonderful let me find who made these breaking news things so Nick thank you soundcloud.com slash Nick ramstad slash Schiffman breaking news Nick Ramsay made this money and then there's another one I have to find it let's see let's see let me find this under community which video is this breaking news oh no don't I just search breaking news on github by accident I mean uh I'm looking at my youtube comments not on github okay Zach Solomon on live stream number live stream number internet is so slow won't even tell me which number it is live stream number 156 let's see if this comes up live stream videos live stream 156 meet the Landers the revolutionary who's standing is from under featuring the latest in hightech advancements the Landers set up in just minutes and come with us thank you very much all right where where are you Zach Salomon there was a comment here about breaking news let's get that ad fine is it show up here SoundCloud soundcloud.com solo mozz slash coating train breaking news oh it's gone here we go so this one thank you to Zach I'm here for all of your coding trade breaking news that other sound effects that I can use throughout the livestreams alright sorry for that digression I am getting myself ready for the coding challenge beginning of today okay alright hello my live talking yes going train this coding challenge is brought to you by water I have water today and I didn't last time my throat is killing me after my livestream okay I should really say water I drink it and then I have to go pee which is what I feel like I have to do right now but I'm going to do this coding challenge nonetheless hahee dino asks can i code my data structures homework in p5 I would love to know if that's Bobby certainly you can do data structures in p5 which is just a library for JavaScript and you can create data structures in JavaScript and visualize them with p5 but I don't know what your homework is exactly so if your homework is create a linked list in C++ then doing it in p5 won't do you a lot of good but I have some videos where I do different data structure stuff in JavaScript and maybe that will help you alright let's begin hello welcome to a coding challenge binary numbers alright so uh oh wait wait hold on I want to reference the 7segment display Schiffman coding train this really should come up there we go this is making me crazy yeah okay hello welcome to a coding challenge now I recently did a coding challenge number 117 about the 7segment display and there was weird code in there like this like Val greater than greater than shift ampersand 1 oh my goodness what is this I did something called bitwise operations this is actually a bit shifting and bit masking and let me tell you I did not explain it well at all in the video if I scroll down a look at the comments so many of the comments were I did not understand that pitch shifting stuff so I've decided to do two coding challenges the first one I'm doing right now about binary numbers so if you don't even know what binary numbers are you're in the right place if you want to kind of think about maybe a creative project you might make around binary numbers like a clock that is the time is displayed in binary they're also in the right place I am going to try to in this coding challenge make a what am i doing I can I just start over this is my one mole again which I say every time now the coding starts okay okay come on energy energy hello welcome to a coding challenge about binary numbers now I previously did a coding challenge number 117 about the 7segment display as displayed right there and I had some weird code in it like Val greater than greater than shift ampersand 1 what that is that well this is a bit shifting operation and this is a bit masking operation and I sort of explained it but not really in that video in fact I explained it rather terribly kind of glossing over it and I got a ton of comment about a few comments the ratio of the percentage of comments don't go up with all these tangents editing is a thing editing is a thing last time last time I think I have to I'm gonna make it through this I just gotta get going it's really tortures to live viewers that the chat will be full of rage again wow so many read I don't usually do this many retakes but today just happening okay previous one was better oh it's the fake energy and enthusiasm oh my goodness alright real energy this is authentic energy and enthusiasm I am genuinely excited to talk about binary numbers and don't hello and welcome to a codec challenge this coding challenge is a coding challenge about binary numbers okay why am I doing this well previously I did a coding challenge called the 7segment display where I made the 7segment display in an orange make it I did these weird operations with this greater than greater than and this ampersand and these operations are known as bit shifting and bit masking I really did not explain those concepts well or even at all in that challenge and I got a bunch of comments saying I didn't understand the whole bits part so let me go backwards here in time travel back in time or forward or whatever because you could I'm just gonna do a video which explains binary numbers I'm gonna do to two challenges one to just explain binary numbers and two to actually explain bit shifting a bit masking so first but I need to make these a coding challenge so what I'll actually do let me try it I think what might make sense is to build a little visualization system where if I type in a number a decimal number a regular number I'll talk about what a decimal number is in a second then I see it in binary and maybe I can click on the binary number and change the bits and then have it converted back into decimal that's what I'm gonna try to do so okay so if you've never heard about binary numbers welcome I am going to attempt to explain right now so first of all before I even explained binary numbers we've got to understand this concept of a base the base a number a number system like a base 10 or a base 16 or a base 64 or base 2 number system the base refers to the number of possibilities of digits that you can use to encode a particular number it could be more than digits if we get beyond 10 for example so we talk base 10 with our 10 fingers and 10 toes is the way we traditionally think about numbers 10 or deca Dec and that's why we call this decimal numbers so base 10 is decimal numbers there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 I counted that wrong 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 digits when we get up to 9 right we're counting up to 9 the next one we have to go back to zero and then add an extra spot then go to 11 and I'm going off the off the lot now we could have base to base 2 is binary 2 possibilities by 0 1 1 0 1 1 this is me counting and binary 1 0 0 right because I only have and I could sort of add the zeros here I only have two possible digits for each spot in my numbering system so this is binary now other wellknown encoding systems like base 16 or hexadecimal allow for well now for 16 and well how can we have more than 10 well in hexadecimal when you get after 9 yet the letter A then B then C then D then e then F so you've got 16 possible digits that's why if you see something like this FF this is a hexadecimal number I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking okay so the reason why this is important in computing is that computers actually store everything in memory as in binary a single spot for a single binary number is called a bit so we could say that if I were to sort of imagine the computer's memory as a sequence of slots each slot can have a 0 or a 1 in them 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 now 8 bits is referred to as a byte so when you hear somebody say this file takes takes up like 3,000 kilobytes well a kilobyte is a certain amount of bytes with a certain amount of bits let's talk about how many spots in the computer's memory or is required to store this information so I'm taking a break for a second I'm looking at the chat I kind of want to start over again all right so you might have noticed when you were learning programming or p5 or different things that like why there's so many situations where there are 256 possibilities right the red 4 if you're going to set the color of a shape you're gonna draw the range is between 0 and 255 which is actually 256 possibilities where interestingly enough right what is the binary representation of 256 it is if I just come back here and create another set of slots 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 all the bits being on in an in a single byte is 256 counting from 0 to 255 it's actually 255 excuse me but it's the 256 possibility counting from 0 to 255 is something you can do within a single byte this is why many systems are optimized to work with powers of 2 2 4 8 16 32 this is native to how the computer stores information so that 7 segment display that looked like this it was designed to have 8 possible options because it can be the how the display is shown rendered can be configured in a single byte right is this spot a 0 or a 1 that means that maybe this is either on or off what about this one on or off now it's weird that it's called 7segment because why isn't it an eight segment display every eight segments well that's because it also has an extra seven segments but an extra spot for the decimal point okay so that's some background on binary numbers alright so the next thing I'm gonna do edit this part out is write an algorithm okay all right okay I've got an idea here so let's go back over to the computer for a second because actually JavaScript itself if I just like open up a console here in the browser has functions in it to convert between a decimal numbers and binary numbers what is the decimal representation of this binary number for example what is the binary representation of this decimal number for what server that's really what I'm doing in this coding challenge I want to write an algorithm that can convert back and forth now you don't need to do this in JavaScript because JavaScript will do this for you so for example if I were to if I were to have a binary number I'm gonna call it num equal and I'm gonna put it in quotes like as a string what was that number it was zero one zero one one zero one zero I can use the JavaScript builtin function parse int give it that number and I must explain what base is that number in and that is and it's going to give me the decimal equivalent ninety so remember I said how remember how I said FF is a number in hexadecimal well I can now say parse int num in base 16 255 write FF is 255 and by the way let's actually let's say parse int 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 that's also 255 so the parse int function will take the string Lee text representation of any number at any base and convert it to decimal as long as you give it the second argument base which is also sometimes referred to as radix so you pronounce that I don't know now what if you want to go the other way around like what if I have the number 255 and I want to get that exactly it's telling me here what if I want to get that what if I want to get that number in in its binary representation well the two string method will do that and I can actually give that a base array so if I say 255 to string actually I just say to string it's actually gonna give me an error because it's like you can't call a function on a primitive value like a number nut luckily if I put that in a variable I could say num to string whoops num to string and I get the string 255 and now if I were to say num to string base I get the binary representation so and I can also I could do this by the way I think if I put it in parenthesis or something like that I will get that so now we've seen how JavaScript can do all this for you automatically now's the time for me finally to write some code I could just use that but I'm gonna be I feel like writing my I feel like learning about how this binary stuff works in a slightly more deep way so I'm gonna write my own algorithms to convert back and forth and I'm also gonna create a visual system to make that interactive pause for a second and of course the chat is talking about whether a thousand bits is a kilobyte or a thousand 24 bits is a kilobyte and that's why I didn't actually say it either way let me get that I lost the chat here Oh dot dot what does the dot dot mean alka ah XOR thank you Simon is also maybe it's not breaking news breaking news from the chat where's the company from it's a decimal followed by a dot oh how weird that's the weirdest thing I have ever seen why does that work so that works that's so weird okay octal yeah all I wanted to mention that you can make up any all right okay where's my eraser okay all right so let's look at how this works first of all I'm a you know this what I'm doing in this video is it's just working worrying about binary numbers and decimal numbers but it would be interesting to create your own as a challenge to you after you watch this or just go do it right now write a function that takes two numbers in in any arbitrary base and our one number in any arbitrary base and can convert it to any other arbitrary base because even though I talked about decimal or hexadecimal or binary we could just make up a we could say base five or base three like base three would be 0 1 2 3 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 this is so hard to do to 0 to 1 right that's base I space for not phase 3 this is base 4 because there's four possible combination digits combinations ok so but what I want to do here is if we're in binary the easiest the easy way to start is to the easy way to start is to look at converting between binary and decimal to decimal will also do decimal to binary but let's start with binary to decimal ok so 0 I'm just going to make a little table manually is 0 1 is 1 1 0 is 2 1 1 is 3 1 0 0 then is 4 you notice something here we've got what's important here is we've got zero well sir hold on it's a little bit confusing here the way yeah yes sorry what's important here is what's important here is this 1 this 2 and this 4 look at the pattern here 1 is a 1 1 0 is a 2 1 0 0 is a 4 can you guess what 1 0 0 0 is going to be now guess what it's 8 each bit represents the amount in decimal yep each sorry each bit represents a power of 2 this is 2 to the 0 that's 2 to the 1 that's 2 to the 2 2 squared this is 2 to the 3 so what we can actually do to convert from binary to decimal is use this pattern here is this is this first binary digit a 0 or a 1 so hold on I shouldn't plan this out shouldn't practice this let's go back to that number I think it was 90 oh boy I think it was this I don't know it wasn't I think it was this so this is the way we could do it basically each one of these spots this is 2 to the 0 this is 2 to the 1 that's 2 to the 2 that's 2 to the 3 that's 2 to the 4 heads 2 to the 5 this is 2 to the 6 this is 2 to the 7 right so now 0 times this is 0 1 times this is 2 0 times this is 0 1 times this is 8 1 times this is 16 we got a 0 here what's what's 8 16 32 this is 60 four and then this is zero so now I can add all this up 64 plus 16 plus 8 plus 2 we've got 20 carry the 2 990 look at this we have now converted between binary representation and decimal whoo okay let's go now and write the code to actually do this and also let's visualize it alright so let's start with just a number which equals zero one zero one one zero one zero okay and now we're gonna write a function called binary to decimal a decimal and it's going to take a value and what I need to do is just loop over all the digits and again there's all sorts of fancy ways we could probably lose in one line of code with a higher order function and but we're gonna do this in the long winded way to really understand it I equals 0 I is less than Val dot length I plus plus now actually here's the thing if my death binary number is a string I actually want to start at this digit first all right because I want I don't think this could be any given length but I wanna you know I want to add things starting counting at zero so what I might do here is actually say now the index equals value dot length minus I minus 1 right so let's say there's eight of them I went when I is zero I want to look at the 7th when I is one I want to look at the six when I is 2 I'm going to look at the fifth so we've got this now all I need to say is let me get the bit is a value car at I sorry car at index I want to get that is it a zero or one and I also need to turn it into a number I'm just gonna use parse int for that which by default will turn it into a zero or 1 in decimal without any and then I'm going to say and I need a sum sum equals zero then I'm going to say sum plus equal power 2 to the 8th power times bit so I'm basically doing exactly this I am saying for when I is zero go to this bit which is the last character in the string and then multiply it by x 2 to the ice power oh shoot then multiply it by 2 to the 8th power okay then when that's all done I'm going to return some all right now so we could test this idea out like I could just say now a console.log binary to decimal none and look we've got 90 down here this is like a 45minute video so far where all I did was convert one number two but anyway we're getting somewhere now what I want to do that took me a half an hour since I started how am I making how is it possible that I'm making a coding challenge and it's like hours long okay let's now visualize this binary number so I'm gonna say let's let's make a canvas that's like four hundred by 100 I'm gonna say background 255 and I'm gonna say I four let a equal zero eyes listen um dot length I plus plus and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to say the width of the the width of each I'm gonna draw a rectangle for each bit and the width the the size of each rectangle is with / numb not length and then so I want to draw I'm going to say fill zero rectangle I times W 0 W height so I want to draw a bunch of rectangles and let's say stroke 255 just so I put something around it and we'll say it's size is minus 1 and minus 1 so minus 1 so there you go so I now have this visualization of all the bits and I'm going to say the fill is numb car at I times 255 there we go and then let's make the stroke like a grey so it shows up kind of no matter what so again boy my design skills and let's say a stroke wait for I really have terrible design skills oh this is awful but you see the idea it's like thicker here and oh wow I don't like so this is the idea that I am now and then I want to say and I'm gonna say no loop here create P create P binary to decimal numb there we go Owen let's okay it's fine so we can see here this is what I've got so I'm gonna NGO you can't buy hold on just timeout for a second I'm thinking I'm just going to very briefly add something to style dot CSS so because I want the font color to be white what is that text color that was just color font color no color oh that what 255 is not anything I'm just gonna oil it just so that this is a bit more legible I am going to very briefly just edit the CSS here and I think I can add color and then by the way I need to do this in hexadecimal ffffff shouldn't that be white now do I not have enough EPS there we go I am going to say size text size font size it must be font size 64 point there we go so now now I can see here so now any binary number I put in here I will get the decimal representation I'm converting it and I'm visualizing it so now you the viewer of this because kody challenge is complete it's kind of a very sad result but I am very excited for you to do something better with this so for example I would love to add the feature where I like to do is click on these and I can switch the bits so that would be great try that what if you know there's probably some nice or more visually pleasing way maybe I want to put text um you know I oh I need to add something to this I want to make this content editable so I could actually edit this let me just show you so what I could do here is and let's let's put this let's make let's just make it a div and I'm gonna say create div just so it shows up without all right here and now I'm gonna say um I'm gonna say I'm just gonna add this for you div equals creative div dot attribute attribute I think it's the p5 way of doing this content editable and I'll just say true so I'm adding a HTML attribute to this div which makes it content editable so now what if I edit that I want to update the bits so I have to convert the other way I guess I could do that in another video maybe I'm done right now pause that stop this silliness of watching me and go go to the URL that's in the video's description to take a look at this sketch and make your own beautiful interactive version of this with ways that I couldn't possibly imagine right now alright thanks for watching and see you soon I was terrible I almost want to do the whole thing over again I'm looking at the chat the over give me interesting suggestions zero to zero isn't you can use binary literals in JavaScript that as well yes I didn't mean for this to be a coding challenge I meant to just sort of like extra explain take two it's like how long do you think mean I don't know I don't know I guess I should move on okay just now I'm realizing I'm coding this maybe doesn't make sense as a coding challenge maybe it's really like a tutorial series because it could be multipart like I can make it do it over again what are you doing next asks Nasir make the rectangles draggable like I mean there's so many things I would like to that I meant to sort of like do here hold on I'm thinking I don't write I know yes but I felt like so Alessandra makes a very good comment in the chat which is the thing is this didn't really explain the bit operations in the 7segment video yes that's definitely what I was going to do next because not once I have a visual system I can start to add like shifting to it like what if I press the right arrow and shift everything over I sort of feel like I'm just torn as to what to do here I kind of want to just do that whole thing over again there's like a second take now that I kind of understand what it is I'm doing because I can probably be much less longwinded about it let me at least erase over here I don't know if that will it was ultimately these live streams are not what the larger YouTube audience watches the larger YouTube audience watches the edited versions of these I'm out of time I'm thinking about redoing this over the color should be the other way around yeah they definitely should be no I guess so I don't know let's guess I could use Dom elements click on them I want to do this one more time I'm gonna do this one more time because I won't be able to live with myself if I don't so I apologize to everybody okay all right I'm I guess I'm just gonna make a new sketch yeah here we go okay okay all right everyone the the IR irony here is that I don't have very much time and I'm gonna end up just doing only the binary stuff today which I actually don't really mind so much all right everybody so all of you watching live should just go on with your day now go do something else make yourself a cup of tea go watch a different youtube videos play a game of chess we'll go outside if it's a nice day outside where you are may have something to eat let's go do something else because I am literally going to do exactly what I just did just just just just to see what happens just I'm just damn curious for this experiment if actually I produce better content doing something twice or whether the spontaneousness of the first time is actually better we'll find out won't we okay oh no I'm in the wrong place here we go okay so this is the thing maybe this doesn't make sense as a coding challenge I think I was just thinking coding challenge because that's what but all right all right we're gonna do it is the coding challenge it's fine and then we'll do addendum it's part multipart cuz why not or it'll be long it's gonna be long that's fine all right I just have to know that it's gonna be long at the beginning hello and welcome to what will undoubtedly be the longest video you've ever watched my binary numbers so why am I making this challenge here so I made a coding challenge number 117 called the 7segment display and what I was doing was creating a visual JavaScript HTML canvas version of a 7segment display and to do that I had some weird code in there Val greater than greater than shift ampersand 1 and that code but code right up there made no sense to anybody and I tried to explain it but I got a lot of comments saying I didn't get what this was so this is a bit shifting and bit masking so before I can even get into that I thought let's take a deep breath and let's just enjoy and go back backwards in time days of yore when we didn't have anything but binary numbers and we had to program everything in binary I don't know that this never happened for me but I can imagine there was a time where this really happened so this is a coding challenge where I will explain what binary numbers are and then I will create a sketch p5.js sketch in JavaScript that converts a binary number to a decimal number okay so maybe you're even asking right now what is a binary number what is a decimal number so before I can even answer that we have to talk about this idea of base base is is a term that refers to the number of possibilities in a counting system in a number system so base 2 or binary there are only two possibilities a 0 or a 1 base 10 10 Dec deca or decimal has 10 possibilities 0 through 9 there are other wellknown numbering systems that get used often probably the one you see in computing the most is base 16 or hexadecimal and this actually has 16 possible digits 0 through 9 and also A through F so when you see something like this in CSS like FF 0 0 FF this is hexadecimal encoding this FF in decimal is 255 this 0 0 in decimal is 0 this FF is 255 so this is the color this is a representation of the color red of to 5500 of green and blue 255 so anyway so this kind of encoding of information exists and by the way in my 7 segment display there were hexadecimal representations of what should be displayed on the 7segment display okay so hexadecimal is interesting I'm not gonna do hexadecimal conversion in this video but you know it's important to realize like these are maybe something that you see I think like base 8 is used for like some file systems but um you can make up anything like if you have base for you just have four possibilities maybe 0 1 2 or 3 and when I say possibilities it it this defines how you count and by the way this historically there are all sorts of alternative ways of counting I believe I was looking and the Aztecs used maybe units of like 0 then 20 then 40 then 800 then 8000 there's like these were the idea and those were instead of digits there were actually like drawings of what so anyway so you look that up somebody will make a nice explained our YouTube video about systems but if we have base 2 this means there are only two possibilities so like let's let's use base ten decimal because we understand that ten fingers ten toes that's why base ten is the convention 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 right because once we get to 9 we've run out of possibilities in a single digit so we switch to 0 and then the next digit over the tens unit becomes a 1 this is what kids learn in elementary school in counting in groups of 10 hundreds units etc alright so but if I were doing this in binary I would say 0 then I would say 1 and then I have run out of digits so I have to say 1 0 and then 1 1 and then a 1 0 0 then 1 0 1 1 1 1 I'm totally like this is the worst drawing ever and then 1 0 0 0 did I get that right no I totally did not 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 then 1 1 1 and then 1 0 0 0 oh this is hard ok let me match up some things for you so something that's really interesting here is 1 matches up with 1 1 0 matches up with 2 1 0 0 matches up with four five six seven one zero zero zero zero matches up with eight notice that when there is only the leading digit one and everything else is a zero there's a pattern here 1 2 4 8 maybe now you could imagine what 1 0 0 0 0 is going to be how about 16 whoops sorry 16 I should put that over here 1 2 4 8 16 these numbers are doubling so in fact each one of these digits in binary represents not the tens the twos so with a one this is actually one this is actually 2 to the 0 power 2 this is 2 to the 1 power this is 2 squared 2 to the third power we're doubling so this is by the way the algorithm that I need to write in my code to convert from binary representation to decimal representation are you ready to do that okay um I don't know maybe that was better so far so I'm going to show the thing in JavaScript where you can actually it'll do this for you all right all right so actually before I write my own algorithm I should point out that this is the kind of thing that you can actually do in JavaScript so first of all I think you can make a number like if you say 0b like if you put like the 0 then the B it's like oh now this numbers gonna be in binary so like if I say like 1 0 that should be no oh whoops sorry actually it is right hold on let me come back here refresh this page oh god I have to watch this crazy ad again okay all right happy give an 8 now we come back alright so one thing I want to show you first is you can actually you you don't need to write your own algorithm do this conversion this is built into the way that computers work and actually javascript has several helpful front help helper functions that'll do this for you I think if I say for example a equals zero B if I have a variable that's equal zero B I can put any encoding so like what if I put 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 actually the value of that's actually 255 so this is I can actually hard code a number in binary by saying 0 B I can also use this parse int function so if I say parse int and give it a string like 255 just converts it this string to a number but I can do things like say parse int 1 1 0 and then give it a radix sort this is another word for bass and say like what is the value of the integer value the decimal integer value of 1 1 0 in base 2 right it's 6 in base if it were base 10 obviously it's honored and 10 so this is that this will actually be done for you just threw that parse int function but let's go and actually write our own algorithm for this yes there is a bell ringing and let's go to the web editor so let's let's just assume for the sake of argument that the binary numbers that I want to work with are going to be strings so I am going to make a number and I'm going to make it a binary number and you know there's a thing about like when you have eight bits it's kind of important here right each one of these is referred to as a bit each spot in a binary number is a bit when you have eight of them that's a byte and so this has to do with how things are stored in the computer's memory right everything ultimately in the depths of your computer is stored in binary format and the amount of Spacek takes up is the number of bytes or kilobytes or gigabytes etc terabytes but I'm going to waste a lot of space and encode my binary number as a string so let's just say let's just try something really simple like 1 0 0 and we know that should be 4 right 0 1 1 0 no that's not 4 yeah it's 4 I lost my mind for a second there right this is 0 this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 this is 4 so we should get we do this right we'll get 4 ok now I want to write a function I'm gonna call it bin binary to decimal it'll take in any arbitrary value which is a string and we could make this much more generic so by the way as a challenge to you what if you made a function like this which is just number converter it takes a number and to base a base and a second base so here's the number in a given base give it back to me in another base it'll be generic that's a challenge for you to do now or later or whenever you want ok so the thing that I need to do is I need to loop through the sorry I equals 0 I is less than value dot length so if it's a string I'm going to loop through the string one character at a time so for each character the way to convert it is to add up all of the twos so for example 1 0 1 is 5 because it is 1 0 0 plus 0 0 1 is 101 and this is 4 and this is 1 so 1 0 1 is 5 so if I just start here and take the first digit multiplied by 2 and take the second digit multiplied by sorry x 1 the second digit x to the third digit multiplied by 4 add all those things together and by the way it's not just 1 to 4 it's 2 to the 0 2 to the 1 2 to the 2 2 to the 3 so it's the exponent that's counting up so I'm going to say sum plus equal power and now I need to get this value so I need to get V I need to get the 0 or the 1 so I'm gonna say the bit equals a value car at I now here's the thing mmmhmm this is an interesting question here what is I when it starts at 0 I is actually the string representation this is the zero index so even though I want to do the conversion by starting over here I'm actually over here so I actually want to get to the end of the I want to start from the end of the array another you write the end of the string and a quick way that I can do that is by saying val val dot length minus i minus 1 right if there are three digits I have not I have 2 1 0 not 0 1 2 2 1 0 so 3 minus I minus 1 so sum equals power of 2 to the bit and I need to make this a number so I'll just use parse int because it's a string and then let's just say console dot log some and I think we're done sort of console that logs some and let's see let's let's do a binary binary to decimal Val and actually so this should returned numb sorry and oh there we go for let's test some other ones out let's add another 1/6 let's try one zero one zero zero this is a byte right if all the ones are on in a byte right everything is on eight bits is a byte and if everything is a one what do we get ok I need one more wait what's going on well something is wrong no this isn't right I've made a mistake too to the parse int bit by the way down low is asking why not iterate from Val dot length minus one to zero what did I get wrong here ohohoh this is not right at all oh my goodness I'm so wrong this code is not correct at all so remember I am each digit represents a 1 a 2 a 4 2 to the 8th power I actually even said that somewhere somewhere I some time earlier I'd say to be i2 power maybe only in my head so what I'm actually doing is taking that bit and multiplying it now of course it's a string so I have to convert it the string value it now this is what I'm looking to do and now 255 there we go boy huh so now it's getting there were some right answers by accident so that should be 4 this should be 5 yep look at the kid have twos there that should be 18 so I should probably write some error handling right because actually this would actually work if I put a 3 in there it's gonna give me a number but it makes no sense at all so and once again I was what I wanted to show was that 8 bits all on gives me 255 and in fact this is why we see again the range you can store 256 possibilities in a single bite a bite being 8 bits 256 in decimal or 2 digits in hexadecimal okay I'm getting some messages from the chat saying that maybe it would be more intuitive to run the loop backwards so yes but then I have to so it's six of one half dozen of the other as far as I'm concerned because I either have to invert it here or I have to invert it here so I don't know which would be more I mean I could have a counter so you know I could do this counter equals zero and I could run the loop backwards and then increase the counter but I don't know I'm gonna stick with what I have all right now I said this was gonna be a long one and I'm gonna let it just be a long one you want to stick around keep watching you could go through something else but what I'm going to do is now make this interactive so I want to make something where I can actually click here and I can turn on and off bits and see the conversion live so let's figure out how we're gonna do that so I think I want to use some objectoriented programming and I am going to make a class I'm going to make an add another javascript file called bit j/s and I am going to make a bit class and the bit class is going to have a and let me take off this auto refresh for right now it's gonna have an X I'm gonna just it's gonna have an x and a y and a psyche with a size maybe I'll make it on a circle so it's gonna have like a diameter I'll use a circle to represent each bit and then it's going to have a state right its state is going to be on or off then I'm going to have a show function or render I could call it where I'm gonna say a stroke 255 let's make the outline white and should it be I know I can never figure this out is is black on white on I don't know maybe I should make it red and blue we'll figure it out I'll we'll see how it looks so I'm gonna say draw an ellipse at this dot X this dot Y this dot diameter and its fill is going to be 255 times this dot state so in this case it would be white if it's on so what I want to do now is make an array and let's just let's just use eight we'll do a byte and actually so I could call this a byte well that's probably like a bad word for me to use because maybe that's reserved somewhere in JavaScript but let's say I equals zero I is less than eight I plus plus and let's make a bit equals a new bit at I times so let's say I want to fit all eight across in mind I could use Dom elements or something that's gonna be easier to interact with but I'm just going to draw them as circles so I am going to say I need to calculate a width which is the width of the canvas divided by eight so I'm gonna say it's its x value as I times with its Y value will be at fifty and its diameter will be W and I'm gonna say byte index I equals that bit and I guess I don't need a separate variable here I'll just do this and then I want to say here I want to say byte index I dot show so what do we got oh let me turn back on auto refresh and I've got some errors show is undefined I see a show function oh wait whoops I put these in the wrong place the creation of them has to be in setup and note stop don't all right unbid is not to fight oh of course I forgot that if I'm adding another JavaScript class I need to make sure I reference it from my HTML file and now we're seeing and if I if all of them have a state of on I'm not seeing anything so let's see oh I've got to pass in the arguments X Y D so right now I want to set the arguments based on this there we go there they are there's all my bits and maybe I want to offset them a little bit and maybe I actually want like this to be their diameter to be like have a little buffer in it whoops there we go so this is looking nice there are my bits thank you very much oh I'm excited about this this is gonna be good and now if I take the state and like state zero there we go so now let's make this state let's actually also initialize the state I'm just going to write that and in a separate so I'm gonna set State and I'm gonna actually say numb dot car at I so I'm going to use the character sorry I'm gonna use the the individual character there to set the state of the particular bit now set state is not a function because I need to add that in here and I'm going to say set state state and I'm gonna say this dot state equals and I'll add parse int in here just to make sure it's a number and now what's going on set state is not a function set state I see that as a function sketch dot o is not of course byte index I dot set state there we go so now as I change values in here it chain turns those bits on off okay we're getting somewhere now what I want to do is I'm going to add a decimal I'm gonna say decimal P decimal P equals create P grapey and then in the draw loop and it's filly that I have a draw loop here I don't need to continue to draw but that's something that can revise later I'm gonna say where's that function binary to decimal binary to decimal I'm going to say decimal P HTML binary to decimal num and so now we should see it says undefined whoo Oh cuz it's console.log again I want to return some okay 182 now you can barely see that so let me go to my CSS for a second and add a color and guess what I'm gonna use accessible we'll actually do it no I can use three FS because it'll but um let's use six to do RGB and let's also make the font size like much bigger okay so now and let's actually make this a just it's got this extra because it's a paragraph element actually this is so silly but I'm gonna make it a div just so it shows up up here okay so now this is not interactive but I could do this and it does feel it does look inverted right this really looks like on/off on on the way that I've kind of drawn this somehow the black color looks like I've turned it on so you know I could probably make the background much darker like if I made the background like 51 yes maybe this look like stand still I don't know it's so confusing what if I'm a I don't know which is which you tell me I my visual design skills are kind of a disaster but if I go back to this but anyway whichever way I think it is I could actually just say 255 minus this and now right now it is colored black when it is on and I could say one zero one zero one zero zero one we could see 169 okay should I make this interactive I mean I've gone on for way too long already let's make because I need to make this interactive do you know why because the whole point of doing this was to talk about pitch shifting and bit masking I'm gonna get to that that I'll do in a separate video let's make this interactive so what do I need here I need some sort of function to see if it if this a bit contains a point so if so what I need to do is calculate the distance between this point and its X&Y and then if the distance is less than the radius which is the diameter divided by two and it's this dot diameter and I'm going to call this toggle I'm actually just gonna I could return I'm going to make this toggle function then I'm going to say this dot state equals now if the state is a zero I want it to be a 1 if it's a 1 I want it to be a zero what's a nice way of doing that I mean I could write an if statement speed this part of me thinking up I mean not okay I thought of a way I could say not this times 1 right wouldn't it what's gonna give me a true with this work no we hold on yeah I know I could use that silly ternary thing no I know not state would work plus 1 mod 2 I love that to the power of negative 1 well these are all such good suggestions all such good suggestions true or false yeah yeah all right so people give me great suggestions like hold on I lost all the suggestions now Oh anyway oh yeah people are giving people give me great suggestions like plus one modulus two to the power of negative one I think I'm just gonna admit to myself that really what I meant was for this to be true or false so I'm gonna the state's gonna be false and when I say set state I'm gonna do parse boolean it's that a function in JavaScript let's see if it is and then I could say not this dot state parse boolean is not defined there's no parse boolean but if I do boolean ah there we go okay so boolean is like a function I guess or that will convert that to this and then here what I want to do is I could just say if this dot state fill 0 and of course this is rather awkward but I don't care this is how I like to write code there we go mmm this is not this is no good no good that didn't work oh you know what those are strings so this needs actually say parse int there we go okay we're back we're back baby okay now this boy there's lots of things you could improve right all right now what I can do is make these interactive so I can now add the mousepressed function and I can just say for and I can loop through again once again I can loop through and this should really be byte length I can do this and I can look through all of them and I can say toggle whoops no and I can just call toggle with the mouse coordinates and now look at this oh but how come it's not updating oh shoot it's been a half an hour especially not so bad so it's toggling the toggling is working but it's not updating why is it not updating because oh I am converting this string this my function converts a string so I could do something like make the I could make the buying it the decimal version of the number out of the array of bit objects but I think what might actually work nicely here is for to make the string out of it so what if what I do now is I say in here I'm gonna say well let's go I'm just gonna use that same variable num equals an empty string and then I'm gonna say num plus equal oh this isn't set up sorry in draw plus equal oh now I want to have a 0 or a 1 but in excited state so this is where I have to use but I have to embrace the ternary operator it's something that I have never natively really understood it's like never fit into my brain but there's this thing called ternary operator and it looks like this the condition and if the condition is true this is the result if it's false this is the result we can make this happen right now we can use that ternary operator the condition is actually just bite in X is 8 then I need the question mark and this is so nice I just need to have if it's true a 1 or a 0 its false oh I need to say recreate that string whoa look it's going crazy there we go look at this now oh so lovely let's go everybody we did it I made a binary thing that you can click on bits and convert it to a binary number now here's the thing oh boy you the creative person watching if you made to the end of this video wow you really are so big thank you I can't believe it because this was ridiculously longwinded to just explain binary numbers but you now have the opportunity to make something creative here you could what if you made it you could make a clock that displays the time in binary maybe you could actually also show the hexadecimal value you could actually make this a form content editable that you could convert backwards how do you convert this as a thought experiment for you I can come back and do another video but how do you convert not from binary to decimal how would you convert from decimal to binary I'll give you a hint it has to do with division and the remainder I think so there's so many things you could do you can make a more interactive version you could make a counter that sort of oh this would be fun to have this like count up in binary well that's kind of like the clock you'll be in color other ways of visualizing it you'll come up with something I know you will you always do thank you so much for watching this coding challenge and I will I remember at the beginning when I said the whole point of this was talking about pitch shifting a bit masking I will come back and I will do that so that will be in a separate challenge I'm going to add some buttons for shifting and masking alright okay alright everybody I can't believe I spent the entire two hours basically on this of course I wasted half an hour and I did it twice but I think we've got something maybe hold on I gotta check my schedule I sigh I sort of said I was gonna be done at 1230 but I really want to do the masking and shifting because there's gonna be some really cool stuff you'll see what the shifting okay okay let me let me check the calendar here I'm on the calendar what time is the thing 1 o'clock ok the thing I need to go to is that one which is 40 minutes from now I also need to get lunch but I can bring lunch to the thing so I think that if I'm done at 1245 that's ok all right everybody I don't know why but this really pleases me I really like this this is who I am alright and that's actually and I think I can actually get I think it would actually be better I'm just gonna adjust the code a little bit to yeah okay all right so let me save this as actually maybe I should make them all on yeah let me save this and save it as bits and bytes here is the URL if somebody wants to post this in the chat and now duplicate yes duplicate well let me just say interactive bits interactive bits let's call it that then I'm gonna say duplicate and I'm gonna call it interactive bit well interactive bit shifting okay let me organize the code a little bit all right if it still works all right here we go oh let me erase all this okay okay I will read this Zachary and the chat rightz read my joke why do mathematicians always a mistake I don't have like a laugh do I have a laugh track no or like a bump why do mathematicians always mistake Halloween and Christmas because acht 31 equals Dec 25 I'm gonna put my salad I do thank you very much thank you all right um here we go hello welcome to coding challenge bit shifting so this is the second part sort of of this coding challenge series about binary numbers that all came from me work me do implementing this in the 7segment display video coding challenge and then everybody asking what was that that you did this shifting and masking makes no sense to me so what I did in the previous video if you actually managed to watch that video was I created this little interactive binary to decimal converter system so this is a single byte with eight bits every bit being on I don't know maybe that should be white if it's on black if it's off it whatever but black in this case means it's on and so you can see here if I toggle all them off I have a 0 this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 this is 4 so I can just toggle these bits on and off and get the decimal representation of that number ok so what do I want to do now what I want to do now is add bit shifting to this well what is bit shifting and why would you ever want to do it I don't know I mean I know what it is why you would ever want to do it well I needed to do it with my 7 segment challenge so maybe that's the reason why you do it let's okay so let's say for the sake of argument that we have the number 1 0 0 1 1 actually hold on let's say for the sake of argument that we have the number 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 so first of all I need to convert this into decimal just to I mean I don't need to to do bit shifting but just to sort of think about it so let's think about that this is 1 so this is 2 + 8 + 16 + 64 so that's 80 + 10 is 90 so this number is 90 where's my reciprocal okay so that's 90 so what is bit shifting so bit shifting when you take any number like the number 90 you can ask to for the computer to think about it in binary which it's already doing that's actually what it's doing and shift the bits around so I could say shift to the right or I could say shift to the left and I could say shift by a certain amount so let's say I just say shift to the right by one so this is bit shifting and what that actually does is it shifts all the bits over so this is a 0 this is a 0 this shifts are here that's a 1 that's a 0 1 1 that's a 0 and this is a 1 now interestingly enough I can tell you that this is the number 45 I hope it's the number 45 why this is what's really interesting shifting the bits over by 1 is actually the same operation as dividing by 2 think about the powers of 2 and a binary numbers work shifting to the other way to the left is multiplying by 2 look at this let's be sure about this this is 1 2 4 8 16 32 so 40 + 5 45 I was right so this is what bit shifting is basically does so in theory does when you say 90 divided by 2 does it shift the bits I don't know maybe but this is actually I've heard I think this was right that this is a faster way to / of course you can only do it with integers and how floating point numbers are representatives of bits is a whole other discussion but now what we can do is let's add this feature to our code and by the way we can shift by more than one at a time I could shift by four bits etc but all right and you might be thinking yourself I don't get it why is this one a zero like wouldn't there be some bit over here to shift in well when you apply bit shifting you can imagine that the number 90 if you were represented in two bytes all of these would be zeros so it always can only sort of assume that thing to the right of zero and whatever is here gets shifted over and basically gets removed so by the way if we tried to shift again and divide this we would get what would we get we get the number 22 we wouldn't get 22 and a half because we get the integer value of dividing that by 2 which takes off the decimal value ok let's add that so let's go over here and let's add a button let's add a shift B button and let's say and I'm just using shift button equals create button and I'll put this in the button so now it's it's so tiny but that's fine so this is going to be my button whenever I click it I'm going to shift the bits to the right so how am I going to do this hmm function so let's let's say shift shift button shift bits so I'm going to write a function called shift bits Q all of the jokes about me being Daniel shift man Mon chief ma what function with a C and now is not a function shift bits shift button Oh shift dot mousepressed this is the p5 Dom library that I will be able to attach a function as event to when I click the mouse on this button so now what I'm gonna do is okay well here's the funny thing is I I was doing this to show you about bit shifting oh I guess I could take that Oh interesting oh look at this think about ah this is really interesting so what there's a couple ways I could approach this problem if you watch the previous video all of these are like a bit object and I can I've kind of kept all information about like its X&Y its diameter and its state and I'm rendering it but what I'm actually gonna do here is I can take the decimal version right so so this is a little bit of code here I'm going to put into a function which is going to be which is just gonna be a function like get decimal so whatever the state is I'm going to get oh no that's get sorry get binary string this is going to return the binary string of whatever the visualization is reporting so I'm gonna say get binary string so now I'm back to what I had before right but now in this shift bits I can't do exactly this again so I want to get the binary string then I want to get the number then the value equals get you close binary to decimal oh that number then I want to say Val equals Val shift by 1 so I want to shift the bits over by 1 but now I'm gonna have to convert that back to binary I don't actually have a decimal to binary function what I want to say now is num equals decimal to binary right of value so this is what I want to do I want to be able to now anytime I click this get the could get the conversion back to decimal oh I have to write a new function so this was binary to decimal now I need to write a function I know I knew I would have to do this I left this as an exercise but I'm gonna need it now decimal to binary now again I could get JavaScript to do this for me natively with two string so for example if I just open up the console here and I were to say let numb equals 90 I could say numb to string two I'm done maybe I'll just do this it'd be really nice to just do this but I'm gonna do it myself so what I'm going to do is I need to get now I get a value in oh I'm using these variable names and terrible ways I need to do a refactoring of this with better variable names and what I'm going to do is and I know I'm going to always do this as eight bits so this is a bit of a constraint I don't have to be so super generic here I'm gonna say int I know not int let a equal zero ah I is less than eight I plus plus and now what do I want to do I need to divide it by so here's the thing how do you this work I'm pretty sure this is how you do it let's say I'm going to take the value 90 and try to turn that into binary so my theory here is that I'm going to divide by 128 divided by 64 divided by 32 divided by 16 divided by 8 divided by 4 and you can see what I'm doing here I am taking the thing same thing I did powers of 2 but I'm going to use the division operator what do I get when I say 90 divided by 128 I get a 0 90 divided by 64 I get a 1 remainder something 90 divided by 32 oh here's the thing so what's the remainder okay so this is what I need to the remainder here is sorry 60 470 480 426 so this bit is going to be a 1 and now I take that I don't take do 9 u divided by 32 ah what am I thinking here this is not what I meant to do ah something fell over get rid of this 9 here so this is 0 remainder 90 basically right 0 remainder 90 so that remainder comes over here now it's 1 remainder 26 26 comes over here 26 divided by 32 is 0 remainder 26 26 divided by 16 is 1 remainder 10 right 10 divided by 8 is 1 remainder 2 you can see where I'm going here so I should be able to do this now come back over here to the code it's weird how much fun this is for me so what I need to do now okay so I'm starting with the number and I'm gonna say the binary bits is this I'm going to use a string and I'm going to go from 2 to the 7th I equals 0 I is greater than equal I starts at 7 I goes down to 0 I and the remained I'm going to need this remainder value so the first thing that I want to do is to call the divisor equals power of 2 to the I then what I want to do is I need to do integer division so I want to say number I want to say the the answer or the the value the bit value equals number divided by divisor pause for a second I lost my chat number by divisor this is kind of awkward is there a way to do integer I'll just use foot number divided by divisor here's the thing I'm gonna use floor so Java JavaScript natively it's going to do everything as floatingpoint if I were in like the Java programming language it would just give me the without the remainder so and then I'm gonna say the remainder equals the equals the hold on it lost my train of thought for a second all right I lost the chat over here because I'm getting things are beeping at me to go to meetings okay what division it's like oh he's modulus you can simply do mod two to the I remainder equals numb okay sorry okay I forgot I forgot something that I have a whole video actually Golan Levin came did a guest tutorial about a particular operation called modulus represented I think they operated students called modulo and maybe they symbol is modulus I can never remember this someone's going to get a lot of comments telling me the correct way to do this I could just see it already but this gives you the remainder of the division operation so what I can do here and this by the way this should be remainder and remainder should be numb and then the remainder is the remainder modulus divisor right and now oh and this and the bit value is bits plus equal bit value boy is this possibly right and then return bits where did I let's just see if this function even works so one thing I could do actually I'm just going to go that the p5 web better consult isn't interactive but I can go here to the canvas frame and I can say right what was that name of that function decimal to binary and if I have the decimal number like one hunt I think that's right it works okay it's 255 yeah okay great so that works so now we're when I'm shifting right what was I doing I was shifting then I get decimal to binary and then what do I need to do update this is really in draw right in draw there's a draw function somewhere this is like update the states what oh no oh no where do I do that oh I did that here so I need to update all the states so look I have a set state function how convenient so I also now once I do that I need to go through and set the state to numb car at I and and this probably has to be a number but maybe I have that in set state oh it's Bulli right I forgot I have this whole crazy thing to take this string which is 0 1 turn it into number and turn it into a boolean perfect so it does that already so now I can shift oh boy / 2 / look at this oh my goodness so I can now bit shift wow this is let's go back to 90 right this is 90 whoops 90 okay ready here we go let's this is gonna be exciting moment no no aah don't click there no get back to 90 there we go but we now have interactive bit shifting now you the viewer of this you probably want to add shift the other way that wouldn't be too hard to add I do just add another button ship the other way maybe I want to actually have like a slide or shift by a certain number of bits maybe I don't want to limit myself to eight I want to have two bytes displayed but there's all sorts of possibilities now in terms of how I can do bit shifting I've got a new bit masking that's good because he's gonna be another video here okay but there's a couple things I want to I know everyone is going crazy that I have the black is on let's fix this let's make it more clear so I don't leave leave everybody in such a traumatized State so I'm gonna make the background 51 and then I'm going to in fill or I'm drawing it I am going to and let's let's use a ternary operator I'm comfortable with them now so I'm gonna say fill this dot state if this that state is on the Phyllis 255 or if it's off zero there we go so this is they're all off now they're on it looks weird to me Oh background 51 is like the same as the actual anyway so and I could shift now that's crazy yeah that looks better right I'm shifting down okay I forgot about you the viewer alright so I don't know thrill me with your weird weird variations on this I look forward to it I do need to do something about bit masking which I will do an ampersand and or an or and Simon has been telling me breaking news in the chat over and over again I can also do X or so you can also do X or as a bit wise operation so thanks for watching this challenge and I look forward to seeing what you make share with me stuff in the comments all your Corrections and complaints and happy thoughts or whatever and I'll see you again in another video goodbye all right all right everybody I've got to go oh yeah Soyuz 51 oh yeah yeah okay use 51 for disabled no oh yeah that's everything on and then make the stroke weight for this came from oh oh you're the chat scrolled by it yeah this is better but maybe also I want to just make this 200 yeah or maybe I want to make the stroke then zero how about that I don't know I can't figure out what to do I don't make it better I am so visually challenged stroke like what about if it was like pink or something I'm so visually challenged I think I'll just leave it let's just leave it at this let's make the stroke weight to not forty to two and let's have them be off at the beginning I could actually let's make it random at the beginning sets state random yeah I was gonna add floor in here but let's all right so that's good every time it starts it's something random okay ah Nathan writes second time in a row I've super chatted Dan and it went past him without noticing and Simon wants me to show the gist okay so hold on let me find well how come it goes away I don't see it here but thank you Nathan you solar liner I believe for the super chat that is very kind of you I'm sorry that I missed it I don't know how to like see the super chat if it's like in the past I don't have that maybe I can see it in my view over here no top chat no live chat super I can I can send a super chat what if I send a super chat to myself this is interesting was it gonna let me so far it's letting me hey it worked okay now can I see previous ones no I don't think so sorry I got a million messages here in github I mean it's like okay a super chapter floorliner tada now go to your meeting thank you I can probably see it in the history of my whatever what you might call it YouTube super I got to go get lunch I've ten minutes to get lunch before this thing I'm going to I don't want to be too late to it but I do oh and I forgot to record this thing to disk again I'm sorry Matt see I can't know why I can't remember that these days I there was something that I wanted to do there's something else Oh Simon's just alright so gist github.com slash Simon Tiger let's find this gist bitwise j s these are all the bitwise operations and or XOR not who not would be a fun one to do zero Phil shift left zero Phil shift right and signed boy so many more things to talk about Chris ray asked are you going to word Tyvek today sadly apparently no because I make a list of things to do and I think like it's I have two hours and I take much longer to do them so I the word to Beck's stuff I'm going to do because I teaching it in my class actually here at NYU next week so hopefully it'll happen next week maybe maybe I can find a time before next Friday even to do it I do want to mention one thing which is I'd be curious for any feedback on this I've been really trying to find a new merchant I shop people request merchandise and actually if I just go to I think the coding training channel and go to community tab I posted a link there so this is a bunch of new designs that I'm actually wearing one of them right now the microphone just went you know the microphone is still attached to me you can see never forget that this dot shirt is here underneath so adjacent Haglund who has done all the illustrations for the coding train has made a whole new set of designs with I'll refactor that later never forget this dot and all the different coding train characters so I've been trying to find a good place to have these available for people who are interested and I really like this new site called designed by humans so right now it's just in progress there's very few options ooh apparently I can sign up and get 10% off my next order can I go away from that but for example if I click here I think I can see like this shirt but there's like other colors and there's like anyway I'm curious for feedback does this you don't have to buy anything but you could sort of like click around here just see how it works for you and then a comment in this thread with any feedback or things that would be helpful then that would be that would be super helpful to me I'm gonna try to launch this hopefully sometime next week and I believe this is this is my question so Rahul asked can you send those tshirts to India one of the reasons why I picked design for humans is well one is they they seem to have a nice policy in terms of the quality and labor practices of the shirts that they make so again I haven't done a deep dive into this but a brief view of their site seems like a good organization with good quality stuff made in with good practices and they also have international shipping at reasonable prices so check that for me Rahul even if you don't buy anything if you could click all the way into like where the last step before you would buy or at least calculates your shipping let me know what that price is for you to India you can send me a tweet or a comment on that thread in the community tab I would love to know that all right everyone ma you are so wonderful to give a shout out doesn't need a shout out but I've been watching smarter every day recently loved those videos and watching them with my kids random shoutout to a much larger youtube channel than me but i one of the things that I saw that I was actually thinking of doing is a coding challenges recent we can find it a smarter every day I really need to go this is something I'm thinking of doing I never know like about reappropriation other contests okay not the backwards brain bicycle this one cannon shockwaves let me find um he shows oh wow these are like not skippable ads interesting I don't have not skippable ads enabled for my channel spectra by the way oh thank you ah okay oh my goodness the gaming Jin writes I want to thank you for all the videos you have made they're super useful by the way I am deaf so I can't hear you in the stream alright so I want to just pause for a second to address this I have been I'm really priority for me as accessibility and I have all of my video tutorials the edited versions that come out of the livestream that I use for my courses all of those are now being captioned through rev.com and I make sure that captions are there before I upload publish them so I would like to know I'd love to hear from you if those captions are helpful and work for you I some of my recent live streams and I recognize the absurdity of me doing this where the gaming Jin is not able to know what I'm talking about right now there are automated captions but I have been trying to do live captioning with a company called white coat captioning so I'm gonna type a message to the gaming jinn right now just in the chat please get in touch via email or Twitter I'd love to chat captioning for accessibility so I'm writing that in the chat right now there is I do I think I have the automated live captions which are something but anyway I would love to I love to be in touch to figure out ways to make the live streams more accessible and I've actually been asking YouTube about this directly so somewhere in this video Destin does frame differencing on the slow motion this is it this is like totally wild so this is a slowmotion cannon firing but with a frame differencing algorithm applied to it and it really like shows these shock wave patterns I was maybe I'll get in touch with Destin I would love to get the raw footage and try to implement the code and I guess I could probably pull it off the channel but I think I probably ought to get permission to do this well that's a giant Destin there if I'm saying the name raise it Dustin or Destin but I would love to get to try to do that in processing I think that would be interesting okay I was watching this last night with my kids and they stayed up way too late no more smarter every day at night kids you kids stay up late watch the smarter every day but my kids go to bed on time please thank you very much everybody I have to go this is the end of today I'm gonna just check the chat Destin okay I am I recently had the chance to meet Destin that was awesome of him oh I was I played it cool though alright looking at the chat we'll get the chat all right all right everybody do you dye your hair because you had videos with gray hair you know I don't it's a great question actually and I think what it is is the green screen actually makes the gray less also when I have shorter hair it's not as obvious and the focus will be off you can see first of all you can see me with a balding up here but I think for whatever reason the a green screen maybe if I go to the if I take that off this is very important to address of course this is the question I'm choosing to answer each oh wait no it's here what's locked filters yeah I turn off the filtering nope ah there we go all right there's my baldness and my gray hair plenty of gray hair but somehow the camera makes me look younger we turn that back on and I have to put this back no open broadcaster you ill enough there we go goodbye everybody good night see you next week I have to find where I shut the stream off awkwardly gonna be here for a little longer Lotte be on the lookout for my word to vex series which is going to start publishing public as soon as this weekend or Monday or whatever and yeah
