hey I should be I should be back test tests I think I am back I have a little bit of an issue with this other camera you guys are gonna enjoy seeing this for a second let me see I think if I press this button that should go away there we go so I'm really having some serious technical problems which I thought I had resolved but I clearly need to do some work before next week and I wouldn't be surprised if this crashes again now so unfortunately when it crashes it seems to focus the crash crashing baguettes crashing so what I was trying to do and now I realized thank you to me I am swimming in the slack group is that I don't think that you can actually see the matrix implementation in with HTM line so I think what I might actually do for the purpose of this video for explanation purposes so let me open up processing because the processing works exactly the same way so the mate the main thing that I want to do is I want to discuss why it's called push and pop and the concept of a stack and a queue sort of but I also want to talk about why it's called a matrix so let me get something let me get something going in processing just really quickly to see if this will do what I want it to do and what I want to say is no loop and I want to say print matrix and I want to say translate 100 comma 0 and once they print matrix again and someone remind me what's the what's a good nice succinct way of explaining why for two dimensions you need three numbers that's weird why did it in three dimensions you need four numbers so this is the default there should be two rows of this that doesn't seem right print matrix processing org um let me see print matrix well I don't have anyone just joined by accident I apologize I had a live stream going for like almost two hours that froze and crashed so I just like jumping right here in the middle because this should do all right I mean if I change this to P 2d it will give me what I'm expecting that's weird that doesn't seem right to me I should get this right okay so maybe I have to give up on this whole print matrix thing cuz I don't know why this isn't working now to give me an actual proper printout of what them because it's I've done this before in teaching where you kind of look at the default you hello so when this seems to happen what seems to help is I have to reap so this shouldn't I have to I'm I will not be streaming next week without different software or some major change because I thought it was a fluke last week but clearly that's not the case and hopefully you can see me now and hear me when I just check here yeah I don't see myself in my preview but as it working now no yes okay so what seems to be going on is I've bought right now trying to stream in 720p with some like idea that that might help instead of 1080p and what seems to happen is that I want to use open broadcast studio and I wasn't able to get that to work but I think I'm gonna have to just allocate some time the next week to trying to use that instead or maybe wiping the computer and reinstalling and resetting this setup up but if you if your bear with me for a second I'm gonna configure this is just the raw view now if the green screen I'm gonna I want to just come back as soon as I can I'm going to add the laptop and move that down and I'm going to and a chroma keying and then shrink myself a little bit and go over here to the corner and so I think you should see me now in my usual I think I might be smaller I think I might be smaller yeah I'm surgery on the elbow might have called all that caused all this alright I'm sorry I'm getting a little I'm sad that this is happening or trying to make this bigger alright so I am back up and running I kind of feel like when I'm not recording to disk I wonder if I can get away without recording to disk I'm gonna record to disk though I don't think that's the problem it's weird alright I'm according to disk now also alright so apologies for that I would just weep and so like I have to do this so often now I've gotten pretty good at I just like rebuilt the entire like Wirecast configuration really quickly maybe matrices maybe just only it's maybe it's matrices which are the problem because you know when you do machine learning you've got to work with matrices now I'm trying to do transformations and work with matrices I even get to custom shapes a clock coding challenge it's almost 6 o'clock a max might be the problem ok so let me see if I can keep going here I'm gonna give up on what I was going to attempt to show you because maybe just try this real quick yeah I don't know why this is not this print matrix function that I used to use doesn't work I'm gonna give up on showing that to you and I'm just going to explain that the values for describing how things are in a matrix okay look at this anybody wants to do something for p5 you could contribute an example this this webpage is a very few pieces of reference that don't have examples left to contribute there's some information on the p5 wiki here's one it may be implementing print matrix I don't know so I would love to look into that because I don't know that you need it so much but it is quite at apply matrix real quick it's useful for teaching so I could come back if we could get that implemented in p5 that would be an interesting thing to try to do apply there we go yes so this also this also is not really there's no example so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna fumble my way through this I'm gonna quit processing and this will be just one more follow up video about transformations which is really just gonna make use of the whiteboard because I don't know what else to say oh I didn't make the whiteboard shot give you a second here so I got to make the whiteboard shot capture device is three no that's the laptop capture device is two that's the green screen you and the laptop just completely disappeared hold on you guys can you guys see all this craziness that's going on I don't know if you can like I don't know if it's like live updating all the nonsense that I'm trying to do I'm back and god what a mess there we go P 30 there we go save hello in here okay uh all right oh I don't get to all the things I wanted to get to today this is terrible when can I come back alright so maybe I should just do the let me finish let me do this let me do this it's 545 I think I can manage to stay here until 600 and let's see what I can get done here and oh and I didn't hold on I have to do one more thing keyboard shortcut for this to work to keyboard shortcut for this to work one save two and alright so this is the third video about transformations this is the one that I was saying maybe you should skip but I just wanted to talk about a couple things in this video which are background about how these things work they're not really necessary for using them but I you know somebody said somebody told me they were interested in this at one point so push and pop so one thing you might ask yourself is what happens when I call push multiple times and pop multiple times well and this is actually something you often want to do if you want to have all these sort of nested systems and and and it relates to why these are called push and pop oh and something else about pushing pop let's start this video over all right it's there's no audio on the whiteboard scene is that still the issue or that was an old message there's no audio sworkit on the whiteboard scene I think you probably told me that wasn't before but now it's okay it's fine now okay all right so I'm gonna make one more video here about transformations just to like cover a few bases that I didn't get to and some of this is unnecessary information you could probably get this one but if you want to dive a little bit deeper into this there's there's there's a few things about this the first thing I want to say that's actually quite crucial about push and pop is that push and pop doesn't just save and restore transformation information and this is actually not true if you're using processing the Java based platform that I use in some of my videos this is only true if using p5.js because it's the way that the html5 canvas works you're using all these terms that I know that I don't want to use but I'm using them so it actually saves and restores lots of style information as well which can be useful to you so for example if I go back to this code and at the at the end here if I just want to draw another ellipse like the other ellipse is gonna be at 300 is gonna be at 300 360 60 and I hit refresh now look at this this ellipse is not gray with a white stroke with a white outline it should be because I said stroke 255 fill 100 drew the rectangle but actually push and pop also save and restore stroke weight stroke fill all sorts of styling things now if I could try to give you a list of every single function that's everything will setting that's saved and restored by pushing pop and I wouldn't know I would be able to begin but but in addition to the transformation stuff you can also use this for styling information which I generally don't but you might find this useful in another context so that's it that's number one now the other thing that I want to mention is that you could imagine a more complex scene where you know this thing is rotating around this thing and this other thing is rotating around this thing but there's other thing is rotating this thing but not this thing and you start needing to say push draw some stuff push draw some stuff push draw some stuff pop draw some stuff pop pop or something like that right so one thing you should realize is you could only have as many pops as you have push you could only restore the amount of things you've saved but there the question arise is which is when I save a bunch of times and I restore which thing that I save do I restore and a way that you can determine the answer of this question is is the way that I'm saving the sequence in something called a stack or a queue or perhaps some other algorithm so there's something called a stack and there's something called a queue now if I spelled that wrong a queue what are these things so push and pop are terms that apply to saving and restoring information in a stack it's called a stack because you can think of it like a stack of paper so if this is like a bin your inbox so to speak and I put paper a in there then paper B then paper C then paper D they're stacking up a b c d so push is pushing the things onto the stack adding to the top of the stack when i say pop i take the last thing out so first one in last one out the last one in first one out that's what it is the stack the last thing i put at the top of the pile of paper is the first one i'm gonna take off this is different than a queue which you could think of like you know some kind of like ticket window right where people line up in a queue the first person in line for the queue is the first person to get a ticket so these are data structures that are that are common to a lot of programs and a lot of scenarios that if you watch all of my videos might come up with lots of other places you don't really need to worry about this too much in the case of transformations but it is important to realize that push and pop are terms that relate to the data structure a stack they were sort of pushing things onto the stack popping things off of the stack and if you push multiple times save multiple times you're restoring in reverse order so I should cook up some kind of example I can't think of come back and do that another time but that's one thing I want to say now the other thing I want to say about transformations if I come back is let me go to the p5 jazz jazz reference and let me search transformation transform you're gonna see so first of all that you're gonna see there's a couple other things oh did you shake it just oh shoot I got to do that again because I didn't switch the camera hi everybody let me come back there's one more thing I want to show I mean with a p5 reference here I'm gonna go to transform and I'm gonna look at all these functions so there's a couple things there there's some things that are important here number one is oh my goodness in addition to rotate there's rotate X and rotate Y rotate Z now those functions rotate XY and Z actually no idea what she Rex in here why do we we should look at look at the reference to read that those functions are for the WebGL renderer the WebGL render is a 3d render for p5 you know at the recording of this video it's still in the very early stages there was a lot of work that was done over this past summer through a program called Google Summer of Code so it's the WebGL library is in much better shape and hopefully will continue to improve it's a way of doing 3d and p5 I should come back and make it on the video about that and look at transformations in 3d so but you know in case you're wondering if you're you know rotate is the same as rotate Z the z axis is the axis that comes out of the screen and so things rotate around the z axis if I come back to this write this over here I think I'm like desperate to do this like exact demonstration that I want to do this is good that's the z axis this is pathetic that's the z axis I'm pointing at you so that's something rotating around the z axis if it was rotating around the y axis it would come out of the screen like this it was rotating around the xaxis would come out of the screen like this but not actually come out of the screen because it's 2d and I've off it neverneverland talking about 3d but it's really it's just the illusion explore that on your own time or I will come back to in a future video but the other thing I wanted to mention here is you'll see like o apply matrix reset matrix why is the word matrix there what are we talking about well it turns out that the way the orientation the transformation state what does the transformation stay zerozero in the topleft is there any rotation is there any scaling is stored in a matrix of numbers and that matrix and numbers might look something like this 1 0 0 0 1 0 so this is a 2x3 matrix 2 rows 3 columns and this is describing the sort of default matrix with no rotation no translation no scaling you can imagine if I scale by 2 this matrix might turn into 2 2 if I translate some of these numbers might change if I rotate some of these numbers might change so I would love to do some kind of tutorials pretend that I know all about this and we can do something like tutorial series about you know programming your own transformation engine 3d rendering thing and like how you calculate all these matrices but this is what's more important about it is that as you do this it's it's all stored in a matrix so some things you can do is you can just actually call the reset matrix function and reset is like just wipe everything so push push push pop pop pop is like save save save restore restore but if you just want to reset back to the default state you can just call reset matrix apply matrix I've never actually used this and I don't know how far along if this actually works maybe five but but in theory if it does what it's supposed to do is I could cook up my own set of numbers put that into some kind of array or something and then apply that to the matrix hi this video better go far away buried deep somewhere in the playlist because this really isn't part of the first few weeks of learning to program but I'll figure that out later boys so that's really the last pieces that I want to explain what is push and pop and what is why why do we talk about a matrix when we talk about transformations okay thanks all right oh it's just three by two matrix but isn't it two by three don't you say the when you talk about matrices in linear algebra don't you say the number of rows first than the number of columns next so that's a mistake in the p5 page right so or did I get it wrong somebody will tell me somebody will help me alright so here's the thing we don't have very much time left I would like to do something a bit more exciting and interesting for this 100th livestream plus I said I would read 100 random numbers which I will do somebody's gonna who by the way whenever you do 100 random numbers somebody's gonna have to stop okay so I said it correctly that's great I think I should do that I think I should probably do that yeah I should this is great me I am so me is referencing canvas rendering context 2d transform so p5 by the way the way that it is just wrapping all of these functions that are built into that are built into the browser itself and so I guess it's using this so we could learn more by looking at this but I don't I don't want to do that right now okay all right let's try doing a let's do a this stream let's do the clock I think I should do the clock coding challenge rather than try to make a video tutorial about custom shapes with vertices and I'll just come back to that next week I mean I could do the straw poll thing but I sort of feel confident that that's it's good to have each week have a coding challenge don't you think and I'm gonna do a really simple clock so let me pull up some I need to pull up some URLs real quick so let me pull up these URLs so I want to look at the 12 I want to find the 12 o'clock series John Maeda interesting this oh actually this is the page that I want to look for yeah I think goal on Levin who teaches at Carnegie Mellon we made a bunch of these with p5.js I thought he said that to me but that would be a wonderful project if he didn't for us to do as a community let me look okay let me look at this page new media clocks and clock assignment anybody wants to like follow along with me see if you could find anything online that says that goal on Levin with the club so look at this this is great this is kind of like this is great this is kind of like what I want to do oh and he's doing it with K so this is such a nice fun assignment so we're gonna do this assignment which is due oh my god just do today perfect this is great this is great so I'm gonna mention this and I mention my does don't let me just look at my Twitter messages did I imagine that I recently got his clocks working again and documented them on my course website so I don't know if that means working again in p5 or just running in but I would be great to port all these to p5 Golan are you on Twitter right now kind of to tone tweet of and asking whether they actually are ported to p5 or not or when he says he got them working I'm gonna do direct message him now nobody tweets you know I'm sweet I go get it working by running on and bold OS alright okay so I wish I knew the answer to this question because but I will if maybe he'll get back to me or I will simply so let's do this clock coding challenge so I was thinking of doing it with arcs I want to do something simple I mean arc is a kind of nice thing but maybe I should actually just do the do like a simple template like this like this is a nice of what I do what I want to do is I want to make a clock that's really simple like this I guess this one R exists so I'm not going to recreate this without like a really strong design point of view I want to show alkis clocks also let me get that that's a great example what is let me let me find Alka can you or somebody just post in the patron group slack channel the link to the alkalis have to scroll back and find it in slack which is a little hard for me to do what live Alka code I'm going to look and see maybe if these are some really nice examples from Alka collections I'm going to be able to find it collections clocks there we go okay so I'm also going to reference this these are wonderful so something like this would be a great thing for me to do like just this like floating Bart clock so sorry alright so let me look at the chance up what's the chance that go on messaged me back no not yet all right okay all right so here we go I am going to check my phone which is always the greatest thing to do while I'm livestreaming make sure there's no emergencies that because I'm Way behind as always oh the camera went off that's good timing and this is gonna be the last thing that I'm going to do which is the clock Cody time I think I'm gonna do it with arcs because arcs is kind of interesting and then I can explore arcs also in this video if I switch to the whiteboard you don't hear the music right yeah I need to erase the whiteboard I could fix that but because I've got to need the whiteboard so okay I can hear the music but you can't first the camera went off for the 100th livestream maybe it would be nice to create a page with 100 clocks or something like that this is B trying to make this into something more special besides the usual like everything keeps crashing and not working and I'm Way behind and I get tired and hungry and wiped out and all sorts of stuff like that okay it's the only reason why you're hearing it lower over here is because it's coming in through the my mic because I can hear it okay so I'm gonna assume no I'm gonna assume that when he got them working to make these gifts that he just ran it on an old computer and be interesting to try to port some of these two three five and we could do that as a project all right all right everybody here we go tick tock tick tock goes the clock anyway this is a coding challenge where I am going to make a very simple very basic clock in p5 GS why am I doing this well if you are beginning to learn about programming and learn about graphics and animation a great exercise that you can do that can really can really express your creativity with is invent a new way of showing time make make a clock and whatever imaginative crazy way has never been done before and it's really easy to get the time information with p5.js and then it's just up to you to figure out what to draw based on that time information now the inspiration for this idea comes from also very loud squeak John Midas twelve o'clock so John Maeda this is a project from 1996 to 97 made in classic Mac for classic Mac you could see here are examples of John Maeda 12 clocks and these were this this documentation page was created by Golan Levin who as for his course at Carnegie Mellon University oh that's from last year maybe has an assignment which is to create your own clock and so here's an example clock made in p5.js a template and you can see this is what I'm talking like to do something like this which just shows you the mechanics of how you get the hour the minute the second and draw something based on those and template that you could use and I hope that making this video will inspire a world of so many clocks that I could never possibly imagine and I can't wait to see all the clocks that people are going to make after watching this video and I will try to come back and make more oh I want show you if you're looking for more inspiration I gotta get to making the clock this is a collection of clocks made by Alka loyal viewer of the coding train and there's some wonderful ones this is one of my this is a really nice one the particle clock will just look at this where we can see like a look at this these are particles so this is actually having particles fly around and end up and use it with the actual numbers of the time I'm gonna try to draw something based on time so okay so time out I need an edit point here because I just realized I need to like create the code project so hold on a sec this is a little edit point in the video I'm gonna say clock and I'm going to go back to the browser clock and I'm going to take out everything so for this Oh I'm editing the wrong file aren't I let me do this okay that's good checking my Twitter messages let me just ask what asking asking because I was going to give porting all the clocks as a challenge to yours okay so some loyal viewers I say some oil viewer did I like describe Alka in a weird awkward way that I should redo that video hopefully it's okay alright I now have some empty code and I am ready to start programming the clock so there's two things I want to talk about before I start writing some code number one is how do I get the time information so this is actually one of the things the p5 does for you I mean it's just wrapping native JavaScript file on functions that are part of the browser for getting the current time based on your computer's clock and if I go to the p5 reference we can see those under time and date so I can get the day the hour the minute the month the second and the year I'm just gonna use our minute I'm just going to use and second okay no three hour minute and second Millie's is a different is something different Millie's go away phone Millie's is a function that gives you the number of milliseconds that have passed since the sketch started and this could be used for timers and keeping track of things and thinking an animation to a clock and it's interesting and useful but I'm gonna actually just pull and I'm not gonna do like you know fracture those of a second I'm just gonna pull hour minute and second from from p5 so let's actually really quickly just like spin up a digital clock so I'm gonna say let our equal hours let minute equal minutes I think this is right let second equal seconds for those the name of the functions hour minute second boy this is so this is a terrible idea that I just did hour minute second I'm gonna call this HR for owl and n for minute and SC for second I really should come up with better variable names than that that's what I'm gonna do right now and what I'm going to do next is I'm just gonna say fill 255 no stroke and then I'm gonna say text hour + + minute + + seconds and I'm gonna put that at 10 comma 200 so let's see if this works we have a really quickly there we go we have our clock right it is now six oh eight and twenty eight twenty nine thirty seconds is that the right time oh my god so that's why I'm gonna keep going with this kind of jobs and I'll leave when I'm done this is good actually to do it when I'm supposed to be somewhere that I have the coding challenges to me at the time so there's no zero there so I need to think about number formatting and you know there's all sorts of interesting things I could do for designing making a digital clock I'm leaving all the creative ideas to you but what I want to do is visualize the time so I think my idea to do something rather simple but it's a little bit more interesting than just bars is I'm going to use arcs so this is what the ellipse function does in p5 the ellipse function draws an ellipse or a circle at a given X Y according to some width and according to some height and the width and height could be the same because you get to give that just as a diameter if it's a perfect circle so I'm actually just going to have an ellipse and an XY with a particular diameter okay what the arc function does is exactly the same thing it draws an ellipse at a given X Y with a given diameter however in addition to the X Y the diameter width and height I can give a start angle and an end angle meaning I can say draw this arc from 0 to 180 degrees so I'll only see this part of the of the circle so let's see how that works come back over here and come back over here and this is not the code okay let me try that again come back over here and let's try to draw just to see this in action I'm gonna get rid of the text now I don't need that anymore I can use that for debugging I'm gonna draw an ellipse at 200 200 I'm gonna say stroke wait for no Phil and I'm going to give it a diameter of let's just say 200 right now let's yeah no let's say 300 and let's take a look at that oh and I need to say stroke 255 so there's my ellipse right that's the full lips now what I want to do is I want to draw an arc so I'm gonna say stroke and I'm gonna give it some arbitrary color and I'm gonna say arc and I'm gonna give it exactly these same values and I'm going to say 0 to 360 0 to 360 which means draw the whole thing the full circle from 0 all the way 3 or 6 degrees the problem is I want to think of degrees here I've talked in other videos about degrees versus radians a different unit of measurements it's an interesting topic but it's easier for me right now I think to just say angle mode degrees so that the unit of measurement that I'm using in the arc function is degrees and if I run this we see this whoops this circle what just happened there the circle I don't want to be there sorry everybody we see the circle turned pink but it didn't actually turn pink right if I make the stroke weight of this eight whoops oh and the stroke weight of this one for we can see the pink arc inside of the white one and I could say with the arc like let me only have 180 degrees half of that and you can see that it's drawing that inside though that's drawing that inside only 180 degrees and what I could do is I could say let end equal to map the mouse X location which goes between 0 and width between 0 and 360 degrees and I could say end here so you can see as I move the mouse and this is a little I'm gonna I want to do this the and kind of like the other way around actually I know this is a little bit weird this makes no sense what I'm doing I'm gonna get rid of that one right you can see this is me drawing that full arc so going from zero all the way to 360 degrees and by the way there are varying ways I can fill in the arc like I'm at this point I probably just want to say no fill and it's just gonna do this but if I wanted to keep that fill there I can actually add a final argument I can say PI which is exactly this I'm feeling like it's a pie chart I can say open which actuate photoops I'm in the wrong function sorry everybody Matt you're gonna have to edit this I could say PI which is like filling it like a pie chart right you can see that I can say open which is filling it like this not as a pipe it straight across without connecting the stroke or I can actually say cord which is filling it like open but by connecting the stroke so that's a small detail but it's interesting to see how that works with arc kind of useful I don't care about any of that because I want to say no film so what I want to do now is instead of instead of just mapping this arcs location to the mouse I want to say map the number of seconds which goes between 0 and 60 to between 0 and 360 and look at that there's my clock with the number of seconds now I want to let me do the same thing again and one and two and I could be more thoughtful about this let me map the number of minutes that also goes between 0 and 360 but I'm gonna have it be you know 280 so a little smaller and n2 so there's the number of minutes right and as soon as seconds gets all the way to 60 this should go one more come on get to sixty here we go there we go minutes went up by one and now I'm gonna do the very last one and three between four hour an hour goes from zero to 24 and I could give some different colors here too also you know again I'm not being very thoughtful about the design that's what I'm hoping you who are watching this video were much more creative than me but I can now see and I actually want this one to be instead of 280 let's say 260 and now we can see I have the number of seconds the number of minutes and then the hour but this isn't right right because what do you what if I want these to actually point to where the V you know what's right what's wrong the point is to make a kind of creative clock that you wouldn't normally imagine seeing but what I what I would like to do here however is actually have these position in the correct place in the sense of like if it were 3 o'clock the ark would go from the top all the way to there so let's think about the time the time that I'm recording this right now is approximately 615 p.m. so the hours should go all the way to the bottom and so the hours 6 o'clock oh no but it's 24hour clock oh it's a 24hour clock let me just do that in a second and I'll think about no I can do it I could do it let's do it let's do it so one thing I could do is say actually the hours don't go between 0 & 24 they go between 0 and 12 and I just say modulus 12th so it'll restart once it gets to 12 and 13 will become 1 o'clock again so that we can see now this is being the hours but it's off what I really want to do is have that range not go from 0 to 360 but I want to start at negative 90 degrees right so this is confusing because rotation happens counterclockwise so if this is 0 agrees I want to start up here at negative 90 or I could also think of that as 270 right and I want to go from that all the way to itself do this this is an interesting problem because because I want it to go this will work right actually timeout somebody help me with this I me I am so Mia is just saying rotate that's a very interesting suggestion should be 0 to 59 thank you thank you thank you ok hmm what so me I am so me in the chat just said well why don't instead I could just rotate everything something interesting actually about in p5 is 0 degrees when you when you put the end at zero it actually will draw you the entire thing and it's sort of debatable whether that's a good or bad idea but mostly it confuses people if it doesn't do that so that's why it does that in p5 but let's come back here so there's a couple things I can do number one is I could just translate to the center so I could use it I have a whole video now about transformations that you could watch so I could just translate to 200 200 and I could draw all these at 00 so this I think will be a nice or easier way to deal with this and I can then just say rotate I think negative 90 so there we go so now we can see I'm coming up on finishing 60 seconds and here we go and it starts over again now but I and you can see so now it is sit thought that's not six the green should be at six oh you know why so somebody else Maxwell and the chat is telling me 0 to 59 so this is a problem I did which the mapping should actually be right from 0 to 59 minutes seconds 0 to 59 minutes and then zero right because we don't get 12 we get 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 and then 12 again so 0 2 11 and this shouldn't say oh I also messed this up this shouldn't say right so let me know no 12 was right there there we go did I did I get it right with the minutes should be it should be zero 259 12 is fine with the modulus because it's going back to it right let's see 0 1 Oh No Oh one to twelve zero to 11 time out yeah yes yes yes Matt I'm so sorry I'm so sorry so it's kind of hard to think about but it actually should be zero to 60 because 59 seconds does not end at the top it ends a little bit before that's why this should be zero to 12 and modulus 12 so I did this a few different ways but it is interesting to think about it but these are subtle little points but these should actually be 60 and now we've got the clock so I mean again I'm not suggesting this is a beautiful or interesting or wonderful clock in any way whatsoever what I'm doing is showing you that you can get the time information and you can map it to some kind of design system this is a triedandtrue kind of interesting exercise you can actually do this without knowing a lot about programming if you notice how to draw shapes and how to manipulate numbers that's really all you need for this the second hour and the minute function so I hope that everybody will try to make their own clock I'll try to think of an interesting way for to compile all these I don't know how to do that you got make out like a code pen thing the template I don't know so I share them with me in the comments on github and timeout coming up so actually zero point oh one two three sixty would be best I'm gonna leave it I'm gonna leave it at this should have the whole circle reduce after a minute is up and alternate yeah definitely people are giving me ad tix to prove your hypothesis if they align with the expected result fine I'm just reading the chat now to see if I should do anything else it does do something a little bit weird I probably should have just made I probably should just made like the minute hands and stuff so let me do that so this this coding challenge was about to end and I actually just wrapped up but I'm going to keep going actually cuz there's a lively discussion in the chat let's just sort of I don't know why what I probably should have done is just make a literal clock with minute second and our hands let's do that for a second let's actually put those lines there and see if this kind of maps with what we think it should be so I am going to in addition to drawing these arcs I'm going to draw a line I'm just going to do the second hand for a second from 0 0 to 100 comma 0 and I'm going to give it a stroke of 255 so I'm drawing this line straight up now I want that line to rotate according to that end angle and I'm gonna need to put push and pop around it because that rotation should only affect that line not the arcs so now we can see that is the actual second hand and while I'm letting that run for a little bit I'm going to and I'm just gonna put these at the end I should put this like I should this should be called I'm really second angle oh shoot I just lost my copy paste so I'm gonna do this here so this should be called this should be called second angle if I'm being worrier about this this should be called minute angle and this should be called hour angle if I want to be a bit more thoughtful second angle minute angle and now what I'm going to do is make these lines and I'm gonna do a second angle and I'm going to do a minute angle and hour angle and I'll make the minute 75 and the hour 50 and here we go so again I could be this is right now right it is now well okay I need these to be different colors is that that doesn't look right all right it's the minute angle number of minutes let's make this let's use the same colors I don't know why I put it down there now this is silly of me to separate these things that's the minute angle this is the hour up whoops this is the hour color and this is the second color I should draw a point in the middle that would be helpful and then let's also at the end just say stroke 255 point zero zero so there should be a nice little dot in the middle there we go so yeah this is the minute looks wrong you did something wrong with the minute six is right for the hour this seems reasonable for the seconds and then I must have messed something up about the minute minute from 0 to N equals minute let minute equal minute zero to 60 zero to 360 let's look at 26 so why is the purple minute pointing up so let's look at console.log minute angle it's always 360 so console dot log minute 26 0 what did I miss here oh I forgot oh look at this horrible typo I'm staring at it I should never do coding challenges after hours and hours of live streaming this I'm like I'd like three and a half hours of live streaming I just lost the word map there by accident there we go this is our clock oh it makes me happy that is actually kind of a nice looking clock and I don't know why I got distracted by this Ark thing if I were to just comment out the Ark's just for a second here this is the basic items this is the basic idea of making a clock so I have now made a clock in p5 in JavaScript but the point of me showing you is the arc and again it was not very creative is not very exciting that you can now take this basic idea of the code are and reading seconds minutes and hours from the p5 functions and drawing to your heart's content the most creative strange way look at the jaw my two clocks look at there's an the lecture by goal on Levin that I will include as a link in this video's description and look at the sum of the clock examples from alka and other users that also link from code pen and hold on so I want to check I don't know if one thing I think you mean interesting projects is porting all of John mydas original clocks from the 12 o'clock series if this is a loud thing to do to a p5 gs2 like allow those projects to live on and for people to see them in the browser and they're beautiful and interesting experiments so thanks for everyone for tuning in to this coding challenge I can't wait to see all the clocks that people make I will create a github page where you can submit them and there'll be a link to that in the video's description but you can also tweet me at Schiffman with your clocks or just write them in the comments and I'll to see them that way thanks for watching how did i do today everybody for my 100th livestream I think I unplugged something alright so I've got to go but I said I was gonna read 100 random numbers for today's 100th livestream so why is my music not working oh it is working alright everybody you should all leave now nobody wants nobody wants to listen to this but for the 100th livestream I am going to read oh I'll read page 100 let's do that yeah I'm gonna just check this slack chat thank you for all that we chat I should read the chat I'm looking for page 100 from the coding train storybook this live a heavy book I know I broke this wrist too by the way so the left isn't exactly didn't have to have surgery on you thankfully it's mostly healed foot so actually I can I know that this there's a very easy way for me to figure out what's 100 random numbers so each row here is 1 2 3 4 oh no this is the row number that's not the number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 each page so each page is 100 numbers I'm gonna give myself 100 seconds oh no there's no way I can read a number a second yeah you mean that could I could read a number a second I'm gonna give myself one hundreds I should program my own timer 100 seconds is one minute 40 seconds I'm gonna give myself one minute 40 seconds the lullaby song is one minute that's no good that's fine I'm gonna get myself one seconds to read 100 numbers from I know Eric okay my timer from page 100 of a million random digits those of you who stayed all the way through this what is now probably I started this that was more like four o'clock this is only been two and a half hours here we go make this full screen right I'm not crazy one minute is 60 seconds 40 60 plus 40 is 100 and here we go 92108 77,000 033 sixtyeight thousand three and twenty five to ten thousand won or sixty thirty eight thousand six seven sixty thousand forty one ace eighty seven oh two three wait wait hold on after restart we said this do I have to say do I have to say the do I have to say the like this that's should I just read it as a 9 3 108 drive to say ninety three thousand one hundred and eight I think I've have to say that thousand there's no way I could say 93 108 seven seven zero seven seven zero three three I think that's what I'm gonna do that's what I'm gonna do right right that's fine that was one point five okay here we go can I loop wait how do I loop my sound effects there's gotta be a way to loop it whatever I'm not gonna worry about that the lullaby will stop in the middle of I doesn't really work for this it needs to be something much more like 91 or eight seven seven zero three three six eight three to five 101 six zero six eight seven six two four four one eight seven two zero two three nine four three seven two zero six one six fours three zero seven zero zero two eight two seven one zero eight five eight nine eight three two seven nine four eight eight three eight six zero nine three five seven zero five four one five three eight one four nine five five five eight zero eight five three two eight zero two three five two one the thing is you just don't even know that I'm messing up does anybody have this book because I just like totally misread a bunch of the numbers hundred minutes I know I don't like rushing these numbers really need the amount of time that they need this one hundred thing gone too far 92108 77033 sixtyeight thousand three hundred twentyfive ten thousand one hundred

eight hundred forty three forty four thousand eight hundred ninety five we should go home for dinner twenty two thousand twenty five that was thirty numbers by the way so far son I'm getting there what we'll wait a second ten wait a second no no no no no no no I lost my mind I totally lost my mind I'm the worst at math it's worse than anybody in the entire world we have to read to hear one two three four five six seven eight nine ten I have to read the whole page one two three four five six seven eight nine ten I was like I was halfway done the whole page is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten is fifty fifty rows of ten 500 500 per page I'm so close to being done I know two throws anybody know the last number I read somebody help me with the last number I read yeah by the way I'm definitely gonna make an audiobook of this and sell it become very original just write a texttospeech program that doesn't 34 something 34 something I'd like to know what the last number I read is do I need maybe I need to start over to I need to start over because it needs to be like continuous nobody will tell me the last number it's 80 something 3480 something nobody can scroll back in time and tell me can't you do that 88 something doesn't this fancy internet livestreaming thing to like allow people to go back in time eightyeight thousand 34 I'm getting twenty two thousand twenty five I'm getting a bunch of different numbers I think eighty eight thousand 34 by the way I have terrible vision this is like very hard for me to read 88,000 there is no 88,000 34 that I can find I think I bet I think just better start over better start over it's not that much to read oh people are say 22,000 25 okay I'm getting that from some reliable sources problem is that I read the correct number 22,000 there's a twenty thousand six hundred four 22 does anybody have a copy of this book Oh twenty thousand twentyfive pound it okay so I read twenty two thousand twenty five yes

hundred and fortysix eightysix thousand and four hundred twentynine thousand five hundred fiftynine thank you all for tuning in to this week's the coding train and all of the stuff that we messed up and couldn't possibly do checking like Twitter messages one more time I don't have a message so I anybody who wants to uh I don't know if much uh if you want to edit that anybody wants to remix that in some interesting way that would make me so happy musical music video level by going to sleep thanks everyone for watching I hope some of the stuff that I did today was useful and helpful and it wasn't too much of a mess I just mess up too many times and that you're all not staying up too far past your bedtime I am very late to get home it is now 640 and I am going to leave now so thank you this was the live stream 100 Phoenix and the chat is asking when is the next livestream so I'm trying to consistently livestream every Friday afternoon so any check Friday morning bye and when I'm going to give the times and getting you Eastern Eastern Time New York City time so usually by twelve o'clock that day I'll schedule the exact time typically I would start some the earliest I would start would probably be two o'clock the latest I was starting to be four or five o'clock and then every once awhile on a Friday I might even do it earlier in the day for because I know there's a lot of international folks were this livestream is in the middle tonight for them but so I try to find a twohour pocket of time every Friday that I'm available I should really just do it same time every week really look about over apologizing for this good lens so neurotic about not having an exact time so yes so next Friday I don't think there's a couple Fridays in that Ole Miss I will get back to the machine learning stuff and I wanted to do I want to do something on quadtrees was kind of like in my mind is like that's kind of important I didn't do the custom shapes so I know so I'll come back next week and that'll be that everybody's giving me all these like improvement you could increase minutes counter by 160 at each second and mod by 60 same for hour yes so all these wonderful suggestions for improvements the clock are excellent suggestions I hope that you will all write these into the comments and make your own version of the clocks and share those so that everybody can learn from everybody else my clock will live on as it's just sort of is alright well if somebody from what time is it in Australia alright people are tweeting at me I'm looking at my phone I gotta go thank you everybody I don't know so this is the archive of this whole live stream will be available at some point I might have to we'll see whether it needs to be restated put back together or whether it can try to live just the the video but and I will post the source code for the clock I'll try to do it tonight or tomorrow it just tweeted me at Schiffman or if anybody like kind of followed along and wants to pull request it to the code what so this would be so helpful for me I mean it's easier for me to do it cuz I got the code on the computer but if anybody wants to really help me out something that's really really useful for me is coding train rainbow code this is the github repository where I keep track of all of the code for all of the coding challenges and people have suggested ways of improving the way this is organized there might be code that's missing so if you want to help me with this and the simplest thing would just be that was coding challenge I guess number 74 so you could pull requests CC underscore 74 underscore clock as a folder and pull request the code there I would love that and I'm trying to use read Me's and keep track of all the links to everything and have stuff running online but if you have any ideas I would love to totally like redo this as like an exciting coding train website with all the examples running the browser and code but I'm that's never gonna happen almost like it help with that so that's a community project in addition to making all of your clocks alright quaternions a Bezier curve you can you learning made your choice regions all these I don't know
