in this video I'm here to look at something new something kind of exciting to me which is and let me just demonstrate it for you first what I have here right over here is a html5 canvas it's using something called p5.js and I can move my mouse around it and I can click and draw on that canvas but look what happens when I do that when I click and draw on that canvas there's another canvas over here where that same drawing appears and if I come over here and I draw here something in this canvas appears and you can see the color is inverted now this might not seem so magical to you but I I'm making the case to you that these two browser windows with these two canvases could be on separate computers in separate parts of the world so what I'm here to demonstrate to you today in a series of short tutorial videos is how to use serverside programming with your p5.js creative sketch to allow for realtime communication between multiple users of your sketch so this could be used for playing a game or a collaborative something or other you could have video also there's lots of possibilities of things you could do but I'm going to demonstrate it with a basic collaborative shared drawing space so I have we have to add if you're coming to this video having only ever done the basics of programming in JavaScript with p5.js you're in the right place we're going to add something to this which is serverside programming with nodejs now if you've watched any of my videos I have done some stuff about node in some videos about making Twitter BOTS we're going to do something slightly different with node here and I'm gonna start a bit from scratch again so let's um let me talk about what the pieces of this are so for example the idea here is that you have a laptop and that laptop has a browser window with a canvas that you're drawing in and somewhere else in some other part of the world there is another laptop with that canvas and with this canvas and as you draw that same drawing appears over there so somewhere else there needs to be a server what happens is this particular instance of your p5.js sketch talks to that server with something known as a socket socket being a real time connection between two applications that can send data back and forth this particular client also talks to that server we have a socket so that when the user moves the mouse and event is triggered where the X and y coordinate of the mouse is sent to the server the server sends the X and y coordinate of that mouse back to this other one and then this other one receives that message and draws so the issue is you we know how to write a JavaScript program or you move the mouse and you draw stuff that's what's the thing that's happening over here what maybe we don't know how to do what I haven't covered in any of my videos before is how to write this server program and the platform that I'll write the server program in is something called nodejs there are lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of different ways and languages and frameworks and things you could do serverside programming with building big giant web applications is a huge massive scary weird but not foot friendly a nice topic way beyond the scope of what I'm doing here what I want to do is just look at a simple framework node which will allow me to host the files the p5.js sketch as well as make those socket connections so this is the basic sketch of what I want to do and so the first thing I need to show you how to do is download node install node and run something in node and then get two more after I do that questions you can't ask a question because this is a video but but but uh but it's find me somewhere okay so I'm back over here I'm going to close here's my computer I'm going to close this and I'm going to close this and I'll look where I am I am here on the node J s website so if you go to node J s dot org for quick access place your book works for your blah blah blah I'm download your appropriate version of node run the Installer you can see that I'm doing it here on Mac on a Mac operating system and apple operating system OS X I've downloaded I've installed it once you've done that you should be able to go to a command line view of your computer now on the map the easiest way to do this is with an application called terminal which looks like this and it's usually found in applications utilities on windows insert annotation here which will say the thing you should use on Windows and whoops you can see yeah that I already have a terminal open and we see it it looks something like this and I'm going to make the font bigger but I'm not prepared for this video I'm going to make the font bigger so you can see it better so this is come back to me computer this is a terminal window and terminal window is a place where you can type all sorts of commands in now I'm going to leave but uh you know someday I should make just like introduction to terminal and unix commands type thing but right now i'm just going to give you some basic stuff that you need to know the first thing you want to do it realize is that if you've installed node properly you can just type the word node into terminal and hit run and hit run hit enter and then suddenly you see this other line strangely enough this is now a place where I can type JavaScript like a good say 5 plus 6 equals 11 or I could say VAR x equals 100 and then I could say X plus plus and then I could say X is now 101 somehow I meant to say x equals x plus but but anyway no no X plus plus C yeah I digress the point is I'm somehow now in JavaScript land in terminal but this is not really what I want to do what I really want to do is write JavaScript programs in a text editor that I can trigger from from this node command in terminal and I and I and I I forgot something important over here which is to say that the point of all this is this might be ultimately how you eventually want your application to live a server somewhere in the internet clients all over the world connecting to that server but what I'm doing right now and if you're falling along and doing it too is running all of these pieces on one single machine so I'm going to run the server on my laptop using node I'm going to run the client in the browser on my laptop I'm going to run another client in a separate browser window on my laptop just for testing and making sure it all works ok so over here one of the commands that I control C by the way is how you a clear will get me back up to the top one of the commands that's really important that I want to use is CD for change directory and I want to go to a folder where I have some p5.js files because eventually I'm going to be using a p5.js sketch in connection with what I'm doing so I want to go there and then I'm going to go to the finder and I'm going to go to my desktop because I already made a folder on my desktop called sockets coding rainbow and the only thing in that folder is just kind of like the stuff that you would have for a p5.js sketch an HTML file a sketch das file a libraries folder so if you're trying to follow along you'll pause the video now get yourself a folder with the stuff that you would have with a p5.js sketch in there and then you could keep going so what I want what I can do is when I type cd' is I can take this folder and drag it into terminal and you can see now this is the full path to that directory users slash processing slash desktop slash sockets coding rainbow so if I hit enter I am now in that directory another command that I could type is LS I can see that's listing all the files that are in that directory and in fact I already have hopefully a text editor open to that directory right here you can see because what I want to do in this directory is now make a new file I want to make a file and I'm going to call it a server dot J s notice I now have a new text file called server J s I'm going to open that up and I'm going to just say something like console dot log my socket server is running so here's the magic of node node is a JavaScript program that you can execute from the command line it doesn't involve a browser it doesn't involve a window graphics I mean all those things are possible in this rule and scape of things you might do but this program now that has one line of code in it I can go back to terminal and I can say node server dot Jas I can hit enter and I can see that my socket server is running now my socket server is not running because I don't have any of the code for the socket server here so this is what I'm going to get into in the next video so what if you're following along what you should have now in your head is a general sense of what is going on serverside programming with nodejs conveniently by the way one of the reasons why I picked nodejs is because it's JavaScript so you don't have to learn a new programming language so serverside program with no dot yes you've got that installed on your laptop you've got the idea of making a p5.js sketch so and then you have a directory that has both a node program in it under sketch jas and your p5.js i'm sorry under server touches and your p5.js files and once you have that maybe put some test code in server j/s run that test code you've got node running you've got your p5 chess MTP 5 GS sketch ready to go and you'll be ready for the next step which is starting to add the actual code for the socket server
