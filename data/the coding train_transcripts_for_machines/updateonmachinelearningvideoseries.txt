hello I'm here I am here mostly to apologize please stop don't throw the tomatoes the green wall will have Tomatoes flats on them but I'm here just to give a quick update about the my machine learning videos that I have a playlist called ten neural networks the nature of code I was making these videos over the summer then I had this moment where I was like riding along on a bicycle and I was thinking way too much about machine learning I had a bump fell over I broke my elbow I had surgery on it twice I lost a couple months of like being able to make content and then the fall started so unfortunately I was in the middle of this series I was at ten point seven I had made seven videos that's crazy and every time I upload a video now comments asking could I please continue that series and I am planning to continue it what I do here on the coding train is I make videos about stuff that I'm currently teaching at my fulltime job here at New York University and currently what I'm teaching is an introduction to programming course and of course about text analysis so I am going to be making some videos about chatbots which is kind of adjacent to a machine learning can be a tool to drive a chatbot I'm also gonna make some videos about hopefully long term short long short term I can't remember I don't have long or short term memory but some of these recurrent neural networks for text generation and then I my hope is that I will be coming back to this playlist again after this semester is over or towards the end of the semester if I finished up some of the content so in the meantime I hope to continue to have some github repositories where I'm gonna be making some new examples so stay in touch with me on Twitter and I would recommend to you well as you've seen as a guest on my channel Suraj has a channel about deep learning and also this is a new video that just came out from one of my favorite channels three blue one Brown but what is a neural network deep learning part one so now we have an internet competition we'll deep learning part to come out before 10.8 the answer is almost a definite yes so please write all of your complaints in the comments here I'm going to read them I'm going to sit with some sort of like meditative cucumber eye mask thing on and I'm going to listen to all of your feedback about why I should do this right now instead of the other stuff that I'm doing now and then I will feel guilty for a while and then eventually these videos will come out okay so thanks for watching this short little video explanation and I'll see you soon
