hi so what I want to look at in this video is two other elements that you can add to a page for additional interactivity so uh the previous video I started talking about this idea of a call back you have a button and you attach a function to that button and the code is executed only when you click on the button via uh the mous Pressed event call back so let's look at two other pieces of of two other interactive elements you can add to the page and how what other events might be associated with those elements and some other things you might be able to do that'll just make things more interesting for you so hopefully I'm not going to like knock this light over and start a fire and there was a siren earlier and you know the fire department will come but everything's okay still for right now okay so the two elements are let's start with a slider so a slider is something that looks like this my beautiful drawing of a slider you can slide this value slide this little dot back and forth and hopefully control something on the page making something larger making something smaller making something more blue less blue how does that work so the P5 function for adding a slider to a page this is create slider now there's a few things to mention about this number one this is the default HTML slider element so it's what you get for free in the browser a slider's just there if you want to have your own kind of slider that looks custom if you want to make your slider along a sine wave there's all sorts of crazy things you can do in canvas and drawing and we've sort of seen that but right now we just going to work with the default slider you get for free the other thing I want to mention is you can of course add the slider by writing the HTML tags into the htl source itself and there might be good reasons for doing that but for Simplicity right now I'm kind of focusing on JavaScript and I want to just add the slider using Create slider just like I said create button now what does a slider need a slider needs three three values to start it needs a minimum what is the value that the slider should output when it SL when you slide all the way to the left what is the maximum when you slide all the way to the right and what is what I would say the starting value so let's say that I want to use the slider to control the size of a circle and I want the circle size to be between 10 and 100 and I want it to start at 47 so create slider with a minimum with a maximum and with a starting value so let's add that to the page I'm going to come over here and um we can see I already have a button and now I'm going to add a slider create slider with a minimum a maximum and a starting value so we should see now that there is also a slider on the Page by the way one thing I did which is kind of silly is was bothered me that the button was showing up to the right of the canvas later I will show you all sorts of other ways through CSS and styling to control the layout of the page but right now uh as a quick sort of trick is I just added a parag an empty paragraph between the canvas and the button and you can see how I did that in the code right here so I made the canvas I made an empty paragraph and then I put the button you can see the slider is showing up to the right of the button if I added another empty paragraph it would show up below you know whether it was that's a good idea or a bad idea I'm sure lots of people will tell me that that was a terrible idea but you know what it works it's fine okay so now the slider is there I can move it around nothing is happening but you notice also I could change this like if I say the starting value is five you can see look the slider position started over here if I say the starting value is 86 the slider position starts over here so you can control that starting value by uh changing the number hardcoded in the code so how do you get the value out of the slider and the way that you get the value out of the slider is a function called value so this is another function that we're adding that I'm that that I'm this is another function that I'm telling you about that is part of HTML elements so far we've only seen position which absolute position is an element on the page I've shown you HTML the HTML function which changes the content of the element what's the text in the element and now you're seeing another one value which pulls out the value now value is not necessarily relevant for a lot of other uh for for all elements but s value is relevant for a slider because you need to know the current value of the slider so let's say where where might I use this ah so first of all what did I forget I just made the slider but if I want to pull the value if I want to position it change its content pull out the value I need a variable to call that function on so I need to add a variable slider here then I can say slider equals create slider and now anywhere in the code I could access its value so I want to change this to a circle and you can see there's a circle and I'm going to say slider. value in here in slider. val now you might ask the question is don't I want an event like I want to have an event fire I want to handle the event anytime the user moves the slider and this is something you actually can do and I I'll show that to you hopefully in this video in a little bit later but I've done a little bit of a trick here remember draw this animation Loop is just cycling over and over again draw draw draw loop loop loop so what I can do instead of handling the event I could just say while I'm drawing that Circle every time I draw the circle access the value of the slider for the size of the circle and you can see here now that I move the slider you can see the the size of that circle is changing so this is yet another thing you can add to your code you can have a button here now I have a button that handles an event I have a slider where I'm pulling the value continuously and draw and so I'm essentially building a little interface to control the canvas so this is kind of what I think you can start doing now if you've learned a bit about programming and you're making these little pictures the animations what might you get out of building a simple interface controlling things in the code with a button controlling things in the code with a slider and even more so let's look at one more element a text input field and this is where I'm going to get to some other events which I think are useful to see uh I'm erasing all this so a text input field is a box where a user can type in text like their name so you might say like Name colon an empty Fields so how would you how do you get this on the page create input the create input function creates a text input field on the page so let's add that over here I'm going to add that under slider and you know what I'm going to just be smarter about this and just add a variable input equals create input now let's put something in here in the quotes here name type your name let's run that and see what happens now notice interestingly enough I can populate that text input field in advance by passing an argument to the create input function so whatever right and this is this is sort of a a key piece of information here I'm having trouble with my layout of my window here but you can see that creating different elements requires different arguments a button the text goes inside the button a slider needs a minimum maximum starting value a text input field needs text to start in that input field if I wanted it to be blank I could just take this out and start it with an empty string and you can see that text input field is blank but I'll give it like you know I'm going to write test name you know I'll put that type your name back in here and you can see there it is so now how do I get what the current text is in that box um how do I get that into um How do I access that well guess what I erased it but I wrote down here before the value function the value function pulls out the current value of the slider the numeric value of where the slider is the value function pulls out the current value also of a text input box so this is a sort of important function if I have a an element a text input field a slider and I want to know its current value this P5 Dom Library function value will give me access to that so I can do something like uh here in canvas there is a text function I'm going to say text uh uh let's just test that this works hello uh 10 comma 20 and I'm going to run this and you can see there it is the word hello is on the canvas but now what if I were to say instead input. value so just like I'm using the slide 's value to draw a to set the size of a circle I'm going use the text inputs value to set text that I'm drawing on the canvas so look at this oh look at this it says type your name and now here Daniel schiffman wow this is amazing whatever I type so this is pretty great so you can dynamically access what's in the box through the value function and control to the canvas now I think we better I think we should do something different here so this is great you can see how the all three of these elements work a button click on the button make an event happen click on the slider use the variable use the value of the slider in a variable to control something in the code Type some stuff here change what appears on this in the canvas but I want to do something different what I want to do now is I'm going to go back to this paragraph element and I'm going to say D um your name now look at this this what I want to see is when I'm typing here when I hit enter I want to see that the sorry this paragraph changed to my name okay so what I want to do is not just control something in the canvas I want to control another HTML element from and I'm I'm kind of gone to M my 10minute Mark here but maybe you're still watching I want to control another element uh uh from from that text input field so let's think about how that works so a quick way that I could do it um sorry we've we've already sort of seen this so let me just come back here and say uh name p and I'm going to say this is name p and in draw I could say name p. HTML input. Val so this is right here right this text function draws text to the canvas this HTML function changes the text of an HTML element to that value so now if I run this you can see here that you know whatever I type here changes in this element but I'm actually only using the uh the fact that draw is looping so actually I think I'm going to stop this and do a I'm going to just continue this discussion in the next video because I think we could look at the difference between um how some of these other events are handled uh we look at a selection of other events um and so I'm going to do that in the next video um but uh uh if so if you're if you're watching this video and stopping here right now what I might suggest that you do is try adding a slider a bunch of Sliders try adding a text field see can you make the can you make the the this text update in the canvas only when you click like a submit button so how what kind of interplay can you have between buttons sliders text fields and Dom elements and in the next video I want to look at other events besides just Mouse press that might be associated with these uh elements okay I'm going to hit uh stop
