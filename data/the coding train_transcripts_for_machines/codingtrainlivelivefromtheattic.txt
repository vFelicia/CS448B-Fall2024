so good morning uh i am doing a quick audio sound check uh let me know in the chat if you can hear me okay you probably all well there's music playing let me pause for a second so this is now me just talking without the music you probably hear a little white noise which is the fan that i have going there's no ac up here in the uh attic where i am but it is quite warm all right let me know how this sounds do do do hmm do good morning welcome to the coding train from yet another studio location i have been moving and moving and having trying to stream from here and there and everywhere although very very little in the last month because i believe if you go back and look at the calendar and i'm just checking to see that my audio is working and there's a picture of me on my monitor over here that the last time i live streamed it was definitely the month of july um and it was towards the end of july it might have been something like july 22nd but i am back to what i hope might actually be a regular weekly saturday morning at exactly this time it's morning for me 10 a.m live stream so um i've got a lot of new stuff here in my setup but first i've gotta i've gotta admit some i've gotta i've got a confession i mean this is not too unusual for a coding train live stream the confession that i have i have but it's it's just much more extreme at this moment than it usually is i have no plan for today whatsoever not even like here's a mental list of a few things i want to make sure i say and then i don't have a plan i just have no plan so whatever is coming out of my mouth talking to you right now is just whatever i'm happening to think of of the moment but i really wanted to make sure that i came and that i um turned the buttons on to live stream to really get back into the habit of it because to be honest it was a bit of a struggle for me i meant to do this last week there's a lot of complexity going on in everyone's life mine is no exception um i'm i'm i'm in a very like lucky and privileged situation in many ways that i have a lot of things easy but just figuring out how to kind of get over that hump and back to uh being with you the people of the internet uh the coding train passengers if you will um and i really missed that and i wanted to uh just kind of rip off the bandaid and be back here so here i am what's next anything you do will be good says uh amannaski uh glad to see you hello there says andy uh joshua says we love having you back okay so this is helping it's nice to see these nice comments in the youtube uh chat so um oh code garden is here just wing it uh k weekman who by the way even though like i know your full name i can never refer to k weekman as anything other than gay week also i'm slightly afraid i'm going to mispronounce your first name because um i know there are different pronunciations of it alka says hello um and so uh glauco sends me a nice lovely little super chat there miss you pal welcome back so um so maybe this wasn't entirely true because i do have a bit of a plan for today my only plan the thing that i thought of as i was frantically this morning like plugging in all the wires and cables was to let me get organized for this fall i did this at the beginning of the summer uh i think probably in may and um let me pull that up here for a second um and while i'm here i just want to thank the sponsor for today's live stream if my buttons will work uh brilliant brilliant is a wonderful website for learning and interactive learning and exercises it's like so related to everything that i do on this channel so you can check it out at brilliant.org codingtrain i'll come and look at some of their courses uh later when i take a break um all right let me um pull open my web browser here uh and i will be i'm gonna try to pay a little more attention to the chat than i usually do um those of you who happen to be coding train members and are in both the youtube chat and the discord member live stream chat if you see a really um what you view as a meaningful or important or interesting question you could repost it for me um and i know simon if simon's watching simon has a whole discord bot q a bot system i don't know if we're prepared to use that today but um that would be helpful for me um if you want to um to uh um help me with any of the pulling out interesting questions but i am keeping my i have a one thing that i have is really exciting i can't talk too much about it because i have to i can't i have a new monitor and it's a 34 inch wide monitor so it's like uh i really want to show data i've got like open broadcast studio over here i've got the youtube chat here i've got the discord chat here i've got the youtube console here uh when i talk about brilliant i have some notes that i can just like pull up so there's like so much screen space for me it's very exciting uh let me go here to late night this is not coming up why why does the computer not know just to type whatever i wanted to type is it this brilliant okay ah sponsored by brilliant okay um so uh moving down along here for a second by the way oh my green my key is a little bit off you can see that right the light is different so i spent a lot of time working on the key uh for the green screen the other day uh because i in a new setup i've got the green screen here but um apparently the lighting you know in this attic where i kind of show you maybe you could see it in my youtube story i took a picture i know i'm this is going to be the day the live stream of tangents as well um can you see stories channel stories on um um just through the web interface it doesn't appear like where are my stories community i guess i have to go to uh no oh well if you look at my um youtube stories you can see i'm like an old fogie who doesn't know how to use the internet there's no tick tock coming there's no coding trading tick tock coming if anybody wants to be the official coding train on tick tock representative you know maybe we could uh reach a whole new audience there but i don't think it's going to be me although i do like to dance and i hear that's a thing i see sudoku generator visit here to see your dance now i know you didn't even hear me say that already because you're way behind so the other thing that's amazing to me is i am live streaming from my attic over wifi i didn't think that would be possible but the quality so i hear is just fine where was i what was i i was trying to find a picture of my attic okay never mind um so these this was a list of things i made earlier this summer um nothing's checked off that's horrible was there a different list i remember checking things off at some point uh to sort of keep track of some projects that i was working on oh i think i made some notes on a whiteboard at some point um so i did a bunch of these things um let me check them and read me noah um am i logged in yeah i probably have to edit it um but um so this is one of the things that i want to do today is really get organized for um this fall i don't know if david if david is watching i definitely want to look at a few um i see david in the chat look at a few community contributions i'll probably start with that so i think i can pull up the link for that um and i can talk about how um you can get involved with the coding train community cloned 81 asks how will i ever learn javascript there's so much to learn where to start oh so first when it's time for you to learn javascript you want to sit down at your desk pull out a sheet of paper that's just full of random digits you always got to have one handy with you mine is the piece of paper that fell out of my brandon pigeon's book take a deep breath put on some nice soothing music and read from your random numbers a little random number asmr here because i have a new microphone okay here we go 86 789 9687 7986 47 0002 13 014 63 742 2099 75 820. my bald spot is so visible right now did i have that does anybody know that you said that like in the 80s you would see the late night commercial for like the sprayon hair i could just sort of spray it on i think i might need that everybody always says i look so much younger don't think that's so true anymore with this high definition super amazing camera i have here 82 04. oh i love live streaming on this like this like fulfills me to know unfortunately you can see that my camera green screen doesn't actually fill up the screen uh i i i get a tremendous amount of happiness and joy this is really where i am in brooklyn new york in an attic with like a tremendous amount of expensive computer equipment a fan a page of random numbers and 574 people are here with me it's just amazing please do a factorial code tutorial on processing i like that idea ah simon oh simon everybody should know simon simon is probably one of the most loyal viewers of the coding train simon is a young a young person a young human who loves to code has his own youtube channel uh simon is always making stuff for the coding train contributing and i'm always behind i always haven't caught the last thing i haven't looked at the last thing and i apologize simon um did you see the mega fave numbers playlist on youtube i don't know what that is i have not seen the mega fave i think i better turn this off i have not seen that um if somebody wants to send me a link ah and it's a get github an issue on the website so let's move to the hey everybody it's time for your favorite segment on the coding trains with your host me the conductor of the trade all aboard today this segment is we're gonna look at your code and your community contributions i'm gonna just get my fancy fingers here type it into my keyboard press my magic button here and we're gonna go to the issues tab and somewhere here wheel link by gypsy dangerous gypsy dangerous viewer of the coding train uh thank you for making this beautiful wheel spinner so what this wheel spinner does uh basically um if you don't know uh if you go to thecodingtrain.com and any of the pages here like if i go right to this most recent coding in the cabana video on marching squares if i click on uh this button here i will get to the page that has a million links to every single possible version of code uh that i demonstrate in the video wow look at that uh and then it has a list of community contributions here so you can have your uh project listed here it's a wonderful way to share your work with the community i tend to i love to like click through and find them i actually often show these to students in my classes that i teach uh at new york university um and then there's a link down here at the below which you can add your own version so all of this happens through um this weird little thing here that's in the corner right here is where is the microphone i feel like it either needs to be like much more visible there we go or not visible at all let's try that um that messed up the sound let me know uh so what was i saying ah so uh the the methodology for adding your link to the webpage is by making a pull request on github and i um i have a video tutorial about that that i'm sure if you search coding train pull request will come up but we also have a um a page here that gives you instructions specifically for this page with a little look how crazy i look there different glasses uh different hair i cleaned myself up by the way i i don't know if there's any photos of me on the internet anywhere from like two weeks ago i mean i i could show you but i i hadn't trimmed my beard or cut my hair in like month it was like crazy so uh maybe i'll someone can remind me i can share that with you sound is actually better it's a solar liner amazing um so uh i encourage you to uh to submit your project through this method we the the community is very friendly and helpful um you can also join the discord i definitely want to spend some time talking about this i would like to ramp up the discord this fall that's kind of a goal of mine because on my agenda and i've got to give a huge shout out to coding garden with cj who's in the chat um on my agenda for this fall is a series of stepbystep discord bot tutorials um it's for the course that i'm teaching at nyu so i've got to make those videos on the coding train to release to the world and use them in my course so i want to do a lot more with discord this fall um all right but we have a a redundant system it'd be nice to automate this in some fancy way but david snyder uh gypsy dangerous um was generous enough to and um david apologies if other people helped you with this i'm not crediting everyone but uh you feel free to let me know in the chat um happy international programmers day is that really true i want to be able to say that as many languages as possible my microphone is positioned wrong you need to tilt it back i'm afraid to mess with it too much as soon as i touch the microphone it's like this usb i need to get a new cord for it uh it keeps cutting i'm not touching it anymore i'm not touching it sorry about that uh sorry about that audio problem the day of the uh okay breaking news everybody is this it breaking news here on the coding train from w oh and arnov has joined a car breaking four breaking news oh no no wrong one that's not right where welcome to the coding train you have just boarded the train as a passenger on the coding train thank you for your support with your membership of the coding train you will receive your very own random number we must get the random number book 28 461. oh my goodness and daniel granger welcome daniel granger you have boarded the coding train with your membership of the coding train you will get me to waste more time not actually coding on the coding train by just playing buttons here and talking incessantly i don't know why you're all watching this please go all out with your day seriously this is nonsense but i'll give you your random number oh you're getting a gaussian deviate i don't know about this daniel 1.137 all right i'm new to the channel can you give an introduction oh you mean this doesn't just like uh make sense to you like what this channel is i can do that that's actually probably a good idea it's been so long since i've live streamed i'm new to the channel oh whoa the focus just went a little crazy there all right so but i was on a path i was gonna spin the wheel the magical wheel of wonderfulness let's introduce the channel to our new viewer who what's the new viewer's name um what's the new viewer's name that said uh i'm new to the channel okay weekman's passed me that uh i would love to know 100 emoji by the way it's very important that um you always keep like a geometry reference near you and i just want to show you mine this is my i guess i should switch to here this is my wonderful uh geometry mug which i actually purchased in bletchley park uh in the uk i bought this mug made it all the way back here it gives me my mathematical formulas i have coffee in it which is probably not something i should be allowed to drink but you know by the way one thing that i love about live streaming at home is i feel much more free to be completely insane because like when i was live streaming in a studio at nyu i felt like you know somebody might listen i had to like have some sort of semblance of professionalism and that's actually one of the big things i want to talk about how i'm intending to be a little bit more clear about how i'm separating the tutorial content that is more curriculum based and it's not really like serious academic stuff but um and the sort of live stream nonsense all right uh it was uh and thank you bren brassad for your super chat this is all too kind of all of you um venkat gudevillum is new to the channel all right so and by the way this live stream is gonna go until noon so i do have to turn it off at noon at noon my children will be up here like yelling at me because the one thing about this new monitor and pc streaming setup that i have is uh they like kids are nine and twelve and they discovered that it's the best gaming setup and they've discovered this game called fall guys i think that they love play it on steam not a sponsor but hey i'm available um and they actually want to live stream it won't be through the coding train but um if you're in join the discord i'll post a link afterwards if you want to join us this afternoon um playing some fall guys i think that's the name of the game mostly they play roblox and we've been doing a little four range roblox programming ah introduce the channel can you please get deep you're all i mean i can't i can't keep a thought together oh i think we ah we might need some random number reading again i wish gloria my my puppers would show up oh my goodness welcome kush thank you for boarding the coding train as a member you're all passengers you're all with me here on the coding train i love you all equally except for the ones who join as members that i love just like a tiny bit more no no no you're all wonderful i'm just joking oh this is all so silly let's give you your random number seventy one thousand one hundred and ninety thank you very much there we go okay uh so introduction to the coding train then community contributions so this is uh my youtube channel this is a fun i i really hesitate to show this because but i think people will enjoy seeing this i got uh one of those like gold play buttons which is very exciting uh and fun and i have it here uh you can see this this is the coding grid oh my goodness please stop joining already welcome charlie england to the coding thing you are a new passenger recording this morning and uh welcome uh i i usually say a bunch of nonsense and some stick and i've forgotten about it and there's only 10 seconds left so i'm gonna give you your random number please i hope you're all noting these down because i'm not and uh 39 39 403 maybe i can do something with the rewards where when i end up sending people their custom uh train whistles you get your own random number like inscribed on today you guys are talking welcome to sa makwanzi welcome to passengers you've booked the coding train i'm really out of things to say i i need to take like an improv class or something like this is not i was not i'm like just here to make some javascript tutorials not to do this stuff i gotta take a nap i'm so tired all of a sudden up and your red number is 59 745 all right please take a break from joining people okay so the coding train is a youtube channel um and i started it let's so let's talk a little bit about the history of things so i i started making videos i think they still exist if i search like vimeo daniel shiffman whoa wow we're going to find some really old stuff who knows i was hoping my vimeo account would show up but um so i would say probably almost 10 years ago now that is insane um i i've been teaching at a you're program for the introduction to the coding train and then an hour later i'm like back to the community contribution sorry i'll move this along more quickly so i'm i'm a graduate of this program at nyu uh and i've been teaching there for a number of years now and i used to just make videos for the courses and i started publishing them on vimeo um in 2005 i definitely was making these videos in 2012 i think a little bit before then too um in about two so and the topic of these videos is our co it's programming programming and computer coding and the angle that i'm coming from is a term that's often used called creative computing uh creative coding i think that some i have some issues with that term but it is nice i think of it in a similar way to i think of like what creative writing like uh creative writing isn't something it doesn't mean that all writing isn't creative but it's a sort of like common term that we can understand when referring to fiction or poetry and a certain kind of of the certain kind of way of thinking and being with each other as we write so i think of creative coding as the same sort of thing and if you go specifically to like the coding challenges which it's a kind of insane that i don't have one of these since march although you might remember something happened in the world i mean it happened before march but it really started happening here in this united states in march so that's kind of been the issue here but um for me but um you'll see that a lot of these have to do with graphics and um uh you know generative art and just sort of like experimental stuff so that's the main topic i also use primarily um the tools that i use to program on this channel are primarily not exclusively but primarily from the processing foundation and actually if you go to the processing foundation website you'll find me here as someone who's on the board of directors i should also mention something really exciting here that there's a new uh project lead a moira turner for the p5.js project um the tool the tools that i'm using most right now are the uh p5 web editor which is made and the lead developer is cassie tarakisian and the p5.js library the new lead is moyra turner um so uh you should definitely read all about the processing foundation it's my heart and soul is with the processing foundation it's kind of like the focus of my work everything kind of like from teaching and youtubing all that kind of leads in or branches out from there um but one of the things that if you're new to this channel um i do have this tab on the website called beginners so if you go here into beginners there are really three uh pla playlists here right now this is probably the one if you're if you've never coded before this is probably the one that i'd recommend in that it's most recent this is the kind of thing that i probably should reboot every few years and it's getting a little bit out of date but you know i have i don't know how to manage like time and topics but someday maybe that will happen but if i go to here you'll see um the some of these videos are for more recent than others but really they're they're from about two years ago now but largely the same so this is you can learn to program it's all the very basics um i think this is maybe even you know i'm not an expert here but i think appropriate from like sixth grade and up so sixth grade is like 12 13 that's or 11. i should know this considering that i have a son who's in sixth grade like literally and he is twelve so must be somewhere around there um but when i hear so i hear the pitter patter of feet um so there's other people wandering close to the attic um in my house here uh so this is where i would recommend if you if you want to try the coding train stuff there's plenty of other resources on the internet that you can find you need to learn to code through my uh stuff but um you can find um the intro series here so um so i have i i have a bit of a sort of strange practice which has uh i've never really sort of figured out but i do i both have sequenced tutorials with some light editing and you'll find those all here on the website like in github git github for poets or nature of code simulating natural systems you can find these different like playlists here and then um i also i guess i also have i do these live streams which as you can tell if you're watching all 610 of you what it's a i don't know where you are in the world but right now on the east coast in the new york city area it is just beautiful out so um please this will be available for viewing later clearly i'm not doing anything but just rambling so enjoy the outside if you can uh but also hello to those of you who are watching from india like kartik uh that is just amazing and wonderful to me um but um i also live stream and generally the live streams have actually been the same a lot of the same content that's in all of these videos but just without any of that light editing so if for example here one of the most watched videos that i have on my channel which is a coding challenge number three the snake game this is um and oh i'm gonna learn machine learning apparently this course is about machine learning um hello and welcome to what today will be a 15minute coding i'm logged i'm logged into youtube through my nyu program so this coding challenge if i go through it somewhere in the middle it says like there's like it says like stop for technical difficulties or something um and then here in the description there was a link to it oh no maybe it's a pinned comment yeah so the pin comment here now takes you to the live stream so if i go to this exactly i need to add this is now live stream number 32 which is like two over two hours long where i was doing a ton of um stuff i should really log in i have youtube premium um on uh other google accounts if like multiple youtube premium accounts are just really dumb i need to like get rid of one figure that out uh um but uh anyway so but one of the things that i actually would like to do this year that i'm hoping to figure out is just have a weekly live stream like this one which is just kind of chatting having fun looking at stuff speaking of somebody who does this well um cj in the chat has a lot of different kinds of live streams that he does on twitch that are sometimes just q a's and just like working through a problem in an informal way um so i want to try to do more of that um maybe saturdays at 10 from 10 to 12 and then fall guys steam games afterwards with my kids so that's um oh oh the new member track is panned to the right it doesn't be okay something was going wrong there okay uh i don't know what's going i'm looking at the chat there's some like things going on in the chat all right so um so that's that's that's uh that's my introduction to the channel i guess um i have a a a long uh ton of like probably almost a thousand tutorial videos that you can go back and find and i'm planning to do a lot more new stuff but one of the things that i really try to do is engage with the community so the main place to do that is through the discord i'm pressing a button um now uh which will pop up the discord link in the chat and also through the community contributions on the website so let's go back to the wheel spin time and bruno just when i thought i was finally gonna get to doing something i now have to welcome bruno two the coding trade the panic inducing timer right yeah good old days uh bruno your coding train random number is hundred and 28 one thank you for joining uh so i guess i can talk about membership stuff um in a little bit but um let's go ahead and look at some community contributions so i was saying david gypsy dangerous on uh helps put this together it pulls from a spreadsheet which is sort of duplicates of all the community contributions on the website if i've shown one already it gets uh taken off the spreadsheet and then this p5 sketch uh is populated with a ran uh with i think i guess ten one two three four five six seven nine ten and i can spin this wheel and when i spin it we're gonna we don't know what we're gonna get because the numbers are here we're gonna land on number 44 and i think now if i do remove and view selected that's going to bring it up yes so this brought up a coding a contribution by gene loop uh called 3d tictactoe oh this is exciting to see so the original uh one that this is based on is this uh coding challenge number 149 tictactoe uh i encourage you to check this one out original code and there's a lo this one has a lot of contributions wow look at that um and i also did a followup to this using the minimax algorithm to uh for an ai to play uh tictactoe and let's look at um let's look at gloop's uh version oh awesome what's the slider do what's that i can't oh this is the speed maybe oh and look at that for the when it when it wins i guess it's when it gets three in a row in this 3d space it like highlights it by turning on the stroke that is really cool i want to watch this again amazing work oh i love it when it's diagonal so one thing um i'm just going to switch over to change the url to full so you don't you definitely don't need to do this i i really like it when you're sharing a p5 web editor sketch to share the um the view that has a full because that way it has the top bar so i can see the name and the who created it as well as uh click over here and we're now at the code and we can see this um this is so cool to see so this is using wow the web i'm always amazed by what the webgl renderer can do um in p5.js great work um i assume oh so um uh k weakman is giving me a comment that i want to uh address in a second um um yeah actually i forgot what i was gonna say great great job oh you know i had all this energy and adrenaline and having such and then just like a moment there i took like a deep breath and like everything drained out of me and i feel like it's time to go take a nap all of a sudden um what was i saying webgl oh yes um if you happen to be if i happen to like come across your uh community contribution while um live and you're in the chat please let me know i don't know how we authenticate that but it's great then we can ask questions and chat about the code and you know i've done various things where i sometimes like even have somebody call in but i'm not really set up for that right now so maybe we'll get back to that in the future um so k weekman just passed along there was a message in the chat in this website learning noc doesn't have the playlist updated since dan is making new videos can those go in archive so unfortunately i don't know what that um i don't know what that's referring to which website it's probably this oh learning nature of code um these are the updated ones they're just as far as i got last spring so i guess i'll need more information but um what you should do if there are things that need to be fixed or out of date or broken on the website um go here to the github repo which is slash coding train slash website and uh file um post a new issue uh i would love to hear from you you know um there's a lot of people that help with maintaining all these github repos um and so you know we're certainly behind on on getting back to a lot of these like issues and questions but this is a place where you can um file a question or concern like that um okay can you please check out your community our community contribution of your seven segment delay okay i i don't really i i hesitate to start taking requests to look at uh community contributions that people are asking for in the chat because i don't know how to manage that but since it happens to be the first one that i noticed i'll say i am going to uh take a look at that but um that that's probably gonna be the only one otherwise i'll spin the wheel so let's go to um this was boswar who asked i'm gonna go to uh coding challenges seven segment display um and let's see can i how do i find yours will i recognize ah write down a rainbow clock by boswar chakraborty and anusha trapati excuse me my voice is just just uh my voice is changing it happens multiple times in my life why the key you can see ah okay rainbow clock let's take a look oh this is awesome september 12 saturday 10 43 this like kind of cool background and now like there's all these sliders top left oh it's like a dynamic i can pick a color for the corners and i guess it interpolates between them so like if i slid them all down to here are these is this hue saturation brightness is it rgb i would love to know clocks are always an assignment that i often give in my creative coding classes it's a fun thing for people to be creative with and this is oh look at this oh it must be hue right because if i only have one slider and the color is changing it's most likely you this is awesome thank you for sharing this i love also to see that you're hosting it with github pages which is a really nice way to be able to host your work online for free that is something i really need to redo my github pages tutorial um i should be taking notes uh that would be sort of very helpful i think um okay let's look at one more uh wheel spin where's my wheel close and spin this wheel oh i was about to say and it's number 40 but it is number 93 so let's take a look at this one pong atari version contributed by mark n so this is from the original okay let's see if you ha if you i mean i don't there's honor system here i suppose but just imagine that i made a coding challenge to make pong how long do you think it took me to make a very simplistic basic version of pawn i i seem to remember this one was well over an hour and i think it got light lightly edited down uh to hello uh about um uh oh no does this have ad breaks in it one of the things uh i i tried to turn that off anyway i i'll come back to that i have some issues i'm kind of like taking ads off many of my videos on youtube but i can talk more about my systems for doing that but um this one is an hour and eight minutes to make pong and then we can take a look at uh this pong atari version made by mark n let's take a look oh cool so i guess the atari version is mostly in the aesthetics although it's a sound on so maybe we're gonna get some sounds as well let's see how do i start oh yeah can you hear the sounds yeah i think you can oh this is so cool i don't remember what the key for the other one was i need definitely need to work on like a reinforcement learning algorithm or some kind of just methodology for the computer player this is so fun sorry everybody the livestream has to end now because i need to play this pond all day long afternoon great job i love this i especially love how the scores are made with just like uh shapes in p5 um i would say that you but like probably this seems like maybe the default font that maybe p5 uh had um policy gradients should work well says k weak mind um and arnov says i remember you got stuck with the part where you couldn't get the angle for the ball to bounce off the paddle yeah so first let me welcome joshua b oh i can't believe how many new members have joined one of the things i need to do is plug in this uh philips hue light strip that i have um which in theory i can get to blink where can i plug this in a lot of power outlets everywhere but um i want one one of the things on my list is to get this working again and it'll blink and do shiny colors when people join and i've got to give joshua b this random number oh i'm sorry their random number or i don't want to uh make assumptions about uh people's pronouns here uh 31 771 thank you very much all right so uh both xp um passes along a question from carl breckon hi daniel big fan thank you uh i have a big fan right over here where's my there's i do have drums here as my son plays the drums i need to have him just like the whole time over there doing like a uh what's that called when you have the snare it's the snare at the end of a joke um uh bro bought your book uh nature code is p5 an extension of processing or are they a lot different i'm primarily asking which i should spend my time trying to learn first um that's a great question and i get this is like probably one of the most frequently asked questions and maybe i should do a writeup or a video i'm kind of answering that question i do have some videos that um comparing p5 and processing let's try googling it this way so there's a few of them um and i think there's even another one that's not called this but it's i can't remember what it's called so these these are from three years ago or over well over three years ago um but they might help you uh think this question through a little bit more um rim shot thank you yes but basically what i would say is so p5 is not an extension of processing so to give you the short version of this processing is a project and i can go to the processing website which is currently actually being redesigned exciting project that's happening um which was created in 2001 invented by casey reese and ben frye and it is a java based and i could run it right here on my computing machine and i could open up any of my examples and run them and it's a wonderful platform to use to learn programming to make a lot of projects with um p5.js is not an extension of processing the way that i um would like to the way that i would describe it is a reimagining of processing for the web and actually one of the original goals of processing and principles behind it was having things shareable on the web but java applets were the way to do that um in 2001. so now javascript and canvas and just the the sort of native uh javascript api for the web itself is the way to do that so that's what p5 and so there's a lot of compatibility there's a lot of the same stuff in both of those but p5 also works in slightly different ways to be more true to today's age as well as the web itself so i don't think there's a way to pick which one um certainly the advantage of doing p5.js is um you know there's some advantages to learning javascript and where that's going to take you as a programmer in your journey right now and also the shareability um it's much it's if you're doing p5 um and you share your project it's easy for me to click on a link and just run it whereas if it's a processing project i might have to download it or copy paste the code and run it so there's sort of different situations for different things i could go on and on about this but um certainly my intro materials are a little bit more up to date with p5.js the beginner series i have about processing look look how there's like no look look at the amount i mean i guess i look kind of the same but there's just like no gray anywhere these were i think these are from like 2012. so close to 10 years ago oh no well it says 2015 that's the thing i think though a lot of these videos were made years earlier and i just uploaded them to youtube in 2015. so um so but i think this still um the quality of these videos is not as um high or in many ways it might be better because i'm like i think i like losing brain cells every year and i'm getting weirder and maybe these were like more organized in terms of uh teaching um last time dan played with the hue both xp rights last time dan played with the hue lights i ended up acquiring a hub and five lights i got hue lights you want to come sponsor me just i'm just in it for the sponsors these days all right it's almost 11. i do want to program something today um so let me move to making getting making an organized list of um things i want to work on this fall so i am going to um clone this github repo i have no idea what's working and not working on this computer let's update oh shoot we're gonna have to fix that um let's go to the desktop i don't think i have and let's let's grab the uh oh no no no i didn't want to do the website i want to do a rainbow topic you know i really should rebrand and change this github repo to be um like train stations or something train theme but i can't i can't i can't bring myself to change it from being called rainbow topics because at one time this channel was called coding rainbow wasn't that how many of you were viewers back in the day of coding rainbow get clone um let's go into here and let's open it up so i'm going to make a markdown file and i am going to how do i do this make a new file new file let's call this fall 2020 coding train fall 2020. so here i am go my goal for this right now is to kind of make a list and a few different categories let's think about the categories um tutorials like i'm going to call this sequence tutorials for um you know nyu curriculum i'm just gonna let's get let's say course curriculum i want to do some coding challenges i would like to do coding in the cabana those are really the same but i don't know i do have in some ways like a little bit of a reason why some videos i think work in the coding cabana context um as well as uh let's call it side projects for example and i actually thought i might try to do this today uh i don't i'm very far away from the microphone now if you can still hear me but in this box i have here uh in this box uh this is shipped from uh all the things does it have a shirt in it do i get a tshirt in this uh anyway this is an everyday calendar made by uh uh uh youtuber simone yertz and i'm i'm not i would love help with pronouncing um her name a huge fan uh and uh i'm excited to open this up hang this on the wall behind me um and see if i can uh program i believe it has an arduino in it and i can hook that up or even network it and i can start to program stuff for it so that's a side project that i want to just do on saturday live streams um and maybe even i kind of like wouldn't mind unboxing this today just to sort of see um so let's put that here every day calendar um i'm gonna mirror so what the thing that i would love to do is get it so that um i can wave my hand in front make it a danny rosen style wood mirror so if you're not familiar with danny rosen's work um danny rosen makes uh these uh wow this is like a very old photo uh makes these uh physical mirrors this is a mirror made out and uh daniel rosen also teaches at itp this is a physical mirror made out of wood blocks that turn and light reflects off of them so when they're turned up they're brighter when they're turned down there's a light from above and so i want to try to do something like that you can see all these other examples of of work that danny rosen has done so i highly encourage you to check that out i want to do something like that huge flaws in your green screen i know right um i guess i could try i i worked on this so much the other day and it was perfect i could try making this light brighter i don't know if that's going to help well that's going to make it worse i think i don't know if i made it better or worse i'm going to just go back to what it was there's nothing i can do about that today i will work on fixing i mean fixing my green screen uh later if you're going to do a factorial tutorial when do you think you would do it code fanatic i believe i have a factorial tutorial maybe somebody can find it i think i might have two of them uh it's certainly in the nature of code book there's a section in the nature code book about it okay so that's one side project um i want to continue with the hue light interaction um so that's that all right let's look at the courses i'm teaching this fall so one of them is introduction to machine learning for the arts um and let's so and a lot of this would go with um um this is not um this uh so a lot of this is already here so i want to go through this list and see what's missing that i need to make videos on so i have videos on transfer learning with teachable machine i have image classification uh pretrained models let's go look at ml5js um uh ml5.js community stands in solidarity with black lives matter i'm going to click on this and go to i want to go to the reference and let's look at what some models that i so i have not made any tutorials with body picks unet or face api so body picks unet face api i don't think i have a style transfer although i do have that one with yaning she i do have a guest maybe i don't i think he'll skip style transfer um pics depicts wow there's a lot of stuff here yolo i definitely want to do uh put that um i think it's actually called in ml5 it's called object detector now it's a more generic class um dc gan cvae i'm not so sure um i mean these would all be good and more let's do this i think probably realistically this might be where i stop like um i feel like okay so this is something i definitely want to do um this fall data collection model training so i have a lot on that but i don't think i have a video tutorial about uh model training in ml5.js with json or our csv data so that's something that's possible convolutional neural networks uh cnn in ml5.js tutorial you can try that uh runway uh so although i need to redo all my runway tutorials uh runway ml so i'm gonna do gpt2 training and deployment and uh stylegan training and deployment these are the models i want to do i think there's also object detection and more so that's that um oh oh yeah interact somehow interactive image yeah image interactive image sense of this i wanted to interactive image synthesis so these are a um a list of video tutorials and so my plan is to record tutorials like this in this it at uh in a recording room that i that is at nyu i haven't been to the building yet but it is open again and i have access to it um so that i'll probably be doing on fridays those won't be live streamed i'm going to record them they'll be lightly edited and published but that is a benefit for members i usually will do a a member a live stream for coding terrain members which is just kind of like on in the background as i'm recording so it's really in some ways it's just to like have a little bit of a smaller community and get some feedback as i'm going so um so stay tuned if you're a member that's if i if if all goes according to plan that's the main benefit of joining uh coding train members to um is that okay so this is really um i should probably put this under machine learning and then uh i'm gonna just do like um i'm just gonna call this a to z so the other course that i'm teaching this fall um is and it's it's just about time for my short break but let's see if i can get through this um is called uh and program from a to z and these are nyu university courses so this is uh you know my day job but it helps me keep organized in terms of what types of content i need to work on um that i can then share with the broader coding trained community so looking at this um there are what what do i what do i need to do so i have stuff all here i wanted to do um this erasure poetry uh coding challenge i don't know if i'll get to that uh regular expressions i have a set of tutorials i think i should probably do a uh host sketch with p5.js tutorial um node with i think i don't know if i yeah uh sorry with github pages i feel like the github pages tutorials i have are so out of date and i'm always uh mentioning students to do that so that's something i should add um a live poll app is listed as a side project that's actually thank you oh yeah did i already do the cnn videos i think that's i think that's where i like left off i think i like didn't finish them but you're right i don't remember where i got with that so i'll have to look so um live poll application uh overlay yes that's definitely something i want to do that could be a sidebar that could actually be a stepbystep tutorial but probably better for that to be a side project um where where else am i uh data and apis so i have a bunch of data and api tutorials but what would be i think like a word nick coding train this is a really important one so i do have this word nick video from 2015 uh i would love for somebody to if you want to if you want a little side helpful project to help me out and you want to learn word nick go and check out this word nick tutorial and let me know if it still applies or if you can't uh because that's like an important one uh so any new apis that might be interesting for me to show um actually one is um that i've been having fun with recently is the uh tenor gif api so let's do this tenor i mean gif api um so if you're not familiar with tenor i mean there's giphy the reason why i'm gonna mention tenor is just because uh tenor is doing a thing where they're creating like official pages for different content creators or youtubers so if i search coding train on tenor now um there's all these like gifs that i didn't make these but somebody at google or a tenor i'm not sure how that partnership works there's all these gifts so i encourage you to use them i get a little bit too much uh pleasure out of seeing myself in gift form i mean honestly like i don't know why anybody should use these there's but there's a page that has all of them i don't know how to get to it um like official coding train tenor gif uh yeah official partner there we go so this this is how you can get to all of the official coding train gifts also if you make any um i can include them here so that's something that we can discuss in the discord button to the discord where is my discord button there it is okay um tenor gif api almost to my i really got to take a break because i really have to stop at like noon i wonder if i can make it to 12 30 and not get yelled at um so data apis okay so um 2020 apis so by the way this is going to get push and i'll i would love uh suggestions so you can contribute to this once i uh once i uh put it online i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm just reading the chat this is kind of confusing me uh uh okay um uh where am i here okay so discord bot tutorial twitter bot reboot so one thing that i actually could use um help with um i have a full example working with the new twitter api new way that it works with web hooks and getting events and all that it's really exciting it took me forever to figure that out so i haven't been doing nothing this time that i've been live streaming so i've actually been working on figuring all of that out which would would have been a nice thing for me to do in a live stream but i just was not anywhere where i had any equipment to live stream but one of the things that i haven't been able to figure out which i just actually haven't gotten to is i want to move away from using this um node package uh called twit which is fantastic and it works but the other stuff that i have with the new web hooks i'm not using it and so it feels like weird to use both of these and so and this i'm just looking for the github link the reason why i unfortunately can't use this anymore is it's just very out of date hasn't been updated in two years twitter api is vastly different a lot of it still works but i want to just use fetch or i guess there's a new thing called axios i don't know what that is but i feel like i see people using axios now instead of fetch so maybe i should use axios instead that's a whole new set but i i finally made a set of tutorials on fetch last year so really do i have to reredo it um so um anyway so that is twitter bot reboot so this is the new web hook stuff this is so much to do and also um deprecate twit uh npm package um okay so um i think i'm going to stop there for right now and there's lots of things that i need to revisit and i could go back to let's just go back briefly to this late night repo if i had that anywhere i don't know where it is i'm gonna have to pull it up again is it this one yeah i mean some of these some of these i should bring back uh yeah all right um oh yeah gpt2 but i'm about that i'm already i guess i can make a note that what i was going to do with the gpt 2 training is so the idea for this one is mine all coding train captions and train model i guess i could just say download okay all right so let's move to here um and let's create a branch and push that up to the repo this is exciting i feel so excited to have this organized list uh and you know i i should model doing a really thoughtful pull request with a lot of explanation but i'm just going to do this because uh lack of time right now and here we go so this looks good i don't know why i put a little check mark here for this one and not any of the others um i have been using notion as a sponsor of the coding train i have been using notion to keep a lot of things organized and it's possible it might make sense to use notion as an idea tracking and suggestion system but i guess i'm going to keep this for right now i'm going to merge this in and i would encourage you those of you watching right now to to contribute to this so if you have useful references if you have a way of thinking about how you might want to organize this differently if you want to like add all the check boxes that i forgot to add um you could file an issue or a pull request and um i will try to keep an eye and violet i should see as watching um can be a point person for this as well to keep an eye on helping um keep this list organized and probably next friday is when i'm gonna start so i don't know what i'm going to do like start going through this list bouncing back and forth between machine learning and a to z and then the side projects will be on the weekends when i do live streams hopefully saturday mornings so fridays and saturdays are my coding train days for this fall axios is a version of node fetch not fetch much as many features much more than that is also not new anymore it's new to me right hello amy a new member amy welcome i have been live for since 10 a.m and uh let's i'm gonna take a break in a minute but before i take a break i want to thank the sponsor of today's brilliant and because i'm very tired all of a sudden and i'm starting to feel like i can't think straight see straight think clearly i'm gonna add a little coffee to my mug this is my technivorm mocha master i think this is is this dutch maybe i don't know scandinavian i'm not sure somebody will tell me why i've lost so many viewers you know what you go on the side project is the rubik's cube stuff protectorate well that could be a coding okay so what could possibly be better than a mug that has mathematical formulas on it come on focus right uh what could possibly be better than that well i have something to tell you that could be better and it is brilliant it is it's not only brilliant it is brilliant um so oops i pressed the wrong button um so uh do you want to learn something new brilliant is the place to do it brilliant is a website an app that makes learning accessible and fun their approach is based on problem solving and active learning it's about seeing concepts visually and interacting with them and then answering questions that get you to think their courses are laid out like a story and broken down into pieces so that you can tackle them a little bit at a time there are no tests no grades just pick a course based on what you're interested in and get started if you make a mistake no big deal check out the explanations to find out more you can learn on your own pace there's something for everybody basics of algebra learn programming i learn about cutting edge topics like neural networks so that's what i uh the the sort of uh uh what i captured for you off the of the website that i wanted to show you is i have a whole set of video tutorials on neural networks and a wonderful companion piece to that is the brilliant course uh neural networks um that you can and what i love about it is it's different than watching a video that's just stuff that you can interact with um and play with um so one of the things that's really um exciting to me that i just learned recently is that brilliant has a new course and um the new course is about uh infinity so reckoning with infinity is a major like it's just a it's a big topic to tackle in your brain hard to do and so uh the course starts with basic counting and and if you if you go through and you'll work your way up to many different types of infinity culminating in the profundity of cantor's theorem explore the stunning beauty of fractals uh tessellations in hyperbolic space so many things so one of the things that i particularly love about brilliant is that i i really use it um as a mechanism for coming up with ideas for things that i want to try to program in p5.js um let me just go to the website really briefly um i'm generally trying these daily challenges i hear footsteps children children you should be on brilliant.org learning some math and science right now what uh i'll tell you more about it later um so but i want to just check out um the new infinity course just like briefly together um let's see if i can find it here um so so just to be clear you can um you can sign up for free and do the daily challenges and a lot of free stuff and there's an app as well um but if you go to brilliant.org coding train um you can get a 20 off discount uh the first 200 people who use that link at least for the premium subscription which unlocks everything um all of the courses and everything so let's see let's continue course i i just clicked on it this morning but i didn't do go very far so you can see here let's let's go through a little bit of it together um just for a couple minutes and then i'll give you some time if you want to like check it out yourself and i'll take a short break let me move the banner out of the way okay so in this course you'll learn what infinity is how it's used in mathematics and why it's indispensable everywhere from the fundamentals of euclidean geometry and algebra okay uh all right which of these is infinite the number of fish in the sea no right that's a discrete amount i mean we i don't know what it is like we could we could go through an exercise and try to estimate the number of positive integers yes the number of grains of sand and all the beaches on earth no that's also we could estimate that the number of possible combinations that a standard circular combination lock can have that is not infinite that's a very large number so let's let's see if i get this right correct oh that's good i got that one right okay uh the major distinction between finite and infinite is a bit more slippery than just saying they're infinitely many whole numbers because you could count them forever please don't try this proof technically at home we don't have forever to spend counting oh oh i take that as a personal challenge next live stream counting all of the infinite number of whole numbers if you're asked to prove that there are infinitely many whole numbers i was hoping i would get to the thing that's in the video here like in the video here i wanted to do this one there's like about infinite areas and things maybe this will pop up here because i mean i thought i'm in quiz one but we'll see um not even entire life spent counting counts as proof however here's a logical argument that takes only a few minutes to say if there were finitely many whole numbers there would be a largest whole number there is no largest whole number because for any positive whole number x what is also a whole number and is uh larger than x x plus one oh all of the above i was going to say i would use oh my god i'm not in the right place um i would use x plus one but i suppose all of the above is true so i'm going to do that correct all right i'm going to get one wrong soon enough i have not done this before i have no i have some sometimes i'll do the brilliant thing and i like looked at it earlier i have not looked at this at all so the continuity of lines and geometry and calculus motivates another flavor of infinity on a line or line segment any two points that have not any nonzero distance between them have infinitely many points between them yes for example there's always a point halfway between any two points as we'll discuss later in this course this also corresponds to the fact that there is always a decimal value that's exactly halfway between any pair of different decimal values okay if the two positions x and z are on the line above are at a distance of 0.101 apart if y is exactly halfway what is the distance between x and y oh this requires me to do some like hard math x and z are 0.101 y is half so wouldn't it just be half of 1 0 1 which is .05 05 right i think it's this one okay you got that right i was like afraid that like i was like is this a trick question there must be something going on here um geometry has a lot of inherent infinities that are built into the nature of common geometric objects even empty geometric space is an infinitive of sorts like for example there's an infinite number of points inside of um of a circle but it depends how you you measure those points i suppose oh i just i said some weird stuff there that didn't necessarily make sense and edit that part out but there's oh i'm live okay sorry even empty geometric space uh okay it's not which of these is a finite quantity the length of a line y equals mx plus b on the coordinate plane no that's not finite if the line goes uh to through in the infinity of twodimensional space the area of a circle with a radius one this is finite the number of different cartesian coordinates in 3d space that is infinite and so i'm gonna hit submit correct oh it's very it's big makes me feel so good okay oh my goodness the perimeter of this regular polygon increases every time the number of sides and increases therefore eventually the length of the polygon's perimeter will be larger than the circumference of the gray circle surrounding it no no no it will be this it will it approaches the circumference of the circle so there is a way to create an infinitely long curve the coke curve i believe koch i think that's probably going to come up here that's one i think i have a coding challenge that goes through the coke fractal snowflake and fractal recursion with an arraylist of objects um but this should be false okay got that one right i do have a buzzer sound effect by the way for when i get it wrong that hasn't happened yet all right right we're about to do the coke snowflake here um okay in the animation above pink dots or marks or those so i i'm gonna uh speed through this because i'm very familiar with this particular fractal pattern and i encourage you to check out my video on it or come back to this if we suppose the initial triangle is the area of one square unit is the falling claim true or false you know how many times the steps described above are carried out the total area of the snowflake will never exceed two square units oh boy i don't believe the area is infinite the length of the curve is infinite but i believe the area would be approaches a finite number the question is i don't know what that number would be or how to calculate it and i definitely don't have the time to work that out right now so i'm going to just use my intuition um yeah i guess i'm not saying it right everybody is like making fun of the way that i said i like to say koch curve that's how i always have said it but i believe that's the completely incorrect pronunciation okay um the total error will never exceed two square units how much was the single triangle so we could actually figure this out because um hold on let's do a little bit of work figuring this out this is one square unit so this is this is how much one two three four five six seven eight nine this is one ninth so when we do it once we're saying one plus one third because there's three of those so we go from one to one plus one third which is fourthirds then we're going to say fourthirds plus onethird of fourthirds that ninths there's a formula for this right because if this whole thing oh no no no no the new area we're adding is is uh is onethird of oneninth which is 1 27 but then we get 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 of them oh do i do it everywhere yeah so we get one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen oh i'm so confused it's got to be like something to the n power did anybody solve this for me in the chat it could just i'm going to say that intuition wise if this is like four thirds and then we're adding a little i don't think we're gonna get above two so like just by without working out the exact amount here oneninth of oneninth yeah oneninth of oneninth i'm sorry that was this is ninth of one yeah yeah okay i don't think we're gonna get above two so what was the question again um never exceed two units true correct thank you there's no exact way to calculate it 12 not 13. thank you chris um in this quiz you saw some examples of infinity algebra geometry and a quick proof that are infinitely many numbers we were comparing in the next quiz we'll get to the real the essence infinity we need to find a way to measure and compare different infinities to each other for example is there any sense where the numbers of integers is larger than the number of positive integers are they in reality the same infinity i have done eight percent i love this quiz and i'm going to continue and how to this is the one that i wanted to do so this visualizing infinity one that's the one that i was hoping to do maybe i'll i'll just do it on my own later but um each iteration the area is multiplied by four thirds um no wait i'm wrong [Laughter] these are fun problems to work out and fun problems to make uh interactive sketches to try to explain but um so i'm gonna take a break now um if you are interested in brilliant and you wanna uh another way that you can support um the coding train channel is to go and sign up even for a free account just to brilliant.org slash coding train um and certainly if you use that url um and you choose to either purchase a premium subscription for yourself or gift one to somebody else um you will get uh 20 off discount through that url so um thanks i'm gonna take out just to like only have like a half an hour left unless i can squeeze in a little extra time before my kids kick me out of the attic this is their playroom uh then i'll come back and maybe i'll try to just code up a little something we'll get started maybe i'll unbox this everyday calendar i don't know i look forward to hearing from you i'll be back in about less than five minutes okay dog so do do all right i am coming back in just about 20 seconds i think i want to work on the live poll thing that's what i'm sort of thinking um so first of all simon reminded me on i guess i closed this out already that um if you go to the unbrilliant if you go to the show explanation i would have seen an explanation of the formula and how to calculate the uh area of the um snowflake fractal that's what i'm just going to call it from now the snowflake fractal so i encourage you to go out and check that so um so i have about a half an hour i mean i'll keep going as long as um no one kicks me out but i did promise my children it is saturday i think i'd worked out a way that i can stream every saturday and it doesn't it's not too big of an imposition on family um as long um for the time being at least but um i do need to do stuff with my kids the rest of the weekend my daughter just learned to ride a bike which was like a super fun and thrilling exciting thing um to happen i definitely want to take her for a bike ride today um i also got to do some work preparing for my classes on monday but so hopefully this system's going to work friday's recording sessions at nyu for sequence tutorials saturdays live streams with messing around and working on these side projects so i think i would like to start i think i think i want to start one of these two side projects in which i won't get too far simon has suggested to use a straw ball this is why i should do the poll application because that way i want to have a run a poll and i want to see the live results as an overlay so i guess i could do a poll um but uh i could also just unbox the everyday calendar and try to like plug it in and i uh so let's see let's see what what people think uh simon's telling me to do a straw poll i always try there's two straw poll sites one straw poll dot com and one straw poll dot me i think i need to do a poll to determine which straw poll site i should work use i could also just work on solving a rubik's cube um all right let's let's go for it let's do the straw poll i don't know which one somebody tell me which one to use i'd love to see some coding i think i should try to work on the the live poll app because as much it'll be interesting to unbox the everyday calendar i don't know how exciting that would be for people to watch and i could just do that on my own time and mount it over here and then actually um you know do a live stream where i'm coding it as opposed to unboxing a rubik's cube uh joshua b says today is a great day for a bike ride indeed um agreed um all right um let's work let's let's get started with a coding train straw poll dot me is more but all right we'll try the waste a little more time by doing a poll uh start pull overlay project and then um unbox every day calendar oh 20 minutes of coding train probably uh i don't know sure improve i don't know great poll okay here's the poll everybody somebody put this into the chat live polls don't get up pages yeah uh i'm curious to say i'm not necessarily you i have a of a a reputation for doing the opposite of whatever people vote on um but uh i would love i'd love to just get to get the get a sense has anybody posted it yet in the chat you guys are like at least 30 seconds behind me um and i did it on i guess i could post it be the one to post it try to avoid showing your address did i show my address already i i meant to avoid that did that happen when i was looking at the box um i probably should have not said that okay straw poll dot me okay hold on that didn't show up as a link for some reason solar liner there you go thank you okay so i'm gonna vote for this and uh here are the results so far does this live update oh it does well this is fun you know what's sort of silly is i i don't necessarily need to make my own one of these as an overlay because i could just i would rather i like to have my own i don't know this is pretty um pretty clear i think i'm going to let it get to a huh well i guess even if it got to 100 even if all 15 were for um the unboxing it wouldn't make it all right let's get started here everybody um let's get started with this project let's first um create a repo let's call this a live poll um and let's do this add a remi file um and create the repo um generally these days i prefer to use um whoops just the term main as my main branch so i'm just going to quickly change that here as the default branch and i'm going to go back here to branches and get delete this branch um okay so now let's um clone this repo and whoops um okay so there's um okay so uh let's see so what i'm going to start with and so a couple things i should mention i'm embarking on a little side project adventure here where i'm making an actual web application i am not exactly the person that you should model your own web development practice off of i sort of just tinker whip up projects take shortcuts don't necessarily pay the most attention to certain security things so um i'll try to address those kind of questions and concerns as i go but um there's certainly you know i'm always referring to the coding garden but there's a lot of other channels that really do much deeper dives into frameworks and different sort of systems for more robust web application development but just to try to teach the basics of getting this going here i know that this is going to need to be a node application it needs to be a node application because i need to have some server that's keeping track of everybody's votes so if i were just and potentially i could make use of like a server list something or some type of other like database as a service thing but uh with but i'm gonna write my own uh node code so i know that i want to uh start with npm init npm init uh first of all if you want if you're following along here and i'm jumping into the middle of a project assuming a lot of like uh existing um knowledge of javascript but um if if you want to just try to follow along the things you're going to want to make sure you have are downloaded node onto your computer so that that you can type in node and you want to have some shell access to your machine whether you're on windows or mac or linux and i guess i suppose if you're looking for a bit more on this this is my 2018 workflow series which is largely unchanged we're using visual studio code some shell access get a node so you can lose that uh don't use integers for ids use npm init dash y i don't know what the dash y does simon is suggesting that i use dash y so i'm going to go ahead and do that webrtc for browser browser communication or potentially web sockets yeah there might be um there might be an aspect of this that's uh meaningful to use websockets so um okay so here we go i don't know what dash y does what did dash y do just filled out all that stuff without asking me the questions okay i don't know what dash why did oh and maybe i should uh up update my npm and i'll just run that real quickly oh you've got to be kidding me did i not fix this thing oh i'm the worst i'm the worst so one thing i really like to do so one of the reasons why i'm getting tripped up here is that i use a separate login to this laptop to live stream so this is the main laptop i use for work you can sort of i can lift it up here you can see it with all my stickers and if you're a coding trained member you will get some of these stickers in the mail much more quickly than anybody ever has in the past because i've got a system for that now um but um so i haven't actually spent the time to configure a lot of settings on um this particular login so i'm gonna fix this now this is the time to do all this stuff that it takes time uh just sort of like this is uh in many ways what people are here for in terms of like watching somebody code and talk about it but also this is like the boring stuff um so i uh mpm permissions there's i um you can find i know there's a page if i google this this is exactly what i'm looking for um so basically node will install and configure modules which i don't know why that happened but i want to make sure this is weird there might have been a different error message um this is interesting auto fills the answers with default is what dash y does anyway one of the things you can do with node is install global packages meaning essentially things that you can just install into your computer that run via node that are utilities and tools that you can run from the command line and i always like to make sure those are in a folder um that has the right permissions and that has access to by um that's not globally across all users logged into a machine but so that's what this is doing here so i actually want to make sure i do this i'm going to make a directory that is tilde is just my home directory which is you can see user slash coding train that's what tilde is i want to make sure i make that global directory i want to set the prefix um for global packages to that i don't know why again i'm still not sure why and then i've got to add that to my path um so um things go there as well as ah so i am using as my shell or bash no i'm not using bash so the configuration information is in a file called um dot z shrc because i am using something called zsh which is the z shell uh it is designed for interactive use powerful scripting language blah blah blah blah blah blah blah i don't i address this a little bit in a video and so i think if i say source that that's me following these instructions instead of dot profile i'm getting this error i know crap i know how to fix this error i don't know how far far into the weeds i want to get with this but uh let's see if this if that at least did this yeah so that works now that was weird was that okay so i should be updated now and if i look at this i've got my package.json so all i've got so far boy this is this side project's going to take a while but all i've got so far is a um um all i've got so far is just the package.json so i i want to run a web server so i'm going to make a new file i will call it index.js and i'm going to just pull from my working with data and apis examples which has some boilerplate stuff in it intro to data apis and js maybe module two i made a web app that was the data selfie app so i think this will have kind of the boilerplate stuff that i want so i'm going to grab this i know i might want a database but i'm actually not going to worry about that right now and just make sure i have an app that listens and that it serves some static files so because i'm using express which is a very lightweight framework for creating web servers i need to npm install i think you can just say mbmi for short express so that's not installing a global package but a local package which is now as part of my project here under dependencies um and simon is suggesting i changed this to mit that sounds fine with me and is this the place where i would do something like if i wanted to say npm start and have it do like node index.js is that how i do that so if i want to say npm start or does it already know to do that because main is up here is index.js i don't know npm start right so i'm running npm start now the server's listening at 3000 port 3000. so if i were to create now a directory called public and put in it a file called index.html and just say how do you do that isn't there a thing there's a thing in visual studio code where i type a set of commands and it just like it out spits out like boilerplate html does anybody know how to do that i'll just write uh hello world uh exclamation point tab exclamation tab there we go thank you cj for the win here um so we're going to call this a live coding train poll and i should think eventually uh this is a a definitely a um if i go to the live poll app issues train themed with hearts and rainbows everything should be train themed with hearts and rainbows so this is a uh help wanted this is a way you can contribute by helping me with the land the language and designs of this poll application so let's see now if i go to localhost 3000 we can see here you know we've set up this web application so i'm getting somewhere with this project um okay i'm getting something with it's coding trainbow yes i'm getting somewhere with this project awesome so i think i will include p5 because while all of this could be done with native javascript and dom i think i'll use a canvas to in real time draw the equivalent of people's voting so i want to make sure that i include the p5 library and a quick little cheat that i have here is i can get the cdn and there might even i might even want to have sound but i'm just going to use the p5 library here by adding this script tag uh to here where did that go just uh just under head i can add a script tag does it go where like here it's i mean i don't know that it matters but here it's first above like the meta stuff so i don't know it feels like wrong like i feel like it should be here or below the title i don't actually know where should it be is there a correct answer to this question i don't think so uh okay so i'm gonna put that there and uh i'm also then going to create a new file i'll call it sketch.js for p5 um and um what was i looking for let's go back to here and just grab this i mean i could have figured out how to type that we're going to put this at the bottom of the body sketch.js and so now if i go here and create function setup uh function draw and i'm going to say create canvas uh 400 by 300 i'm going to use clear because i want it to be oh why is my all of my auto format everything so much i have to configure on this i really i'm gonna need to do that on a live stream just like set up my dev environment it's like i have all this set up on my main log into the computer now because i use it all the time um two two two okay um i want to show i'll deal with this later um where are my kleenex i bought kleenex with me anyway um clear uh let's draw a rectangle i'm gonna change the autocomplete stuff uh 10 uh with uh i'm gonna do it at 10 10 with some width and 20 so i just want to uh do something very silly right now uh which is map the sine of an angle which goes between negative 1 and 1 to between 0 and 300 and let's say fill 255 0 100. i just want to see a rectangle growing and shrinking oh and then let's have the angle increase buy some amount okay so oh i'm not doing this in the p5 web editor i didn't need to host this oh how i wanted to experiment with ngrok because that's something um that i need in the uh rainbow topics i only have five minutes left but i'm gonna go until i get kicked out uh fall 2020. so here because so twitter um so to run uh a twitter bot um when i go and finally do that new sequence tutorials you need to run a a web server that has a publicly accessible url so one way to do that is with glitch that's how i in my experiments this summer glitch is a uh an online web editor that i like to use um has lots of wonderful features that you can run node for me to be able to get that to work though i had to purchase a premium account because otherwise the glitch apps if you don't have a premium account go to sleep and if i have a twitter bot this is running in the background i need for it not to go to sleep but i believe a way that i can very quickly spin up a publicly accessible url for a web hook just from like any computer anywhere on the internet is with something called ngrok is that true i have never used ngrok and i believe there's some node packages that use it very easily so that's kind of um one thing i want to do the reason why i might use it now is because i want to open it as a browser i want to see it as an overlay on the live stream so is that something that i could make happen really quickly without like causing a major security issue i'm looking to the chat i prefer it below the title as well some html parsers like to see the meta tags at the top oh with ngroku limited to 40 connections per minute so websocket connection could be quickly saturated with all the live stream viewers all right so i could so here's a question i have what is a way that i can deploy a one thing i haven't figured out is so whenever i've worked on something and i deploy it to glitch i just um i just copy paste it basically but from what i understand glitch does have behind the scenes it can be a get remote so could i push this to glitch is there a way that i could just add like so git remote dash v like right now the live poll app is just on uh locally on this computer the code is pushed to github but on github i can't run um i can't um i can't run a node server on github it's just for hosting the repo um yes that will work you could also link to a github repo so i've done that but i feel like when i link to it it's not there's not a quick way to just like update the code so so simon yes i could use heroku but i don't want to right now um i could also use netlifly is like a thing that apparently i can connect vs code and glitch via an extension um this could go to sleep now i don't care about this being premium it can definitely go to sleep i would like to figure out the connecting to glitch so let's let me log into glitch i think i can do this without exposing any private information sign in so i believe my pro account is through my google account not my nyu one which i would be disturbed by putting publicly here but um it's easy to find my nyu address anywhere on the internet right it's i it's it's over for me with email so my all my email addresses are everywhere on the internet i get oh uh okay great okay great um hold on i'm just uh texting back my family to let them know status um there is uh there's some frittata action happening downstairs i definitely want to get in on that if i can um so it's this so now i need to enter my password which i'm going to have to i'm just going to switch to the camera here um i'm being invited to a raid you guess what that means for those of you who have watched the coding train enough um yeah um all right hold on hold on hold on hold on uh daniel uh by the way if you've emailed me at daniel at thecodingdrain.com recently i haven't checked that email address in a very long time so apologies the best way to interact with the community and me is through the discord okay i've gotta do my twostep verification come on uh yes it's me and here i am so i think i'm going to now uh go back here so this is my glitch account it's the one that i have a boosted account um you can see this renatbot thing if you want to explore that world that's my twitter bot that i've been working on that is that i've figured out everything through this uh web hook thing um so what i want to figure out is how can i this is the thing i need to figure out how can i add a glitch project as a remote and push from here to glitch do i need to create a new project first somebody said there's an extension glitch and vs code extension announcing glitch for visual studio code you can now uh you have access to full power of glitch within vs code all key features supported rewind console logs i don't know that this is what i want i really want to develop locally and then just push to glitch not okay um i'm looking at the chat nobody seems to know so how do i um how do i unlock maybe i should just make a new project and then make it a remote wouldn't that work i haven't done so much coding that i couldn't restart in any way let's try is there no blank one important so there's import from github that's what i want to do but i don't think that links it just but let me we should start that way all right so let's uh um let me make i need to make a git ignore file and that should have in node modules what else should that have oh that was put in the wrong place how do i get it back out here yes move it so node modules i also like to put ds store as those files prop up show up always new project import from github yeah i don't think it links it in the way that i want but maybe there's going to be a way that i can do that at least it'll be synced to start um so now uh boilerplate p5 and um express so i'm gonna do something illadvisable which is just push directly to the main branch um don't don't do that don't try this at home uh so let's see everyone's saying it's not gonna link it but i think i'm gonna be able to do it what's the worst thing that can happen new project import from github oh look at this okay so notice that even though i'm sure i have this url open already in a tab i just open a new tab all right until someone tells me to stop doing this whoops um uh this would work unofficial addon glitch project sync okay let's look at that hold on um glitch project sync uh vs code that's a vs code oh no glitch project sync uh github marketplace this uses the glitch api to export your github repo to your glitch project a public github existing glitch project oh boy i don't mind this so this must use like github actions or something but look your projects get url this is a glitch thing so i think i can just add this as a remote so i'm going to do this everybody i think i have an idea for the way i want to do this i'm going to i'm going to import this project i think this is going to work okay all right so now where is that so first i want to change right somewhere here i'm going to make this like coding train live poll okay now somewhere here i should be able to find the github the get remote url right um oh haydar is asking about qx5js yeah i'm excited about that i should definitely love to talk about that no okay where was that uh glitch github get remote oh look at this support oh this game is a git repository so yeah i need to find the project url on glitch i feel like it should show here boost this app editor settings why am i not seeing where this is like on that page i was just looking at import and export okay import and export where's the imported export i know tools at the bottom got it all right so this should oh connect interesting downloadable let's try this so let's just for a second see what this is yeah so why can't i just oh but to be able to push to it i probably have to have like authenticate somehow like i can't just do git remote add first of all i can't show people this otherwise you'll be able to if this were possible you'd be able to like just hack it get remote add glitch this so get i'm i'm like throwing caution to the wind here like so could i do um i mean this shouldn't work if this work doesn't if this works it's a security issue um test commit get push glitch main that worked oh it made a new branch though i guess is it that was weird that was weird okay hold on what is it must be called master i guess boy i everybody no what is the branch name oh can i do get fetch that fetched everything right okay uh glitch slash master new branch let me put something more obvious into the code is this a thing oh new branch i don't understand huh i'm looking at the chat old branch name instead of maine yeah i guess maybe i should use the um maybe i should use the oh hold on i know what to do here let's go into the glitch terminal now this is very okay okay okay on track file on branch master there's no how do i main import master so it's called master but it didn't let me push does not match any why not use heroku i i could use heroku i want to learn how to get this to work with glitch i mean i could go back to this other thing i probably should go back to this wherever that was this um this isn't unofficial you you will just need to merge on the glitch tournament now oh so that's a way i could do it that's two steps it's an extra step but um cj is exactly right git merge main oh no i'm in the wrong place so confusing sorry that this is so tiny and that my microphone is blocking it conflict that's fine are you kidding me automatic merch okay both added yeah i know but how do i this also it's like not updating like what if i refresh the page it's like not updating what i'm seeing here by the way there's settings here oh oh i can make this much bigger for people to see that's good that's maybe too much whoops so probably make more sense for me to use first of all i could just do this on glitch i guess i thought this would be easier um both add a git add file i don't know it doesn't like update let's see i know might need to refresh the page now um like uh can i like and look at what's in the oh yeah look like look what's here why does it not match what's is this like a different branch so weird i don't understand how glitch works whoops so i'm like fixing it by using nano my text editor of choice okay no why does it not show up just do it on glitch for now maybe okay i guess i'm gonna i guess i'm gonna have to um i guess i'm gonna have to explore this later this is like i'm totally lost here um and um thank you for those of you who have joined up here anonymous and prasad brew but one thing that i can do now at least is i can uh refresh app on changes i can view the project where do i do that show uh in a new window so okay so what i can do at least is i'm now going over to open broadcast studio and i'm creating a new browser and i'm going to do this like live poll and i'm going to put in um coding dash train dash live dash poll dot glitch dot me and let's put that in okay so now uh i can close this i've successfully created my poll overlay right not like when if and when i do an actual poll it could show up here uh on the page right so you can see here like this is not this is if i move i don't i don't know why processing is open here um so i have my uh overlay right here wonderful so this is where i'm going with this and the reason why i want to use glitch is so i can have a public url that i can just load as an overlay but i prefer while i'm sort of working it out to like code locally so maybe what i need to do is and make more sense and also have this as a github repo it maybe what i need to do is use that like visual studio code extension i don't know there's got to be a way to do this so i i'm surprised that i haven't been kicked out yet it's 12 20. i should probably finish up this live stream maybe i'll look at one more community contribution i thought of something else to add to my list of side projects actually that i'm really excited about um it's this vinyl cutter and plotter was i editing this maybe i never hit space oh i'm doing something bad here doing something bad i'm doing it anyway um side projects is vinyl cutter for cutting and plotter i'm going to show you what i have the vs code extension allows you to edit a glitch project inside of this and syncs the code so that's definitely that's what i should do i'll explore that um right i could also like ultimately i can just like work on the whole thing when i'm done uploaded to glitch i was just curious if i could you know while i'm iterating like just quickly sync it and i think probably the way to do that um is this vs code extension but um i want to uh just um quickly grab something walking around the attic here i recently both made a purchase um coming back here sitting in the chair i'll turn the camera back on um this is uh and it's not in the box it's why it's very light it's unpacked but this is a cameo silhouette cameo four it is a vinyl cutter and plotter you can see like things that you can make with it here so i want to you can make stickers and all sorts of things i don't really know anything about this but i feel like i want to start making fun physical things for the coding train so this is also we'll i'll definitely spend a saturday one of the saturday live streams hooking this up and trying to do stuff on it so if you're interested in that stay tuned um yeah and maybe i can use my overhead camera to like show that let me push down the green screen for a second before i go you can see the white wall behind me i think i should probably uh turn off the chroma keying if i'm going to do that very quickly that's not a huge difference so this is where i am uh without the green screen behind me and while i have not been interrupted yet although i i def see if i have any text messages i am going to do i have scissors up here you should see what's in this attic piles and piles of arts and craft supplies um and yet just looking for a scissors i'm not sure where i find one i also need to take gloria for a walk i'm just gonna open the box and then i'm gonna go then i can't find i don't know if i can open the box unless i can find a knife or scissors this is not something the chat can help you there's some knitting supplies yarns and dolls postit notes pictures of cats they what is this oh an emergency preparedness kit that's good um box full of stuff um lego set tiara rubik's cube can you even hear me over there there's a cute uh elephant stuffed animal i know where that no there's gotta be a scissor somewhere so much stuff legos sketchbook oh here's a tool toolbox here we go this'll do found something so take a look i'll probably hook this up later don't don't try this at home hopefully i'm not going to hurt myself here open this box the camera image is cropped yeah to where the green screen is i could widen it now but i don't want to mess up too much stuff if you're just tuning in i'm basically done i just like uh wanna while i haven't been um interrupted yet i'm opening my everyday calendar box here's the everyday calendar which i ordered from kickstarter from a youtuber uh simone gertz there's also a tshirt cool maybe i'll wear this later today or wash it first i don't know all right so that's this box now wow he did such a good job with this poster see i want to decorate this wall but um and then like sometimes use the green screen and sometimes not look at this this is gorgeous absolutely gorgeous oh you know one of my favorite things in life one of my absolute favorite things in life is peeling off oh my god it's so nice oh i'm going to leave it on though quietly on my own later but also just protecting it so i want to leave it on right now to continue to protect it look at this look at see plug and usb so i should be able to program this myself through this connection i also should be able to hook it up to the web my goal is to think of this as a grid of pixels and uh be able to like move my hand in front of it and interact with it now what what it's meant for is you uh you pre you you want to like if i want to medi do something every day like every day i want to meditate so i'm just going to use it as a calendar but i think there's a lot of other ways it can be used and so um and uh here's the plug a pin there's a pin this is very cute this pin and see if it'll focus come on camera autofocus magic autofocus yeah see that pin plug adapters for different like european thingies that's very thoughtful and more adapters let's see we can plug this in how do i mount it on the wall it has like these so i just any kind of like uh i guess i need something that i can put in the like picture because i think it would look nice here i mean i don't know if if this is a little bit much to just have this always behind me and usually i'll use the green screen so but maybe i'll put it off to the side but i think for right now i would like for you to be able to see it so a way that i could prop it up or i have an idea you will bear with me for a second i'm gonna move my uh move some stuff around i'll just do this for right now and if i do this um you can see here um here it is so if i want to plug it in and i think it's just an arduino in there that's what i read the poster is a guide okay i should look at that oh what's funny is um what it says is i made the everyday calendar because i wanted to make sure i meditated every day uh and that's the example that i gave that probably where i read it use this as a template if you need help hanging your calendar i know keyholes can be a pain to mark out oh that's so cool what a smart boy she really thought of everything here um i just want to plug it in before i go um and i'm going to have to research how to program it so beautiful um so i this is not a very long cord um how does it take to move this very slowly i do have a plug here so it's going to reach it's very very close i need to unplug something else oh i have to i have to put the right this is so clever i have to put the right adapter on it which is so like this is the plug and then there's a bunch of these adapters this is the us one so i think i just can show you here i'm just going to i want to do more physical stuff here at home and then i'm going to unplug this light a different light plug it in and it's on it's plugged in do i have to turn it on oh it's it's lighting up oh wow it lit up oh i'm getting text messages uh oh the frittata the frittata was eaten i missed the frittata everybody the message says there's a little left for you but we ate it i'm sorry it's okay uh um so now i guess i can like isn't it touch or something that these go on and off when you touch them yeah yeah oh you're not seeing so like for example right here press it can i and can i press it off or what do these do nighttime uh i guess i need to take off this all right everybody i didn't want to do it but it had to be done because i have a feeling cool so what do these do at the bottom do these do something is there like some switches so i want to connect this by usb maybe there's some like software i can run or i can write my own software for it but anyway this will be this is definitely a project i want to do uh more info here oh i guess yeah so um there's a usp port um uh sorry i'm seeing where i am in the past here um all right i think i've got to go it's 12 35 got to move on with my day the kids did not interrupt me which is kind of amazing the poster will guide you i don't i appreciate everyone saying this is a guide but the poster doesn't have a lot of information on it's a wonderful beautiful poster um and it's a it fits right on top and it has in you don't hold january 1st for 45 seconds to reset your calendar how long is 45 seconds anyway i think i probably i might sort of try to work on this next saturday so i think i'll do some research into it i don't think i got to 45 seconds um and try to hang it on the wall uh there's a nice spot for it right over there actually then i can put a camera on it let's see if i can show you the spot that i'm thinking of so um basically oh it's upside down um i'm thinking of putting it on the wall right here it's the perfect width and then i can put a camera on this while i'm live streaming and uh you know this is a really nice spot for it oh it's beautiful i mean it's it's so beautiful i almost want to put this somewhere in the house that's more visible but i guess to experiment and program it putting it here is great so i'm going to work on hanging it i'm going to unplug it i'm going to put it somewhere to be safe um this mess of an attic i'm going to work on hanging it on the wall um and getting a usb cord a long one that can go to it and then i will um i will come back to it oh i hear footsteps i think it's time for me to go um and so stay tuned for more um i will be back hopefully every saturday 10 a.m eastern that's kind of my plan but uh here here's a plea to you please join the discord um it is the best place to get up updates on when i'll be live streaming and when new videos are coming out um that when you join the discord for the first time you need to go to the readme where there's the code of conduct and react with an emoji and that will unlock all the channels for you um and um but that you know this is my my ambition for this semester is fridays recording the sequence tutorials saturdays doing side projects um saturdays will be live streams the fridays will not be live stream but you can sort of like listen in or tune in as a member but you know you're not missing out if you're not a member everything's going to be published as video tutorials for everybody to see um so um so that's kind of my plan thank you for tuning in i hope i didn't hope this was enjoyable or interesting to you i did very very very little today um and um so hopefully this you i enjoyed saying hi to you and being back and live streaming it's so easy for me to live stream from the attic i almost want to say like i'll just be back a few hours later this afternoon i'll turn it back on but knowing how things are uh that's probably not gonna work so um please uh thank you for supporting the channel um if you are a member i'll say quickly that we have a whole new system for sending out the stickers and various things uh if you were hopefully some of you are receiving them as we speak if you do receive them please post in the rewards channel and discord in the members channels um or get in touch with me or um on discord post there if you're wondering about the status of it we got a database and a notion set up for that and uh jason uh who does the illustrations is working on some new stickers and mailing those directly so a lot of the a lot of systems are going for that that hopefully will be much better than in years past um and the discord invite link again i see that um anashir is asking i'm gonna press a little button and show it

so and their new game uh that they love is called fall guys i just want to see if i got that right yes this is definitely it but then we did they play it on steam on the pc yeah i think this is it so

more link i will post it um to the discord um and uh you can join and chat i'll like basically be like in the chat like i'm happy to answer like coding questions while they're playing this game so in theory that's what we're gonna be doing i mean i need to take a break to walk the dog and eat something hopefully they weren't playing video games all this morning because i told them do other stuff when i went downstairs briefly during my break they were like they were like the most idyllic angelic children i wonder if they were like not doing something else and then quickly got into position but they were both like lying on their bed they share room lying on their beds with like reading quietly as if literally as if like they were doing something else and as i walked out like switched to doing that i think they were legitimately doing that um and then hopefully we'll go outside um to the park and all other stuff today i can't stop talking i love this so anyway so uh stay join the discord uh if you want to like check that out uh uh later okay uh walk the dog the dog hopefully hasn't like peed somewhere it's been a really long time i took her out at 8 30. it's been quite a while
