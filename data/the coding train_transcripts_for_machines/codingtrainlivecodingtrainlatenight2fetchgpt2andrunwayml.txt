oh hello and good evening welcome to another late night edition of the coding train with me internet weirdo dan Schiffman now I had earlier today Oh plan and thought about what I was gonna say at the very moment I'd switch the camera over myself and I completely forgot what it was right now you know I actually have enough room here on this table in between the camera and where I'm sitting that it could have like a little bit of a teleprompter so again I'm looking for some writers to write me some scripts that I will read to you actually better yet ultimately the plan here eventually is for me to just have an AI model a machine learning model generate the script for me so that's that's coming I mean I it'll make oh you might think that will make any sense but it's it's hard to not make nearly as much sense as I don't make Cheers so as with most latenight shows this is not a show nor it is late at night oh boy I can't bring myself to do this why don't skeletons ride rollercoasters they don't have the stomach for it why does a moon rock taste better than an earth rock well I don't like this one because it's a little meteor I feel like you know some of you might that one's no good let's boo that one good what do you call a fake noodle and imposter what time is it I don't know it keeps changing actually fortunately here we go we've got our countdown clock going because as you know once it gets to zero o'clock I turn into a creepy looking AI artificial intelligence pumpkin all right I don't think I'll go with this anymore we need to get ourselves centered we need to feel ready that we can be here together in moments here to make some fun interesting coding projects late at night from my home here in Brooklyn my children are fast asleep to be honest I seriously doubt they're asleep but they're in their room quiet I can't hear them they can hear me apparently last night I was told yeah we can hear you you're kind of loud so there it is but just before they went to bed I got out my usual night time reading the book a million random digits with one have't 103d is 12 it is way past your bedtime young person 3d hmm oh I hear something so all of you who are past your bedtime and just about to go to sleep I will now read to you from my book of random numbers thirty four thousand nine hundred and ninety sixty two thousand one hundred and twenty two oops oops oops we have to take a break here Lucas Chang Lucas Chang what was it that I was using yesterday for the member what it was this breaking news we have a message from Lucas Chang Lucas Chang says thank you well thank you Lucas Chang this random number goes out to you 2639 fortyfour thousand two hundred and seventy three fifty seven thousand six hundred and seventy eight thirty four thousand five hundred and fifteen fourteen thousand one hundred and seventy six ninety one thousand five hundred fifty to eighty nine thousand four hundred and twenty four fifteen thousand two hundred and thirty six fifty three thousand nine hundred and fortyseven and thirty four thousand four hundred and fortyeight well I like to read from my book of random numbers at the start of my coding train the night train late night with the coding train just to make sure that if you're watching you have the chance to leave tomorrow actually one thing that I said yesterday I said that if you come back tomorrow you can actually check the video's description and they'll be time codes in there and the time codes might indicate where something that you might actually want to watch happened unfortunately didn't get to that with yesterday's show so maybe maybe it will be true tomorrow maybe it won't it's really I really don't know I just don't know this ginger tea is delicious I'm drinking it out of my Highclere Castle hug yes I have a hiker class all right so what is this why are you here why are you watching this I don't know like I've said probably too many times at this point I encourage you to go to bed some of you interestingly enough might just be waking up in the morning depending on where you are in the world you might be having your morning coffee a little I don't know morning toast whatever you eat for breakfast I wish you a wonderful day exercise meditate I'm not sure but if you choose to stay with me here for the next 51 minutes I can't see the chat anymore I've got to fix this there we go Anthony is asking if I'm okay you know it's a really weird thing to be by yourself in a room with some bright lights on you a camera your computer feeling like there are a few hundred people watching and you really have no idea what to say or what to do one of these days maybe I will have my act together and I will have a plan and a script and segments and all those things but for now I'm just here and the the idea here with coding train late at night just to switch you over to my laptop for a second is that I have a list of sort of strange weird projects I'm interested in working on they are found in this coding train latenight github repository and last night we made the midnight pumpkin alarm so I can add myself here so oh but it's over there look at this I had this fixed last night this wasn't working the midnight pumpkin alarm which was right above me and I had a suggestion here thank you too let's pull up this pull request which has now been merged from Joe Pesci Joe Parris who says add ideas for using I Can Has dad joke to fetch a joke as a discord bot command and possibly displaying that joke on screen during the stream and oh that is a great idea but I think I could do one better here so my goal for tonight by the end of tonight is to have a machine learning model generating new dad jokes so that's what we are here to make it's not exactly on the list maybe we'll have those appear as an overlay maybe not but certainly it will become if I could just get back ok this lav mic thing does not fit in my pajama bottoms yes I might be wearing it because it's one of the things that allows me to get to a dressed up at 1100 I think you shower I comb my hair [Laughter] I have to say here's the wonderful thing about this I one of the things I'm really enjoying about this strange time that we're living in it's complicated and tricky as it might be is learning new stuff with my kids my daughter is obsessed with parrots so I learned so much about parrots day even so much that I took a walk to the Greenwood Cemetery I live not too far away from the Greenwood Cemetery here in Brooklyn New York where there is a nest of Monk parrots and there's all sorts interesting stories of how they ended up there I won't go to too much about this but I saw the monk parrots today and OH Juan Carlos Ponce come Poussin oh and there's some new members there's so much going on welcome new members and friendly super chats there's absolutely no reason why you should join the coding train as a membership or pay money for a super chat I really should just disable that but it is most appreciated by yours truly and with your membership you have won yourself a random number thirty two thousand eight hundred and nine what I was saying about the parrots well I don't want to go on and on about the parrots but I'm pleased joying my day times and doing this late night hour of livestreaming it makes me feel like I'm doing something in my socalled professional professiona now as I like to say life I owe Juan Carlos an email back about something you emailed me I think about the nature of codebook and I'm so like did I write back I don't remember but all of my thumb's are thumbs thing upping thumbs up with regard to everything that you said there I'm really really slow with email I would say these days but I'm just gonna always slow in it all right so I want to get started with this project that I want to make and so I think what so there's so much that I want to get to here and ultimately I have these Hewlett's behind me that blink I want to be able to control them from p5.js I want to get everything that I'm doing here available as the discord bought so once I've got this dad joke generator ai generator that could be a Bop you could ask for a new joke but for today let's just see if we can get it working so and we do have our countdown going the AI pumpkin generator is not active right now because I really meant to secure it during the day but I didn't have any time to do that because I don't do anything during the day but learn today I learned about what what's the math we were doing why can't I not remember oh yes we were the math that I did today was we had it was a it was a word problem where we had a truck and we had to save animals from the rainforest we could only hold ten thousand pounds in the truck and the animals weighed certain amounts we had to figure out what's the way we could get the most animals in the truck and not go over ten thousand pounds so instead of cleaning up the late night repo and adding time codes and getting the machine learning model so that's what I worked on today and I went to go see the barracks all right now and I should mention that if you want to ask questions or get help with your code or engage a little bit with the coding train community thank you David Friedman please huh it's blinking I'm so excited um please come and say hello in the discord which I will now post a link to in the chat okay so let's get going here so this is the website I Can Has dad joke you don't see it I'm gonna bring it up right now and there is an API so my plan is where do I find the API right so we can we can we can get another random joke why did the Clydesdale give the pony a glass of water because yeah that's about right okay so but I want to go straight to the home page and find the out go to the API and figure out how to use this API so my plan is first let me just get a p5 sketch asking for a joke and displaying it in the console like that's really all I want to do right now I just want to like figure out how's the AP API work then I want to build maybe a node node script that'll just get like a thousand I don't know how many I mean maybe there's some way and when somebody's looking into this whoa I'm livestreaming maybe there's some way I could just download the full database of dad jokes from this API but oh and I could even just use curl that's interesting so I could probably write a script but anyway so but I want to do this in JavaScript then I want to create a big text file with as many dad jokes as I can possibly fit and then I'm going to train a machine learning model with all of that data and see if I can generate some new jokes all within the next 43 minutes yeah prathamesh writes in the chat automate the random number giving tradition so that when anyone becomes a member it does the work so one thing by the way does anybody know if CJ is still streaming um so a friend of the show coding garden with CJ wonderful channel I noticed was livestreaming maybe like an hour or so ago and the reason why I thought of this is I want to do some stuff with the YouTube chat API but I hear it's kind of like a big pain to deal with and I I probably should just move to streaming on twitch but I'm just gonna keep saying that I'm probably never actually do it but so I'm a little bit hesitant to work with the YouTube chat API but I think that that's why I kind of want to use the discord as sort of like the chat that we can interact with okay so everyone's telling me that CJ is still streaming so hopefully uh yeah I highly recommend right now go to twitch let's actually just go to coding dot garden and this is the coding garden and maybe coding garden on YouTube here I don't know why there's not a link to the twitch here because that I believe is where coding garden streams but if we go right here we can bring up so this is where you should be going to learn this is where you should be going to learn stuff and have watch a sensible live stream with people with actual notes is that coming through all right I'm gonna look at this green screen so many wonderful things are okay but I'm gonna keep going with what I'm doing you can choose to stay and make no guarantees all right so first thing we're gonna do is I have got I have got a p5 web editor sketch and we get rid of draw I'm gonna see if I can fetch a joke just with this load JSON function so the load Jason so I'm gonna buy at some point if I'm really doing this every night I don't know if it really makes sense for me to like explain what p5 is over and over and over again but just very quickly p5 is a JavaScript library for creative coding find out more p5 JSON org it's from the processing Foundation which is a nonprofit that I do a lot of work with and I encourage you to learn more about all that stuff I know I know oh I remember I remember this was my new thank you to the members there we go okay but all right all right everyone I forgot all of my new tricks and bits all right so now here we go so if I go over to the API it looks like I can just throw myself over here a fetch a random dad joke except application JSON except as text interesting the end point will only ever return there's a slack app hmm as JSON J joke idea oh so there's a specific joke ID that's interesting /j fetching joke is text as an image that's interesting search oh oh so could we search and just get a whole bunch total jokes 307 total pages 15 and we have to learn about oh well this is what I should just do just to get a whole bunch right like if I see that this is possible doesn't this mean that I could just go to like I term for example oh my goodness I have not set this up yet so one thing that's a little bit of an issue is that Owen this silly can I get rid of that overlay here no or like could can I move it around let's just I don't know there's a clock I'll put it right onto the clocks gonna be nicely redundant well look CJ is here or CJ is watching my stream well I just got a message from CJ I made this Express API that turns the YouTube live chat atapi into a socket IO API why is it that anytime I ever want anything in the world CJ has made it yesterday I thought wouldn't be nice if I had just a list of the coding train color palette and then like a website appeared within like less than five minutes maybe I'd see J everybody's subscribed okay oh shut up all right so here we go there's a few things that I really really require you did reveal to yours to use let's let's let's get crackin here setting up I turn where's the small tiny preferences that I need doesn't look anything like what I want profiles reuse previous sessions directory this is a very important setting that I must now I will go to text twentyfour points is my favorite size that work does that change anything and the other thing that I must have the setting that I love the most they will stick with enormous a penis that makes my coding life complete is whenever I resize the window no no whenever I resize the font using it keep them in don't want the window to change its size look how horrible it is when that happens those well can I make it yeah right and look wait look at that the window is getting bigger I do not want that to happen I cannot tolerate it could not tolerate it so I must go here and behind the setting window arrangement oh wait window terminal session advance somebody must know somebody must know yeah no no selection window I found it oh right I just uncheck this and everything is great look at that pick up a guy can make the fun this is awesome right now I'm getting a lot done here 35 minutes left people I'm almost to the point where I have the fonts it's set in my terminal so speaking of C maybe I'll pick a different twitch channel or YouTube channel or coding something or other to refer to constantly in tomorrow tomorrow night did I say that I was gonna be back tomorrow night oof but I do happen to know that CJ recently did a video all about setting up their new dev environment and I wanted to follow all of those steps but I think for a lack of a better idea right now I'm gonna very very quickly get oh my zsh which is the shell the sh s the shell that i like to use and this is a particular configuration of it that has some nice syntax highlighting and various things so I'm going to paste this in and it should be there now that looks good I think it can be a little bit bigger I can't a little smaller that is I can see where I am what is going on with the font all right so now we're good why was I oh right I was on the this let's see if this curl command works so that works so in the one hand I could just I could skip everything that I'm doing right now just to send this into a text file I mean so how do isn't there a way that you do something fancy where you do this and then you do this and you say like file dot txt like right over here there's some kind of like pipe the results of this into a file this can't possibly be right right like what I've got over there can't possibly be right but let's let's try it well it did something oh look at that okay well first of all for you to be able to see this I don't really have my layout stuff going well look at that it's there if Kat will show me what the contents of the file are whoops huh okay that worked that worked alright so let me open this up let me look at this file so here is now a text this is what I need to train my machine learning model okay I enjoy this way too much what did one night say this is what I've not heard before what did one not say as he chased another nut I'm a cashew okay now the question is if I do this again if I do this again where how come my commands not there if I do this again and I say like file 2 dot txt do I have the same jokes file 1 yes so I got a do like I got to do pagination through it so I really should do let's let's get it as JSON because I want to see so are there really only 307 jokes no 650 with the total pages of 32 so I could in theory get all 650 of these jokes so you know what let's skip the whole p5 step where I was gonna use lo JSON and just display one joke we got to move along here it's already 1130 p.m. at night and I didn't go to sleep till 2 a.m. last night I mean I finished at 130 I think I finished at one thing no no 1230 no I went to sneak up one I don't even remember what time it was I was just wandering aimlessly throughout the house bumping into things let's throw caution to the wind and do something perhaps ill advisable but fun times let's go and set up a node script to do this so the way that I'm going to do that is let's let's just head over to the desktop let's make a directory called joke scraper and we will say NPM in it so this is the point of the program where I say now note is the thing that's blah blah blah and PS the thing that blah blah blah but it's late at night don't be fooled by the tie that I'm wearing I cannot possibly begin to explain any of that but I do have a set of video tutorials most notably I would probably recommend you take a look at my working with data and api's serious so I'm kind of jumping into the middle of that by creating a quick node a node project and you know interestingly enough it would be interesting I kind of want to do some stuff with deploying stuff to glitch but getting out of myself NPM in it and the way that I like to use NPM NIT is like this okay I think I could enter enough times I did learn probably from CJ this is the channel where you watch somebody who does all the coding stuff incorrectly in case you're wondering that there's a way that you can set up a template but I've got this now I'm going to open up in Visual Studio code that worked apparently had already installed this I'm gonna get my code open here I've got package.json let's make the font size bigger here now this is where I really would like to go and this is where I would definitely like to go and take a look at what CJ did in setting up Visual Studio code time for that because it's 1130 right now get this moving it's gonna take like two hours to train the machine learning didn't prebaked one usually if I'm doing something with training process is gonna take a long time I will pre do it and then like go through the steps but not this time all right let's make a do whatever it wants us to do we're gonna make a new index.js file and now what I want to do is use fetch along with a sink and a weight which is all stuff that I've covered in my video tutorials to get this exact page but I want to see this page in my node code so let's give that a try oh my god oh my god that's four spaces if that four spaces are a tab or something no no no stop stop chain into two spaces my whole life no chief you change convert two spaces I fix this thanks everybody the four spaces they scare me it's too many I know some people find it comforting but I go will you help me will you help me I can't go on look at the clock just ticking away ticking away ticking away aah violet has this really excellent idea which is that I don't think I'm gonna do that this this round but I could make a conversational like chatbot by segmenting out the joke and the punchlines and so I could actually that would be great for you to ask a question to the bot and it would try to give you a funny answer I love that idea click on it select spaces option then select two spaces okay I can handle this everybody click change view okay all right here we go so we're gonna make this an async function Oh fetch isn't natively a node right is there some new thing called like Axios that I'm supposed to use I saw that flying across the screen one day as I was sitting at my computer I don't really know what that is but I might learn about it fetch where is this fetch this know if this is gonna give me JSON I'm gonna wait this fetch let's see if this works so now what do I need to install I think it was like no fetch that I use let's look we're working with data and api's coding train look at this how convenient these nice tutorials but I want to see once I start using node server sided with node post with fetch this one will definitely have it let's look at the code looks like what I used was note fetch so that's what I'll use okay so that should have added that too yep note fetch is added there and also yeah so let's try running this well my lights are blinking we have a new member hi welcome to the coding train all aboard on the night train it's a quiet place a strange place a place with people like me who feel confused why are they here what's the point of it all do I even know what I'm doing this thing didn't work at all but you've joined and I thank you and for that I would like to offer you a random number which is 80 1754 now why didn't this work ref fetch is not defined oh so I can't just install node fetch and suddenly use fetch I also visit but this is the point of the book them I've just copy pasting code from previous things that I alright so I need to make sure I have the require statement because I'm using this particular library okay we've got something so that's good can I is it actually in JSON format let's see let's take a look and see if this works so now I could convert it to JSON and here we go so I think that I don't know how with fetch to tell it to do this thing is this some kind of like header header I must need a header yeah I've done that before that's a thing so maybe the H means these are the headers and this is telling me to give me back the data in JSON so let's see fetch with headers using fetch fetch there fetch a weight fetch your ah so I can put an object in like this as the second argument so let's try this let's make a variable called options and I should say oh wait a wait fetch and just pass in the options and then I don't need to worry about any of this but what's what's going on here okay I need this for headers whoa that's right yeah and the header that I want must be I'm assuming where's that page oh here it is accept application JSON and no idea if this is what I'm supposed to do except what we think what's the chance this is going to work all right now how do I tell it I want the next page so the current page is one the next page is two so I could say let I must I guess I could do some kind of loop here right I mean I kind of know this is silly so I probably should do the pagination more okay so the optional query string parameters so Oh max 30 so I might as well get 30 so let's just see if this works so I should be able to add let's just because of how hard it is to see all this code let's make a separate variable for the URL and then so that's the URL then let's add some query string stuff so I'm gonna use my template literal my absolute favorite thing in the world and question mark limit equals 30 well I could just do a string there I mean the reason why cuz I think I'm gonna change the page so let's just see what happens there okay so total pages is 21 right to my left or right or however you're looking at it total jokes is 650 so I want all the pages so so I think this is a little bit so this is not such a great idea but I think what I'm gonna do is just hard code in make this back to a string literal and page equals and then I'm gonna have a counter like I and out here I will put a nice little loop and we're starting with page 1 and we go all the way up to page 21 I would assume I plus plus I can type yes I can and now what console.log that oh I don't have any sort of auto format on save it's okay I can manually I could make the indentation whatever I like there we go there we go some fun here we go alright this seems to be working I'm getting all the pages came through so the jokes all come in a property called results so all I need to do is once I have the results I want to say let jokes equals json dot results for every look I'm gonna I'm gonna throw a caution to the wind you'll never see me do this you think you're gonna think like what's what's what's he gonna do what's that coding train Dan person on the internet going to do he is going to write a for loop with a counter no jokes dot for each that's right for each I'm using a higherorder JavaScript function for each joke I'm using an arrow syntax is that how it works is yeah no yeah yeah yeah for each joke then I want to have an array called all jokes and I'm gonna say all jokes dot push joke then I want a console.log all jokes I'm feeling a little bit like I need some music okay who knows if this is correct cuz I never use for each next thing you know I'll be using some kind of what are these things called oh so late it's almost midnight the pumpkins are coming to me well joke needs to be in parentheses I don't think so I think Jo doesn't need to be in parentheses if there's only one argument to the function we'll see alright here we go oh whoops this doesn't look good oh no no no but I want the text of the joke it worked I want joke joke this is so funny the more times I can write joke the more it'll be funny no all right all of the jokes then now all I need to do is say at the end here let's make this what's this doing all in here then what I'm going to do is say I need file system so node has a built in a file system module and I believe I can say file system right file sink right file I like to use right file sync because I don't believe in asynchronous functions only use them what I have to and it needs the file and a data and some options so the options might must be like the encoding the data is all the jokes and the file is my file name so I'm going to say jokes dot txt I want to write out all jokes but I want to join them I think there's looks like in the array there were already like carriage returns and line breaks so I don't think I need to add that in oh no no that's if it's a oh look at that oh wait a sec no no no no I need to separate out mmm shoot all right I'm gonna have to think about this because I thought I could have every joke so I think I need to actually remove so what I what I really want to do is eventually be very thoughtful about cleaning and preparing this data set and understanding that jokes can be multi line and each joke I have like a specific separator between the jokes I think runway allows me to have my own separator so let's create our own let's see if this works with creating our own separator so I am going to join them all with dollar sign dollar sign dollar sign parenthesis so this is going to be my own separator in that's going to mark each new joke eventually if there's a call in response to the joke I might want to separate those but let's just do that and I want to have the file format be utf8 which you know has something to do with it being plain text so let's see if this works out I don't need to console.log the jokes anymore and looks like we've got a text file and it's got a bunch of jokes in it with these weird separators all around okay so this looks pretty good time for us to first of all I do have a pot of tea for my Highclere Castle mug like by the way so my laptop computer is literally right below these two objects this is a horrific idea and by the way the reason why oh my god just hit the soundbar by accident the reason why this laptop computer has no stickers on it whatsoever is because I spilled liquid all over it I had to send it to be repaired and they supposedly it's the same machine but the entire screen this sort of like section of it was replaced so if you have any good stickers you want to send me or suggest that I purchase they have like you know rainbows and are colorful with like flowers and you know the stuff that I love you know what I like okay let's let's bring up runway and so runway is a piece of software that allows me to work with various machine learning models and it has a new feature which allows you to train a model you do have to have a subscription to runway in order to be able to do the training but I want to train a new text model I'm gonna call this a dad joke generator and I'm going to look at all of the other weird data sets that I already have here I meant to create a totally separate account for a live streaming but whatever I am going to get this jokes file the data set is too small no I insist trade my model anyway I don't care isn't really not gonna let me oh this hope lad is going terribly you think you think you could defeat me you can't defeat me I will defeat you yeah it's right remember that shuffle function I wrote yesterday oh yeah yeah just watch this yeah I've got you now look at me creating lots of extra data by just duplicating my data over and over again in a different order which makes no sense because it's all segmented alright so hold on here we go let's just say let's do this one hundred times have to make this work how to not do machine learning correctly how to not speak in English language okay alright now we're gonna make our text file quite a bit bigger by putting all the seat jokes in there under times that's right I mean how come how come run away clothes did I close it I'm a train a model it's gonna be text we're going to call this dad jokes I'm going to upload my much larger joke dataset now it's very happy look at it look how long if that's a huge file oh my goodness whoa I have so many jokes I have five megabytes of jokes amazing next so I need to use a data set separator which I thought let me do a custom one let me do a custom one I have this memory be able to do that all right so I got to go back and redo this let's do it this way let's have all the jokes replace I forgot how to use replace in JavaScript well I can use a regular expression I just say replace I think all I want to do is replace wherever there is what was it was it slash are slash end with nothing and then I'm gonna had join the text just with a line break so we'll use a line break as a separator okay let's take a look at this file alright this looks good every joke is on a new line there was the one there was one that was multiline well I'm like why are they the jokes the same wait a second here hold on SEC I'm tired is the first joke and then it's the third no no no no no no oh because it repeats the first set of jokes multiple No hold on a second here yes I'm not I'm duplicating it in the array over and over again all right all right everybody all right we're gonna I think we're good okay now back back we're going to delete this data set we're going to get it again and we've got our jokes next and then the data separator is definitely a line and training time oh yeah estimated trading time an hour it's okay I got four and a half minutes okay here we go okay here we go let's let's see what happens it's so I need to I think I may need to turn the air conditioner open the open a window all right your experiment is starting this can take a few minutes hmm what can I do while we're waiting let's let's take a look at my list of projects that I want to work on I felt like this went better last night hold on let's let's uh let's take a little break for a minute while I am letting this go so we're gonna have a quick intermission I will be right back in just two minutes all right so I'm really waiting for this ETA to appear and according to my I should just admit that this stream goes until 1230 right soon we're gonna find out how long it's gonna take I'm reading the chat please oh hi yes oh all right so violet writes as soon as you say it goes till 1230 it'll start um let's look into some other stuff while we're waiting for this to go let me look at my list here because I'm gonna need to figure out some stuff so um a couple things I could work on I could start trying to download all my YouTube transcripts but let's look I think I want to get this thing further along live poll overlay would be a large project if I could add a minimum sort of start to begin looking at how I would control these hue lights behind me and that could be interesting to try also like what was that where did CJ let's look at CJ's YouTube live chat API let's take a look at that real quick I think that could be a useful thing for me to take a quick peek at so I think if I go to github.com slash coding garden is our two G's encoding garden that's an interesting question I there is oh wow let's let's take some time to look at these vs code settings let's look at these all right so these are oh this is a lot of stuff for me two settings I'm totally overwhelmed keybindings okay I can't I can't deal I can't handle this it's too much for me but maybe these are some things I do like is I do like the bracket pair colorizer so maybe I will grab that one let's install that while I'm here okay let's open this up let's install that and probably what I really want to install is get something to do like some nice code formatting for me yes Lin so I think I want to integrate es lint for sure so let's install that okay now do I need beautify as well if I have es lint okay I guess I do want beautify so let's install that and then I think the setting that I want is the format on save which sometimes I turn it off but I'm going to put that in and let's just see now if okay good all right what happens if I do this yes okay so I've got a few more things set up in Visual Studio code learn about multiple cursors in vs code writes Chris they will blow your mind all right house how's that how's the how are things going in runway we'll see we'll see alright now what was Oh let's start looking into the hue lights so one of my colleagues at New York University teaches a class called light and interactivity so and has a set of tutorials about how to control hue lights so let's I think let's see if I can find this so let's take a look here like hue control I think this is what I'm looking for yep okay this is perfect so to get started programming hue apps you'll need a hue hub I have that you'll want a hue account too I have that keep the hue developer site handy every hue has a debug interface available at this replace the address with your hub's IP address so now the question is I think if I use my local network IP address here in a live stream there's nothing anybody can do with that so I should be able to grab microphone I'm wondering if I have a Google like WiFi mesh network thing and I wonder if I look at my WiFi app if I can get the IP address of the hue hub so unfortunately you can't see what I'm looking at right now but it is finding all the devices or 23 devices and I see I see a bunch of devices I'm looking for one that says hue hub Philips hue Philips hue bridge is that the same as the hub looking at that details I have its IP address so let me take this oh wait obviously I need to now I need to go and replace this with the local network IP address which is one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot eighty 6.35 alright awesome I've got the hue API debugger right here cool oh you know cuz I made the text file large that's why it's taking a long time yeah this by the way the machine learning model is not gonna work well I'm gonna need to do something more extensive to get more jokes so if you have ideas for that you can let me know file them as issues so if you have more I need to build up a joke and I please familyfriendly jokes I don't want stuff that's obnoxious that's meanspirited familyfriendly jokes I will manually curate them I think in the end but if you go to the late night repo I can I'm gonna file an issue here need more jokes I am building a database a dataset of jokes dad jokes family friendly the work the the more grown inducing the better wait please help me with links to places I can find more starting with 650 from here I can has dad joke alright so you can add some comments or ideas beer beer jokes are welcome definitely beer jokes are quite welcome alright so now looking back at this you can send you can use this to send API commands to the hub to test things out so what's the first kind of API command I can send device type my app username new username okay API device type my app so if I put this in there and then press a link button on the hub and click post oh I have to go press the link button on the hub okay so I have to walk over to the hub and press the button do you think that's gonna work I'm gonna walk over to the hub and then I click put what happens I just click post right now okay unauthorized user okay alright I am going to take my microphone and walk over to where the hub is it's in the next room I assume you can still hear me I'm walking over to it walking over to it quietly and pressing the button you can hear me press the button you press the button nothing happened on it do I need to hold down the button more well I'm gonna walk back walking back and now oh oh oh right I was reminded here that I needed to get rid of this one two three four and now let's do post AHA username now this is probably something I shouldn't be showing you do you think I mean I don't understand why and how you would use this because it's I don't think maybe it's accessible from sigh but I don't know this seems like a bad idea that I have this on the screen so I'll just leave it much longer to make sure I give you as much time it's possible the type at all eh all right so I did that now you user command and then ah okay to turn on light one so let's see if I can do this so so I want to get all of the so now I can do on now I can put that user and I've already shown it to you so I'm sure I can reset this value so this goes now here that's my username and then I could put something like lights and it's going and click get and it'll tell me the state of all my lights ok so I am going to click get but before I click cat I'm going to just put myself here and so that just in case it has some like private information doesn't really look like yeah so there's it doesn't look like there's anything really private here there's just a lot of information I can kind of like show you I'm gonna look for the coding train because I have some lights called coding tray and there we go all right so I'm going to come back to here and so up here you can see I have an extended color light called coding train hue lightstrip plus that's what's actually right here behind me and this is some information about what color it is and so now if I go back to here to turn on how do I know what number it is on true so how do I know what number it is if it's light one what like light number is it is it do I go further up like five so it's light five ah look at this light five so now I believe it's late five so I'm gonna go here to like five and we'll go back to here and I'm gonna cheat change this to change this to 5 yeah State user lights / 5 sorry / 5 / state and on true or on false so let's see and is it a poster again Oh put it's a put that's what's a put oh it went off oh my God look at this true okay look behind me oh boy so does this mean can I just how do I do a put with like HTTP on HTTP request there's an island out HTTP GET HTTP POST those are things I understand what's H what's a put put versus post uploading stuff to a particular overriding what is already post on there's way of submitting data so can I do a put method put no problem so absurdly I'm gonna go back to my node program and let's go to this is not gonna take that long actually for me to create a disk or bot that controls the lights which won't be happening tonight but that's that's what I do want to work well I'm gonna check on our jock trainer but I'm gonna create a light controller I'll just call it lights and as you know that's how I like to do my NPM in it hit enter as many times as I can we're gonna go to here I'm going to create index J s and now I'm going to do the same exact thing that I did in the joke scraper so I want to use probably fetch in the file system I'm gonna say like light on well here what am I doing here Hugh let's write a function async let's call to you and why is it back to four why is it back to four that's so sad somewhere there's a default in these settings okay node hue API oh I could just use the node hue API this is silly so I was gonna use fetch to do a put and probably if I kept reading Tom's page and it's probably let's look at this one I could use the node hue API so this probably makes more sense for me to use this right so I suppose but the think problem is I'd have to learn this ID IP address Oh interesting alright let's try using this so let's what is this called yes by repeater Marie has made this so why not just use this does this look like an L last commit six days ago that's a very good sign so I think it makes sense for me to look at this let's see we've got some nice information here I'm gonna install it so this is definitely something I'm going to come back to and work on more I kind of actually liked Tom's sort of simplified explanation because I can do this let's just see if I can get the basics I want to see if I can get a light to turn on and off then the pumpkins will come for me and so this is what should be an environment variable it's too late for me I'm gonna see if I can reset the username after tonight it's probably a way I can do that but I will just put it hard code it into my code right now and let's get the address which was this and then let's see if we can search for the bridges Oh oh I don't I don't need note fetch hue API is not a constructor huh well I'll have to look at the most recent documentation all right um so this is going okay I suppose let's see what's happening with our machine learning model oh it's been running for 23 minutes and it's already got a perplexity score of 40 point 44 oh it finished I waited long enough awesome okay let's see now if I can by the way I'm just curious did the perplexity get worse over time or better oh yeah look at this had this like why does all right so why does the moon rock tastes better than an Earth Rock because it's made of oatmeal I'm definitely gonna have to I'm definitely going to have to like automate the laugh track as well all right so here we go let's let's throw a caution to the wind and take I feel like I should take the model with the lower the the check point with the lower perplexity score so perplexity is a score it's similar to the means it's conceptually we can think of it similar to the way we think about loss so as a machine learning model is training that for doing image classification we would be saying like oh is it is it recognizing images when they're cats as cats and dogs as dogs perplexity is quite a bit different has to do with the way this GPT 2 model works but the same kind of metric applies if it's lower that's better so with it says here you can see with a small data set it is not common for perplexity score to increase over time this means your model is likely memorizing the data rather than learning to generalize patterns it extracts from it this is the case try gathering more data or saving the model using a check point from earlier so let's use this checkpoint I'm gonna click Next I'm gonna change the check point to the one from 250 I'm gonna say set as default then I'm going to add this to the workspace we're gonna call this oh I mean a new create a new workspace coding train late night so let's create this workspace and I've got my dad jokes model let's create an input source which is just text and let's run it remotely I'm gonna allow it to generate let's just so let's do use like the length of a tweet what's a tweet these days 280 characters I forget what top P is oh it's like a cumulative probability above this number so a higher number is weirder stuff so I definitely want to keep the higher number and seed is just you know you if I give it the same prompt it will always give me exactly the same result unless I varied the seed so that's good so let's try let's try writing a joke why did the chicken why did the chicken get invited to dinners dinner was on me this couldn't possibly be better than 280 characters yeah so because we can make a Twitter bot that tells dad jokes that would be fun all right so let's randomize the seed and get another one why did the chicken get a penalty he took it for sage advice I like this little short laugh let's randomize the seed is good why did the chicken get a penalty he to go home with it yeah thank you thank you thank you all right so now what I want to do what was I gonna do with this right I guess I'm gonna generate my script so maybe what I quickly want to do is well all right all right it's twelve twenty three let's get this to be an overlay since that's the thing we're doing these days oh but I've got the same problem with the same security problem so I think what I need to do let's try it this way all right very very quickly let's see if we can host our let's see if we can talk to this machine learning model on glitch and I can store the secret key in an environment variable let's try that okay well this is a terrible idea I'm let me loss sign into glitch and I'm gonna switch to this for a second um here we go okay I'm signed in so I'm signed into glitch glitch if you're not familiar with I I generally like to use the p5 web editor as my goto web editor but for writing code in the browser but if I want to have something that involves node and serverside programming p5 web editor doesn't have that capability but glitch does and then also one of the things oh look at this starter discord well I'll come back to that but one of the things that I can do is I can create a front end with p5.js to display the joke and I can have node fetch the new joke from the model in which case in which case what am I saying and I can keep that hidden so new projects we're gonna call this yeah let's do a simple I'm I'm always afraid to use these templates because it says a simple node app built on Express but oh it's people like what what one person's simple node app is another person's like headache but let's see how glitch does for it oh yes we're creating this project and I'm gonna call this dad dad dad dad jokes oh wow wow there's already a glitch project called dad joke generator well this is good for me to look dad joke eh I um let's call it that okay saved it let's go to environment variables ha comments are visible in remixes make sure there are no secrets in your comments the environment variables for storage secrets in your app like an API key any project member can see the contents but everyone and everyone else can just see the variable names perfect so what I want to do here is I'm gonna go to back to runway I'm gonna stop the model I'm gonna go back to the model where's that option to host it forgot where that is you info make I don't want to make this model public yet I want to host this model dad jokes and I don't know so it doesn't matter to me if you have the subdomain as long as you don't have the secret key so let's grab this and I'm gonna host the model and deactivate it so now I'm going to go to a place where you cannot see my screen anymore and I'm gonna grab the token oh there's a hole well this is new okay hold on there's a hosted model library but is there a note so so one thing that's interesting here that I want to show you without let me grab the code let me grab this first private API key oh I can regenerate the API key so I definitely should do that from yesterday's okay so let's go back here and but when I do the morning show I really have to add this next week I was gonna change to a boarding show and do it at 700 a.m. Eastern but I have to stop it I can't go over but anyway alright so I'm sorry let me get back to my glitch environment variables and I'm going to put in code snippets JavaScript SDK Oh raw let's just use raw JavaScript yeah let's do that because so query the model so I've got that and I'm putting it in let me go back so I know you can't see what I'm doing I'm going to show you in a moment I promise and then oh hey I'm going to glitch back to glitch okay joke I should play some music right now cuz I'm not even talking to you give me a break it's 1230 alright I'm almost ready to show you exercise can show it to you right now so how do I make the font size much bigger I'll just zoom in so this is the code that I want to I want to create a route that if I say slash joke I get a joke back so the way that I do that is the the the secret token has to go here so I need a variable called token and that's the thing I can get out of the environment variables so like if it was just xxxxX I'll call it token and then I think I could just say oh I can just say process env token then in the code so is this there and then if I go to here I can actually just say where was I process env token so this is me putting in the secret token should appear here and now all I have to do is actually go and get that secret token that I don't want you to see and paste it right here in my code you test all right I am very sorry about that unfortunately the batteries died in this mic I will be more conscientious about making sure I have batteries that are fully charged before I begin so that doesn't happen again okay so I don't remember what I was talking about now but I now have Indian I can't click on this I will not oh I will not click on this I will not click on this my environment Oken for accessing the API is in this particular environment variable file so I should be able to just access it now through process env token and not have you see it so I don't need this I don't need this so there's I guess I can leave all this let's see there's a view I'm not going to do any of this nonsense but I guess all what's in public here script uh chess style Dutch yes you indexer cheese yeah okay so this this works okay so I can use this for the as the p5 sketch and this is my server code I know you can't see this how did anybody know on glitch how to enlarge the font size like where the Preferences format this file that's cool that's nice how do i how do I change the font sizes anybody know back to glitch new stuff I don't see a way to do it anyway let's look at the project should show up here I guess there's some errors maybe oh okay starting up and what I want to do is once I've got the generated text okay so I need a prompt why did I'm why I did the chicken then I need max characters should be 280 top P I want to say 0.9 and this will eventually be a random number but let me just make it a thousand right now and then we should be able to fetch and then generate a text encountered and response dot send generated text so I should I probably should buy the pro glitch account so that this works now let's see show in a new window let's try this alright so hopefully this is going to appear at some point try enlarging browser font yeah I was trying to avoid that because I just want it's actually not even letting me do that is there an error like there's how do I find out if there's errors isn't there a console learn how to use this thing terminal aha oh cool Oh so I could actually just run some tests by running the terminal the console in the editor don't automatically sync you can manually one the Refresh command then it will force a refresh updating the editor mmhmm server readme views why is this not like showing up hmm go to sleep glitch is having a major outage right now Oh hmm well that's not good major outage means all right I just want the jokes to appear all right we're gonna do this a different way we're gonna do this a different way trying to think of how this makes sense oh I have an idea here's how we're gonna get the overlay I mean yeah I think I can come back to this how do I want to finish today off return to the pumpkins oh I like to have I feel like I think I have this thing where I feel like I want to complete something whatever I got gonna complete is the wrong word I want to reach a sort of organic happy stopping point I have a little like thing appear on the screen and be done with it let's just actually get the joke to appear in p5 so we're gonna do it this way we're gonna go I'm gonna go back to runway and I'm not sure if what's being shown in runway right now so okay so I'm gonna deactivate my dad joke model and then go back to my workspace and I am going to run the model and then I'm gonna grab that code and just I'm just gonna run it locally so here I am with the model running locally and I can go to network and I can go to JavaScript and I can do oh I did this yesterday didn't I so let's just go back to open up our pumpkins and let's make this a what am i doing duplicate and we don't need any of this stuff we don't need any of this stuff all I want oh I forgot that I is this so let's grab all this stuff and I just want to get joke and ah wrong side sorry everybody now we don't want this model we want I'm going back to runway we want this I want to query it so what I'm doing is querying the model and the input specification is here is this stuff so we have why did the chicken we are going to we want to have 280 characters we want to have top PB 0.9 let's actually have this be a random number between 0 and a thousand so it's a different seed we're gonna post this and got joke then we're going I'm going to say no canvas and function I've got joke results console dot log results so let's see if we can what's this let's see if we can get our joke to appear here in the console why does it have a little error here unrecoverable syntax error that's weird anybody see a syntax error I don't see one strip the semicolon oh yo this is the Sun this is there no semicolon there so this is the JavaScript object doesn't need a semicolon okay let's see if we can get the joke to appear okay oh oh I have to I have to get I have to call get a joke here we go everybody why did the chicken get a pill see he let out a little wine okay so this works and what I'm gonna say is create P results generated text okay so now we should see if I go to file share and get this full screen version but whoops nope that's not the one I want I want the present version why did the chicken coop ever go to school it was all toast why did the chicken get a penalty we let it go why did the chicken pay for his nap you let it go okay so I think let's improve this a little bit by mu let's improve this a little bit by creating an input text input and let's to let joke so oh let's say joke paragraph and so I'm just gonna make a couple Dom elements with nothing in them we'll start with this so this is a little interface here where I can type in a prompt and then it will get the the chicken go to the bathroom it was tender but now what I want is for anytime I'm typing I think that's input dot let's call this prompt from I think the event is actually the event function was called input I could just do changed so whenever I hit enter but let's do what's called get joke and so get joke will now get prompt is it dot value or dot HTML I think it's dot value so I'm gonna get whatever is in the prompt and so now yeah so we're going to oh it's oh no I then I want to update I don't want to do create P I want to say joke P dot HTML and give me the results so let's go back over to here and we're going to type the coding train the coding tray ologists work in concert they teach people 3d printing they teach people to make sprite movements so you might wonder like what how could this possibly have come up with anything related to 3d printing well the truth here is what I'm actually doing is I'm the process of training the model when I was finetuning an existing model so maybe tomorrow night when I come back I could talk more a bit about what GPT 2 is how it was trained and the process of finetuning but I'm there's a lot of existing knowledge it has based on a huge data set of text and the jokes that I'm feeding it are kind of steering it in the direction of what I wanted to generate so why did the chicken is a good like you know why did the fish say hello heaven oh and then so I guess I can't how do I guess I a button would make sense so let's actually let me just change one thing about this let's make a button and and then what I'm actually going to do is the button when it's pressed will get the new joke so why why does Pizza taste bad for you because all the toppings you get why does chocolate do it for lunch no chips it's the munch oh I'm so tired dot dot dot dot dot in this economy why did the for loop why did the for loop succeed because it just took longer to get from first to second base why did the if statement be false because it was why did my code short for lunch catch up yeah how else is very good um I like how light disabled this can you please disable go away yes thank you also let's see let's see I like these like coding jokes coder my code is broken see if it figures out how to do like a like no no it thinks that's the end let's get rid of the period no whoops whoops I lost that alright let's try why did my code break because the changing because why Mike Oh brick somebody's been stealing for my workstation do you have any suspicious files in there thanks it was a catch cuz it was trying to figure out how to use ghastly functions ghastly okay thank you everybody I really appreciate you joining me for this total and complete nonsense I think now what I would like to do music is turn this into a discord bot because we could ask a questions like where are you why are you and it could respond and say like should I use a forloop because that's where it gets messy it is true it prints see takes one sign it takes some time I think nothing but an int it really generates excellent punchlines really really good so I think we could make this much better I think I've stumbled on some gold here we could make this much better I don't know why I was gonna play that III got to say goodbye we could make this much better by working on a better dataset and retraining the model and also I think if a lot of the jokes like as violet suggested if I want to like really think of it as very conversational I could work on building in a my own so I think actually maybe what I was thinking is there isn't a there isn't necessarily a option for a custom delimiter in runway but if what I did was always insert I'm hearing like music somewhere some kind of like delimiter here I could train the model to kind of understand the difference between the question and the answer okay so I'm really hearing some weird noise coming from somewhere it's like freaking out a little bit let's I'm just curious if glitch came back still says major outage let's see if it comes back alright doesn't appear to be coming back so this is this is where we are for tonight this is my ending point let's finish with a little quick round of jokes by the way now I'm realizing that I can't mix sounds on my sound board so I feel like it would be useful to be able to have some nice backgrounds where I tell jokes along with you laughter but this way I've the sound board so I only played one sound at a time but I think that this ultimately this bot or web application whatever should happen should someone should speak the jokes and include a laugh track there's so many possibilities here so I let me take some suggestions from the chat for prompts right now so I'm going to wait for you to give me some suggestions for prompts which I will use why did Dan tell them to have a good day cool toast like why did the robot why did the robot fall on the side he fell on the side they were funny earlier I like the coding one sitting snort really well why does recursion take place in front of you who know G what does the Fox say is pretty good okay I think what I'll do is I'm going to say goodbye and I should let this I should leave you with this generating jokes so I'll generate jokes for a little while for you here and play you out with some music and I am doing this tomorrow will be the last latenight coding train of this week I was kind of thinking of doing it Tuesday Wednesday Thursday night so three nights a week at 11 p.m. although next week I think I might try Monday Tuesday Wednesday morning so I want to do three streams a week I come up with this my plan is planned so I'll see you tomorrow night I just have to say it so that I commit to being here so subscribe if you want to like get a reminder you have to do the like subscribe and bail thing but really could just join the discord what today HTTP GET is a really good one this is a really good one can you see the whole thing yet there we go that's what I'm looking for okay so see you tomorrow everybody we'll be back in just doing more am I turn this into a disk or pot my try to get the hue lights going we'll see please contribute please if you can't only got a suit one a.m. please if you can contribute to the repo if you want to add ideas or places that data suits data sources oh god I can't talk it's the night at the I'm gonna do this stuff this stock this dog the starter this starts I'll never forget the Vista autotuned and the Internet unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound that was invalid syntax i forgot i will use continuously over and over all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first you need to do
