one of the things that's been requested a lot and really excited to talk to you about this today is community projects what does it mean for people watching videos on YouTube learning about code to collaborate together on a project so I have two community projects and I also and that I want to talk about so the first one I want to talk about relates to processing day I've mentioned this before processing day is an event that's happening October 21st at the MIT Media Lab it is a day to celebrate the community that develops and make stuff with processing and p5.js and related things you can see all the people who will be presenting and talking I especially want to encourage you to submit a if you're coming to submit a lightning talk to present a short demo at processing day but one of the things that I've been I am planning to do something live so the thing that I have thought about him thank you to to you and for suggesting this the organizer of processing Community Day is to make an algorithmic design for name cards so anybody who signed up to attend will get a name card and one of the ideas was to put names and on a cloud so if I go to github.com slash coding train and I might be able do a walkthrough later of this and I go to community clouds and thank you to me I am so me me I am so me is helping me now to maintain a lot of the github and code related stuff for the coding train Channel and me I am so me created this really nice system to submit your cloud idea so the idea is that can take this as your inspiration how would you design a generative cloud in p5.js so ultimately I'm probably port the code to processing to generate the SVG files and these are going to be printed with thin black lines so this is not about making a colorful image but rather an algorithmic outline and the names will actually be written in calligraphy so so if you are interested in this take a look at this repository I'm gonna click here on it it this repository controls a github pages site and the what you can do is you can submit your cloud you can either work on somebody else's cloud idea or you can in to submit one by writing a function and naming it and it will turn up in this menu so me I am sue me invented this wonderful system that I'm excited about to use for future collaborative projects and if I just show you really quickly if we look at this code here generators j/s all you need to do is go to this file and write your own functions so you can see this function draws a rectangle oh and then look at this it's even so sophisticated that you can then return some values that about where to draw the text but that's an extra fancy feature I love that feature but really you just need to write your own code here write a function you know I you know maybe you want to try using Perlin noise so you write a function called Perlin noise cloud you register it and you register it with a name and the author and then you call this register if you add this register function you submit as a pull request and it will appear as one of the cloud options so everybody maybe I should do a cloud as the coding challenge but that's what I'm going to do it process the community day so so that's one thing I wanted to mention all you need to do is have a github account and hit this edit button now I'm not signed in so saying it must be signed in and of course you know if you're wondering what's get what's github how could I possibly do this you can watch my video tutorials about that topher is asking what and the name is what drives the cloud shape so this is a good question I'm I have to figure we have to figure this out I think the idea if I'm really thinking about it is just a system that generates a different cloud every time you run the code and the cloud has enough space for somebody to hand write a name in it so you can think of it as like there's a bunch of hello my name is sticker name tags that have a nice little generative cloud printed on them and you write your name inside the cloud it might be something slightly different than that but that's a good way of thinking about what it is I'm asking for people to create and so on the one hand this is a collaborative processor maybe have a community designed cloud but you can also sort of submit your own design and you know obviously if we try to make figure out some appropriate way to give credit to those who have submitted code in the actual cloud design and if I do it as a live tutorial I can maybe give credit during that tutorial so please let me know ok the other community project that you can contribute to is and thank you all so again to me I am so me for making this repository is the twelve O'Clock s repository so twelve O'Clock s is a artwork by John Maeda from the late 90s all made on a I think in this document map OS 9 and released in 1997 the only way to currently run these historical company creative coding this creative coding project from the late 90s is to get like a mac os9 any later or PowerPC and goal on Levin actually did this for a page a blog post for one of his courses at Carnegie Mellon University where he got them all to run and then kind of made some gifts of them so what I would love to do as a community is recreate this exact paid what we're seeing here but instead of gif animations the actual clocks running in the browser so what you can see here if you read this read me will give you more information and if we look at the published github pages you can see this is just a layout for all these clocks but the clocks aren't there right now so this is just a beginning so I would love for us as a community that says one of the inspirations for this speaking of crediting is the recode project recode project org maybe no sold on Matthew Epler Epler recode project let's this is this is a documentation page about it where is the actual link that's Matthew Epler who also by the way has all these great video too girls on YouTube how come I can't find the recode project website someone's gonna be able to help me to find this Rika here we go recode project calm there it is so this is the recode project which is additionally about looking at historical examples of artworks computational artworks made by computers and you know and it's there's a long history of this way that takes way way past you know what I've been doing for the last day over many years and what what people have been doing for me for the years before that and so this is a project where you click on any of these for example let's look at random squares this is one we could probably do here by Charles susuri you can see here is a direct translation and experimental so I don't know if I click on this does this mean we see the translation yeah so this is that a written in processing and this is the artwork so this I would love to do something like this for the twelve O'Clock project
