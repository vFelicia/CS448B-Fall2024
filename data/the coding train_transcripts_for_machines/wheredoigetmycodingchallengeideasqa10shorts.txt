hello I'm trying a new format where I answer your questions you know the ones that you're writing right here the first question I'm going to answer is from weissman1310 I'm interested in taking a concept Theory or algorithm to practice coding however I don't really know how to exactly search for them you just go to Wikipedia and type computer science theory or something like that or is there a better place to look for them online this is such a good question there isn't a magic formula and to be honest most of the ideas that I've been doing recently have come from viewers who have mentioned ideas on Discord or social media or in YouTube comments and I have a GitHub repo called suggestion box where you can file an issue with an idea and I try to pull them from there a lot of the coding challenges actually come from a book called The computational Beauty of nature which I used as an incredible source for my book the nature of code which also is a source for my coding challenges if I could be my own source for coding challenges in the next part I'm going to show you my favorite pocket Handbook of algorithms minute it's not a lot of time
