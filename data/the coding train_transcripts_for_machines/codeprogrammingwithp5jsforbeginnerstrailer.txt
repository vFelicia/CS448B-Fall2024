Hello, and welcome to Code, exclamation point. This is a online set of videos where I my name is Dan, last name Schiffman I am here to teach the basics, the fundamentals of programming. This is a course for total beginners who have never tried programming before. I'm going to use the programming language JavaScript. I'm going to show you how to code in JavaScript. I'm going to use a JavaScript library called p5.js which is like big heart to p5.js. It's a library that has a lot of functionality for a bunch of things, but notably, drawing and animation and interactivity. So I don't know what you're going to make, but by the end, might make a game, an art project, science experiment, a performance. I don't know what you're going to make, but I can't even imagine it, and I'm excited to find out. So come with me, all aboard on the coding train to learn the basics, Code! JavaScript with p5.js.
