let's get to the good stuff all aboard the coding train passenger showcase a great place for you to start is Kathy mcginnis's submission Kathy's included a set of Sliders which allows you to adjust the color palette of the tile as well as a whole range of other designs she's made with wave function collapse check out this version from Jin kuk cha which treats each tile as a single Pixel when a cell collapses to a particular color it propagates out to the neighboring cells to recalculate a new color range with a similar color grid kit designed their own tile system to create an abstract ornamental pattern I really love to see project documentation like this with an explanation of the optimizations performed to strike native version in Python my favorite perhaps is the version that generates a mondrion style painting if you're looking for an example in 3D check out gabra's pretty bad North it's a pretty good north thank you for sharing these beautiful generative artworks next time I'm going to look at the prime spiral challenge it's only one minute
