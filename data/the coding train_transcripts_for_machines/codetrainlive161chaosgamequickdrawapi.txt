okay okay okay okay okay now you can hear me right it's never a kodick train without I know I just got to wait till the chat like the other wait till the chat catches up and realizes that I am talking that you can hear me now ah still talking to himself no joke okay oh I just got to wait for this all right all right let's let's let's let's begin again hello good morning welcome my name is Dan and this is the coding train oh I said so many interesting and important and funny and elusive illuminating and exciting and magnificent things that I cannot possibly remember it's not a coding train if I don't start with my mic muted by accident every once in a while anyway so why am I here what's going on it's Monday I'm wearing a tshirt this couldn't possibly be the coding train it's like cold outside I'm wearing the tshirts see I had a whole thing good morning and welcome to a very special edition of the coding train on a Monday so it's been a while since I've been here I haven't done a live stream for several weeks now I was at this wonderful event that was really fun and exciting called thinker con I'm wearing the thinker con tshirt and so I was not able to livestream on that Friday and then this past Friday it was a holiday here in the United States other what known as a Thanksgiving so I was not able to livestream on Friday and I just I just I felt the the the sort of need to put some ideas to typing onto screen to Internet so welcome so I'm here this by the way is actually live I noticed there was some confusion at the beginning of the chat before asking is this a premiere or is this live you can have something recorded that is premiered live that you can chat with or you could actually be live or I could be live but I'm actually 30 seconds in the past by the time you see it and then you could be watching this it's a point in the future I recorded there's so many possibilities that's so confusing but right now at this very moment I am live here and I am going to program some stuff so I'm checking out the chat so I'm not gonna be here for super long I will go back to my usual Friday schedule I do I am here though to talk about a few things for at least an hour let me open up a web browser and let me first go to something which I'm very excited about so you might have recently remember that I did a challenge a coding challenge where I attempted to create a logo interpreter logo being the programming language invented in 1967 where you can control this little turtle that moves around the screen and make graphics and I did my cruddy little version of it that I thought was my best attempt on my channel and then you the people created something unbelievable so I'm gonna go to github.com slash coding train slash logo so this is the no I'm not signed in but that's fine this is the community version I'm gonna go here to contributors all of these people have contributed code to this version of the logo project and if I go here and click on this live web demo link I will be here and you'll see look at this okay there's like a design there's the actual syntax highlighting there's a little menu here where I can like pick look and it supports color it hexadecimal with repeat and syntax highlighting and I can look at these different I can look at these different things that are here and I could type my own look at this the coding train logo is here this is unbelievable I don't know what this this but does recenter oh that's crazy oh I can like move it around this is just unbelievable I know how to do all this stuff it's unbelievable to me so thank you everyone I'm really excited about the future possibilities of what we can do in this channel using this so so I will try to do this periodically where a particular coding challenge is put into a separate repository that people can contribute to I don't have difficulty managing all this stuff and I'm figuring out new and interesting ways of doing that for example and sometimes someone just emerges the tasteful toasty on github is now the has permissions to this repository to review and merge pull requests so that's really exciting I do also want to mention then though that if you go to the coding train comm and these are the two these are the twopart coding challenges that for any of these challenges you can also submit no you can also so in addition to contributing to maybe a community version if you've made your own version that's hosted somewhere on your own you can submit that as well so I don't know yeah you can see look at this here I think I showed these already but there is a 3d logo experiment that was submitted here which actually look at this this is amazing that submitted by Dave be soft calm which implements a version of logo where you can run it run it with a 3d render oh my goodness so so much amazing stuff ok so I wanted to mention that what else is coming coming so I am going to it is almost December and I am planning to do a holiday extravaganza but waiting mean I have no plan yet and that will be a fundraiser for the processing foundation so I just want to mention that you don't need to wait for the fundraiser processing foundation is a nun forprofit foundation in the United States that supports a variety of initiatives you can see all the information here on the website and if you go here to support you can find a way to support so I will do a fundraiser at some point for processing I think tomorrow is giving Tuesday so pre giving Tuesday announcement there you go ok so the next thing that I'm going to do is the chaos game okay let's move this so many possibilities here oh I like this oh we can make this one look at this oh boy boy boy so many oh ok so the reason why I'm doing this is at the finger con let me let me thank a few people let me open up thinker con here so I want to thank in particular the organizers of thinker con smarter every day Destin if you're not familiar with a smarter every day channel you probably would enjoy it Sabrina Emily and a Henry from minutephysics I don't know why I don't see Henry here and Robert Quaritch from radio lab or the organizers of this conference it was really fun I got to see the festival the spoken nerd which was mindblowing the awesome I mean I am the target audience for that joke it was really fun and I was lucky enough to get to do a short 10 minute demo I did this demo with James loss let's see author of the I think it's the algorithm archive I think that's the name of his project I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that's a project he has a project like this it's got to be the algorithm archive right oh yeah yeah yeah okay and his YouTube channel is Lee iOS OS and I've mentioned I've mentioned his channel before because I used his video on the hypercube to create my hypercube challenge he also has a twitch channel where he does a lot of live streaming so so I'm gonna mention these things algorithm archive thinker Khan so we did a kind of coding competition we had 50 and each program the Chaos game next to each other he was using like Julia and some kind of crazy in VI or something text editor and I was just using my usual p5.js web editor which I'm also going to use right now let me just do this okay and I'm going to call this a chaos game chaos game number file there is also a number file video video which I will reference okay all right so this is what I'm going to do today so Johnny Joestar asks is this not supposed to go on twitch to know so I do not live stream to twitch at one point I was live streaming to to multiple platforms and I for for better or worse I have sort of landed on YouTube as my primary platform for both livestreaming and shorter edited versions of things that happen on the live stream so let's just get started here playing the chaos game oh oh oh before I forget how do I find this okay a doctor circuit I think twitter.com doctor circuit doctor circuit sb espen Sunday Larson is a coded train viewer musician programmer from Norway has his own YouTube channel that you could find created for me music ever that I will premiere at this moment okay thank you spen for this amazing to know how quiet if that was loud super loud or super quiet but I on using that off okay all right let's see Cass game coding challenge this is I think gonna be finally I'm gonna do this in two parts because I'm going to do a really simple version with just a triangle first and then I'm gonna do another version with a more of a variety okay I'm looking for my train whistle here it is alright let me reset I almost want to have a timer here but nothing ever nothing good ever comes from the timer okay the volume was pretty good I wouldn't change it okay all right hello welcome to a cup okay that's okay that's so good okay me me me me me me me me my alright hello welcome to a Cody couch coding challenge last last try last try everybody hello and welcome to a coding challenge the Chaos game doll alright so why am I doing this coding challenge I recently was lucky enough to attend this amazing event finger Con in Huntsville Alabama thank you to smarter every day and the other organizers of thinker con this was a mindblowing event and at this event I was I had the chance to do a live demo of some coding in front of people it's a rocket was nuts was a Saturn rocket look kind of like this and I did this with James sloth who is the author of the algorithm archive has a YouTube channel as well you might remember references to his youtube channel in the have his youtube channel up the iOS OS know what is a hypercube come on seriously seriously what happened to his was always the first one look here's mine how come I don't have my B you too premium on just sign in this is oh boy oh boy don't I have YouTube premium ok everybody just take a moment here we go here we go there we go learning is something I've always enjoyed ok hold on a sec I want to thank the right people here don't worry this is this is all gonna happen in a moment but if I have a little okay so Destin Justin smarter everyday Sandlin Dustin's sand Lynn Henry Henry minute physics I got to get everybody's name that I want to thank Henry Reich Emily graslie Emily graslie Sabrina Cruz Robert Krulwich okay yes I'm using an invisible computer isn't that amazing this is my my script over here I have a script okay how can I hold on I'm just gonna add let me let me do this you you've got to realize that half the time on the coding train live is just me taking care of stuff that I need to take care of so I'm over here and let's say I have YouTube where do I find my YouTube premium that I'm logged in over here and then I have like family sharing so family premium family so I have this manage so how do i yeah family sharing settings one two three four five six you can share with up to six members so I just need to share listen you two delete add a family member so my family member now I have a new family member it's coding train choo choo coding train choo choo at gmail.com and send join my family now I have no idea what's gonna happen here so I'm whoops I am going to now I'm going to just I'm gonna do this for a second I forgot to have a keyboard shortcut for this ah there we go I am going to go into the email I don't I just want to I don't know what's in the email of that account have never logged into it you're invited to join a Google family group accept invitation get started join family welcome to the family everybody so now if I go here and it refresh learning there we go alright no more ads thank you okay uh now remember how I was about to do a coding challenge it's like ten fifty I don't have any water okay here we go everyone back to select channel chat yes okay Oh where's my alright okay here we go actually maybe what I should do is know sorry everybody here hold on this is the actual code from thinker con which might make sense for me to start with this let me just get rid of some and of course I made some silly err counters not to find all right okay James sloths and what is the name Leo Leo SOS Lea iOS OS okay all right here we go a little jogging little exercise hello and welcome to a coding challenge the Chaos game okay this is exactly what I'm going to make in this coding challenge Thank You Prasanth Kumar for these super chat no more super chats please it rubs me hello and welcome to a coding challenge the Chaos game this is exactly what I'm going to make in this coding challenge why am I going to make it so recently I was very lucky to attend this amazing event called thinker con I'm wearing my tshirt from thinker con um thank you to the organisers of thinker con Destin Sandlin from smarter every day and Henry Reich and Emily graslie and Sabrina Cruz and Robert Cole rich this one event was mindblowing Lee awesome and amazing I met so many wonderful people links to finger con and various other YouTube channels related in the this video's description so while I was there I met for the first time in person a james schloss who is the author of the algorithm archive a wonderful website with many sorts of algorithms in it read more about it also from the YouTube channel that I have no idea how to pronounce still but only iOS OS and I've used a lot of his videos before as inspiration and ideas okay so James and I did a live coding demo in person at thinker Khan creating this the Chaos game so what is the Chaos game well the Chaos game the Chaos game I have to explain what it is now No that was that was pretty good that was pretty good cast game pretty good originally oh yeah then I have the numberphile video yeah the Chaos game is a silly wasn't gonna cry who's no crying encoding all right the Chaos game refers to a method of picking random points and iteratively moving point the previous point you picked to the next point in oh you know what there's not really a good way for me to explain it to you other than diagramming it and actually just writing the code for it for more background on the cast game I certainly would suggest this particular video from numberphile so what what what's amazing to me about the cast game is it's there's a very that's a very very simple idea so the way we're going to play the Chaos game is we are going to have a two dimensional space that two dimensional space is going to start with a set of seed points now I'm going to for the moment just create three sort of fixed seed points in the form of a triangle of course heading three points are basically gonna make a triangle let's roll on one line but that's another topic for another day and then what I'm going to do is I am just going to pick a random point anywhere that was such a fail third try is the charm third charms the third okay I got a random point and now I'm gonna start with this random point then if I were somebody who didn't code what I would have to this is the problem what I don't live stream often enough I have a lot of trouble I'm just gonna start what I want to do this with no edits whatsoever so you the viewing audience it's just gonna have to bear with me I promise that I am NOT going to stop again just needed a little warmup just needed to kind of get myself going for the day and now here we go this will all be over soon in more ways than one hello welcome to a coding challenge the trolls game so this is the Chaos game playing out right behind me um this is actually code that I wrote at this wonderful event that I recently got the chance to attend called thinker con thank you to the organisers of thicker con Destin Sandlin Henry Reich Emily graslie Sabrina Cruz and Robert Krulwich links to their information and websites in this video description this was like a mindblowing ly awesome event and while I was there I programmed in front of people underneath a rocket a Saturn rocket depicted here with James schloss now I never met James floss in person before but you might remember that I've used James floss is a YouTube channel as inspiration for other videos like the tesseract over here so James and I I think he used like Julia and like VI but I programmed this Chaos game algorithm in the P 5 web editor and that's exactly what I'm gonna do right now in homage to the wonderful time I had at thinker con so what is the cast game so first of all I would recommend this numberphile video about the Chaos game for background it is an iterative process of picking random points and and doing some math with those points and seeing what happens afterwards so rather than try to define it you can of course always read the Wikipedia page very tempted to do a dramatic reading of it I'm just going to describe to you how it works over here on the whiteboard so let's say we have a two dimensional plane this is a two dimensional plane and what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with a set of seed points so and maybe I'm going to put those points as an equilateral triangle but as you'll see eventually at some point I could have 4c points 5c points I could put them anywhere and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to play the Chaos game and the first thing I'm gonna do is pick a random point on the wall here we go first try earlier today earlier I was doing another take and I'd have to do that like six times I'm very lucky now okay so so this is my first random point now what I'm going to do is I need to pick a random number one two or three a B or C zero one or two how do I do that do I have a I don't know I'll just pick one from my my oh I have a book of random numbers five four one five seven so why don't we do seven modulus three right 7 divided by 3 is 2 remainder one so I picked a one zero one two so if this was zero this was one this was two what I'm going to do now is move half way to this point and now I have another point aha okay now pick another so there is number nine eight eight one eight so I just use the last digit 8 modulus 3 is 8 divided by 3 is 2 remainder 2 so 0 1 2 so now I'm going to go half way to this point and I could keep doing this over and over again and if you watch the numberphile video you'll see somebody do this actually physically with rulers and pens and all sorts of artistic talent I have none of those things so but I do know a little bit about programming and so this is something I can program so let's actually go program this and then see what happens all right so I'm going to use the p5 GS web editor this is I think a simple enough project I'm gonna go here I'm just going to go to the editor home page here and I'm going to this chaos Game one safe all right so let's start this off so I've got my two dimensional canvas what I need first are those seed points so I'm going to do this in a very simple way and then all right thank you by the way to Espinosa and dr. serpent on Twitter who created the our factor this later song which is like my new favorite world links to more about essence music in this video's description okay so I'm creating these three points you know you don't you know what I'm gonna put them in a random spot I'm gonna make the seed points themselves actually random why not right so I'm gonna have it at point a point B and a point C so I need three points ax am i standing in front of the code a kind of M so let me move this over and let me move this over let me give myself let me just use a window width and window height so I cover the whole thing and then I'm gonna make it a black background we're good alright so what I want to do now is let me draw those points so I'm going to say stroke 255 stroke weight eight so I just want to see those points a X I just want to see them so we should see three points now how come I don't see any points ah because I am drawing the background over and over and draw so let's do this here okay so every time I run this sketch I am going to now have three new points alright so now let's play the chaos game so what I am then I need a kind of global X Y we need a global X Y and what I'm going to do with that is I am also going to have X Y be some other random point and what I'm going to do in draw is say stroke let's make it like a nice RGB color and I'm going to draw a point at X Y and we can see okay there it is so this is right every time I run this I have my three seed points and I have this new pink dot which is the X Y so now what do I need to do what I need to do is I need to say let me pick one of those three points and move halfway there so the first thing I need to do here is just pick a random number one two or three right but this is going to give me a floatingpoint number so what I want to say now actually is give me floor that which will take off the decimal place and then if I get a zero I'm going to do one thing otherwise if I get a one I'm gonna do another thing and and I know I know there's all but just remember I know I'm overusing the sound effect right now but it's the first day I have to use it it makes me so happy so if I pick zero what I want to do is move half way I want to move half way right to this point guess what I could use some math right I could take the X of this the X of this / I've got a new X but there is actually a function in p5 called lerp lerp stands for linear interpolation meaning interpolate from one number to the other in a linear fashion by some amount so if I want to linearly but I want to linear interpolate if I want to learn from this point to this point by point five watch what I get to do fifty percent that's halfway there so I'm going to say x equals ler X ax 0.5 then I'm gonna do the same thing for Y and then I'm going to do here I'm gonna do it with BX look it's already happening the cast game is already happening over here look now I only have two points so you can see all the points end up just on that one line right every time I restart this all the points end up going between point a point zero and one but now let's make some magic happen whoops let's do the last possibility let's plug in the see and see what happens okay here we go what's going on do I see some pattern emerging here well I am playing the Chaos game this looks like it could be kind of familiar let's be a little bit more methodical about this let me actually start with an equal a perfect equilateral triangle I don't know what I mean by perfect but then what I'm going to do what do I need to do an equilateral triangle boy this is an equilateral triangle has an angle of 60 degrees so if I want to figure out from this top point how far down and how far over to go I just need to use the angle 60 degrees and cosine and sine I've probably got some video where I explain that right so I need to go you know what I should just do forget the equal I know I said I wasn't going to do any edits I feel like the equilateral triangle is a bit of a digression that I don't need to have in this of it well that's a nice one so let's let me go back so actually this won't be an equilateral triangle but it'll be simpler let me just put these seed points at the corners and then I so so I'm gonna put these seed points at the corners and then we're going to see what happens and then let's so we can start to see something emerging here this pattern that's emerging it's happening kind of slowly so what I might like to do a couple things I might like to do first of all I think it's I'm gonna make the points a little less thick then I'm also going to give them a little bit of alpha again I have no artistic talent so I shouldn't do what I'm doing and then I'm going to draw 100 of them each time through draw there we go there we go look what's happening so pretty so beautiful let's forget about the Alpha all right oh and you know we can do which is fun why not what happens if I give it different colors like here if I pick zero let's try this one color if I pick one let's try a different color and we can sort it and we can see now we can see there are actually three different sections in a way of this what is it called say it with me sierpinski triangle so this is what's amazing the chaos game this very simple algorithm will produce a perfect rendering of a fractal pattern this one very famously is known as the sierpinski triangle very little code I've got the sierpinski triangle right there so this coding challenge is actually complete but it's not over I mean the video is gonna end at some point when I stop rambling but let's think about some things that we could do for example anytime you make something like this you might think to yourself what are some parameters that I could start tweaking well why should I bother why should I start with only three seed points why should I only have why should I only go 50% of the way each time there why should I have an equal probability of going to each one aren't there some other things we could apply to this so this is now your exercise create your own version of this could you make an array of seed points could you vary the distance the the the percentage did a distance you go to each point could you vary the probabilities of how you pick each point what else could you do with color how could you render this could you connect the lines could you use different shapes what if you did this without and you had to erase the background so you're actually like piling up all the points in this big array there's so many possibilities I'm gonna come back in the second part and at least do the part I'm gonna refactor this later but not too much later where I'm gonna at least make this an array of seed points and and play around with that 50% value so I'm gonna do that much don't watch that video yet if it exists if it doesn't exist who can't watch it try this on your own and then share with me your results and then you'll see my extra little step with this and that'll be that okay if you're looking for the code by the way when especially when I do something in the p5 web editor you can just go to this particular URL which will also be in the video's description and I do have a page about this challenge also on the coding range okay thanks and see you the next time all right okay whoohoo all right so that was number one I'm just gonna move right on dr. circuit all right all right so let me do duplicate ooh I like this that's crazy okay all right hello and welcome to coding challenge the Chaos game pop dude electric boogaloo thank you Espen Larsen dr. circuit on Twitter for creating the I will refractor this later song this coding challenge is in honor of that song because guess what later is now I will refactor this now so what I'm gonna do in this coding challenge is expand this idea of the Kaos game instead of merely creating the sierpinski triangle I'm going to make a version of this where there could be more than three points seed points and that as the points move as the newly random point move moves from point to point to point I I might move by a different percentage than 50% so if you didn't watch the previous coding challenge where I made this you could pause now and go watch that or you could just stay here with me right now let's be together let's be friends on the Internet programming stuff okay so the first thing that I want to do to refactor this again but I'm not gonna overdo it use it sparingly otherwise people will get irritated and annoyed and I'm sure I will hear about it um the first thing I want to do is I am going to make a array called seed maybe I should call it seed points let's just call it points I don't know let's call it points and instead of having a X a Y what I'm going to do in this array let's get rid of this first I just want to recreate this exactly I am going to say I'm gonna have three points and I'm gonna create a new point which is a vector I'm going to use vector create vector function to make a new point anywhere randomly in the canvas I know I've run a little bit out of space here but that's fine and then I'm gonna say points push V okay and then I am going to have a point called current which is also going to be a vector a random vector I'm good there we go there we go so now what I can do is again I have just refactored this two instead of having separate XY variables for all four points I have an array that keeps my three seed points and I have my current point in and all current point is a separate variable and both of those are p5 vectors a vector being an object that can hold an X Y and a Z but I'm not gonna use the Z right now although you should do this in 3d but I'm not going to all right so then I'm going to say for let P of points and I'm gonna say a point P X P dot Y so we should see there we go those are my first three seed points and then what I'm going to do here is random the length and this is actually now oh you know what I don't even need to do this guess what the random function in p5 I'm gonna say like next equal to random function and p5 will give me a random object out of that array now if I want to pick them with a different probability I'd have to do something different but here this next is now going to be one of those three points randomly and then all I need to do is say stroke I'm gonna still give it this color and then I'm gonna say next dot x equals alert this so I'm LARPing but I'm gonna lurk between next and and the current oh and current is the result of that so the current is the thing that's moving and it really doesn't matter but I like to think of it in this order current is moving and then I think there's a lack sealer vector function so I could do this in one line of code that's another reactor this later now so there we go and then all I need to do is draw the point let's give all I need to do is draw that point and here we go look at this tada now one thing I should probably do is also reset it let's write it let's actually all this stuff here is kind of the process of let's write a function of resetting like I want right now it's like resetting every time I change the code because the p5 editors can figure to like relaunch the sketch but I think what I would prefer to do here is write my own function called reset it's a nice refactoring and I need to empty the array and I'm going to say points equals here so this function reset will just sort of reseed the environments and I could do something I could do it whenever I click the mouse but just for right now I can say if frame count modulus like 100 equals zero then reset so what that's gonna do is every 100 frames right because a modulus of the number 100 will equal zero anytime then frame count is divisible by 100 with a remainder of zero so you can see over and over again this is gonna so no I'm here I have refactored this but now that I have refactored this okay so for example I can just do this no oh yeah look now interestingly enough I don't really get a pattern that's super interesting to look at with four points kind of accidentally I sometimes M and so what happens if I have eight points whoa this is crazy now probably what I would want to do what might make sense for me to do is place these points around a circle just I mean it's interesting to have them randomly but I think I would prefer just in sort of figuring out what I want to do with this to have all those points around a circle right so you can think about actually this was a way of getting my equal triangle that I was looking for so what if I have eight points and then I get some kind of like hexagon octagon septagon whatever the number of sides is based on the number of points for three points it's a triangle so you can you could sort of do the math there of what's gonna be if I increase the number of points so let's actually not reset them randomly but let's reset them and in that sense I don't need to this can actually just be in setup and always keep these same seed points and what I'm going to do is say I'm gonna have an angle which is going to equal to pi divided by eight so let's make a I'm gonna use Const for a constant just to be have fun I'm gonna call that n oh oh I didn't did I not switch back all right don't worry everybody I have figured it out camera camera camera I know so hold on I'm gonna go back alright alright here we go alright alright so what I'm gonna do here actually is uh I'm gonna have a fixed set of points right so the points are I'm just gonna do once in setup and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use the constant Const N equals 8 and I know I could be using constant other places the code if you want to know more about Const I made a video about it where I got a bunch of things wrong five different resource for that but so I just now I'm making n points and what I'm going to do is say the angle is two pi divided by I that's a bad idea because I don't want to divide by zero so all right well we'll say oh it's I know what it is it's I times two pi divided by n that's what it is right because I want to have I'm looking for and if look if n is four for example I want zero degrees 90 degrees 180 degrees 270 degrees it's probably gonna go the other way because the screen is flipped but that's the idea so now what I'm going to do is say create vector at some number like let's just do 200 times cosine of the angle oh you know what I think there's P 5 vector from P 5 dot vector from angle I think as a function hangul so that's gonna make a vector from that angle and then I can say V dot V V dot multiply 100 and that's working but I need to translate to width / 2 height divided by 2 and now we have these points in the center of course I also if I want to I need to do that here okay so there we go we can see now I've created eight points around and let's actually use let's make that a little why is this down here oh oh there's a weird mistake goofy mistake happening Oh cuz when I reset this is this is kind of you know what I'm gonna do the translate is fine but it's bothering me I'm just gonna make life easier on myself and say add width / 2 height / right I'm just gonna move that to the center manually by adding that to the vector okay now what I want to do is multiply it by like width / 2 or something okay great so now you see those are all my points we're still playing the Kaos game now what I want to do is I am going to have a variable called percent and I also I just want to make like a lot more points really quickly so I can just sort of see the pattern and what I'm gonna do now is I am going to try I'm going to when I lurk I'm going to lurk by that percent and let's try different values so let's try so let's go back to 0.5 and this is what I get let's try 0.25 interesting let's try point 1 let's try and end of for 0.25 6 do I need like we could something more interesting I just could have sworn when I thought about this earlier I'd get more interesting patterns timeout for a second all right let me think about this could've sworn when I was looking at this page here inside a pentagon oh but the current cannot be the same let's try Pentagon they're up I just should have picked five [Laughter] alright I'm back Neko monsoon in the chat said try three just to see if you didn't break anything so I made the point N equals I made n equal three with the percentage of point five and we can see I have the sierpinski triangle actually if you look on the Wikipedia page for Kaos game you'll start to see a bunch of these a point inside a square repeatedly jumps half the distance towards a randomly chosen vertex but the currently chosen vertex cannot be two places away from the previously chosen vertex so this is interesting right so I could actually start to create some of these patterns by modifying how I pick a particular point so this one actually would be nice let's do the Pentagon one a point inside a Pentagon repeatly jumps half of the distance but the current chosen vertex cannot be the same this is going to be an easy one for us to implement we just need to get a new random number that's not the same as the previous one so so let's go back here let's first make this five okay so we can see even with five a Pentagon we're kind of getting a somewhat of an interesting pattern here and I might I don't know why I obsess over this sort of stuff but I kind of feel like let's give this just like a little bit of alpha and make the stroke weight one and do like a thousand points all right so we could just sort of see this pattern more quickly okay now what was I doing so what I want to do now is not allow the next point to be the same as what was previously chosen and so there's a variety of ways I could do this but actually I could just create a way of I could just create a way of ignoring it if it happens to be the same one so let's say previous I'm gonna create a variable called previous and right here when I pick previous equals next and I'm gonna say as long as next is not equal to previous then I can do this stuff so now look at this there we go the Chaos game Pentagon with one slight modification and you know what I I don't want it to keep resetting I just want it to I want to tell it not to reset and I want to go to share full screen and I'm gonna put this in a different window and we're gonna bring this up here and we're just going to enjoy this now okay here we go we're done chaos game thank you very much look at this it's so beautiful intricate and amazing so I now encourage you now you have really got something right you can start to make a variety of patterns and here's the thing one thing that you could do that actually is really it you could think about that I didn't do if we go up here look at this this is actually a little sort of animated gif showing you the process of actually moving the points from one spot to another and then sort of branching out so imagine what you could do if instead of just picking all the points and layering them you actually created a system or you animate the process of building this pattern and you can see you can see maybe you can recreate some of these other patterns by doing this rules this one would be a nice one to create you could try different percentages and see what you make so thank you for watching this second part of the chaos game I think we are done with all the cast games stuff I'm going to do if you make your own version of this please visit the coding train comm link that's in this video's description there there are instructions for how to submit a leg to the version of the cast game that you made yourself you can share with me your images or gifts on twitter at Schiffman or at the coding train hashtag coding chaos game and I'll see you in a future Kotick jaunt all right I don't know maybe I will all right everyone I think we got a couple coding challenges out of that I got my equilateral triangle in the end at least yes I did I'm just curious here I sort of thought varying the percentage would be interesting but apparently not so much ooh that's kind of cool so I guess it is maybe the idea was Oh going the hole going further is what I should have done right right it's all about going further uh okay hold on I got to come back we got to include this I don't need a record scratch sound effect I guess this could be done in post that's just not gonna want to add it I mean for a good reason I don't think we should do a record scratch wait wait wait wait wait let's refactor this now and actually I'm not actually gonna refactor it I realized something when I was playing with the percentage earlier and making it lower I started to get much noisier images and of course this is true because I'm not going very far and so the points are sort of layering on top of each other and I'm just getting kind of a cloud of points but what if instead of going halfway there and that's actually I don't I know I'm being kind of a lunatic about this stuff let me just make these white instead of going halfway there what if I go 75% of the way there so actually going further will start to yield some interesting patterns and you can see here now if I say 15 look at this so this is now fifteen points going 75 percent of the way there you know and by the way maybe if I were to make oh and that's 90 percent of the way there if I were to make some sort of slider where I vary the number of points I could go back to putting these points all in a random location that would be kind of interesting let's do that now just curious so where where do I let's do this let's just really quickly I'm just curious to see I got a stop you should I shouldn't be doing this you should be doing this right so you could see okay I don't know that got it so anyway so that's this is a clue to you of what you could now make right that I told you to share with me right you could vary that percentage vary the number of points vary where the seed point starts animate oh so many possibilities okay see you later good bye okay let me put this back however to five and and back 2.5 and there we go and there we go X Nick is asking what if your percent gets larger than one that's an interesting question oh yeah what time is it 1130 Akari oh part 3 says LOM probably not but I'm I'm about ready to go I have to just check something here just checking sorry I like to look at my email okay all right I don't see the demon faces we'd have to stare at this more later okay close these things out so I wanted to also I wanted to let me sign in here oh thank you to oliver harris a new member of the coding train authentication code all right I'm pretty sure now that's so all right so you might recall that somewhat recently I created the quickdraw a quickdraw coding challenge right here where I I use the quickdraw data set the Google quickdraw data set to replay drawings that people all around the world have made various things like cats and rainbows and so on and so forth so to do this I downloaded very large data files full of JSON data of all of the drawing information and then I spun up a little note server to pass individual drawings to a JavaScript web client and so now you know timing wise it's sort of ironically as soon as I did that almost like to the day the Google really creative lab released an api to it called a web component so I wanted to explore this in kind of like a part two the question is do I need to sign up for an API key so no no not quickdraw data set I'm already there a quickdraw component sorry this is what I'm looking for so I do need an API key okay so how do I get an API key I don't want to do it with NPM install join the quickdraw API Google Group API services library okay so let me okay let's do this whoa MoMA this seems weird doesn't make any sense I think that's a mistake on there is it like console google.com or something yeah maybe it's here api's and services the library quick draw quick know does anybody know what I'm looking for here this is API slash library this is so weird no quick draw API there's a quick web demo this is so weird why is it taking me to Pantheon Corp I mean this does not feel like where I should be logging in does anybody discovered where do I really need to search is it is it really as simple as reading the instructions and actually searching for this more precisely okay let's try this No consult developers.google.com let's try that that's where I want to try this yeah this is what I'm looking for hmm cloud google.com well I might have to come back to this the API is just not public yet oh but it's right here this is not a private component all right well maybe I'll use this API key of selfhosting huh quick draw files Oh appspot look at this like for example let's see this Drock component rjs oh the readme says to join the group which says they'll give you access to the API alright so I'm gonna come back I think I'm gonna I'm gonna join that group and come back next time and look at that API thank you which is good because I kind of have to go anyway I wanted to do this sort of thing cork on thing Google Creative Lab is and I don't know what what count Chris is asking is Google Creative Lab an official Google github account oh do I just have to literally join the group ok let's do that I just kind of would prefer to join it from so let me get an API key different a slightly different way for a second because I'd rather actually whoops or actually you know what this is fine all right let's all right let's let's all right let's do this let's join group okay so you can now see and enable the quickdraw API in your own project at Google cloud really it's so weird why is it still MoMA inside Google maybe that's really where I'm supposed to be going but there it is private create quickdraw coding train okay okay what API is do I have I should probably actually show how to do this in the video enable okay okay can I delete this library Oh Google Oh Google why why do you do this to me how do I delete it and I want a new project delete ah so delete this oh come on delete yes okay okay I don't think anyone watching the video is gonna be able to follow this and then I should be able to do me I am so me if you're actually watching I should be able to just do a once I have the API key I should just be able to do make a call to quick draw files appspot.com with with with just a get request right to get just like the JSON back like what I want to do is just get the data like I want to draw it myself fetch image data draw image now oh yeah like this drawing API middle one this is what I want to do so category ID equals or random API key format JSON okay great so this is this is what I need okay all right okay okay so now and okay okay all right everybody so give me a second here remind me later okay oops Oh I definitely need to go eat only new tasks I open up go into Chrome where there I should probably not do this now oh boy oh I just want to get this open I here we go I know the camera went out okay okay everybody I should definitely go eat lunch but said I was going to do this so dude you hear that that was my stomach growling I don't know if that came in through the microphone or not I don't think I need the thinker Khan shirt anymore I was wearing that for so let me this will work better for the microphone I'm sorry this is gonna make some weird sound for a second apologies for all the scratchy scratchy okay all right oh that mean okay well the problem if I go and have lunch which I should do I won't be coming back so I'm not doing this now or not probably should practice this first yeah okay and here we go all right here we go hello welcome to a followup coding challenge quick draw again thingamabob quick draw API web component addition so previously in a coding challenge I downloaded a large data file from the Google quickdraw dataset I talked about what the Google quickdraw dataset is it's just a collection of millions and millions of these doodles that people made playing the Google quickdraw game and I created a node server locally on my computer to open that very large data file and pass information about the drawings to a JavaScript program that would read that information and then replay the drawings in a canvas basically almost to the day that I released that coding challenge Google came out with something new called the quickdraw component and what the quickdraw web component is it allows you to actually using markup and importing a JavaScript file just actually embed quickdraw doodles in a web page I'm not going to do that in this video what I'm gonna do is actually show you how to use the API directly to pull the data from the drawing yourself so that you can draw it in a canvas so I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do just to be clear I know that wasn't clear at all I'm gonna do exactly what I did in the previous coding challenge but instead of downloading a very large data file and spinning up my own node server I'm just gonna ask the Google API itself for a drawing and then I'm gonna go eat lunch we should probably eat lunch now well maybe I maybe like pizza or something I don't not a big pizza eater but we'll pick some food themed drawing and just to be sure that I it's actually working to do it this way I am going to do this in the p5 web editor so that I can be sure that you could be sure that I'm not like secretly downloading a big file running a node server somewhere why would I do that though captain disillusion will come for me if I cry to fake something on my channel I was hoping that maybe it something in post just got added there got doubt it like a rainbow okay uhhuh so here's the thing it's a bit confusing because this is so new this API is available it's out there but it's a bit confusing to use it so the first thing you're going to want to do is go to this github repository quick draw component and then down here somewhere in here you're going to want to find this join the quick draw API Google group now by the time you're watching this this may have changed but I will hopefully keep the code uptodate but maybe the signup process will have changed so as soon as you go to the Google quick draw API Google Group I joined I'll end up this page click join you'll need some sort of Google account then you're gonna want to go to your Google API dashboard so here I am I'm at console developers.google.com slash API slash dashboard there are a lot of API is there that you could look at and what I'm gonna do is now search for quickdraw I made a project by accident which I didn't mean to but this is what I'm looking for quickdraw exclamation point data API private now this will not appear for you to you unless you join that Google group so that's a little bit of the confusing thing at least at the time that I'm doing this today November something 2018 it's like the 25th 26 something like that all right so I'm gonna click here oh and I need to make a project so I'm gonna call this project so I want to first create a project just try to click enable I'm gonna do this call this coding train test I'm gonna hit create and then I'm gonna go back and search again for quickdraw quick comma draw and I'm gonna grab this here no okay it's so hard to use these API services I'm gonna get this quickdraw API this is where I am select a project okay no I created a project oh oh here we are somehow I made it to the coding train test project you want to create a project and get to your coding train you're well you're not gonna call it Cody right get to your project page now I'm going to find that API it takes a minute for the project to it should actually be created I think I was going too quickly there I'm gonna go to quick draw data API ah there we go now I'm on this page now I'm gonna click enable and I'm in able ngey API okay so now I have this API enable the next thing that I want to do is go here under credentials because I'm going to need an API key so I'm gonna go here under credentials create credential yeah this looks good what API are using that's what I'm using look here's my API key fantastic so here's the thing I am going to regenerate this API key as soon as I finish this video so you won't be able to use it you'll have to create your own and I'm going to copy it copy it and I'm going to very quickly just over here now in my code I'm just going to add it at the top as a comment so I always remember it okay so here's the thing I should mention that this while you can do you can use the API I'm gonna do that right now if you're going to use this for a large project you might want to actually consider self hosting the API which is kind of what I did in the previous video but actually using Google's code which is probably much more robust and it's a lot more possibilities but once I have my API key all I need to do and I'm gonna scroll down here to API middle where I just need to go to this particular URL so let's grab this URL I am going to I'm gonna use the load JSON function in p5 I'm gonna paste this in here so now what I want to do is I want to say drawing category I know that cat is a category I'm gonna say ID so I could ask for a very specific drawing but I think I can actually just say random to get a random one and then get my API key and then I mean I don't is animated I don't want it animated and format equals I want it JSON like I want to get that JSON so let's see if I take this URL now not found all right what do we think I did wrong pause for a second hear me I am so me how did you get your successful get request he looking over there animated what if I don't give it an ID ah okay oh oh look at that interesting okay great oh hello I'm alright I'm back so interestingly enough even though the documentation says ID required ID number or random I thought this mint means I can actually type random into the URL query string but maybe not because now if I go back here and I just zoom in up here and get rid of ID equals random just start with key I can see there we go each time I do this I'm going to get a random cat drawing here in JSON so look at this lovely alright so great we're now using this API so I can go back here I can go back to my code and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say a constant URL equals so I'm just gonna save this and obviously I would want to do something more I could do so much hereby I could actually form the URL with the particular category but cat aghori but right now I am just going to keep that and I'm gonna in setup I'm gonna say load JSON URL got I'm gonna give it a callback got cat and I'm gonna write this got cat function drawing and I'm just going to say console dot log drawing so let's see that in p5 if I actually and I'm going to take we get rid of the draw function if I've actually got there we go drawing so this looks like there it is so you can see down here in the console all that data came in so all that data came in so I've got the cat and now guess what I can draw it okay so let's just make this 255 255 so oh I wonder if this is the simplified data so it actually probably isn't to simplify data or maybe it is I'm gonna be fine lots of github issues timeout for a second I like that solar liner wrote Dan is a dad confirmed I know exactly what solar liner is referring to do we know is this the simplified data will return raw timebased data Oh otherwise simplified data good where was I so looking back at the documentation I just realized is Anna made is animated if I set that to true I will get the data back that actually has the timing information related to how the user drew the drawing in down to the millisecond but which in my previous coding challenge I didn't bother to use I just use this simplified data which is just the x and y values of the particular path that the user that the user drew and it also is reduced normalized to 255 by 255 pixels square so I want to use the simplified data just to make my life easier because as I mentioned I need to go get something to eat is Pizza one of the categories it's the only food one that I could think of you know that's like you know vegan quinoa Bowl or something is one of the categories let's try pizza yeah looks like pizza came in or something so now what I'm going to do here is in got cat I'm now gonna call it got pizza got pizza what I'm going to do I really I could just go to my previous code do I dare I couldn't we actually probably rewrite this code it's a lunchtime you go up the other video I'll link to the time in the video or actually write this portion right now I'm gonna go to github.com slash coding train website and I'm gonna go to coding challenges all the way down to quick reading challenge 122 quick draw sketch is and this is the code right here where I in draw where I draw that particular pattern let's look at this basically actually here's the thing this whole thing there's no reason for me to rewrite this just to prove that this works this is the entire code and I am going to go back to my code I'm going to paste my entire thing in here the only thing I'm going to change is instead of my own node server / cat I am going to go to the particular URL now there might be some slight differences here but let's see what happens I don't see a cat let's try that again blocked by Coors I don't have the chorus problem before also that Kors arrow should have coming up in Oh guess what everybody oops hold on guess what everybody so before I had made it actually was the error that yes reload the site so Mattoon when we edit this like I don't need to go and find that Coors thing because that was a red herring I don't know why I got that error but this is the problem Oh guess what I found the problem when I made my own node server I sent the data back for the drawing in a drawing property of the data boy that was a terrible way to explain it I wrote my own node server so I had the actual data for the sketch the drawing the doodle embedded inside of the data coming back dot drawing but that's not the case with the Google API the cat or the pizza is just the data itself so if I now do this and now hit run come on pizza huh it's a good that's a very long timpani effect oh it just didn't work for the first one why is that it needs like a minute so weird what is going on I'm getting it sometimes and not other times so weird I'm getting the Coors error look I'm getting it in various places I think I think this is a weird p5 web Google API is also dot drawing seriously so that wasn't the problem oh it is not drawing I'm just a lunatic all right that that never mind Matt's yeah it is the cores issue but it was like I got it in my you know i refresh the page hold on a sec we get really autorefresh oh do you think it like I think this is there's some weird stuff with the web editor which is really unfortunate oops Oh No alright alright that's promising it's not the web editor you know just oh I'm over my API limits oh that's the problem okay probably because I was requesting it so often war I know it's hold on where where where is my console there we go okay can I do you think somebody used my key crazily yes somehow I think I've been foiled by somebody watching me cuz there's no way I made seventeen thousand eight hundred ninety nine yeah look at this watch here's the problem yeah this is the problem all right I'm gonna have to kill my key regenerate something and not make it public while I'm livestreaming why why can't we can't this is why we can't have nice things people I might actually just have to leave and come back and do this another time unfortunately or actually uh me I am so me could I perhaps use your key I promise can I use your key can you generate me a key and what I'll do is I'll put it in the code without I mean I maybe I can just generate my own new key I could have also like locked it to my IP address or something but okay thank you so I'm getting a new key and I will make my screen invisible when I get it okay I've got the key let me just get put it in a way that I can transfer it really quickly oh are you kidding me oh I have to like to factor again oh wait hold on don't worry everybody this will be ready in a second yeah I'll make a new sketch I don't know what a minute I I've got a way around this I will secret okay create secret just okay all right scream going away so what I'm doing now is I'm getting that key you can't see what I'm doing I'm getting this key getting messages Here I am going to I am going to put the key in the code you won't be able to see that and then what I'm going to do oh shoot ah hold on everybody hopefully I didn't mess up shoot I might have messed up I won't say what I did that I might have messed up though heíd address bar do I hide the address bar in Chrome how do I hide the address bar in chrome I'll be back here how do I hide the address bar in chrome f11 nope that didn't work that's probably like a PC thing make sure this actually works I don't want to go into fullscreen because oh woops sorry as soon as I get this to work and I will come back live there we go okay so I have it working oh that's all I need to do is hide the address bar there's got to be it go to about flags and the compact Flags compact address address book settings compact the address seriously won't i can't hide the address bar I have an idea actually all right fine okay alright I'm not going I'm just gonna delete the URL from the address bar use tape to hide it okay this is a working version I deleted the URL from the address bar cannot know where this oh you know there's oh my goodness there's an easy way to follow oh it's a way to find this ah you know what deleting the address bar is is no good because but anyway I just got a move on to finish this before somebody gets it because it's way too easy to get it okay I just realized okay okay I'm back actually so the problem that I was having was not a cores error or some other error there was no error the problem was the people of the internet that's why we can't have nice things somebody used my took my API key and started using it and I exceeded my quota so I have a new API key and I'm going to you can't sorry just run it quickly oh wait hold on we could do it quickly hi I'm back and I'm moving very quickly because the reason it wasn't working look at my code wasn't some mistake I made wasn't the dreaded cours error it was that I exceeded my quota now how could I possibly have exceeded my quota because I certainly did not make something like 19,000 API requests in the last few minutes and in fact somebody watching this this is why we can't have nice things people must have taken the API key so I have a different API key and because I've talked with you long it probably also just got used but let's hope it's here in this sketch I'm gonna run it for 29 err so let me show you what the error is I thought this was a cours error but it's actually the server responded with the error for 29 and for 29 is a issue with the key so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna conquer this I'm going away I'm gonna generate a new key and then I'm going to immediately run it for the first time live before anybody can possibly get it okay can I the question is can i generate a new key myself that's valid okay I know how to do this goodbye screen this is so sad I'm not gonna be able to have luxury of this I just want you to know whoever you are on the Internet this is definitely one that I should not have done live I guess no this is the old key whatever you saw was the old key so whatever you saw was the old key okay hold on I am going to sign up at mentioned me in slack if somebody has a key faster than I can make another one for myself so whack a no one managed to copy the key from the screen but there's a way to pull up the sketch that I'm writing in the web editor if I was not using the web editor nobody be able to get the key I should just not use the web editor you know what I'm just going to not use the web editor next time but let me just get another key join group I'm joining from my real Google account and then console dot developers.google.com password feels best plan I know okay that just seems like all this extra programming I guess I should do that it's gonna go here and moderate the chat also while I'm here okay oops I'm determined to do this quick sorry me I am Sammy creating a credential okay I have another API key we have another API key thinking here let me get my API key okay have my new API key let's make sure this actually works okay I'm getting drawings now what's gonna autosave shoot you're right about the password field two lines of code what's two lines of code the password field it feels like a lot more than okay I'm gonna do it okay I am going to okay all right don't worry this is not the actual key all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put this at the end and key equals then I am going to here how am I doing this I'm creating like a create input how do I make something a password field how do i password field password input field how do I do that in HTML input type equals password okay type password know type password oh oh man sir yes okay okay all right great okay and then Plus API key key key input let's call this key input key input equals API key sorry I'm thinking I really need to go eat key no API key all right all right all right I'm gonna do this as part of the coding challenge even though it's irrelevant but you've who hints equals API key I like that all right oh but I just gonna move quickly all right all right I'm gonna I'm gonna conquer you Internet what I'm gonna do here thank you to me I am so me for this suggestion all right I'm gonna conquer you Internet thank you to me I am sue me for this suggestion what I'm gonna do I've already started doing this I'm gonna create an input field key input I'm gonna say key input equals equals create input with nothing in it so oh let me know do I put Auto refresh here oh and let me uncomment this out okay so now we should see there's this input field right so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna say key input dot attribute this is all the p5 Dom library type is a password so what this means is anything that I type in here you can't see and then when I call new cat I'm actually going to say I'm gonna get the API key is key input dot value so I'm gonna get the input from the value it's not speaking anymore I'm going to yes I'm gonna get the API key from there and then I'm going to with what I did to this URL is I just left it with key equals blank at the end so now I am going to say plus API key so if the API key is in here if the API key is in here then what will happen is it will pull it from there you won't be able to see it it will pass it to that you won't need to do this you don't need to be crazy I'm just here trying to defeat the internet and unfortunately I might have made a mistake but hold on so I'm gonna get rid of this screen behind me I'm gonna go get my API key I'm gonna put it in my clipboard I'm gonna put this back and gonna paste it in Oh syntax error syntax error what's going on oh I'm not calling you cat I forgot I had new cat commented out because I was so worried mmm hold on hold on I guess the sequence doesn't matter here play No what is going on but wait why do I have this error now it's really 1240 this is what always happens to me cannot read property value of undefined sketch line 19 what what what is going on oh okay I didn't have okay new cat was commented out so I need to actually call new cat I also need to call new cat after I create that input field okay I'm gonna defeat the Internet here here we go alright the input field is there I now will make this go away I am now quickly going to get my API key coming back here this is coming back and pasting it in here 401 that's good my sequence is off I guess I should make a button let's let's make a button yeah this is gonna be fun format yet alright new cat is commented out that was a problem I think what I can want to also do is create a button like start and then I'm going to say start start equals create button start equals create button start and then we say start mousepressed new cat so now okay now I should the sequence should be I'm gonna I'm gonna win the work I'm gonna paste my API key in there then I'm gonna click the start button then I should start seeing my cats and they won't be cats they'll be pizza because I'm gonna go eat lunch but prodigious a salad disappear captain disappear lusion rookie quick get my API key then paste this in here you can see it again now I'm gonna hit start thank you very much I can get another pizza there we go every time I press Start we'll get a pizza I win internet so you won't have to go and so defeat it nobody nobody won here basically we all lost so anyway you can see now there was a point to this the whole point to this was that the exact same code I wrote in the previous coding challenge I can now run from anywhere by using the official quickdraw API from Google I might have to just come back and do this video again but it's going to exist in some form because this was all too insane so yeah so goodbye everybody I am going to take this away so that nobody sees my key by accident and I will see you in a future challenge all right I got to go everybody that's it I don't know if I'm coming back on Friday now I should be right back on Friday I will be doing something on Friday I I would take questions and stuff but it is 1245 I'm probably like unbelievably late for something let me just check the calendar here to make sure okay I'm okay I have a little bit of time but I really have to go so so anyway so so yeah so thanks for watching thanks for tuning in this has been the coding train when I will just say I will take you out with thank you Espen
