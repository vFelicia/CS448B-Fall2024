welcome I don't know it's Halloween now give me a give me a break I was trying something welcome I hope you can hear me I hope you can see me am i streaming am I live I'm back into the coding train it's Friday it's October something Halloween's coming up in a few days I don't have a costume but although I am dressed as Daniel Shipman on the coding trade Friday afternoon is not the greatest time for me it's been a long week I'm very exhausted but I'm pulling the energy together looking over at my monitor here there's the Train Here I am and here we go all right welcome welcome so what's happening today what are you watching this is me Daniel Shipman live on Friday afternoon as I often M I'm gonna do some coding stuff I'm gonna be here for a couple hours like wake up somehow I did this whole workshop today actually I'm kind of excited to talk to you about this let me open up the web browser here well I'm gonna talk about processing day so many things uh let's see I know I know there's some of you out there who watch this because I've met some of you in person at processing day in Boston last week and that was really wonderful so hello to everyone that I met in person in Boston I'm going to what I have an idea whatever oh yeah I gotta put the the green paper over here I will do that in a moment whenever I'm lost and feeling like I don't know what to do on the coding train I think maybe it's just time for them some random comfort this will get us warmed up spooky random numbers sixtythree thousand and fifty eight six thousand four hundred and ninety eight forty nine thousand three hundred thirty nine 314 that's all I got for you okay who I do sort of have a costume this is my coding train conductor cap I could put that on I think somewhere over here I might even have a bandana if I walk over here in this pile I have like bandages and splints from having a broken arm but I can't seem to see where that that bandana is that's okay I do have some oh here we go some toy train this is Rosie and this is no this is not what Tomas trained all right Oh Adam asks when do you start programming probably let me see maybe like 45 minutes or so wait takes me a while to like drum up the courage oh I should really read at the same tempo of the music that would have been good alright let me um oh I have something I have something really spooky for you here for my spooky coding train episode I am the headless programmer whoa this isn't really working for the necklace the floating head let's see this is gonna go over here this is gonna go over here Jared in the chat is somebody that I met in person a processing day hello the tech block is here for their first stream ever are wonderful alright so I have a new system that I'm working on my new system is although it's a little silly for me to pull this up here if I go to YouTube Schiffman live this webpage will be here with that me on it I'm talking but what I want to look at is this so what I what I'm trying to do now is oh is always keep this is a description this page is always there it's just usually says offline but I'm when I think of something that I want to do a video on I put it in here even though I have this whole rainbow topics github repository that someday I'll figure out this magic way to organize and figure out what to do in each livestream as I look through that and think of things this is most of my running list of things that have come up in my courses here at NYU that I'm gonna do videos on I will also mmm those TBA so I didn't do a good job and that was last week Friday October 20th but the idea is that you can always check this page and I will keep it up to date with like when is the next livestream and what time and then if it's not up to date you can send me a tweet at Schiffman to say hey did you forget to update it and then I will go and update it so that's my new system oh I could ship dressed in green that would have been a good spooky I probably enough green paper that I could just tape it all to myself and some weird I don't know I'm not really that big on the Halloween thing although I was told by my children to dress as cyborg this year because I have all this metal and titanium in my arm so I'm already cyborg so maybe I have maybe a when is Halloween next week whenever it is okay so by the way this then we can see this is my running list of topics Oh somebody's really upset by this corner note this corner yeah that's a little better right there we go all right so functional pride no can you believe this can you believe it yeah six arrows Hey that's why it's spooky because the arrow function is your programming so let me get this list here all right stop talking you let me grab all this so unfortunately I can't do the Alexus skill today because I don't have the Alexa with me that's too bad and I have to come back to that next week I'm not really prepared for this stuff I'm not prepared for anything I feel like every week it's important this is kind of like eating my although I really like vegetables so I'm gonna say this but I kind of have this thing where I want to replace all of the old objectoriented programming in JavaScript videos with es6 classes and so just each week if I can do like one or two more of those that eventually they'll all be done and I will have released myself from that this is something that came up I sweet at ITP in my intro programming class we were looking at how to use the webcam in the browser with p5.js and I have all these in turn a lot of videos a slitscan example a photobooth example a weird like brightness and check box mirror I didn't think I did one that like paint your portrait with flocking agents or particles so I want to do that some of you might have watched the recent golden 11 video about circle morphing so I thought I should do a circle morphing coating challenge to help kind of kick that off and then this is I want to do I I'm working on a word to Veck you know you might be asking like what is word to vac but there's this thing that exists in data science maybe I don't want to feel this falls under machine learning data science computational linguistics of taking words in a body of text and encoding them into some sort of like magical it's not really magical numeric form so that you can start to like add and subtract and do all sorts of interesting things with words and I've been reading a tutorial from Allison Parrish which is amazing that I want to refer to and that's a tutorial in Python I want to reduce some of the examples in JavaScript with this word to Veck library so this is my list I think this might be a time for I don't have a sound effect for it strawpoll that does work it's my new ticktock sound effect oh I know night for a strawpoll so I think that might be how I sort of figure this out so I'm not going to include the more oo p in jf because i have to do that and i don't know if i'll start with that or come back to that later but the rest of this stuff let's let's I could also just spin the wheel but I like doing the straw poll thing sometimes I like to spin the wheel let's do this I'm gonna grab all this I'm gonna go to straw poll comm what should I start with can I just paste this in here no that would be much too easy so do these one at a time these go together by the way filters should probably be on this list right should I filter on this list whoops worked better alright so here we go this is now the straw poll that's the next was like so this is the straw poll somebody please who has privileges please post this in the chat I had this other oh yeah and I want to do I wouldn't do some work I need to tell me the contest where I can give them another tshirt cuz I'm kind of like really into this game show thing recently and I've been trying to find all this game show music behind this door is es6 arrow function look at just the cut off rather abruptly all right so maybe so people are watching this for the first time if you want to support the work that I'm doing I really don't recommend that you do that but if you really insist you can go to patreon.com/scishow of the coding train you can join our slack channel and then if I ever get around to it I will sometimes send you a tshirt or a book depending on the level of support that you provide let's see what else oh you can get your own coding train at Storenvy coding train comm probably the bit description this video um let's see what else can I tell you about me I will be here every Friday I'm excited about some new work that I'm doing in the area of machine learning which will be coming soon to a coding train near you and that okay so let's see well how's this going don't hide the shirt have I given you guys enough time let's see George is George writes could get you know I know this is a particularly late time so I have heard from a lot of people especially European and other international viewers that are either six hours ahead or twelve hours ahead it's made for you you like to watch it live and couldn't I do this at some sort of normal time of the day and I hear you and I will try to do it earlier on other weeks this is a particularly busy time of the year for me I am I teach three classes full time here at New York University and it's busy but it's gonna slow down and they don't be January and I will have all this time to try to through I might rethink my actual a live streaming scheduled for 2018 so stay tuned quorum in the Patriot group asks what about also Jay s call bind apply don't really like not have to use those anymore now that we're into es6 I thought maybe I just took so long to make videos about those it's kind of like how I kept saying I was gonna make a video about the Kinect skeleton Trek it took so long to get to it that Microsoft just ended up killing the Kinect and maybe I don't need to bother to do that video anymore I really think I should do it still I have one sitting over there I'm gonna next week next week let's do Kinect so hello Germany Oh merge in in the chat Merrigan I'm sorry I'm totally mispronouncing your name create it let me let me mention a few shout out things here creating an iOS app to do coding in p5 Simon also a loyal viewer Simon who stays up way past his bedtime to watch the coding train created a his his own p5 no I'm sorry his own speech library wanted me to mention it Simon so github.com slash Simon Tiger I think Simon Tiger and so if you're interested in check did a lot of videos on the p5 speech library and here if you want to check out Simon's library called speech j/s go check it out and see what you think and maybe add some comments and give some feedback ah also I am going to I am going to today I definitely won't do that circle morphing thing so let me let me bring that up for a second first of all let's go to Twitter oh it's gonna do something with the paperclip game so many things I can't do quit it quits it's too much circle move so a hashtag woah I spelled it wrong circle morphing on Twitter we should see now we should see now look at this so this is one of the things that I want to look at today how do you morph this is a lovely like sort of visual explanation from one shape to another goal unleavened did in a whole guests video about this there's a whole repository with lots of examples of this but I wanted to do as a challenge one of them so let's look at some of these whoa that's kind of nuts oh this one's cool I looked at it earlier which is circle to spear look there's me and it's somebody else's video this is Dave's video and look at this sphere can you hear by the way the audio coming from that you can't I have to switch it so you can hear the laptops audio and then I love this one but where well here it is here's a cool oh wow I haven't seen this one whoa wait a second what just happened there that was a circle and now it's a square wow that's wild this is what I was expecting whoa alright so all these wild ideas that I could have never thought of in my life of changing from square to circle a lot of them from Johann Carlson sees there's so many so let's encourage you to look at those on your own and I think I think I've I spent enough time stalling now that we can look at this I wanted to do the painting webcam challenge okay good that looks pretty good wow there's a lot of pretty wide riders up it's you know this thrills me to no end because while I'm excited to learn these new syntax features of a programming language and there's lots of value there and usefulness yeah is it really what I'm here for am I really here for the arrow function I don't have them I don't have any production it's just me it's like bad with something like app where you press buttons and play sounds it's terrible alright so let me just confirm cuz I have a bad habit of making a video tutorial if something I already made if it's real about so let me just confirm that I haven't actually made this video tutorial so where am I in the world I'm gonna go here Schiffman and I'm gonna go to here what I'm looking for is 11 video and pixels I'm okay so these are the ones that I've done brightness Mir already I thought I had it I thought oh I did it but it wasn't I let it look the other day it wasn't there let's watch this video maybe it's good oh Jesus we gotta watch an ad first what is this YouTube thing so I'm gonna take a break oh alright alright so I already made this go you can stop watch this live it go out this video alright so this is really to work this is terrible no no I don't know what would I think I have to do this again this is not a legitimate this is bad use of polling if anybody I don't know if anybody knows what I'm referring to there but that this is a bad use of polling we now have 23 people who didn't get a chance to vote over here so we're going to do this again without it what should I start with oh wait hold on so one thing we would the simplify things is I'm gonna say circle morphing I'm gonna say word to Veck I'm gonna by the way I'm just gonna here's the thing I have to do the circle morphing and I have to do the object stuff what's the point of this alright we're gonna do both of these things today it's it could not possibly have been a half an hour so sometimes certain things that I've made don't get noticed if they're not one of the coding challenges they're sort of buried in the tutorial playlist if I called it like coded challenge paint your portrait you know everybody would have known that know that it's there do it better says alka all right let's see here it's time first of all all right we're gonna do something totally crazy instead nothing that I said is what we're gonna do this is a terrible idea but I'm gonna go here this is the workshop that we did today and ITP up wrong wrong okay oh wait yep you have to be able to hear the sounds here so we got some instructions here make a project about shadows that prophesize prophesies with the word Nick API yeah that's Ben again make a project about the history of the bicycle that sings with pearly noise you can't even hear the music Brock you nuts I mean I'll come back to this hmm all right we're gonna do I have to do all these things today so the order is really just the only thing that I'm trying to figure out okay things that I must do today circle morphing object one more Opie in J s video that's really words avec I feel like these are the things that I have to do wait yes six air so here we go and processing dot PI that's an interesting idea well that's the other thing I've got here yes six may or should leave that out right now I already put that in there alright let's let's uh let's see what happens here let's okay here we go all right everybody this is for real whatever the wheel tells me is what I must do oh my god seriously oh no keep going keep going is it 430 yet it's at 430 all right enough enough with all this meshuggenah nonsense it's time let's do something for reals I don't know if I really want to start with this but the wheel has spoken and so I'm going to do a video about and I have a kind of a strange demonstration that I think might be somewhat useful so first what I need to do is open up terminal and let's see here it is a happy face where do I go desktop p5 G B I'm standing totally in front of what I'm typing oh I know what I needed to do a workflow video today I just need to I just need more time p5 G there is a lot arrow functions I know arrow functions ok but I'm not sure why I'm doing this but I am it's happening somehow for some reason and now I open up my text editor and think we're good okay oh all right yep Thank You Simon this is 16.3 arrow functions topics of JavaScript in es6 so I think this merits me starting over here and I don't know what's going on with this camera am I like unreasonably large let me see if I can zoom out a little bit more it's probably if i zoom out too much oops that's looming in also should check the focus here can you read that let me have a look that's the wrong button the button that I usually use to zoom in to check the focus doesn't seem to be working but I'm just gonna assume that it's fine I'm not gonna trip over my okay focus is good all right hello welcome to a special spooky coding train video about es6 the arrow function spooky arrow function hold on a sec recording this close to Halloween and when you're watching this in the future you won't care and that'll be ridiculous but that's what the video is starting with anyway what is this thing I have to say for a very long time I have seen this in code and I just kind of shrivel up and feel very worried because it's um we kind of don't understand and I think that I'm supposed to understand it and it's supposed to make things better but I just don't understand so I've taken some time to attempt to understand it I've used it and I'm intending to use it in some future videos that I'm going to make possibly even today so I feel it's time for me to attempt to talk about what this is to you the viewer the watching this video so there was a time in the past not too long ago when I made a video about yes 5 vs 6 kind of talked about what those things were I messed up a lot of it if you read the comments you could see what I messed up but there was an aspect of it where I discussed this idea of var being the way to declare a variable in the previous version of java script called es 5 and now there is another way to declare a variable let which is part of es6 and then there is even another way to declare a variable known as Const which is also part of es6 and keys work in a slightly different way and they clean up some problems and they protect you against yourself in your own inevitable ability to make all sorts of strange errors and so that's a separate discussion now there is another change that can be looked at somewhat in the same way which is that there I used to be able to say and I still can and I still will and I'll probably always will function don't go away from me I can declare a function like this with some amount of arguments there is a new way to do this exact same thing oh my goodness look I forgot to put a name I forgot to name this function and the reason why I forgot is because the thing that I'm talking about here with arrow functions that's what's gonna go over here this is yes five it's typically used I think actually it's the only way you could use it someone's gonna tell me that I'll correct myself later for anonymous functions anonymous functions unnamed functions inline functions will you'll see if that's not familiar to you I will explain that as well in the context of this video but what you can see here is I'm saying function with these arguments execute this code this function doesn't have a name it's not called unicorn fluffy x or whatever it's just called function so now instead I can say hey look at this these parentheses here I can say hey let's instead of saying functions function let's say arrow which is an equals and a greater than arrow curly bracket close curly bracket so this is somewhat yes five yes six now why why why would you want to do this I mean I'm just gonna I'm gonna stand to my back to you for a second and look at that you could see I could see if I have a slightly like growing bald spot over here now I'm looking at this tripping over things why would you do this well one thing is it's a little bit less typing function equal less than two characters it's eight characters that sits or save some typing ultimately that's what are the main reasons for the this arrow function which is so known as like lambda I think is a way of referring to it I should look up is to reduce the amount of code you have to type but there are also some things that this fixes that are weird about how this function can work related to scope and all this stuff I gotta take a break all right right right right right right you don't need to print yes yes you can call arrow functions lambda there unnamed functions that means I'm anonymous that the same thing okay no you can have one line I'm just checking I'm just checking the chat and everybody is like correcting me or actually no one's really corrected me there okay and so one of the reasons to write functions like this too for this arrow syntax is simply beach conciseness less typing don't need function we just say equals greater than the interesting thing is this one of the reasons for doing this is this idea of conciseness this can become even more concise in fact these parentheses were going to see as I show you some examples are optional and in fact not in some cases this bracket is also optional oh and uh totally writing somewhere you can't see but what I just wrote was optional and in fact let's say my function was gonna return something this return statement can in fact be optional or implicit it can be just sort of assumed that it's there that you're going to return something and eventually you can see that we might write things like this this is a function that takes any given value X and returns its value x 2 whereas previously I would have had to say function parentheses X and prejudices open curly bracket return X types to close curly bracket so on the one hand xiety of these lambdas these arrow functions we can start to do things that are very concise for these anonymous unnamed functions that's the same thing in certain scenarios I got to come up with some scenarios where it'll be useful but there's also something else and in fact it's something really interesting and confusing and weird which is that you know there's this keyword in JavaScript called this and it's a fundamental to a lot of how things work with objectoriented programming and classes it's context when you have a callback and you use this so there are some issues with the way that this function definition loses track of what this should be pointing to in certain cases where you would want it to be pointing to something and the arrow syntax fixes that so in the same way that let fix some problems with scope and how variables are defined the arrow syntax fixes some problems with how this operates in JavaScript and about what it points to so this is the map of some new features in es6 function becoming arrow leading towards interesting concise statements for various operations like perhaps some array operations that might show you with things like map or reduce or filter as well as this thing about fixing this this thing okay did you really just watch whatever hellovenus was about some spooky diagram of an arrow function you did so let's try to write some code and maybe it'll make more sense all right how am i doing it's off screen what's off screen play the Vista song need something that we can ping what did I what did I what I do hi oh this thing I wrote was like way too high I always do that it's like I can't not do it I gotta just good all right where was I I could watch myself back I could just redo that part zoom out you do the whole thing over all right we'll see if not you can save me for myself once again so for example we can eventually right I'm gonna give myself some more room here and not draw too high up there like I usually do but I might have just done and had to reach state what I'm saying we can eventually write things that look like this X arrow x times 2 what does this mean this means actually create a function that takes an argument X and returns x times 2 so one of the reasons for doing this this is Miss conciseness now ok so I just read that part did I talk about the this thing after that I think I might have let me do that part again yeah exactly they're spooky I'm not kidding about them being spooky it's like I don't I don't love the well ok so I don't remember what order I talked about anything and so one reason is a new syntax concise this common operations and actually one of the things I will show you is this this kind of writing can be really useful when I eventually make a video about some other array functions that I'm going to use for some other tutorials that I'm doing and if we look at the functions like map and reduce and filter these are array functions that you can perform operations like if I wanted to just double the element of every if I wanted to double the value of every element in an array I could say map and give it this and it's gonna just happen in a nice and concise way now there is another aspect of this that's key and someone crucial which is that there is a word a key word in JavaScript called this and we've seen familiar with it this is the word that I always forget especially when I'm doing objectoriented programming I need to save this dot X and this dot why I'm always forgetting but this dot this can refer to different things in fact if I'm just in a JavaScript sketch and the bet I've written a piece of code that's running in the browser if I just say this it refers to the window object sort of global object this always refers to something it's the current context of where you are I may in this object I mean in the global scope and with this particular function syntax you might want to use it in a particular context where you want to keep a certain value of this and not lose track of it and in fact this old this old way of defining a function can forget about what this should be referring to and this way of doing it is a way where where JavaScript will not forget and so in previous versions of JavaScript you might have seen things like bind and apply you can use other functions to kind of bind and keep track of the this and with the arrow function that this will keep track of itself in a more elegant and hopefully way that you would have intended so I really like out of context that probably makes absolutely no sense but I'm going to make a scenario in this video where I want this to equals thing and writing it this way it fails and writing it this way it works I will say I erased my bar becomes let bar becomes LED is pretty friendly uh they're both three letter words bar needs variable let just kind of like let this equal something this transition function means I'm defining a function era I guess we could make this sort of case that like these values these arguments become transformed or gets sent into here and do something X becomes x times two so there is some kind of meaning there but one one reason why I tend to avoid using arrow functions all the time is that it can make y can make your code fewer characters which sometimes is valuable for making it readable it can be really hard for beginners and we're just starting out to be able to read and understand what the code is doing so this video is to explore you but you can't escape it I might like to run away and never look at an arrow function but I can't escape it so this video is an attempt to unpack this even more alright let's let's actually look at some code alright let's see that was probably a ridiculous amount of time spent but let's all right if you're still watching this video you're a very nice person really appreciate it I have a p5 sketch it's doing nothing it's just a blank canvas I want to add something to it I am going to say let button equal create button press and then I'm going to say button dot mousepressed now whoops in an older life the goal in another time when I had less gray hair and was even a little bit more organized making these video tutorials to be perfectly honest I would have done something like this change background and then I would have written a function down here function change background and I would have said this function is a callback to the mousepressed event on the button so button dot mousepressed that change background function run whatever code is in here whenever you press the mouse on the button and let's actually do that I'm going to say background you know random 255 so now if I go back to the browser and look at this code every time I press the button I get a new random greyscale background this is my way of writing this code when I want to work in a sort of the most easytounderstand way in a beginner context very freely I have a function here I can see what its name is and see where it goes so one thing I could do in JavaScript which is isn't there's no reason why I have to name the function and then put it down here I could just take this whole function take this whole function and put it in between the parentheses and mousepressed so I'm gonna do that you just put it right there and I'm gonna just hit save it's gonna like Auto format it and now that it's in there it doesn't need a name it sort of exists just just for the event right here I'm gonna put a function in there past the function in as the argument itself you know which do I like better one or the other who really knows I don't know but this is an anonymous function it has no name you could call it an inline function although it happens over multiple lines so that's step number one now if I hit refresh same exact thing is happening I could now be even more concise and I could get rid of the word function and I can say equal arrow and there we go hooray I've used an arrow function hit refresh and it's the same thing and I can I don't even I don't know do I need these could I even get away with something weird like this maybe oh that looks so strange is that could that possibly be right somehow I just find this hard to believe that that could possibly be right Oh what did I do wrong here maybe this see this yes maybe here yeah let's try this this is what I don't like these arrow functions I could never figure it out but maybe you can't even do it this way because it's not put hold on look at this deformity in the chat telling me how to do this correctly I didn't like it in the first but I mean I well I guess I could put the brackets in like this oh that's wrong because there's another oh this needs a semicolon no yeah that's what I had one close parenthesis oh yeah oh oh missing a closed parenthesis here oh the random so wait a sec okay by the way this is definitely not all making it into the edited version people really like what I don't edit out my mistakes but some of the stakes have to be edited out I'm just monkeying around here so if I get rid of this and get rid of this in this case those brackets are not optional too much going on in there with the funk called a background alright so we'll just go back to here and it had whole digress it out of trying to get rid of the brackets there okay so here is step number one all right get rid of this summer is there really a way it's a really away alone all right let's give us a little bit more let's get a little more try what you're saying is okay so I definitely don't need this this is a full statement then I don't need this and I don't need this this should work right I did it all right so baby might cheer would you edit it leave like a little bit of me messing up and then cut to right now I guess okay I think I figured it out let's try this one more time what's optional oh yeah I could get rid of the curly brackets those are optional if I get rid of those curly brackets I also don't need this semicolon because it's one line and then I should be able to do this and now in theory this is also correct very spooky though and this works too here's it have I helped anybody have I made the world a better place yes I can just wreck that in one line but I can and I sort of guess I understand what's going on but in the end I'm very happy with it there we go I'm very happy with it like this this is perfectly fine I feel like I could breathe I can relax I can name everything in my code and I can know what it's doing but there are some cases where the arrow function really does help and I will get to those eventually in these incredibly longwinded video tutorials that I'm making let's look at one such case so let's say that I'm going to create a class and I'm gonna call this class counter so this is a somewhat of a trivial example that doesn't have a lot of practical value although I would I think that I could expand it to start using like Dom element animations or API calls so let's begin with something though that's very very simple the idea of this class whenever I make a class I need a constructor I'm going to make a variable I'm going to make one I'm really standing in front of my code I'm going to make a property called count and I'm going to set it equal to zero then I'm going to write a function called count it and I'm gonna say this count plus plus and I will just say oh yeah and let's do this let's also say this dot P equals create P so to make a paragraph element and then I'm gonna say this dot P dot html' this dot count what is going on my goodness so the idea here is that and I'm gonna get rid of all this stuff that I had from earlier in the video I'm gonna say no canvas and I'm gonna say let's counter 1 equal new counter and then I'm gonna say I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna do I'm gonna do I guess I'll use the draw you'll see I plan but for now I'm just gonna say function draw which is a little bit weird counter 1 dot count it okay ready so here we go what's gonna happen when I run this sketch it's gonna break because this needs to be a global variable and by the way this might be a time where I used Const I'm never going to read Eclair this object I don't know I'm just trying to use trying to get comfortable using Const when do I use Const if it's something that I want to not allow myself to reinitialize read Eclair in a different way and protecting myself from mistakes oh oh you've got to do it up there oh boy Wow it can't you can't of course I can't do that I can't make the constant nothing and then read it all right I'm just gonna be just let how's the big failure I have a new music oh yeah that was a big failure for using constant how's my new sound effect okay nevermind okay so let me just use let take it easy on me please I'm just gonna use that now let's run this and there it is look at that I've got my counter going like this here's the thing I didn't really want to use that draw loop I want each counter to count itself so what I want to do is when I make a counter I want to give it some things like I want to give it a starting value and I want to give it a wait a time so I'm gonna say what I want is this counter to start at 100 and I want it to count every 500 milliseconds so this dot count should start a start and I'm gonna have a new variable called this dot weight which will equal 500 now what am I gonna do I am going to use and I actually probably need to keep this dot wait we'll see in a second I could use this I'll call this wait you'll see in a second I'm going to use this function called set interval and what set interval does is it says here's a callback count it write that function down here and then do that every so often all right I ready so this is the idea I'm gonna create a counter and that is going to and then I'm going to say like every 500 milliseconds count up from 100 and update that paragraph element let's see what happens ah counted is not defined oh yeah counted is not defined it's looked down in the scope here oh okay well I know I know I know I'm gonna make this called a function count it so it's not really like a function that's part of the class anymore it's just like a function right so I'm gonna I'm gonna name it function and I'll I'll put it even here like this is how I did it with that Mouse pressed right count that function increase the count here we go here we go here we go no cannot read what oh it cannot do anything why why why so hold on a second let's just see something when I first run a sketch if I were to just do something like and say console dot log of this what I get is this thing called the window object this refers to the global context the window object now if I'm in here if I'm in the constructor for example and I say console dot log this oh I'm referring to the counter object because this JavaScript knows to repoint the keyword this to the current context which is the current counter object but why why why what is happening in here console dot log this this is inside the class it's a function inside the object can't I know that I'm talking about that object and so now I'm gonna refresh and see it's what is it console logging the window object again spookie window up now sounds good so so what do I do about this guess what this is where the arrow function comes in if I instead if I use an anonymous function right in here so I can take this whole thing and I can put it in here I can get rid of the name right so this is just me we creating this with an anonymous function I'm gonna hit refresh it's still referring to the window object because I've named this function but if I change this to the arrow syntax let's see what happens now there we go and now I have my counter that's working and here's the thing what's magical not really magical about this is that what I've done is because I made this objectoriented and actually to be honest this doesn't need to be this because again let's make them constant there so constant its I can't even bring into I can make a bunch of these starting at different values going in different with different speeds and we'll see here that there we go I've got a bunch of different counters each counting at their own rate each starting at a different value and this callback function remembers and you know I want to take this out just to see this callback function remembers to correct context and I can have callbacks now inside of my class timeout and actually uh yeah so um so a great point has been made in the chat actually when I was designing this scenario in my head to do this video this is actually not the way I wrote it in my head I meant to not get rid of the count it function so let me just put that back for a second so I'm gonna rewrite this a little bit which I think I'll be a little bit more clear and I'm gonna keep this in the counted function I actually am going to make a variable called this dot weight and have it equal to weight and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to write a new function and I'm gonna call it a start and there I'm gonna say this dot count so this is kind of what I meant count it this is I just rewrote this but in an anything is slightly more clear way because now I have I'm creating a counter object it has a starting counter as an amount of time to wait and a Dom element associated with it it has a function which will always increase the count and put the count in the Dom element and then as the start function is what and this should say by the way I'm forgetting the this dot this dot weight but here this would break once again that's just put this back to function right this totally makes sense set interval this function count it with this amount of weight and I'm gonna say counter one dot start and counter to start by the way I could make an array of these all with random starts counter three dot start now let me run this uncaught count it is not a function because it's forgotten function for is because it gets kind of globalized it forgot about the current actual context of this and it's just referring to window replace it with the arrow syntax and now but uh there we have our counter objects all counting separately so I hope this helped somewhat make some sense of the arrow function there's so much more to the arrow function and I will talk about that in a next series of videos I'm gonna look at some scenarios where using the arrow function in connection with array functions like Map Reduce and filter could be helpful to you yeah and so just to double back for a second on being completely totally what though that sort of like oneline way of writing this I could actually get rid of these brackets and this semicolon right because I can just now do this so in theory if you like to write code like this this should also work let's refresh yes so this is now way to write this in one line I completely confused myself looking at this I kind of have no idea what's let me see if I can understand it I want to set an interval and what I want is for this dot count it to happen every this dot weight amount of time okay it kind of makes sense you know it's a little it's a little bit cryptic and weird cuz there's no arguments inside these parentheses but we'll see what happens we put argument aside those parentheses in another video thanks for watching I hope this context somewhat helps and I'll probably come back because I think this is the first time I've ever taught about arrow functions and I only really learned about them a couple weeks ago so just you know be kind okay and not to but to everybody please in the world be kind alright talk to you soon goodbye alright how did I do everybody I don't think I can remove this someone's saying I can remove this but that won't work yeah that won't work because it's not it's what you're kind of want to do is this and that won't work because we've lost track once again so the only way to do it is here all right really all of this and I could have just done this no thank goodness this also lost track of this does not work as well yeah I could have done this right there we go I don't know it's that better I don't know no right aren't I supposed to use the arrow function now not bond anymore somebody tell me somebody help help me out with this I'm gonna get that I'm gonna get this in the comments aren't I Alki see Alka is typing I will get an answer no code yes there will be a coding challenge today yeah so I don't know I'm gonna put this back to like this all right all I did was arrow function wait bind is mine to find is ugly I agree okay let's all right so we got to move on here everybody okay we got to move on oh here that's me that's me what am i okay so let's see what can I do now we got to do some coding challenge stuff so I wanted to do word to Veck and I wanted to do the let's do the circle more I'm gonna actually do the circle morph in it in an easy way famous last words all right so I'm gonna say this oh let me do a workflow video I want to do a workflow video here's the thing I got to do this because this is making me crazy and you guys can give me some advice here so I have this playlist and I put this oh no sorry here look it's my act so here I put this 1.2 p5.js with brackets as a like oh maybe I'll just show people how to use brackets because the desktop editor is deprecated the web editor isn't really released yet people who are beginners are just starting to learn work with p5 what should I have them use so I you know attempted to use code pen but you know that's gonna have its own set of issues once you start to build out larger projects so I made this video with brackets and almost almost all the comments are are I can't get it to work because the way the p5 download now is different so what I'm thinking is is it crazy I mean I hate to have all these steps for a beginner but maybe I just have to admit that this is the case and it's time for me to make the workflow video to end all workflow videos and to use install node n p.m. G install and a p5 manager so then you could say p5 generate be you know sketch name open with Adam and then what know HTTP server with node simple Python server or Adam live server package is there a better for the total beginner starting point than this maybe just download the you know from p5 just from the web but it comes with this weird on directory structure so I'm curious for some advice and comments so let me see here Oh code pen has a special editor for larger projects called projects I term oh boy I forgot about I term p5 manager also has a local host so oh I'm not even on the screen right now so I think I'm gonna try I'm gonna try this isn't going to be the most beginner friendly workflow video and I won't go through all the steps to install p5 manager because I have a separate video wrap on a docker layer yeah and no I don't think so let me I'm gonna do this I'm gonna erase all this now and I will probably rewrite it that was me sticking it through only thing about the one thing I want to look at what the p5 manager is when you generate a project how does it get which version on the p5 library because I noticed it wasn't getting the most recent one I don't think so cloud9 is great so I kind of want to do though here's the thing I don't really I don't know why I'm saying this because there's also glitch which is fantastic I kind of don't want to do use a web an online editor eventually I will use the p5 web editor and make other videos with what but it's true that actually my students here at NYU are kind of at the point in the semester where a lot of them want to work offline so I think I'm gonna do that alright so I'm going to quit everything on this computer and here we go here we go so hello this is me again trying to make a workflow video I've made a bunch of them but I always get lots of questions there are always problems with them so I am now going to make a video that describes my entire workflow even though I have pieces of this and other videos I'm gonna do it all in this video you could be watching this video as the as you're just starting to learn to program this isn't the most beginner friendly way to just type your first line of code because I gotta have a bunch of steps but at some point I will also come back and show you some other what editors that you could kind of be up and running immediately with so how and I work for I want to I want to make a p5.js sketch I don't want to do it in ink I mean you you should you might want to do this I want to do this also but at the moment I do I want to do this locally on my computer this laptop thing without a cloudbased editor so let me talk about the pieces of the puzzle that I need things that I need is I need to get like some project files the I need all of these files can't let me let me start over here timeout timeout everybody let me find these paper towels this is just I cannot bear such a dirty whiteboard and I also have to get myself to not write so high up there this is gonna help my mental sanity takes me a lot I was sort of like get comfortable is what happens at the beginning of these live streams I've always are so uncomfortable I'm still uncomfortable my teenage let me talk about all the pieces that you need okay so one thing you absolutely need is a working whiteboard marker one thing that you absolutely need have a look at that beautiful is project files now to make a p5.js sketch or really any JavaScript program webpage thing actually all you need is an HTML file because you can write HTML index or HTML you can write can you see this you can write everything you could write all your JavaScript and everything in there but that's not so convenient it's kind of nicer to just have the HTML stuff that you need in there and you need to sketch J's file so you need these project files we could just make these from scratch and type what we need into them but generally we want to get like some sort of template from somewhere so that's one thing we need another thing we need we need a text editor we need something that we can open up these files probably we could have more files and project files and CSS files and image files video files but at a bare minimum this is one we need something where we can edit those files you know you could use just about it if you used TextEdit or notepad or anything really I tend to use something called the atom editor it is an open source text editor thick put out by github there is also a text editor called sublime text which is quite wonderful there's a free version but it's also commercial software that you can pay for there's there's like Visual Studio people tell me they love and the list goes on there's lots of them everybody has their own favorite text editor you can say which one is yours in the comments so we need this and then the third thing we need is a server so here's the thing these are the files this is how we write our code in the files how do we see what we multiply want to do is see the result in a web page and it is true that if you just on any computer doubleclick index.html file will like pop up and open it in the browser but what you might end up seeing is that it's opening it with this path in the address bar file colon slash slash and what we want to do is open it with this path HTTP colon slash slash basically we want to make sure that we are simulating the actual real world way that someone on the internet would view this web page which is they would view it served up on a web server so we want to run a little web server on our local computer to be able to look at it in the browser and there are lots of options for that I could run a node server what's no no my goodness I could run a Python server what's Python oh my goodness ah I could use like an atom server package right there's all these different possibilities so when I forgot to mention there's lots of ways you could get your project files you could just have a friend of theirs they say hey do you have any p5 sketches give me only one and then you can just edit there you're just copy paste copy paste like a hundred times you have under project folders I'm gonna use a tool called p5 manager it's a little bit of overkill right now because it might be easier just to say hey just download and I'll put a link in this video's description to a zip file where you can just download a blank p5 sketch but I'm gonna use this tool called p5 Manager which has a little command line thing you can type it it generates the project for you so I'm gonna use p5 manager to generate the project files I'm going to use a text editor to open the project files I'm then going to type my code into the project files I'm going to run a local server and then look at the beauty that is my results does that make sense again I'm trying to make the workflow video to end all work that covers all the pieces I mean there's so much more but this is kind of what I use alright let's go over this way alright um right right right right right right right right right right and I know by the way there's lots of online editors and code pen and Glitch and there's a new one coming out from p5.js soon so there's so many possibilities but this is this is a way of working just one just one all right so now here we go how do i how do I use this p5 manager thing first of all you have to be a little if you're on a Mac you've got to feel a little comfortable using terminal if you're on Windows so you've got to run this piece of software called terminal it's usually in applications utilities and it looks something like this then you could just magically type p5 generate be my project no no no you can't so here's I think this is the command that I type what this commands meat means is hey generate a p5 project I want it to be a bundle look I can talk about what that is and I want it to be called my project the thing is I'm gonna I'm gonna just pretend there's something called x5 you're gonna see this x5 p5 command not found when I do this it's actually going to work whoops ignore that p5 generate be my project this is actually gonna work when I do it because I've installed p5 manager already and you can see what this did it created a folder called my project and it gave me sketch as index.html and by the way I kind of forgot something important I'm realizing I also need all those library files you actually don't need the library files locally because index dot HTML can like point out to a URL to get the p5 libraries and you'll see that in a lot of examples and things but i but the p5 manager will actually give you those library files locally all right here we go now ok so how do you how do you install this p5 manager one thing is I do have a video where I go through how to install this in more detail but I'm gonna do it here anyway but you can I'll link to that p5 manager video as well so the thing that I need is a piece of software called node and node is a JavaScript runtime built on chrome v8 JavaScript engine blah blah blah blah it's a thing that lets you run JavaScript programs on your computer and on servers and lots of other places so you're gonna want to download this and install it and you'll know that it's working one of the things you can type by the way in terminal is clear and then I'll clear everything you'll know that it's working if you just take node and you get that there so pause this video install node go back to your terminal type in notes see if you get this and you can do things like 5 + 7 oops 5 plus 7 and it gives you 12 so you can run a little JavaScript I'm gonna hit ctrl C and 2 eggs again press ctrl C again I'm gonna hit clear so once you have node installed you need to use something called NPM you've already got it installed and to install the p5 manager you have to say npm install p5 manager now here's the thing you also want to say gee what this means is I want to install this thing called p5 manager and is a global thing for my computer I want to be able to always type p5 manager wherever I am I'm gonna hit enter you might have a problem it might already installed it but I'm gonna let it kind of go anyway and I got an error so here's the problem I forgot that in order to distill something globally on my computer I have to say sudo by ok what am i doing by the way the up arrow the uparrow allows you to scroll through previous commands so I can go back and find this command and I'm going to now say sudo which stands for Super User do which will give me the permission to install it Oh detected my password that's Rick is there we go now I think I'm not having like I did the same stick in a different video so it's installed so that's great I'm gonna hit clear and now I can so here's the thing I can now use that p5 command and look it's telling me I'm running p5 manager zero point three point two I don't know why the color became all weird here I like selected something I don't know what's going on but I'm gonna just pretend that's not happening now here's the thing where do I want to make my project well let's say I just want to put the project on the desktop here's a command that's useful for you PWD print working directory and you can see this is the director I'm in user slash processing my user name is processing on this particular login it should probably be coding train or whatever but now I can say CD for change directory like maybe I just want to go to the desktop so now if I say PWD here we go and guess what let's say actually want to go to some weird folder on my computer if I go and say like oh there's this like coding train folder and it's frog or and I want to put something in there I can actually just drag the folder into here let go and that's the whole path users processing documents old desktop PC D coding train fragra so I don't need to do that right now and hit ctrl C and the camera went off the moment I hit ctrl C and I'm just gonna say clear I'm gonna say PWD I'm on the desktop and now I'm gonna say p5 generate B B stands for bundle p5 will actually generate you this whole like file system management for a lot the p5 manager for a lot of different sketches I personally just like to generate one sketch at a time so that's what B does be coding train one so here we go hit enter it created all those things and now just to be sure I'm gonna minimize all my windows and look at this on my desktop is this folder called coding train one and it now has index dot HTML sketch touch yes and all the library files that I need step one is done again just one way to do that you just need these files you can make them from scratch you can download some where you can copy them from a previous project but step one is done using p5 manager now I need step two so again so many different possible text editors let's use the atom editor so atom editor is a piece of software you can get by going I don't know Adam dot IO and you can see here is the atom ID up in the wrong window the atom software is a piece of software you can get by going to a DeMayo and you can do download for whatever your operating system is here you can see this is kind of what it looks like it is a text editor hooray I already have atom installed so I'm going to go down here and I just gotta use the search bar to type in Adam so I'm gonna run the Adam application it's open it already has opened a bunch of things won't look like this for you that's unfortunate let me try this again close this how can I make it let me how could I make it launched for the first time again probably like in the that's good and the preferences like open empty at our own star mmm previously I might lease a product State detected oh I don't know editor Oh AK well I'll just live with it it's gonna have some welcome e stuff for you that's fine all right I'm gonna go ahead and just find Adam on the computer and I'm going to I've already downloaded open it and you can see it's just opening this blank page you'll probably see some like welcome messages and stuff I've used it quite a few times so it's just opening something blank and then I can do file open I can go to the desktop and I can just select this coding train folder and I can press open and then boom we can see here in the left pane these are my files and this is blank and I can click on sketch and I have the code ready to go so if I add something like background zero and let's make it like a green color just to be sure this is working or I've added some code now I am going to do what I'm gonna just I'm gonna throw caution to the wind and I'm going to don't do this don't try this at home double click this index.html file and it works so this is okay it's a very bad habit please please please that's making me so uncomfortable it's all green and bright but you can see here this is what I'm trying to avoid it opened the HTML page via the file system and while just drawing a green background it had no problem with that there are many other areas where you can have a problem so what I really want to do is run a local server now we're now done with step two so now I need to go to step 3 hmm what local server should I run I have a video I made a long time ago I ran a Python server I think I used a node server and another one I think I might have used the atom live server package I don't know which to use huh you know what the p5 Manager comes with its own server let's see if we can use that I'll show in fact I think I'll just show you a bunch so so one thing I could do I got an open terminal back up one thing I can do is first of all I want to be in the directory of my sketch or in a directory above actually would be fine let's just run the load I don't know let's change into the directory I'm gonna do this I'm gonna hit clear again so I could type some command to run a local server for example this is a command if you have Python installed on your computer which a Mac will and I'm probably easy to download install Pike Python in a PC that is now running a local server and if I go to the browser and type in localhost colon 8080 go gel calm or yahoo.com but instead of that web server somewhere off in the Internet I want to connect to localhost the web server running on this laptop right here and 8000 is a port so when you connect to a webpage it's usually on the default port 80 and you don't specify it but this local server it told me right here it's running it on port 8000 so that's on you to type 8000 there is another node package I could install sudo npm install g HTTP server i think that's what it's called dot server server so i could install this node package i already probably did and then I could say HTTP server and now it's running a server there it is 8080 there it is it's running a server 8080 and you can see this is my local IP address so now I could take go there and put this and I'm running the sketch hold so many things guess what else I could do p5 has one like p5 server look at that it started a server at port five five five it's so many options for servers it's amazing five by five oh my goodness look at this did though I don't know oh boy it's giving me some sort of fancy something or other oh boy so now I'm a little bit lost all my projects would be to the left I might need to go oh boy up so the p5 server does something fancy timeout I need to create a collection to run the p5 server so I guess it doesn't work for standalone projects I'm gonna let's back that up and let's so those of you watching the livestream you'll get a little extra tidbit there you can use the p5 manager in fancier ways but I'm going to that's you we will we will stop at this and go on to the next server option another thing that I could do is a lot of these text editors will come with a special plugin or by default of a menu option which says like preview run live server that type of thing I brackets is one that I did a previous video on that has a little button that you press which is for a live preview and it runs a server so Adam one of the things you can do with Adam is you can under here there's packages now you'll see I already have dev lot no no I just say you don't have it so I don't have so this is perfect so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to see can I install a live server package with Adam so packages oh so Adam I want to go to preferences you start for you to see what I'm doing I'm going to preferences and then I want to go to install which is right here install and then I want to look for I'm gonna search for a live server dev live reload oh maybe that's what oh no Adam look so this is the circum something that I've installed dev live reload maybe that does the trick to Adam live servers what I was thinking of so I'm gonna click install and it's gonna do something takes a little while I guess let's try this dev live reload one well oh no it installed it installed okay it installed cuz I know that because now it says uninstall or disable and now I can go back to where here I don't know packages live Adam Auto indent bracket wait Oh what I have to restart Adam I have to restart Adam then I'm going to packages where's the live server thing hold on preferences install live server it's there Adam life server no how come I'm not seeing it does it go somewhere else I guess by the way I should just use this one because it seems that it comes with it does anybody know if dev live reload comes with comes with Adam so I don't even have to install it ctrl alt L everybody everybody's telling me their own way of doing it in the chat its dev live reload ok Oh baby that's what it is actually it's just called that now is that what it's called now I don't know hold on let's be sure about this ah why is life so hard if I delete Adam it's a terrible idea and redownload it if it's by Adam than I think it's default nope this computer's gonna run out of power all right come on and then let's let me try running at him again I don't know if that actually wiped my install yes I want to open it mmm I don't think it did that's it still has all my settings I just deleted the application it's an internal atom dev thing but why does the live server package not showing up here atom live server let's just run them no yeah this is reload all styles is something else do me I have to enable it all right cuz here packages I have this Oh Oh somebody what you guys use the shortcuts yeah that's nice that there's shortcuts but I'm happy to use shortcuts but I would like to demonstrate running it without them alright let's at least try the shortcut what was it again ctrl yeah yeah I've always seen it here when I've have it installed totally lost in here q map keybindings in naval control alt 3 does it for 3,000 disabled this if you want to bind your own keystrokes I don't really want to do that all right I guess I should use what was it alt command3 no control all three no well I'm stumped here with this live server thing control P command P no do I have to have like be in an HTML file for it to find window selection view edit first come in then alt then L and one it's not working for me alright maybe I should just give up on this live server package thing preferences it's packages stable enable this make me crazy oh thank you compiled for an earlier a rebuild package thank you that was the problem ah there we go all right Thank You Andrea Andrea I'm sorry not pronouncing your name correctly there we go okay so now packages now look I don't know where this is gonna pick up from packages now I have that installed I can just go to Adam life server start server there are keyboard shortcuts to automatically launch it but I'm gonna launch it here and boom there it is and there there's another local server at this address and that port and what's interesting about this now is look at the green color I'm just gonna go to my code and I'm going to add this color I'm gonna hit save and then I'm an alt tab to the browser it's live reload so as I change the code like okay well actually I just wanted to 600 by 400 canvas and I want to have like a random something I don't know you can see it's continuously reloading the page for me which is wonderful so okay to recap to recap all the pieces that I'm using are getting my project files from p5 manager which is a node module so we need to download and install node so I can write some terminal commands with nodes I am using a text editor I happen to be using atom but any text editor will do then I want to view the results of my code in the web browser so I need to run a server now someday you might watch a video where I explain how to program your own server for all sorts of interesting things and I'll link to those videos as well you can write your own node server but you can use a built in node server you can use a built in Python server if you have Python you could look for a plugin for your text editor just I'm sure the comments of this video will be filled with lots of other suggestions of how to run your own server there's a couple important things that I want to point out by the way could someone tell me what I should recommend is sort of like the equivalent for terminal on Windows it probably came through but I missed it so here's something really important something that you might notice in a lot of my examples is I have this other pane open in the browser where I can see error messages or I can do console log statements and the way I'm doing that in chrome it's different in different browsers it's under view developer JavaScript console so if I click that the JavaScript console it now pops up over here you can see Adam is even talking to it because it's say hey you've got I've got the live reload enabled so one thing the couple important points about this number one is you might not appear there for you it might be on the bottom you can pop it out you can kind of control where it goes somewhere I here note here Here I am you can you can look right here and you can see how I could put it on the bottom or I could pop it out so that's one important thing another really key thing and depending on what the server using is but I like to keep something checked if I go here under settings and I scroll all the way down to network this is a pretty important setting disable cache while dev tools are open this is a setting you want to have checked because sometimes browsers they'd really like to remember stuff they like say you know what I you're asking me to do something I already you asked me did this a while ago I'm just gonna do what you've asked me a while ago because it's faster but if you changing your if you're changing your code a lot you don't want it by accident run your old code so this will disable its ability from caching some previous version of your code and running that instead whenever these JavaScript console is open so if you have that set you will never have that problem and I can just go and I wasn't having that problem because the live reload is probably you know can change all these colors and it's it's changing my code but that's an important sort of detail there all right all right other question I'm sure a lot of you are asking is if you're using Windows what do you use but is it as the equivalent of this terminal application so there is just the command prop on Windows there are also some I'm reading the chat here some things that you can install like cygwin c YG wi n there are some other tools like you can install the Linux file system maybe in Windows 10 it actually does this for you I have no idea I'm lost so if somebody writes a helpful comment about the what to do for your terminal in Windows I will pin that comment to the top of this video's page so maybe look for there and see if that's there what else am I forgetting I'm gonna pause for a second and check the chat and see if I missed anything and for this video ends yeah git bash is a good suggestion okay let me look I'm looking at the chat here just to see yeah how do you use p5 serve get bash yeah that's the chat is telling me that get bash is also an excellent tool for Windows actually one that I've used before so you can download something called git bash I will include a link to that as well in this video's description alright I think I've covered everything just just to like I think I feel like I should do a whole video just on the console alone but so maybe I'll do that but just to like at least put something in there I can do stuff like console dot log you know Mouse X if I put that into my code what I'm gonna see is I'm gonna be able to debug the value of the mouse as I'm running it and if I have some kind of error like I misspelled background and don't put the D on the end you can see uncaught reference error background is not defined so this is where I say sketch digest line number 6 so I can go back and see line number 6 that's where my error is so that JavaScript console is really a useful tool to get used to using and practice using so I hope this video didn't end up being super long and I hope that you found it helpful and I'm sure I'll end up remaking this again because workflows and tools is acknowledged used to just change constantly and thanks very much for watching all right how are we doing everybody I'm not staying hydrated oh there's my water bottle I need to go fill it I couldn't find it and I thought I'll be fine alright what do we got here what else we got here it's getting close to 600 we're running out of steam a little bit ok circle Morphin we got to do that I did this oh my god did I really do that it was kind of horrific oh and I want to do the word Tyvek stuff that might have to come next I should do at least one more of these let's do the circle more thing let's do this circle oh I forgot about like all those other packages you know ken right can I ever do everything in the video impossible huh Matthieu if you want to pay if you want to splice this in towards the end you can there are also by the way in addition that live circuit server package a lot of other useful packages that you can install that modify how atom behaves hi syntax color for different programming languages and things one that I use quite a lot is atom beautify and I'm you can map the key yet so I guess I got to come back into another video about atom packages if that's of interest but I'm gonna leave that here alright let's do some let's do some circle morphing let's go to github.com goal on Leavitt go on probably no goal on 11 circle more thing Hey look at that go on Leben wait what are all these other URLs apples to orchard feed tonic fascinating so let's go to repositories circle morphing okay so I could certainly do this one I was thinking actually of me find my I think the paper towel is better at erasing then so maybe I should do maybe I'm gonna do two so maybe I'll do one where I compute all the points of a circle that I know how to do how do i compute very quickly and easily all the points of a triangle bill I like doing the square before so let's say the circle has 90 points each side the triangle would have 30 points but no three of those points are shared oh my god I'm really gonna have to look at Golan's code and then I yellow it so the side the this is the reason why what I wanted to do actually is so let me think about this for a second all right is it okay we'll do a little bit of like pre pre planning this video so that's an equilateral triangle this is a circle so this would be the point at 90 degrees this way and then this would be the point at right is that perfectly that's not half right the because this is this is 60 degrees 60 degrees those points if I look are they at 30 degrees or at 45 degrees super state I also have a super shape also do a super shape morphing yeah that could be good 30 yeah right because isn't this sixty degrees is right okay so wait a second so if this is sixty degrees and this is half this would be thirty right yeah this is thirty so so I'm looking for those points the way I was thinking of doing it was just randomly deleting all the other points and having a collapse unto itself that was that's one way of doing it the other way would be to calculate the perimeter path for the triangle as well I seems like such a pain and neck there must be an easy way to calculate the perimeter of an equilateral triangle around the center point right how would I do that I can I could start here I know I need to get here so I can just calculate all the points along the line between those two guess that's what I would do all right let me think about this hold on somebody in the chat is giving me a good suggestion stop using degrees and you spread C rational trigonometry oh that's probably a good idea just rotate by 120 three times for the points that's also a good idea gives you super shapes to create a triangle oh that's clever I see that is a really good point all right hold on Alka is giving me an excellent suggestion let's see if I can understand this that's like how Co is gonna make me appear that I'm smart yeah cuz what we could do is of course but Alka isn't that the those are the points for that's the points for the circle isn't it what the code that you just pasted and it is using sine and cosine just underneath the hood with the rotator right that wouldn't do a triangle a circle yeah so I need so that I that have good awareness is my head so let's let's get started okay so I'm gonna the funny thing is I did this before and I never released it because it was kind of a disaster so I'm gonna do use Bezier curves I know oh that's a cool light there's so many great ideas but I want you could say count equals three for a triangle yes but I want all the intro what I want to do this is what I want to do for that I think for the most basic way to teach this is to the most basic way to teach this is to maybe I don't want to do it this way but is to let's say I do the circle and it's this many points so this is right let's say I'd make the circle and it is oh I think I know what to do now I think I have an idea of what to do but so basically I can compute these points around this path but I want to compute this point for this one this point for this one in this point for this one so that way I can move these around so if I do this this is starting from here if I do this six for sixty degrees if I calculate all of these points and then all the equivalent number of these points then I could do the same thing for here and the same thing for here and I just need two arrays and then I need to work with both those arrays all right so that's what I'm gonna attempt to do yeah and I can use lerp right right exactly that's what exactly is thinking so I can just as I calculate this point this is like if this is ten degrees that's one six I just need to go one six of the way ha okay here we go everybody so we're gonna make this coding challenge happen circle morphing remember how I was gonna do webcam painting everything started it all made so much sense earlier today 120 I think I do mean 120 I one do 60 plus 6 oh yeah 120 I mean 20 everybody hundred twenty hundred twenty all right here we go circle morphing alright alright alright alright hello you're watching a video where I'm watching a video look that's goal on and that's me last week look I trim my beard I'm tied if you didn't watch this video before goal on a guest here on the coding train give a wonderful lecture about interpolation in artist from an historical perspective and then showed 10 different ways of morphing from a circle to a triangle so now in this video I'm going to close that and there's a github repository which I will link to which has 10 different 14 different ways why don't I say 10 so many different ways of transforming a circle into a square no actually if you could believe this my opponents watch go away everybody um I haven't looked at the code for any of these and so what I want to do and I have done this before I failed that it miserably I'm going to do this twice I'm gonna just try two different techniques in this video I am going to try to transform from a circle to a triangle and the the constraint that I want to give myself is that I only want to work with begin shape and end shape and a perimeter of points around a circle and then I want to be able to take that perimeter and make it a triangle come back there's lots of different ways I could do that the first way that I'm going to do that is just work with the exact same number of points but define the shape of the triangle and then move the points around and this is what unlocks a ton of creative potential as the points could spring back and forth they could mix themselves up they could use some kind of fancy bouncing easing algorithm they could twirl but I'm just gonna like move them from one spot to the other so I'm gonna set up a template from which you could be creative and you can make your own circle morphing example you could tweet it with a gif or whatever any way you like ok so let's get started doing this alright um pause timeout for a second here what do I want to say here p5 G B circle morphing okay so see the circle morphing Python M simple HTTP server and let's open it up an atom desktop circle morphing open and let's get the code going let me say create canvas 400 400 and background 20 and so it drives me crazy that's like I change my template and make this a little bigger and put in the JavaScript console and now here we go all right okay so let me come back all right actually before I go over there one thing we could notice here is that the points of an equilateral triangle rests on the circle and if I just for a second think of this as zero degrees this is 120 degrees this is 240 degrees so again I have a think of it if maybe I should start if this is negative 90 I should be a little more thoughtful about the math but I think this is gonna be useful because as I'm calculating these points I want to calculate these points as well to create both of those perimeters at the same time and there's so many different ways you can do this don't get me wrong I'm trying to pick the simplest not the most elegant beautiful or accurate just the simplest maybe it's not the simplest I'm sure you could think of some simpler ways but let's come back over to the code now so the first thing that I need to do is I need to have two arrays I'm going to say let circle paths be an array let triangle and look I don't know why but I'm feeling like I want these to be the same number of characters so circle path and triangle path I want a raise I'm going to put vector objects ap5 vector object is just an x and a y so what I could do here in a really sort of simplistic way just for a second is I could and let's let's change angle mode to degrees just to like save ourselves some some pain so I'm gonna say for let angle equal 0 angle is less than 120 angle plus Plus now I probably want to have some sort of variable to keep track of like how many points so maybe let's just make a variable called its spacing right now I this is not great but let's say we're gonna do something every ten degrees just have it be kind of low resolution right now so I say angle plus equal spacing so to get the points along a circular path I can use polar to Cartesian transformation which means that if I have a certain angle and a radius I can calculate the XY here as x equals radius times cosine of the angle y equals radius times sine of the angle all right so that's something that I definitely can do that's how I want to create the vectors for every angle with a certain radius now here's the thing I really would love to derive these formulas for you but I will point you instead toward a video where I do that it's a polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation video pretty sure I made one so now if I come back over here I'm gonna say circle but let's let V and let me just make this a so that it's not as long winded V let's say V for vector equals creon let me actually let X equal and I need some sort of radius so radius let's just say 104 right now x equals radius times cosine of the angle let y equal radius times sine of the angle let V equal create vector I'm being very longwinded here XY and now I'm going to say circle path dot push V so if I run this code and I look at circle path I can see I have 12 vectors and these are all the points 100 comma 0 98 point 4 8 comma symbolic so you can see all these points here now in theory the next point right with the angle at exactly 120 would be and this is a little bit silly that I'm going to do this because I definitely don't need to do it as 3 for loops but I'm just gonna divide it into 3 just for right now because I think this will help me and then and again absolutely all of you can think of magical ways so now this should give me all the points and honestly let's you know let's comment these out because let's just go what happens I'm gonna get to that let's go to the draw part and because let's at least look at how do I draw that perimeter so now I want to say stroke 0 no fill begin shape and shape is it there some fancy new es6 way I'm supposed to iterate through an array equals 0 that's not even for each I is less than circular path length I plus plus and now I'm going to say vertex so let me say let V let V equal circular path index I so I want to look at each of those vectors one at a time what am I doing here I wanna say begin shape and and shape to draw that path and I want to say V X V dot Y so let's see what do I get here well there it is that's part of it why is it up there I want to think about everything relative to the center of the of the canvas so at the beginning I'm also gonna say translate width / 2 height / all right here we go there look that's 120 degrees part of a circle now could I possibly get the triangle path as well let's see if I can so I know that what I could do with the triangle path right here is I could say let a start equal zero let let a end equal 120 and then triangle path dot push I guess I could I'm just sort of working this out in my head right so I have X start Y start and this is very silly what I'm doing x and y and I'm just working this out so I want the start and end of this line that's the side of the triangle I want to start at zero degrees and at 120 degrees and so I need to do the start angle for the starting point and the end angle for the ending point and then I want to say create vector X s Y s and x and y n so I just want it this is just me working out the math right of how do I get I just want to get this is like this point and this is this point so if I do that a path between those I'll just draw a straight line so I'm this so many ways this could be improved but let's just see if this is right okay well I have to also draw the triangle path and yeah I guess I'll just do that as a separate loop triangle path and triangle path there we go so you can see now this it's going all the way I didn't have that loop go to the next angle but the triangle side goes all the way that way okay so I've got both now here's the thing what how do I want to do this I want to figure out these points inside of this loop as well so I think what makes sense is for me to actually say start angle equals zero end angle equals 120 start angle end angle then I want to say start V equals create vector radius times cosine of start angle I just want to get those those points I'm gonna kind of do it in one line radius times sine why is everything so complicated start angle all right so I want to get that start V and that end V which will be end a and a so I think I created two vectors and they're really I could just call them start and end okay I wish I could there's so many ways that could be proved but I'm working it out I'm working it out okay now what I want to do is let's just say just to like sort of see what's going on here what if I just say triangle path dot push start so I'm just gonna put that start in a bunch of time so we don't need this anymore this was me just working it out so if I run this okay nothing but now what if I use oh there's a lurk function so there's a loop function right if I use the lerp function if I have a start and I have an end and i lurk between those two values by 10% it's going to give me this point right here and i can do that with a vector I could use a lurk with the vector function linear interpolation to get ten percent from one XY to another XY so what I'm going to do now is say let so this should be the circle vector and the triangle vector equals start start I think if I say start lurk it's gonna give me a new vector mmhmm I don't know let's see start lurk end and I need you know what I think I need to do I need to say p5 dot vector when I say p5 dot vector dot lerp and I want to say I'm going in between the start and the end and what is the what am I what's how far along am I the purse I'm a certain percentage a / n de start a so the the amount to lurk is whatever that angle is / start end angle start angle that's triangle vector triangle vector okay so this is now how I'm getting looks kind of crazy so I'm getting the circular path the traditional way oops by calculating these points one at a time and then while I'm doing that I know this beginning point in this end point so let me calculate these points along the way and let's see if this works a property lerp of undefined skip hold on sorry ah let me uh let me undo this for a second hold on I have to fake this while I'm taking a break let me see what horrible things people are telling me in the chat all right there's a whole other conversation going on that I will so let me now ups so let me try to run this whoops hit refresh Oh uncut type error hmm sketch that jazz line 19 Oh vectors that's an easy one it's just spot vector okay I see the circle hmm so circular path it has a bunch of vectors in it that looks like it makes sense let's look at the triangle path it has a bunch of vectors in it they all look like they're the same point oh I forgot to say the amount well I spent all that time calculating the amount I just say lurk between the start and the end by a certain amount whoo myself a little more room here now let's try this one more time there we go yeah okay so it looks like I have the side of the triangle well this is a lot of work by the way the nice thing about this if you just do the path stuff once you can kind of have it done for all the different ways you want to do your morphing but that said here we go so now there's got to be a clever way I can go all the way to 360 right and I could probably use modulus to change the start and the end right yeah and so by the way there are all these great suggestions in the chat about how to do the morphing in a smarter way and I'll get to that but I want to do it this way just this is this is gonna unlock or like a lock all the potential weight oh I guess I could just like copypaste this but I can't bring myself to do this so what I want to do is this I want this to go all the way to 360 right I want this to go all the way to 360 and then I want the if angle mod 120 equals zero again this is only going to work from multiple some number that's going to like get to 120 but that's gonna be a multiple of one that's going to divide into 120 with a remainder of zero if the angle mod 120 equals zero then I should be able to say start a equals start a plus 120 and end a equals end a plus 120 right I know I could do plus equals right I should be able to just move those and then I also need to redo these right so by the way I should really make a function let me just make a function polar Karthik polar to Cartesian and it just takes their R and an angle and it returns a create vector this is going to make our life so much less awkward R times cosine of the angle R times sine of the angle and I'm sure I could write that I should write that with the arrow notation but I'm not going to all right so I just want to make this function because that way now I can just say pole I could just say polar polar what did I call it polar to Cartesian radius start a an end this is at least and radius end a and then here also I could say polar to Cartesian radius a right so this sort of makes things a lot less weird so hold on let me let me just put this back to 120 just to see if this still works yeah what I do polar to Cartesian out saying is not define I did some crazy typing oh I pasted something in there I didn't mean to there we go that's still working now what I can do is I can make this 360 and I can just do this again and reset these variables what will this do yeah yikes I got close so first of all that's the wrong place what is going on so it looks so nice to start with and something crazy happened so what am I missing here if a modulus now these are floating point numbers so is it possible that something weird is happening I don't think so no all right what is wrong here I need less than or equals do I know because I mean I know I won't get to the end but I don't want less than or equals hold on this chat is Oh Oh No well yeah a a equals oh I forgot about a No I'm thinking about this you don't stop incrementing the start and end angles at 360 I don't oh wait wait wait no no this is right amount is this oh you know what this is no this a ah this is the problem okay this is the problem I'm not a percentage of the way through this a has to cycle this this should really be like I write I and then I want and this should be I modulus 120 and here I've got to say let a equal I modulus 120 because I can so why am I doing this the problem is I know I want to go all the way around from zero all the way to 360 but I want to think of these as like 120 degree chunks so that oh no no no no no oh so the percentage of the way through is actually okay I don't even back I have to calculate that percentage of the way through relative to 120 240 240 to 360 so coming back here this is actually I this is actually easier than I think I don't I was thinking about I had to change the variable but a will actually work all I need to do is just say a end a right I don't start a so how far is a since the start compared to the end from the start well no that's totally not right all right hold on what did I mess up here mmhmm okay so if I just get rid of the triangle for a second the circle is fine doesn't close but that's fixable the triangle the start points let's console.log this let's take a look at this one twenty two forty two forty three sixty three sixty four eighty oh well that's fine that's what I want so I'm missing something else so these points should be right and the amount let's console.log the amount let's make the spacing really high like thirty right whoa why am I getting oh I'm getting a negative number oh don't tell me it's just because start a is wait huh why not just multiply the radius on the end of the vector yeah and I could rotate it you guys are all so smart is the missing semicolon on line 22 yeah okay so that's what I should do right whoever said that in the chat thank you yo yo gem this would make more sense also yeah how I had to some hold on what's wrong with my triangle hold on whoa what is going on the endpoint is wrong somehow I must have messed up something in this book no R times cosine angle R times sine of angle create vector angle mode degrees absolute value what's going on this makes sense 25 right hold on let's let's draw I have an idea let's say ellipse start X start dot Y let's draw this is at some point my sure this is good as if at all get what what did I miss see this is what happened I try to do more thing before we're oh I got to give it some sighs what is going on mother I've lost lost it start at X star Y and that xn dot Y all right I'm getting 2033 all right hold on a sec these are points start and so why aren't these drawing anywhere hold on a sec let's try this oh wait a second okay so things are correct in theory like there's the triangle how come I'm not getting the points in between correct because and angle is it is there something to the hold on as the order is it because I'm going from like zero to 360 and if I actually start from like negative 90 or something no I'm not drawing over it with background oh this isn't set up yeah I'm sorry I forgot that diamond set up oh I'm a to fish so that was a big waste of debugging I'm trying to draw stuff and I'm in setup okay so that works that's the triangle that's the circle why am I not getting the point so let me if I go here and let me so is the lerp function failing me so a modulus 120 so let's look and the amount is right right this is what I'm printing zero 25% point five point 75 so what is start maybe my understanding of the lerp function is incorrect or maybe the lerp function is broken so what if I said let X equal what am I doing here I'm saying start I'm saying start dot n X x amount plus start dot X times 1 minus amount right let me just do this manually right that's what I'm actually that's what this should be doing whoops and that worked so the lerp function isn't doing what I think it should do let's look up the lerp function maybe we found a bug in p5 p5.js org oh boy well it's 630 what is going on what time of the Dodgers play 820 right lerp no no p5 vector alert see v1 v2 amount it's supposed to do that so did we find a bug because what's alright let's just let me not draw these I just want to draw these as points just for a second just to see them and I'm gonna say stroke wait that's hard to see hold on alright I'm gonna let me back up for a second so I don't know where this I'm gonna try to go to a point Matt Chia where you can edit back to and I'm pretty sure kind of like around here would be good and we're okay so something crazy happened here I'm missing a semicolon somewhere that people are very upset about yeah here all right holy sorry hello you still watching I can't believe it if you're still watching that's amazing to me let me try to pretend I back in this video tutorial now okay one one major issue here is that this I should say modulus 120 the this angle I know I was just talking about this in a different way and then there's like my an edit point but what I want to do is just figure out this is like 120 how far along from 0 to 1 so if I always modulus by 120 I'll get thighs between 0 to 120 by the way go on Levin also did a video tutorials that you could watch so if I have that here I have that here whoa wait a second it's fine did I just have a parenthesis out of place it was the semicolon all along no no okay well I don't know what just happened there but I was I must have had something wrong that I actually don't know what it was somebody watching this video will tell me but now look at this I've got the triangle and I've got the circle I by the way one thing that I did is I while I was trying to debug during the spot that I get edited out you can watch the livestream archive for the full thing is I altered the spacing we tried this weird I just I will not question it but somehow it seems to be fine and then what I want to do now oh whoops I'm pushing these here no I should not be pushing those there hold on that was another thing I was trying to debug oh boy Oh remember when I did the morphing challenge the reason why I didn't edit it into a kite challenge because it never worked what's going on this is so crazy I'm still pushing from the debugging I know yes I do zone out and note no that I'm not in that I'm not but I forget that I'm livestreaming especially at times right now hold on a sec all right everybody let me debug this again let me go back to 30 and it's just like some kind of crazy nonsense let me get rid of the circle let's just look at the triangle that's not correct this is not a triangle and shape clothes would be nice but now let me make sure am i doing anything weird here no so what I want to do is also just do stroke wait for alright hold on let me try it at Matt let me try to get this to a point where maybe the debugging can actually make it in the video so let me go back to here let me go back to here this is not correct let's try to debug this so let me comment out the circular path let me make the spacing a little bit higher but that is not a triangle let me look at what the points are so one way I could look at the points is by saying am I not getting the end well that's it let me let me look at the points by saying point V X well let me draw a circle actually let me just do a separate loop entirely and let me just say fill 0 ellipse V dot X V dot y this is gonna be end up being a long video with a lot of debugging in it look at those points those are the points of a triangle so I'm clearly doing something correct I have them in the wrong order I must have them in the wrong order so this must have something to do with the way I'm starting from 0 and going to 360 and the way that it's giving me different ha all right now all this is right all this is right and where I'm getting my triangle start between start and end that's still right so I definitely have the right points I should generate a 1 or 20 degrees size and rotate so why is the word let let's just out of curiosity let's do this whoa all right if I'm just going from 0 to 120 now let me take this out oops okay ah something weird is going on where a modulus 120 equal to 0 is triggering more quickly so why so hold on console.log a modulus 120 let's look at this 0 30 60 90 that's right put this in here okay let's say console dot log oops huh oh oh oh of course oh oh my goodness zero modulus 120 is zero thank you everybody thank you that was the Brooklyn so I only want this to happen when I don't want this to happen the first time so can I even just say something as long as a is not equal to zero or well let's just do that right now as a fix what was I doing that let's make this 360 again so now what did I do ninety what 23 oh wait I need to put this back in and so this happened again in a bad place I'll figure this out use my overhead camera again yet again I'm doing this is not I'm gonna do the deleting one just scrap this okay hold on we think here so I only when I want to increase the start in the end what an ad and then not but not on that round so so could I do it start at negative 120 no no no that doesn't work I I want to I mean I could just do three separate sections plug the let oh yeah my battery's getting really low isn't it I only have one power for these two laptops I'm the worst programmer ever okay let's see here let's think about this so an equals well hold on let's just do this a equals 120 or a equals 240 these are the only times we want to do it I think just do that whoops that didn't work also great cuz then oh no cause then it'll as soon as a equals 120 and I add to it oh my god I'm losing my mind no but then then it increases this is fine this is so weird let's go through this more methodically a starts at zero a goes up by 30 right 0 30 60 90 120 so I know I don't when a is 0 I don't want to add to it so I corrected that so then once I get to here I want to add to start an end oh but I need to do it before I need to do it when the next one I need to anticipate it is it really as simple as just saying if a plus spacing modulus 120 equals zero is that really what I want yeah [Laughter] thank you good night everybody good night thank you thank you thank you for watching good night I'll see you next week on the coding train good bye who somebody was saying this in the chat all along it's very hard for me to read that chat all right so I don't know how to correct this if much you can possibly make sense out of that but maybe okay so let's recreate that moment in a fake way all right everybody just just humor me please you were me please so I'm gonna go back a while a long while long while it's very dangerous what I'm doing here we're gonna debug that again oh this is so bad such a bad idea okay I'm gonna go back to where I said we're to recreate this moment how do you gonna do this to say the same bad music but look I've been here for two hours and 40 minutes so I have even more I'm gonna erase this as if this never happened I'm gonna keep going back I just want to go back to like where I really started having trouble which is like here there we go remember this remember this remember this now I'm going to look like a really smart person I should copy the worksheet go but you're absolutely right before I did all that undo all right all right this is not correct I have to debug this I actually just debugged it and now I'm in the future kind of good go through what I do bugged it but it took me like Alma probably like 45 minutes see no one wants to watch a 45minute video let's figure out what's wrong so first of all I'm gonna make the spacing I'm gonna make the spacing 30 so that it's less there's less points to work with I also just want to I think I'm just going to not bother drawing the circle so no circle so I could just see the triangle is messed up and okay so what are some of the things that are wrong here ah okay this is definitely wrong this doesn't make sense hey divided by n de start a so let me figure out why that's wrong so if I'm going from zero to 120 that's gonna work because 60 is 50% of the way through now I'm going from 120 to 240 180 divided by 240 minus 120 what though I'm wrong so I need to take 180 minus 120 actually but another way of thinking that is used to modulus operator so because really what I want to do is go 0 1 2001 2001 20 that's what I want to do go 11 made a whole video tutorial also about the modulus operator then I will link to that you can watch alright so this let's take a look at this yeah that is not a tropical no no all right so one thing we could do here that'll help a little bit is I could let me just do this again and let me draw a little circles just to sort of see where those points are then we say fill zero yeah look how interesting these points are kind of in the correct place but the path is going crazy all right hold on hold on a second let's look here and let me conside like because if I just go change this to 120 oh that's not even right Oh hold on a second let's comment this out cool that's right there's something wrong with this modulus thing okay let's think about this let's think about this let's say what are the angles they're 0 30 60 90 120 150 etc what is zero modulus 120 zero so I don't want to all of a sudden add 120 to start end right there at the beginning that's a problem so actually what I want to do is they anticipate it I don't want to do it here I don't want to do it here I don't want to do it here I don't want it here ah before I get to the next one I want to I want to read because I want to go from here to here that's the first part then I want to move start and to do the next part so actually what I want to do it's much simpler than all the other things I've been trying what I want to say a plus spacing modulus 120 that looks right yeah that's right and so now I can do this thank you thank you very much good night that's the end of this video goodbye thank you thanks for watching all right I can't believe I don't know what am i act like well how long have you been watching so far I haven't gotten to the morphing yet but this is good we can go back over there we're getting there I'm sure Levin did not have this much trouble I can now put the circle back in and I don't need to draw these little ellipses although they're useful to see and we now have the circle and the triangle now it's a little bit a little bit off I could probably think about the angles more thoughtfully but I'm just gonna I'm not I'm not really feeling it right now I'm just gonna rotate everything I think by what is it thirty degrees here we go so and now you notice that those things haven't closed that's no problem I could just add this closed parameter to end shape and now I have the triangle and the circle and I can go back to a space thing of 10 and there we go we now have the circle and the right oh thank you thank you thank you alright so now I need to do the morphing well guess what remember all that time I spent figuring out how to do lurk well I can use lurk here what do I want to do I'm gonna have one more array which is the mole I'm going to call this more paths for morph and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna just decide I'm just going to decide that in the beginning I'm going to just make it a circle so more paths push more paths push that circle point so I'm just going to make them more that I'm just going to start as a circle so actually what I'm going to do now is I don't want to draw either of these I just want to draw the morph path I just want to draw the morph path and I'm gonna do that like this morph path and now okay there's the circle now what are we going to do I am going to say and I'm gonna use the lerp function but I'm gonna do the lurk for each X&Y instead of the p5 dot vector lerp I almost wish I had done that before but for example what if I say V equals V dot X equals lerp oh I need the okay so hold on let see Circle V let's just I'm gonna do some sort of bad variable names but see V is for circle path index I T V is for triangle path index I I guess I could make a new vector each time but I'm gonna say V dot X equals lerp see V dot X T V dot X and let me put 0 in there I'm gonna make a variable amount and let's have amount B happening up here let amount equal 0 okay so I'm gonna alert the X by an amount and the Y by an amount and you know what this is so silly I don't actually need a whole separate array that's all this extra nonsense it could be useful but I'm gonna do this in a really simple way I just want to get an x and a y so I'm gonna say let X equal this let X equal that so I want to get a new x and a y which is some amount in between those two X comma Y so with the amount at 0 what do I have all right a circle path where am I using more path still sketch flying 20 get rid of the more path I don't need that anymore so already my amount is 0 semicolon people are yelling at me semicolon semicolon oh and this should be a why these should be wise circle with the amount at zero its circle with the amount at one it's a triangle with the amount at 0.5 it's kind of halfway in between okay now we're kind of done we're kind of done I could just I could do whatever now um what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna let smoothly oscillate between zero and one so I'm gonna make a global variable just call it I'm gonna call it theta because I not using theta anywhere else and I'm gonna use the sine function I'm going to say amount where do I have that amount variable amount equals sine of theta sine of theta and theta plus equal zero point one so the sine function is a gives us a value that oscillates between negative one and one negative one in one oh but I want a number that oscillates between one zero and one so what can I do there I could use the map function but probably really easily I could just add one and divide by two which is so that's gonna say negative 1/2 negative negative one to one adding one becomes between zero and two dividing that by two become zero and one so here we go oh what's happening here everything was going so well but oh do I have like no loop going or something hold on amount let's console dot log amount oh it's just like really slow it's just going really really slow it was a work King Oh because I mean I forgot I'm in angle low degrees and everything I was thinking in terms of radians so let's go up by five there we go whew let's make this stroke weight a little bit wider thicker this is the most basic way the thing is this is all of the work I think because now I could do all sorts of other ways of moving the points around I could cafe them I could start deleting things out of the array added things to the array there's so many possibilities I hope this is a video that makes some sort of sense that you find useful in some way I I am going to do one more you're gonna see one after this that will be released at some point where I'm gonna do this in a really another way it's one of Golan's versions but I'm not sure which one where I'm going to start just I'm gonna take one or I start deleting points so I'm gonna try that next but but make your circle morphing we're gonna this will be on github you can add to the readme to link to your own version of this you can tweet with the hashtag circle morphing lets you could try morphing the circles with square other shapes so many possibilities I can't believe how long this took me and how many problems I had and I hope you enjoyed watching this video thank you thank you thank you very much thank you thank you and good night oh wait wait wait things are there comments yeah I could have used the math function all right okay okay also rotated ooh that would be fun all right um let's take the console log out all right everybody we're gonna do one more video I'm going to circle more thing I might just try to like knock out a few extra things real quick oh whoops that was really painful but fun and now I am going to okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do this in a totally different way hold on just bear with me I'm gonna delete some Cola so an atom I want to open up circle morphing come on Adam circle morphing to remember what I made that arrow function video all right I'm gonna open up a circle morphing to I'm going to get rid of the triangle path I'm gonna get rid of theta I'm going to get rid of start and end all this I'm just gonna go from zero to 360 spacing and get rid of all of this get rid of all this look how simple this one's gonna be let me get rid of this okay all right everybody oh hi again if you made it through the previous coding challenge on circle morphing wow I'm I'm amazed if you didn't that makes a lot of sense to me you could be here anyway this is gonna be much simpler well famous last words this is probably gonna be like really complicated and I don't check the time maybe this video is like three and a half hours long my glasses are all smudged my hair is falling out it's been like I've been here for like 17 hours straight coding things there's no windows in this room anyway but but here we go okay let's see so what do I have now I have taken my last circle morphing coding challenge and I've made this very very simple sketch it's very little code in it it has an array called circle path it has the spacing variable as a function to convert a radius and angle to of the polar core into a Cartesian coordinate and then it just makes the circle path and draws the circle path here it is and there's the circle it's so nice it's so lovely it's so round and elegant and quiet and I'm happy with it now I want to turn this into a triangle and I don't want to get lost in all this code like I got lost before let's figure out if we can do this in a simpler way and one way I could do this is this is all my notes from before what do you think about it remember I have the circle it's all these points then I have think about a triangle which is really just the path of these points what if I just start deleting these other points so eventually I left wit I have maybe like 90 points around but I'm left with just three points I think I could do this so what I need to do is start deleting the points so one kind of crazy thing I could just try which I know won't really work is I could say I'm gonna say here at the beginning of draw I'm gonna do one per frame while circle path length is greater than three not while if if circle path that length is greater than three if there's more than three points let's get rid of one so I'm gonna say I'm going to say let index equal floor random circle path length that's me picking a random index from this particular rate I should do this at the end of draw cuz I should at least draw it once with all the points so let's do this at the end of draw this videos gonna be so short I'm so excited I didn't code the beginning part but I did in the last video okay so if I find that then I'm just gonna say circle path dot splice index 1 I'm just gonna delete that just it's gone I'm gonna bleed it let's watch this down let's I got a triangle so every single time this is kind of kind of like morph to be a triangle but it's not the equilateral triangle so what I need to do is only pick a valid set of points so what are the valid index values so I need to have an array I'm gonna call indices indices plural of index and while I'm doing this I'm gonna say indices I'm gonna have a variable called let I equals 0 and I'm gonna say Indus indices dot push hi so I want to put all the index values that are in this array into a separate arrange yeah that's probably a better way to do this but this is the way I'm thinking about it first so now what I'm gonna do is instead of picking a random number this is kind of nuts I'm going to first I'm gonna use our pick a random number that's part of the indices then I am going to and so this is indices that link bear with me for a second I think I might need to diagram this hold on this could get edited out it's me erasing stuff me doing my physical therapy which is pushing on the wall let me know so what I'm doing is actually completely redundant and unnecessary but it's gonna allow me to do something else in a moment so I have this array you could imagine this is one array maybe it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 elements in it 0 through 7 and these are all of those points these are all the vectors XY XY these 7 points now I make another array which just has 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 & 7 in it so now I could start saying hey let me take this out of here what number is that oh it's a 3 go delete the third one okay there's a problem here if I'm removing things from the array well let me keep going my thumb and then I'm gonna have to like fix this probably so what I want to do is only put the valid index values in here and then I can skip the ones that are the points of the equilateral triangle that's what I was gonna do this isn't actually gonna work well I'm thinking this through and realizing it's going to work the way that oh don't worry we're gonna get there when we come back let me except why this isn't going to work this was a nice idea because what I was gonna say is so now if I pick the index is this particular element of that array then I could splice it this is gonna cause all sorts of strange and weird problems oh that was kind of fun what would what just happened there index yeah because so I put all the so what I wanted to do is say what I wanted to do up here just bear with me for a second is if a modulus 120 is not equal to zero then it's a valid index I don't want to be able to delete I have a better idea well okay no hold on I got to think this through someone's gonna give me a good idea in the chat probably right we could just mark some points as fixed or something that's probably gonna be better interestingly enough so this isn't going to work why is this not going to work because when I start this is the thing when I start deleting elements of the array then the index values change as the array elements change so while this was like kind of a nice idea like oh let me just put a list of valid things that I can delete once I pick one valid thing to delete then those other things move around and there's I have to like reshuffle all the index guys there's a terrible idea so another thing I could do what's the one thing that's kind of weird that you can do in in JavaScript is that you can attach properties to existing objects so I think this might actually work for me here cuz I have all these vector objects and so let me get rid of this idea of the indices that was an interesting idea I'm how could it get rid of and let me get let me get rid of this here leave just comment this out so what I want to do is with these I'm gonna say I'm just gonna attach a property like active so this this function polar torque at ijen returns a p5 vector object and I could make my own class and make my own object but I'm just going to keep track is this active they're all active to start and then what I'm gonna do is I am going to when I'm drawing them I'm gonna say if V dot active whoops then draw the vertex so this has to go here so as I only draw the active ones so I can instead are actually deleting it I can remove a flag I mean the thing is I was gonna do this in order it would be much easier I was gonna do it randomly probably should just done this order because I could just delete that wanted to talk and then skip the one that I didn't want to delete anyway I don't know why I'm doing it this way now I actually go back to my index thing but I was gonna say I can also say if if angle mod 120 equals zero this is one of the fixed ones so I can also say it's a fixed one this means it can never be deactivated so one thing I could do now and actually this is kind of ridiculous what I'm about to do but I'm just gonna say I'm just going to every time through draw I'm gonna pick a random one I'm going to and I'm gonna say I'm gonna get that vector so circular path index and then I'm gonna say as long as V as long as it's not a fixed one I'm gonna deactivate it now here's the thing ah so this is me doing it randomly I'm leaving all of them there I'm never removing anything from the array and so I'm just deactivating them as long as they're not a fixed one and we should see here now the thing is it's happening in this like weird long amount of time because it still could pick ones so what I could do here now this is kind of ridiculous but I could say what I could do is I could say let active list is a new array every time oh boy I could sure I could do this in a better way but now I could look at everything that's there I could probably use like oh I could use filter I could use filter I won't use it right now but filter is a way of saying like give me a new array by filtering out all the ones that are not active or not fixed that's what I should do so I should say if but I'm gonna just do this a manual way if circle paths are so so here's my vector if it's active and not fixed then is part of the active list and so I can add it to that active list so now I have this I'm rebuilding this AK I can do this because you know it's just like a hundred points I can mess around as much as I want so I'm making this active list and now I'm just gonna pull from the active list and there's no way it can be fixed cuz it couldn't be in there there's no way it could be active so I'm gonna do this and now oops index is not defined sketch line 45 I then whoops so uh skip line 53 I have to make sure as long as as long as there's something there right because when it gets into nothing oh I'm gonna have to put it back oh I gotta put it back maybe I'll leave that as an exercise so let's let me make this let me make this circular path let me make this stroke wait just to let me make the radius 200 and let me make the spacing just two degrees so this will be more interesting it's happening really quite slowly but it that's crazy how it jumps to because the thing is it can like it's deleting all these little subsampled ones and you don't really notice it so I think probably an order to deleting them would make more sense so like for example I mean now this is ridiculous that I did all this stuff just to be able to do it randomly but for example if I just took the first one that right now this is one that Golan has already I believe so now I'm just deleting them one at a time and then I could add them back one at a time so thank you this is yet another example see you can see there's so many possible ways you could think about this I'm gonna be done with this this was another coding challenge I'll leave it as an exercise to put all the points back but you can see these are two possibilities so let me remind you if you go to github.com slash goal on 11 / circle more thing here is where you're going to find many many other ways of doing it so Oh super ellipse formula that would have been a good way treating it as a round and reckon also many better ways than I could have thought of so I did two coding challenges kind of trying to do this triangle two circle morphing I hope that you make some you can tweet them at me hashtag circle morphing at Schiffman you can these the code from my too will be on github and you can and you can what am I talking about I you can link to your own on by if you pull requests on my readme and all of that I plague my new outro music which no but also be out for music afterwards well I hope I hope get a copyright violation for the few sec I got it from a place where it said I was allowed to use it okay thank you thank you goodbye ah all right what time is it now is it 7 o'clock oh it's after 700 I'm gonna have to go yeah look at all these I'm getting all these excellent suggestions about how to do this in a much better way alright so thank you guys what did I so what did I accomplish today I did an arrow about an arrow function a video about the arrow function kind of made a workflow video which I hope helps I did two circle morphing what did I not get to I don't think I can do any more I will be back next Friday and I didn't get to I couldn't get to do any of the array functions I didn't get to do more o P this I realized I've already done so I don't have to do and I didn't get to word to Veck or the Alexis Gill so next week let's see if next week I can get to this this and this that would be a nice goal for next week well I don't know I don't know if this was useful today I will read your simple random numbers promises fiftythree thousand three hundred and ninetyeight sixtyfive thousand five hundred and twenty nine forty seven thousand eight hundred and sixty five thousand 397 387 3d7 this is how much my brain is stopped working that's how much my brain has stopped working I like my new alright thanks everybody I'll see if there's a few more questions in the chat and this was great great thank you good night everybody good night and uh you'll be taking home with you a exciting package of coding train lists of videos I didn't make it to I will answer a few questions from the chat oh it just ended it's so abrupt one more time thank you do I know how to play the ukulele I wish I would totally just play the ukulele on YouTube but not make coding videos which I apparently I think oh that was just the alright alright I think I just have to go so thank you guys for thank you everybody for watching I will be back next Friday hopefully earlier in the day I think things maybe go better if I start earlier in the day everybody should send a tweet to math blank on Twitter and say thank you for figuring out how to edit these things because it's a really challenge because the thing is I don't want to edit stuff out I wanted to have the mess the mess is interesting it's what I think people learn from sometimes what people enjoy and yet nobody can nobody's going to sit through an hourandahalf video so it's it's finding the goodness and keep it that together so yeah now you can everybody could go watch stranger things and how is processing community today thank you for asking processing community day was wonderful I really enjoyed it I think there were many things about the day that work fantastic I think there's many things we could do too if we do the day again to improve the day and the this sort of like aspects of community and our mission to make the day more inclusive and but overall I had a really wonderful time it was a thrill to meet people who were viewers of the channel I did a oh so there will be a video and support that will come out of my live session there it wasn't live streamed but but all the videos and talks from that day will come out at some point and when they do they won't definitely be on this channel but I will mention it and point you all to the channel maybe we'll see I'm processing as a Vimeo channel I'm able to set up YouTube I'm not sure I the meet in real life shirts from processing Community Day I don't think they're for sale I think they were just made I think they were just made just for I think they were made just for the day maybe maybe we could maybe I don't know maybe they can be put online for sale I've no idea all right oh my god I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I I feel like I I would give myself a you know BB for today so I did make this which is nice and oh this cup my coding train mug you you want to know where you could get a coding train bug I couldn't find my yellow mug I lost I left it on a table downstairs hoping I could find it later if you've watched all the way till here you can go to coding train dot store Envy calm and what's weird about this is their only shirts here but if you go down here you can go to coding train mugs and you can actually order one of these two mugs and this one actually as this looks like this good that the coding train mug isn't it nice don't you want one and then this is one that I have it looks like this I can't figure it out anymore there it is all right go home thank you everybody I'm actually going to be an upstate New York flying a drone this weekend for the first time we'll see how that goes all right thank you everybody I'm gonna hit stop I'm glad this didn't crash so really I'm gonna do I I'm really enjoying my you guys should probably probably let me know if it's really annoying because I think it kind of is but it uses me to no end so I'm gonna go one last time I'm gonna be one last time and I am going I'm going to be I'm going to play it one last time thank you thank you everybody this is a wonderful livestream I will see you next week on the coding training bye everybody
