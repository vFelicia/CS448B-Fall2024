good Friday morning hello it is me dan Shipman again on the coding training this train has been very busy this week this is actually my third live stream if you can believe that I have my water here ready with me that will help I'm gonna move it over here though just to get it out of the way so I've been kind of live streaming quite a bit extra this week simply because I missed a few weeks in in the last couple months this will not be a regular occurrence I feel so sleepy I start over let me start over hello it's Friday morning Here I am in New York City live on the coding train the third live stream of this week I will be back hopefully twice next week as well once on Monday let me just quickly mention because if you happen to be in the New York City area you could come to this in person if I go to ITP NYU dot edu slash show this is the information about the ITP winter show which is a twoday exhibition of recent creative interactive projects by the students at ITP it's happening Sunday and Monday on Monday hopefully around 3 p.m. hopefully I'm gonna loud noises coming from the hallway 3 p.m. I'm hoping to do a live stream from my mobile device and walk around and look at some projects so stay tuned for that then I will be doing a obsessiveness all this stuff is important for me to mention I'm going to close all these windows alright so uh so and then I will be back also for on Thursday December 21st I expect this will start around 11 a.m. but I'm not sure about the time yet I will post that soon for the end of year coding train holiday extravaganza fundraiser for the processing foundation so if you haven't made your membership donation to the process Foundation hold off or you can make it now if you want but oh wait and you can do it live and I'll I don't know maybe I'll read the people names as they donate to processing foundation okay if you are so able to so this is a list of some stuff that I want to do today I will be here till about 1245 p.m. Eastern time that's about two hours from now really what I'm attempting to do here in as I approach the end of 2017 is two things one is kind of catch up and wrap up a bunch of things that I wasn't able to get to and I do have this list here for example where's this ah I want this is some stuff from yesterday that I didn't get to that I want to talk about to see if we can do today in terms of WebGL I've been kind of going through the rainbow topics github repository and kind of looking at what things have a lot of thumbs up and see if I can get through like because what I would like to do next Thursday is just only coding challenges so I'm hoping next Thursday will just be a series of coding challenges maybe you can get through three or four and in between I will plug the processing foundation so let me think so what but I have a couple things I want to go over but while I'm waiting what I would be curious for all of you I'm gonna go here and look at so what I did this morning really quickly is I went through the list of challenges and I found some that I thought could be things that I would try to do like image stippling this not challenged looks cool ASCII art generator we're to vet and these some of these are also like topics some more get github topics working with electron so if any of you are if anybody if you want like go and go log on to github you can go to any of you let's say you really want me to try to do image stippling if you click on this link you could add a reaction here so I'm gonna add a reaction here opes no wait I took my reaction away I've had a reaction there and I'm kind of looking at these numbers Roman numeral one asked what do you think about that neural network stuff so that is coming first thing in January 2018 that's as soon as I'm back in 2018 don't know when the first live stream will be time after January first I am going to tackle more machine learning and neural network topics that's what's coming oh my goodness dan dan mr. dan in the chat my name is also mr. dan although I don't know that anyone's ever called me mr. dan is sharing the live stream right now with a group of seventh graders hello seventh graders somewhere at some school watching this oh I have to pick this educational now I was gonna do all my ridiculous wasting time stuff okay so actually while I am doing my ridiculous wasting while I am waiting to get started there's a there's a couple things I want to mention number one is we're project for awesome let's take a look at this this is something that's just started today today is December 15th it is online creators decreasing world can I say suck on YouTube week that out somebody I'm sure it's mine but and I believe this fundraiser is current is from what I understand the current the fundraiser it the donations now at the moment are going to save the children and Partners in Health but a lot of other great charities and I am going to right now well the livestream is not going on but I'm going to donate so this is one thing that I wanted to do I'm going to hit back it let's pick this $60 one why not wait I need to login no wait okay hold on I have an indiegogo account I'm sure hold on hold on everybody hold on there we go I'm gonna you're gonna have to look at this while I enter in my my my credit card details come on boy this is really exciting refitting livestream I swear okay I forgot my password i have an indiegogo account i should have looked at this in advance what's the chance that's gonna work hold on give me one more chance let me need to sign up i will just sign up i'm typing in my email I'm making up a password email has already been taken how about I'm gonna come back and finish this dubnation I don't want to waste your time would be trying to figure out my I should have looked at this in advance but I'm gonna I'm gonna finish my donation later so I will let me just try one okay anyway but uh at the end of the livestream I will complete this I did I changed my tshirt from yesterday but I'm still wearing my same hoodie here okay so let's think about what it is that I'm going to do today ah some other things I wanted to look at two things I wanted to update on one is let me go to p5.js on github because we filed a github issue at the end of yesterday's livestream and let's take a look at it so this was the github issue we filed on yesterday's livestream which is that only in the code currently only woops only what did I click on there only the last light source is active and it should look like this if I have a blue light on the left and a red light on the right and some people took a look and found out that this code like for example here we go this code calling point light multiple times only as a single uniform location so thank you to this particular user here who added some more thoughts and we can see there's a lot of thumbs up and some hearts and so everyone that's follow this github issue and hopefully soon it will get fixed okay so I wanted to highlight that but there's some more information I'd been posted there if anybody wants to take a look at that the other thing I wanted to highlight ah so I released a video this morning about the for of loop so let's go we don't need to watch that video but I wanted to I'm gonna want to look at some of the comments so first of all here's one comment isn't this just for each so yes that is a good point let's see what these replies say works slightly differently for each loop over key value pairs for each loop gives you a callback function that also has an index so a for each loop is actually a sort of more sophisticated set of possibilities and so I liked for of in its simplicity this also note the fort in loop is something that you can use like for of but it loops through keys in an object and I wanted to somebody mentioned something about performance which I don't see here at the moment that I wanted to read I thought seemed like a useful concept looking here ah yes so let's look at this comment here is please keep in mind that these abstract functions have a greater impact on performance for example for of is eighty percent slower than a regular for loop I don't know we'd be interesting to benchmark that to see if that's really true this is something you don't need to take into account always but there are cases where performance is everything so I just wanted to point that out maybe I will pin this comment right now if we think this is oh no I'm not logged in as myself so I have the ability to pin a comment so often if there's a really helpful quick clarification of something that I got wrong or expansion of something that I did sort of missed I can pin that comment to the top so I just wanted to thank everybody for their comments on this video yes so people are complaining that I was trying to type in some really short password I actually the thing is I use one I use a password aggregator I don't know if that's the right password manager that's the right term and all my passwords are 12 characters they're all a combination of letters numbers and symbols I was just thinking well maybe did I ever sometimes I still have these historical old passwords on sites I signed up for a long time ago and so I don't have my one password up so I could look at it up on my phone I I'm not prepared to log into accounts during a live stream for a very specific reason that's definitely something I don't want to do by accident like live streaming something that I'm not important but how that SpaceX launch do any updates on that so anyway I I use one password I'm open to other suggestions for other password managers that's the one that I happen to use okay so let's talk about what it is we're gonna do today so I feel like I would like to start with create graphics if I come over here for a second things that I also could potentially look at is loading a 3d model if anybody has an obj file familyfriendly obj file that like a train or a rainbow or not the teapot you know something that I could use a little cute character for the simple one I would love to make a tutorial that looks at loading one of those files in p5 so anybody in the YouTube chat could share a link and then anybody in that chat could maybe repost that link in a slack Channel I would like to maybe look at begin shape end shape with textures to see how that works because uh thank you Bram in the patron group who sent me some code to help with that and I really want to look at create graphics as a texture and how crea graphics works and then if there's time I might do a straw poll to see if I can get to one of the coding challenges that all that I'm sort of compiling as possibilities for next week so that's my plan ooh train toy 3d model thank you Bram ok so that looks actually pretty great I just want what's the license on that would be the question I'm not in the right view ok you have Jihan asks says I'm ten minutes late what if I missed nothing you missed me attempt to donate to a good cause I'm going to I will finish that donation and maybe tweet a screenshot of my donation to plug it as well later just so you guys keep me honest here I don't want to say I'm gonna donate to something and nothing last pass is also being suggested okay so let's let me start today with looking at create graphics so this is let me go to my usual technique of just going to the desktop and using the p5 manager to generate a bundle I'm gonna call this off I'm gonna call this create growl just call Korea graphics and then oh no that's not Jie is Jen Oh p5 maybe I just say gp5 G yeah that generated a create graphic sketch and then I can run a little server and I can go oh and I'm already doing that because I have stuff open already let's close this oh no don't quit all of terminal oh I'm the worst create graphics let's run my server and let's open this up and Adam oh you know there's a way I should really like I there's kind of some things I like to do to like adjust the template and I should just put those permanently in my p5 manager so let's just make sure I've got a sketch going now create graphics is a function in p5 that allows you to create an offscreen canvas that you can draw and one of the reasons you might want to do this is let's say you have a program you've created sketch you've created where you're kind of drawing a trail but you also want to have something animate on top of that and you're drawing the trail by not erasing the background but the thing that's animating on top of that shouldn't have a trail well you can create two separate kind of rendering contexts and layer them and more than that so I could just do this as a tutorial I think that's what I'm leaning towards and this will probably go in like the additional topics even though that's kind of exploding with the videos but there could be a coding challenge associated with this as well I will be doing a little more in WebGL one of the reasons why I'm doing this is because I want to show you how you can then use a 2d context with create graphics as a texture in a 3d world which I think it's kind of exciting I will be here live deston asks how how long were you plan on this livestream about another hour and 40 minutes I would say so let's make sure let me close all this stuff everybody remind me later say hey did you did you finish your project for awesome donation okay so this is there this is here just gonna quickly see does anybody have does anybody have any suggestions about I think I'm gonna just do a simple drawing program with something that animates on top of it I think that's kind of the most useful way of showing this okay all right Oh fun fun function I just got a YouTube alert teaching programming to children and teachers fun fun form spotlight if you don't watch the fun fun function channel I highly suggest you do it's great check great YouTube channel all right I could draw a pen that's interesting good good good idea Alka okay so let's get started I was trying to do my warmup stretch everybody stretch everybody if you're watching and your treat your computer hunched over like this get up stretch jog and play all right are you loose your body around did now you're ready to program hello this is a tutorial video for p5.js about a particular function a function I really love called crea graphics and I kind of shock that I haven't made this video yet because this is one of the classic things that comes up in every single intro programming graphics course that I've ever taught so let's take a look at that problem so let's say I'm just I just learned to program and I'm making a very simple sketch where what I want to do is I want to say if mouse is pressed draw draw an ellipse at Mouse X mouse Y and make that ellipse 64 pixels in diameter and make that ellipse white with a stroke of white alright so this is a very simple sketch all it's doing is when I press the mouse I'm gonna draw an ellipse now notice that background isn't set up so here's what I'm doing now let's say what I want to do is I want to see it I want to see also something animate over top of this you know an example that of that could be like I want to actually draw something well let's just do that right now what if I wanted to draw Alko suggested this in the chat draw or something where the mouse is so let's let's just have a another circle standin for that pen so I'm gonna make a circle that's a that's a different color and a little bit smaller also at Mouse X mouse why it's always going to be there because and maybe it changes color or something when I click the mouse I don't know but let's okay so I'm gonna put that other circle there oh well that's whoa whoa okay so this is no good because I'm drawing the background and set up everything everything everything across a trail I never erased that background how could I have something that I'm drawing to not erase the background and something that I'm drawing where I do erase the background well great graphics is the answer to this question what create graphics does is it allows you to make this this canvas this thing right here I can make when I say create canvas I've made this what create graphics does is it actually makes another canvas the only thing that's different it's the canvas in the computer's mind you don't see it it's stored in memory so I'm gonna say this I'm gonna say whoops let's call this I don't often call it canvas but let me what's another set of canvas context graphics I'm just gonna call this a graphics and I'm going to say in setup graphics equals create graphics and I'm gonna also make it 400 by 300 now what I'm going to do is whenever I want to draw onto that off screen thing in the computer's mind I'm going to say graphic stock background and if mouse is pressed graphics fill graphics dot stroke graphics dot ellipse so anything that I want to draw to that offscreen canvas that's not the one that I see I can now reference it and again graphics is my madeup variable name this could be kitten canvas kitten graphics whatever it is I've just created this offscreen okay so now let's refresh this whoa what's going on here I don't see it so you have to remember just because you draw something doesn't mean it's there and you see it once you've made this offscreen canvas you have to explicitly add it to the screen so I'm gonna do that now how do I do that I'm going to say image graphics zero zero so the way that you take an offscreen canvas and place it you is with the image function as if it was like a JPEG you loaded it's the same thing it's a rectangle of pixels of some size with some stuff happening in it all right so let's look at this now and we can see look at that so now and now look whoa what's going on so this is the sad truth the sad truth is I've run afoul of the world that we live in today Oh back in the day when I used to program with the snow up to here we didn't have these screens with multiple disel densities and high blah blah blah retina this and high density this there's a little bit of an issue going on which is that I am working with a high density display and so in that case there's actually four pixels for everyone and it's kind of mismatched what's happening in the offscreen buffer the offscreen canvas and that the onscreen one so I'm gonna have to do something just to fix this right now I hope this doesn't happen to you I'm just gonna say pixel density one so I would say hey whatever its kind of screen you're on just ignore that and just have a regular pixel density of one and that should hopefully fix this and you can see it did so you can see now that I have this animating circle and I have the background canvas and there is another way I could have fixed that by the way I could have I've not had a pixel then it becomes a point that image as I draw it why did that not work or I'll have to investigate that alright let me go back to pixels head city one now here's what's interesting so you have to remember I have now drawn something that is a completely time out for a second I'm getting some good suggestions omits set image graphics yeah hold on hold on let's take a look this is a little bit of an aside but Eric in the chat is mentioning an example let's just I was curious to compare I'm gonna come back to what I was doing I just got distracted for a second oops I must have typed in something wrong versa Tillis github dot u slash P five examples OSB OS B whoops ah must be with cursor is there space in this URL yeah it is okay Oh interesting cool so you can see another this is a nice little example that from Eric in the chat okay thanks everybody thanks for bearing with me I just was curious um take a look at that this is great so this is the kind of stuff I imagine people making it what I want to come back to this but let me just investigate this display density thing it frustrated me why did that not work oh I would have to make it double the size mmm that's weird hmm that's interesting oh wait no I'm on pixel density 1 still there we go so that's what I could also do that interesting all right hold on so let me show this I don't know if you can now I don't know if you can see this but I did lose a little bit of quality and in terms of the rendering quality actually you're not gonna see this because this is outputting through HDMI and that is not a highdensity output anyway the point is though if you didn't want to use pixel density one you could actually help shoot everybody hold on let me try this again if you didn't want to use pixel density one because your sin of losing some quality or something that was really important that you're doing you could also not say pixel density one double the number of pixels for the offscreen graphics in other words for the the default canvas is going to be handle for you but now I could double those pixels and then shrink them down when I show them and I think this would then it's the same thing but I've retained it's hard for you to see this I don't know if you can see this see the quality of that particular ellipse let's see if this shows through versus if I say pixel density one and go back to this let me go backwards again and there we go you can can you see the difference there the sort of a little bit of fuzziness but anyway this is not the primary thing that I'm that I thought I want to talk about I want to just look at the fact that create graphics is a way of creating this offscreen offscreen so there's a lot that you could do with this for example let's just let's say I am not actually going to draw this draw with the mouse so I'm gonna have an variable called X and set that to a variable called X and a variable called Y I'm gonna set those to 50/50 I'm going to make a create graphics that's one hundred by hundred I'm going to have the I'm gonna draw the ellipse there and I'm gonna say X plus equals some random number I'm just going to move I'm gonna move X&Y around randomly and let's make this smaller so let's see what happens here and I'm actually also going to add a background to draw so look so now I have that and let's just see just to see what's going on here let's make the background for the graphics object this so you can see that is now that's an offscreen element that I'm drawing onto the screen so there's no reason why I couldn't do something like oh let me draw twice and now I see the same pattern repeating and maybe what I could actually do is say push and a translate you know 200 comma 200 rotate by some angle and draw the image again say pop and I could create an angle variable and now I could say angle plus equals 0.01 whoops angle my iki still does not work and you can see now and let's make that go a little faster and let's say image mode Center and here we go we can see now this that thing that I'm drawing an offscreen canvas is spinning so it's a way of creating there's so many ways we could mix and match these you know I could certainly I could tint it so once it's a separate image there's no reason why I can't manipulate and actually what I'm gonna do in another video which is going to be in a different playlist but I'm gonna look at how I could take a 2d graphics context and make it a texture in a 3d world which will expand on this idea even further so Kelly in the chat is asking is the create graphics context always a rectangle would there be any way to make it polygonal it's not pronounced that word correctly now yes I mean yes and no so by definition an image on the computer is a rectangular grid of pixels there is no other way it can be stored because it is actually just an array of numbers of colors however there's no reason why we couldn't have certain pixels be transparent let me show you what I mean by that what if I actually never okay so first of all let me fix this let me put this somewhere where we can see it that first version of the image let me put it at a 100 comma 100 so we can see this is the sort of plain canvas that I'm drawing on this is the one why not what if I wanted to appear circular well there's no reason why I had to draw that background on it an offscreen canvas will actually begin as fully transparent look what happens now so look at this when it's fully transparent you know it's still rectangular I can't expand off of it but there's I could create the illusion of it being circular so now what I could do is I could have said at the beginning draw an ellipse that's at the middle that has a diameter of 100 and make that ellipse which I gray whoa oops I forgot this is a classic mistake I wanted to make that ellipse gray but I forgot to say graphics dot fill so now it looks like I have this like circular thing and by the way I could there's no reason why I couldn't just move that one around with the mouse so it looks like it's a circular thing you get to behind this one now the thing is it's actually not circular I'm getting lucky but you could see how that thing walked off of that circle so I would probably have to do something one thing I could do there's probably a way that I could I could always keep those edge pixels transparent or I could constrain the motion of that particular lips I mean I'm just like spinning my wheels spinning my gears here just try and random things I'm gonna pause for a second to see if anybody else in the chat has any questions of any features I could add or I'm looking to see if anybody has anything else in the chat they want to mention throw down some clip so Alka mentions that canvas has a clip function so that's something that I would have to implement with htaed of html5 canvas can you use your mouse to draw the same thing twice yeah absolutely so yeah so let's try that so I'm going to mention a couple of these things all right couple notes have come in from the chat that are worth mentioning one is that everything in p5 is wrapping native html5 canvas functionality and there is a clip function that's part of the native html5 canvas so that's something that you could investigate perhaps using as well I haven't looked into that but I will look into that there's all I'm also being told breaking news that I forgot about this that if I wanted to dynamically figure out the scaling the pixel density function I'll show you this if so if I call pixel density with a number this is me specifically setting a pixel density but if I call it without an argument it's actually going to return to me the current pixel density which is one because I said it but if I don't set it and I call it you can see that it's two so this is something that this is something that I could potentially use to this is something that I could potentially use to what am I trying to say this is something I could potentially use to dynamically determine the pixel density and scale the offscreen canvas to read the write the same as the onscreen chemists a ghin that's a little bit of an aside here so let's let's think about this what if I take this one step so it's a bit elastic and could I continue to do the drawing thing so let's actually try to get the drawing thing to work still no I don't want to do that I think this is pretty much all that I want to do here and my live streaming somewhere else no just here I'm trying to think is there anything else I want to add to this hmm I think this is kind of the idea and I think I'll just move to doing the move to doing the hit make like a radar on the green yeah I mean there's so many things I could do I was thinking I could like show I could like stamp it multiple times but I think this is the idea so I'm just gonna I'm going to yes yes yes I won't be FF gaming I I see your comment all right so I'm gonna move on from this example so here's uh here's some exercises for you to try you can if you make of something you can share it in the comments or tweet me at Schiffman but one thing to do could you make a particle system where the elements of the particles the the each particle is actually an offscreen canvas that has some kind of like algorithmic thing happening on it could you create a drawing system where the user gets to draw and then the drawing is shown it tiled in multiple different ways so that I you know what if you used like instead of either just erasing the background or not erasing the background what if you use like an alpha as part of the background so you see these um kind of like fading trails there's a lot of possible things that you could look at it do so I hope you make some more stuff with create graphics in p5 and if you're interested in looking at this same topic but applied in WebGL look for a link in this video's description to that ok thank you goodbye alright deep space void is saying it sort of looks like a random Walker in fact yes this is exactly a random Walker I probably should have mentioned that all right so let's now go towards doing this in WebGL so let me go back to my WebGL example and whoops what do I have here p5 WebGL didn't I make a backup of the WebGL debugging so I guess I let me just start over from scratch here again if anybody has any good ideas for texturing using a well one is hot this is actually the only way at present I think to do text so let's look at that alright so so I'm gonna say p5 G B graphics texture then I'm going to go there and I'm going to open that up I really got to change my template let's get some let's have the video the tutorial actually start with something already like a spinning cube tonight so and I will say rotate X angle rotate Y angle times 1.3 rotate Z angle times 0.7 this is just totally arbitrary box 100 let's add ambient light directional light let's just add a directional light 255 from the top I don't know right or something and that's it let's take a look at this let's run a server and let's see what we've got here whoops directional lights directional light all right that didn't work because it needs to have all three Oh an angle plus equal all right I guess I should so maybe if I add some ambient light that's just like a little bit less bright that's kind of what I was going for and let's actually just have it shine from where where does that's fine and that's Z so let's have it shine from the top so that's actually the bottom all right all right and that's spinning really fast okay so here we are I now have a simple WebGL context let's get rid of the sound library get her this style thing no I refuse to do something sensible like changed my template now before I forget okay so we now have a standard WebGL example and what I'm going to do now have to think about this is I would like to use create graphics as a texture what would be interesting should I just do the random Walker thing again I mean well text is one thing that you have to do this way so I could start with that and then I could maybe even just pull one of my previous examples that's like some kind of algorithmic pattern like a like what the fractal tree or something so maybe I'll grab the fractal tree example and we'll look at that so let me look let me find one of those fractal tree p5.js so basically this example and where is the code for that coding challenge for teen coding challenges number fourteen fractal tree let's get about yes okay great so this is what I'm going to attempt to do alright I think we're good yes any last suggestions all right hello welcome to another fire hold on hello welcome to another WebGL p5.js tutorial in this one I am going to actually don't even have this on my list of stuff but I'm gonna look again at the texture function and previously I looked at how to use an image or a video as a texture in this video I want to look at how to make an offscreen graphics buffer essentially like a 2d canvas that I'm drawing somewhere else how to make that a texture in the 3d world and the way to do that is where the function called create graphics now I should mention I have an another video entirely just about create graphics that'll be linked to in this video's description if you want to go look at that but I'll also explain it in this video so you can just keep watching ok so I'm starting with a very simple WebGL example the only thing for this example is a sort of empty space with a spinning cube and the cube at whoops the code is here there is a single directional light there's an ambient light and I'm kind of rotating this box using the Box function to make this cube so we know that the texture function works and I could timeout for a second let me get the kittens and so let me just add a kitten really quick now we know that the texture function works in a previous video I hope so I also have here unloading like an image of a kitten so just to see that texture works let's add texture and then that kitten is that what I called it kitten yes so if I add that we now see the kitten on the side that same kitten on the side of every of each side of the box now one thing will be an interesting exercise is how would you make a different image on each side you're gonna have to make this a custom shape maybe you make it a bunch of planes maybe use begin shape and shape I'll come back to that another video but right now and we should make the light come from the front actually so I'm gonna have the light come from the front just directly from the front this directional light because I want to be able to see the beautiful bright kittens as they face forward okay so but what I want to do is not have it be an image so a way that I can create create canvas is a function that makes a canvas and I've made a canvas a WebGL 3d rendering canvas but I can also use another function and I'm gonna call it I'm gonna create a very ball I'm just gonna call it graphics and I'm gonna say graphics equals create graphics and now I'm gonna make a square image 200 200 so I'm now making a graphics object that's 200 by 200 and this is something that can be textured to the box so this graphics object it's like a canvas I can texture to the box so let's look now let's refresh now I don't see anything why do I not see anything because when I make a graphics context the first thing it is is just transparent pixels but I can call any of p5 2d drawing functions on that graphics object so I could say graphics dot background and say background 255 and now we see that is there and you know what I could do I could even say graphics dot background and now this is going to flicker so a little flickering warning here and random color you can see this is now just giving it a random background every frame so whatever I would draw on it so for example I could also do something like graphics the ellipse Mouse X Mouse Y Mouse Y 20 and I could say fill oh no graphics dot fill 255 0 255 now watch what this will do look as I move the mouse around I'm kind of drawing on that graphics object and it's still texture to the each side of the cube now what when would you want to do this number one is just what do you want to do something kind of goofy or interesting uh yeah I'm sure you can think of creative uses of this more than I can but here's a reason why you might actually have to use it at present I I don't know that this will always be true but at present the only way to render text in 3d is to actually use that with the text function is to take that place the text on a 2d 2d graphics context and then make that a texture so for example if I wanted to have a message like let love equal I'm gonna make another graphics context graphics equals create I don't love equals create graphics graphics so my kids used to say instead of breakfast breakfast or breakfast and I feel like every time to say graphics I'm saying it wrong let your bleed graphic anyway create graphics no no no I've lost my train of thought haha 300 comma 100 and then I'm going to say love dot fill 255 and I'm going to say love dot textaligncenter and then I'm gonna say love dot text 100 the word love 150 comma 50 so this now should be an a twodimensional graphics context that's 300 by 100 that has the word love in it so first just to like see that this is working let me texture it whoops all right what happened what did I do wrong here create oh you know what hold on a sec interesting whoa okay so one thing that just happened there which I wasn't aware of would happen and let's say love dot text size 64 to make it bigger is that so here we go now one thing you'll notice is again the image a texture a graphics thing is transparent by default so I'm actually just seeing those letters on the side but the rest of that cube is transparent if I had said loved background and I said zero for example this now I don't see that cube is transparent anymore so that's an important thing to notice and I could make it semitransparent like I could say 255 255 255 comma 100 so now it's like semitransparent so there's a lot of possible things I can do here okay but there was an important thing I wanted to mention which is that when I made when I made and I wanted this to be more in the center there we go that's more in the center when I made the graphics context not a square like 300 comma 200 it broke so I'm not sure whether this is a bug in the p5 WebGL at present or whether this is just something that you actually really have to be conscientious of but because what I would have expected it to do was take that image and kind of like squish it onto the onto the side of the cube but it's not doing that at present so something I might have to investigate in the future but what I wanted just like what I was actually thinking is what if I let's just take this out for a second what if I just wanted the tech to appear and almost look flat the way that I would probably do that would be to say texture love plane 300 comma 200 so a plane is a flat surface with a given width and a height so if the text itself is exactly if the if the offscreen canvas is exactly 300 by 200 if I make the plane 300 I 200 it should map directly so let's take a look at that and that also did not work so what's the issue look at this so it looks like the issue is at present p5 WebGL can only take square textures this is a bit of a problem so this to me seems like a bug let's just let's just change this by one pixel yeah broke so that's got to be it now it sort of makes sense but if I used an image that's not a square let's let's I'm kind of off outside of this video now these are is this a square no these aren't perfect squares that's definitely not a square it is 100 by 90 well hold on that's not the one that I was actually using 100 by 98 yes so that's got to be a bug hmm oh we found a bug I'm looking at the chat make it 500 by 500 to test the resize this is a good quick good thing yeah so that was fine all right hold on so to me I feel like this is a bug because I know for a fact that this kitten image was not a perfect square image so there's no reason why p5 can't figure out how to take a non square image and kind of squish it or stretch it onto a non square or a square piece of geometry so but I'm gonna leave that aside maybe sometime by the time you're watching this will be some information in the comments or the video's description about how that's fixed but no matter if all I wanted to do was display text there's no reason why I couldn't just make you know I can for now what I can do is I can make my graphics object and plane and plane object match size I can position the this in the center the way that I want to I can make it have a transparent background and I can say use that as a plane and here we go so whoops what have I done so I need to say text align whoa okay hold on I'm missing a couple things textaligncenter the Creek graphics I wanted it to be 300 by 300 I messed up some stuff oh whoa cuz I changed that this was something I was using previously sorry everybody and now there we go so and by the way if I take this out now I have just text in 3d that appears 2d the reason why I'm showing this to you is because now if I put the rotation back in if I put the lighting back in we can see this is now just appearing like text in 3d which is what I wanted to show you in the first place so this is how you do text in 3d but this could be anything so for example what if I've drawn I'm not sure if I wanted to keep going with this yes three J s is awesome people in the chat are talking about it you should use three J s you should learn it you should use it it's wonderful I just am using this because it's a project I'm working on and it's the thing that I know and I love but yeah if you really want to do robust fully featured 3d that's like high performance at present 3GS is going to be a a better library I mean there's different metrics it might not be a simple of a library it might not have other aspects beyond just 3d but for just pure 3d alright do I want to go on and add the fractal tree thing I'll just make that an exercise right I'll make that an exercise so here's an exercise for you find some interesting 2d animation generative designs for example you could take this fractal tree design that I do a video about where to witch cook the code is over here I'll link to both of these in the video's description can you make this tree a texture in on a 3d piece of 3d geometry what happens if you texture to a sphere a torus a cube that's a good thing so give that a try and see how that goes thanks for watching all right mend your sponge would be cool right oh the mentor sponge in p5.js would be a cool idea okay so I think this is good where are we now 1145 I've got about an hour what else can I do what else can I do today so here's the thing did is there a Shrike try loading and an obj file does anybody have one for me I would love to try this why not right I would I guess I could do both of these but I keep going and just be done with the WebGL stuff let's try loading an obj file train file okay so here's my problem alpha thank you very much oh I'm in the wrong camera thank you very much for that obj file I have to get it onto this computer so is there a from Bram so I need a like just to like a bitly link or something like that that I can download it here real quick art 3d fractal all I should totally do like a 3d tree right alright so if anybody could give me a link to download it yeah I'm sure there's some kind of fancy software I could use to move things from computer to computer actually I have that set up right here because I have this like Dropbox folder for some kind of like I don't know what what account this is logged into hold on buffering coding train live at gmail.com and what am i logged into here alright I'm getting the link oh wait wait wait Ram get got got a link okay great so alright I'm back alright so let me type that in ggee o o GL capital P hi this is better Alka thank you Alka TV slash static slash trained obj okay there we go alright I've got this obj file look at that alright we are going to try this this is very exciting oh I'm so excited alright so I'm gonna I'm gonna be a little smarter about this today and not create as much work for merging and I'm going to just copy this folder call this load model and we'll keep the kittens in there I'm going to go back and go into load model and run the server and open it in Adam and let's get rid of all this stuff let's keep the kitten in there just in case let's keep the angle in there let's keep the lights in there and the box and do I now have a simple example here we go how come it's not oh I forgot angle plus equals zero point 300 three all right okay so here we go I am now going to attempt to replace this with a model of a train so hold on whoops no come on don't aah no no no no no I don't want to copy the name of the file I want to copy the file and I don't actually need the copied file I'll just move it all right okay here we go everybody all right everybody always asks me this so I do this a lot and I'm using command slash to do that I also use this a lot command square bracket to indent or not indent a selection a little tip it for you for everybody and get asked that a lot by the way I'm terrible with this stuff so everybody else has much better ways of doing this stuff okay hello I'm back this oh sorry hello I am back here and again this is never ending but there's so much more to do with WebGL mp5 this video I'm gonna look at this load model and an obj file this is a toy train it is a threedimensional physical actual toy train in what I have already on the computer here is a file that is in the format obj so there are a lot of different file formats for 3d models a 3d model file is a file that has inside of itself all of the geometry all all the vertices all that all the specifications for a threedimensional geometry I thing that's gonna be big system 3 I am totally fired from the coding tree let me just start over again give me give me one ball again for today I think the issue is that I have the sniffles that's not don't litter folks alright hello here we are in this video I'm going to attempt to take this 3dimensional toy train and put it into my computer somehow not really and and the topic here is that I want to this is in my WebGL 3d p5.js serious I want to look at load model so what if I had a file on my computer that had all the geometry for a train in it or anything else so you might know about 3d modeling maybe you use some type of 3d authoring environment to create your own 3d miles models this little piece just fell off um maybe you you go to a website and you found somebody else's 3d model to download but what there are lots of different file formats so that's sort of the question but the file format that you want to look for to import a 3d model into p5 is obj the death blow everybody's years they're really all of a sudden I hope I'm not getting another cold mean it's just an allergy allergy oh I definitely have an allergy to three the third dimension I'm actually this is a very strange thing but I am allergic to the zaxis it's very weird if you don't this about me okay let's go over the computer and see what happens alright so on this computer I already have a file called Train obj thank you Bram for helping me find this file Bram in the patron group I'm gonna I'm actually just look at this file look at this so this was originally made in Rhino that's like a comment and look at all this stuff that's actually what's in a 3d model it's just V all of these vertices these are all the XYZ coordinates so you can make your own geometry algorithmically with primitive 3d shapes or begin shape vertex and shape but here's a file format that has a lot of vertices in and already that's I love looking at that so how do I get that into p5 well I still have a kitten in this let's leave the kitten here just maybe we'll see what happens with that I'm going to make a variable called train and in reload I'm going to say train equals load model so the load model function is just like load image loads image data load JSON loads JSON data load mile model loads a threedimensional model and there's no reason why I couldn't replace now box with drawing that model which is with the function model train oh shoot all right I failed here what went wrong uncaught maximum cost I render GL flatten mmhmm okay so what happened here I'm looking at wonder if the obj file okay I think we might have found a bug in p5 which is that it's possible I'm not so sure yet but it's possible that load model doesn't actually work in in preload let's put this here hold on hold on let me fix this and then go back into the video the it is there I have to go back to an old version this also broke shoot where was my CDN why is this open I mean one of these yeah let's grab this let me get the CDN link to see and let's go check that so I'm just trying now an older we're gonna p5 let's try point 1 4 hmm well oh I'm in their own sketch here oh I did the wrong yeah I did the wrong changed it in the wrong sketch sorry let's try 0.14 there we go oh ok ok so this is working problem importing model ah so there's already a tissue okay great so so that's good but that's the problem let me go back to let me just put it in preload again that's the easiest place to do it yeah ok and so interestingly enough this model is not like the centered around so ok let me just break it real quick so that it's broken okay okay so I've determined what the error was unfortunately at the time of this recording there is an issue let me try and go back okay so I've determined what that error let me get let me open up the github issue github issue processing p5.js what is yeah the model is not centered around zero if you can fix that up and I'll redownload it I'll make that part of the video because that's something that's going to happen to people issue two to six three issues two to six three let's bring this up oh is it is it actually only with large models so would this have worked fine without a with a smaller model okay so they'll mention that all right okay so I have figured out why this broke and unfortunately it broke because that model that I'm loading the train model is actually quite a complex one there's no reason why it can't work and it could it should at some point work there's actually at the time of this recording there is a github issue on the p5.js repo so if you're watching this in the future go and check this maybe it's been resolved but the way that I fixed it right now is I just reverted to an earlier version of p5 the version that I'm now running is 0.5 point one four so let's now have this ready and I'm going to hit refresh there's the Train spinning there's my 3d miles right now interesting enough why is it spinning like a crazy thing let's go and put the box back in let's add the box as well now you can sort of see what's going on the so one thing that's important when you're importing a model is well what is it the models own internal coordinate system and in this case this model that I happen to import it is not centered itself around zero zero and this is going to make it much harder for me to use I could do like some kind of offset I'm like manually like maybe I could figure it out I could say something like right before I draw the model let me translate like maybe negative 200 or like 100 along the xaxis that went that's closer let me try like negative 200 so that got that got further away so maybe it's not that so I could start I could try to debug and figure this out but what instead what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna revise or perhaps Alka Alka has already done this for me Alka in the chat has revised the model to sent around 0 so hold on for a second I'll be right back with a magical new model ok so thank you Alka Alka TV why is it not coming up from your a static train corrected dot obj so I'm gonna grab that train corrected and I'm gonna go to desktop load model I'm gonna put that in there train corrected okay I'm back and I'm going to change I now have a new obj file train corrected we can look at it actually it might be worth just taking a peek at it because we can see look at these numbers now they look more like they're smaller and there's some negative ones so maybe is actually centered around zero zero so let's try this model let's go back and load it we can say okay well that box is still there so the train is now stuck inside the box let's actually let's get rid of the box and let's there we go so there's the train so what should I do now hopefully this is like an open source model often like the source but I'm gonna post this code hopefully now everyone watching can make some goofy like 3d animations with smoke coming out of the train or that sort of thing but let's let's try to just experiment with this a little more so for example what if I just have the ambient light have some color so you can see that this model is going to respond to the light what if I were to give it different material like what if I try specular material that's white right can you see does that look different I can't really tell so did that material apply I don't know let's see normal material let's give it a normal material which is that debug rainbow color yeah so the material normal material is certainly applying it's unclear to me whether the specular one did or it's just hard to see so you can see that that's working and I don't see any reason why I couldn't texture the terrain let's try that oh my goodness it's the kitty cat train all aboard the kitty cat train sorry you know I have to try it some attempt to make these videos more interesting it's mostly failed attempts but so you can see this actually like the p5 somehow decided it would texture this in some arbitrary way so wonderful so I I could do more with this I would love to you know figure out how to make the train move and then have some smoke come out of it maybe the smoke could be spears with cloudy textures or something like that but I'm gonna leave that to you as an exercise now you can see that in addition to making geometry with your Oh making geometry with your own primitive shapes you can also load a model from an obj file and something I still haven't shown you which I do intend to do is how to make a custom piece of geometry using big in shape and n shape thanks very much all right there we go all aboard the pink it kind of looks like kind of looks like rosy baby no all right how are we doing 1205 what could I possibly do all right just to mention I noticing that I'm getting some dm's in the patron slack Channel so that's a fully correct about that's fine I'll add that in hi term I don't I don't look at those it's too much from but so if there's something really important just post it in the live channel okay can you rotate the camera with the mouse absolutely but that might require me to use quarter notes all right so now the question is do I dare attempt to do the custom shape and then I can really feel done with 3d except for shade right also should possibly consider redoing the camera and perspective video but I guess I'll hold off on that I haven't heard from magical editor not you just yet all right so let's take a look let me maybe mm I have about 40 minutes should we try something let's try a little straw poll just see what happens so last thing so I could do custom shape in 3d and then let me go to this is very very dangerous that I'm doing this but I really should just save these for Thursday but curious to see sure your opinion issues assigned assigned to shift man so this is kind of a list of stuff I could do right now we're vac oh maybe I should oh I mean the wrong camera sorry sorry everybody sorry everybody I'm really getting bad at this I used to be just so good at it and I forget all the time do I dare do this alright so here's some things word Tyvek image stippling so if you don't know what image stippling is let's look at it's kind of like doing a pattern of dots to create an image like this I really want to do this at some point I probably should research this before I do it not oh this is a cool suggestion from ruby with you can see these like crazy oh this is 3d huh this would make sense to try to do actually how would I do this in P 5 would it really work I would probably want to do this in processing to make these like crazy nots okay so that's one thing 3d not that would kind of make sense to do since the theme has been WebGL what was the other what else was there electron app oh boy Electra hunap basics and ASCII art generator why did I get hub work I'm not gonna do that more git and github and ASCII art generator I have no idea what I would do to do that let's just see let's see what people are interested in right now here's your straw poll everybody yeah that's one reason why to that I kind of feel like maybe I should save work to back for January cuz its Lee it goes with the machine learning stuff I sort of feel like I should continue with the WebGL 3v autonomous agents boys I didn't like your boys in there use shaders to do all this stuff that's good idea I don't have a lot of time most of these things are gonna take me more than 30 minutes to do I probably shouldn't I don't I think I should do it Sami people are watching right now I should just do the begin shape in yes someday I'll do shaders you want to learn shaders and pull it I mentioned this yesterday look of shaders up it's double crochet yeah so this is a wonderful wonderful stepbystep guide and tutorial with interactive examples my Patricio Gonzales VEVO and Jen lo highly recommend highly recommend this is way better than anything I could ever do that's been a minute and a half get your votes in now just realize that it's quite unlikely I'm actually gonna listen to what you say Oh Oh No did you guys hear that that was the fire alarm but it it went on and then went off immediate like really quickly but there could be no but it wouldn't go on again all right let's see interested whoa really close here this is just this is too close we need a runoff image stippling electron app 3d not I mean I kind of think I kind of think that the electron app I don't know I mean it's not really makes sense to do right now the image stippling I feel like I want to save for next Thursday because that's gonna be that's gonna be awesome but it's kind of like off what we're doing today although it'd be cool to make that image stippling like a texture I feel like I should try the 3d not the question is how would I possibly do that cuz that's actually kind of an easy I think that's probably a pretty easy challenge to do the issue is like well is there any way to render that because you really need like tubes in 3d and I know I'm pretty sure in processing refresh okay fine electron tap wow you guys are really interested in the electron app stuff that is something on my list do before the end of the year that's kind of interesting custom Taurus right I mean yes there's no reason why I can't do my own tube algorithm but that's the whole project unto itself in processing I'm pretty sure you can connect vertices and it will kind of make like a 3d line which is essentially like a tube before you and I don't adjust spinner I don't think so okay so why don't we just do it in processing and I'll come back let's do the not why not where's my laugh track I don't have a laugh track come on I've got to have a laugh track I have an applause track I have a ticktock I don't have a laugh truck for my why not joke alright what about some random numbers alright it's been a while I mean one reason for me to save than all this for Thursday's I want to do a whole set of coding challenges and I want them to be in both processing in p5 so maybe I should just maybe I should just finish nobody wants me oh no custom shape in 3d that got some votes maybe I should just finish the 3d tutorials and this is really helpful for me to see that I could do these all next week how disappointed are you all gonna be yeah by the way first of all I did not see I did not wake up this morning to hundreds and hundreds and thousands of notifications with neutrality means with me and my loving animation I mean ridiculous and uh I did all sorts of ridiculous stuff yesterday go back and look alright it's okay maybe maybe it's just not meant to be I was not meant to be a meme custom shape alright alright 3d knots in the lead alright alright I'm gonna I'm gonna do a run off wasting so much time just thinking about this I can't decide what do I do let's just do a quick run off 3d 3d not in processing finish WebGL in p5 GS tutorials which really means custom shades alright everybody here you go please vote for the custom shapes I will do whatever it turns out to be please vote for the Gustav James I would have vote for the custom shapes it actually shows me the results oh I'm the only person who's voted that's weird Oh cuz you guys are behind me in time okay whoops can I please see the arrow bookmark I don't know what that is what is the arrow bookmark Oh arrow what is that I have no idea oh it's like an image I don't know a guy it's in there by accident it's funny I'm going to delete that go back to whoops uhoh I lost my straw poll here it is all right and now on today's behind door number one is the 3d not in processing which will undoubtedly fail because that's gonna be really complicated behind door number two oh oh oh oh you should do you should pick door number two it's a really exciting tutorial about defusing back in shape and in shape in p5 yes all right I am going to count down ten nine eight seven six five four three two one okay the people have spoken the internet has spoken I must obey the Internet did sad thing is I now have to erase this so oops you didn't even see I didn't even this doesn't work the way that I wanted to I have to erase this because there's there's no doubt that I'm going to have to write do a diagram I don't have time to do this three me not thing this is insane alright so here's the thing everyone should just be prepared for me to run out of time and have not finished this coding challenge and it's possible that if that happens I'll come back later this afternoon but I really do have to finish you know I kind of might have to like five of one I have a thing I want so like I could go a little bit past 1245 it does bring me great happiness and joy to use processing this is very similar to the Lorenz attractor that I made okay all right here we go everybody so not okay good news Ruby already made this in processing wow look at these so cool now I kind of want to look at the code but I'm not going to so oh you know what's so exciting about this I get to open up processing now I'm pretty sure I don't have lips I'm pretty sure I don't have the most recent version of processing so let's just go and download that oh no it's from September I must let's let's see is that really true Simon Says this is the first time I'm using processing since I broke my elbow interesting three point three point six which version did I just download three point okay so I already have the most recent version great so I can clone oh I don't want to close the web browser but I can close terminal and I can close atom and I can get rid of this and I can open up processing like this oh this is so exciting oh I need something like I'm in love music the way I'd hoped alright so let's add some stuff here just to get started let's say knots I barely remember how to do anything in Java okay here we go everybody hello and welcome no good hello I have a very exciting coding challenge for you today I'm going to attempt to make some 3d not now these are 3d knots made in processing by Ruby Ruby who submitted issue number 72 the rainbow topics repository this is related to super shapes or maybe not related but the idea came from after super shapes knots would be a great followup so there's this Wikipedia link and as I often do there is the paul bork website which has tons of mathematical formulas for geometry and i guess i thought back in 2016 i might like to tackle it and i took so long that ruby in fact tackled it herself and you can see these wonderful you can take a look at this github Repub now i haven't actually looked at the code here whatever i affirmed i'm not looked at the code here and but i'm going to certainly look at the paul bork website and i pretty sure that this is going to end up being very similar to another coding challenge where I did the Lorenz attractor so let's take a look so let's see if we can find the simplest way to do this not one not two not three not four but yes five no ha where's my lap drag okay why not do the knots oh this is just this is just getting better with every minute alright so let's look at what let's I want to find the first instance of a formula okay here we go there are a whole family of curves including knots I don't know how well you can read this let's make this a little bigger there are a whole family of curves including knots which are formed by the equations x equals R times cosine of V times cosine of theta y equals R times cosine of feet times sine of theta Z equals R times the sine of feet now I've done this before right didn't I have a video about spherical geometry where this was really really really really similar hmm so this is you I would I would just go back and review that right we can find the points along a 3d sphere by having two different angles and this idea of spherical coordinates and you using spherical coordinates so what this is is probably weaving a path around that sphere is going to end up with some interesting knock patterns so for example we could do it this way whoa so which are the equation sprite for converting from polar to Cartesian purple coordinates that we make them our theta fee a function of the parameter beta which ranges from 0 to PI ah look at this oh I love this okay okay so so first we just let's get these formulas let's grab this formula and let's put this in our coach so I have a blank sketch here I'm doing this in processing which has a robust 3d rendering environment P 3d I've been doing recently a lot of video tutorials about WebGL in P 5gs so maybe I'll try to redo this one so let's put these formulas in here and put them up here in just in the comments now let's get these formulas and put them here as well so this is really I believe all that I need so first I'm gonna have a variable let's just do the whole thing all at once so we can animate it have it grow we'll figure out that stuff as we go but first let me just try to draw the entire not so I need to have a variable I'm gonna call it beta which equals zero and I'm going to say while beta is less than PI right isn't that what it said zero to PI that's the range the first thing I'm gonna do is these so I'm going to say convert these now I'm going to say float R equals this formula float theta equals it can someone in the chat confirm that I'm pronouncing the Greek letter fee correctly I know some people say five but I think it's actually fee so great I'm gonna add my semicolons so now I have calculated and are a theta and a fee so once and this should say cap pie has to be all capital letters for the constant now what I'm gonna do now is take these now I'm actually in some ways done I have the polar the spherical coordinates for this knot pattern but what I need to do is that P processing only knows about Cartesian coordinates X Y Z so that's what this next step is whoops so I need to get these formulas and I can say float X float Y and float Z and just make sure I put in my semicolons and then let's just I was gonna let's use well what let's just go for broke here I want to well one thing is I need beta to increase so I'm gonna say beta plus equals zero point one and I'm just gonna say begin shape and shape it's this gonna work I'm gonna say no fill stroke 255 and I'm just gonna set a vertex vertex at XYZ oops let's run this what did I get is there anything there well first of all I forget the origin point is the top left corner in processing so let's translate to the middle and let's run this again I'm hoping to see just look there's something there's my knot pattern look oh it's beautiful look at the not matter so what happened I'm getting values and it's making some pattern but those values are probably really really tiny so I need to do is really expand it out I couldn't use scale or something but let's actually just try I have a feeling that if I just take our and kind of multiply that whole our our being that radius by like something like 100 I'm going to see something more looking like they're not there we go look at that that kind of looks like it now it's very jagged so I probably need finer detail so let's increase beta by less let's just try like 0.01 so now I actually have like a hundred points for every I don't know ten points for every one point I had before there we go now we're definitely talking now is this really 3d I believe it is but let's confirm that by let's have an angle and let's just do a little bit of rotation like rotate Y by that angle and increase the angle by some small amount there we go so you can see and that's going really fast so let's slow that down it could map it to the mouse or something so you can see there is the not so first of all boom done we may have this not and now there's just so much that we could do let's try adjusting the formulas a little bit so let's try top side front yes not five so this are some oh look there's even some source code here that I could have copied so I'm heat not whoa look at this there's all these different possibilities so actually so what I'm going to do as an exercise I'm gonna let people explore who I really would like to do this one I'm gonna let people explore and try to make other versions of these knots and let's just try what I want to do is show you a little bit more about different ways you could render the not so one thing that I think is worth looking at is how could I have that not animate its path well first of all how could I make it can I say strokeweight in 3d will that make that cuz a stroke in 3d is really like a tube let's see let's see how that looks yeah so that made it a little thicker I think if I say eight all right so this is worth doing I could also probably mess around with the color so I could say like stroke XYZ or something and it's gonna give me like an RGB value according to its XYZ value this is just like normal material in p5 so you can see it start to play with the colors of the pattern but what I really want to do and let me sort of feel like doing this actually so the R could be the Jeep so let's just do this weather so if we see the difference what I really want to do now is I want to show you how to animate this pattern how do we do that so the way that we do that is instead of drawing all of the vertices all at once what if I store them all into an array and then and then create the shape one at a time so there's there's a variety of ways I could do this what I'm actually gonna do is I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use an ArrayList and call on with Poppy vector RP vector is a kind of object that stores an XYZ and I'm gonna say vectors equals a new ArrayList P vector and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna now make beta a global variable and instead of while beta is less than PI I'm just going to every let me take all this out I mean I'm gonna need this stuff I'm gonna I'm gonna move actually what would make more sense is I want to what I want to do let me take out the while I want to put all the drawing stuff separate so the drawing stuff is going to happen down here and it's still going to involve a loop so I want to say ever vector inside of vectors set of vertex at V X V Y V Z so this is now just this is now just saying hey draw all the vectors as a shape so now what my job becomes is adding these points one at a time so every time through draw beta goes up by a little bit and what I do is I say vectors and I think it's ad in Java and ArrayList add new P vector at that XYZ so I got rid of my loop and I'm just calculating one XYZ every frame and adding it and what this should do is if I run this I should see it drawing that path this is pretty good now ah so I forgot um one thing is I lost the color so I could do something where I you know calculate make an object for a vertex that has the color and the XYZ so I could there's probably a lot of ways I could think about organizing this right now I think what I might just do is set the stroke here and one thing I could do is I mean this is redundant but uh so this is very inefficient but I can ask for the oh I could just say I could ask for the magnitude for example of the vector that's its length and I could say something like whoops I could say stroke 255 magnitude 255 so the length of the vector right how far it is from the center has something to do with its color so you can see now against again I've kind of got that coloring back in oh this is so lovely well this actually worked out quite well so I think I'm going to stop here and quit while I'm ahead so to speak there's probably a lot of things you could think about doing you could look at Ruby's code which I think we'll have more examples can you create any of these other patterns can you think of other ways of rendering them could you make some nice gif animations so if you may something share it there's three ways you can share well there's a link to the source code for this challenge in the description there's a readme there so you can add a link to that readme you can tweet me at Schiffman or just use hashtag than why not why k and ot hashtag why not and I on Twitter I'm at Schiffman and I'd love to see all the different beautiful knots you make and at someone I will look into remaking this in p5.js okay thanks for watching this coding challenge have a good day okay that was shockingly I didn't even I didn't even use the whiteboard I think I have time for the custom shapes I totally have time for the custom shapes we're gonna do the custom shapes I mean I know I should read random numbers but I totally have time for the custom shapes quick quick quick quick everybody let's do the load model one because that basically had what I wanted and I totally do not have time for this but I'm gonna try kittens I need the kittens I need the kittens kittens must come with me everywhere custom shapes okay okay I'm great so here we are this drives me crazy for no good reason and let's minimize this let me find but I will not forget about donating to project awesome I think I'm gonna just do that for my when I log out of this view of the computer and log back into the other one and I will tweet and I'm just looking at this okay alright and which version of the p5 library is this hold on I just have to check something no so we might run into a huh all right we're gonna give this a try alright everybody works on both versions okay thank you thank you for testing that for me all right I'm gonna try to hurry this up here does it make me so happy if I get this kind of done okay I've got another webgl in p5 video for you and in this one instead of drawing all I erased everything on the whiteboard that's fine I don't need to go over there in my list instead of drawing a primitive shaped like a cube a sphere a torus a cone etc I am going to make my own shape with begin shape and end shape so let's look at how that works so this has a box with a kitten as the texture when I've done I want to see just a custom shape also with the kitten as a texture let's see if we can make this work okay so let's take out the box let's take out the texture just for now and let's say normal material hopefully this is going to work now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say begin shape and and shape and I have another video tutorial just about how begin shape and shape and vertex works and you can go refer to that one once you're into the 3d world there's a lot of possibilities we could tile with triangle strips and do all sorts of different things but I'm gonna just make a single shape that has that has vertices and it's like a basically like a quad I'm gonna make a quad so I'm gonna say vertex just to start 00 vertex 100 comma zero vertex 100 comma 100 vertex zero comma 100 and I think an important thing that I need to have here is close so what am i doing I have 0 0 100 comma 0 100 comma 100 zero comma 100 so I this is my path and all of a sudden out the clothes parameter in end shape makes the last vertex connect to the first vertex okay so let's see this is the equivalent of doing plain right this is like doing plain but I'm doing it with begin shape and in shape alright I don't see anything let's try fill there we go alright so normal material didn't work but that's fine fill works can I get ambient material to work no hmm Oh p5 so I'm gonna have to investigate those bugs so those seem like they might be bugs right now I'll have to investigate those who come back in this video or write something in the description but I really wanted to show you something about texturing and first of all let me just put Phil back the thing that I want to show you that's important is once I have these custom vertices I can start to really do weird things like for example what if this last vertex over here you know was a little bit more to the right I now have this kind of quad that's not a standard square and also like maybe I want to it's a sort of like Center itself so right now I could say just really quickly I mean I could redo all these vertices but I'm just gonna translate by like negative 50 comma zero and so now I kind of have this quad moving around at the center a bit more so let me put this back and we can see this is just like plain negative 50 I'm sorry negative 50 comma negative 50 it should be okay so now this is just like plain I have lighting in here already so that's why the ambient materials should have shown up because I have lighting already okay so time after the Alka it seemed like everything in p5 web gels broken so first of all everything in p5 WebGL has pretty much been broken always people have WebGL is a totally new piece of p5 totally new and it's been around for a year or so but it's been worked on completely redone over the summer so I think it hasn't gotten a lot of use which is one of the reasons why I'm making these videos is to find a lot of these bugs so hopefully and things just maybe haven't also had just haven't been implemented yet all right who get distracted by chat I can't not be distracted by the chat all right all right so now what I want to do is texture this geometry so what's interesting about this is let's just say I add right now texture oops I'm going to take texture kitten instead of film interesting website I don't see it why now something's happening but I don't see the kitten why not so this is what's really interesting about working with textures and custom shapes a vertex is defined by its X Y point or really in this case X Y Z that's what this is this is really zero zero zero 100 zero zero right I just sort of ignoring the Z but I probably put that in there if I want to take image data like a JPEG or a PNG or whatever and basically place that image data inside of that polygon the thing that I'm defining I need to say hey zero zero goes with what pixel this pixel 100 zero goes with what pixel this pixel now this would be kind of like a literal mapping of saying like this image gets mapped exactly on to it but what you see about this is you can start to do a lot of different things I will also refer you to a video about a flag simulation that I also have that does the same exact thing but with a more complex geometry so for the vertex function instead of just X Y Z I can also have u V the U and V coordinates are the pixel mappings on the image and I believe in p5 by default these are normalized so there are different ways this can be done but what I mean by normalized is this is actually 0 0 this is 1 0 this is 1 1 and this is 0 comma 1 even if this is a 640 by 480 image so basically so let's look at how that works I'm gonna come back over here oops thank you thank you thank you and let that sound at that finish I'm gonna come back over here and let's start adding those UV coordinates in so I think this should be so let me add the zero in because I have a feeling it might not it's probably not gonna figure it out properly without the zero so I'm going to now say this is 0 0 this is 1 comma 0 this is 1 comma 1 UV and this is 0 comma 1 so let's try that there we go there's the cat on our custom shape now it's so dark let's just pump up the ambient light here all right so I just wanted to add ambient more ambient light so we could see it now here's the thing that's interesting these mapping you now have a lot of creative possibilities like for example what if I just took out this point right what if I put this what if I made this a triangle and kind of moved this point to 50 comma 50 so let's try that so this lap this vertex is actually going to be 50 comma 50 and we should see look and you can see how it's sort of trying to figure out as best as it can how to kind of squish the kitten in and probably in this case just this rotation stuff is more trouble than it's worth you can see this is what it's done how it's decided to try to smush the kitten into that geometry and this of course could move like I could say Mouse X Mouse Y which is going to produce a really weird results but you can see this is me kind of like stretching so you could imagine you could have an algorithm that's changing the geometry I could have many many more points there's so many possibilities here another thing that I might that I'd love to show that I think's worth showing is what if I reverse so take a look at this kitten see that kitten it's looking that direction what if I flip the pixels and say this pixel should go with one comma zero and this should go with zero comma zero this should go 0 comma 1 and this should go with 1 comma 1 now the kittens look in the other direction what if I didn't flip the bottom I'm good no kittens will be harmed turning this like now that's something weird crazy happen because the top was flipped and had to like twist it to get the bottom so and these can be variables right this could be these could be variables that are changing and oscillating I could you know if I go all the way back whoops let me get that let me get our kitten back there I could do something like I actually only want to see the top half of the kitten so the Y or both 0.5 now that's the top half stretched into this stretch into this shape so there's a lot of I'm really just scratching the surface here but as you start to make your own shapes you can texture them and assign different pixels of different images and different parts of an image to different vertices of that sounds of that shape all right so hopefully this was helpful hold on my cap would ready yeah you know there's still again after the time of this recording there seem to be some bugs with how custom shapes work in p5 WebGL hopefully any of you watching like decide to file a bug or look into fixing a bug in a friendly and supportive way and hopefully and please tag me at Schiffman on github if you post an issue related to this video or of course you can also ask at forum processing org in the p5.js category if you have kind of questions about how this stuff works so thank you very much and I look forward to seeing your custom geometry with textures in P 5gs alright everybody all right I'm looking at the chat okay oh boy all right hopefully that was helpful so what do we have left a few random numbers a few questions quad and triangle strips let's see here let's find the so someone named coding train random numbers no shoot oh yeah I think this is the channel this is a totally different YouTube channel which I feel totally happy for it to exist wait a sec here let's make sure this is legit here okay that's fine that's actually mine so um so that's very nice of you coding train random numbers to include a link of but you should just be clear I think because whoops anyway that's the patreon for the official coding train Channel but that's a small detail here okay so 0 1 2 3 that's the last one so this is where I last left off oh this was me yesterday with my net neutrality protest but hold on but did this really end the introduction well I only read the first two paragraphs of the introduction what whoops no no don't watch that nobody hold on okay so I don't know should I read the introduction or not random numbers audio book do the introduction now just get to the random numbers decide later all right here we go I've got another straw poll for everybody here the question is should I be just reading the random numbers you should play the video of you playing the video of you playing this to you should I be reaped you should I just go for the random numbers cuz I got it there's a lot of random numbers for me to get through or is that just am I missing something I should really make sure I read all the introduction which by the way has a lot of numbers in it also before I get to the random numbers this is how I'm going to decide everything in my entire life from now fine I'll walk around tweeting out straw polls that audio oh the audios bad is it is it just the music or something hold on one thing is that I have done something to my setup here to be more sophisticated which is that I can actually monitor the audio hello so it sounds so k sounds okay to me so interestingly enough if if that second time I play the music just now still had an audio glitch the glitch is happening somewhere else because it in my monitor it sounds fine alright still ok so I'm not I'm done with the sound board you're probably like unplug plug it back in change the wires I'm just not gonna worry about that all right let's view the results just get to the random oh this is very close come on folks I can't decide how is it that there's like four people watching but only 26 people actually voted I think there's only like 30 people really paying attention yeah the streaming cable mmhmm could be oh you know what it is no because I'm listening to the monitor so weird ok I have to go I have one minute everybody wants me just to read the random numbers let's do some more net neutrality protesting every time I'm just going to read one line from the random members block thirtyseven thousand five hundred forty two four thousand eight hundred and five sixty four thousand eight hundred ninety four seventy four thousand two hundred ninety six twenty four thousand eight hundred five twenty four thousand thirty seven twenty thousand 636 ten thousand four hundred and two 822 wow that's like a low random number ninety one thousand six hundred and sixty five alright thank you and good night everybody this has been the coding train I will be back next I will be back next Thursday for a day of coding challenges with a fundraiser for the processing foundation and I will also hopefully be back on Monday with a live stream from the ITP show showing you a lot of the students great work over the course of the semester alright so I'm gonna go so I'm looking I'm seeing that someone wants me to talk about frustum culling and I've seen that message of the chat zillion times purple X what was it that you wanted me to respond to try to answer just one or two questions in the next one or two minutes oh yeah I should make the custom shapes 3d like a pyramid or something that would make more sense to late purple X you should make a game and let everyone play it that would be a wonderful thing to try to do sometime yeah so I've meetings and things and other things for the rest of the day we're getting set up here for the ITP winter show if you're in the New York City area come by and say hello and hope everybody has a wonderful weekend I have so many videos now to release so okay so so I'm gonna go so thank you everybody I can't play like a goodbye song or anything I don't know do something nice for somebody in the world this weekend give somebody a hug go outside make sure you get some exercise some physical activity in whatever way that that works for you and I will see everybody stay warm if you're in New York City it's very cold and I'll see you all on Monday I'll play thanks everybody I don't know what time it's gonna be but my guess would be the earliest would be 2 p.m. and the latest would be 4 p.m. I'm going to start and that's Eastern Time room starts somewhere in there and I'll try to tweet out a time follow me on Twitter at Schiffman ok I will sing think for you frustum calling tutorials in OpenGL or WebGL please please please please please please please please please please please this is me doing a dramatic singing of the comments I'm getting ok goodbye yep elbows doing pretty well this is my range of motion can you tell which one was broken now you can probably tell which one was broken but I'm still stretching still working on it alright byebye everybody yeah I know I'm late ok
