do oh hmm good morning sound check one two three starting in just about 35 seconds good morning and welcome to the coding train with your host dan who seems to be sort of sitting in the dark i don't guess i don't usually stream this early and if i do maybe the last time i did it the sun was not out and so you can see the sun is coming in and shining behind me i do have these two lights pointed straight at my face but nonetheless oh now it seems to have come around and i can see myself in my monitor over here this is why i always look over here because i have this monitor over here where i should be looking at you the viewers the people of the internet um thank you for joining me this morning i i don't know i don't i don't know how this is gonna go i don't have two i actually do have a plan not to say i don't have a plan but i do have a plan um this is probably the last live stream of the summer um never say never but i will be back in full force in september i am teaching um two multiple classes at nyu this fall and i have a lot of content i hoped and planned to make for those courses um but um so this is my last little just like hurrah here for the summer um i do have some other videos that will be coming out um you know that i'm doing some of you might be uh i've followed the fact that i'm doing a guest conductor series i've got a couple more of those planned um i also have another coding in the cabana video planned um first of all i just want to say good morning to rose because i saw in the chat very briefly that rose woke up at 5am to watch this stream and i'm so so sorry hopefully this goes well it is interesting and you uh enjoy yourself learn something maybe just have it on the background and because you're got lots of other things to do that's totally fine but thank you for tuning in um i know that it's a bunch of people it's the evening for them um but it's it's it's uh it's it's not that early to be honest it's it's it's eight and usually this wouldn't be early for me i'm an early riser lots to do but this whole quarantine situation i scheduled just gotten pushed back and back and back my sleep is all messed up if i had known how it's gonna feel this morning i would not have scheduled this live stream yesterday but once i schedule it it's scheduled so my kids are still sleeping because we're on such a late schedule although they do very shortly have an online chess class that they're taking which is why at nine o'clock which is why i am here was able to sort of work out to stream this morning i hope to be done around 10 is the plan you know how i always go late but i don't get all day people got lots of stuff to do um yeah so how are you i hope you're well um so let's let me let me sort of set the stage here set the table if you will um i have been doing so if you've never tuned in before this is the coding train um i do have a new sponsor for the coding train today which i will briefly just mention oh wait i have to go here and then i have to go here and then there it is notion i'm waking up people i'm actually excited to talk to you about notion um notion is a whoops all my things in the wrong place is a is um productivity software uh that breaks the mold by combining all essential work tools so i'll come back and talk to you a little bit more about notion uh later i have i'm slightly allergic to project management systems that i tend to just email myself things to do but i've been working with notion um and and actually quite enjoying it so you can check it out at um what was it again oh i'm fired i'm so fired bit.lee notion coding train you can get a free uh personal plans they used to be five dollars a month but now you can get a personal plan for free um so go check that out i will come back and um talk a little more about that later um let's see so okay so also it's i i don't know what the temperature is outside i do have the one of these old oldtimey oldfashioned um thermometers downstairs um and i seem to have just gotten a new member because these lights behind me are blinking oh i'm so in the dark what is going on daniel garden has joined wait i can't i'm all over the place here oh where's my bell and my random number book and my music cube daniel garden uh really you should be a member of the coding garden with a name like daniel garden but thank you very much for joining i'm just about there you have won with your membership to the coding train a person sitting in the dark in the morning it's so bright in here and so hot what i was gonna say is it's like i turn the air conditioning off so it makes a loud noise but i think i need to turn it back on so there will be a little bit of a hum in the background for this live stream and here's your random number daniel 79 454. thank you okay um oh daniel garden is a moderator on the coding garden excellent um uh thank you pedro it's not going very well it's not going well do you think it's going well i don't think it's going well okay i'm turning the air conditioner back on cold for comedy there's no comedy here that's by the way one of the um one of the most frequently commented comments on my uh videos is i don't know why you think you're funny you're not funny like i never said i was funny not funny not funny not funny not funny okay um now come on wake get into the light camera adjust your white balance thingy whatever now the sun will rise it will keep going this way you know that way is that way it's north so that way it's east sunrises in the east right so it's going to go like this let's see yes marcos thank you [Laughter] marcos is after my heart with his quote of acting thank you um and let's go here uh oh my goodness my stream deck is bugging out all right so i was setting the table the fork i don't know where the does anybody know how to set the table i don't i just put the forks and the plates and the cups remember how coating train used to be brought to you by water those are the days i had a recording studio i didn't have all this hair i was in the light i didn't know this would happen the sun is really uh messing with me so um what i've been doing with these summer live streams which i actually really quite enjoy is just working on random stuff i worked on a discord bot did train some machine learning text generation models we tried playing around with my hue lights uh tried the youtube api i had a whole list i don't know where that list went i mean i know where it went but i erased it so um but uh today this morning there are a few kind of random things i want to work on one is and let me just bring this up here fork and knife to the right says frank spoon to the left thank you very much then you put like the salad fork does it go like on the top no that's the soup spoon so one of the things i definitely want to do i'm really excited about this is if i come back to the most recent guest conductor video with guest artist chrissy brimmage who helped us learn uh who taught me and whoever tuned in blender the basics of blender i'm just looking and made this like beautiful um model of mew i made my own model of mew which i will show you which i'm naming mewtwo and i want to try importing my model of mewtwo into processing and see what i can do with that um let's take a look by the way at twitter.com and let's take a look at mewtrain because mutrain is the hashtag for everybody to post their blender models that they um so if you didn't tune in to that stream go usually i don't tell anyone to go back and watch something because you know please don't don't but uh chrissy is amazing and that stream was mindblowing to me and you should definitely go back and watch it and make your own uh 3d model in blender if you've never done that before um you can see this is my isn't it beautiful oh mewtwo you are you are my love um vadim made this incredible um mew which i don't even understand there's like shadow and a floor and there's like a ball over here and look at these eyes just gorgeous um this is um tweet great detailed explanation colby's mew marcos says look at that with the rainbow little i like the arms like i'm a trex um but with the rainbow there is amazing um this is the coding trains tweet this is uh chrissy's oh so you know if you if you're not familiar with chrissy's artwork this is a reel of her artwork it's fantastic uh soarin from denmark followed along and i um this was so interesting to me like i never occurred to me that that you might like place a reference image in 3d space it's almost like you're tracing an image or painting by numbers or um and that was really mindblowing to me it's super fun it's i can tell immediately that it's like a thing that i'm not gonna be very good at like i have trouble with um it's almost like like mechanical analog physical things in the world i have trouble putting them together let's just put it that way but interestingly enough like in software and coding is the thing that i it's not that i find it easy but it's something that i uh that fits with the way that i think and work and blender 3d modeling seems to be somewhere in between because there's a bit of like manual dexterity and sort of artisticness to how you sort of and you can see where what i ended up with here but i i actually really i really love mine youtube have i lost all my viewers left let yet oh we can't talk all right so that's uh item number one is um playing around with mewtwo in processing very excited about that and um now item number two if i go to thecodingtrain.com my most recent coding in the cabana video i don't know why everyone's telling me it's lina gomez's birthday i've seen this in both the discord chat and the youtube chat i made a video about marching squares so i would like to look at community contributions to marching squares if you made your own marching squares uh variation you can maybe possibly still get that in right now and a couple people in the chat asked about the interpolation step so i'd like to go over that code because it's not it's not something i went over in the video but it makes quite a difference in the quality of the visuals that you get so that's probably actually where i'm gonna start i'm gonna start with the marching squares and then work on the mewtwo stuff the things that i won't get to but i would like to are thinking about marching cubes like how would i take the marching squares into 3d so in marching squares let me pull up a little diagram here that i know is on the wikipedia page all right where's my video people should come up maybe it hasn't been around long enough um this is the diagram i'm looking at so looking for so with marching squares there are 16 configurations because there are four corners to a square if each corner has two possibilities that's two to the fourth power or 16. marching cubes let's see if there's a similar diagram somewhere that i can find here we go 15 oh the originally published 15 but i was going to say there's got to be 256. what is going on here this is wacko wait anyway i have not looked at this in advance but i was going to assume that with a cube given that our there are eight corners and each one could have a zero or a one that there would be two hundred two to the eighth power which if i'm correct is 256 possibilities and i believe there are techniques and strategies probably for creating some kind of like lookup table for based on the configuration which which uh polygon should be drawn uh and there's a cool of course there's a video from sebastian lag about marching cubes um which uh i guess we could all watch it together but um there are only 15 unique possibilities i don't understand that oh because you could rotate it maybe with rotations i see that's interesting so there must be some way um there's yes there's 256 but each but there are probably each variation can be a rotated version of another one that must make sense it's written 256 possibilities look at the text beside this image the algorithm proceeds through the scalar field taking eight neighbor locations at a time determining the polygons needed to represent the part of the iso surface that passes through this queue okay this is done by creating an index to a precalculated array of 256 possible polygon configurations yeah by treating each of the eight scalar values as a bit in an 8bit integer so how do i create that array of 256 possible polygon configurations is that a thing that i could just pull out of a json file like that would be cool right someone's got must have made one because if that were the case i feel like i could do this rather quickly json file marching cubes configuration uh lookup table like lookup table maybe configuration is wrong by the way can i just make a random plug i never i'm never able to um use google in search engines the same way after reading this book um algorithms of oppression by dr safiya um noble fantastic book highly recommended i'm part of a book club right now that's reading it and discussing it it's fantastic uh okay ah original marching cubes look up table i just want like a data file that has like all of the vertices for me uh that i can just maybe that's the thing i should make how to construct the marching cubes table algorithmically why would you want to do this well of course i want to do this don't ask me why um okay so simon thanks thankfully simon is watching this morning because i know i can get i could use google or i could just ask simon there are 256 possibilities but there are only uh 15 unique ones the others are just rotations and reflections you can just download the list off the interwebs yes but where i need a url or or better yet i need some keywords to type in to this search engine here to find that for me but that's not what i'm doing right now oh paul bork oh my gosh first of all speaking of amazing things to plug i have used this website basically my entire life as a programmer i think i started using this website probably in as early as 2001. you can see this is an article from me 1994. just about i mean i you know i could skip my whole way i could just basically use paul bork's site as entire means for looking for all of my coding challenges i probably referenced it a bunch of times there's so much amazing stuff in here highly recommend um an alternative table oh look at this look at this this is what i'm looking for the following code was generated from the above here is a table 256 and 13 points so what do those 13 i need i don't have my white board set up shoot i didn't think i would need it today but clearly if i'm going to talk about marching cubes i really really need that whiteboard uh sebastian lag has a link to a list all right let's see sebastian lag marching cubes uh look in here um project files oh look at this so there's that link that i was just looking at let's see what these two are and let's take a look at this one generating complex procedural trains okay marching cubes right right here's the 15 configurations a lookup table okay i i should this is actually could just this this could be a i could make a followup coding in the cabana there's enough here that i could do that i don't know that it makes sense for me to really get to try to do this today or i could when i can get back to i know a couple of you in the chat mentioned i missed the coding challenges and i agree um this would be a good sort of coding challenge video this is the paper that i've already read and this is the github page so i wonder if in here there is like somewhere in here the lookup table scripts boy wow amazing i guess this is what happens when you code in unity um all right so that's great that i found that let me put that aside so we have mewtwo loading into processing marching squares looking at community variations and um talking about the interpolation step we have trying to code marching cubes not gonna happen and then what i am what i was planning to do as my next coding in the cabana video is uh fractal flame so fractal flame um and i want to look for the original paper here it is um where's the pdf um let's see maybe that will show up if i just put pdf here yeah that's here we go yeah this is what i'm looking for so uh here's the url if you want to take a look at this yourself so um this is a particular algorithm invented by scott draves and a collaborator eric recase um and if you go to my uh twitter which is twitter.com shiffman am i still in the dark you can see the sun is moving um we'll see here oh first of all uh james schloss from i don't know how to say this lee ios lee leo is also working on fractal flame we've been messaging about this um you can see these are results that i've gotten with some of my early experiments but i'm not entirely sure that i'm doing it correctly but what i've been reading i read over this paper and i'd be happy to start walking through some of the code even in today's live stream because i do want to make a video kind of coding this thing from you know all the way from nothing to the end um but this paper describes it really quite well there's a lot of math notation which can be a little bit intimidating and tricky but the thing that's always helped me is going to these um pseudo code little spots which really do explain um which are very helpful to me and sort of like figuring out how to write the code for it um and so um and then there's all these different uh uh transformation uh functions where you just take an x y and so like this is just making a copy of the x y this is taking the x y and giving you back sine of x sine of y so these are these are things that um that looks a little scary but are actually quite um quite not easy but are quite transferable into code um but what i wanted to ask about if anyone's going to look at this uh later and maybe want to engage with me on twitter to help is i don't what i really don't understand is like i've got my images uh look without a lot of the extra sort of like blurring and fancy work with coloring that i think i'm missing my images look kind of like this so i think i'm on the right track however what i really don't understand is how these images are are were created because i mean i don't want to get too far into the weeds with this basically there it's a threestep process you apply a transformation uh then one of these variations and then another trans linear transformation and one of these variations and another linear transformation and i can't and i get sort of like all sorts of wacky fun results when i'm sort of throwing all the spaghetti at the wall but this i feel like i must be missing something because this these particular examples are showing i can't reproduce these so that i would if that is something that i would love some help with if you want to look at my code so far to compare with the paper um if you go to github.com codingtrain um and i think if i go under repositories it's probably the most recent one fractal flame right here so we can see and i'll just show this to you by the way like so just look you'll see i mean i've done this in a sort of awkward way but but um you can see so i what the way that i have this is i have this idea of a ver um a class called variation and it keeps track of its name and some color information and these coefficients for these transformation steps but then every single one of these variations like if we look at spherical v2 of x x the function which gets as input x y returns 1 divided by r squared which is the magnitude of the vector x y times x y if we go back to my code and i look for spherical you can see this is what i'm just doing exactly that but with vector notation so r is v is v dot x v dot y r is then magnitude squared and i return a copy of it divided by r and so you can see swirl is like okay r is magnitude squared and then i return x times sine of r minus y times cosine of r and if i went back to the paper and i look for swirl you can see here's exactly that formula x times sine of r i'm saying r for r squared uh minus y so um and and transferring this to p5.js wouldn't be um so first of all there's so i could i could yes um ashik is asking about translating this to p5.js that would be somewhat trivial at least for me who's so used to like moving back and forth between these two environments the reason why i would hold off a little bit on that is um these images the way that i'm doing it take an incredibly long time to render let me just pull down my code this is i'm talking about this now so why not go with it so let me pull down my code and i'll try to run it oh wait hold on to show you what i show you what i mean i have to sneeze a sneeze is coming can i try mute my microphone put on some music this is good sneezing music it won't now that i said i was gonna sneak this i'm not going to okay um so what i i don't remember where i left this when i um committed it oops i can't use the computer today thank you so um you can see here these are all the different variations so i'm adding them all in um creating a pixel map and um there's a lot to talk about with this but what i let me just run it see what happens see what we get so you can see this is how long it's taking to render what just happened did something go crazy with the sound oh um so there you go there you see there you see the image i got but um the reason why is it has done a total of that's a total of 100 million points and i'm doing 1 million point per points per frame so that's why i'm able to draw this loading bar and like if i just change this to like 1 million points and like a thousand points per frame well this is silly it doesn't need to it doesn't need to take this long now i'm just animating it for no reason so let's do all the points per frame i just want to see what i get actually that's not so bad so uh but the the the the amount of detail the quality of the image is not as fleshed out if you will as it really requires like a lot of points so let me put back to 100 million points and we'll let this render um certainly a job for the graphics card makes sense there probably is a way so anyway i would like to make a video to and this is what i was thinking of doing as a coding in the cabana video but i'm not ooh i like that one i'm not entirely sure i've gotten this right so and often with the coding of the cabana videos like um i don't really practice or figure it out in advance but this one like i really i was reading the paper and thinking okay well i'll just read the paper and then i'll go do it a coding challenge i would just that's how i would do it but this one i'm really intrigued by and i couldn't resist and plus i feel like i need to prepare for it so anyway that's there that's there for you to look at stay tuned um i will come back um and um and um hopefully you'll see a video about this maybe even in august because i if i'm going to do this coding in the gabano video i've got to record it this week marcos in the chat is asking was this linear or did you add a transformation function so the way that i'm doing this and let's see if i can kind of show it in the paper so the way that this works is um it's a threestep process where where first you apply a transformation a pretransformation so there's a post transform which is right here and let's see if there's a pretransform so each one of these transformations um you you have an input x y and then you have coefficients a b c d e f and so you take you say a times x plus b times y plus c this is like um applying a matrix transformation i think this is kind of like similar to what i've done in some of those in matrix transformation videos i've made so there's six coefficient that's the pretransform and then there is also a post transform which is here uh again uh alpha beta gamma delta epsilon i don't know if i'm doing this right oh i'm so embarrassed but whatever six more coefficients so that's the pre and post and in between those two you you are applied one of these variations so in my code again i'm not entirely sure i'm doing this correctly but in my code if i look at the variation code um i have a function called flame where i get an input vector that's an input x and y so you can think of anything that's the p vectors in x and y and i apply a pretransformation to that then i apply one of the variation functions to it then i apply the post transformation and that's just i have an array of coefficients zero you know coefficient zero times x one times y plus two three times x plus four times y plus five and then i return that vector and then i create when i create a variation i make those arrays they each have six things in it and i just pick the coefficients randomly so uh breaking news what's this is this is this what i'm looking for my marching cubes look up table simon i can't really get to it easily on the computer where i'm looking at the chat you might have to tell me more what that is um but um so so that's how i'm doing it so i'm doing a pretransformation step applying any one of these variations like you can see this sinusoidal one is very simple it's just sine of x sine of y and then a posttransformation what uh what's and then so i could what i could do here is i could show you like what happens if i just do linear and let's let's just do like 10 million instead of so it's a little faster so i get nothing i've got nothing is it is it because i have so few points lars is making an excellent comment in the chat about the marching squares video would you mind adding that as a github issue on codingtrain website or just leaving it as a comment on the actual youtube video itself i'd like to return to that so i'm not getting anything let's try like what if i do just swirl so this is why i feel like i'm doing something wrong uh oh it's a triangulation table okay thank you simon i can get to it from from there so i'm not getting anything for these if i just use one variation maybe that's correct but it's clearly not because in the paper described in the paper there are these really nice examples of these visualizations of the singular variation i would really like to be able to reproduce these so i feel like until i can reproduce those diagrams i'm not ready to make that coding of the cabana video because i'm not entirely sure i'm doing this in the correct way now fortunately the creator of this algorithm themselves scott draves um uh messaged me on twitter and uh said they would look at a code so maybe i'll hear from scott draves um let me see if i can pull up what simon created really quickly just.github.com simon tiger i hope you made it public otherwise i won't be able to get it yep so this is an array of configurations each configuration is another array the numbers are the vertices of the cube every triple triple of numbers represents a triangle oh fantastic i think i understand how to use this i'm not entirely sure but this is perfect thank you simon i feel like maybe i've got till 10 and you know you can see i've done nothing it's 8 40 i'm just talking um swiom is saying how do you choose which variation to apply great question let me go back to my fractal flame code so let's say i put all the variations back in the way i'm running the code and you can you can create a more sophisticated probability map but i am picking um one of these randomly so um i so i have all of these variations in an arraylist of variations and then each frame um i pick a random number between zero and the size of the arraylist then i pick that or variation and then i apply that variation to the current vector and i have a new vector so this is an iterative iterated function system by the way i i should have led with this the prerequisite so to speak for this particular uh algorithm if you want to if you want to like before you read the fractal flame paper and look at my code you should look at um coding challenge uh 123 the chaos game part one and part two because essentially a fractal flame is a uh an augmentation of exactly this particular algorithm the chaos game so but there's the addition of these nonlinear transformations with polar coordinates and sine and cosine and all sorts of other extra stuff and mixing and matching so you can see if i just did a sort of more stan you know you could get these very specific fractal algorithms like the sir pinsky triangle with applying just a singular linear transformation okay um so oh alka is here hello i haven't seen alca in a while or maybe i'm just not paying enough attention nice to see you here all right where was i uh at nine o'clock i'll be taking a short break i'm gonna make sure my kids get set up with their chess class oh by the way hmm is anybody a roblox player out there because i am learning roblox coding and my kids and i are making a roblox game they made one called sword blocks i don't know how to find it maybe if they're when they're when they're in here i'll ask how do i if i could find i think they're the username on roblox um can i i don't i don't want to log in um if i know their username is there a url that i can just go to their page this is really sorry i'll come back to that i'll look for it when i take a break show you their roblox game they wanted people to play it but i was not really ready yet so um okay alka is confirming that i do pay attention alka's not been around that much okay welcome back all right let's get to the good stuff let's start looking at some of the variations that post over some people made so first of all uh we've got a little thing go so thank you to violet who does uh and so many people niko and many others as well but i wanted to thank violet in particular um they do a lot of work on the coding train website and github repositories um and created a new methodology for when a coding video has many many examples involved that here's all the p5 versions you can download the code view the code go to the web editor here's all the processing versions i love that it has the little logo this is this is mostly it doesn't look so crazy because if i go to like a particular video like let's say i just go to uh tictactoe like we just got this one p5.js so it looks sort of normal and then i think we recently realized like oh this uh particular coding in the cabana uh example has so many so i think it might be nice to redo this design a little bit if anybody's a designer out there has some ideas maybe it makes more sense to uh compact this horizontally and like just put it up here i don't know but um so if you have ideas about that but that's why there's this sea of examples and i'm gonna come to some of them but we don't have um i i didn't do a big push in discord i know that kobe has really helped with this in the past of getting people to post encouraging people to post their contributions even if you just play with one of the examples you change some colors i think one thing that you could really try that i didn't that i wish i had emphasized in the video is change what's being drawn you have eight possible possible configurations for what you would draw in a square you don't have to draw the lines exactly like you could draw circles you could draw triangles you could draw the lines in the wrong places like what kind of patterns would you get so i encourage you to make your own um version of it but let's look at what people have created so first let's look i don't know so some of these i might not be able to run uh if um for example i don't know that i can easily run python pi game although that would be fun to try to figure out right now but let's look at re24's source code and well thank you ari for your beautiful community contribution let's just look at it python so this is cool because what ari seems to have done here is write their own um vector like like p5 vector ported p5 vector to python that is so cool lerp all the functions are here that is amazing great job i think a train whistle for that for sure um that is wonderful so that's really nice to see if i knew how to run pygame quickly i would run this so again i know i've mentioned this but something you can do that i would recommend ari if you're watching is add a readme file and then in the readme file you can embed an image and so that way if somebody's looking at it coming to there and they want to see like you could explain a little more about it you know i don't know how much traffic these community contributions generate but that's what i would want to see if i'm browsing the internet and looking for different examples and i wasn't familiar with pygame that i would want to see a readme file there with some annotations so it's as easy as pip install pie game okay um marching squares in a purlin noise field let's take a look at that so maybe by the way i should very very briefly just show um the example from the video so this is the example from the video just so we can sort of get a sense of what people have done that's different this is just the raw marching squares algorithm over a field of per of open simplex noise so let's go back and look at greg kreisman's marching squares in a perlin noise field oh cool oh look at this so anytime i see some sliders i get very excited that means i can play with this in real time zoom so that's cool because oh what i like about this i like the fact that i see the full square there and you know it looks so interesting about this algorithm it looks like these continuous paths but really they only connect because of the sort of cleverness of the algorithm if you will really each square is looked at individually with a line drawn so that's what i mean what would happen if you just drew the lines in a completely different way i think that's some creative possibility artistic possibilities here let me zoom all the way back out oh cool and uh let's what does this one do the noise step oh so that's just like how fast so one of the things that's interesting about purlin noise i don't know how well we'll be able to see this so this look wow it looks like is it just me or are we panning over the noise field vertically i think we are uh that's a pretty interesting way of doing this also i mean which is totally fine but one of the things that i did in my video is i add oh no maybe this is just because of the zoom yeah that's just because of the zoom the zoom level i had it didn't make it all the way to the edge just just could you bear with me for a moment to sneeze was i muted all that time do okay i'm back sorry about that um so with with so a couple things one is um i don't know whether this is you uh it says purlin noise which i know there's a lot of not controversy sort of speed but there's a lot of different uh stages of development that pearl and noise that the sort of purlin noise went through so in processing and p5 uh when when i say pearly noise i'm really referring back to the sort of classic early 1980s perlin noise algorithm but um that particular algorithm has a lot of sort of repeating patterns in it and has a different quality than open simplex noise so that's one thing i was curious to see if we could notice but also um the way that i animate is in the way that i animate it in my example is by using the third dimension uh sort of step through slices of noise 2d noise in a 3d space whereas this looks like it's taking noise in a 2d space and panning down that but i'm not entirely sure that's true i mean we could look at the code let's look at the code uh and let's see um where there yeah so this is using the just the noise function in p5 and it says noise z and z is interesting going up by rows so i think that's sort of like it looks like this is one dimensional noise somehow but the way that it's like being used is maybe going over the columns and then sort of panning i don't know oh gregory's in the chat so that's my question for gregory in the chat is this is a surprise to me to see only one argument here in the noise function if you look for example at my code and again i'm not saying one's a correct way or an incorrect way of doing it that's no such thing i i love the quality this like panning quality that's happening it's quite beautiful and unique i just i'm interested in comparing it so if i go back to mine and i go here to web editor and i look for where am i calculating noise right i am calc my noise function has three arguments x y z by the way the sun has now moved and i'm in the light again it would appear ah simon is by the way i missed something in ari's python contribution i would love to go back to it but i'll just mention it one of the things that it always makes it tricky in processing or p5 and java or javascript is with vectors you have to use these add functions or call these functions to do vector math you can't use the plus minus multiply um operators but in python you can overload those operators so you can actually say vector one plus vector two um i'm not saying an answer to this question which is fine i don't need one right now but that's an interesting that's an interesting uh difference to note okay let's come back to um oh another python one okay i might have to might have to figure out how to run some python stuff today since there's two of them i just did the most simple noise from one dimension yes so that's interesting because uh gregory figured out something very very clever and i'd have to go back and really un unpack the code a bit more but i it never occurred to me that there might be a method for using onedimensional noise but spreading it out over a twodimensional field and then even animating it over time and i think there must be some combination of using like a global starting variable and then incrementing over the 2d space and then moving the starting variable with each frame of animation super interesting technique um okay let's look at marching squares with 3d purlin noise by josh um oh great see readme file that's a ding and a train whistle for both gregory and josh here so first of all rainbow colors you had me you had me at rainbow colors i love how you figured out to sort of like fill in this area um and that's really quite and and fill it in with these with this sort of rainbow gradient that's very unique um weighted colors based on average of each cell's corners uh it looks a bit smoother but the gif has some quality loss oh look at that so that's interesting so i again i think a lot of times um just by varying the drawing style and the color you can come up with some really unique artistic uh variations of the sort of core algorithm so i really appreciate that here's some terrain deformation oh look at that so that's kind of cool to like just use it to create this terrain and then it's almost like it's like food that this little square is running around and eating whoa oh this is didn't make it yeah so this is what i was assuming i would get if i take marching squares into marching cubes and run it over like a 3d open simplex noise field this is what i was kind of assuming i'd get so i'd love to tackle that i don't know when sometimes i i don't know sometimes i wonder so thank you for this this is fantastic i love that you have the documentation and the code that people can look at beautiful work and we've got one more here by fan by principle uh marching squares with square contours p5.js so oh yeah so this is what i was saying so i love this so this is the idea of instead of using the original sort of like iso lines that go from the midpoints what this variation does by fan by principle is uses like straight horizontal and vertical lines which has a really nice quality to it um it feels very kind of retro in a way switch solution wait where's my mouse so now we see the original and switch background oh look at that so that's really nice to see thank you so these are these are wonderful so i i tend to try i really do try to look at all of these i do miss some um and um i know that david isn't here for this live stream but i'm going to pull up something so let's let's just say that you are watching today you didn't realize that you could submit your own community contribution and have it appear on this page so the links you want to look at are this you can also add your own version see how so i think if i click on see how this will give a bit of a page hey i have a little video walkthrough that you can watch um i think it's still a date and then there's a little bit of a text explanation for how to do it and uh if i click on this link add your own version it's going to take me right to the page that you need to edit it's actually going to open it up as so you do the only thing you need is you do need to sign up for a github account there's probably some way to do it without signing up for github account i don't know what that is um um but um so and there it's it's confusing which uses this weird a markup language called yaml yet another markup language or i think there's some other um variations of that why aml um but basically uh you need to follow this format of uh contra under where is it under contributions where's that contributions you can see that you just need a title an author with a name and a url and a source oh but you can also have a url for your project and then a source url so um you know it's tricky so what i would do is i would just take this i would copy it i would like sort of paste it in here i would try to get the indentation to be the same and i would say like marching wacky and i would put my name daniel schiffman and i would change the url and stuff and then i would go down here and i would hit uh well i wants me to be able to commit it directly it's not going to let you do that it's going to create a new branch and start a pull request and you can follow through i'm not going to do this right now to follow through these steps it looks like oh my god am i going to break things i'm going to do it wrong is someone going to yell at me am i doing don't worry think of hearts and rainbows when you're on the coding train github we are here and say we being the community and some people that are specifically helped maintain the repos along with myself are here to help are here to encourage you are here to welcome you in with open arms if you've never filed a pull request before if your variation is exactly the same as the example well that's fine too there's no threshold of achievement we just want you to share uh and feel a sense of accomplishment and participation um in the community so i really encourage you to do so no matter your experience level no matter your background and you know if you run into any issues i guess probably emailing info at thecodingtrain.com is an email address but you can tweet at shiffman or at the coding train and you can also but but really what i would say if you want to help in particular with github and submitting your contribution i'm going to leave this page the best way to do that is to go to the issues page and click new issue so you could click new issue and you could say i would love some help and then you could write here is my question that i would love help with now one thing i'll say is um this isn't really the place for getting uh help with debugging your code uh what i mean more is like help making a contribution or a pull request if you want to if you want help of debugging your code or have a code question the best place for that is actually the discord and so i think i have a little button here um if all goes well the discord will now appear in the chat appeared twice you can join the discord and there's a lot of help channels there where the community will answer questions um yeah okay that's marching squares it is nine o'clock it is time look at me on schedule sort of and it's time for me to check in with my children and their chess class i but hey here's my segue i found a new way to stay on task and stay on schedule and so i'm so excited to tell you about a new sponsor for the coding trade and i'm going to press the button correctly notion and what i oh the thing that i'm really excited about this is i don't even have to ask you to buy anything um there of course there are premium plans and different things that you can get but um with notion which is a productivity software that breaks the mold by combining all essential work tools notes docs databases did i say databases databases you know the way that i'm using it right now so uh if you're a coding trained member you're probably missing your rewards i'm supposed to mail you a sticker or a notebook and i do have piles of envelopes and labels i have these new thank you cards over here i'll give you a little more of a closeup view of it on these thank you cards that i'm sending out um i'm so so late with these and i'm so so sorry um but one of the ways i'm organized with it now is i have all of the members names in the notion database and with the address that i need to send stuff to what i can check off when it's done so i am getting organized with um notion um let me click over to here so notion works like a box of software legos letting you flexibly stack these tools however you want to build your own productivity system so it used to be that to get a personal plan it was five dollars a month but now all personal plans are free forever so free users will be able to add as many blocks as they like to their personal notion database students are using notion for class notes managing tasks organizing job applications you can learn about this at notion.so students high school and college oh high school and college educators use notion to create syllabi communicate with their students and easily publish information the web guess what i'm a well i'm not a high school i'm a college educator in addition to just playing one on tv youtube oh i hear the chess classes started um can you hear oh and i've got a new member um so i didn't actually even realize that until i started looking into notion that's something i will definitely consider maybe there's a way that i can even spin up a coding train course using notion that might be fun to try um and oh and this is this is what there's a mobile app this is what it looks like uh on the mobile app um you know i have to say like i was saying earlier that the way that i have traditionally kept track of my like task lists and todo list is by just emailing myself or use a text file all right once i tried using github for a while and didn't like issues with my todo list but i'm i'm really excited i've been trying in the last couple weeks since uh notion got in touch with setting up and keep keep with a todo list and it's working quite well but really the the the game changer for me has been organizing all of the coding train uh member rewards and things like that so um notion is great for the office has been used by the wall street journal verizon and even pixar i love pixar uh create a company wiki wiki see database wiki i love these terms i have a feeling that there's an api or notion is working on an api i feel like i saw something on the website that's something that would be really exciting to me if i could uh you know as a coder and programmer work with it that way so you can answer questions at scale onboard new employees and track every project catalog logos fonts and assets so thank you so much uh to notion for being a sponsor of the coding train i'm going to take a short break and check on my kids and their chess class uh about five minutes um and if you're interested in checking it out please go to bit.lee notion coding train because that will let them know that you found it through the coding train and you know just a little bit a little bit you can do to that that helps me out as well okay um that's all uh i have to say and i will be back in just a short a bit and the laptop sound is not working where is the music what happened here there we go okay i'll be right back dog do so do and we're back how's it going i just made it just back the whole time thank you notion again bit.lean ocean coding train um the whole time i was trying to log into my roblox account and the password wasn't working i was trying to reset the password i failed oh well i believe my roblox username is actually codingtrain no i don't mean it's actually codingtrain i mean it's actually codingtrain the word actually coding train and if i could log into that i could find i think i have i think i'm in my kids like game studios called ducky studio and then there's a game in there called sword blocks i couldn't find it sometime in the future i will come back and live stream some roblox coding um um in fact i've been just as a little plug i've been watching the alvin blocks youtube channel part of i'm a member of the alvin block's youtube channel and part of their discord where i've been learning uh roblox coding so my uh my roblox game development empire is starting now and probably not going to happen there was something else that i wanted to just mention ah yes so where am i off to next on the coding train uh alka says i hope you look at my marching squares it's not finished but it's a nice effect oh was there another contribution that i missed i don't know where i find it is there a pull request open aha oh wait wait wait open 43 minutes ago i don't see alca oh so unfortunately if you send it to me in the discord there's no way for me to access it on the stream that's way too much technology for me i have the link on this computer right over here and there's just no way i could ever possibly get it onto this computer i mean i could type it in manually so please um add it uh add it as an issue if you want to just put it as an issue here i will look at it but let's look at these two um update marching squares so so here so one of the things that i uh really asked people to do um and no worries srakshan 98 um it's not entirely clear but in addition if you could the reason why the template um has a this part in it is please add a link to it here because this way i could just click um i could just click on it right here to look at it otherwise i have to go into here then i have to find it here then i have to sort of manually copy it out which is no problem just a little bit of an extra step but let's take a look at this cool so this is marching squares playable oh look at that with the with the keyboard i can move this little dot around super fun and i think this was done with typescript train whistle for typescript great work thank you for sharing that and next we have um so same thing only holy um please when you file your issue um if you could also just link to the project right here that way i see it i click on it because that's honestly like they come onto my email um and i can just click on and look at him in my email otherwise i've got to go to the webpage and click around thank you my anime jim very kind of you and i'm going to go here to interpolated contour lines oh i like the sound of this um and let's run this whoa whoa that is really cool oh i love that so i'm curious like how did you create the number field to make this kind of pattern i mean it has a very simplexy noisy like quality but it's different let's see if we can take a quick peek here um move myself up here for a second um so where is the feel oh it's just it's just using a different set of values for noise and i guess with interpolation and the colors it really has a different quality to it so that's amazing to me that this is using the basically the exact same code but just through tweaking different parameters and using color in a creative way i really thought like oh there's something different underlying here so that's wonderful issue alka's version is now as an issue and let's work in progress marching squares contribution and let's go over here on oh i love that let's take a look whoa that is wow so i assume there's some kind of like interesting blending that's going on i love the sort of like 3d quality to this um it's really lovely i feel like it's like a little portals into another dimension or being opened up for me to look through quite beautiful so what i wanted to mention is i do try to look at these community contributions and this reminded me that if i go back to the issues gypsy dangerous here a coding train contributor and viewer and member created this wheel of contributions which randomly picks so we're going to look i'm going to just do one because i want to move on to uh importing a 3d model into processing that'll be kind of where i finish off today um so what this does is it looks back through all of the contributions that i have never shown on a live stream it loads i guess one two three four five six internet ten of them randomly and then i can spin the wheel wow that's right on the line looks like it's in the red well actually we can tell it's in the red because the background is red so i can also say remove and view selected and what we've got is asteroid field by bossy smacks the original challenge is uh this one ah this is coding challenge number one which was done and i just like when was this done let's go over to youtube how long ago look at me look at this youthful glowing shorthaired oh it was a simpler time back in april 2016. oh boy get me a time machine now oh boy let's go back to april 2016. things will things will turn around i am hopeful um uh first coding challenge um this guy has to be the happiest developer alive that's very kind of you um and uh now uh mike i still have some sleep in my eyes i think um or my glasses just need to be cleaned what was i doing okay we're looking at this contribution there it is so let's take a look at the asteroid field which is a variation of the starfield example oh awesome oh this is such a perfect transition to talking about 3d because it looks like to me that these are little like 3d models um i don't know how i'm sure there's a way that i could get to the source code since this is hosted on glitch oh boy do i have some interesting glitch tutorials coming up for you in the fall i have figured out how to run a twitter bot off glitch with web hooks and reply all this stuff oh i'm so excited about it uh if you want to like enter into a very random i know i'm just like mr tangent today i guess i'm always that way let me go up uh and just to go into a completely other tangent austin is asking me if i've checked out standup maths video on complex fibonacci numbers no but everybody keeps telling me to maybe that should just be my next coding in the cabana video that was suggested yeah 2016 was pretty beautiful so okay not anyway um so when i'm up time out focus focus i've got 40 minutes left what i love about this is it looks like it's taking that star field example which was just using um 2d dots and maybe replacing them with 3d models or something that has a more of an asteroid like quality to it i think i could probably move over to glitch and find the source code but um thank you if you if you bossie happen to be in the chat please say hello um but i'm gonna move on so close a bunch of these windows that was when i tried to use a timer uh i will get back i will get back to doing coding challenges again um some people it's interesting the feedback that i get um uh it's very mixed in term i think people mostly the feedback i get is positive thank you very much people like the coding cabana videos they like the coding challenge videos some people seem to very strongly prefer the coding challenge style of just like in a studio with green screen coding coding coding some people like the sort of zen quality i mean i'm not i don't think it's very sad but the different style of the coding cabana with a bit more editing and being sort of in this outdoor space um my plan was always to do both but having trouble finding the time these days okay oh it wasn't 2020. sorry i get everything wrong ah deep breath all right we are here ready to load mewtwo into processing and let's make a world of flocking you choose that's what i'm going to attempt to do in about the next 40 minutes and i will hope that you will take your so so if you want to uh follow along and make your own version the first thing you'll need to do is go back and watch this blender tutorial from chrissy one of the things i really want to get into a better habit of is if i just put time codes in the video description it will make it into chapters and you could find the specific things you're looking for i have a lot of people who work on different coding train projects and nobody at the moment is doing that so i would welcome that as a contribution it's something that i would actually be quite open to hiring somebody to do to like sort of go through the back catalog and time code everything but um you know at this point but also i would take a volunteer so we could sort of think about if anybody's interested in that get in touch um but i wanted to also just give a shout out because this fundraiser is still going on the tender foundation which is an organization that supports mothers in need in atlanta georgia you can still donate we reached the goal for the coding train match but i'm sure the tender foundation would appreciate additional donations if you're if you feel so inclined and are able to donate so i'm going what i'm going to do now is i'm going to open up blender i can't believe i'm opening a blender wait what happened is blender gone uh finder applications blender i don't know what happened it's like let's see if it runs i do not have oh you know what happened that's so weird hold on i think i can fix this hold on give me a moment here talk amongst yourselves duplicate stop i can't believe what i'm doing right now you don't want to know permissions permissions permissions permissions permissions permissions after all of that all right let's just reinstall it why do you forsake me replace wow kay wickman joined as a patron after watching the mender sponge challenge when was that let's first of all see it do i appear no oh april 17th you've been a patron since 2016 oh that was cody challenge number oh two goodness oh thank you k week fun maybe the longest i don't know who the longest patron is i'm gonna have to look that up that's a thing i can look up i'm sure you're definitely in the running by the way i paid my children in robux to decorate all of these so last night they were up very late at night coloring and decorating these lovely children they are um ethan writes hey dad what you coding the funny thing is my son and i have a joke which is that i like to say things like son i'm going to teach you a life lesson and he just starts to laugh falls on the floor laughing it's so ridiculous no one takes me seriously all right um what was i doing oh yes reinstalling blender let's see let's see how did that go all my sound effects are in different places now yes open blender okay so now let's open up um i think this is my model coding train model which should be called muchu what's happening let me close this there's mewtwo so what i need to do is export um iraqi ask is there a discord without patreon yes there is i'm giving you the link right now um so one of the things i'm not sure about is well let's just see what happens so this is mewtwo let's uh select and let's go to file uh export and i'm going to export as an obj so i'm exporting as an obj and then oh and i think i already did this fortunately but i spelled it wrong i told a new chew with chew that's hilarious let's spell it correctly mu chu coding train desktop that works export x wait wait hold on are there things selection only object says obj objects scale path mode i don't know what any of this stuff means uh i don't know what any of this stuff means so i maybe so let's just see export object okay there we go so now i should have on the desktop um here is so there's the obj file what's interesting is to look at these files so let's look at these files in visual studio code which of course is not a thing that's open right here so let's uh open uh desktop let's look at these two files so a couple things one is so the mtl file and by the way this is all totally new stuff to me i don't really know what i'm talking about this is the material file um so it has information about the material somebody in the chat will explain what material means but more what i'm kind of fascinated by is the obj file so the obj file is literally just a list of vertices x y z x z xyz xyz so it seems like oh i'm exporting this file like we could write our own code that comes up with a 3d shape calculates all these vertices writes it out to an obj file and then imports it into say a program like blender or any other 3d modeling program so usually the way that i the only way that i've known how to do things is by working in code and exporting that way an obj file but now the difference here is i have with my bare hands really the mouse modeled out of digital clay the beautiful wonderful mewtwo character i love you mewtwo if i ever get another pet its name is definitely gonna be mewtwo gloria where's gloria are you around here oh gloria's not here gloria's usually sitting right next to me this whole time i don't know where she went um but anyway uh gloria if i ever get you a doggy brother or sister mewtwo will be its name i don't know if my kids will go with that but but now this looks right i should be able to import this into processing so let's uh close out fractal flame um please get in touch if you work on uh on github or twitter if you uh go back and if you're watching my discussion of fractal flames and have any answers or thoughts for me i'm gonna hit don't save um let's i think what i'll do is let me create a new sketch um new sh mewtwo flock and let's add setup let's add draw we'll make a nice window i don't know i don't know what for old times sake we'll say background 51. and oh this is definitely going to need to use the 3d renderer and then i want to make a folder called data and what i want to do is get my model and bring it in and put it in the data folder oh do you hear that little boy i think that sound effect is happening it's very exciting apple if you want to get in touch and need somebody to record some new sound effects for you every time somebody drags and moves the file you could have just think about it give me a call i'm available um so now i should be able to say p shape mewtwo i think and chew equals load shape and then just the name of the file mutu.obj and then um translate to the center and draw mutu so this should be the basic code for loading an obj file into processing and displaying it what's the chance oh that that you you always have been hearing that sound effect that's so funny i just never heard it in my monitor before i set things up in a different way wait i think that's mewtwo there there's mewtwo i need a i need a like heavenly sound they don't have that do i have anything that fits yeah there's youtube youtube that doesn't work so that was weird that made me very uncomfortable okay um so i think i just need to say scale to make youtube bigger ah there's mewtwo let's add some lights there we go oh it's upside down uh let's say uh translate one comma negative one that flips the world has y point up no do i need to do that first wait i'm confused why is mucho upside down mewtwo you're upside down oh were you not upside down before and i was just confused i'm so confused let's um should i should i just use pz cam here let me do a rotation uh angle equals zero uh rotate y angle angle plus equal like some small rotation oh no mewtwo is not reference point around the center oh did i write scale oh i have scale 100 here i think if i do this whoa yeah so i flipped mewtwo around the lights are weird but mewtwo is not oh so how someone's gonna have to help me figure out how to do this in blender shoot um i think okay let me go back to blender oh where's chrissy chrissy call chrissy phone a friend uh so frank is asking you didn't have to write all the code to read the points and connect them right so i didn't have to do that so this is a great question so i was showing you what's in the obj file and i could parse it and create all the geometry myself and that would be a super exciting fascinating thing to do however that's what processing has built into it a uh p shape class and it knows how to read obj files and render that geometry so i'm making use of that i have to make the object to the origin select the object and alt g says marcos okay so alt is probably option select option g maybe i have to group it first uh is there a way to like group it how do i group oh g oh no that's what i no i mean i could just take this now and move it back and then maybe the center is the head how to set mesh origin alt g won't do it okay hold on okay uh press f3 and origin to geometry i don't have f3 you think i have an f3 button on this apple keyboard i've got this magical touchpad that blinks and it gives me emojis i i do have an escape button thank goodness but there's no f3 good luck finding the f3 function oh there we go function never knew how to do this before f3 um f3 origin to geometry origin snap cursor to world origin a to select all shift s actually i think i've seen this shift s ah which one of these cursor to world origin no did that do it cursor to selected selection to cursor that's kind of like what i did before uh shift s right origin which one now people this is definitely search for it no no no why search when i have a chat with 520 people watching who are you people what is going on usually this i i like very specifically did not promote this stream at all because i was like i don't really want anybody to tune in i need to be in object edit mode first object i forgot tab gets me to edit mode right i thought it was tab am i in edit mode oh yeah i wish i was on a call wait solar liner we can make this happen we can make a call happen selection to cursor keep offset okay so oh this one thank you boom did that do it selection to cursor i'm doing it over and over again all right i'm i'm going to hope that worked this is so frustrating sorry solar liner uh okay let's see if that worked file export uh i'm reading your chat solar line i'm reading it directly uh but maybe i got it right now let's let's uh you two let's replace oh whoops um okay hold on export obj let's set it to uh documents processing mutu flock data let's see if this did it oh where'd muchu go oh i wrote translate one i see ah translate it should have been scaled all right let's make this call happen solar liner i can get you but problem is i don't think i can people can hear you but let's see uh solar liner let's go into a voice channel um did you friend request me okay where where are you solar liner we're gonna we're gonna make this happen just go into the um okay okay hold on hold on hold on solo let's make this call thing happen uh disable um how do i find my friend requests friend solar liner oh wait wait okay hold on i'm a professional live streamer people i've lost where i am okay solar liner uh view profile send message hello okay now call hello uh oh okay wait can people hear i your your audio is very your audio is very unclear to me you cannot hear it okay i have to hang up i can't hear you at all hello oh that's much better all right hold on let me see if hold on hold on i'm going to see if your audio will go into the stream all right now say something i will say something one two okay hold on way too loud try again okay okay so solar liner is now audio is now in the stream and um i'm also uh going to uh screen share with you so you can see what i'm doing without the delay so hold on a second start my obs virtual camera oh not screen share turn on camera and then oh i don't know why it's uh reversed so horizontal flip okay so can you see in discord now um and hear me still uh in this car it is flipped in discord on my end okay i should have fixed it now oh it's flipped on your end is it not flipped now yeah yeah yeah okay sorry there you go okay okay okay we've got a a spontaneous guest here who knows blender and uh um is going so i can you can see my blender screen now yes yes i can okay tell me what to do this is very exciting all right so you have basically what's happening is that you i don't know if you see but you have to when you it shows when you select the meshes you have orange points yes those orange points represent the origin of each of the meshes offset they're like in where place because what happened during the last room is that you move the geometry in edit mode which moves the vertices but not the origin there's a function uh in blender with the f3 menu and there's a search bar top and if you type origin to geometry yeah there's a set a set origin on the f3 menu this one set origin origin to geometry oh sorry i zoomed this one i think i've i've lost your video i messed it up probably by zooming let me stop and start it again is it back uhoh right i'm back okay right there's a uh um origin to geometry okay i'm gonna select that yep okay like an option on the menu got it and then now what i'm done now uhoh my internet connection is not helpful it's not a help photo uh yes it worked okay now i think you can maybe uh maybe you can try exposing that i'm not sure if uh i'm not sure the processing is going to handle both meshes maybe there's an option to join the matches okay well let me let me export it and let's see all right oh that looks oh wait hmm did you did you uh i don't think you've moved the new file i i uh i think so no these are the new files let me delete them oh because export oh volume increase on guest okay sorry you're very quiet i'm gonna move it up okay okay um all right i exported it okay so the second okay so um we're gonna try the second method the second method is to do ctrl j or command j i think on mac from blender that's gonna take the two meshes and join them into one yeah it also moved them around in a weird way and now hold on so ctrl j command j too loud now okay okay okay too loud now uh um command or command my my internet is not it's not being cooperative right now um i think that's only one mesh yeah yes now you can try the l the alt g uh key to center the center dimension oh no that's two meshes actually you can add any more like you can you can work with the f3 menu if you search but one thing couldn't i just do this a join selection to cursor to world origin and then selection to cursor and then can i just move this one yes like what if i do this that's not gonna work uh that's not that's not gonna work no that's not gonna work because what you need to do is you need to bring mucho to the center of the grid in blender hold on let's see here i've lost the regular chat right click set origin geometry to origin oh yeah i was not i was not aware that this was an option in the new versions of blender i used to i used to use blender back before there was back in the times where you had to right click to select if that uh thanks to people select both control control j okay ah there we go i got it joined it's one mesh now yes okay and now so now the origin is still lopsided uh still in a weird place so you can try that trick of uh setting the origin to geometry again so that was the right click set origin origin to geometry i don't have i don't have a right click option i have shift s whoops you can't you can't right click on the mac os what is this cursor which one of these i feel like this selection the cursor oops should work that sets the origin to the cursor but the origin is still blocked like it's still an offset from the mesh so you need to reset the origin you need to make the origin at the center of the mesh and then you can use that to sometimes so that was function f3 yeah um set origin origin origin to symmetry oh but that messes up the model oh because yes uh let me see the under on the right is a wrench tab on the bottom right that's the modifiers panel on uh on the right of the app there's a there's a set of tabs colorful icons oh yeah these and then there's a wrench yeah uh yeah so apply that modifier there's an apply button on the top yep there we go and now you can do again the set origin trick so function f3 set origin origin to geometry oh i see that look there we go there's a little dot look at that dot it's so perfect that represents okay okay file export no no no no wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait there's one more step okay one last trick for my final trick i will make it centered now you can do the shift s um selection textures or selection the correction and then oh look at that okay and now you can export it uh export to obj right here and now open up processing and there we go we did myself it but i did it okay thank you thank you for that all right i'm hanging up this call and because i think now i'm ready to move into processing thank you so much go back to okay all right we're back everybody whoo that was rough that was rough but i learned something there uh and i'm just trying to get all my monitor stuff back i was like some real technical gymnastics virtual cam go away now why is the light so weird but that i'm not too worried about i could let me translate i have an idea let me translate this back a little bit yeah i mean uh let's see what other kind i want to be able to see it so this is really now a processing issue let me see this is really what i meant to do let's set the world back a little bit more okay there we go so i'm not seeing any of the nice shading of mewtwo um but i am seeing muchoo so great so i i can i can maybe try some other kind of lighting oh i took the lights out whoops interesting so oh maybe because the material let's um let's go to uh processing reference for 10 minutes people it's okay uh lights ambient light let's try ambient light light specular so many options directional light let's try i like how this looks so let's try this directional light and ambient light see how that looks hmm i wonder if it's like something to do with the material um it might be it might be actually an issue with the model itself um let's put in uh let's put in a box and see what that looks like no the box is also no stroke this is like this example is it because it's like directly in the center maybe i need to move the light what if i use a point light because i think a point light is like yeah let's try this weird oh wait what is going on okay there we go now i'm seeing something i think i have an idea i have an idea i know this seems crazy but i have an idea ambient light let's try this yeah okay i have an idea which is um i'm going to reexport i think there's an option let me just change the scale in here so i'm going to change the scale here and see if that i mean this seems like a crazy and now okay that's a oh that's because the box is there okay the normals are inverted because of the scaling and processing change the direction with the up axis oh i see all right let's um let's get rid of this oh yeah look at that ah ah look at that okay also the the mutual's really all deform okay oh okay i have an idea so let's just uh rotate uh flip it around the xaxis 180 degrees pi is that right there we go and now let's get rid of the box out of its head okay so i could have changed the export uh i could have changed the export why what did i do i did something to the model where it's all like um right because oh no no that slice this was not i did something to the model where it lost that's fine mewtwo has a little slice cut out of it no problem no problem okay people ready for this now i've got a crazy idea let's go to examples let's go to uh topics simulate flocking okay so this is the flocking example so what i want to do is change this to flocking it's not really i'm not really doing 3d flocking i'm going to do i'm going to call it flocking plane but i'm going to change this to a p3d i'm going to change i want to and then i want to draw um just want to rotate it by like a little bit let's if i'm looking at it this way i want to just offset the xaxis by like 45 degrees yeah so okay perfect so now i want these voids to be at zero zero and the flock the voids the edges should be um well i'm just going to make up something i mean this is ridiculous what i'm doing because i should put that into a variable okay so the flocking is now happening on this like plane whoa watch i would like to be able to see so let's draw now a uh rectangle rectmode center so let's do let's call let's let's create a variable that's like the dimensions make that 500. so i want to make draw a rectangle at 0 0 dimension times 2 dimension times 2 let's say stroke 255 and a fill let's give this a fill with some alpha should see yeah that's the plane so when they get to the edge great so what i want to do is and let's uh let's uh send this out a little bit um i mean i've got some like major perspective issues uh and let's make the plane like much bigger so it sort of like fills the space okay and let's also actually let's do let's get pz cam because i think pz cam is gonna be a nice thing for me to have and i always forget how it works so i'm going to go to contributed libraries oh come on processing i'm going to restart processing um let's open up just to have um contributed libraries pisa cam i just want this basic one so this allows me to sort of like zoom in and out and move around the space so um let me go back to my flocking plane and a piece of cam over here flocking plane so i just need to create a piece of cam and cam equals new pisa cam and import piece of cam and i think that's all i need to do to have like a basic pz cam and now i don't i think i don't need this anymore or this let's see what i get yeah so i can fly around i don't know what and see the like little ants i kind of need a bigger window here um and maybe let's make this 200 whoa okay i like this let's rotate let's put that rotate x back in just to have it start a little bit offset and actually let's zoom out further i like actually seeing the plane uh okay this works so now i can i've got this little world this little plane and it's got like the flocks moving on it and what i want to do now is put my mewtwo characters there so let's go to uh open recent um mewtwo flock which is what the other thing is so uh and i need to just transfer over the data file the data folder i would like to fix the model so maybe someone can help help me with that um but what i thought actually is like maybe i could get one of the community uh created models um so now oops yeah that's fine so oh i didn't want that to go away come back so i want to create p shape mewtwo load mewtwo and then in the flock no in the boyd um i'm gonna have to i want this so where before i was drawing a triangle translating to the position and rotating by the angle which i still want to do i don't want the triangle anymore i want to flip let's first flip muchu oh and probably mewtwo is going to be sitting at the center of the plane so i'll have to translate up a little bit but let's just see what happens i think muchu is huge scale what's going on oh there's too many calls to push me oh i forgot the pop matrix that's important there we go you two where are you there you are this is not exactly what i had dreamed of oh yeah so if you choose like in sliced down the middle uh so let's see here um let's translate up a little bit um like to translate let's offset let's rotate mutual and then translate off by like 50. whoa what did i just do that's is that the wrong no no no yeah i want to orient mewtwo and then pop it up a little bit like let's just make it oh scale is happening aft what is going on uh oh god position x y then rotate oh no no no no no no i want to move i need something to translate here right because oh not y what z z translate up like z i want so this would be there we go so now the flock is like above the plane but i only need to translate by like 55 i think yeah still let's try i mean i'm sure there's a scientific way of doing it there we go is my scale i want to just i want to just mute you to be smaller yeah so let's see if i add some lights now if that'll do something there's my little creatures go run around flock with each other this is this is not turning out like i had hoped let's try adding some lights can i do something with material oh there we go oh wait mewtwo is sideways mutual is sideways oh the zooming is like mewtwo is sideways okay all right so this rotate by x by pi is wrong still sideways oh i just need to also no that's right but i also need to rotate by y 90. is it y or z no z is rotating like this x yeah this should be no no no not not that by not x rotate y pi divided by two this should get mutual to stand up there we go why are they wiggling like that i like that look at that little just flocking around wiggling i think they're wiggling because of this rotation this root so first first stand it up flip it over then rotate along z yeah they should be turning the direction they're moving yeah no it's right uhoh i'm so confused okay hold on let's do these one at a time this should stand them up no that didn't stand them up i'm so lost i'm just going to try every axis yes that stood them up okay rotate x stands them up and they're actually i that also they're in the right orientation their head is on top so now i should be able to just rotate by the direction that they're going in not along z is that so if they've stood up oh maybe i'm y then is the direction that they're moving in there we go now they're rotated in the direction they're moving there we go there we go so this is exactly what i meant to happen now let's do let's have them be half the size that's better and let's make um let's make many more of them there we go so muse fly sort of fitting to have them above now i could add z there's absolutely no reason now that i'm in 3d why i couldn't give them a z and have their vector a little bit all the vector mass should be the same um give them an initial give them an initial 3d velocity vector oh they're flying oh my god flocking in 3d the problem is i need to give their i need to give them a bounding box also along z and this should be right now that i have that global variable and then i should do it for z now let me draw the box let me draw instead of a rectangle i think if i do box dimensions times two and i should say no fill stroke weight eight let's make it this should be their bounding box [Laughter] okay this is pretty wild not what i expected to make now i feel like the flocking is very clumpy so what do what parameter this is just the sort of like core example so a couple things i could do is let's wait the separation much more let's wait separation more because it'll make them a little more and i think i also need to think about their distance that they see each other like their desired separation is just 25. so let's make this uh 10 of the dimension and then i think in alignment let's make this 20 percent and cohesion let's also make that 20 so i think this should keep how to paint them pink um can i i think in i can do this i think i can apply a fill no let me have this zoomed out i guess that's i don't know what this argument does okay it does do what i think it does no it's like the like something about like the field of view or something i think i was i'm confused about what this argument is um and then because i can do this whoa what is going on there we go this is what i was looking to see oh no no that's bad oh i don't know how to use pz cam let me actually just take off pz cam oh wow that perspective is so weird that's sort of what i expected to see and what happened to my angle oh i don't have it anymore oh okay okay okay relax everybody that was kind of fast pink ambient light okay we'll try that oh they're sideways again because i did something i guess not using pz cam um this is what i wanted to see but i kind of want to have pz cam also so let's see if i can make that happen so if i change this to put the pz cam back in what if i do this whoa i don't know i don't know what's happening anymore oh i'm above everything there we go this works all right use pizza cam with mouse okay there's so now all right i gotta i gotta slow down stop let me try oh i rotated space not the cam oh i can rotate the cam right but this is fine i like this i like being in the middle actually so let's see if i can get um ambient light that's pink let's try that um if i say ambient light 255 50 255. let's see what this does yeah there we go okay now we're talking all right does anybody have yeah i should do and avoid the boundary i should have a force that pushes them back in but i i gotta stop this is enough i gotta go this is the project i wanted to make now the question is could i get a i mean i love mute my mewtwo but does anybody marcos does is your model available could you export your mu your mute your mu model because i would like to see how this looks with a um a better a better or different model also i want to see how many i can really fit in so how many oh this is i don't need this how many do i have 300 let's try 500. oops i like how they're actually just rotating along the x y plane it is in another computer oh well did anybody is i forgot to ask chrissy for her uh mew model but i can get i can get that i can just share it on social media um what happens by the way so maybe well i think i'm done let's try making this uh full screen i think i'm done for today it is 10 20 i'm 20 minutes past where i meant to be i mean one thing that would be interesting here is i kind of like so i sort of have a weird idea which is let me get rid of this box and now i'm just in the middle here now of a world of i'm upside down they're so far away without the box i'm really lost oh there we go this is what i wanted to see remove the mewtwo fill line is that really going to make a difference oh yeah the other kind of question i have is i have both lights and ambient light so that's with just the ambient light so i guess it's good to have them both does it matter what order this is in oh interesting it does matter so maybe this light doesn't need to be as bright oh is youtube's compression having a hard time with this sorry so if you can make a now imagine if i had multiple models i don't know i kind of want to fix the little like cutout there or maybe that's just sort of like a nice quality um i would want to put in like an octree or quad tree so i could just have so many more um but i think i'm done for today [Laughter] unless anybody has like a really really like great suggestion of something i should absolutely do or a mew model there can be only one oh interesting so am i doing yeah let's see what other i mean part of me wants to actually follow the perspective of one of them use all right that's the last thing i'm gonna do um but i think that's gonna mess up oh no because all right let me look at pz cam let me understand pz cam a little bit more because i can't stop hello pc cam off screen hello pc head up display no camera states what's that does this do so i think if i wanted to follow one of them i couldn't use pz cam instead what i would do is oh i'm in the wrong thing like right if so let's take let me take out pz cam again and this is just the default view but if i want to follow one of the muse for example if i were to say void follow equals and let's get rid of this rotate y for a second equals flock dot boyds.getzero flock.boyds.get0. so that's the very first void in the array couldn't i just translate to the center of that void follow dot what is it called position position i mean like there is a look at function and a camera function in but what if i just translate to that void's location and everything is drawn relative to it oh negative oh but then i would need to draw everything offset from now wouldn't this work like if i translate the world then it's going to be at 0 0. oh but i also need to translate to the center but i feel like i should be flying through can't you move the cameras yeah but like this particular boy should always be at the center let's zoom out a little bit it's a bit offcenter i know what am i missing here we're tracking it but we're too far away but it should be if it's being drawn at its position its position should be at oh this isn't really where the camera is maybe i do need to use the processing camera all right let's try that or look at isn't there like a look at or camera wait i wrote a tutorial about this p3d look there's a tutorial about this uh lighting okay perspective okay camera eye position scene center upwards axis okay let's use the actual camera i'm gonna keep this all right okay great so that's this is with the camera being at the sort of like so the arguments are i position so the i position i actually want it to be at zero zero what happens if i just make it zero zero zero then the scene center is also zero zero zero and the upwards axis is zero one zero right so i position scene center up axis oh there's everything let's also not make this full screen anymore just a little easier to see so typically if the eye position now should be offset from this right okay yes so i'm above the scene okay i'm above the scene but now what i want to be is i want to be at oh no no i want the scene center to be this particular boyd okay so i'm getting closer here but what do i where do i want the oh the eye position should just be like a little bit offset what if i had the eye position where that boy is oh but i'm looking i can't that doesn't make sense can the oh can the scene center still be this but the eye i don't feel like i'm flying around i think i am though did i oh z i thank you yeah this is me flying around you can't really see because i just jumped and uh looking up is x what if looking up is z there we go up other way here i am flying around oh i'm always looking at the i'm always looking i'm at that boy but i'm not looking straight ahead i'm always looking at the center of the scene so that's kind of weird maybe what i wanted to use is look at is there a look at function no i think the camera so i suppose what i could do is i could have my eye oh and i could just look straight ahead so i could always say like hey you know where i'm looking i'm looking at where i am plus straight at so if x if y were up straight ahead would be z let's try looking straight ahead plus like 50. minus 50. not do i need to like look really much further away yeah uh look in the y direction where are all you people where are you i just want to look oh there we go yeah this is me looking straight ahead now it's funny they don't look like they're flying because i'm flying with them i guess let's put the box back in yeah now we see i'm flying around the box oh i could look in the i should be looking in the direction of my velocity ah so i should be able to say so position is where i am and the direction is my position plus that where i'm going i can look in the direction of my velocity so this would be pause dot x pause dot y pause dot z and look in direction.x direction.y direction.z that should work right my velocity is very i'm looking behind myself i think oh my god the velocity is very shaky shaky camera work there i could smooth it out all right let's do um i got an idea here p vector d i r equals new p vector and then i'm going to say that's uh uh i'm gonna say like let's call this smooth let's let's call this dir and let's let's call this i'm actually gonna call this look at i'm going to call that look at i'm going to say look at dot lerp direction 0.1 so this should smooth it out oh but then i need to put look at in here smoother let's say point zero one there we go this is what i meant all along now i don't love that every time i hit the edge oh this is fun the question is do we like having the box there let's make the background a color let me get the coding train color palette let's try some coding train colors um this is the only way i know how to get there the cj made this website which i really need to be i need to like permanently let's try this color for the ambient light and let's try like this color for the background well i like this um now the question is can i what happens if i give the box a slight fill like just out of curiosity what happens if i give the box this fill okay so the box is white that's interesting what if i go here and get like this yellow color but give it like a lot of alpha it's just blending with the background is there an issue i wonder one thing i should do is i shouldn't render that first void so hmm oh this is kind of annoying the way that i've written this code run render oh i see um let's just do this and then first is false i just want to treat the first one differently um so um so just in case that's messing anything up let's not render that first one it's just the camera okay i don't think that changed anything hit the box and bounce off i know that's not really going to work with flocking i guess i could try it let's try it that'll be the last thing let's try um switching what the edges do this is definitely going to be a problem all right this is going to be really annoying but i'm going to do it i'm going to do them each individually well let's see else if position dot x is greater than dimm so that's x y y i was going to make a force but let's just try this see did i get this right okay let's see what happens oh hi gloria it's looking back no that's not intended it should be looking where it's going yeah it really has to be a force but that's going to take me a lot longer to write that code negative z is forward i know this is kind of doing something along the lines of what i had hoped it's going to get stuck around the edge quite a bit so how do i fix it from looking forward like it's it's looking in the direction of its velocity how would i change that is that this no now it's just upside down you need to keep the direction not to look at i don't understand add the position after the lerp oh right thank you okay okay okay gloria's here everybody hi good doggie yes i know you probably need me to take you for a walk okay okay yes this is you're making it hard for me to code yes i know you're such a good girl they can't really see you [Laughter] okay okay okay come on can you take a break please i know i know i love you too you could taco okay wait let me just fix this one thing let me just fix this one thing please i think if i look away from her she will decide to go to sleep it worked um okay absolutely right that this i have to lerp with the velocity and then oh no no and then so i need a smooth lerp v so i always lerp the velocity and then position dot and then look at is the position plus the lerp velocity i don't know what that's really going to do but that's this is more correct oh no i feel like i'm flying now yes i'm stuck at the edge i gotta go back to my other borders i i gotta stop so we're gonna this is this is not really a great solution so just for right now we're gonna go with the wrap around borders okay i think i liked it better with and this is the last thing i'm going to do without a fill for the box we can make the stroke color of the box that yellow and then let's make this full screen and i think we're done uh oh i still think i need to say no phil there we go okay everybody what's some good music to go with this thank you for watching today's episode of the coding train where we're flying through a world of views flocking in beautiful space bit behind no we oh behind the oh oh come on that's a good idea oh oh why do i have to do this idea now i'm just curious okay so first i would have to render it this is definitely the last thing i'm doing oh my god it's almost eleven o'clock so uh subtract so couldn't i then if i subtract the velocity and i switch the order of these am i going to see it i think i'm looking backwards and i also need to scale this up position minus that times like 50. i think i'm looking backwards if i'm looking backwards oh weird somebody else is going to have to figure this out for me i'm too tight brain is totally i'm totally brain dead uh so i'm at the lookout position and i'm looking at the position subtract the position from the the velocity minus the position i mean like this couldn't possibly be it could it oh boy look at that oh now i'm definitely looking backwards the camera zener is clipping the void and i'm looking at it from above negative look at no no no yeah i could pick a random one but picking the first one is the same you need to bring the near plane back to let closer objects be drawn reduce the near plane value on the 3d render this is kind of interesting though whatever i i don't know how to do that in processing affect the z near plane i was just trying to go like really really far away like i figured like multiplying the velocity by 250 i think i'm actually following it i'm just really far away so you don't see it near add minus that's what i'm doing add minus oh but let's try subtracting it yeah yeah i like this i don't know if i i'm behind it by quite a bit let's try being behind it by less it's sort of like where i start also it makes such a difference because now i've sort of like started near the edge so let's go back to thank you for everyone for tuning in to the world of flying news flying news oh we're flying through the world seeing all the news yeah i am fault there's one that i'm following does it can't you sort of see that there's one that i'm following um i don't know if i'm going to make this into a p5.js version that would be interesting to try i will i will upload this um all of the voids spawn at the center so i'm pretty sure i'm spawning them all at the center but i don't know i'm this is my last live stream probably until me i would say september i was gonna say maybe like the last couple days of august i might have one but this is probably the last live stream until september um oh my god my desktop audio is still highlight the follow i don't know how to do that okay i'm going to release this code this is what i suggest highlighting the follow one cleaning up using a different model so many possibilities let me upload this somewhere right now and please make a version of this and share it with me where is this on the desktop music is quite hilarious so i am going to say thank you to everybody i it's not the end of the year that seems like because it's just a random date in july but for me i kind of my life so operates on the academic calendar this is kind of like really the end of the year for me so uh thank you everybody for your support whether it's watching it's tweeting it's giving your community contributions it's joining as a member um all this stuff is really meaningful to me i really enjoy having the chance to connect and code and do weird stuff like this um i'm gonna leave this running for a little bit to read your messages in the chat um i'm gonna take you out with by readings also some random numbers and please join the discord here's the link to the discord stay tuned hopefully for some other videos will come out get in touch with me if you want to help me with the fractal flame stuff and i'm going to read you some random numbers okay goodbye everybody forty five thousand six hundred seventy four ninety seven
