hello uh this is probably one of the strangest videos I've ever made I haven't actually made it yet but I see into the future this uh but I I found a strange bug issue in P5 Jazz I just don't know what to do about it at all so I'm kind of filing a GitHub Video issue I will type an actual GitHub issue but this might be useful for some of you wondering about open source how it works where things are and there's probably a lot of stuff I'm going to gloss over here but maybe you'll find this useful to watch watch maybe you won't but let me give you some background here I was making a simple p5js sketch I'm I'm going to I'm doing this in Sublime with the Chrome browser all this sketch is doing is creating a video element and what I wanted to do was look at the pixels of this video but the video by default the video by default is 3 well well you'll see in a second is if I rerun this it's coming in from my web camera at 64 by 480 but I want to shrink it down and I want those pixels to be shrunk down so I call the P5 size function and once I call the P5 size function it shrinks the video and the pixels should also shrink so let me show you what I mean in the Chrome console here I can say video. load pixels this is a function that would then make the pixels available of that video now so I've loaded the pixels now if I were to look at at the pixel array where all the pixels are you'd think I would have a an array that has this many spots in it for every single color there are four spots in the array red green blue Alpha the width of the video image now is 320 the height is 240 so the total number of pixels should be 320 * 240 * 4 which is this particular number 37,200 however ever if I say video. pixels. length I get this weird number Wella that's not what should have happened hold on a second here everybody just relax and by everybody I mean me um I think I might have uh messed something up so uh I just need to very quickly make sure I'm using the actual um oh this video is rude uh skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead um uh I'm going to I going to make sure I'm getting the uh most recent I I was fussing with the Dom library and uh I probably made it do something it shouldn't have done so I'm going to go and paste this in there then I am going to uh refresh this and I'm going to do the same exact thing video . pix pixels. length you can see that's of course zero because I haven't called load pixels yet once I do that yes okay so I had already fed with the Dom library in trying to debug this but now I'm using the actual current state of the Dom library look at that particular number right remember we said it should be 320 * 240 * 4 which is that number what is that number that number is 640 by 480 * 4 because even though I've resized the video the pixels are still at the original resolution which is not what I want the P5 library to do why is this happening so um what I can do is actually go in now I'm actually this is actually the P5 Dom Library it's a ton of code we could be here for like the next four hours going through all of it I happen to know that very deep in this code is a place where when I call load pixels this thing happens where it makes it behind the sc's canvas and the canvas is made with the video width and the video height I want that canvas to be made 320x 240 now a long time ago I don't know when I can look it up here I actually posted a GitHub issue so now I'm on GitHub I'm in the p5js repository on GitHub and there is a particular issue I posted called P5 media element size and this is uh I'm writing a description Lauren McCarthy and I just talked about blah blah blah blah blah blah and I noticed that there's a problem where the canvas is being set to video width and video height where it actually should get the Dom elements width and height and this somehow like fixes this problem and in fact we can say oh thanks for catching this Lauren this is there was something tricky with this Lauren made a commit that changes it we can actually look at this commit right here oops sorry right here and I can pinpoint this is the commit it used to be video width video height and it used and that got changed to width and height so let's go and make that change in the actual code I'm going to go here right I could just check that I'm going to change that to width change this to width change this to height and I'm going to run my sketch again we can see what if I call now video. load pixels okay I called that and now I say what's that number what's that number it worked so that fixed it that line of code for this particular thing that I'm trying to do should be width and height not video width and video height which are still 640 x480 because they're referring to the original video width and video height now strangely enough that commit if I go back to the browser right that commit happened on January 15th what's today's date March something boy that was March 29 I have no idea what the date is on my watch here ah it's March 29th Tuesday March 29th so I did some investigation and I went through and strangely enough I found another commit look at this this commit is 26 days ago early in March where this got changed back also by Lauren McCarthy well why did this happen so this is closing issue 1274 here's 1274 somebody else uh Keith O'Hara posted an issue they were running into problems using get blah blah blah so for some reason that change caused another problem and it got reverted forgetting that that would cause some other problem so we're in this like horrible circular problem causing so what do we do now I don't know the right answer but I have spent I spent at least two hours today not two hours I spent a lot of time because looking through digging through trying to pinpoint the exact commits where this has happened so I think live on air live from the school for poetic computation this sounds very grandiose it's not grandiose I'm in I'm just like a person typing at a computer but I would like to uh uh contribute to this discussion and see if we can figure this out so I don't know there's a couple options here I could reopen this issue that might make the most sense this was the original place where I was discussing this and this is where this exact I'm showing this exact change needs to happen so this might make the most sense I could just comment on this particular commit there's a place here I could comment on the commit uh I could also like reopen this issue and say hey I think this caused a problem with another issue I don't know where the right places and by the way this is something that happens when you're like trying to file GitHub issues you always feel like you're doing it wrong and someone's going to yell at you and that does actually happen because people sometimes aren't they just aren't thinking and maybe typing tone is lost or sometimes people are just like not nice actually but I want to say to you that p5js is a place where anybody in the world can post a GI issue and there's no way to do it wrong so post away and if someone tells you you did it wrong come and find me because there's no way that was possible um but it's a welcoming place that anyone should be able to try to participate in this open source stuff so let me I don't I'm also not entirely sure the best way to do this but I'm gonna I'm going to just try reopening this particular issue so one um so one thing I'm going to do here is type into this uh box here and you guys can type with me or not type with me I'm gonna think okay um this particular fix was changed back due to issue so now I need to refer to this particular issue which is number 1274 1274 you can see how this commit which was this one which has this commit one thing you can always do is like see these like crazy numbers that GitHub makes these are like hash numbers it's like a unique identifier for that particular change so I can copy that and I can put that into my comment this changes uh and if I do a single tick by the way that makes it like code formatted changes video dot oh uh video dowith no no this dowith so hold on this is this. elt dowith back to this. el. videoi we seem to be in an endless cycle of changing this code back and forth um Can how do we how do we best resolve both of these issues um so I think um um I am making a video about this exact issue and when I upload that video I will post a link here um what else would be helpful in this GitHub issue so um just to be clear again the code that makes this issue that resolves this issue is so one thing you can do and you're going to add code into a GitHub issue is you can do three ticks and then if you want it syntax highlighted you can write the language there JavaScript and I need to grab this makes this makes this work the code that resolves um the other issue was 1274 1274 is and then I can go looks like this can we how can we resolve both what code would resolve both okay so I think now one thing I can do is I can hit preview and you can see here now I can reread this it a little bigger this particular fixed was changed back due to issue 1274 and no longer works maybe I should say you can see how this Commit This commit how the commit let me let me fix this uh this particular fix was reverted and the pixels array length is does not match the specified size anymore you can see how the commit you can see how the commit this changes this. elt dowith back to this. el. video withth we seem to be an endless cycle changes code back and forth how do we best resolve both of these issues I'm making a video about this this question I'm making a video about this question and when I upload that video I'll post a link here just to be clear code resolves this issue the code that resolves this which what code will resolve both all right I think that's good enough I'm going to hit reopen and comment and see no I'm afraid like I'm afraid someone's going to yell at me but no of course no one's going to yell at me because for the whole world should be a welcoming place but sometimes on GitHub it can feel a little intimidating or confusing I want to say again p5js is an open community that welcomes everybody whatever your level or knowledge is there is no way to post a GitHub issue incorrectly um and so we should just give it a try and somebody will will tell me if I uh if I've there's a better way I could have done it or something like that I'm going to press this button and this concludes this particular video I'm just going to check by the way because I have a live chat going this is a recording and see um if anybody uh is has any comments uh yep okay nobody has any comments so I'm going to hit stop and this concludes this video see if this follow up we'll make we'll follow up in the comments in the threads in the description if this issue gets resolved
