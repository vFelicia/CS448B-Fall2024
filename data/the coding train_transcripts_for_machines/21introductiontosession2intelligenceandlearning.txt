hello welcome to session two of nature of code intelligence and learning so I am making this video in 2017 these are videos that go along with a course that I'm teaching at New York University ITP um this video is going to be very very short um and you're here in session two so the topic for session two is evolutionary algorithms so um this uh this there will be a link to this particular readme file on GitHub which has kind of a little outline of a lot of the topics some additional reading that you could do about the topic links to various examples but mostly if you're in this playlist if you're seeing this video this is part of session two intelligence learning playlist there's going to be a lot of videos about genetic algorithms that you can watch this is a long session um there'll be there it starts with about four or five videos that just explain the idea then I go through a kind of uh a scenario known as the Shakespeare monkey scenario I don't if that makes any sense to use a genetic algorithm to evolve a monkey that could type Shakespeare it's not really what happens but something like that and then I try to take a variety of other approaches looking at something called interactive selection where the user plays a role in The evolutionary algorithm by making Fitness selections of what the user likes or doesn't like or what that sort of thing um and then also I'm going to look at um an ecosystem kind of simulation where you just have a continuous system of Agents moving around the screen that try to um try to eat food or escape from a predator and that type of thing so there's a lot of videos watch them all don't watch them all but um uh would if you get to the end there will be a video that is gives you kind of an an exercise or assignment prompt so if you get to the end and watch that video and you make something you create something please share it with me shiffman on Twitter or um uh uh in the comments here there anywhere and I look forward to seeing what you make now normally in this introductory video I might sort of introduce the topic genetic algorithms but this video was really really short because the very first uh video in this particular playlist which which should come up next to you actually does that so genetic algorithm introduction so you can just walk right into that video I don't know if you walk into a video but you can go right to that next video where I'll actually talk about what a genetic algorithm is and how it can be applied okay thanks for watching this short video that I don't know if it ever will actually exist but I'm making it so maybe if you're watching it then it does exist okay see you soon
