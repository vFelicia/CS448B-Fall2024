okay I'm back this is my friend the tentacle uh it's a quite a nice friendly tentacle I feel like you hopefully could make something where the tentacle is a bit more colorful maybe it has some cute eyes and it smiles and it reaches for an apple and then hands it to somebody else cuz somebody else could use an apple and then they're going to be happy you go and do all that stuff what I'm going to do in this video is I want to take all this gobbledygook uh all this code that is in the main program here and I want to put it in an object and I kind of did this before I want to put it in an object in order to um why do I want to do this ah because I want to make more than one of these tentacle things so right now I have this organizational structure where there's a segment and a segment is one piece of a tentacle the tentacle is an array of segments so I actually want to make a tentacle object which has that array so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a new tab I'm going to call it tentacle and this is going to be the easy part I'm going to say class tentacle boy I'm having like a crazy Deja Vu here and what I'm going to do is I'm say ah what is a tentacle it needs these three things it needs an array it needs a base and it needs a length for the segments and obviously you can vary that to your heart's content I'm going to take all of this stuff and put this in the Constructor for this object for this class whoops so now when I make it I create all this stuff and ah this is going to be really good because what I'm going to do is I'm going to when I make the Constructor I'm going to be able to set its base I don't know why I'm putting this first but so the idea is the tentacles are all the same now I could give it more this you should do right I should give the I'm going to make a tentacle and say how many segments the length of the segments your color I could I could vary it in a lot of ways but I'm going to keep things simple here then what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at all this code and I'm pretty sure basically everything is kind of can go in an update function so I'm just putting everything I could separate out some of this logic but I'm doing the thing where I have it follow the mouse and then I have it um what do I have it do after that I uh then I update all its locations then I like set it backwards to its base I do all that and then I'm going to write a function and I'm going to call it show and it just iterates through the array and show this is a place where I could use an enhanced Loop people like it when I discuss different kinds of Loops so I'm going to say tentacle T in tentacle and I kind of want to call this segments because I think it's a little confusing to call that tentacle so I'm going to change that also I'm gonna try something kind of crazy uh and I'm gonna say t doow okay let's just see if this works well whoops uh what did I do here I think I messed something up oh this is a segment see this is why it's so confusing I've got to be really clear about this right every segment s this is why I want to change so I'm going to run this and now I'm going to refactor this in a second I'm going to show you something kind of cool that I think you can do in processing now so I'm going to now make a tentacle tentacle T I really should have thought of something besides tentacle tentacle I'm going to give it a base width divided by two height then I'm just going to say uh t. update and t. show and now I have a single one of this is just the same exact code but I have now refactored it so this tentacle lives um somewhere else it lives in um it all the code lives inside an object now what did I want to show you here's the thing I really don't like that I re name this tentacle it's causing me to be confused because it's an array of segments I think I should just call it segments um so one thing I can do is I can go here and I can do rename look at that rename now obviously I could just click on this and type a new name but what the rename tool in processing does is it finds all the other places use that variable it's not a finding replace of the word it actually is able to look to where the variable is being used so in a comment it wouldn't change so let's hope this works re name I've never actually used this segments oh my God I don't have my D sound effect okay that's really exciting that worked that is brilliant I love that that makes me so happy okay so now I've renamed it I feel like this is a bit easier to follow okay so great goodbye no there's more um what I want to do now is I don't know what I want to do exactly but let's try I don't know what's going to be interesting kind of want to put them in a pattern what if I put them all around the edges of a a circle that's kind of crazy so what if I made an array list of tentacle objects do I really have to call this tentacles I think I do and tentacles is a new array list of tentacle and I am not going to add anything right now or do anything I'm going to comment this out so what I want to do is I want to say four I'm going to use I'm G I'm going to make a little circle a equals 0 a is less than uh 2 pi A+ equals uh 2 pi let's let's let's see let's the how what's our change in angle is 2 pi divide let's have 10 of them divided by 10 this is like a weird idea that I'm doing no idea if this is going to be any good you're going to have a much more creative idea of how why you want to do this um and then I'm going to say give me an X give me an x and x is the center of the screen plus cosine of that angle times 100 so I'm just going to place all these points around a circle and a y is the center of the screen plus sign of the angle a height divided by two and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say tentacles push a new tentacle at X comma y so I just use again that same polar to cartisian thing to get all the points around a circle I'm using that pearly noise and polar to cartisian I need little that's all I ever do I guess basically and it's not push because that's JavaScript with an array list it's add and then now I can go down here and I can say for every tentacle te in tentacles and I can get my update and show whoops update and showback and I can run this and you can see whoa look at this so I got all these tentacles starting and they're all following the mouse now this is kind of interesting I think there's probably a lot of possible ways you could expand on this um one idea I have first of all is to not have them follow the mouse I could have them follow a plin noise moving thing I could oscillate their end points really what I probably would want to do is give them each their own thing to follow that's kind of around the edges depending on what side they are I think I might want to stop here now I kind of this is uh um but I do think it's worth kind of noting actually what we could do is um and and actually I think this might be more interesting if the tentacles themselves were not so long um so I'm going to make them actually only have 10 segments right and that's they're still quite they're still quite good uh I don't know what this this looks like something I I kind of want also them to uh maybe be further apart right so you can see this I don't know what I've done here I almost want now I also want to draw I don't know what I'm making I want to draw an ellipse just want to be able to see the sort of circle which is 400 by 400 so oh and I've I guess I better say no fill there's probably and there's probably a clever way I could constrain them so you can see what I'm doing here you could imagine this is the beginnings of the design of some creature now since they're all pointing towards the mouse you're getting a very uh kind of specific thing it looks kind of like a spiderweb kind of like noodles um but one thing since we said robot arm let's get them to try to pick up something and I want to make it appear a bit more um obvious what I'm doing so I'm going to make the length of these 50 and I'm going to give them just four segments um so now you can see they're much more robot arm like and actually I just I don't know what I'm doing exactly but I just want to have five of them let's try that okay and maybe I'll let them even be a little bit longer like what if I give them I'm losing my mind here because there's really no point to what I'm doing okay so what I want to do is I'm going to create I'm going to just say let's make let's make a particle and I should really make this an object but I'm just going to give it a position and position equals new P Vector uh P Vector um I'm going to just start it in the I'm going to start it at 0 0 and I'm also going to make a velocity and I'm going to say velocity is a new P Vector which points but you know two comma 1.3 just to give it something arbitrary and I'm going to say now position. add velocity and I'm going to um uh position. add velocity and I'm going to draw a little circle at position dox this is going to be the Apple position dox position doy 16 imagine this I guess I could make it kind of green a green apple would it be like I don't know is that a color of an apple um so I'm going to do this you can see there's my apple and I'm going to say no stroke and I'm going to make it a little bit bigger and there's the Apple you can see it moving along so what I want to do now is have these arms fall follow the apple and I I feel like the Apple should I want to give it gravity and have it bounce around oh there's so much stuff that I want to do that I'm not going to do but I will I will um have it move a little bit faster so now what I need to do is just say okay if uh position dox is greater than WID or positionx is less than zero we're just going to make it bounce velocity dox multiply it by negative 1 and then we'll do the same thing with why because uh because why not um and then we will we're going to add gravity to this because we have to um so now we can see there's the Apple it's moving very slowly Let's uh increase its velocity by three times so you can see so let's see it should move it should bounce oh oh what did I have I have a mistake ah greater than height uh it didn't bounce off the bottom so let's see if that Apple it's going to head towards the bottom it's going to bounce around so why am I doing this is because now I can have my tentacles follow that particle so you can see they're all trying to kind of grab it and I don't know whether they're throwing it or passing it or whatever but you can kind of see what's going on I feel like it's sort of the positioning of it is kind of weird I think it actually this would be more interesting if they were positioned all along the edges and also if the ball did something a little bit more interesting like if it um actually had some a force like uh gravity and if I said uh gravity uh is a new P Vector that points you know down by some amount and then the velocity always changes by the gravity and then also I should probably this is going to cause a problem I should also say if pause. Y is greater than height this is a little thing that I'm going just scooch it back onto the screen because it kind of get stuck um I don't see the gravity happening here why not or is it just so weak yeah it's I think it's there it's also we don't need the um we don't need to actually check it up if there's gravity I don't need to check the top anymore so this is why this is what I meant to do I can just scooch it back on when it hits the bottom so uh come back so you can see it's bouncing and I could add some dampening let's add some dampening I'm really off in like physics land here for no good reason you everyone's probably stopped watching this video by now no one's going to see my end screen oh that's so much dampening um so I can add a little dampening so it kind of like slows and you know what would make sense is only have the dampening happen when it hits the bottom so maybe that would make more sense okay so you get the idea but oh yeah and um probably apples in the chat there's actually a person named probably apples in the chat says I might be wrong I yeah I don't just spitballing here who knows I mean just might be wrong but I don't think this is probably Apple's voice it's my voice but probably apples don't bounce around like that and I think that's a very good point so uh I I almost feel like this will be more interesting to watch if there were only two of them and if they were further apart so hold on just bear with me for a second what I'm going to do is where do I make the tentacles I'm going to have just two of them and I'm going to make this 300 this is silly because there's no point in a circle yeah so look at this now it looks like they're playing uh catch uh which they aren't but it's kind of interesting um so there you go here is my inverse kinematics robot arms playing catch with an apple on the coding train I really want to say a special thank you again to Keith Peters and coding math um these examples are are really essentially exactly the same as the examples that are right here and you know what I'm realizing I better show this one because I think I'm getting this idea I I know I'm getting this idea from exactly this so this is Keith Peter's example that is in the processing I didn't I my code is quite different because mine is an object in objectoriented fashion but this is there and you can see there's some variations um in terms of segments uh and how they're working so um um uh there's great suggestion to the chat I could do things about constraining the angles I could make them not interceptable there's lots of things I could expand this I could think about design um there's so many possible things that I could do to expand this but so thank you check out the coding math Channel if you want to see somebody who knows what they're doing about math and coding that's a channel you should watch great examples great inspiration and you can see here um we have our robot arms playing catch thanks very much and I'll see you in a future episode of the coding train
