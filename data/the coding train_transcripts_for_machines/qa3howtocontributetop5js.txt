hello and welcome to another Q&A uh creative coding video in this video I'm going to answer a question from Michelle Michelle writes on helping with P5 development I'm still Beery but is there a way I can contribute to it I was thinking about contributing to the inline examples might be a way VIA this page and there's a link to a particular page that I'll show you in a minute or there's certain examples which might be a good one to keep in mind as a reference okay so you're asking the question let's say Michelle is asking a question I'm going to generalize the question a bit more I I like P5 I'm interested in it how can I contribute so the first thing I want to say is that um there is a wonderful set of video tutorials that are being created by Louisa Pereira um and they are called looking inside P5 and you can see there's part one and there's also a part two she also has both of these tutorials in Spanish so they're both in English and in Spanish now I would play it for you right now but you can go the links will be in this video's description and you can go and watch them on your own but what's wonderful about these video tutorials is they kind of explain to you this is let's say you want to contribute to p5js this is where you will land this is the GitHub repository page for p5js github.com processing p5js there's all this stuff there's a source folder and a lib folder and a doc folder in this build task and test how is this organized how does it all work Louisa does a wonderful job of going through all of these things in her tutorial videos so rather than do that here I'm going to refer you to those particular videos and what I'm going to do here is show you a bit about how you might other places and how you might sort of get involved so one thing is is is um the first thing that you can do is just kind of go and look at some of the wiki pages so here um you might look through there's some tutorials and different things but there one thing that I would look at here first is this development Wiki so this development Wiki uh gives you a nice kind of set of ideas and things about what you can do in order to get started started getting um contributing so you can look through the GitHub issues there's links to that here you could think about implementing a new feature there's lots of stuff here there's instructions of what you need to do to set up and download it some of this stuff might look a little bit intimidating or a little bit scary but p5js is a friendly and open place it doesn't matter what your skill level is we want you to contribute we want you to help so come and give it a try and see where you get stuck send me a tweet um post on the processing forums there's various plac where you can uh where you can get help I also have a bunch of video tutorials about GitHub that you could take a look at now uh Michelle had asked Michelle had pointed out this particular uh this particular wiki page which is called the development checklist and the development checklist is kind of a checklist oh I wish I had looked at this for my webg video earlier but you can sort of see here are a bunch of things that are kind of in progress or being developed that you can think about contributing to and one of the things that you can look at that she had noticed here okay I'm gonna find it more quickly is the uh uh inline uh inline exam okay wait hold on what am I looking at here sorry reference sketches sorry so these are sketches and things that are for the reference now you can see that some of them are not crossed out meaning they haven't been done yet ID class so let's look at how that works and I'll show you a little bit about how you might do this so oh these aren't links um so let's say you want to um create something for the um the ID function in P5 Dawn how would you do that so let's go and I'm going to show you actually I'm going to go to p5js I'm going to go here to source and actually I just realized this is all the source for all the stuff that's in the P5 JS Library itself and all gets compiled together into that big p5js library but the P5 Dom function the P5 Dom library is actually different and it's right here in lib Addam addons p5.js so you can see here is actually all of the source code for p5.js now I what I want to do is go back to that development checklist ah it's not showing up if I H there we go that's what I wanted it to show up and let's look back um under Dom and we can see that for example uh position is implemented so right here we can see that position is implemented so I'm going to look for the position function uh so I can see actually this is the source code for the position function in P5 Dom so what position does is it takes a Dom element and gives it an absolute position on the page I don't have my I'm not looking at my chat and I'm worried that something's not working okay so um now here is the source code for it but up here is a quick little example create a canvas and call canvas doos and look how this is formatted it's formatted at example with a div with code class equals no render because the code isn't rendered or maybe it should be rendered I don't know and then uh close code tag close div tag so I'm going to go here and just going to copy paste this so now what I'm going to do is I'm let's look for the ID function so I'm going to look for ID equals equals function I got to find it oh you know why it's not here Tricky Tricky Tricky back I couldn't find the function that I want to edit here in p5.js and actually what I didn't realize is the function ID is a function that assigns a specific ID to a Dom element and it's not actually in the p5.js function sorry addon it because it comes with core P5 it's actually part of core P5 and for that I need to go to source and then um I'm looking for P5 core p 5. element. JS and here it is so I want to look for ID equals whoops ID equals and now here's that function and you'll notice that function does not have an example so let's just do this right now we're going to live on YouTube on the air make an example and submit a poll request am I logged in well I'm logged in as shiffman that's going to be a bit of a problem uh that's fine uh so I'm going to hit edit cuz I have uh privileges to make changes so I have to make sure so now I want to look for ID equals and I'm going to go right here and I'm gonna paste that in ah I lost it so hold on I gotta I got to get back to uh lib addons P5 D and I'm going to search for uh what was one that we liked uh position position here it is I got to get this example stuff right here I'm going to go back here and now I'm going to zoom in here so you can see what I'm doing I'm going to paste this in here o so I need to fix this so that the spacing is right you know I could be more thoughtful about this uh and then I need to make sure this is closed so now you can see I've added the code for an example but this is the code for the position so what I want to do is do make give it an ID and I'll make that ID my canvas and then what this does is uh I'll already assigns a CSS selector ID to the canvas element so I don't know if anybody so this is now adding a quick little example that shows you how you can use the ID function and then all oh there's German going on in the chat now um and then uh I'm going to go down to the bottom and I want to create a new branch and start a pull request so adding uh inline example for ID function and I'm going to write I'm Live on YouTube demonstrating how to make a poll request and add add an inline uh inline uh example so once I do that I'm going to click propose file change and there's some guidelines for contributing that I could click at and I want to see uh and I'm going to create this uh this you can see my change is just in this one P5 do element it adds just this code and I'm going to say create pull request and it's going to do some checks to make sure things are okay and we'll see on Thursday this Thursday's coding rainbow the uh there will be a mystery we will discover was this poll request merged or was it not merged stay tuned to be continued oh I need a sound effect for D D um is that uh okay I won't look for that right now okay so again I kind of went off in a little bit of tangent of showing you a very specific thing but basically what you uh the P5 as an environment is designed to be both something that beginners can use to learn to program and also can learn to contribute to an open source environment and the place to do that first is GitHub the problem with GitHub is it doesn't appear that friendly to you so I would encourage you to check out the wikis in the development page I would encourage you to tweet at P5 xjs on Twitter to post um on the processing forum uh forum. processing.org and you can go down to the um p5js uh and here p5js development questions if you post to there and are looking for help on how to contribute post there send me a tweet so I can look at your post and help answer it um as well as I'd recommend checking out Louisa's videos and also something you can just literally do to be a part of the the contributions is go to the issues page this is the issues page read through some of the issues scan through them if there's something that you think should be a feature something you're not sure about if it works correctly contribute write an issue file an issue do not worry about filing an issue correctly you incorrectly you cannot file it incorrectly the act of filing an issue is the act of filing it correctly and if there's ways if you need to close the issue and reopen a new one all of that is possible and fine so please come and join and contribute to p5js and um yes dramatic chipmunk that's the name of the sound effect I'm looking for um and Hope this video was somewhat useful about a little bit about how you can get started contributing to p5js thanks for watching
