hello in case you are following these videos as if you're taking a weekly course here's an assignment that you can do so one thing is the coding challenge that I just did in a way I think that's your assignment come up with a creative way to interact with individual words in a larger body of text and think about how you might use regular expressions with us so how do you match what do you what are you looking for what are you matching how are you replacing that sort of thing the other thing though you might really do is if you did the previous assignment about sort of text mashup without regular expressions or you simply did it manually your assignment would be to do that now with programming with algorithms with regular expressions I also have a few ideas here that I've written up are things you might think about you know the flesh index calculator I made as an example I didn't use regular expressions for it if you rewrote it with regular expressions that would certainly make it probably more efficient or be a good exercise and using regular expressions I'm thinking about how you could translate a text using the replace method the pirate translator which takes hello my name is Dan and turns it to do a hoary matey dan my name is you could think about using as using a regular expression to do that and also you might simply look around making a game that you play with regular expressions so the regex golf game is something you can actually play there's a regex crossword game that it's not linked here but you up try to add to the to this page that will be linked in the description of this video and yeah so you could do something like that it may be write up a blog post or something about you know how it was working with write of expressions what worked for you what didn't work for you what questions you have and I'll review those questions and things and reactions to regular expressions in next week's live stream where I also look at data okay so enjoy I hope some of you do this assignment you can share it with me in the slack if you subscribed as a patron or you can simply just tweet at me or share it in the comments here okay thanks for watching and see you soon
