hello I am making a video about speech recognition in the browser using the p5 speech library so first another thank you to the NYU ability project at the integrated digital media program at Tandon school for engineering in Luke Du Bois who created this library I've been using it I've made a lot of mistakes with it but I'm excited about it and what I'm going to show you in this video is how to do speech recognition now one thing I should say is there's some privacy concerns here anytime you're going to use the microphone in the browser so if you write the code that I'm going to write the browser will ask for permission to use the microphone you should also note that the audio that the browser is recording gets uploaded to the cloud that's where the actual speech recognition happens not locally on your machine itself it's the Google speech recognition stuff in the cloud so if you're connected to the Internet if you're not connected the internet none of this will work okay so let's get started and see how we can write some code that does this I've got a sketch with nothing in it so I'm gonna add setup I am going to add a no canvas and let me mention again that I already have included in my HTML file the p5 speech Jas library which you need to go download yourself from the github repository that's linked to in this video's description once you've done that you can then write some code that says let a speech recognizer let's just say speech rec equal new p5 speech rec ok now I can give I can do a couple things here I can give it a language because and I believe this is the default for us English so I could if I don't give it any arguments it'll set some default settings and I can also give it a callback like got speech so when I create the recorder I'm saying is I want you to listen for this language and I'll post a link to where you can see all the documented language possibilities there and actually Alka I'm gonna one thing I could do which is exciting is I could say navigator dot language so let's actually write this as a separate line of Coit code navigator dot language or enus so in other words if the browser this this would just pick up whatever this is a way of asking p5 speech recognition to just use whatever this word language is set of the browser already AHA okay then once I have this I can write this Scott speech callback and what I'm gonna do now in the got speech callback is I'm just gonna say console dot log speech rec so what I want to do is run this code it's going to listen to the microphone and then anytime it hears something oh you know I forgot something really important I have to say speech Rex tart there's a few more things I'm gonna do with this but this is start listening which is important you have to explicitly say start listening okay so let's see what happens refresh Oh navigation is not defined because it's navigate tour first you can see this red blinking microphone now because I've been doing this for a while on this computer before I started recording this video it didn't ask me for permission it already had permission and it might also because I'm doing it locally but it you will probably see that it'll ask you permission okay wait something console.log got some speech look at this confidence level so this is important it gives you a confidence level of how confident it is that it got what you said correctly 92% and then you can see here result string first you can see this red blinking microphone not because I've been doing this for a while you can see this is all the stuff that I said and there's actually a lot more information as well and the object in the result JSON so there's lots of stuff like a timestamp and more information that you could sort of dig into you know this is really this p5 speech library is a thin layer on the web speech kit library probably saying that wrong but on the web speech API so really it's just a window into that and once you're using this you might discover you want to dig deeper into that but what I could do right now is I could see what I really want is just what I said which is results string I can also look at I think there's a result value true this is kind of like was it successful or not so what I'm going to do is add to the code if speech rec result value was it successful or not then create P speech rec dot result string ok so there we go and here here come's here we go and refresh hello speech recognizer were there I should really show such coding train or something let's try this again choo choo wait all right I'm gonna hit refresh let's see what happens choo choo oh wait it said let's see what happens choo choo oh that's the greatest thing that's ever happened to my life with speech recognition awesome now you'll notice something it's not listening to me anymore so by default when you say start it's only going to listen to one thing that you say and this is good to have that by default because you don't want suddenly like all of the audio that's ever coming into this computer to be uploaded to the cloud but you can turn on something called continuous mode so I could say continuous equals true and there's actually something else called interim results which I'm gonna set at false and I'll show you what that is in a second so I could say continuous which I always felt wrong and I can say comma interim which I I always spell wrong not say I think I say continuous so I'm gonna turn on continuous mode let's see what happens whoops interim is not defined Oh interest held Ajay did spell interim run all the board choo choo chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga choo choo alright anyway you can see that this works sort of so one thing you might notice is that it waits for me to pause speaking before it gives me more data into the browser this is what interim results now the interim results is a little tricky to get to work and really you've got to investigate how the web speech API works but let me set this to true and I'll show you what I mean hello 1 2 3 how is it going four five six so you can see here that it's continuously listening and just it's continuously listening and giving me stuff and so what's great lookk in the examples in the actual p5 github repository has an example where you can drive a little drawing thing around the screen and so watch what how this works up up down down right right down up down up down so if you're listening continuously and you're listening for certain key words you could control like a pen as it's drawing onto a canvas I encourage you to try that as an exercise yourself or go or go and check out the example that does this there's a lot of other great examples on the p5 speech github repository itself so thank you Luke Dubois and the ability project and everybody else at NYU who's worked on this library it's really wonderful it's fun to play with I'm gonna do a coding challenge which I'll link to from this video where I create one of my a chat BOTS but instead of typing with the chat bot and having it display text to me I speak to the chat bot and it speaks back to me so I'm gonna use both speech recognition and texttospeech let's say texttospeech and speechtotext no speech the text is a thing no no texttospeech is a thing speech the text is speech really called speech recognition but whatever you get the point enjoy have a good day
