hello I think I am back after a break where I recorded um a couple guest tutorials with Sarah drasner and Val head those will be published sometime in the next week they're super exciting one was about Springs and p5js and one was about uh a framework that I never heard of before today called mo. JS so um if anybody's actually watching this in the chat I'm sorry I'm like very tired it's been a very long day it's about 640 p.m. I already a twohour live stream and then recorded uh two guest tutorials and I was doing office hours all morning so this has been kind of an epic adventure of a day um but I really wanted to come back because the uh coding challenge that I started earlier I ran out of time and wasn't able to finish and since I won't be doing another live stream until sometime next week I really wanted to make sure that was finished so that it could be um published Mo in the chat wants a uh shout out otherwise uh Mo will not feed Mo's baby nephew I really don't want any babies to go unfed so I'm going I'm I need to refill this water which was stupid that I didn't do that before I'm starting but let's see how I do so um I'm just going to kind of keep an eye on the chat and my battery level of the microphone um and I'm gonna get started everybody wants shout outs JIA licky wants to shout out oh Australia what time what I would like to know is what time is it has anybody watching this in the middle of the night right now it 640 p.m. I'm not doing my usual introductions that I usually do in these live streams because I did all that in the previous one I did today although probably when these get published to YouTube there'll be separate videos some of you might just be watching the beginning of this but such is life um okay so let me figure out where I was before uh here I am so this is what I ended with with Jacob's going to cry all you guys are really pulling on my heartstrings uh Jacob is going to cry all night if Jacob does not get a shout out midnight in the UK hello UK okay so um this is okay I'm gonna I'm stopping with the shout outs now I'm not g to look at the chat too much um I'm gonna finish up this tutorial so I'm gonna try to figure out where I left off so this is what I have so far I have a uh uh application that allows you to Doodle into a canvas click save and it saves your drawing to a database and then it shows all the drawings that have been saved here okay so I'm now going to Mata if you're watching this now or later um I am going to move into the part where I'm going to just sort of pretend to pick up as if this is one video I don't know how easy or hard that will be but I'm going to give that a try if it has to be um it could be two parts but I think this this will just be like one long tutorial which I think is fine oh um the sorry so um just in case people are new I didn't watch this afternoon I did two introductory Firebase tutorials um this afternoon and those have yet to be published I they were available live and now they're kind of hidden on YouTube in the archives but once those files get cleaned up and edited um there'll be the raw archive and edited versions of those that will appear online and actually something that um I really forgot to mention which is uh retrieve okay let me just once Firebase this should pull it up this I I I should have mentioned this in all of the videos but we'll put it in as a link in the descriptions but this is the reference page uh read and write data on the web so this reference page shows kind of all of the stuff for what I'm doing but there's sort of more to it in terms of all the authentication stuff which I'm totally glossing over ah I should have mentioned that again so much more things to talk about can't get to everything okay and deleting data all that sort of stuff all right I'm skipping I got somay I got to like learn This Promise stuff and do some tutorials about that okay so I'm checking out the chat hello Brazil um okay and I I ran out of water um okay uh while people are oh my God so many people have just joined while people are joining uh um I'm going to refill this water because I really do need I I should have done that before I started uh SoundCloud whoops uh system preferences uh sound multi random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between 0 and 10 1 9 48 9 2 1 3 I pick nine a lot apparently but with pearing noise I might pick numbers like this 2 3 4 3 4 5 6 5 4 5 6 7 five six 7 five 6 s 89 876 look this is like pearly noise performance art 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8 9 2 1 3 I think 2 3 4 3 4 5 6 5 4 this is like pearly noise performance 59 2 6 1 9 4 but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this okay I'm back oh did I did I actually put on the correct music I have no idea did I I I have no idea because I couldn't I can't actually hear the audio of what was playing I just funn it through the live stream so I have no idea if that was the this dot song I but we're P that now uh okay welcome to everyone who has just joined I am continuing my tutorial series from this after afternoon I'm hoping this will just take about 15 or 20 minutes um it was not sorry everyone oh well hopefully that was um Creative Commons license music wow the the my keying is really off today but what am i g to do I'm gonna move over here that should help a little bit okay so uh I am now here and Firebase console is here boy what's uh and drawings are here and okay so I'm going to go to yeah first thing I want to do is add a clear button okay okay everyone sorry I'm my brain is totally fried as I said before it's been a very long day but I really want to finish this example so I'm just going to dive right into it right now so apologies for to those of you who are just tuning in tonight this I'm continuing example I made earlier today which is a drawing web application that stores drawings in a Firebase database so you if you'll be able to go back and watch the other stuff that I'll publish from this afternoon earlier which will be the beginning part of what I'm going to do now okay so here we go okay so I'd like to add a couple more features to this web application before I finish up one is I need a button to like clear the drawing CU once there's a drawing here there's no way for me to start over a new drawing so the first thing that I want to do is just add another button and I'm going to go to uh index.html and I'll add a button I'll call it a clear button and I'll say clear and then I'm going to refresh the page we see that the clear button is there so now what I need to do is in the JavaScript code um what I need to do uh is find where I'm doing stuff with buttons and I'm going to uh use the same technique by using the P5 Dom libraries function select to select the clear button and then the clear button we'll get an event called clear drawing and remember the drawing is just this array so if I want to clear the drawing all this is like a very simple thing to do and I know I could just put an anonymous function here but for clarity I'm kind of just doing I don't know if it's actually for clarity this might be worse but I'm going to um I'm going to go Dash to the bottom of my code and write this call back function clear drawing and all I need to do there is reset the array to nothing so now uh I can uh Draw Something Right dot do dot I can hit clear I can start over smiley face I can hit clear I could load up one of these drawings I could hit clear and start over or I could load this and I could start up on it so you're starting to think there's a lot of possibilities here of some kind of Exquisite corpse style collaborative drawing editing thing so you know I don't have color don't have there's so much you could add to this if you want to like build off of this and make some sort of exciting thing I hope you do okay so now we have the clear button what's another feature I want to add well one thing that's a bit of a problem is I'm going to add another drawing I I love hearts so I'm going to just do some more Hearts I'm going to do a drawing with three hearts now watch what happens when I hit save uh it updates the list but and it's really hard to see because again if you're going to work on my work I would rename I would add a name field and add a name for all these but what you're seeing here is that um it's duplicating the whole list again when I add just one so something that I need to do and I did this in another example recently is I want to find where I'm creating that list which is right here and I want to give every one of these elements a class and I'm going to just call it uh listing so uh this I'm going to give this and this is again the P5 Dom library has a class function that gives it a listing class and then when I um when I oh oh I'm sorry I'm in the right place already so this is the part where I create that so before I create it I want to and there's probably a more efficient way to do this um because I could just sort of request from the database just anything new or I could be more thoughtful about this but I'm just going to kind of do this thing where I clear the whole list so um so I'm going to just make a variable called elt for elements and I'm going to do select all and I'm going to say do listing and then I'm going to Loop through uh all of those elements and call the P5 Dom Library function remove which removes the Dom element from the page so before I generate the list I'm going to clear it because I'm going to get all the data from the database again so now we should have I refresh the page we can see here are all my drawings and now I'm going to clear and make another drawing which I'm going to try to make a cube my kids love to draw 3D cubes it's like sort of this like fascinating thing for like little kids okay so I did that I'm going hit save and we can see now that's just there so dynamically added to the page so we really really really gotten far along in a way this is done I could say like okay well I want to do something to add a feature to edit a drawing update a record in the database delete a drawing from the database those are things I'm going to leave for you to investigate you know again all the do documentation for this is at this URL uh firebase.com and right so this is where you can see where these functions on value that sort of thing but what I want to do oh and you know what I realized I did something which I I really should probably change there's two more features one is this is the function I wrote earlier to show one individual drawing so whenever I call ref. on like I did with all the data I'm I'm tying an event to that record in the database forever so if that record ever changes this event will will trigger again and a lot of times you want that but in this case I might want to just only get the data from the database just once and I can actually change this from on to once so once will not tie that event forever but just one time so now I'm going to hit ref oh I'm I'm the wrong page I'm going to hit refresh let's hopefully this still works and you can see this still works but um if I add a drawing it'll refresh the whole thing okay so we're still almost done but something that would be really good to add to this what if I um what if what I want want to do is be is be able to share my drawing with somebody else well right now um the only way to do that is to um is to uh sort of email somebody the ID and then tell them to go to this page and click on the ID what if I could encode into the URL something like question mark ID equals my drawing and so what if each one of those drawings could have a permal link where you could share that peral link and the drawing would show up so here's how I'm going to start doing that the first thing I want to do is just create that peral link so when I'm making these listings in addition to this link that dynamically update to the drawing on the page I'm going to do exactly the same thing again and I'm going to say create a but instead I'm going to say question mark ID equals plus key that's the link and then what I wanted to say is I'm just going to say peral link and then what I'm gonna do so let's do this and we should see now oh and I need to parent it also oh and this should be I'll just call this uh Perma and I'm going to say per. parent Li so it also goes in that list and you can see now you can see now I have the this this and then also these permal links now the spacing is all off so obviously with CSS and thinking about styling and and being more thoughtful about the HTML I'm just going to do something quick which is like Perma do uh style this is a P5 Dom library for adding some CSS Styles I don't know maybe if I just add some padding will that do it make it I can differentiate between those two yeah so now I can see I have the peral link and the actual uh so this is now showing me the drawings and now if I click on one of these it goes to the page but the drawing does not show up but look what happens it Ur it creates a URL query string with ID equals this so I can have the page read that URL query string how do I do that well there's lots of ways you could do it but since I'm using the p5js framework there is a p5js function for this so I'm going to go to the pgs. org reference oops that's the website reference and I'm going to have to look for this uh URL ah so get URL pams so there's three functions here but I can actually just get the parameters that are on the page in an object so if I look at the reference for this all I need to do is call get URL param so I'm going to do that in setup so I'm going to come back here to setup and uh I'm gonna say uh well I'm goingon to do this right at the beginning actually and I'm gonna say pams equals get URL pams with this right and I'm just going to say console.log params so I'm going to go back to the page uh here I am into the the code I'm going to open up the console so I can see it I'm going to hit refresh and you can see this is what came in an object with a field ID which is the key from the database that's all I needed perfect right so um um and you can see that if I delete that from the URL path and just go I'm getting an empty object so what I can actually do here is I can say if Pam's ID exists if that object has an ID then um what do oh first of all this has got to happen you know this has got to happen after I connect to the database so I'm going to do this down here and then didn't I already have a function that's like show drawing right this shows a drawing for a particular key now here's the thing I kind of I should probably give this an argument um so I'm going to put argument here so if I already have the key if I don't have the key right this is a way of having a function optionally take an argument so on the one hand it's an event that comes from that link and it gets the key from the Dom element but I can also just call that function with a key so I can say if I don't have the key then key equals this otherwise though if I just create it with the key and so where do I do that in in in uh I'm sorry in setup right so much scrolling right here if I have an ID I can just say now show drawing with with pam. ID so this should now and let's let's see if this works let's do console.log pam. ID so make sure that this actually goes here so let's just look to the I'm now loading it and it's empty so I don't see anything and I can still oops um all right first argument was an invalid path so I messed up that function somehow let's see uh what happened here um oh you know what it must have arguments when it's as the call back so this didn't work what a nice idea let's um Let me let me actually figure this out and I'm this would make this video a little bit longer but I think it's going to be worth it let's look at the arguments array you can always say arguments to look at what are the arguments for a function in JavaScript whether you've specified them as actual um parameters in the function definition or not so what I want to do is do this click on here ah so the argument it passes it a mouse event so um and uh so the first element is a the mouse event so I can probably say something like if key is not an inst is an instance of this is really silly what I'm doing when I could just write a separate function but um let's see if this works I don't know if that actually is going to work if key is an instance of a mouse event uh let's see what happens there uh oh that worked so what I'm doing now is I'm check I'm using the I'm repurposing the same function for two different uses on the one hand I want to be able to call the function with a key on the other hand I want this function just to happen as part of a mouse pressed event and key when I call it with a key will actually be a key otherwise it might be a mouse event so I'm going to override Whatever It Is by getting it from HTML fit so now we can see I've got the blank object and everything works but I can now go to the peral link which refreshes the page and gets that because the key comes in peral link so every time I refresh this page it comes up with that particular drawing and I could once again oh I'm going to say that again every time I refresh the page it could come up with that drawing and I could add something to it like it could make this a weird alien face or something and I'm going to hit save and now I have all these drawings here are all my drawings I could click on and let me make this a little smaller so you can see them I can click on all the drawings and I have a peral link to all these drawings so how do I control click or option click it'll open in a new no command click it'll open in in a new tab so I'm command clicking on all of these and we can see there's separate pages oop that load these drawings from the database automatically so this really brings us to the end of this tutorial this is a p5js sketch that allows users to create their own drawing uh you I can write a message to you all thank you I was going to try to write thank you for watching and that's going to take me way too long plus my doodling Mouse handwriting is is terrible uh thank you I can make a drawing I can hit save it adds it to the database I can on the same page click between the drawings and I can also get a Perma link so this page anytime I refresh the page starts with that drawing and I could obviously make a separate page I could make a here's what you should do if you're watching this and want to do an exercise grab this code it'll be in the description linked uh the code for this will be linked on GitHub obviously you'll have to create your own Firebase database I'll probably take out the keys I guess but um rework this to make a separate view that shows like a gallery of all the drawings and you know there's been a lot of wonderful collaborative drawing applications on the web I'm thinking of um Aaron coin's sheep Market I think I'll link to that in this video's description as well as you can see as a kind of nice um uh inspiration for this kind of project so uh thank you for watching and I don't know if this this might end up being a long video I've lost my bell but that concludes the databit p5js sketch for saving a drum drawing into a database and having a gallery of drawings example if you make something with this please share it with me on Twitter shiffman uh please share a link in the comments ask your questions in the comments and uh look forward to seeing you in another video tutorial soon okay bye bye okay um how was that everybody um um that was okay yes any questions so it is 700 p.m. I have live stream for a total almost two and a half hours today which is quite a bit but I do need to get going um in the next 10 or 15 minutes but um I would be happy to try to answer one or two uh questions in the chat it's very hard for me to like read the chat especially when it's got a lot of people in it but I'll try to keep an eye on it um but while I am waiting I will also just mention again um I want to mention to you guys the processing Fellowship ship since I'm here applic uh processing Foundation is a nonforprofit organization that I work with to um um that develops processing and p5js like it has a wonderful mission statement uh um I'm I'm like too tired to like explain everything about the processing Foundation but we're running a fellowship program and you can read information about it on the website processing foundation.org fellowships uh it comes with a stien to work on a project in the spring so check that out I'm going to look at the questions now uh um I have my own YouTube programming channel can I use this same format as video as you are using also on my channel I don't see why not I don't have any ownership over this idea of using a green screen um so if I can inspire people to think about making V programming tutorials I think that's great and I encourage you to do so um oh do a video showing your studio you know this is like the most requested thing and I keep forgetting to do this so I don't know how to remember or when to carve out the time to do this but you guys should all keep asking me about that I'm looking at the chat it's nice to see all these lovely messages of support I really really appreciate it I'm just checking um my phone here um ah so people are asking about translating the videos so um and also there's a question of where did I learn so let me answer both these questions one is I learned to program a couple different times I did actually learn when I was a kid in middle school I I programmed a little bit in basic and I used the logo programming language Turtle Graphics language this was kind of like in the 80s um and I then really started programming when I became a student at ITP so that's it. n.edu and edu and that's the program where I teach right now um I first discovered processing there uh when um through uh JT nemoy who did a workshop on one of the the first public workshops on processing at ITP in 2003 and also Amit pataro who taught a class called code and me at ITP and those were some of the first instances of processing and then I started like working with processing from from seeing their work and just never stopped um what do you recommend to start with what programming language this is um oh this is a great question I don't have an answer for it so the answer is whichever one looks good to you um I think doing JavaScript is great because you can publish your stuff on the web really quickly python is a super friendly language uh processing has tons of video tutorials that I've made and is a great Community especially if you're interested in art and visual design and processing is built on top of java so all of these things I think are great choices but really if you've just found one that you like and you found a tutorial or a book or a friend who's willing to teach and work with you then that's the one you should use um um oh oh translating and captions I know I'm sorry that I'm missing some of your questions and I will try I apolog olog for that but I one day I'll get a system for maybe getting these things submitted in advance then I can kind of read through and moderate them better so one thing I'll mention on YouTube is you can um I don't know how to oops pull this up I'm going to open up my channel but um if you're looking for um so this is me live right now if you're looking for a way to contribute um or you have a way that I could actually even like pay for this kind of service in a kind of reasonably priced way I would love to have all of my videos captioned in English um to make them more accessible as well as translated to other languages and you as a user can actually submit captions online and I have a link I'll put it in this video um I think if you're on a video there's a place I have it enabled where you can just I don't want to look for it right now where you can just add a caption um so uh and YouTube has an interface for you doing that so please if you want to do that you all have permission to do that I mean I'm getting the benefit of that so you might thank you for volunteering but I also don't want to ask too much of people's time just to volunteer and do something for me for free so if you think you want to spend a lot of time doing this and want to get in touch I figure out a way to do that what that makes sense too but I definitely take voluntary uh contributions um ah watched your giit videos how do I merge branches with conflicts very very very very very very carefully um there's not really I don't really have a great answer to that I definitely need to do a video sort of demonstrating that um when I have a conflict what I do is I actually open up the files manually in a text editor and I kind of like just go through it manually do my detective work to figure out what went wrong and they'll usually show you here's code it'll be like there'll be these weird like lots of like dashes and extra characters that are part of the indicating there's a merge conflict here and if you edit that file and clean it up and then do another uh commit that's kind of the way I work there are tools that help help you with this but that's generally the way I do it um um if you one were to translate what series do you recommend I guess I prefer people to start with the beginner series that I have and my beginner playlists are um these JavaScript ones one through six and then these as well and then the learning processing ones so a lot of these have been captioned already um but any of these I'm you know it's kind of if one interests you and you feel like watching it then you might as well translate it uh or caption it and English don't you know translating is great but it often the reason why I ask for English captions is it also makes the translator's job so much easier if there're already English captions so if I could get everything English captioned then people can translate it more easily um oh I did so um dyslexic clama I don't have no idea if I'm now asks can you do a GitHub for beginners video I have that so right here I I wish I had a better way for people to find my videos but here on my uh Channel I have G and GitHub for poets and these are total beginner introductions to get in GitHub you don't need to know anything about it whatsoever and I have more to do but you can see these are these are some of my lesser watched videos um so that I'm certainly encourage you to watch that um have you made a tutorial on how to install p5js that's a great question Scott um this is a tricky question because unlike processing which really is a desktop application that you run um even though it also processing is also just a library for Java p5js is just a library for JavaScript so there's actually nothing to in install because you can code it in any text editor coding environment whatsoever um let me go to the p5js homepage and show you what I mean by that so if I go to download this download will U will download all of the library files and an example project but will not come with a code editor so this example project is something that you just need to open in Sublime Text Adam editor text edit notepad anything and then run like a wet web server to like see the result in your browser and I have a couple videos that demonstrate how to do that on a Mac at least and you'll find tutorials also on the p5js uh wiki page there's a website and wiki page for running a local server if you Google like local server p5js those will probably come up you can also get the individual Library files and then there is also an actual editor so this is an editor that you can download and run as an application and it will have it will sort of like make your project for you and has a little play button that will launch like a little browser window but don't get you should not be misled by the fact that uh you don't need this to do JavaScript programming but this is a place that makes it easier to get started I'll also mention that coming soon we're going to release a web editor you just go right to a website sign up for an account and write p5g code right on in a browser itself so that's that's come kind of coming soon and phasing out some support of this desktop editor until we've got a web better in shape and maybe we can return back to it um so that's kind of my answer to that question you can also use codepen I think I did a tutorial about codepen in p5js at one point and there's lots of other um web editors as well um I do have a cellular automata Conway Game of Life video already um I would love to do that again though um so uh okay so it's um I tend to use adom editor um sometimes I use Sublime and I use the p5js editor I use everything I I I love the processing IDE I mean you can't do JavaScript you can do JavaScript in it so here's another way you could do it h let's let me show this to you real quick quick because Ben fry made this and this is going to take me a minute because I think I want to make sure I have the latest processing I don't think I do I really I can't bear I cannot bear to um I cannot bear and by the way processing is a nonforprofit foundation so feel free to uh we'd love to if you're if you're able to to donate to help support fund these projects um to processing which will prompt you when you go to download I'm going to download um this version and let's see oh it's coming in real fast um oh brackets is great too sorry that's a great example of a of an editor I've used that as well um okay so I'm going to show you something that was um you should thank Ben benor Fry on Twitter for this wonderful thing that he did uh which I have actually not tried yet so this is exciting and I probably should make this like a video tutorial but I'm too tired it'll just be found here in the archive of this live stream um so I'm going to move this to the desktop here replace and I'm going to run the latest version of processing I have no idea what's going to happen this is exciting ah yes I want to open this so processing by the way is a Java uh is a uh there's so much to say about processing processing.org I'm too tired to talk anymore okay so I'm gonna open up actually I'm not going to open up an example I'm going to go here processing has modes so you can actually in processing which is Java based it also has a python mode which allows to write your code in python as an Android mode which allows you to publish your processing sketches to Android and I'm going to add this add modee P 5gs mode so this is another way you can work on p5js sketches I'm going to add this mode and hopefully it'll install I hope this works I'm going to switch to p5js mode and look at this it already put in function and draw oh it has an index on HTML this is amazing oh my God _ Fry on Twitter this is awesome uh I'm going to just write some code create canvas 400400 and uh uh background zero ellipse um actually you know what I'm going to get I'm just gonna I'm going to just go copy paste something so I'm going to get my pho taxes Pho taxes example um which is under coding challenges in my GitHub repo uh challenges Pho taxes p5js whoops uh sketch. JS raw let me copy paste this copy paste this here hit save uh Pho I'm just going to put this on the desktop testing p5js mode and now I'm going to run this what happens when I hit play look at that that is fantastic so it may runs a little L local server and if I were to do something like just to change something real quick like let's um I don't know change the size of these ellipses and give them a little bit of Alpha and hit save if I refresh this yeah and now there you go so who hopefully I'm not hypnotizing everything so that's great I should use this more in like video tutorials um this is fun what happens if I have an error it's worked somehow I don't know maybe I didn't hit save I'll have to investigate this more but that's so great to see okay so um now it's been a half an hour I've been over two and a half hours today I do need to get home and get some sleep I have two classes doing their final project presentations I probably have a zillion emails from students with questions so I'm going to take a look at those and get home thanks for tuning in everything that I did today will be um published um will be published on my channel so subscribe if you want alerts about that um it'll come in the next week I expect to do a live stream again next week but I don't know what day yet and I will announce these things on Twitter at shiffman and I also do have an email list that I sometimes send announcements too um which you can sign up for at coding rainbow.com and of course if you also want to support the work that I'm doing absolutely only if you feel so inclined I do have a a patreon that you're welcome to uh subscribe to if you feel so inclined but I'm just glad that you're watching and that you're here and maybe if you give some feedback whether it's good or bad in a in a nice and constructive way I also appreciate that okay so um I will see um I will see okay so I'm going to answer three quick questions I plan to do neural network tutorials this spring my studio is not in my office uh at NYU I teach at at pp. n.edu it's here at the school for poetic computation which is an independent Artist Run school called sfpc doio if you're in the New York City area the show of the students work is actually happening this weekend so you should come and check it out and what version of processing.js does Khan Academy use so I'm not exactly sure about this KH Academy has their own staff of developers who handles this stuff I'm pretty sure they use something called processing.js I know that's very confusing this was a project started originally by John Rig and it's another it's a JavaScript version of processing that actually has hooks in it to autot translate your processing code to to JavaScript um I don't know if they're shifting to p5g I'm curious I'd be curious about that as well the both of them both environments are great and and I know that processing.js has worked really well for them okay uh GitHub is a great place for code challenges okay I am 43 years old Okay so so I answered all these questions and now I am going to say goodbye I will play you out with my cringeworthy uh intro video and I will see you all next week okay and I hope to see you someday in a live stream or in a video or in a comment or on Twitter sometime and maybe I'll meet you in person and give you some stickers okay goodbye did you think that learning coding would be really rough thr your hands up in the air and say enough enough do you want to learn to code and make some awesome stuff learn that anyone can when you're cing with on whether you're a pro or this is all brand new learn the overarching concepts and some fun stuff too and with Dan is your guide come along for the ride on make a crazy pixel mirror to reflect your face you can make a jump to light speed into outer space you can generate a maze that can go on for days you can make your own terrain and some purple rain you can make a retro game to see how it's done and then tweak a piece to make it yours for everyone make some fract trees or Twitter Bots if you please and when the Seas own you can make them your own ride the colors of code you can follow the road to
