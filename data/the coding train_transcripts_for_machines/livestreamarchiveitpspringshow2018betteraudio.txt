oh okay hello I think we're live maybe if your watch seeing this type something into the chat so that it'll scroll by my name is Dan welcome to a special where's that sound coming from episode of the coding train at the ITP show woohoo this is something of a tradition now so it's it's right now it is about 250 p.m. Eastern Time the ITP show doesn't officially start until 400 which is an hour from now but we're gonna walk around and look at projects and guess what I'm not holding the camera all of you who have there you saw you got an image of dahveed there real quick who has graciously volunteered to hold the camera so that most of these live streams it's just been a total disaster of me like dropping the camera having it spin around so I bit the bullet I wanted to just do this all by myself and thank you dahveed for volunteering to hold the camera I should also note that this microphone is nothing that you're recording secondary audio because later I will make an edited version of this with like a highlight reel of projects and also use this particular audio from this mic and zoom recorder so you don't hear anything Mike it's just quiet yeah so well I think it's gonna can you mi can you reasonably hear me somewhat they can hear but it's low there it's low I don't know if there's too much that can be done about that is there okay we're gonna so the audio might be problematic but it's just gonna be the best it is but I will oh so let me mention a couple other things one is if you happen to be watching this not live you can look in this video's description and there'll be time codes and links to all the projects that hopefully we're gonna walk around and see and then if you're watching this as an archive and you're like I don't want to watch this twohour or however long it turns out to be thing State there should also be at some point soon an edited version with nicer audio because I'm separately recording audio into this mic and I just want to make sure I'm really recording I'm really recording I'm really recording okay so let's uh come on let's go this way well you don't need to run terrifying all right so the show is barely just begun oh let's come over here and play this Lucas can we look at your project so first first can you say your name and just tell us a few sentences about what you made and you could take a minute to finish we're getting everybody early my name is Lucas Cheung I made a interactive video game called rocket slinger it was meant to teach people about orbital dynamics and yeah take a look okay can I try to play it please do okay I'm gonna put this microphone how can I hand you this microphone you can talk into it if you want okay so we built a physical controller it measures angle and velocity and the input device is a hinge that is attached to this box and as well as a pinball plunger it's plywood and there's a there's a pipe there at the software oh so the graphics are all rendered using p5.js and with some of the physics and collisions being made using Madara Jas I love the little particle versus yeah it's just as satisfying to crash the Rockets as it is to uh I'm really trying to do it I'm just terrible at it alright awesome Thank You Lucas okay all right all right eat I can we take a look at your project here yes so first come close to this camera so people can hear you no it's not that the audio for the live stream the audio for the live stream isn't so great but this is recording better audio so tell us your name and about your project okay my name is ty my project is Paulie note which is a sequencer a webbased multiplayer sequencer it is playing now and it's clean do you want to start making something yeah sure let's do it okay so it's it's now on the touchscreen so you can like do something like this and these are different instruments that you kind of pick and then you can put them on the world here so the color and the shape to find the instrument yes the color and the shape is the instrument and the velocity determine the height determines the amplitude so the volume of each tone so let's say I want this now this this shape is my favorite so I will just tap on the screen here and now I've added this that's at another another one yeah and it's completely a multiplayer so what happens here is going to be here the same pattern and we can play together anything like that yeah amazing fun a lot of fun what tools did you use to build them this is in JavaScript two libraries specifically three Jas and tone Jas for the music wonderful great job what's it has anybody done anything that really surprised you yeah with it yes it's it's it's it was fun because I was kind of playing like doing crazy stuff like putting stuff like without even thinking what's gonna be and then someone came earlier yesterday and he was like okay I'm gonna use this as a base and he just layered the baseline and then created the melody and it was like wow you totally got it it was amazing great thank you so much thank you let's see where we can what's what's going on over here can we can we check out both of your projects we'll come back to you in a minute Eric okay you're setting up we'll come back okay five minutes that's all right let's let's go around this way let's go over here well don't pick I think we got a soundrelated project here are you are you are you are you operational okay you're operational excellent all right we found an operational project okay oh boys we're gonna have an issue with the headphone project no I just the live viewers won't be able to hear but I will I can maybe narrate what's happening I'll talk to ya what's that right oh go inside here all right I got to know what just happened what just happened so hopefully you just have to tell me your name hi my name is Brandon hopefully you just had a moment we're trying to sort of show that partying is not just a silly way to escape but actually something serious a way to find community a way to find identity and create a set of norms that sort of stand in opposition to the ones that we are told we have to live by in everyday life so the piece is called 500 to 900 so yeah and hopefully you can realize that with just what we've made here that you know partying is just a state of mind and you can even bring it with you to your 900 to 500 I want to come back and see when this room is totally full of people to see to see what it's like yeah yeah but if you do have you had multiple people in the dancing so on so people people get in there sometimes with strangers sometimes with friends or parents and you know they they put on a good show what and what are you writing here I'm writing about partying I'm where I'm doing recent serious research here we have like a variety of books that went into the making of the piece and yeah I'm just sort of part of the performance here showing the contrast inside and out all right cool great job thanks for hanging okay I hope everybody enjoyed that my little time embarrassing myself as much as possible okay let's see where no no nope nope oh all right Eric is ready okay wonderful so it's a little dark over here but I think we could see you so can you tell me your name even though I know it but for the viewing audience and tell give us a few sentences about your project okay so my name is Terry Gutierrez and I just completed my first year at ITP my piece is entitled misunderstood it's an interactive installation where you can place on this hoodie and when you flip up the hood you hear this audio narrative of a young black encounter with the police officer so it's a twopart narrative the first part is me telling my actual story so when I was 13 years old I was stopped by a white police officer so I'm recounting that in the first aspect of the narrative the second aspect is more speculative aspect of like what could have happened so I'm tired with the piece misunderstood because I think it's oftentimes at that point of misunderstanding where these incidents of police brutality become deadly so if you would like to you can actually try it on and experience it okay I definitely would like to you can stand in America and when I qu you can flip the hood up and that would activate one second what's he hearing on earth so right now what he's hearing is me talking about this particular experience so again when I was 13 I got stopped by a police officer so I was riding down the street on my bike coming from the store and this police officer pulled up to me and essentially told me several times to get off my bike after refusing the first time because I didn't do anything she became more and more aggressive in her approach so essentially after that she I got off my bike and she pushed me about the second aspect is told from a mother's perspective and again this is a more speculative story so you hear from that particular person's point of view of what happened or what transpired post what happened to me so I guess I can you know I don't know ya know I hear the whole thing okay so so yes so the reason I incorporated the mirror is because I wanted users to really be alone with their own thoughts and see where they're at just in relation to this project whether they do identify with someone who's black or brown or if they don't and if they do you know they had that internal conversation with their particular experience and if they don't they have it with them without those experiences he's always halfway through experience what's in the hoodie you can walk you can walk around and out and come back oh there's the ceiling look at this amazing gimbal that needs mirror and not yet nothing shows that this how's it going over here Oh Caleb alike so wow that's very intense yeah I first thing I want to say is that I think you're an excellent storyteller like your voice the quality of the recording and the way that you use sound I'm doing probably what the opposite of what I should do in a live stream which is experiencing so they go through headphones so I'm sorry that those of you watching couldn't experience that yourself I think that was really impactful the way that you told the story and especially used sound and so what did you make the decision to have the sort of speculative narrative turn into a different person's voice the voice of your mother I'm assuming yes yes so one of my friends actually did that voice over and I just thought I wanted to be true to my narrative and and make that distinction clear so you can also like feel that the second aspect of the narrative is a little more poetic in some sense but I really wanted to just capture you know close reality that could have happened you know so in my case I was fortunate enough to walk away but in many other cases these young black and brown men aren't but yeah I just want to give a different perspective just to bring in different audience and a different feel for the piece as well well it's really great that you're using interactive media to explore these issues and problems that are in our society today as well as created experience for other people who I didn't grow up with a similar experience to have some empathy and to sort of like you know obviously it's different being standing here at ITP with headphones on yeah but to be able to have some level of being in touch with that experience that you had it's really great I also just wanted I thought that I didn't realize there was gonna be like tactile feedback and that really surprised me and I think that's there was very loud gunshots and I would feel vibrating in the in parts of the hoodie which really you know I I do I like I probably shouldn't be listening to this anymore because I'm doing this like live stream but it was I just didn't want to didn't want to take it off so there's really in fact that's great thank you great work Derek okay great okay so let's keep moving are your sculptures moving oh hi do you know nothing okay just see the sound let's come over and look at these this oppa this is another sound project no I got to go away from something the sound project all right tell us your name and tell us about your project and when you see here they are five podiums and they are invisible sculpture on top of each of the podium so when you say invisible can you unpack what that means exactly we only see a really small amount of electromagnetic spectrum and I wanted to explore with the individual materials and so I chose to use sounds smell and temperature so people can think their different senses to interact with the sculpture and perceive some boundaries and form of the sculpture so unlike traditional sculpture that I would look at with my eyes this is sculpture that I could experience through sound through feeling through touch through just sort of smelling depending on as I move around I'm getting the smell of the sculpture association that's well I think it's gonna be pretty hard to demonstrate over the live but maybe we could try you want to pick one that we could try that might work for us to fear here and people when they touch the surface of the sphere they hear the sound like and they can finally perceive the form although there is nothing feasible like three layers of discs on top of each other and it's also the same idea but people can feel I can simulate and the third one is made of heat and I positioned infrared heating elements inside so it seems like there's nothing here but there is actually his sculpture which might look like this and people can feel their head I'm getting warm and when you see the heat camera that shows a thermal thermal image of this sphere and when I'm touching this invisible his sculpture my hand becomes brighter which means that I'm touching this warmth of this sculpture and this is may the cool air and people can so this is like a hollow cylinder shape that I designed and you can feel the cool air on top of the screen and they can try to feel the shape and the fifth one is made of smell there is some stinky stuff inside and imagine the air is from I can like smell it I have a bad cold so I'm not able to totally smell it but I definitely can't smell it top of here made of smell after the experience they make they make invisible sculpture visible by making these sculptures and people can have this like little amount of clay and they shape whatever they saw so this is uh I got some from yesterday and I only left some that I and these are collective perception of the invisible sculpture that people may see the sculpture one sound and on are some sheets cool air and smell and you can see all people saw sort of similar about different things great Thank You yourself okay let's come back over this way ready oh that's our actually so let's look over here loud yeah so you have to speak up because the phone microphone is very poor at getting the audio so can you tell me your name and a little bit about your project and then afterwards we'll shoot some video of the project my name is sebastian rallies and my project is in biases that live it's a website it's very website by physical ecosystem it's an ecosystem that combines singlecelled organisms with internet bots and together they combine they start creating a symbiotic relationship where they both start defending or benefit benefiting from each other here you can see some of the physical components it has a bioreactor that has living cells inside of it and there is also microscope live streaming the sample of the cells in the system and these are connected to internet bots as the bots arrived to the honeypot server they start really seeing food in the tanks of the cells and the cells also control the gates of a honeypot making it more attractive or less attractive to sales is there a URL that people can go to right now to see it running yeah yeah your ass is symbiosis dot live and once you get there you can control the microscope yourself and play around explore the two worlds colliding and interact me wonderful thank you let's try to get some nice footage of the different a speices somebody somebody put in there okay let's keep moving all right come this way okay hello can we check this out now okay so why don't you you guys want to stand together and so what we're gonna do is first we're just gonna have you tell us about the project and then we'll shoot some video of the of the project itself afterwards so if you if you want to there's four of you I'm gonna try to use this microphone first tell me all of your names and I'm Asha and this is our project search divides us so search of Isis is a project made for playful communications of serious research so what we tried to do was take a serious research topic which was bias and search engine optimization and then communicate that playfully and so for this class we were tasked to collaborate with an NYU professor and use their research so we were working with dr. Charlton McIlwain and he's concerned with how the way that the Internet's architecture currently works today limit and constrains what we actually see and this can create eventually segregation a problematic way so we've created a kind of a fun game to express that let's strip yeah let's play it okay should I try to play it oh my goodness all right what do i do first Oh should I oak boy the idea behind this setup was we're taking something that's normally a very private experience of black box and making it this large public experience you don't want to put your real information that's fine I'm going so far with my real information I'm actually moving right now so this is very useful no this is what the search engine thinks you should live based on your profile has found one recommendation for you well this is exciting I really like I'm kind of a I like to gamble so this is good and what would the search engine recommend you instead so now I'm back at the beginning that's great Wow I love this it's so much like a the way that you physically constructed this it really feels like a genuine game show mechanic in this like wonderful sort of playful way but it's such a serious in topic as well so yeah so I think you've really definitely succeeded at the playful communication aspect great work I mean love all the pieces of the design and the way that physical construction works amazing great job all right let's see here all right can we check out this project here we'll come down the line all right tell us your name and tell us about your project hi my name is Chauncey Chan and my project is called face blurred and judging by the name and the logo you probably can tell is about face book so if you stand on this sweet pole and look at my camera yes it will see your face has been blurred and a screen shot has been stable there and they will be downloaded on my laptop and then later I will sorry put them on a Facebook page called face blurred and all these photos are from yesterday yes aspect to this page so yeah this is my pixelbypixel homework and it's a image processing project and the reason why I'm doing it is because I feel like we are using Facebook for connect with people to share our stories and emotions just like data in their database for their business so I feel we have the personalized about Facebook so I've made this thing to tell my point and you can tell from this picture you can what can you tell you can't just can tell it's a maybe oh man and living in New York City you don't know what happened about him you don't know his story you don't know his emotions and that's just like a wonderful great job I really love the way that you put the logitech webcam inside of this guy at first I was like wow did you hack one of these outdoor surveillance cameras and runs no you just actually put the webcam inside it which is a really nice touch wonderful job great job okay okay can you tell us your name and a few sentences about your project first year student timeline of the far future so it's an interactive website that visualizes the future events so all the data here is pulled from Wikipedia using API and if users scroll they can see the how many years from now and they click the label below they can see the detailed events that happens like sixty thousand years from now and this is pretty horizontally long website so if user Scrolls more the background changes to the dark darker color and there's a lot of information here and there's an visuals like interaction which is relevant to the events for example this event is about the black hole so I made the black hole visuals and pretty same here and there's a simple interaction here and this is about Hawking radiation process so I made visuals like that and if they go more they'll see that is like this very far news from now and this is the last events for us it's free long is this online is this a website that people can go to online right yeah so this is the the URL so if you type www.blender.org and see these great wonderful great job thank you okay let's go to this front room up here we don't by the way this is let's just stop and look at this gym is not here oh she was here okay alright alright tell us your name and tell us about you a few sentences about your project okay so my name is Jim Schmitz and this is my Google Streetview style of transfer project the idea is to take pictures from Google Street View and then apply a style transfer algorithm to all the frames to make an animation so it looks like you're flying through animated painting as opposed to the boring street view Google Street View pictures well not boring but there if it's a cloudy day and bad lighting then the pictures don't look so nice so I wanted to make them look a lot more interesting by and artistic in this case the highway in Idaho is being transformed a combination of the seated nude by Picasso and this other photograph by cat Conor photographer amazing so do you this is we're just seeing like the rendered results here yeah but inconceivably this could eventually at some point happen in real time with what if you've trained the model in advance yes what I'm doing is different from what Coach is doing where he has a pre trained model over here it's doing an optimization for every single frame and it takes about five or ten minutes to do it your single frame so this video is actually maybe 20 seconds longer today than it was yesterday because it was running up until 1000 a.m. one of the things that I won't point out to you that's really interesting is it uses a optical flow model to make sure that the way that things are stylized in one frame is consistent with how its stylized in the next frame so you'll notice that some of these trees and that are zipping by and the sign for example in the car it stays the same color from one frame to the next and that's important to avoid any kind of you want to avoid any kind of flickering and I think it makes the the result wonderful job great job thank you okay let's come around into here and let's see what we can look at in here oh we've got to come look at the robots over here you ready for us or no need a few minutes okay let's come look over here first all right can you tell us your are you are you available to show us your project okay tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project sure rapidfire my name is Nate this is my thesis project it's called open kinetics it's an attempt to make a low cost kit for teaching electronics and code yeah and so it's like moving bass so it's like your do you make a motion controller and used to play games and and I think I could you know it was to sell this pricing for like under 30 bucks which would be really affordable so fantastic now do you I know in your thesis presentation you showed some demos of different projects people can make like this pong here can yeah can you play one of them for us or okay or can I play it yeah you can use this controller to move this panel on the on the left hand side just move up and down so it's gesture based so point it yes you hold like this okay I'm terrible at this are you playing player too I'm gonna lose on purpose there we go all right great job so so just to be clear the idea for this is that this is like a kit not I mean that someone would I put it together and then it would there it would come with some of these premade games you put it together and maybe a little online like in the browser so so you build the kit and you play games and you'd make your own games and that's right yeah fantastic great work okay all right can we see your lights all right tell us your name and a bit about your project hi my name is you know and this is my thesis project called Adamic Eve light I created a two series of augmented literary so this is creating argument to the light that can control the real light so let me show you some demo so after a few seconds is scan the object and walls and then I'm gonna blow into once again all right so my application generates argument to the lighting that can connect us and our light birth more seamlessly and more meaningfully and let me show you some second maybe this will be easier to capture with the iPad this is like multiplayer experience so I need a participant yeah so can you open this application and then okay yeah okay can you use vertically yeah so we need to scan the surface first until the ring is really strange so it means the application recognize the surface so once we touch the surface once anywhere so it's connecting you and me and this object so now we can play with this light by touching anywhere on the screen so you can see my creation and I can see your creation so this is basically started from how can recent lighting technology mimic the ancient Allah heat technology so I was inspired by campfire which emotionally connect us and have a sense of community so we designed this missile lighting technology to feel more emotional and thank you it's beautiful it's really magical I don't know how much this is can easily be transmitted via my phone's camera that experience of it and so just to be clear as you're adding light via the AR display you're also affecting the actual lighting fixture itself exactly that's why I'm going to make some combination between the physical lighting and augmented lighting and our mobile device great job thank you you thank you okay can we talk to you about your project now okay so tell us your name and a little bout your project and then after you say a few sentences we'll get some video of the actual you can tell this is my project perfect housewife it's a true kid desire for myself I imagine if I become housewives what I got a face I gonna pick out my baby and do a lot of housework so I trying to like make two key to help me to solve most of the problem and in the end I have a live performance it's like I I display a low like a housewife and make every every machines help me to do the housework and I play that I'm perfect but actually they the Machine keep broker and I have to fix them you know so it's hard to be perfect growing your life I trying to like through my project to discuss of other people's respect of the household labor because I feel like people ignore their household labor when comparing to other types of labor so I hope you can get some idea of how we yeah wonderful let's try to look let's try to look at some of these you can help me to like call my naughty baby to sleep and also allow me to play on my phone single video you will cook on me like that yeah yeah I used to like live all principle to indicate that the balance of the life and the work since like me this last one is my favorite by the way good machine so this one is like it will type good to encourage me to doing the housework like why my Hospital at work I think I need someone to like encourage me I'm finishing the work and there's a satire aspect of this is that correct yeah I love this one so much I need one that just types this dot this period this period because that's what I always forget when in programming wonderful these are really delightful and kind of crazy in the most beautiful wonderful black thank you thank you okay great all right let's let's go around I don't know where what else can we see here well okay let's this programmable air over here okay oh yes this is neat we can talk to Nietzsche okay oh we should look at this Oh top can we talk to Ken so just give us a your name and a quick summary your project make sure this is still recording all right okay yeah look into the camera say your name and a couple cents about your price okay I what's up Tara and this is my project I'm with Chuck Taylor and this is my project philosophy Megan you could just tell us about it then we'll get you operating it okay so basically what's happening here is you can I'm trying to simulate conversations between a user and that philosopher technically what's it what it's doing is its trying to look for responses in a certain corpus of effects based on the context of the question that is being asked and my reason for doing this is so that philosophy as a subject can be more approachable like it can be intimidating for an individual to start reading lengthy books of philosophy sound this I made this interface so that perhaps it can be more approachable or just final and so I can actually speak into the microphone yeah and it's gonna speak back to me but we're also gonna see the results here yes yes okay but like right let's try it let's let's let's try with the microphone okay all right no should i type it what do you think let's try it with a microphone good morning I'm gonna I'm gonna read the reply how I thank my morning dream that I thus at today's dawn Wade the world yesterday towards evening there spoke to me my stillest our I'll let everybody read the rest huh that's beautiful but what does it mean Oh Wheatsville oh I see what you mean so actually what you can hear is that but I'm gonna put this Microsoft ooh the microphone so this will get recorded wonderful I I kind of I need to come back and have a much longer conversation with Nietzsche cuz I got a lot of questions great job all right Ellen can you tell us about your project okay so just say your name and a couple sentences about your project and then we'll get some footage of people interacting with antastic so my name is Ellen Nichols and I created an interactive cubist mirror I'm calling it the painting mirror because if you stand close enough to it you'll see fragmented reflections of yourself and you can move those pieces around and create your own portrait fantastic okay let's get some live footage of people interacting with it jump in front look at this those studied with the camera does it like so this is just its left over in the position from where people were before it's live video moving into the shapes if you find something that you like you can double tap the screen and preserve it on Instagram and pick it up later so that saves it fantastic great job okay hi can you tell us about your projects yes so say your names gives a couple senses about the project we have to put each other okay I'm not even on this and I'm cher Chaudhary and we're gonna divide this time so this is living canvas and this is like data visualization with living organisms and we want to focus our attention on microbes and microbiome and we believe there's no love without your microbiome and we wanted to see that love United be because we are such a huge community so what we need is like we trace people's paths on the board and we cross that information with some samples that we took from different parts of the bill for the floor with bacteria we can study information to see how it looked like so this is 10 I to be students in just one day and what we're doing is like with reading consonants so places where we know bacteria live we put some also to protect the plants we're using plans instead of microbes because we don't want people to feel like a little bit though appeal by it and we wanted to have like a new to start a conversation about microbes and eventually what we want is to have a complete automatic system where we could trace people whereabouts and printed in real life and the reason we're doing this is because eventually we're moving to Berkeley and we want to have like a live in memory of how it looks like to be on the floor and like this huge monster that all our microbes are and reducing like robotics further which is so no this is what the is where we're having the interaction in today's project which is that whenever people are walking over the paths if there are people who will belong to ITP then they can they can trace their paths on the software over here and if you don't belong to ITP you can walk around come back and then have your parts drawn as to where you walked and where you moved around and after you've done all of that then from making the robot print the seats for you also the best part is that the robot moves on an XY also that but then you work with the robot and when it's moving on your part you are planting your own seeds and I know that it ends up looking like goop right now but what's happening is that these are multiple paths that are overlapping so when they do start growing which will take like a few days we're going to have living memories of the secondlast maybe spring show I love the way that you used this robotic arm basically to like drop these seeds amazing great job okay oh hello okay let's look at this one as we go programmable air yes let's all yeah you got to explain what this is hi hi I'm a table and this is programmable air it's an opensource pneumatics control kit for makers to play around with pneumatics an inflatable soft robotics fire can you demonstrate it for us all right let's see over here so let's meet Kim Kim wanted to make this sculpture which is which is an art piece which as you approach it it blows a bubble and then it sucks it back in when you move away from it and right now what it's doing is if you look closely the balloon is sort of breathing and that's because there's a small hole in the balloon and it's trying to maintain a constant pressure inside the balloon but I can blow it up and let it shrink back as well there's another example over here we have a nice vacuum gripper which is nice and soft but then I pull a vacuum and it becomes very tough so I can use it to pick up so I can use it to pick up irregularly shaped objects I think it's overheated yeah so this is a completely open source project all the details are on the github and have been for the past few months working on us some examples so if you want to see that's the vacuum dripper just working like picking up irregularly shaped objects or the same vacuum thing can be used for pick and placing electronics or for the Rube Goldberg machine here at ITP I blew up a balloon to drop a hammer on top of a sculpture because why not or you can use just the pressure sensor which is there for feedback to detect impacts for example if you take this tube and wrap it around a bumper car then when it hits something you can detect that impact with a pressure spike very easily and that's a irregularly shaped large impact sensor or you know you can get more artsy and make a airbrush because you have a high pressure air source so yeah all the details are on the github and I hope to make this kit available to makers over the next few months wonderful thank you so much ok let's go around this way we're gonna see some projects in here we're gonna maybe get in touch with the universe can we get in touch with the universe okay would you labor we'll look at this map first from Anita okay will you tell us your name and give us a couple sentences about your project my name is Anita Bob Ozzie and my project is about energy was actually for my energy class it's an artistic representation of the different energy sources around the world so from this screen you can see what the different colors represent so the yellow LEDs represent a solar the blue represent hydro red represents oil and then greenest biofuels white is wind energy so it's um it's just on an artistic piece and so from here you can see what different countries you is what different form of energy as yes as a source of energy fantastic I think we should can we take a look at behind it as well it all came together so much happens in the back just to show this beauty at the front wonderful okay Thank You Anita okay we're ready for the talking stone all right so first just tell us your name and a few centons about your project and then we'll demonstrate great my name is Roland Arnold and I am interested in true randomness because computational randomness is kind of fake I don't want this so I was interested how can I create true renders and how can I make true Rendon is somehow a spiritual experience to people so I created a stone that when you knock at it and you align with true randomness of the radioactive particles inside that stone when the patterns match it knocks back at you so basically the universe talks back to you because the true randomness is kind of a force in the universe okay I want to talk to the universe the universe the universe is talking to me I'm very very in tune with the universe [Laughter] wonderful I this I love the whole setup here I was saying earlier I just love the details of this little hammer and the nice little spot for it the stone rising out I love how you put this behind it it's amazing because there is a Geiger counter a Geiger counter inside which basically tracks about 20% of the decaying particles inside the stone and the rest is universal background radiation my solar flare whatever so yeah this is this is the talking great fantastic all right I wonder if we should take this moment to sneak downstairs what do you think how you doing are you feeling you can do more no it's okay Bobo will be so glad to be able to hear somebody you can go you think you've got the energy to do some more all right okay so we are now in the hallway stairwell of 721 Broadway I hope that this experience for those of you viewing it is somewhat worthwhile I know the audio is an ideal hopefully this is actually we probably just lost it in the stairway okay let's come around this way hello there how are you having a nice sit okay let's see what can we I don't even know what's down here to look at oh my goodness revenge of the left shark okay oh my goodness I'm so excessive all you have a green screen which is a beautiful thing second of all you're wearing a shark suit which is just absolutely fantastic could you tell us your name and a couple second and if you want to remain incognito as the shark that's allowed but and then tell us a bit about your project sure my real name is Caleb Ferguson and my stage name is left shark you may know me from 2015 when I may have messed things up during the Super Bowl a little bit with Katy Perry but I made this project you know thinking about it for three years after the internet was making fun of me for my dance moves I wanted to show them it's not so simple and so I made this game where you can dance with your own fins and see if you're good or not okay so I play it are you playing you play it you're just in you're just the shark I'm just here to program the stuff okay can I give you this microphone to hold if you want to say anything about what's going on you're welcome to sure you need to put on those blue gloves right there those are your fins so if I were a naturally occurring shark no because your fins would already people this was the music that I used to listen to reflecting on the past are you ready there's going to be a short tutorial and then you're in this game uses computer vision and pixel manipulation in order to achieve its goals including some code from Dan shipment himself here we go use your palms I approve fantastic not surprisingly fun I don't think I should be surprised here you go thank you this was a good workout oh yeah that's your folks all right great job thank you I feel like I've got so much to say about this baby I'm too just in the moment of being a shark and I appreciate the green screen I actually worked surprisingly well the computer vision and I loved the story that the this project has with it as well in terms of a dancey game so great job thank you okay hello there how are you nice to see you alright let's go let's uh let's take a look over here what is this Carly can you show us your projects okay so tell us your name and a few sentences about your project Carly so cool which is expressing myself in two fishes and I'm inviting the audience's go into the fish body and be a part of me and perform to make one fish kind of win so I can go up in there hello I am fish don't look at the other side I am better I need to be in control of my pool I own this body get out of here get out get out get a help language needs to be better language needs to be better get out get out get out I think it wants me to get out I actually designed the last part to be like nothing happening so people get kind of frustrated and a little angry and they kind of keep saying get out it definitely worked on me although I have to admit like part of it was me wondering oh it did stop working is it not detective so I think that's successful but it's always it's interesting about the context of an ITP show where you're always like is the thing broken is it working so that it kind of definitely infiltrates my mind when the audience is doing the speaking inside they're like very focused on just reading the scripts but they never see what is happening outside and they're becoming the performer being watched by others you can only see the collective body and it is like I have this sense being in there performing of that I'm really hidden and then I'm not like the stage fright or the sort of fear or like I just feel very free in there to do whatever I want in my face like and just and the fact that if the lines are prompting me it's a very like comfortable experience weirdly too because using my face exactly okay great let's go see if Artie has returned I don't think are there more projects down here so one two oh there's not that over there come back this way oh yes she's back hello can we talk to you about your project this is live streaming sorry too sorry to just jump in here but this is good because this is like a nice quiet spot it's so like so festive over here now this is from the photography department yes okay which is nicely linked okay so let's try doing this first tell us your name and a few sentences about your project and then we'll try to get some footage of the different cameras the pieces okay neo retro experimental cameras so basically emerges the digital and analog photo experience so you take photos with a digital camera but it immediately applies filters that mimic the quality of a film camera and it mimics the whole experience and there's no screen and all of that fantastic so can you show us some of the cameras or maybe and so we can see what they look like what I'm trying to do is create a business and so this would be like one part of the experience of these are different prototypes and how the cameras would be shelved in or like cased in this is all out of acrylic and so it shows like the colors and the styles that I would want to use and create in the camera one of them actually works it's functional but you know just mostly the prototypes and how it would look and what kind so the cameras mimic a film camera but they aren't actually a film camera so that what's the technology that's inside that's actually taking the image process again it's the Raspberry Pi 0 for the size make it easier to put in a case and then it's me just like exploring with different ways of using Python so it immediately apply filters that mimic it so I'd like studied film filters and then recreated them and then applied them onto the camera the photos that it takes so it's all digital but just like that experience and it's spontaneous you never know what kind of fields you're gonna get you don't know if you're gonna get a lot of light burn or Green and if people want to find out more or you do you have a website about it yet or what can you tell us what the URL is which is OJ oro calm and where does the name come from it's Spanish a ho is Spanish for gold and I translate it to English so it means really that these are essentially tools for you to explore your own artistry Oracle tonight wonderful they're beautiful I'm excited to have one someday great job congratulation sorry okay I wonder if we should we'll probably lose the WiFi but I almost feel like we should go outside and got a cup it's raining but it's waterproof that's an iPhone X yeah let's try it let's be bold what we're gonna attempt to go outside if they're livestream cuts out you'll know why it'll come back it's also raining so if everything if everything falls apart oh my god I shouldn't take this outside alright I'm gonna put this down I'm just gonna put this right here it's okay perfect yeah all right what else oh let's um there's a couple other projects back here yeah hi can we ask you about your project you tell us about it so just tell us were you having a moment yeah tell us your name and a few sentences about your project that will try to get some footage of it clothes for people this is a live stream going on right now it's being an only child under the onechild policy in China and then it got bigger and I started thinking about how power structures and policy affect individuals and identities and their individuality so I decided to create this kinetic sculpture as a response to that and basically it's an artificial erosion of stones wonderful we should go look at the same I'm just curious have you had people come through who have had similar experiences to you and and have they had any interesting reactions or feedback in that sense and it really made them realize like oh wow this affects every person every family and it's not just about population it really affects people on how they grow up and how how their personality or identity are being shaped and also it yes some people really said that wow it's so shocking to make them feel or start thinking about what are things that kind of like shaping them right now yeah I'm here watching your thesis presentation that sort of mirrors my son's a bit like oh there's a lot more to it than just a number I mean I add a sense of course that that's gonna have a social impact but I don't think I had thought through it as deeply or really and you know as in a way that your presentation got me thinking which is great all right so let's try to get some footage of the actual sculpture you get some sound okay let's should we go back upstairs we can probably wrap up soon there's a couple rooms we miss should we try this some more okay we'll keep going I should probably check on my my son is here would stayed home from school sick and I brought him to work with me a where's Ealy's project I need to see that oh I do yes okay we're going back up the stairs again I almost want to check it's just my own neuroses this is why I like live streaming and not separately recording anything as if it's not working people will tell you but this no one can hear okay okay so we're oh yes let's try it ahead there Haley wait one sec oh yeah who she bought it and it's a really playful research about the pushy bottom with different emotions today with the bottle has a different emotion and different tactile feedback and this is the excitement when you present and this is the impatient butter melody to the press so we might say to the patient hi did you say your name at the beginning yeah okay yeah this is I love this project so much can can I actually try playing with some of the buttons timid excited impatient and then you don't have these labels precise but then there is a different tactile feedback so you can try it this one is stubborn happy and this one is stubborn also we can see the underneath that's great let's just try that again just because that's useful explanation so it's really easy to press when I change the value here sorry okay oh my goodness yeah this is good I you know this is good this could be good for like physical therapy I feel wonderful great job okay I'm trying to avoid and fortunately the sound projects let's come over C and C D through okay it tell us your name and a little bit about your project hi my name is Metro and I'm here to show you Kenna Graham skinny grams is a slit based animation technique it's also a photobooth so people have taken pictures over here if you can probably so if you notice actually let me bring this down so this is Mathura one of our residents and you can see her I'm not sure how you see that actually looks nicer on camera interesting but yeah so this is what it is people have been coming in here I'm gonna give you the microphone you keep talking alright so we've got like a mini photo booth set up so Dan's gonna Dan's gonna take a one picture over four seconds so it basically takes four pictures over four seconds just do one motion slowly I'm going to say go ready and go perhaps but but this is what that looks like and I'm gonna so this is what that looks like I'm gonna print that out we can try it again I know you're faster in time but I'm just gonna print that out and you hand this to you you want to try it again we can try it again later yeah I'm going to print out right now let's one week why don't we come look at this or this and then it will come here and then we'll come right back okay tell us your name and a few sentences about your project can I try to play and tap on the screen who can have more score see one minute okay the winner okay sure oh I have to pick it up okay yeah I'm gonna put the microphone down just play there come over here and see this coin oh no it's gone okay okay I lost yeah excellent work that's really fine your head of course okay let's come can we come look at your guys project okay so tell me your names and a few sentences about what you make and Vidya is nearby there were four of us we're team evil or team primates so we were in a class where you pick an NYU researcher and then you make a public interactive exhibit about their research so ours is based on the NYU primatology labs research saying that primate brain size is linked to diet and not social factors so we came up with a few Interactive's maybe Dan wants to try this one here so which brain requires which brain requires the most energy to power so we built this with the alpha editor the p5 editor and JavaScript nice and then we came up with all this wall text just one question and well is almost done with this game so Dan you should also play this game we don't really need this out finding out which primate you are based on which diet you're best at so currently he's in the running for being a howler monkey yeah so I swipe your hands and see if you can get this the hardest level 30 not the rock let's see which monkey you are [Laughter] the level of detail you guys had to the interaction design and I like that there's full tutorial off there was really impressive I would say the second one was like confusing to me I didn't follow exactly what was gonna happen what I was supposed to do as much as it was still good but as much as the first in the third were like really clear so wonderful great work yeah okay oh yeah let's see if we have the photo will come to see use our own second okay so we're coming back to see the photo the same photo that you took a while ago I need to line it properly but you kind of see it red yeah so that's what you get fantastic okay yeah I'll come back again thank you okay let's do you want to tell us a bit about your project so tell us your name in just a few sentences about your friends you can give it your interest interior design decisions underneath learn to interest them critics wonderful can you operate it for us and so people who are familiar with the channel and some of the examples might recognize this is based on the color predictor that job reels created when he came to this in ITP and what did what's new about it what's different from obviously besides the visual design is that what what what elements are a bit different from that original example wonderful great job thank you okay oh all right Effie can you tell us about your oh this people also if you're a frequent viewer or a rare viewer of the coding train you might recognize one of the examples in here as well so um tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi my name is Effie let's call it because I utilized the classic Traveling Salesman problem and a genetic algorithm to solve this finding the shortest route issue and also this is like a practical adaptation of it because I'm actually using it in a realworld problem which is planning a travel route so here you can see I have selected many places and I can actually cancel and move where do you want to go you pick you pick flush so these are all the gardens and parks in New York City we can go to Jamaica Bay and then I go to confirm and you can see the computer kind of just do it instantly oh wow that was very fast how many points with that just now ten points a little bit of animation to take you through all the rounds it's really nice to see like an actual application of a kind of standard classic computer science algorithm problems so it's really great so I assume at some point once you have too many points that sort of it breaks down did you figure out what that sweet spot is during the show with many selections people make I feel like some people will make like 20 selections and then it's gonna take longer but eventually it'll still solve it yeah it's doing pretty good so yeah this is great thank you so much great job okay let's come on in here whoa oh my goodness we got a lot of stuff to look at here whoa all right oh my goodness this looks it that looks very intense I want to try that looks like let's see all right Barak and Tom you want to say your name and tell us about your project tell me your name and first just so we have it when it gets edited so I'm Barack and we got inspiration from the prisoner system panopticon and try to create this project that expressed our concern about mass surveillance so do you want to explore it before I explain it I'm sure here I'll give you the microphone and you're gonna you guys can explain it while I've explored please step back just move it let's see but they captured yes and it also mistakes you for Alden yes so Jim loved its bearded people and if the bees come stand with you probably you will see boats every day we have a lot of the beach some of the yes now wearing the same shirt so basically we put a cup of civilian camera outside alone the hallway and when you are checking out someone else project you're actually being captured so this is surveillance footage it live from the floor right now I think so say that again just we get that so I was saying that this is surveillance footage from cameras that we set up all over the floor and it captures faces and when you come in front of the installation it captures your face from the camera on top and indexes you against all of the photos that we found so you only realize you're being surveilled on once you come in face your surveilled image and so this camera at the top that's never showing the image from that camera here no that one is capturing your face and indexing them across all of the images from the floor wow that's really something that it's a great way of really unmasking this idea of surveillance in a way that's unexpected yeah yeah wonderful great job okay yes okay great ivy all right tell us their name and about your project hi my name is ivy and this is actually a group project but my two partners they have their own project here so this project is based on a research paper from neuroscience Department of Hawaii researches about the imbalance of the human brain and so human brain there's two neurons which one the one is excitation and another one is inhibition so when they're not when they're not balanced they're gonna have seizures or depression or 6/8 other sickness so people can clash it play and standing on the spots to find the balance of the brain so the white color is balanced so you can step on one thank you you see what's going on it's kind of like a game of Twister sorry yeah how to balance your ring wonderful this is also from playful communication of series exactly all of our project wonderful great job okay we got a try we got to try this I'm ready so tell us your name even though I know your names and pretend like we don't know each other no I'm just kidding tell us your name and a little bit about your project and we'll get some footage of okay great my name is Sam and this project is called harmony from chaos and basically I have some simple instructions here you just stand at the white line and move your hands around slowly and you control the forces in a particle field some are attracted to your hand and summer Springs connected to your hand and you can just using slow or emotions create some fun visuals cool can I hand you this microphone why and try it you can say anything you want I know I lucked out having some whiteboard area but yeah so basically as Dan moves his hands slowly around I've put origin points on his hands and so he's basically controlling where all of these purple and blue particles want to be and in the light blue and / white ones are connected via Springs to his hands so they move a little bit differently as you can tell yeah perfect dancin natural I can actually really feel like the connection between my hands and the particles it's great it's very intuitive I also like that there's kind of like a slowness to it as opposed to like just this flashy like it's gonna like explode Sparkle explode Sparkle as you move it kind of follows you on this like slow way so it encourages almost like a meditative like yeah almost like Tai Chi might be the shop but basically like it rewards moving slow and sometimes I've had people have been telling me that like they might even do more yoga and Tai Chi they had something to like visually reward them for doing that so yeah it's going to make fun things awesome great job Sam thank you okay let's come around oops all right let's get a shot of this beautiful signage here now y'all and Isabella so maybe I can I can I can I get you guys to tell us about the project and we'll just get some footage of somebody using it after okay so tell me your names and a few sentences about the project and I'm I own the project was made for a class called nothing creating illusions and it's a three minute video installation that uses projection mapping and basically we don't like to reveal too much of what the narrative sort of treats but is three minutes and it's the first person narrative alone astronauts and his last thoughts yeah the the installation itself is quite beautiful and striking it's a great job thank you thank you yeah projection mapping based everything you see is screens yeah all right let's take a closer look and did you write all of the text that's scrolling by yes yes and is there an overall story that has like a beginning middle end or is it kind of more it just loops or goes on forever time lapse let's say the person on the spaceship and nothing we confronted a lot of what an illusion means physically speaking but then also sort of obviously went into that in terms of assessing when an illusion means in the social cultural and political spectrum and so I think that's what our story is trying to get up is on deconstructing a few of the illusions that we have about the environment basically it's very cinematic with the sort of like low home and the immersive quality I feel like I'm looking at almost a movie set or something with really that that that aspect of illusion really really works well with the piece okay yes okay thank you oops yeah yes we care a lot of teachers we do get more alive we're gonna do this live Oh this must be some ancient phone technology with no camera amazed what is your name okay nice to meet you okay I think we're we're kind of close to we're kind of close to wrapping up I think I'm losing starting to lose steam I don't know about you dahveed let's come see when she oh we got some more over here all right all right we're gonna get a few more then we'll go back to this job we can do this okay can you tell us about your telephone some of your name and about your project hi i'm winching me this is my project maximum Bhaskar it's a to Kate about using creative technology to do street performance and also this is a performance that did two weeks ago at Washington Square Park so generally what I'm at is I'm using programming which is like a web technology and the cred like this socket among all the users like audience in a park and they can connect it to my backpack which in which I can use my MIDI controller to send away shows and sound to their phone to create is like very large soundscape so it's kind of like everybody in this space like start to jam together and that's in this project also I'm making like a jet pack so it's kind of like creating this like a very like a cyberpunk feeling so like a brings some new ideas to the public they'll be amazing wonderful I love street performance I love that you did this in Washington Square Park I can only imagine that strange and crazy reactions you got from people oh yeah there's a moment you can say like a to skate hair borders just I could pass me totally burn me that's like a typical New Yorker I love and also somebody even yelling at me it got you cancer that's like very interesting moments like as a stripper boomer you got a chance to explore the city in a different angle which is like a very very interesting way and I'm happy to pray all this emerging technology and the creative technology to the straight so introduce it to like a massive power that's exciting great work great job okay can you tell us a your name and a couple sentences about your project my name is Hussey and this is actually not my approach filling it with a for a friend his name is Rick one he'll be back but I can tell you all about it so this is Paul mimosa and this is a jewelry that is controlled by so the idea is as the wearer you can choose to show off your chest or not to show off your chest at all so if it's stand out it creates a destruction from the bus and then if you feel conscious you press a button and ideally because I broke it so it's about giving them and the choice to show off for another shows everybody wonderful we got some footage of the controller here can you operate it for us just to show us the controller oh just pret just just yeah just it's just for like later if we added something together I have some footage great thank you okay let's come over can we ask you about oh this is twister uhoh oh no all right tell us your name and a few sentences about your project we make this for a class called plan for communication for serious research we are working with a researcher specializing on the ecology and climate so the whole idea is humanmade climate change it will eventually change our lifestyle so we make this twister to do physical adoptions to our future okay try it yes sir okay sea level rise itself how do you compute a choose agrees although future like sorry those are based on the officers who game and so it's like generating the future before you know based on the lifestyle shoes great great job thank you okay I guess we could check out this room here novio can't do VR sorry project let's see oh this seems like I see there's like a Rothko like looking thing here hey so can you tell us your name and a few sentences about your project my name is Jason Young first year I could be student this is the digital Rothko so essentially what I'm trying to do is take painting into the digital age so I see this as a light painting which is using LED on paper to depict the form an image the same way a painter uses oil or acrylic to paints and I try to take all the this was inspired by Mark Rothko one of my favorite aspect painters and I you know I took his inspiration and I'm creating like an image which is the idea is if you can see the changes of the painting that are happening or very like slow because the Rothko's work the kind of an homage to Russell's work which is very meditative and the idea is kind of like like chaos founded by some degree of order and stability you know I wanted to make these paintings so that when you look at it you can look at it for a long time just like you can look into a fire for a long time or you can look at the ocean for a long time which is that it's always changing it's never the same yet you know it's always kind of the same it's kind of like the mix between the two which is I think what Rothko was getting out and is and its work and what I'm trying to do in my my work also wonderful it's beautiful now does it is it for at the moment is it just showing us one pattern of color or does it actually change over time or it's changing it's it's I mean you're not the Stan here for a little while to see it's changing but you if you can look at it if you look at it inside the two squares Lotus subtle changes it's generated by just random function or Arduino and so it's it's going forward it's never the same but this is I'm showing like four different patterns so I think this one's about to end and then you'll see the next pattern but you know the first ones take a very warm one the second one's the cool one and this one see I did this one to illustrate some of the visual laws of abstract expressionism which is like that if you put a blue down there oh there's a now it's gonna be a new one it really pushes back now this is this is a it's a different pattern this one is more about how red and blue interact on the eye especially when you're using because the difference between painting and this is like paintings using reflected light this is using project light and there are certain aspects or projected light it's are very trippy to like the visual system I don't know how to say evidence so it kind of looks like it's floating in air I don't know if you can perceive that great thank you so much John okay yes okay well here you are here you are oh boy but I think I might know what this project is yeah okay so first tell us your name and just a few sentences about the project hi I'm Mohammed I'm this project is called by the way hi mom and dad in Iran what I'm gonna show this to you later but this project is called reactive display which is the idea is like you always look leaning closer to look closer at things so why doesn't that thing help you out so for example when you look at look at this painting from up close and I can see all the better a better example would be like the map chart you know you're in the subway you want to look closer at the map to where you're going you always look close and it's very small but that can't be like okay that's a good union and I can look at Union or like my stuff there's useful I can look at that Wow can I try it or is it calibrated for you yeah there's a lot of people here that still I understand try together okay okay when I bring the other painting that's really cool all right this is you can see much more when you look in so let's go in Lexi you can see everything uh yeah Wow that is immensely satisfying yeah and it's pretty useful it can be used for any life it could be a business charge could be so I'm gonna really develop this put it behind a glass somewhere around to see how people react to it fantastic great job thank you this was my teacher I developed this in his class wonderful okay let's let's keep moving because I think we're going to let's I know let's see this sometimes the room let's go in here and maybe I always think this is the VR room but it's not alright let's come over can we talk to you about your project okay Kenny yes tell us you tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi I'm Kenny sejuani and this is the Handy it's a soft robotic to help people with neuromuscular disorders regain finger strength to rehabilitation exercises would you like to see how it how it works absolutely like I said this is a glove and so really what happens is that when a person's fingers are Sonique it sort of flops down and once it reaches this stage the muscles don't allow the person to open and close their fingers so this helps with open and close enough fingers and also to teach a person how to do functional things like pick up a sword or get dressed or something like that so usually like the first stage of this would be in the occupational therapists office when the person gets fitted they now put on the glove and so now the finger is in the glove and this helps them move it so it helps them bend and straighten and then pick objects different different things and so I can I see how this could be used in the physical therapy or occupational therapy context is it also something that one would wear in daily life to help with tasker it's more about training and improving the muscular function so I first before rehabilitation because the person has to learn how to use it and in addition while the person is learning how to use it I want to introduce machine learning and I want to introduce gesture control so while the person is training how to use it the glove is also learning more data about what the person needs to do so in like I guess version 2 or 3 the glove will now also know what the person needs and will have the person actuate their fingers in several different ways fantastic I'd love to talk to you about the machine learning aspect of this because it's a really wonderful project could be I'd be interesting to think about what could actually be add to it be useful and what might detract from it and not work some well so and now did you collaborate with occupational therapists while working on this or she was actually the one that guided me to focus on functionality I think of what somebody would need to use this for exercise is great and all but they also need to do things activities of daily living so that's why I some other functions of this right now would be to help a person pick something or like a core course you need to eat or swipe your face question here wonderful great job congratulations it's wonderful work okay let's see what else we can look at in here we got some exciting looking crystals over there do you want to tell us about your project real quick sandy okay tell us your name and a few sentences about crystallized textile Hannah croft who had been growing textile with embellished crystals she used salt crystals and so I decided to grow them using electrolysis and copper so how it works is that I have a positive and negative terminal and then I'm submerging it an electrolyte solution and then over time so if you look over there you can see the crystals forming their conductive so you can also see over there it's powering a working circuit so it has really interesting applications I think imagine doing this in large scale and having a lot of LEDs sort of lighting up crystal is powered by crystals is this just a slide presentation could you send it to me because if we're I'm I'm in theory attempting to edit together some footage from this and that might be useful for this project and so let's get some footage of the individual pieces too we could also just have you tab through them as you put the camera on it which might work just as well yeah why don't we do that too you could send them to me but just but just not that quickly just like you know ten seconds on each people are watching this live they'll be Auto what is going on in the chat it's very strange I'm sorry about the mic situation everybody in theory that I thought this was a good solution which is which is sorry that you're now just being here while I'm talking to the chat which is that I'm just recording the audio separately and I'm gonna dump it over later but it's too hard to try to like plug this microphone into the phone live so there will be a video of this afterwards yes sorry Thank You sandy okay all right Lauren you want to tell us about your project real quick I'm losing steam I'm starting about you at the ends of a rushing people through stuff okay okay already and so say your name and just a couple sentence about the project then we'll get some footage of you maybe operating this is an auditory social media platform built for low vision users so just think like auditory Twitter so my professor Gus he kind of complains rightfully so about how Instagram Facebook or really visual platforms and they're not really built for him so I saw that as an opportunity to build something from the ground up just for him it's also optimized for a screen reader as well I Tessa can you kind of show us some of the features as a sighted views user or as a low vision user I'll do it as a sighted user for now it's easier so I am going to record a bite and I want to let my friends and family know about my niece who just won a race yesterday at age six take my name in and then I record a bite Abbey won her first race yesterday because she's very athletic something that I will never have and so that posts to my feed right down here and I can also listen to my friends and family are doing that's amazing that's wonderful do you imagine that this is something that could be integrated with to make current social media feeds more accessible like if I were tweeting or Instagram any image I could also provide an audio description or is this really meant to be used as a completely separate platform I imagined it as a completely separate platform because I really wanted to have the experience of designing UX from the from the beginning from the getgo but I think that's a really good idea I never thought about it integrating it to other platforms I think that could really be helpful wonderful great job thank you thank you for joining us okay okay great thank you Oh all right Ren can you tell us your name
