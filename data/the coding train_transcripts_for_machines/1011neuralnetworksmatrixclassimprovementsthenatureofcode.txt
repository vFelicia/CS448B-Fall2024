hello welcome to what I hope will be the last video about matrix stuff in this series building a neural network so what I want to do is in this video it's just a little bit of cleanup I'm working on this toy matrix library in JavaScript that does the math operations of going to need for the neural network that I'm gonna start building in the next video but before I get to that next video I want to clean up a few things and make the library a little better again my goal with this is really educational and for my own amusement in many ways I'm not trying to create this highly optimized or efficient comprehensive matrix math library just a little simple toy library with some key functions that I'm going to need and as we get later as I get further and further along I will eventually replace this with something else that somebody has made which will be much better okay so what is it that I want to do I made a little list I'm checking it just once it's a list of my favorite things I'm just trying to reference random songs okay this is the list of things that I want to do and a lot of these came from comments from viewers so thank you for those one is I'm gonna add something called static methods to the library and why am I gonna do this well some of the functions that I have currently in the library affect the current matrix object that I call the function on matrix dot add some number to it that matrix itself changes when I add a number to all of the elements but some of the functions in the library actually create a new matrix object and return it don't affect the library the object that the functions being called on and this is where I want to introduce something called static methods which will make this more clear so I'll get into that as I introduce it I just notice there already is a randomize function in there but I want to improve that a little bit although I'll come back to that later I want to add something called a math function and what I want to do with the map function is I want to be able to take any arbitrary function and apply it to every element in the matrix so if I could write a function that doubles a number and then I could just apply to the matrix to double every number in the matrix that's going to be incredibly useful when I get to that neural network stage I have to say hey compute something like the sigmoid or the tan H the arktech there's gonna be all sorts of things that I want to do to every elements of the matrix so a generic function called map like nap this function to each number that's gonna be really useful and then I think that I thought of his eyes just I do so much console dot table the values if I just make a print function that does that for me that'll make my life easier and nicer and programming anyways hey it should be more than it's more than this but sometimes it's just about making your life a little bit nicer on a daily basis okay so I'm gonna start working on these things there's a live chat going for the people who will happen to be watching this live and not the archived edited version so maybe I'll get some other suggestions along the way okay so let's first ah first thing that I want to do I got this comment several times from viewers this is a particularly I did a kind of poor job choosing the name for this variable so this variable right here this dot matrix which is part of a matrix the matrix class every matrix object has a matrix variable it's kind of problematic because it has the same name as the name of the class and this can really confuse people so one thing I want to do is just change this to data so a matrix object has a certain number of rows and columns in the twodimensional array that stores all the values that's just the data of the matrix object so I want to change that and then there's some fancy those of you who watching probably know there's a like a fancy way to do this an atom let's see how do I do it like I always do this by accident and I can't do it on purpose where you click on something and it like changes everywhere else it is scratch that I'm gonna do it the oldfashioned way and I'm gonna do just to find replace I'm going to say this dot matrix replace that with this data because basically everywhere that I'm referring to it I'm referring to it by this time matrix so let's do that replace all feel confident about that and hopefully that's ok all right so I've done that now let let's move on what is the thing that I want to do I want ock static methods ok so let's look through this function randomized effects the data of this object fine this function add adds a number or adds another matrix to this particular matrix changing the values done transpose mmm I'm a little confused what to do here with transpose I'm gonna leave that I'll come back to it this is the one oh boy this is the one where I really really need to fix up because this is such this is such a disaster the way that I've written this function if if I get a matrix I create a new object and return that object if I get a single number I just multiply every value to this objects matrix so this is this is kind of a disaster I've kind of done two different wildly different things in the same function so what I want to do is add a static function so what do I mean exactly by a static method so methods are functions that are part of a class that are attached to objects made from that class from that template and so in the case here what I'm really doing is I'm saying things like let M be a new matrix and if I were to say something like m dot multiply multiply 2 this is not a static method in fact this is what I guess I think you would refer to as an instance method maybe it's a it's a regular function it's a function that's called on this particular instance of a matrix object but what if what I wanted to do is say what if I had two matrices and an N and I wanted to create our m1 and m2 and I wanted to say and three is and currently the way the library works right now is I would say m1 dot multiply m2 this is currently the way the library works right now and it would be fine to keep it this way but I think what would work better is for me to actually say matrix dot multiply m1 m2 and this is a and you've seen this before right any time in job JavaScript when you've done something like math dot random or math dot sign these functions are static functions part of the math object Oh God JavaScript it really tries to be crazy the naming of all these things but the point is it's a it's kind of a nice way of name spacing a collection of just utility functions and so there are some functions in the matrix library that operate on actual instances of matrix objects and other functions that are just kind of named spaced as part of the matrix world the matrix world and you could just put things in them and get things out of them and that's what I think I want to have this multiply function do so now I need to look up I actually have to look up that syntax for static methods in JavaScript because I don't know I've done this a bunch of times in the java programming language but it's probably different in JavaScript so let me come back over here and let me look up static method JavaScript and I'm gonna type in Mozilla because I like to generally get the Mozilla Foundation documentation and here we go static keyword ah so it looks like all I need to do it's very very simple it's just put the keyword static in front of the function so if I now in the real question is can I have a stat the same the same function with two names in other words am I allowed to have I basically want to have a static version of multiply that receives two matrices m1 and m2 and a nonstatic version that receives a single number that is that that actually affects the that matrix itself so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go and find I'm gonna go and take out this all of this math so this is all of the matrix product math that I worked out in the previous video and naming wise incidentally I called the two different matrix objects a and B so in a much simpler way I can just actually make the argument names a and B and remember I'm checking if a is columns or equal to bees rose okay so this should be fine I'm done and then here this multiply function is just the scalar product all right let's see if this works but before I see if it works let me actually add this print function this is not going to be I'm going to put through this on the bottom I'm gonna add a function called print I could just call it log maybe maybe a log is a better no no let's call it print and in the print function I'm going to say console dot table this dot data right so I want to just console table that this this dot data so let's take a look and let's let's let's try to manipulate some stuff in the console so let's say oops cannot read property matrix Jas line 45 of undefined so I messed something up so I had some other places in the code where I was not saying this dot data but some other matrix dot what neat now needs to be data so I can look for any where I'm actually saying dot matrix and your some other places and some other places that that's pretty good okay so I took care of that let's go back here alright oh I forgot that I have a sketch that's running that's trying some things out but let's um let's just say m1 equals a new matrix that is 2x2 and I'm gonna say m1 randomise m1 dot print okay that's the matrix m1 dot multiplied two so I want to double all those values and then m1 dot print again m1 dot print and we could see okay so that's working my old multiply function the multiply function that takes single number and affects every element of that matrix is working now let's see if the static one works so now I'm going to say let em M to be a new matrix and I'm gonna say m2 dot randomized and m2 dot print just to check it out whoops mmm why did that not work oh I didn't give it so I probably so I forgot to give it a number of rows and columns I should probably add some error handling into the library it's there's like hey you forgot to give me the columns and rows or use a subtree fault value let's let's try that again m2 equals a new matrix that's also 2x2 let's print it out and let's randomize it and let's print it out and there we go okay so now let and three equal matrix dot multiply m1 m2 this is now how I want to get a new matrix which is the result of the dot product a matrix product between matrix one and matrix two and if I say m3 dot print okay so I can only assume that the math works correctly somebody watching this a should feel free don't pause and check that method right in the comments if it's wrong but what I was really looking for I checked the math at the math work correctly last week so I'm really looking for now and I get do am I allowed to have two methods one that's static with a given name and one that's not static with a given name and it looks like I am and it makes sense that it would be able to do that because they're called in completely different ways there's no reason why the computer should ever get confused between the instance the computer the JavaScript interpreter should ever get confusing the instance version and the static version as an exercise to the viewer you know we can make some arguments whether what's what's the sort of optimal or most elegant way to write this library but for it as an exercise for the viewer what you could do is take this transpose function and make a static version of it which is essentially this right we about to to it make a static version of this and perhaps leave an instance version which changes the internal data of the matrix object itself to be the transpose matrix but I'm gonna leave that as an exercise for the viewer so the last thing that I need to do in this particular video is create a map function that's going to be a function that takes any generic function as an argument whoa so if yeah I visit I think I think this might be the first time I've really done this in a video in JavaScript let's think about this for a second I can write a function let's let's think about how I'm gonna write this can I use this eraser it looks like I can alright so I am going to create a function we got it we got to think about this for a second so if I were writing a function and I did this already called something like add and it receives a number right this is a function I have in my matrix object we're what I'm gonna do is say plus equal you know I'm gonna have a whole bunch of for loops for every element of the matrix add this number to it that's what this function does what I'm saying I want to do is create a function called map and what that function does is it receives a variable maybe I'll call it FN right now for function maybe callback is it's not really a callback so it's not a callback a FN for function and what it's going to do is it's going to execute this function somewhere in the code and this is something that you can't really easily do in a programming language like Java you can't make a function a variable that you pass around easily without some like real crazy gymnastics but this is very native to how JavaScript works arguments we think of M parameters to a function we think of emilie's Oh send these numbers in or send these yeah send these other objects in but a function is the thing that I can send in just as well so let's look at how this would work in other words instead of adding a number to every element of the matrix I want to apply a function to every element of the and let's look at how we do that okay so let's I think the ad function actually we can look here at this is kind of a useful I mean I'm gonna use this multiply function that instead of ad it just multiplies this number to every elevator as a starting point so I'm gonna call this function map as a kind of generic term for mapping a function and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say so I want this same exact apply a function to every element of matrix and I'm gonna say right now I'm just going to create a variable let value equal this data IJ in other words I want to say I want to look through every element of the matrix and I want to take that value now this would be me just assigning that element of the matrix its value what's its value assignment this is this would not change the matrix at all but in two steps I pull the value out and I put it back in but if I have this function what why don't I just apply that function to the value and put it in so I can execute that function with the value and then assign the result of that function to the data makes sense so this'll might make even more sense once we see how it's used and you know this is only gonna work if I send in functions that are written in a certain way but we'll look at that and maybe somebody watching can let me know what's it is there a conventional name for what you might call a generic function that's being passed in you know I don't wanna I don't want to call it function because that's a reserved keyword I could call it func map its funk funk that's good I like that funk let's change it to funk okay all right so now let's let's in order to see if I've done this correctly let me go to sketch KS which is sort of just a bit of like code that I can use to sort of mess around and see if things are working okay so let me keep and in fact this will actually negate the need for certain functions like randomized potentially or ad because I could always create those functions and did call them through the map but let's look at this so let's say I have a matrix and I'm gonna say a dot randomized and then I'm going to say a dot print so what I want to see is just and I'll keep this just as a two by two matrix it's easier to see so I'm gonna refresh this page we can say here's my random 2x2 matrix now what I want to do is I'm gonna write a function called double it and it takes some arbitrary value let's call it X and it returns x times two so this is a function a generic function that receives a value and returns the doubled version of it so if I say an a dot map double it what this should do is it should send this function double it in through the function map it's going to receive it here run through and now it's saying this data I J equals double it now so it's calling the double it function for every value in the matrix so let's go back to here and if I say a dot print now and I run this we should see look at this here's a matrix with values two seven seven three or two seven actually whoa and and now I have four fourteen fourteen six all the values are double great that works myself a little high I need a little reassurance it's no file in the form of bad lame sound effects okay so ah so I'm being told in the chat that and this is by the way it's often referred to as a lambda function maybe but sometimes it is useful to actually use the index values so there are there are so there might be a reason why you want to optionally also pass in the IJ the row column location of of each when you're calling the function that's being passed in because you might want to you might want to operate on it depending on where it is in the matrix so maybe if it's an edge you do something different so in that case this can be useful so this is a little bit of an additional advanced thing I'm gonna leave it out of my very simple library but I thought I should mention that and and it's up to you to then therefore so I could do something like as long as I is greater than zero return x times two otherwise return just X so I could start to do sort of advanced things like I don't want to just do this to everything but not to do something different to the first row all right so this brings me to the end of this particular video I am sure there are things I mean I'm really sure there are things this matrix class is missing that any comprehensive matrix class would need and I wouldn't be surprised even if we discover some things we have to change and alter to this as I start building the neural network but in the next video what I want to do is return back to this topic of a perceptron what happens when I have multiple perceptrons a multilayered perceptron and why all of a sudden does this concept of a matrix become so meaningful and important for the math of feedforward a neural network is actually often referred to as a universal function approximator right it receives input it generates an output why do I need matrices inside of that neural network to manipulate how I get the output from the input that's what I want to look at the next video the feedforward algorithm okay thank you
