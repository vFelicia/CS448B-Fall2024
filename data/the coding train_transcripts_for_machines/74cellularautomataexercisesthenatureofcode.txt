okay so these cellular automata videos have been a bit haphazard but now that we've looked kind of at an overview we looked at the Wolfram Elementary CA and have the lights on and we looked at the game of life I want to just kind of give you a quick list of exercises or things you might think about it in terms of taking these systems a little bit further as well as tying them back to some of the stuff we've looked at in previous videos so I'll kind of talk through these briefly it should be a short video and hopefully as time goes on I will be able to expand this or include links to below to some exercises or other implementations that are examples of this so a one thing that you might start with it first is simply you know the ca doesn't have to be a perfect grid of cells right what if it is a whole bunch of tiled triangles or arbitrary polygons or some sort of like crazy asure like tiling how would you have this cell state change based on its neighbors an example of that that I do actually have over here which you can find is exercise 7.9 is what if you have this cell's hexagonal and you can see each cell it's a hexagon has six neighbors what type of rule sets and what type of things could you do there so for those of you who are kind of interested in designing your own patterns if you've made a pattern could you make turn your pattern into a CA to create some sort of animation etc you also might think about it in 3d which I have which I've kind of alluded to previously what if you had a cube and what would its neighbors be and what could you do in terms of stacking or threedimensional design that way another thing that you might think about and this would be a sort of simple exercise to implement is probability what if you said in the game of life instead of a cell dying when it's over populated when it's over populated it has an 80% chance of dying what type of behavior would you get if you made the outcomes they tied to probabilities and what if those probabilities changed over time another thing you might think about is this idea of a continuous state so we've only looked really scratched the surface of states 0 or 1 alive or dead black or white if you look if you look at Wolfram's new kind of science there is a wide variety of implement with with with larger states you know four possible states 8 possible States but something you could think about is what if the state is a floatingpoint number between 0 and 1 point oh the reason that could be useful is you a lot of things we do in computer programming the data is it could be a map to numbers between 0 1 point oh that's nothing to think about I mentioned image processing in the previous video but this is really really key so if you're looking for an application of this that you know might relate to an interactive system are you doing something with depth data from the Kinect are you doing something with live images from a camera from a movie could you create some type of special effect motion graphics effect over an image through CA like rules and this is nothing new this is what a blur is this is what a sharpen filter are and I mentioned stuff about that in the previous video how could this cell how could as the color be the state of a cell and a new color that changes over time be tied to a neighboring set of colors so I'll try to include a link below to an effect that has to do with water ripple effect so if you think of the heights of the cellular automata being filled with the height of water and L if we have a lake which all the water is even and we drop a pebble into it and one part of that water height changes how does that height ripple out into neighboring cells so could we do a one rippling look effect with with Cas historical I think we also mentioned what if you were to design a CA where it's state is not just computed by the states that are in the previous generation but many generations over time or a state in the game of life it's been alive for a really long time what would happen to that cell or dead for a long time moving cells I think this is perhaps the one I should start the most I think one of the reasons for looking at this is you know the CAS are interesting unto themselves and we can do projects with them they tiny image processing but really if we're thinking about it we had that flocking system in that flocking system all of these Boyd's what if we thought of those boys as having a state and that state somehow defined its behavior the way it steered what it was looking for what was doing the way it looked what if those what if that CA all these are Sal essentially but they're moving and their neighborhood changes based on who happens to be next then at a given point of time so this is a way of taking our flocking simulation I hate to say this but to the next level right what if those voids in addition to following these rules actually have states that change based on their neighbors and the states drive their motion behaviors so this is something that would HIGHLY encourage you to look at if you're if you're kind of in your thinking about expanding the ways to simulate systems of moving elements and then you know that there's also this kind of idea of nesting complex systems right you know this is so this is that you know the world is a nested place right I don't know I I organ is a system of I am a system of organs this I made a room by myself but I teepee here is a system of people the world is a system of I teepees no but you get the idea right people the city is a system of people the world is the system of cities the universal system of world right this idea of nested complex systems like this terrible was a terrible explanation but I think you're getting the point right what if you made what if you had a flocking system where each boyd is actually a little mini Jima game of life or if you made a CA which is a grid of cells and each cell on that grid is its own grid of cells so how could you what would you accomplish with nesting complex systems in a way or CAS and flocking systems in a way that could be introduced interesting results with varying levels of zoom okay so this is I guess this video was just kind of a list of exercises and thoughts of things you might pursue I hope that this you can find ideas here for projects you might want to make and and I guess I'm hoping with these videos that I'm making calls I haven't really pushed on this is that videos like this could inspire or kind of out of the video like this could come become a little community of projects that people are making and links to them that relate back to some of these topics okay I hope I was recording I was I think this is the last video on CAS and the next video series will be on fractals
