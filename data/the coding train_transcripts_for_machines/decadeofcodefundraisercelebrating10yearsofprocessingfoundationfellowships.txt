e e n he hi everybody uh I just uh I was going to do a sound check but the timer says uh oh this song just started over there's a little bit of little technical difficulties here uh let me switch over to here hello oh oh look at that my desk is very high and you're seeing all the things hi everybody uh CH Cho Choo oh train whistle uh welcome to a very uh special hopefully what is special LIVE edition of the coding train I have a a guest today who I will bring on in a moment but let me just quickly give you a few important points about what is going to happen today so this is a celebration of a decade of code of 10 years of the processing Foundation fellowships if you look in the video description or the pinned message in the chat there is a donate link um I will I'll come back and talk more about that in a minute I just wanted to let people know immediately in the outset I'm looking at the chat people are saying hello to me that that is the proper and only way to donate to the processing Foundation decade of code fundraiser there are all sorts of other things enabled that are part of the YouTube platform like coding train memberships and super chats please do not use those to donate to the uh processing Foundation they won't go to the processing Foundation if you happen to do a super chat today for whatever reason I will redirect that money personally to the processing Foundation but if you what as we start to talk about the fundraiser and you see some of the benefits uh exciting swag things just going to drink from my mug here no particular reason um that you might get those you will need to get through going to the donor box link that is in the uh video description as well as a pinned message in the chat and apparently Dave is offering up a color palette I I'm a little suspicious of this message um rapael can you hear me yes okay now the audience can cannot hear you yet I I guess I I guess I spoiled it there but I'm going to now bring in our guest and I have to apologize in advance uh rapael dorville who is a community lead with the proing foundation who is here to join today's live stream we're going to have all sorts of fun coding some collaborative p5js together as well as talking my audio is very low yeah everybody always turn your volume up people my volume is fine it's you no I'm just kidding I know it's a little bit of an issue I will turn it up I'm always paranoid about clipping but actually Raphael helped me uh with some new OBS settings so my volume I just actually that that might have been the wrong button I have so many dials and things I'm really not very good at this whole technical thing and I have to really thank Raphael who spent a good hour with me this morning helping me configure open broadcast studio I added all these buttons to my stream deck we have multiple scenes with both of us with Rafael only so let me stop uh just vamping here and bring in our guest so that you can at least see and hear him and I'm hopefully G to press the correct button that's going to do this correctly aha yes so Rafael you are now live say something to make sure your audio is going through say hello to the coding train audience hello hello coding train chirp chirp and I can see already just the levels here that you are a little bit louder than me so I'm I'm just adjusting it so um uh hopefully uh you can continue to let us know in the chat about the audio levels uh you know you might be thinking you're watching some kind of professional operation here but it's just little old me in my garage by the way uh interesting little tidbit I'm in Upstate New York there is about two feet of snow outside maybe I could take a picture with my phone of the snow and show it on screen in a bit it's remarkable it's incredible and also uh let's all say do our little dance uh to the internet uh uh God's hope that I don't lose like a connection or any power internet issue but so far everything's going really well so um uh rapael is here maybe rapael could you want you want to just take a minute to um introduce yourself and then we can move on and talk about uh you if you want to talk about all the things that you that you do processing foundation and your Twitch stream and all of that and where you're based yeah spot sorry no no all good uh yeah apparently I appear as a a Godzilla format on the on the stream I don't know uh but but hi everybody uh so yeah I'm rafhael I'm uh I'm also streaming regularly but I'm here in my capacity as a process as Community lead at the processing foundation and uh here to celebrate 10 years of the fellowships we have Sig in the in the chat uh appears with TT who is the who is the the responsible for the fellowship uh and uh and who has been running the fellowship since last year uh who who can also ask tell you more about it but we'll we'll talk about uh we'll talk talk about what we know and uh yeah um I'm very excited to be here we I had uh Dan on on my own twitch stream uh sometime when was it two years ago and uh it's nice to be uh on board the coding train today wonderful uh thank you um so while uh um so I realizing we have all these wonderful people from the foundation in the chat and I wonder if I should make them give them little moderator badges so I don't know if you want to just first of all this is like so exciting because there's like so oh wait there's somebody else to talk on this like like stream so let me just quickly go here uh rapael if you want to just I was starting to do this and then I didn't get very far so if you want to talk for a minute more while I see if I can add some moderator badges here yeah for sure uh yeah so I mean I'm sure a lot of you already know uh about bring Foundation um it's been uh it's been out there for a while processing itself started in 2001 but processing Foundation started later and uh and the fellowships uh which have had uh yeah some uh incredible impact in various ways uh one of which in particular um all of you here are familiar with which is that p5js itself started as a Crossing Foundation Fellowship uh when Lauren started started this project um and yeah since then the fellowships have evolved into into something uh much bigger and uh much more structured as well thanks to tig's work um recently and so yeah we'll but we'll show a video shortly which uh has been um has been made specially for this fundraiser and that shows a little bit like a little preview of what uh what the uh what the fellows have been doing lately it's it's a fantastic video was made by uh Lune I believe um I forgot the last name sorry and but yeah all the credits are on the donation page if you click that link that you see pinned in the chat you will uh you will be able to learn more about the fellowship see the video but we'll play it here as well so and and I pulled it up on screen now so what you're seeing on screen is the donorbox page uh the decade of code fundraiser and um one of the the most important links probably on this page Beyond uh there well there's two links that I think I'd like to share with you um um the processing Foundation fellowship program medium post where you can read all about the most recent 2023 fellows as well as the processing foundation's 2023 uh impact report this is an extraordinary uh piece of work um maybe those of you from the foundation who in the chat could properly credit uh all of the uh PE people uh who who I know that Design Systems International everyone worked on the design of this report um and xiawei worked on a lot of the editing and writing of the report as well as obviously the the board of the foundation and a lot of the staff um I just don't want to miss anybody but if you want to learn more about what is happening with the processing Foundation um in the last couple years not to mention the last 10 to 20 years um this report is incredibly comprehensive I'm just sort of scrolling through it now um so I want to play that video but I thought I would talk just for a minute um about my experience with the processing foundation fellowships so um I was one of the folks who uh you know I I was telling the story the other day to some people who literally I I like to imagine that I was you know somewhere like banging on the door of some giant governmental office with like a giant stack of papers to try to turn the processing Foundation uh into an actual 501c3 uh organization here so I know we have a a global audience here so in the United States there is a category for of tax exempt status for any charity or nonprofit that's what the processing Foundation is um previous to the foundation there was just a you know dispersed uh a group of contributors a volunteer who would work on the processing software which was started by Casey Reese and Ben Fry at the M media lab in 2001 I came into working on processing the Java software in around 2003 when I discovered it as a graduate student at ITP and in 2012 I was lucky to be offered the opportunity to help start the foundation so what we're really celebrating here in this decade of code there's a lot of 10year marks but you could also kind of consider the foundation as having it I mean 2024 minus 2012 you know you do the math it's maybe a little bit different than 10 years but I think we could also uh kind of point to that as well but one of the reasons for starting the foundation was to be able to do more than just maintain this open source piece of software but really think more deeply about what it means to be in community with the people who are maintaining the software using the software and I know that's something that Lauren McCarthy really talks a lot about and um really did an incredible amount of work hard work uh when creating the P5 project of blurring those lines those lines really shouldn't exist there is no difference between developing in my mind between developing software and the community of people who are developing and using that software and so that I think is where the idea of the fellowship started as a way of providing uh funding and uh mentorship and a structure for projects that are speculative that are experimental that are education oriented that are Community oriented and even though we didn't have such an organized system for an open call and applications and a review process uh you know the that was more ad hoc at that time but that concept that idea is what allowed something like the p5js project to begin and now flourish so um that's just to give you a little bit of background there I don't hopefully there's a lot lot of processing Foundation folks in the audience I guess I I'm kind of still a part of the processing Foundation as an advisor as an enthusiastic uh evangelist to the foundation but I'm one of the things that I'm most excited for you know I uh um is for uh all of the new leadership of the processing Foundation the new project leads uh all of the staff and that is now organizing different programs and Community initiatives and all the finances and so much work in the governance of a nonprofit organization you would be surprised it's not something that that I particularly good at and uh there's a wonderful team of people who are excellent at these things right now uh uh running the the beautiful and wonderful processing Foundation organization so I'm I'm I'm just rambling here and so there was I was trying to make a segue into playing the video is there anything I forgot do you think rough or any questions you want to ask about like you know anything related to the that I might have somewhere in the recesses of my brain around the history of the the projects the foundation and the fellowship uh oh well just one one thing since it's on the screen uh this beautiful uh background which we cannot see too well right now but we'll I'll show all the the desktop backgrounds uh later but this visual that we're using all around the decade of code fundraiser promotion is uh made by Ronnie calman and it's called rainbow ribbons it's beautiful and yeah um I just wanted to give a shout out to roony for this this wonderful work and also to all the artists who made the wallpapers thank you yeah so today is really um meant to be just just like these wallpaper backgrounds and I think maybe um ra will show some more in a minute after I play the video is really just meant to be a celebration um uh we I we I highly encourage you if you're able to if you have the capacity to donate during this stream but just so you're aware we're not getting live notifications there's no uh there's no like old rotary phone that I can pull up and you call in so in the old ton style so but um if you donate uh if you're able to donate thank you so much um and I see I'm seeing all I've seeing names of people I've see roony in the chat who made uh who made this beautiful uh rainbow background so um I'm imagining that maybe some of you watching today might be interested in applying to the processing Foundation fellowship program yourself so what I'd like to do now is play you this short video that is all about the fundraiser the different benefits from the fundraiser uh about the decade of code as well as showcasing the work of the most recent Fellowship cohort I have to say that I was lucky enough to be able to attend the 20123 fellowship Salon um in New York city hosted by uh sigay and it was just an incredible experience to get to meet and see the work of these fellows so I'm so uh thrilled to be able to get to play this video for you now hopefully this is g to work I set everything up I have a button that I press when I press the button the scene is gonna switch it's gon to play that video You're G to hear the audio you won't hear me you won't hear WRA but if anything goes wrong uh you know I'm just letting you know that things tend to go wrong on the coding tree so uh um and yeah so let me just get let without further Ado let's play The Decade of code processing Foundation fundraiser video join the celebration of innovation with the processing foundation's Deca of code the real heart of this I think that's what keeps me going is that this isn't just a coding resource but it's a storytelling resource it's a resource that connects young people together E5 processing we have a very friendly Community everyone help each other and support each other think about Technologies differently in a nonmechanical way everybody is an expert in their own environment we're really looking to uplift the voices of those that have been silenced I'm speaking to archival interventions by black Scholars that really um like underscore the urgency of challenging dominant narratives as we hit a remarkable Milestone the 10th anniversary of our fellowship program we're thrilled to unveil our decade of code fundraiser but this isn't just a look back it's a bold Leap Forward into the fusion of Art and Technology your contributions are the Catalyst for our growth in software education and art fostering a community where creativity compassion and Technology Thrive and I think uh processing and p5js are such incredible tools if whether it's a gateway to learn how to code or building the tools that maybe we need to see in our community or in our movements and guess what your generosity comes with perks we are offering an array of exciting rewards including limited edition merchandise digital goodies and of course our Everlasting things so come and celebrate with us people say you're muted ah I'm muted I was saying all these beautiful things Rob wasn't I saying the most incredible articul beautiful meaningful things yes you were uh okay um yes okay thank you to moner who has told me I'm time this is by the way I do this all the time I like so carefully mute myself because I do not want to interrupt the Beautiful video and then I forget to unmute myself on the videos over anyway what I was saying is um thank you so much for being here for watching this video I I said it more eloquently but just the act of you tuning into this stream is in of itself a donation to the processing uh Foundation it's uh being present and being here in community if you're if you have the capacity to donate to financially support the work that's great but there are so many other ways to participate and give and one of which is just watching here and uh uh you got a little taste of the 2023 fellows in that video but uh if you go to the pinned uh Link in the chat if you go to the video link in the description it'll take you to the donor box page and you can read more um by uh uh visiting the medium post about the 2023 fellows there'll be links to their own websites social medias and you can follow and follow and learn more about them there um and then if you just happen to be completely new and you just maybe used P5 maybe you've coded before but had no idea about the processing Foundation if you scroll down to the bottom of this page first of all you go bypassing the this is something new that I learned by the way does does anyone in the audience you I give you a minute here know what this is called this is totally new to me if you're hungry it might you might like it might pop into your brain more closely uh so there's a new term I learned but if you scroll all the way down look at this beautiful pin uh made by the wonderful artist Anna Carreras um and then uh there's a link here I just say that you can subscribe to the processing Foundation newsletter as well as I'm looking for the impact report um is somewhere linked here yes the processing Foundation 2023 impact report okay I'm looking into the chat to see if ah yes so grey web little train whistle perhaps a honk from Raph uh um wins the uh prize of uh this is apparently called like a cable taco or something uh Tech Taco Taco yeah a tech Taco delicious okay I'm trying to think of oh so maybe what we can do next before we start to do our fun live coding session is if rth what if uh what do you think about me having you take over the screen and talking and showing about some of the wallpapers that were made for the decade of code yeah yeah let's do that um okay this is exciting hold on here we go I got to press the right button there we go we've got a a a much larger Raphael now on screen I think you can still hear me but no one can see me and I shared my screen so yeah I hope this works um so yeah the uh uh I'll I'll see it on the stream when uh when when catches up I can see that it's working cool awesome so yeah uh I wanted to mention a few things uh before we get into the uh yeah before we get into the wallpapers uh you mentioned the the pin so uh this is the first so we we we have managed to the the logistics of getting all this merch produced you wouldn't believe but uh we managed to get 100 pins so the first people the first hundred doners to donate $100 or more will get this exclusive pin that is has been made and designed by anakara specifically for the fundraiser it's uh we're really grateful uh to her she's a fantastic artist please go and check out her website and and the work that she produces she makes generative art uh absolutely beautiful beautiful stuff and she's a fantastic human being as well um and yeah she made this to represent the blossoming inspiration of generative arts and creative coders uh through the work of the foundation in these last 10 years um so yeah this is uh this is a special limited edition one uh and uh and then yeah the rest of the merge you'll have a sticker pack this is not fully representative of all the stickers that will be included but there will be at least those and some more uh tilt bag and this the tech tackle yum yum uh yeah there you go but yeah let's talk about the uh the wallpapers so we asked a number of artists from the community to contribute desktop backgrounds for for people who will donate uh you will get those at any tier of donation uh from the smallest to the largest uh every donation accounts and uh you will also get it if you can't afford to donate at all uh but you want to still get the the desktop background you can you just have to sign up to the newsletter there's a link there as well and if you sign up to the newsletter you will get the link not immediately but in the next newsletter that will come out sometime this month uh the link will be there and we'll make sure to include the link in the next two or three so so you don't miss it um but if you donate you get the link immediately just check that the confirmation email doesn't go to your spam folder because then you wouldn't be able to see it but yeah you should see it uh immediately you get redirected I believe we set it up that you get redirected to the to the impact report uh but so you will get an email confirmation of your donation uh if you're in the US I believe you might be able to also get that uh off your taxes uh but uh don't quote me on that I'm not sure how that works out there I'm in Germany by the way I forgot to mention that the beginning so uh yeah anyway let's go to the uh yeah let's go to the wallpaper so this is the list of all the artists who contributed Angelica nilia Brian woo I'm going to butcher the names but I'll still say them all Dave who's there in the chat I've seen Elio also known as garabatos Henry Tran Jew Park Jordan Chan Juan Carlos Pon campano Kate n Maria Panetta M white mamir Peter ha Rony calman Ruben medin Sophia wood tan Tong Torin BL Smith and Walter Marino so yeah let's check out uh some of those so oh wow this is beautiful um we have uh included also text files that will tell you a bit more about uh each each piece uh so yeah this uh this one in this one we have only one but normally you have different formats uh one for desktop and one for uh phones and so yeah some artists distributed more than one artwork so you'll you'll have plenty of choice so oh yeah this is fantastic so this is Brian woo yeah ah magnificent um and let's see what else do we have uh Jordan I I like this one because it's BBS and that's kind of my thing but it's also trains so it's both we have burb trains I I believe that was made for the the challenge where you joined uh you when you joined me on Twitch I run a week challenge on Twitch Shameless plug and uh and yeah we had the topic of train once and uh that was U that was Jordan's contribution and I asked I asked them if they would make a desktop background version of that so yeah you can have it on your phone you can have it on your on your desktop uh and yeah roony uh whose visual we also used as the the main visual for for the for the whole fundraiser campaign uh yes iconic sketch indeed Ronnie says in the chat the the BBS one uh but yeah this is uh this is the rainbow ribbons and yeah that's uh I have this one on my phone on my lock screen and I love it it's just so perfect for it uh it makes me happy now I used to have just black on my desktop on my well on my lock screen because I because I'm minimalist but now I have this and it genuinely improved my mood so see if you want your 2024 to be happier uh use those desktop backgrounds it is tested and approved by me uh Sophia who made some uh really wonderful ones as well that are inspired by space and yeah let's see it's loading it's loading yeah there you go absolutely beautiful and again you have a version for desktop and a version for the phone so yeah uh this this can all be yours for the the small price of just signing up to the newsletter or donating and then you get the link uh so yeah Link in the chat pinned in the chat to the donor box campaign uh and yeah if you donate you will get access to this uh this folder right now I see donations coming in already thank you to sadra Jenny no uh yeah thanks for your donations um yeah and thanks to all the artists who contributed with their art uh this is something I I definitely want to expand next year for the next fundraiser I think this time we we reached out directly to artists we knew um it was a little bit last minute and so thanks for everybody to to for bearing with us and sending sending making adapting your work for the format and sending it to us very quickly that was uh that was really helpful and I think I'd love more opportunity to showcase the work of the community this is something that uh there will uh there will be more of that in the near future little teaser on the P5 side of things but I don't want to I don't want to Rob Q from the chance to announce these things but we're definitely looking for ways to showcase the community's work and art creation creativity in general uh more even more than we have in the past and in an ongoing way uh but yeah I I'm thinking next year might be fun to have this be more of an open call instead of just reaching out to to specific people Al so we have an even bigger collection uh and if you think of other formats that you think might be fun for for uh virtual rewards uh we have the actual physical merch but now we have these these virtual rewards uh yeah just let us know what you'd like to see and uh we'll we'll figure out how to make it happen uh yeah that's uh that's the that's the collection all right thank you so much I'm so I I want to Pat myself on the back too much I'm so thrilled with these different scenes are working although as you might notice um Raphael is actually we're approximately the same human style size uh uh creature but I know it does appear that rapael is much larger than me it's just our camera views are a little bit different uh but uh but um so thank you so much for taking us through that um I was really it's really amazing and beautiful to see all the wallpapers I mean that to me has been my favorite part of participating in the processing uh Foundation community and as a teacher and somebody who makes video tutorials to me like seeing what people make based off of an example or a lesson or inspired by another artist that chain that tree that branching of creativity that just goes all over uh across all ages and countries and globally and Styles um that's really been just like the greatest thrill for me uh for someone who is teaches with the stuff and has been working with processing and p5js for many years so it's great to see that come to fruition here um in the form of these beautiful wallpapers and I guess you know maybe my children will uh uh will will won't be too offended if I change did I take their photos off of my phone lock screen for just a brief week and put some beautiful uh rainbow uh they're they're old they're like teenagers now they probably don't want to be on my uh phone lock screen anymore I don't know why I'm talking about this um all right so uh yes rapael you're raising your hand you can just talk you should just interrupt me I have a an Affliction which is to just continue to ramble awkwardly and try to fill any possible silence I'm used to doing this by myself no dead air no dead air ever yeah uh that's that thanks and uh one thing there two things I wanted to mention first I wanted to thank Sonia as well for for their incredible work uh coordinating all of this I contacted some of the artists but Sonia was really the one to put all of all of that together in the good format making sure that we have uh the metadata for all of the uh for each of the artist with a little bit of a bio for each of them and their links so if you're interested in knowing more about each artist in the collection there are links in those text files that are that are with it um and uh and yeah and the other thing uh you said uh you you don't want to replace your existing if I I don't know if you're using iOS or Android I don't know much about Android but on the iOS side the thing you can make you can use Focus modes and I do have different Focus mode for with the different backgrounds for for work so when I'm working with the foundation I have actually uh I have actually these uh I don't know if I'm still sharing you are still sharing I switched you off for a second but you're back now nice um so yeah uh this these are backgrounds that are inspired by Design from DSi who made uh so Design Systems International who made the design for uh the latest processing website for the impact report the beautiful like all the beautiful design in the impact report that you showed before this is thanks to DSi so thanks to them and uh I took some of the thanks to their uh to run for letting me uh access those uh those visuals and I made some some adaptation of those for for desktop backgrounds as well so this is a little bonus extra that comes with the the wallpaper collection uh so if you want a a process wallpaper or P5 wallpaper on your desktop on your phone you can you can have that there's even the the python processing one and uh uh processing for Android so yeah there there you go uh I have those as like my work focus and I have ronies as my streaming focus and yeah so yeah you can you can have as many as you want there wonderful all right I'm gonna switch you back now Rafael if you want to yeah perfect so so let's switch back to I got to find the right button here here um so a couple things just to note thank you saber you're not following my instructions Sumer gifted some coding train memberships which is very kind of you uh but this is a processing Foundation fundraiser it's not a coding train uh uh uh is a coding but we're on the coding train but um so just so everybody knows uh if you if you just happen to jump in now um you want to find out more about the fundraiser everything that's on this page here um there is a pinned Link in the chat as well as a link in the video description um and um thank you to all of you who are watching and who are donating so we're gonna move to the bian milisha and Dan yeah so ra I guess Rafael has access to a live dashboard of donations so you should feel free I wish I wish we had gotten myself together to have some like you know Hearts like explode onto the screen when somebody donates but next year we'll do that next year uh but but but rapael can shout people out in their thanks um so uh uh since I one thing that I love to do on the coding train and it was reminded uh it's okay sabber I'm just I'm just teasing you um but uh uh one thing that was um REM that I was um uh reminded of when talking about the fellowship program and the community and all these beautiful wallpapers is how International um and and you know I I say this as a an obnoxious American basically like you're what is international really I mean we're all just part of this uh cohort of humans but anyway Global that's the word I should use this uh Global uh community and so one of the things I love to do on the coding train is here where everybody is from so Rafael and are going to start getting set up to do some live coding I'll also just briefly share since I have control of the screen here um I am currently an upstate New York and I while Raphael was sharing the wallpapers um I just grabbed a few photos off my phone this is what it looks like outside right now I took a picture of me in the same gles you know this is real took that just now not a fake fake snow that's the snow and this is uh I know coding train audiences might be familiar with my dog Gloria pickle this is what we had to do this morning to shovel a little area for her to go go outside and eat her food she has to eat outside um because the cats eat inside in the kitchen and if they're not separated Gloria will go and eat all the cat food so um that's why you be like why are you making your dog eat outside she likes it it's good trust me it works out for a family okay never mind okay so back so um so hopefully we're seeing in the chat um where folks are from we've got Minnesota if you've got any snow you can let us know how much snow you have I think there's I think there's got to be at least two feet out there right now it's it's remarkable a Gloria when I took her for a little walk she's like a short she's kind of like uh she's like a built like a tank but kind kind of short her whole body just descended into the snow was really amazing okay um it's snowing in Brooklyn but not nearly that much uh okay the coding SLE um all right so shall we move on to rapael is there anything else you wanted to say about the fundraiser or do we um anything else before we kind of move on and start see if we can get our coding setup going yeah no I think we're good I hope we mentioned everything if we didn't uh Kate sabber Sig feel free to feel free to let us know and um uh I see there's a message from Bianca in the chat that says donated but their address is wrong so yeah I would um I would just email the foundation I think it's probably there's probably like a hello at or info at somebody in the chat we'll let you know but you can send to uh uh uh yes Kate is already answering Foundation processing foundation.org okay um all right so Rafael are go and I are going to attempt to do something we haven't done at least I haven't done before and uh what you're seeing here now on screen is Visual Studio code if you followed any of my tutorials you're probably used to seeing either the processing IDE which is the Java platform or uh p5js in the form of the web editor which looks like this um it's what I like to use when I'm teaching and coding and sharing sketches but Visual Studio code which is a a text editor essentially for anything you could obviously you could use it for a lot of things Beyond just p5js but it has a certain feature in it two features that that I think are going to make this session kind of exciting one which is just live preview which is over here it's uh an extension I can show you how to install this so if you have Visual Studio code and there's a button here all the way over on the left if I click here under extensions and I were search for one like a live preview um you can see what this what this extension does I already have it installed is it runs it it it uh it hosts a little Local web server in your workspace what does that mean my workspace is a folder of these three files and it's running a web server which then opens up a little mini preview browser window it's right above Raphael over there which shows the P5 sketch so this is that's just that's the less interesting piece that's the piece that's just like oh how would I create a P5 sketch and see the results of it in Visual Studio code the exciting piece the thing that's totally new to me as of today Raphael helped me set it up this morning is called live share uh and what live share does you can see here if uh Rafael you can just start typing whatever ra Raphael is invited to this workspace now in theory it is technically possible for me to invite all of you who are watching I'm not gonna do that right now don't get your don't get too excited I don't think I have the stomach for that I don't today but we'll see maybe at the end we we'll let that go you know I have a I have a like I could just like yank the plug the cord out from the wall if something goes horribly around but um I've sent rapael a private link I mean maybe there's some way some of you uh enterprising and resourceful viewers could figure out you know to hack your way into it I'm not suggesting you do that um but um so he's able to log in I additionally this is something that we learned today thank you to CJ from the coding Garden who was uh helping us with our setup this morning if you're not familiar with CJ he knows everything apparently um but you find him on Twitch um but he helped uh show me how we could set up a shared server so in addition to Raphael being able to see and live edit the code my server that is hosting the page here is actually also being shared with rapel so he can see in real time the results of the sketch so we're going to attempt to Live code and and make something together today with these tools so uh I guess before we go on Rafael did I miss anything important about this setup anything you want to talk about from your end that would be useful and if people have questions about how we're doing this setup uh beginner total beginner questions about like what is index on HTML anything is welcome here today as a question um yeah no I think I think you said you said it all uh the used live share before but I hadn't used the shared server thing and that's that's great that really makes it one thing is that uh you can't so you have a live preview set up inside of vs code and because um I'm in a virtual workspace on my end of things I don't get to do that uh the extension doesn't work so I have the preview up my setup looks pretty much like yours but I have the preview open in a separate browser window so I just arranged my windows uh the the advantage of having it in um in vs code directly is that you don't have to manage those windows there everything is in there and you can quickly tab between the two um and also uh if you're have some experience with web development and you want to use the dev tools you can do this from inside the inside vs code as well which is great you can have it at the bottom where the terminal would normally be uh yeah that's um that's also some little extras oh yeah so that's one thing I didn't consider so when I'm in the P5 web editor I will see console output here um you can't see this Raphael but I'm showing the P5 web editor right now um and then of course if I'm doing like sort of uh other kinds of web development things I'll just and say I'm using the Chrome browser or Firefox whatever I'm using I will go to view developer uh developer tools to see the console and other tools so if I'm here in Visual Studio code where can I see cons console output debug console that must be it uh so if I put in like console log Cho Chu oh I I still have by the way GitHub copilot is installed and active right now I think we can make the decision of whether I should turn that off or not I probably should uh but let's just see so I'm not no debug console doesn't seem to show that let's see where do I look um do you know do you know for live uh preview uh sorry I was trying to turn off GitHub copilot on my end but it says I have to reload and I don't want to reload because I would be disconnected from the live share so yeah here's a new thing I'll just pretend I don't have it um sorry you were asking I'm trying to figure out where I put a console log in setup and I'm trying to figure out where I would see the output of yeah so not there but if you go to your live preview all the way to the top right you have a little menu a hamburger menu yeah uh so if you click that you should be able to open Dev tools oh I don't see it I see the like little three dots oh no hamburger apparently I think I no no I understand now a hamburger is like a sandwich so it's the horizontal lines with slices something in between that's what this is okay yes open tool spade ah okay oh my goodness it's huge so let's see if I can uh and I oh this is just literally okay great so now I wonder if I can move this I don't mean to like obsessively waste our time you can move it so now in the dev tools you have a a three dot menu yes that you can move it around like you do in Chrome yeah yeah okay let's see oh but I don't this is oh okay wow so many things all right we're going to try it like this and we'll see how this goes um okay yeah oh uh all right so now I've got everything going I've got my file system index HTML sketch JS CSS file you know dare I say what's what's the probability likelihood of us writing any CSS today less than 1% unless I'm really allowed to use GitHub copilot it might increase uh and then here I've got the P5 code set up and draw the preview pane where you're seeing the red background and then over there all the way on the right is where if I were to uh let's just change the background color so it refreshes Dev tools failed to load wow look at this so I need to turn off the warnings um let's see if I can do that there's I know I've done this before uh uh verbose take off warnings take off info and there we go so I am now getting just the uh more sort of traditional uh error messages I'm just trying to like get the layout going here I'm gonna get this perfect everybody don't mind me ah okay uh unexpected token at sketch line where's my syntax error I don't see a syntax error what am I missing it's funny it's maybe that's just old oh yeah that's just old okay left over there we go okay now why how come I don't see console log Cho Chu there's only uh info aho oh because it's a live preview injected script okay I'm not going to worry too much about this right now we I'm G to uh close the dev tools and we can uh use them as needed okay I should put the console sha shank is suggesting in the chat that I put the console in a different window well I'll come back to it and figure that out as we go so we have to talk about what we're going to make oh maybe as a start SP all the time we spent all the time talking about the setup and figuring out how to do this we have no plan of what we actually want to build but we have a plan of how we want to go about it so yeah that might be the right time to introduce that right and I also had kind of like a starting point that could get us going here which is so you know coding train the symb of the coding train is the choo choo train if you will um as you saw uh from one of the wallpapers this like beautiful combination of the rubber duck bird BB like thing uh with the train wheels so um maybe maybe Rafael I know I know this is a processing Foundation stream we're doing here but since it's you and it's me I've got the train symbol maybe you could talk about where the bird or the BB if you will comes from um and May we that could be our starting point to make something yeah I I I just uh I just love drawing drawing BBS it's been my uh it's been my goto uh kind of pattern thing to draw forever actually recently I was in uh I was in France for for the holidays and like helping my mom clear some some old papers and stuff from from shelves uh and uh one of those one of those was one of my ear BB drawing so I could I could show it but let me see where I posted it I think in my random in the random channel in my uh uh in my Discord or where was it uh no it was in the BS channel of course it is so if you can give me the scene the share the scene share let's see let me get that back to you there you go yeah so so yeah there that's that's my uh that's my oldest b b drawing but yeah it's kind of the theme uh the also like all the uh the emotes are BBS and uh and I'm not sure where to where to show people some of the some of the drawings it took me by surprise I I wasn't prepared to show my drawings but yeah the the ah I can't see the the cover there either uh yeah announcement uh yeah there you go that that's a good example that's uh so you go from the previous one to this that's my that's how they look now okay so yeah I basically I mean this is uh I think what's interesting about it is probably that you know at some point a few years ago I needed to feel I needed to reconnect with my creative self and I wanted to do this in a way that didn't involve computers um and I remembered this thing that gave me joy which was to just doodle BBS and so I started doing that and then it bring it got back into the computer but that's um uh that was a time I needed to have a creative Pursuit that was just me and a piece of paper and so so yeah that's uh that's it I I feel antire pages with tiny BBS uh if I if I'm bored and I need something to do with my hands amazing um um I don't know this might be too elaborate to to to start with but so I have this uh and I'm I'm switched back to my screen here I have this sketch this P5 sketch which just has some basic shapes on it which creates the uh little coding train image I don't know maybe we could somehow make a BB coding dream sketch or or but what we what we ultimately want to do is take suggestions from the audience so I don't know what uh what what what what strikes you as a of of a way of getting started here rapael yeah do I do I have a BB made out of code I'm not sure maybe we should make one maybe that's maybe that's what we can start with a chew a chew BB yeah a Cho chw BB yeah yeah no I'm I'm down for that uh we can I was going to say audio reactive but that might that's always complicated if you're trying to right for streaming yeah that's always the problem when you have a camera input or something but yeah so maybe not for now but yeah yeah yeah just animated verb so I'm gonna bring this in for a second or BBS on a train yeah that could also be a thing so and I'm goingon to take out uh oh this is kind of weird with the SC I was going to take out all of the lines and maybe we can make these circles into BBs well as is suggesting January speedrun but that's a little bit hard to just pull off off the cuff like that last time when I did the JY speedrun I I had a I had um a cooler with sandwiches and everything I had I prepared I I went shopping for groceries especially for the speed run was maybe a little of a kill but it did take six hours we don't have six hours Unfortunately today so but uh janary speedrun why not might be forthcoming maybe we do a maybe we do one where where we race each other to the Finish Line all right I've I don't know what I'm doing here but I I was starting with some of the shapes that were in the um coding train logo and making them into a BB I was GNA move these could be the eyes yeah Kate we did the we did the January speedrun last year I I started it and then Dan uh Dan beat my my uh my score my time by by about two hours which was very embarrassing well no I I I I might have had the uh shorter time score but you had the higher quality score for sure it's they're inversely proportional to each other it's it's very subjective ah Buras exhaust from the train yeah ah oh okay uh somebody says your audio is a little low is it low compared to me or is it just low because then that's you okay I will turn it up a little bit more um okay so um I like this idea of what of well I feel like what we need is something that I think what would be fun here is if we're each doing a different piece that they somehow are supposed to fit together so what if I I'm trying to decide like one idea could be you know one of us makes the train and the other one makes the burs maybe we in that I have to make the birds you make the train I don't know um or the other way around class Kathy you have to let Dave's messages go through I know I know they might look like spam but it's a whole thing Dave got hid in by our uh incredible moderating team okay okay you work on the I'm gonna go back and get my okay so I have I'm I'm gonna just look for something that I've been working on this is maybe this is cheating though if I bring in something that I've been working on already um because I have a yeah this is too elaborate what I'm working on and I can't even find it anyway okay I'm going to make the train you make the BB but I'm I'm going to get my this okay ah I have some nasty auto complete uh I keep doing the same thing hoping a different result this is H we know what this is so okay let's see here uh all right uh I got to get this train to show up oh I think if there's unfinished code okay I gotta there we go okay so what my attempt right now is to uh I'm gonna try to rescale I have a Json file I should have I should have done all this stuff in advance but I'm going to rescale this logo multiply everything by four uh because that's what it should look like um so I'm going to do this math math in my it's a terrible idea uh okay so let's see H stroke weight 12 oh this is uh and now um I am going to move these lines around uh times four okay let's make this a function I I I I I think I have an idea yeah we'll make a I I got it I got it everybody it's going to be fine oh no I lost the colors but yeah I got I'm making a train class uh go away GitHub copilot don't worry it's going to come back I'm going to put all of this code for drawing the train in uh in the train Class by the way I never it's interesting you called your function display I'm always calling my functions show or render now because like I think there's some JavaScript keyword somewhere that's display and I once ran into an issue um okay so now trying not to make it draw so it's not confusing with the existing draw Loop but yeah good to know uh class train uh train. show okay okay so now my train is visible but I would like to have a uh um I would like to have a a location for the train and somehow now translate to that location before I hit scale um so this is good so what if I were to make the train at 100 100 but I want it to be centered so oh no my changes don't get uh my changes get cancelled why I don't know I feel like there's some uh some versioning issues ah it's it keeps going back keeps rrolling back oh you know what might be happening I have this like in this like uh uh uh just this instinct to hit command s all the time and I wonder whenever I hit command s it might revert oh deom is saying they you've already done the math I did too I have a repo where I set up this whole elaborate thing with the math for the uh logo and a whole set of objects for each component of it I just was afraid to go grab that now but maybe you have something simpler that I could use um what is the width and height is what I want to know um so I'm going to make the size four for right now and so the scale is going to be this do size and then what I need to do is translate to the x minus I just have to guess what the like if I knew I mean that's not right but like what is the width and height of this natively without the scale um so like for example if I want to have it essentially at train dox equals Mouse X I'm gonna not hit save anymore I'm GNA just force myself not to hit save train. Y is mouse y so now I'm moving the train around but I want it to be centered around the mouse so how am I going to figure that out right now you can see that it's offset let's make the size of the train a one and we're going to get oops that's the BB uh we need the size so now how do I get the train to appear at the center of um to here at the center um of the mouse I just need to know the width and the height so what is the minimum X the minimum X looks like uh [Laughter] 22.51% there's nothing oh my God this is crazy let minimum y I think chat uh Co pilot is like uh wi equals Max x minus Minx it knows what I want to do uh how do I I really want to turn it off I feel like it's uh uh okay so then if I translate to this minus W / 2 minus h / 2 uh that didn't work what did I miss I must not have the minimum X and Y correct oh yeah coordinates should be relative to the center of the train it was accidental Kathy's ban of uh Dave was accidental we're now finding out okay uh okay wait wait wait wa wait so I have the train is not what did I thanks to Fabio and Frank for the donations minus oh because oh it's this is actually the the points aren't even relative to oh this is so weird because the way this logo is drawn is to be Center in a like 100 by 100 so click on the bottom right copilot icon then click disable copilot pilot Dave asked an interesting question do you find that you get sort of good at estimating distances in pixels uh I don't know about I I know exactly what you mean although I would not claim to be good any is this copilot uh copilot disable completions let's try that okay so I turned off copilot now I'm on my own people we're on our own copilot is off um okay wait I have to think about this I need to do I need some pencil and paper if my train I know the oh okay so if the train is here I need to know what is the ah I need to also offset it by got it it's actually weirdly oh it's really just going to be Max X and Max y I think yeah well it's not exactly right but close enough no I should be able to get it closer than that that uh what am I what am I missing here uh and I can't like Zoom back out so okay I'm using my pen and paper again people to figure this out I'm trying to get the train if I know first of all I don't I don't know if my width and height were actually my Min and Max were actually correct so this is the lowest that's the highest X and the lowest y oh but the highest Y and the lowest X would be so 7 6 78 not seeing a point that's bigger um so the first thing what is the top left U of the of the Train the top left is yeah it should be the minimum X and the minimum Y and so okay I have an idea minus Min y yes yes yes minus Max x ided two minus Max y divided two there we go got closer I really thought that was gonna do it right because oh no no no no yeah no no no I got it I got it I got it I got it uh I got it I got it everybody minus Min X I got it this is going to be it I got the math here everybody with there we look at that everybody my train is now centered yes that took me way too long to do okay but I have the train centered so now I can make a train of any size and I can start to move it across we're going to make it a train at zero a height divided by two and then I can say train dot should I give it like full steering Behavior no I think I'm just gonna right now say train dox equals train dox plus one okay rapael I finished my part are you done yet I'm joking I need to make I should make the wheels spin I should make the wheels spin that that would that but then you would need to change the design so we can actually notice yeah uh right also the way the circles are they're not drawn oh yeah okay okay let's change let's make the wheel let's add some spokes I'm gonna add some spokes to the wheels so uh um let the my B looks like an umbrella now it's not good is yeah okay so wait I'm thinking about this let's say I'm going to have an angle that starts at zero that goes up by um some amount let's do like you know pi divided by 8 or something and then I'm going to draw I'm gonna say push I'm going to say pop I'm going to translate for this circle to here uh and say push and pop here do I have my uh wheel back we have an error somewhere in our code but I I don't know if it's me or you this is one of the I lost my Dev console I should open it back up no mine works uh what do I have going on here push translate okay let me just comment this out all right let's see if we can find we got to find where something went wrong I'm gonna open up the oh something interesting happened I don't know why now my translate I think you missed a push pop somewhere because my verbs getting and translated oh I did I definitely did okay hold on makes it look nice though I got it back but I'm wondering why okay so I'm gonna move this Dev console to show to A A Different yeah let's open it up as a separate window and then I'm G to go back to uh default and if I hit refresh here I think I think I just got I think my live preview got stuck I'm afraid to disable my live preview or restart it okay hold on this might mess something up for you I'm gonna start and stop the server do you see things I don't see things anymore I I have to reload manually every time but it does work for me okay hold on I closed my live preview by accident okay okay uh live preview stop server start server Dave is saying like yeah at some point at some point Raph that's me asked if we could add an error if you have mismatched push and pop one the one of these days I should get around to adding that yeah that would be fantastic because that's a common source of Errors for for well I was going to say beginners but everyone is that if you use a lot of push and pop and you have no not as many pops as you have pushes then uh then your code might still run but you're going to have uh it's going to start growing growing growing growing and and eating up all the memory and getting very slow and you don't know why and it's actually Prett well I was going to say pretty easy I don't know how easy it is to implement Dave can tell us but uh but yeah the naive approach would be just to say like how many pushes are in the code and how many pops and if it doesn't match then you have a problem oh that's the small circle okay can you still still hear me Dan I don't know yes I can still hear sorry I was lost in my own world of making spokes for the wheels nice yeah yeah no I I can feel the blanks that's I'm totally fine with that just wanted to make sure yes yes thanks and thanks Eric for the donation can't wait to see wings and bird head added to the train well I'm making the head it's it's taking a while but but I'm making the head line so I'm going to do this do s um oh yeah you can't see what I'm doing though but that's fine so so I have my BB is like one Arc and then two lines on the sides which took way more like way too much time for such a simple shape but yeah I'm going to add a beak could have some more BBS coming out of train chimney I lost the I lost things again I don't know why this happens let's see is there an error developer tools ah oh uh line 38 there's an error in line 38 ah oh it's just you type we're good we're good oh is it oh yeah 30 uh I'm on fine it's just this is the confusing thing about coding together uh okay so I'm just gonna keep going yeah yeah it's back it's back okay and I need to do the bigger circle is actually the one that I want to do and I'm G to be doing some things that might mess you up but I'm going to get them back okay where is okay ah I have a spoke and the spoke has to go to uh okay now there we go okay have a Spoke everybody now what I need to do is uh rotate by uh pi divided by 8 and oh the pop is here um oh that's because I oh I see rotate by a okay it's fine there we go okay I made my spokes oh franchello says Wheels have to spin at different rates because they have different sizes yes oh though don't worry that's gonna happen wait what did I do wrong here okay uh so now I need them to also be offset by the speed okay so we need the train needs to have a speed uh this doped we're just going to set it to one we're going to have an update function we're going to say this .x plus equals this.p speed I'm going to get rid of that in draw by the way nobody I realize that people don't really seeing what you're typing um because because they're seeing where I am but that's fine yeah that's okay I was I was gonna say I saw also an interesting point uh question in the chat um Matos is asking why so many Magic numbers can I has hasard a guess which uh I'm assuming that this was drawn in some software like inkscape or illustrator and exported as as and so I I what I really should if I had thought about any of this in advance I've been working on a basically like a Json file that has all of the details of the design and then I have this uh class which loads it all into individual components and resizes all the geometry so I really should be using that because I but um such is life okay so now what I don't understand is why oh not this not this. speed okay we need a oh the wheel needs its own I guess I could do like uh all right we're going to do an a I'm going to give the train an angle this is a little so like wheel angle I'll just call it angle because maybe I don't need other angles is zero and so in update uh the angle is also going to change by the speed but maybe since this one radian is a lot let's do the speed divided by like 10 just for now and then that angle that I'm rotating can be the offset okay why did that break everything this do angle this do angle equals zero that should work have to wait till Ro my finishes typing for S to come back it should be fine I'm trying to match your uh the stroke weight but for some reason doesn't not sure what I've done you're scaling by four and using a 2.9 we've really like uh I I really messed things up by starting with this train right I should have just made something much simpler I should maybe we should maybe I should start over I should just make a rectangle with two wheels this elaborate design well I have very elaborate very elaborate BB as well as you can tell ah okay ah there's my spokes again okay so my spokes are there now why is my offset not working was I doing it with the wrong okay hold on let me get rid of of the spokes for the other for the other circles so I'm not confused okay so why does it not work to say. this. angle why is that that should just be a nice offset of everything oh there we go I think it's just because we're coding the there we go yes the wheel is spinning now actually like that oh yeah that's quite nice um thank you Kate for joining um okay so now do I dare add spokes to the other Wheels I don't see why not I mean it's just the copy pasting my code that's the way you're supposed to do this kind of stuff right you just copy paste your code all over the place that's good that's good right okay oh so now uh this has to be four 516 okay and stroke weight gonna have a I'm gonna have my bur blinking with the good old uh frame count modulo in inferior to one trick yeah so I'm doing it twice at twice the speed that's going to work um where is the other wheel wheel one wheel two wheel three I know random random oh noise all my wheels are turning now so what I was thinking of doing was having the BBS come out of the Smoke Stack if you will of the train may we need to make maybe I need to make a scene for the train because right now and and we should give ourselves a little more space I'm G to make the canvas 600 by 400 and I need to see like I'm gonna make it black just for a second okay um 51 used to be the color of choice for the coding tray nice know why okay so now let's make a um oh oh no okay oh the train is now Center so what if I I think I should just estimate it um let's just do a I really just want to like have it like drive over a curve so okay so here are some ideas uh I could well first I need to have the train uh let's have the I think the train is going a little bit too slow frankly so let's have the train go where's its speed Set uh twice as fast that's better and then if it gets to I really need a width and height of the train but I'm just going to do this just like set it off the screen okay uh oh it could I could have it snow but the train let's make sure the train comes back okay okay so the train is going I feel like I either want to have it I think I kind of want to have it drive along a curve but that's kind of nuts I guess I could make a sine wave all right I'm going to try this this is this is a terrible idea but I'm going to do it anyway or I'll do pearlin Noise Okay I'm going to make a little mountainous but a train goes on his flat train doesn't really go up and down there yeah there are some like how are they called uh oh speed divided by the radius of the wheel that is smart okay I think it'll be interesting to see you have this you have this uh elevator train that goes uh it only goes in one straight line I'm I'm curious about this so I'm GNA do I'm GNA make a variable called terrain and uh terrain is going to be is going to be have a a y value that's based on noise and then I'm going to try to draw this terrain just do this a little bit more space here I'm St standing in front of the code I can make myself smaller okay and then um we're going to say vertex okay so x equals i y equals we're going to take the the noise value and map it I mean I'm just going to multiply it by height since the noise is between zero and one so vertex X comma y uh no fill can I get it back I've got to wait now I'm waiting for the code to reengage let's see is there an error somewhere line 26 oh it's me no that I don't know but there was uh I don't know there was some kind of Auto oh did I hit save again if I hit save it reformats the code yeah yeah there's some prettier stuff happening I'm not sure if it but it should break anything I don't know I've been afraid to hit save but I want it save now I lost a part of the burb for some reason that's my I think anytime I hit save it somehow seems to overwrite things that you're doing and I'm gonna have to restart the server again I think I'm not sure it's it looks like it should be there but it's not appearing okay I got my terrain back okay my terrain is there awesome okay so now I'm going to have the okay so first thing I need to do is I don't need a single I don't want like a x value for every um for every pixel so I'm just going to have a a like a step size is five uh okay and then uh then xals I times step and then I want the I'm going to do map because I would like the terrain to go just between like height divided by two and height okay so there's my Terrain now I need the Train's y position to look up to get its y position uh okay so uh let the index equal the Train's Exposition divided by the step size and I need to floor that and it's y position should be the terrain uh index oh this doy uh how come that didn't work this dox what did I do wrong here bicular that's true JL the terrain is is uh am I not oh because of the this stuff no that shouldn't matter because it's the Y okay hold on uh let's just say mouse y for a second uh oh okay so that work works the train is no why is the train no longer at the center what did I change I have to look at the developer tools I'm so not used to working like this okay so this makes sense it's looking into the array okay and then it is uh let's look at the terrain the terrain array should have oh the terrain array doesn't have the mapping in it oh what a I'm so silly I'm so silly no wonder that's so obvious let's do the mapping here uh and that way uh Y and now here should have okay so we're mapping the noise of I divided by 100 okay great so now my train is following the terrain but it's off it's like not properly centered I think I'm just going to like fake this I'm G to I know I'm going to rotate it next oh um but why is it not it should be centered right around what did I do that broke the centering of the tree do you have a translate in there that's not pushed and popped Poss I'm wondering because I'm not am I using translate I'm push I'm gonna comment out your bb just for a second yeah just go ahead except now I have nothing again okay okay so you no it doesn't seem like your bb is I don't think so yeah okay so what just curious again to set the XY to the mouse X and Y again okay yeah I lost whatever I had done previously that had the train perfectly centered um and I really should these should be Global variables oh wait a second I think I know the issue I know the issue I am doing that trans no I'm doing that translation um before I do the scale okay so I think this happens okay I think boy this is really insane what I'm doing uh oh I can't undo oh no what well I think I might have undone something you did because I was trying to do undo what I did but I think it there like multiple typing things going on so undo does not work the way that it normally works but it's fine I can get it and I typ and I typed uh this do s divided by zero so you know we're all struggling here okay okay so I just need to get it back I have an error here okay uh line sketch line 60 there's something wrong on line 60 ah you have got an extra slash here I'm fixing it okay line 60 I fixed I fixed that error okay we're back I don't see anything on the screen but I've got the background again okay um is not what I just want to see the train again uh Min X is not oh this is my fault uh where is oh right right right right oh no I lost my is it still in my oh no I lost my V somehow we I lost all of that okay it's okay everybody we're gonna have to get this back I I don't know this uh live share is meant for people to actually write code in the same file at the same time no it's definitely not we're definitely not doing we're definitely not doing what it's meant for but I have mys right where you ask question at people code but yeah I'm I'm I might have to turn copilot back on okay wait no so I can I can get these numbers again I'm gonna do this all in the train Constructor this. Minx I'm gonna I'm going to give a shout out to Kieran for for the donation Max X donations are still coming in I need a Max X which I think was 78 I need a doing in a standalone file that might not be a bad idea since we can't show it on the screen anyway I know I was thinking like oh I can't break things down to separate files but obviously that would have really helped I could still do it um uh that now I'm looking for the Min y 44 44 for the lines uh 27 stman y the stop Max y where's my highest uh 66 is right now highest 67 this circle is higher but 68 67 oh there's these lines uh oh no this is what I'm looking for 50 the last in the lines it's the last value give me something super high okay let's try this 59 I guess I'm gonna have to do this 67 yeah this is fine this is not perfectly accurate but it'll get me somewhere okay the train is back now I think I know what to do translate then do the scale then translate by negative this okay so let me just get the the width the Train's width Max x minus Min x uh and the Train's height this is ridiculous what I'm doing uh and then I am going to uh after scale translate by negative this.width not too exponential gez negative this. height so that's getting me closer but that's fine that's not this actually goes by two two and then I'm also going to translate by negative this. Minx negative this. Min y okay I'm back to drawing the train at the center everybody now what I want though is for the Y to be um I should really work on my train in a separate file too should I go and do that I'm going to do that yeah I moved my BB code to uh the TR is going into a separate file it's going to break things for a minute here train. JS okay and then index.html now just a quick time check we said we were going to stream for two hours I don't have a hard out but we should work toward the goal that we're gonna finish up at some point soon uh yeah what's a realistic goal now yeah uh okay hold on let's get the code back to working again okay so the train I can now be in a separate file do we have an error going on pallet is not defin at bb. show I think you lost we lost like the pallet oh oh yeah no we did I was copy pasting it right now oh uh ah yeah no I need to yeah because if I was putting it outside of the well it still should work as a global variable outside true and that def what you did now definitely won't work unless you do this this dot pallet uh and this the pallette Instead This is actually fun now I this is actually what I should have been doing all along I'm just watching you code and I could just a backseat Drive no no no you made a mistake fix that you did it wrong uh yeah and oh it still broke pallet is not defined where do I do I still use pallet uh this do palette palette palette palette uh what or does it where is it BJs 15 no there's things I don't trust about this weird process of live preview and live share yeah it's it can be a bit Jank but but now it's good uh now it's now it's running and Dave was suggesting some weird some weird blinking uh mechanic that I don't fully understand two sine waves with a slight offset in their wavelength so it blinks when either reaches zero is and they drift in and out of phase I got I I I I feel like I understood it up to the point where where they drift in and out of face oh oh wait okay so two sine waves that are slightly off and when either of them reaches zero okay It's Tricky making ice blink is uh is is harder than you'd think at least to make it look re sort of realistic but still organic my live preview is like I'm having to refresh okay I've got the train following the terrain perfectly so I just for it to actually live on the terrain I need to um I need to uh change the translation to have it be drawn relative to the bottom okay no that that's relative to the top oh yeah so just take out the divide by two yeah my live preview is no longer working okay my train is following the terrain look at that look how beautiful that is now I'm going to rotate it I think I should make it a little bit smaller it's too big relative to the terrain uh we can we can put the BB now uh we can try to attach the BB to the train oh my God okay so sorry I something has happened here which I heard a very loud noise like a earthquake kind of noise I'm in a garage and on top of this garage on the roof of the garage is approximately two to three feet of snow and it just started falling off so I'm like looking out of a window over there and I see this huge literally an avalanche of snow falling off the roof of the garage I I you snowed into the garage now are you going to be able to get out no I could get out the I I'm pretty sure the door will be clear on the other side if snow doesn't doesn't slide off on the other side yeah well I guess I'm here streaming all day okay wait I need to rotate the train uh let me go to sketch here change the size of the train to smaller is that the size or is that the speed yes okay so so I have a little small train no I just need to get my train to rotate while it follows the terrain then we can start putting the BBS or whatever we want to do coming out of the train I feel like the colors maybe it was better with white I don't know oh okay hold on I'll just leave it as black for right now that's what we're doing okay so now what I need to do the last thing I need to do is in the Train's C Cod I'm getting the index so I need to get index minus one and + one this is crazy what I'm doing but I'm going to do it anyway I need to get oh so angle should be the wheel angle so this is actually just the wheel angle because I'm G to have a different angle now and where are wheel angle we real angle okay so now what I need to do is I need to get the point from before and after the train so uh this.x divided by step I'll just do the one I'm just going to do the one after a next index equals uh I just oh actually I can just do index plus one what am I even doing so so I'm going to make a vector okay so I'm going to get uh next y equals terrain index + one that's the next y then I need to make a vector I need to get the angle so the vector is going to be uh I'm going to make a vector which is uh DX equals the uh next uh this.x plus step Dy is uh oh no that's next it's actually DX is just the step size it's always the step size Dy is next next y minus this doy and then I need to create a vector out of those components and this dot angle should be that vector's heading so now I need a this dot angle property and then when I right before I draw the train I should be able to say whoops I should be able to say rotate by this dot angle this is my last little piece didn't work but I'm not convinced sometimes oh yes it's working I mean it's not doing it correctly look at the TR following the terrain what's going on so I think it might so first let's just try like do I do I have an off by one a directionality error no can't it looks like the rotate translate order isn't right for that yeah pretty sure that because I'm drawing it relative to the okay hold on let's try right because this was the center oh oh because I'm I want it to rotate from the center but then I need to shift it oh this is so ridiculous okay I got an idea yeah let me just do this first okay so now at least it's rotating the correct angle ah there we go look at it following that terrain amazing okay but uh I need to shift it after I rotate it by a little more of the height right yeah it should be more it's it's not going to be perfect but you can see like uh and I think what I should do is actually lurp the angle uh equals lurp this do angle V do heading because it's kind of anticipating the angle by like uh 0.01 let's just see what that does oh sorry I'm uh I broke the code okay wait uh look no I broke the code we both broke the code my train is really trying to follow that terrain but something about it is like kind of off but you know kind of good enough I should just make it more abstract yeah why is it so okay so let's make the terrain less extreme I think that's I think this will be this will make things like feel nicer I think I need to make my font size a little smaller hopefully that's not going to uh mess things up too much for people uh to be able to see okay I need to where do I set the terrain values oh that's in that's in sketch. JS I need to hit save in sketch. JS hopefully that's not going to mess you up okay uh okay so my terrain yeah if my terrain is like less weird okay so this is good so why I think I'm just whoa it really doesn't I think the rotation like relative rotation is off but it looks pretty good still okay um oh longer terrain steps what if I make shorter terrain steps uh oh I broke something longer Terin steps yeah I like this okay now I think if I draw the terrain in a more abstract way it'll also um and what I need to do is uh vertex okay I need to do vertex width comma height and then oh and the terrain needs to be let do greater than or equal to and then uh vertex zero comma height okay so then let's do no stroke and uh let's draw the train after and I was going to try to make it fuzzier yeah see it kind of just looks like it's going over oh I have an idea Ellis I don't know actually I don't know it well then I can thank uh Carlos and David for their donations thanks you two okay I think I can be done with my dream we can start to connect these pieces uh yeah because the bird is so good right now I don't know what happened I I'm trying so I'm trying to do something I'm trying to get the neck to to get the BB to have like uh a neck that that elongates so I've organized my code a little better but it's still doing something weird with I'm not sure where uh maybe you can help me find it out but so yeah in the BB JS if look into there I'm I'm trying I was trying to just translate the neck uh sorry the the the top The Arc the top of the B oh oh wait this is bet well this is almost better you have it here too oh yeah okay so I was doing it twice uh what's going on uh I like how it's like how about just making the second point for the angle calculate further down the length that's not a bad idea um the idea was that it would the bottom would stay the same place but then the whole thing would get longer uh I'm not sure why it's still like still getting translated down I I feel like I oh let's see now it's good oh and then put this back that doing nothing I'm afraid to hit save but I'm I'm having weird refresh caching issues like where I'm not really clear on when the code is being updated yeah if I press save here then is it gonna yeah I have to press save okay so I needed to save locally otherwise it didn't didn't do anything uh now the train is it's little its head is oscillating up and down only not the Train the verb okay yeah and then I'm gonna do the same thing for the eye and the beak okay so if you work on the BB design and I go to sketch. JS maybe I can make an array of BBS oh but the BB needs an X and A Y uh argument yeah it needs an X and A Y and the rest is uh and a size oh I see it just has it has defaults you you have this fancy coding thing where you give it defaults if you don't give it an argument okay so what I was going to try to do is make BS come out of the train yes okays so I'll work on that so I'm gonna make an array of BBS and uh what we're going to do is g to say let BB of BBS whatever BBS there are BB doow and uh for the BB I give it a an X and A Y and a size okay so what I want to do is let me just get the Y value from the train and the x value from the TR well I guess okay let's just do this uh verbs. push a new BB at train dox train doy let's see what happens there Moment of Truth I broke something I have your B.S as not saved which is but I don't think that's okay let's look at where the developer tools are cannot read properties of undefined push sketchs line 26 I'm reading push sketch 26 did I not make oh uh I forgot to make BBS and array there we go this is my my small little mistake okay okay I'm making way too many BBS so this is good though so I'm going to say if uh random one uh one is less than 0.1 so I'm only going to make a BB randomly every so often and then I need to make them much smaller okay so there I'm making the BBS I don't think yourh stroke weight is tied to the side yeah I was gonna I was gon to say that I need to I was to match your existing strokes but I can do it Min us train. height so the verbs are now coming out of the top of the train oh amazing okay so now I need to just have the BBS uh move and fade away so is it okay if I give your BBS a a velocity variable this is dangerous because I'm gonna start messing with your bb class uh yeah no that's fine I'll I'll I'll try oh I was trying to to make this well maybe you you touch the stroke weight as well I I'll let you I'll let you I'll follow you oh I didn't touch the stroke weight no but you can I tried do it okay I I made it dependent on the size but it doesn't look like it's really the right scale uh so hold on what did you have it originally at oh oh that's weird wait so now I see I'm following you and I see you in a bb. JS file that has a capital B but mine doesn't mine has a lowercase b oh so so I'm a bit confused how did you get to a BJs file with a capital B maybe you have uh do you have maybe like some automation that makes C Class files capitalized no mine shows as lowercase oops oh okay uh yeah I don't have an uppercase I mean that the name of the class is uppercase but okay yeah well uh yeah then I I'll just uh I'll just take the back seat and see and and watch you code for a second oh okay but wait all right let's get this so what did you have the stroke weight at before uh it was 2.9 because that's what I I copy pasted that from your side but it never matched for some reason that's fine and same for the scale so the size oh I see so what I the the the goofy thing that I did with the train is everything is tied to the scale so the stroke weight I see I see um the like the size variable is actually affecting the let's take scale out for a second oh I have to save okay great so this is this is this is uh actually maybe better because everything is tied to the size variable as opposed to being tied to the scale so now if we were to say stroke weight 2.9 like divided by this s it would technically work but maybe we don't we don't want it that small oh whoops hold on we lost what happened to oh did you take the main BB out no no I don't think so oh there it is it's back so strange um I like that size of the burb what size is that oh that's the default uh the default size of the BB oh my God my visual studio code keeps opening files in different places it's so weird Okay um I somebody was suggesting I think I can't find the message anymore but like I think the oh no that was oh yeah Alex was saying BP mindes so I don't know about minds but I was thinking like if instead of coming out of the train they were already like on the terrain like watching the train go by and they all have offsets in their in their animation like a forest you would be like the train would be going through a forest of BBS I feel like that super funny I like also rotate them to match the terrain so they would all like come out at slightly different angles we more or less have the building blocks for that already yes I do like that although I am now just like three lines of C away from getting them to like move out of fly away all right let's Okay okay but let's see hold on let's also you need to update them if they if they are to continue going up and down oh yes yes yes yes okay so ah why is my I okay I want to switch between the files okay so if I go to BB and I give it a uh a random vector and then in update we say uh and actually I shouldn't make it random let's just do like this way let's do VX equals random uh5 comma 0 and this VY equals random because it it needs to kind of go off in this direction and then if we say this dox plus equal this. VX this.y plus equal this. VY okay so why does the BB okay well I need to in sketch. JS update all the verbs yeah [Laughter] okay uh okay so now I think we can have it be a little more often and um we can like uh train X Plus train. WID that's divided by two what happened there okay that kind of looks like it's the right spot and now the BBS um so now what we need to do maybe is have the BBS uh Fade Out so is is there where are they getting their color and the other thing they could have is um an offset so that their animation isn't all synchronized everywhere like they're all blinking at the same time uh it I lost the code that I wrote again it like weirdly like reverted back to something else so I don't know what changed it's very I'm so thrown off by using this live share because all these things keep happening where I like the code is changing in multiple places and weird ways it does not work as elegantly as I might have thought CU now like what what just happened yeah I don't know I'm not doing anything right now I know no I believe you follow you I'm trying to just follow you it keeps like refreshing arbitrarily like I have it open in multiple places um I'm trying to close tabs so that I wonder if I should disconnect for like just to like finish this off okay but wait I just want to get back to what we had um why are the BBS coming out of strange locations what did we lose in the BB see look it like I haven't changed anything and all of a sudden this little dot of like unchanged code has come back and some some stuff that I CH oh there's like what is going on look this like this same line of code has been added hundreds of times oh my God look at this you don't see it because it's not in the Stream right now but like the like basic a ghost is in the machine okay I'm gonna disconnect from live share for a second yeah this try it has okay uh yeah session details okay I removed live share because that is crazy okay it uh now it's only in there one extra time okay the BBS are back it's back to the code that I had before so now if I go to uh give the BBS a lifespan of 255 now where do I get the oh the color is coming from the palet can I just in P5 add an alpha to every stroke let's find out like if it's it's getting a color from the palette can I just add a second argument we're about to find out you can no but you can do uh what's it called again fil no it's not filter oh set it what is the palette oh it's just an array of the strings of hex codes um ah what's what's that called again it's not color it's not filter uh so how would I have them Fade Out somebody in the chat is Gonna Know use P5 color set Alpha yeah but I have to make these all into a I was thinking I was thinking about tint yeah yeah Davis okay so I'd have to do like like does this work like this is sorry now you can't see what I'm doing I realized because I disconnected you no I can't Rel uh and stroke so this one would also be C the beak is pallette one I'm this is like the uh in most feel free to break anything like if you don't want to use the I'm staying true to your original code I will not break it I'm it was uh pallet one I I should probably make sure this works before I go through adding this to the rest of the code so we've got pallet one and now we've need uh I mean this is this is insane what I'm I'm doing I'm breaking all sorts of rules pallet two C3 okay I broke something an interesting this's an interesting tip from Emil who said click the three dots uh and enable lock group on the live preview this way it won't open code on the right lifespan is not Define oh this. lifespan cu the this do song uh line 34 okay we're back so now in update if I say this do lifespan minus minus they don't seem to be fading out that set Alpha didn't seem to work um okay let's just do something real quick I'm doing the head is the head fading out maybe it just wasn't fading out fast enough just start like say minus equal 5 okay maybe it just wasn't fading out fast enough yeah the whole thing's fading out it does work it does work I just was barely fading it out okay and the live preview doesn't seem okay so now the BBS are fading away uh and uh I can then in ah in sketch.jpg if BB oh I need to do another loop to remove old BBS so for I do like I think your idea actually the idea of having the BBS as the terrain was better but I was like on this track right that I couldn't get off we could we could do both like we can have the BS coming out of as the smoke BBS and then the The Spectator or forest or tree BBS okay yeah as they're flying we don't really see them like um stretch yes yeah okay so first I need to go through um all of the burs and I guess I could do like call like filter or something but um if BBS index I lifespan is less than zero then a BBS splice uh I comma y so this should I've got some error again uh cannot read properties oh of undefined reading lifespan sketch JS line 35 oh length minus one okay there we go Okay so now now uh Kathy was also suggesting that the terrain I agree be higher so that way we'll have I guess she was saying it should be lower so there's more but I think it should be SP um but I think there should be if we want to add the BBS in the terrain we should uh we should make them higher the terrain higher so let me just make the terrain so oh it's 250 so we're g to add the BBS to the terrain and then we're going to be done and I really I feel like I should live share you back in I I I I don't like that we'd had to disconnect that but it was it went off the rails um okay so where is the terrain I'm gonna map it between height divided by four and three times height divided by four okay and for people who are asking what we're doing I think it's a good point to to remind people that that all of this all of this that we're doing this this all this nonsense is for a good cause because we are uh we're streaming as uh uh a donation Drive in a way of sorts for the for the annual fundraiser of the processing Foundation which is the organization that supports development of uh many of your favorite creative coding tools well many I don't know but uh but some for sure and uh and does a lot of other things and in particular we're celebrating the 10 years of the processing Foundation fell fellowship and if you click the link that is uh in the pinned message you will uh get to the donor box page and there you can donate if you wish to do so but you can also um yeah see more uh find links that will tell you more about what the foundation's about and what we're doing and uh yeah and if you want to uh find out more about what we said about it you can always go back to the beginning of the stream and uh and listen to that thank you for that okay I think I got something here which is that let make the sky uh okay I'm gonna get some colors for us that's gonna really work wonders here the sky is g to be oh that can't be that purple I don't think I have yellow in the okay the sky is yellow and the terrain is going to be let's try this this could be actually a good blue color for the sky and it can make the terrain yellow yeah there we go this is good then the terrain could be yellow now the uh oh the BBS are a little bit off in their position I was moving the train down um so I let me let me fix let me fix this I'm G to put this back in and then uh and then I'm going to set the Y terrain index plus this do height divided by two whoops no no no no uh gonna draw oh my God I'm losing my mind here oh I know what to do and the next y we'll just do this here there we go I wanted the train to be further into the terrain because now you don't notice so much that it is uh not following perfectly okay so now we can add the BBS to the terrain that it's navigating through so those will be a fixed list well I'll just make another array called terrain bir BS terrain BBS of course and uh we will uh for the terrain let's say for every uh well let me just do it separately uh let's just add let's just try adding 10 of them right now terrain BBS push new BB uh R I'm just going to put them in random places an X and A Y which will be uh the X will be somewhere random and the Y uh the Y should be I'm just gonna I'm going to make it randomly within the terrain in a moment but right now I'm just going to put them anywhere so there's going to be 10 random BBS and we need to show those uh but they can't move so BBS of B terrain BBs okay so what okay one uh 20 now where are those BBS ah wait a second the terrain is needs to be at the start okay got it we've got all the verbs now uh the train should go here but now what I need to do is in the BB we need to separate out the move from the length thing so I'm gonna what what would you call that like the length thing that it's doing uh stretch or stretch okay I like that yeah so I'll keep this as update and now um the um the terrain BBS uh stretch okay where I've got an error B oh stretch is not a function yeah so I don't have that in I guess I have to refresh yeah okay okay great the terrain BBS are in a fixed location and they're doing their stretch so we're going to have to give them them different offsets but also I need to make them only within the terrain so the way that I'll do that is in the main sketch H in the main sketch when I pick their random Y location where do I do that here it shouldn't be random height it has to be from the within the terrain range so the uh terrain Y is Terrain index x / step with a floor there and then uh the randomness is between terrain Y and height okay so let's make more of them okay so now I know you can't see this so we've got the BBS in the terrain all oscillating up and down I feel like we could make their size a little random so let's try that uh random 10 comma 30 yeah look at that okay but now we need them to offset so in the BB class that's the length that's mapping sign frame count so we just need them each to be on a different offset so I'm just going to give them this. offset equals random 2 pi and the uh I'm just going to give this a temporary variable frame count time 0.1 plus this do off offset and then if I say angle here that should do it yes look at that okay I think we've completed this I think we should make it full but what I I will need to wait for the for for the stream to catch up so I can see the result but I I see I see some of it already it's really cool I'm going to now go away from live preview and what I'm going to do I think is put this into the web editor that way we can share it with people does that make sense do you think yeah yeah totally so let's go to the web editor and I create AET you have to create all the files again uh B decade of code with BBs and trains and then I need a uh verb. JS file and a train. JS file then if I go back here train. JS uh verb. JS uh sketch. JS whoops all right train is not defined oh right because then I need to add them to here to the index uh stop with the auto refresh train BB okay we've got it now here's oh there's a console log somewhere that I had left I don't know where it is let me find that uh yes get rid of that now what I would like to do just for the grand finale here is to uh see what happens if I go with window width and window height now we're not scaling things according to that and then hit share and go to full screen okay well I think there needs to be a lot more BBS in the terrain and the trrain could be bigger nice so dare I dare I attempt one last thing which is to make we we can leave uh we can leave a lot of those changes as an exercise to the audience okay but I just have to there's two things I could do really quickly one is to make the number of BBS relative to the size of the of the window so now that's that's done and I just want to make the train bigger and then I promise that's it so this should be well I'm just going to see what happens if I make this too uh it messed up other things but that's okay all right so I'll stop we have uh I'll make this full screen and uh hit refresh so now it's just you and me here Raphael watching the uh train pass through a sea of BBS amazing what a somehow there's still people here watching this yeah I mean I think so there's there are a couple things that people might want to do if they want to go and tweak that I was thinking while you were polishing things um the one thing that could be added oh wait could be could be randomized your your audio might have cut out for a second because I was pressing buttons ah okay no worries if you want so if you want to just start back with your suggestions yeah yeah so here are a few suggestions for people who might want to pick that up and maybe we can share the the link to the P editor sketch people can can copy paste it or like can duplicate it in their own collections um so yeah when you go there and you you can edit the code yourself in the P5 editor um you can make sure to check out the different files because we haven't used a single sketch file we have this BB class and this train Class it's not the cleanest code at least mine isn't um and uh but yeah so one thing I'm thinking is the the BB orientation could be randomized so some BBS look right some BBS look left right now they all look in the same direction um and another thing and that's a little bit more advanced but uh right now there a lot of them are overlapping so there are a few things you could be doing to um either you embrace the fact that they're overlapping uh and you could have like add some fill color matching the background to each of the BBS so that when they are overlapping uh there's always one that is in front of the other and the other thing is it's the trick that I've seen a few people do um in the coding challenges is um some to sort the the Z of the array based on the Y position so that you draw the on that are the lowest you draw them last so that's um that's so yeah you you take an array you check the Y and you you switch them if one two by two if one is further down and that's how you you end up with a sorted array based on the Y position um I haven't done that trick myself but I've seen it done by people and it works really well and that you would have to do this together with that um with that fill thing the other solution would be you don't want them to overlap at all and then you do some kind of um like Pon disc sampling or or uh space like other kind of space filling algorithm like Circle packing uh and this way they would all have like each of them would have their own little space and they would be evenly evenly um sprinkled through the landscape that's another another possibility yeah and and from the train some things for the train that I think would really improve so one is uh the way that the train is drawn relative to its Center and using the scale function in combination with translate everything that I did today was like hacking it together in this really awful way based off of this original hardcoded set of numbers so I think you can see how like the trains the way that it's following the ter terrain the way that it's rotating especially now that I tried to make it a little bigger scaling it relative to the screen dimensions is is way off so that could be um very much improved I just want to show people something in case you wanted in case anybody who's watching this actually wanted to work on that which would be shocking mind you but um if I go to github.com I've Been Working on uh this uh myself if I go to the coding train GitHub repos there's a new one that's kind of undocumented I haven't called um logo animations and in the logo animations repo I just want to show this to people because if I had been more thoughtful about this I would have used this originally I have this file called data. Json which actually has um all of the uh information it says like every element of the logo it's like the shape type the X and Y coordinates the color and then I even have this like program it's a node script that will parse that and re and recalculate all of the numbers depending on what scale you want or what relative position you want and then I think if I go into logo. Json it actually writes that out so this logo. Json actually has all of the properties of the logo itself now relative to the center with a different scale and I'll just show you what I've been doing with this just so you can see um if if you all don't mind uh indulging me for a minute here what if you look at this repo and I'm just going to quickly clone it and I'm sorry Raphael that you can't see this uh in real time um and I I should just Host this with GitHub Pages or something but if I go to this now like for example here is a version of the logo where all of the elements just start moving around and flocking individually uh here is a version of logo where just all of the pieces fly in and come together in a little animation and then here's another one which uh uses a physics library to have it like uh fall apart um when the logo reaches the bottom and everything bounces around so you could tell I've been I've been trying this is really what the thing that I'm working on and I me keep meaning to do some live streams about and integrate it's my idea for I'm I I Sor I'm off on this coding train tangent I know this a processing Foundation video but um so one of the things that I'm hoping to do is have little logo animations at the beginning of different live streams and coding Challenge videos so anyone's interested in that you might be able to pull from that and integrate it into here and have a lot more control over how you're manipulating the train um so what's the best way I I posted a link to the um P5 sketch in the chat um what I'll do is as soon as we're done I'll make sure the link to the sketch is also in the video description so it's there forever I'm trying to think if people make their own version of this uh what's the best way for them to share it back with us maybe I know social media is kind of like a fraught complicated space but where are you these days uh Raphael that um um you that where we might suggest people share back yeah I mean I I'm am ashamed to admit I'm still on uh still on Twitter uh been for years as well uh but um yeah also have a Discord channel uh disc Channel um Discord server uh called the BBS Nest uh where people are welcome to join and uh if they want to join my weekly challenge right now we're doing January so right uh the the weekly challenge is on hold but you can find it on Open processing um where it's uh it's pinned to the homepage uh and otherwise uh oh yeah no I don't have my somebody can share the link if if if it's allowed um but yeah that's also place where you can uh for the creative coders and I actually just remembered Kathy was helping who's in the chat and some other coding trained folks were helping with uh setting up a track look so um on the coding Train website um every there's a section called the uh passenger showcase which has uh it's a way for you to submit a P5 or or actually sorry doesn't have to be P5 uh any project and we can set up a page for this stream where you could submit uh versions of like like the the train BB the BB train um to that page so that's something that I could do um but I'm you know certainly on Twitter or I'm trying to get the coding train Instagram back up and running um that's a way that I can if you if you tag the. coding. Trin on Instagram but really share this with uh the processing Foundation this is all about I I we lost we lost the thread there for a moment this is really again just to remind you all this is all about the this stream today has been in celebration of uh 10 years of processing Foundation fellowships um we talked about this at the beginning of the stream but in case you weren't there the p5js project actually started as a processing Foundation processing Foundation Fellowship by Lauren Lee McCarthy um and um we played a video that you can watch if you go to the pin comment or the link in the video description if you have the capacity to donate and support the F proing foundation and the fellowship program that's wonderful um but please engage with the processing Foundation Community its program s uh with Raphael's uh twitch channel the weekly coding challenge Raphael's twitch stream and the BBS Nest Discord the coding train has all of that stuff too that I'm sure you can find because you're stuck here watching the stream on the cing train YouTube channel so all of that's going to be linked from this channel itself um any uh uh any last uh I guess we can sometimes I usually I I'm always having trouble ending these things so we could just say goodbye but rapael we can just talk for a minute and see if there's any I we could just give it a minute I see that seay is still in the chat uh so thanks seay for I'm I'm very impressed for anybody who mess made a wrote a comment at the beginning of the stream and is somehow still here uh so thanks for all of you for tuning in today any last words you want to say rapael well yeah thank you to everybody who donated today and before since the the beginning of the fundraiser it's going the fundraiser is still running for for another week uh uh so you just uh jump onto Don box check out the the video about the fellowships and everything the nice little uh merch rewards that we prepared for you including beautiful enamel pin by Anna careras uh and uh yeah um what else thanks to everybody at the foundation for all the work that that they do um and the people who have been with us in the past people who joined lately I mean I'm also joined um joined more recently and uh and yeah it's been an incredible experience everybody is really really dedicated to the mission of the foundation um which isn't uh yeah which isn't an easy an easy thing to do supporting open source um inclusion diversity equity in the in the open source space and in the Art Space um focusing on education there's there's no money in in education um and uh and that makes things difficult but uh we can do what we do thanks to the generosity of everybody who has been donating and has been supporting in in small and big ways contribution doesn't have to be monetary it does help for sure but uh people who contribute code uh there's like Dave here in the chat has been doing incredible contributions to P5 lately but he's far from the only one this incredible an incredible community of contributors to p5js and I know that people who use uh the tools may not always be aware of what happens behind the scenes but it's like none of that is possible without an immense Global Village of people who are donating their time their money their emotional energy uh everything so that this uh so that these projects can live and that uh the discords get moderated like everything is uh is possible because of people people's work um that is uh that is rewarded in various ways uh not always monetary and for for older people who are who are just so generous with their time and they're their genius uh yeah I wanted to to say say this word it's impossible to name you all but you know who you are so thank you yes and thank you so thank you Rafael you they put that all eloquently it's a perfect note to end on uh thank you so much for joining today I have to say this is a real pleasure I I've been uh the the work that I've been doing in terms of the Cod train has been quite slow for the last year and I'm I'm excited to 2024 is here I've kind of made it a goal to do more and I'm realizing well it's really nice to be streaming with somebody else so I know we've done a couple collaborations where I was able to appear on your Twitch stream and this has been great to do this together to celebrate the processing foundation so maybe we can do more of this in the future and hopefully shine a light on other people in the space who are making work with code and supporting the foundation in other ways so um I usually have a end animation screen and some music that I play but with everything that I did to get the multi guest set up today I kind of lost some other pieces of things that I usually have for my setup so I apologize I'm just going to literally hit a button that's going to just turn this thing off so um please if you uh if you were inspired to make anything with processing or P5 or any other tool maybe you want to can you make this in like uh Unity or uh maybe you could make an open Frameworks version of this I don't know so I I you know if you're just inspired by what we did today and make something I would really love to see it it always uh brings me so much joy to see what people are doing so please share with us in all the spaces we've talked about and I will see you all the next time live stream and yeah go ahead Rafael yeah in the chat just just wanted to highlight the message that Sig just posted chat so if you want uh if you need support for your projects and you want to
