so do check one two this is my mic coming through to you hopefully you hear me okay uh just to be clear i'll be on live on camera in about 40 seconds but this is not a coding train coding stream i'm just here to announce a couple things and then send you on over to see the wonderful projects from the students at the itp ima programs at nyu so oops 26 seconds left i got to get myself ready here oh the timer went down to zero oh look it's me hello hi everybody music has about 12 seconds in it um hello welcome i haven't done a live stream on youtube for a while it's because i've been streaming on a different platform i don't want i don't know if who's listening in here but you you can find me i'm sure if you just think of whatever popular streaming platform people might use and search search it up as the kids like to say oh i'm out of practice um so this is not your usual coding i don't know what your usual coding training live stream is by the way but if there ever is such a thing as a usual coding train live stream uh this is not it i'm just checking the chat here um because today is is extra special in fact i'm only gonna be here for like another 20 i mean i'm going to be here the whole time but i'm you're only going to be on this youtube account for the next 25ish minutes because there is a new feature of youtube called live redirect and as you might recall if you've watched the coding train for a while every twice a year i do i try to do a stream from uh new york university itp ima program at tisch school of the arts to celebrate the work of all the wonderful students there and i'm on sabbatical this semester and i'm not there because i'm kind of far in my new home coding train studio um so but i'm still here to send you over to the itv show because it's back there actually has not been a live inperson itp show since 2019. i think i did some streams for some of the online exhibitions and different things there was yorb and all sorts of experiments but they're there live in person at nyu and i'm gonna send you there with youtube's live redirect feature and then i'm gonna hang out in the chat and watch um so and so hi from the netherlands uh hi to france but before i do any of that i want to just give you some really important and exciting coding train announcements answer any questions hello to italy um and arsenal writes i literally had a dream about you last night can you tell it's finals week well if finals week causes you to have a dream with me in it then i suppose that all sounds good to me hi from south africa amazing uh i love how international the audiences i love that i get to connect with all of you this way these ways this way this internet way uh hi from patna um something thrills me more than uh seeing where everybody's from in the chat although i probably what would be nice is for me to come up with like interesting prompts and then everybody can share their answer to the prompt in the chat like what did you have for breakfast this morning uh i'll tell you what i had well i made um i made my son this sort of like scrambled eggs with olive oil and a little micro greens it's a little recipe we picked up from a tv show we were watching uh and then i had some cereal and blueberries with almond milk nothing too exciting and my daughter was like no breakfast not hungry nope all sorts of things offered nope no breakfast so you know this is the first meal of the day london england hi from nigeria hi from egypt hi from morocco summer says omg finally yeah i got the same feeling omg finally um all right so let me get to some important announcements uh let me go to i'm just pulling up the twitters because this is where i like to find my important announcements um and i'm just gonna here we go um coming over here oh simon is here simon i was just gonna ask where you were for some reason i in my head i thought you might be in connecticut but you're in boston so uh i do have a um some some exciting news that would have been more exciting just like a month ago crisscrossing the ocean atlantic here um but let me let me let me go in order of the things that are in my head the first thing i want to tell you about is p5 access day so the best place for you to find information out about p5 access day is at link to ee or linktree p5.js obviously you can go onto the twitters here and there's lots of wonderful posts about all the different uh moderators and speakers and folks that are involved with p5 access day it is coming up really soon it is may 21st um and it is uh you can rsvp right here so let's go to this link and take a look at it um there you go um you can find this rsvp link right here which would probably take you to an eventbrite uh more i'm gonna just accept these cookies here i love the internet cookies they're not as delicious as homemade cooked cookies i like a little vegan peanut butter cookie oh that's my favorite we got a good recipe for vegan peanut butter cookies please send that to me i don't have like a github repo for some crowd source collaborative peanut butter vegan cookie recipe but um all right uh naloxion says a coding train stream best way to end a long debugging day at work well i hope your debugging day was not full of total and complete frustration um so i do want to tell you about uh p5.js access day let's click on this link and head over to the eventbrite um and you can find out all sorts of information about the schedule about how to register um this is a virtual conference to talk about access in the open source software for the arts and greater issues beyond software themselves there will be theme sessions around critical web accessibility disability arts access and community building and access via translation so um there's i just can't say enough amazing things about all of these names of people who are speaking uh i know some of them well i know there's know of some of them i've watched some of their read some of their work watched some of their talks but um really just an incredible lineup of of speakers and moderators and topics so i encourage you to check this out and i um if you have questions about it um you know you can obviously uh you could tweet at p5xjs on twitter you could write to foundation processing.org which is just sort of a catchall email address for any queries that are going related to processing foundation activities okay so i wanted to mention that that's item number one announcement number two announcement i haven't gone to like any kind of conference or meetup or workshop or hack a hackathon or whatever you all are calling these things these days but i am going in june to copenhagen so let's see if i can find i don't have this url uh uh uh pc let's look pcd copenhagen um processing community copenhagen uh look at this there's me ha i'm gonna be there uh i mean i'm a little i'm always nervous like am i really gonna make it how's it gonna go am i gonna be okay but what's the plan instead i'm going i do have a plane ticket i will be there um so first of all if you are if you're in the local copenhagen area please come say hello i would love to meet you there uh you don't need to come just for me there's all sorts of amazing wonderful stuff that i'm sure will happen and the organizers are amazing and wonderful um thank you so much for inviting me and helping to coordinate this so i'm really excited to go i don't know what i'm going to do there exactly yet some kind of workshop or live coding challenge or something so if you have any ideas for me of all ears uh please let me know um and i noticed that like for folks like simon who um just moved back were probably within like you know a train ride from copenhagen and then now our you know a very expensive long flight away um you know if there's interest in these kinds of like little gettogethers and events i'd be glad to do something in the new york area for all of you who that might be convenient for i can think of all the places around the world that i'd love to travel to so um so that's coming up i wanted to make sure i mentioned that uh stig thank you for all your work uh organizing i've never also the other thing is i've never been to copenhagen i've never been to denmark northern europe i haven't been too many places i have been to norway i don't know i don't know if you really count germany up there i've been pretty far up in germany um but so if you've got any travel tips or suggestions i'll be there with my family and we're going to do some tourism stuff i'm really excited about experiencing all that copenhagen and denmark has to offer i'm thinking about going to sweden stockholm i don't know anybody got any suggestions um so let me know uh tweet at me or or however people get in touch with each other these days the coding training discord that's where you should go codingtrain.com discord so guess what how much time do we got uh 340. oh i have lots of time why is it that somehow when i do live stream where i want to code something i feel like i have these introductory remarks which somehow take an hour and a half and i'm like okay i've got 20 minutes left where i've got to go whereas today here i am uh but uh we got 20 more minutes here before we get to the main event of today come to oh genevieve oh man i so i've been to paris uh france i i don't want to say many times not definitely not getting above counting on one hand but more than two more than two somewhere more than two less than five and oh i absolutely love um love love to visit france love to visit paris um yeah so maybe maybe this trip maybe next trip who knows where i'll go from copenhagen so much as possible but thank you for that uh experience ah budapest budapest oh so many i have to go everywhere i just need to retire and travel the world that's my plan okay so those are my two main uh announced two uh sort of event announcements that i wanted to bring up p5.js access day as well as processing community day copenhagen i hope to i don't i hope to join for p5 access day online um and i certainly um as of now according to this photo we'll be at processing community today in copenhagen all right so are you ready because if you think those were exciting announcements i had a really exciting one for you like way more exciting than either well okay so first of all when i talk about something be exciting let's let's set some parameters here i'm talking about something exciting in the you know well small contained universe that is the coding train so you know it's all relative we're talking about things that are like exciting in life uh i don't know how well this thing that i'm gonna tell you measures up or stacks up to all sorts of kinds of things that i could think about that would be exciting for anyone but for coding train this is exciting come to egypt in australia or austria i'm not sure which that country was i can't really entirely see it i oh wait i'm about to present to you this is a very long sound effect a work in progress almost completed kind of in progress version of the new coding train website that's not it here it is um so here it is this is a quote you don't see that here it is going to press this button here is a preview of the new coding train website um this has been a project in collaboration with design systems international um and there's a lot more to say about it and the process and a lot of thank yous and but it is not launched yet it is uh only at this url right now coding train slash preview.netfly.app so uh but what i want to do and i i plan to actually do like a full stream about the website going through it and and kind of soliciting help with you know expanding the content and and um all of that kind of stuff so this is just a sort of sneak preview of the sneak preview sneak preview of the preview this is the trailer to the trailer uh the actual website the plan is to launch it officially finished at processing community in copenhagen uh uh roon matson who is one of the founders of design systems international is also one of the organizers of pcd copenhagen and um i'm i'm so happy to see these nice comments in the chat so this is a labor of love uh so much has been put into this and but it also is quite raw and missing a lot there's a lot of placeholder content a lot of stuff hasn't come from the earlier website but i want to show you a couple things so number one let's just go to um let's go to the i'm gonna go under videos under challenges oh shoot i forgot to upload a custom thumbnail for this and it also says video number so you can see i forgot some things here so these are things by the way that you can help contribute to now but you'll see um every coding challenge this is a list of of all the coding challenges it's not all of them it's just the ones that we've brought over to the new website if i go to uh image to ascii for example if i click on this you'll see the video here timestamps are here on the right these are still kind of these are the links to all of the source code description there's references of different links that appear in the video there are other videos that um there are other videos that this one refers to um so this is hopefully a nice way to organize all of the content and metadata on youtube now youtube is amazing for search and discoverability and it's the primary platform where people engage with the coding train but it's important to me to have a website where if you're watching something on youtube and you're kind of like lost in the sense of like well what if i want to learn this more in order or where's the source code for this or you're talking about all these other links and where do i find them you know video i don't know if you've noticed but video descriptions on youtube are being what i would i would characterize as being phased out like they're obviously still there but they're more and more hidden by the interface um the youtube does a great job of chapterizing with time codes so that's a wonderful feature but in order to be able to sort of like document all the ancillary material that i have with each video that's what this website is really for as well as this concept so this the challenges and then there's the concept of tracks so that's the new term for what might otherwise be like a course or a playlist or a sequenced content piece of content so you'll see here there's the nature of code track there's the uh start the sort of beginner code programming with p5.js track and the ideas i mean these are again some placeholder images and um but the idea is to fill this out with all the different kinds of collections of videos whether they be full sequence courses or just um you know for example something like this algorithmic botany track was calling that like a side track is like just a collection of all the videos that deal with fractals and fractal trees so if i go to for example the nature of code track you'll see here on the right all the stops these are all of the videos in order and so if you can click around these and you'll sort of see where you are again the code examples are below as well as the description references videos etc now if you thank you stig for answering i have somebody i don't know who can post dsi's uh the url for their uh company and the website but um in in the chat but please do it maybe i'll do that in a minute so now here's the thing that i'm really really focused on why i want to bring this to you and i'm just taking looking at the time because i got a transition to talking about itp in about five minutes if i go back to the home page here you'll see here under uh uh under here there is the passenger showcase highlight so this is a particular um fractaloid interactive fractal branches uh by diego de la fuenta coraccio based on the recursion challenge uh we can click here i don't know if this will actually work and go and see their work um and i'm gonna hit allow i was gonna use my microphone oh my goodness okay hello cool okay so i'm not oh there we go um so you can see this is based on one of the videos but it responds to mic input so you can have your work here featured on the coding train home page for every uh video if i go to this one for example oops page not found that's a bug somebody report this book did that happen uh so let's go back to challenges let me go to i know i'm pretty sure the prime spiral one has there we go has some community contributions nope so let's see again all in progress here this is a good practice for when i uh really get to it okay videos challenges let's see the slide puzzle has some i remember seeing those so if i go to this slide puzzle video and scroll down a little bit you will see here under the passenger showcase so this is where um if you have a project that you've made inspired by or related to the particular video you can submit it to be here and it one of the goals with the website was to have the passenger showcase be much more primary so you can have a thumbnail you can have a link to your own website or social media link to the actual project itself there's only two here but this this can go and be like an infinite scroll basically i don't know if they shuffle randomly or appear in order but i would love to love for you to do so now i don't know if this link goes anywhere yet yeah the submitted contribution link doesn't go anywhere yet and in fact the next important thing that i need to show you and there might be some questions um in the chat so apologies if i'm missing them um this is the github repo for the website so go to github.com codingtrain thecodingtrain.com i'm actually going to let the site take over the domain soon um and so that will encourage people to use it don't bother pull requesting and filing issues on the old website not necessary and you can first of all if you want to follow the work that's going on you can read through some of these issues here there's one open pull request which is a very important one for this discussion which is this is the guide there's going to be a guide on the website for both how it works and how you can submit to the passenger showcase and there's a lot more to say about that eventually i think the plan is to have a form you could just fill out but at the moment you would need to do a pull request so let me just show you where you would do that and again the goal here is for this to be a welcoming friendly place for people to engage with open source and contributing to a website in a friend a friendly way for total beginners if you've never coded if you've never used git or github before come and try to do stuff with me on the coding drain website that's the whole point you're like some like i've got 30 years of experience building websites and i'm i made git myself great you're welcome too but then you're not the primary audience primary audience is all of you who are just starting out uh and or or and or want to help others too you could be yeah that if that's your kind of thing that's my thing i mean i think that's what i want my thing to be um so showcase right so mate and i'm probably apologies if i'm mispronouncing your name mate is asking showcase will be based on pull requests so right now if you wanted to add and we're good we're slowly manually bringing over and we have some you know we might be able to automate this um but if you submitted a project to the previous website the goal is for that to make its way over but you're welcome to also just resubmit it again but basically if i go under content and let's say you wanted to submit let's say you recently watched the monty hall coding challenge which is my most recent i'm just moving some stuff over here the most recent coding challenge on the coding train if i go here to videos under challenges and i find did anybody see it monty hall monte hall monte hall monty hall there we go monty hall there is first of all there's this index.json file so this is actually all of the metadata and i'm sorry this is so small this is all of the metadata for the video so this is a static build website again lots more to say about that but you can just grab the whole repo you've got the whole website you can do a pull request to a json file fix a typo boom it's live on the website there's no you don't need to sign up test deploy server this run this it's just a static build website uses gatsby and all sorts of other amazing things that i don't really know uh so thank you to all the folks for doing the work so um you can see here first of all you can help to build out the content by adding if maybe i forgot to include a link to some reference that was in the video it goes right here but this is hard to see now but um because there are no contributions yet so there's the starting the first contributions you do a pull request for that but let's go to one that already has some so i will just go back to the and oh look at the time i will go back to which one let's try the mandelbulb yeah showcase so i got to stop saying contributions showcases the word so so first of all uh somebody wants to i forgot to um add the thumbnail for um so this is like the thumbnail here for the mandelball video it's just right here it's just a static jpeg file in the directory you want to you want to make a nicer thumbnail for me pull request a new jpeg i'm not saying i'm going to accept any arbitrarily redesigns of things but that's possible and here under showcase you can now see that to add your project all you need to do is uh create a json file it's a little this is a little bit clunky but um and obviously having the form might smooth some of this out but basically if i'm here i'm going to create a pull request with a file called contribution2.json um because they basically they're numbered and the numbers are arbitrary but that's the next one i wonder if it works if it's just any json file in its directory so you could like do it with your name but for now i'm like talking this through and thinking about it at the time basically you want to create a json file that's contribution too you can see what's in this json file you just need a title an author a name a url the url for the project and optionally uh source code so if you create this uh in a pull request a new file and by the way i can show i don't have time to walk you through this this is what i'll do in the next time i come back and do a live stream about this and then also if you create a jpeg or png with the same file name that will be your thumbnail that will show up with your contribution on the website so now we can see we can see that this is here and if i go to back to videos challenges and i go to the mandelbulb one we'll see here there is kathy's right here three color mandelbulb that was submitted to the passenger showcase so and if i click here right on this little play it'll take me to their project look at that amazing look at this by the way holy smokes nice job that is really really cool so there's more that i want to say about this what i'm going to do right but but i'm kind of i need to wrap up now because i got to send you over to the itp show so i'm going to do a couple things one is i'm going to grab this link here i'm going to go to the coding train discord so if you're not in the coding training discord somebody put that link into the chat and then i'm sorry i'm reading the chat and confused there's i guess there's some youtube twitch discussion going on oh i forgot to turn one of my lights on am i kind of dark today i don't know um but okay so on in the coding train discord which you can find by going to thecodingtrain.com discord i have to make sure that little shortcut url makes its way over to the new site um i i have under here under live a channel called links where i'll sort of post stuff when i'm doing a live stream so um let me post this is the link to the new website github repository you can download the entire thing it's actually if i just quickly go here all you need to do is run it is download the whole repo you have to have node installed on your computer if you run npm install and npm run dev then you'll actually be running the website the full website you don't need to connect to a database authenticate to anything everything that's on the website is in this repo it's a static build website which is very important to me as part of this process to sort of bring the community in um and then you can you can see it locally so if you could you want to play around the website locally yourself you can do that as well okay um this is a nice tip by the way i'm always running into issues and i find that if i run npm run clean right like that also nice fix any issues i'm having okay so then uh let me get you the uh url it's coding train dash preview one thing that's been exciting about this is i've been learning how to deploy a website automatically through netlify um and uh thank you to um some people on twitter who've helped reach who i've been able to reach out to and get some help with getting a netlify um account set up so let me also put this link i'm gonna answer one question in the chat which is does daniel have a twitch i do uh it's coding train choo choo on twitch i couldn't get coding train on twitch codingtrain2 didn't seem right so i had to do coding train choo choo you know if you have a better idea for a twitch name i'm all ears um but uh what i would like oh so the last announcement is there is another coding challenge video being edited together right now on the wave function collapse algorithm at present it is 90 minutes long so it was a about nine hours of live streaming you know a lot of that was wasted time admittedly so maybe only about four hours of actual coding and editing it down it's about 90 minutes so i'm just sort of curious like would you watch a 90 minute i mean you're probably all going to say yes right now if you're the you know however number of people who are um just happen to be here watching or the core audience watching the live stream but anyway that's that'll be coming out uh soon okay um train of rainbow that's a good name all right so i've got to get to the main event here let's have a looksee on youtube itself and i'm going to go i'm i'm now looking at my own stream to go look at this stream and it's waiting to start so waiting to test live direct feature or redirect or or redirect or whatever it is called okay so uh here i am oh i'm so confused uh here i am waiting for the itp nyu stream to begin what is itp ima lores what is their spring show 2022. so first thing i'll do is i'm going to head over to itp.nyu.edu so itp um is a graduate program ima is an undergraduate program and then there is also this wonderful new program that's not so new anymore i am a low residency program which is a oneyear graduate program and then there's also by the way coming up this summer this thing called itp camp um fourweek creative and cooperative playground so you know you can read more about these particular programs if you're somebody this is not meant to be an ad for them whatsoever it's a place where i work i teach classes i have been there for over 20 years and i am currently on sabbatical for this year so i'm not there now um just to fly on the wall on the stream wall and every semester at the end of the semester the students get together and do a show of their work now this is typically been in person i showed my work at the itp show in probably the first time i did that was 2002 so exactly 20 years ago yeah i think that's probably my first show i don't think oh no i had something in the fall in the winter 2021 show anyway you don't care um so uh but with this uh with the pandemic uh the program the department the school was not able to have an inperson show the last one was winter 2019. there was almost one almost one sort of in the last december didn't happen that was very sad um but there's been some wonderful online exhibitions and innovations and uh researchers and students built uh there's a club there that's building this thing called yorb and so many exciting things for me to cover you can go back and find my old streams now uh but it's back and uh and there's going to be oh it looks like it's starting no yeah looks like oh it's starting it's starting okay this is exciting let's see if they reply to okay um so it's back um i have in the past i'm lost already um oh oh so first of all for the actual show apologies go to itp.nyu.edu show so this is where you can find documentation for all of the projects so every project that is in the show as listed here with more information the name of the students working on it et cetera et cetera i'm so curious about this hummingbirds project um it didn't connect but that's okay then maybe there's a video that didn't work either oh look i see a nice picture of it there was a two to three square foot insulation of a flower piece hanging from the ceiling to contextualize the way participants play with the hummingbird toys learn more and i can go so you know maybe i need to be logged in somehow to find that but um so uh so i want to encourage you to check out the website then there is also a live stream now i'm i'm seeing that it's still just on the sort of preview screen so i'm kind of vamping here so um i in the past have done some live streams from the show itself where i awkwardly tried to walk around with the microphone and like a mobile camera and try to get footage and you can find them i'm sure if we do coding train itp uh itp show and uh go to videos um you can see some some older ones right this is the last one actually into winter show 2019. i you know here's one that i did but this was a an online show 2018 winter show winter show 2020. yeah that was also online uh et cetera et cetera so so you can find these older compilations on on on maybe itp's channel or my channel um i'm sorry uh uh okay so i'm getting important text messages on my phone that i that i'm going to look at in a second let's see what's happening now with the stream so youtube you may have heard has a new feature i mean if you've been on twitch it's called a raid and it happens very often i'm always afraid to use it so i'm like oh god am i going to raise somebody that sounds so aggressive so i try as the twitch community to have the coding train be the friendliest kindest most generous raiders and we're just passengers on the train we're just getting off at a stop to visit your land for a bit we'll get back on our train we'll go on our merry way thank you um but youtube has implemented this feature it's called live redirect very catchy name i might add live redirect right and there's other geography lessons going on in the chat over there so i've enabled it for my account i enabled it for the itp account so in theory i believe when i hit the end stream button you should all be sent there automatically and i was kind of waiting for it to get started to see that it was live before i did that because i didn't want you all to go and then be like there's nothing here and then leave um so let's see if i can if there's any updates for me um okay um uh let's see in the future all right let me answer some questions here are waiting in the future will you do some tutorials about typography in p5 like the text deformation with the cursor okay that is a great idea i would very much love to do that not something not not something that i have a tremendous amount of expertise in i do have this is not really typography exactly but i have the ascii video coding challenge that you might enjoy which is a way of building up an image the pixels of an image with uh characters with letter forms i'm trying to think if i've done other things i've done a lot of videos around programming with text algorithms to generate poetry or to connect to different apis really detect but typography i will say that if you're interested in typography and code i would highly recommend you check out chrono text yes ariel malka ariel.chronotechs.org ariel has been doing this kind of work with typography and computational media for as long as i can remember i feel like i was looking at this stuff 20 years ago being like wow this is cool so i would definitely encourage you to check out their work and a lot of it is actually also not just in the english language or with you know roman characters so that's something that may also interest you depending on where you live in the world and if you're you know what character set you use personally and how you might um create work with that so um that's that's one little tip i can give you here let's see uh can you talk about your video on wave function collapse when will you publish the nature of code 2 book so i have made really good progress in the nature of code 2 book my deadline is the end of 2022. if there is not a new version of the nature of code book by the end of 2022 you heard it here first even though i've said this before you're here second or third that's it give up there will be no nature of code too so i'm determined to make it happen i've made good progress i need to make a lot more progress this summer in order to then be able to finish it off next fall that's the goal uh raspberry pi to run processing is extremely laggy sorry i wish i could help you with that maybe come join the coding train discord maybe somebody would help uh better yet probably go to processing the processing forum uh discourse.processing.org or if you just go to processing.org go find your way to the forum ask there don't have a lot of experience with processing but it doesn't surprise me that it would run slow you know try it depends what raspberry pi you're on depend what you're trying to do but you know start small just use 100 by 100 canvas just draw one thing in it see how that does and build up from there please make a discord tutorial so i i really want to make new discord bot tutorials it's on my list um i really want to make new twitter bot tutorials but i'm kind of oops waiting to see how this all shakes out this whole twitter nightmare hmm am i still streaming because this stream looks like it disconnected all right we're waiting for it to begin i'm answering questions uh i vote new google extension series i feel like my browser extension series i'm sure there's a lot more that i can do and there's stuff that's changed but from what i hear it still kind of applies and gives you a good basic introduction so that's lower on my priority list to redo i kind of got myself involved in too many projects so there's not going to be a ton of new content until june at the earliest um guitar simulation that's interesting uh so joppy topi there is ex again i don't wanna i'm not here to just like arbitrarily like plug my stuff but um and i'm sure there are better browser extension tutorials on youtube but you're watching the kodi drain if you want to see my take on it chrome extension coding train i do have a series on it uh it was made in 2017 that it's you know pretty old at this point but from what i understand it has i mean some apis and little things might have changed but the core principles are still um yeah ml5 and teachable machine that's something i would like to revisit more all these are great ideas uh wave function collapse let me see if i can address this briefly before and somebody just ping somebody mentioned in the chat if anybody noticed the spring show actually going live um because i don't i don't see it live right now okay uh now hold on uh also please talk amongst yourself i didn't expect to be on after four i've gotta answer coding challenge of minimal services mathematics of soap film that's an awesome idea i love that idea um yeah all this stuff about pi script i don't know anything about pi script i have to investigate that at some point that's pretty interesting uh hold on i'm just gonna put on some music for you while we're waiting uh okay i just have to reply to this message to do with my kids being picked up from school this is not an ideal time for me to be streaming but at the time the itp show is so i've got to do it now okay so okay um the hundred digits of pi song creative coding and basic oh yeah so um essay uh s period a period who is asking about creative coding and basic so i've had a little bit of a setback and my um i can go to my twitter where you'll see updates about this i have been working on restoring uh my old apple 2 plus computer and i i had an issue with the power supply and i actually purchased a new power supply unit like a modern rebuild of it which worked great but now something seems to be wrong with the actual cpu or logic board or rom or ram or whatever these things are so this is what i'm stuck with right now you can see this is what it looks like i've been getting great advice online i actually just bought off ebay a replacement logic board for the apple ii plus so rather than try to like diagnose and repair like individual chips i think i'm just gonna try swapping out so that's supposed to arrive and i'll try swapping that out and see how far i get um uh yeah and um simon assam and chat mentioned steering behaviors why don't you make any nature of code videos in a while you know i just i'm not good at doing a lot of videos all the time so if i if i had a life where i was making like videos every day i would do a coding challenge one day i would be doing my discord bot the next day i'd do another nature of code video the next day maybe this summer i can get some more momentum going i feel like this has been a pretty decent year 2022 i also have a more elaborate production process for better or worse i have talked about this before but the quality of the videos i think has improved uh i don't i don't it's a tradeoff like maybe in the end having um less editing and less production value but just more and more stuff would be better i don't know the answer to that but that's that's really the the reason um all right let's make a video about quaternions i hope that's part of our inside joke here ah okay look at this okay we're gonna send everybody the show is happening oh okay i'm gonna send you all so get ready everybody this is
