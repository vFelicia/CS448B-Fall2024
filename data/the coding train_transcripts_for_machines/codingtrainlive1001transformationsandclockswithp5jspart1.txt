all the board wah hello and welcome to another Friday afternoon coding train I hope that I am streaming live by freeing that foul it will make me believe that I'm streaming live thanks everyone for tuning in first I just want to say just want to say the last week I had a lot of technical difficulties and I'm really hoping that those technical difficulties will not happen today I just spent about the last 15 minutes why I'm 15 minutes late although 50 minutes late it's not so bad for me to be perfectly honest fiddling with some settings clear enough some hard drive space reconfiguring my streaming settings and right now I am not crashing if it does crash be warned the stream will just stop with no warning and I'll then right into the lack of chat that's going on and this is a great way to start boy and you know what this is even better way to start what is today's apparently I have actually live streamed a hundred times this is the 100 session now there was a point quite a while ago where I had intended to I'm just looking at the chat here I'm looking at the wrong window there was a point where I intended to plan this very elaborate exciting livestream number 100 I also keep meaning to get some new music and sound effects but nonetheless it is still live stream on 100 and we can be happy for that and I did bring something special back for a live stream number 100 I brought the mug back you could get your very own yellow mug at I don't know where Pottery Barn the local farmers mugs ceramic market I don't know where did you find if anybody can find a beautiful yellow mug like this actually it's a slight little chip in the bottom and wouldn't mind getting another one anyway I do actually have coding trade mugs for sale but that's another story so my name is Dan Shipman I appear every Friday with sub exceptions on YouTube I live stream I code stuff I make a lot of mistakes I embarrass myself and then I leave that's basically what happens and you know how I said I code stuff most of the time i procrastinate and then I takes me a long time to get to the coding because I'm afraid but I'm going to summon my courage and all my positive energy and I'm gonna try to get to the coding quickly today so so anyway I did actually I was being silly but I really do would like to do a special kind of like coding train celebration event livestream something at some point I some of you have been following my channel I am fully with aid available to be viewed a set of elbows here I still have a lot of I had a bicycle accident and broke this elbow and I still have a lot of issues with range of motion and weakness and stuff but in terms of coding and speaking to this camera I think I'm in a good good place so I am back there was a point of why I was saying that but that's mostly why I was off for two months trying to kind of have some surgeries and recover and I just so the 100 stream kind of planning got away from me but I'm trying to think there's got to be like a really good number that's like special in some interesting mathematical way like you know 3.14159 or something so maybe for my three thousandth one hundred and forty ninth stream but so some other number that I could do something special for or maybe have some suggestions that sort of thing I'm looking at the chat and that's but I did I I have a couple special things I'm gonna open my I showed this at the end of last week's livestream but very few people can tolerate watching a full two or three hours of be live or in an archive so I am excited last year you might remember when this YouTube channel was called coding Bo I had this wonderful music video trailer for the channel spent a lot of time energy working on with wonderful collaborators well I got the back together again with some different folks and very soon I will be premiering a new coding train theme song and video I'm going to show you a short short four second clip from it right now let me see my little teaser that's a special treat for the live stream some of you are asking in the chat what are you going to do today well besides read random numbers and play lullaby music I intend to do some coding and today's episode is really meant for beginners so one of the things that I do with this channel is I teach out a program here at nothing changed behind me New York University called ITP and I do have some things to plug about some new programs that we're starting here which I'll do in a moment and this semester I teach a course called introduction to computational media last week I talked about a course that I teach about programming with text text analysis and text generation but that is a beginner course for people have never programmed before and this week was the second week of that course and so a bunch of things came up they do not have a video tutorial on transformations meaning the functions in processing in p5 translate rotate push pop scale I use them all the time to Kody challenges and I sometimes sort of explain them but they don't have a standalone video that only explains to those things that's item number one I do not have a video that talks about how to make custom shapes built from your own set of vertices custom polygons vertex curved vertex I think there's this thing called bezzie a and I'd really really I'd say I feel a little like woozy whenever I start to think about Bezier curves and how they actually work but there is also something called busy vertex which maybe I will summon the strength of fortitude to talk about as well so transformations custom shapes a classic computational creative coding assignment is to build a clock this comes from originally from John Maeda who gave this assignment I to his students which whom is notably Golan Levin was it Golan Levin who now teaches at CMU and as a whole webpage about clocks time to show you so I was thinking also doing a clock coding challenge not because I intend to make a creative or beautiful or interesting clock but if I can show you the pieces of making a basic clock then everybody on the internet who feels like it would even could make their own clocks and share them with me and that'd be exciting okay so that's kind of a bit of a plan for today I'm amazed that people from all over the world are watching hello to my anmar that is really wonderful and exciting and thrilling to me in my little room with no windows fluorescent light these cabinets in this room I'm gonna room with no idea what's in them this actually used to be a closet so I said to livestream so this is actually a but there's still some file cabinets of other things in here so I don't know okay um what else do I have to say ah I wanted to talk about something called p5 Manager which is a no npm module Oh a 1000 p.m. but that's what I've been trying to use a little bit because i have this other way of starting a p5 project which involves downloading the like thing from the website and then like renaming it and copy pasting it every time they start a new p5 project which is a completely ridiculous should not be doing that alko reminded me that es6 the green paper is visible Simon is telling at the green paper oh yeah you can see look at this this is actually a probably make it more visible like this this is how you know this is weird but I have this extra laptop this is the secret laptop where it's my script is and all the code I want to type is hilarious right it's correct if anybody wants to write a script for me I would gladly read us and I don't know but but I I'm joking but I have gotten me quite I have gotten too I always see you looking at the side that's I know that's where all your code is in advance and you know what so what the zealot I'm doing if I was at it all tried to appear confident or was competent would you do something like that and plan things and script things but that's not me um but in the chat folks are asking about es6 classes well that is on my list so I wasn't going to do that today because I'm kind of those videos are coming because that is a topic for the course this fall it's around week five of the course of word week next week is week three so it's coming up pretty soon pull this up but you guys might be interested in this ICM 2017 Moses github.com slash ITP NYU ICM 2017 seventeen so this is the syllabus for the course that I teach in person and I'm looking at this oh yeah this is actually where I want to look so this is kind of this is kind of the outline and so we've done the first two weeks and I have videos already I I do intend to kind I do need to like refresh some of those videos like introducing because we're quite old and you know I could be talk about new projects and new things and eventually some new hopefully some new editing tools for p5 will be available soon that I can talk about but week five so I've got to really do the es6 classes stuff honestly I really need to do it next week because by the time we're talking about functions people might start looking ahead and looking at things so so that's kind of the plan kept going don't do poly someone asked in the chat the only other language I sort of kind of speak which is French because you know I wish I knew so many more languages here's a skull oh I've got a script now in the chat oh good here's my script four thousand nine hundred eightyfour nine thousand two hundred seventy three 186 thousand two hundred and nineteen 2057 I actually have another script which I wanted to mention has to be the code you know everybody whenever you see the coding train is coming on in like 330 or three 45 or overtime is your time zone just just allocate like at least a half an hour hour of doing something else and it's pretty good on goodbye that I might be coding JSONP whoo that's it okay so I am if I am looking into and so you guys might be familiar with something called Oh F course Oh F for openFrameworks which is a wonderful C++ library and framework for doing creative coding I I was in touch with Zack Lieberman to come and be a guest in August and we were scheduling it but I had so many complications but I still hope to make that happen of course this is great Oh F course for openFrameworks of course but really what do we want to know this is great like the found poetry of Google searches is really quite wonderful I'm sure it things that I type in there could get quite embarrassing but I like that of course I still love you of course but oh of course let me Google with Shanghai maybe we'll go to some website I think this is it so I am collaborating with Oh F course to print transcribe translate with subtitles some of my videos to release them in China and because YouTube is not available in China easily and so I have a script I did I recorded an introduction to those videos I'm tempted to try to do it have you guys evaluate my Mandarin but now I'm too embarrassed so if anybody's really interested in helping with that I don't know if that there's a need for help with that but our has ideas or thoughts Zac Marie is requesting it was playing at the beginning of my life hi you know so bunny bull was moved I don't have full range of motion I think all this like lame jokes and dancing is getting much worse I think I can do about that sorry everybody okay let me talk about two things that I want to mention which I think are important one is date processing gorg processing Community Day processing Community Day for the first time really this is the first time that we are organizing an event for everyone who works with processing to come together and spend a day to celebrate the community and so there will be workshops and discussions about online communities and all sorts of wonderful things it's for all ages I will be doing but it says there the coding trade live on stage I'm gonna like learn to play the guitar you know I don't know um so School of Rock recently which is like you know I love that show great show salty revin Hanson also fantastic this is by the way coding train the show at the programmer person does musical theater reviews cuz really it's very sad that's not that sad actually but if I could sing and dance for real there would be no coding train or just be my must be I don't know what I read but I'd be tempted to do that ok oh I start my processing day okay so processing day one day I was thinking though like code the musical kind of like musical version of Tron where all the code is like singing and dancing there could be something there right think about it think about it just you know think about it there's a musical theater writing program here to School of the Arts I could quit I could go to the program I could learn to write musicals you could happen I could do it don't don't don't don't test me I might do it okay processing day so I really encourage you guys one thing I want to mention that a couple things if you're interested in coming and you have a lightning talk or a demo or something you'd like to present whether you're a beginner an advanced programmer an artist an engineer a dancer this is for everybody from anywhere to apply and present something and that's well and there's more information here so I encourage you to follow processing or tweet me at shipment a you enjoy the founder of the school for part of computation is the main organizer of this event he's wonderful does amazing stuff so you can also be in touch with him okay alright the other thing I want to mention is that we are I forgot to look at this advanced ITP anyway LED you ima so we are starting here at New York University at Tisch School of the Arts a new BFA which stands for something something for something I don't know I don't know about this academic stuff there's degrees and things like that but it's a fun place I'm looking over here because that's where my screen is where I see myself and I just have this like van anything right just stare at myself but I want to talk to you you the little circle in the middle of this Canon camera so interactive media arts is a new undergraduate program which will start for the very first time next year you can find out a lot more about the program on this website we're having open houses that you could come and actually meet people here and ask questions I'll be around and actually some of these are through like the NYU tour stuff so please check it out and if you're interested in learning more about the new undergraduate ima program there's still the Graduate ITP program but this is new and especially if you're in high school or you know a high school or who's thinking about college and wants to kind of get into this kind of stuff this is something to think about okay so there we go I will include links to all this stuff in the whatever I don't know the video description is that what is that what is that what you do I don't even know anymore all right thank you very much for tuning in to the coding train this was great I had a really nice time and I will see you on I don't know let's do some coding oh okay let me just check first let me see if there's any important questions what is by the way I'm senpai bean I see this a lot is this a Korean phrase and excuse me if I'm totally wrong there I somehow I had a sense that maybe it is I see a lot of people refer to me as senpai Sen Pai and I'm wondering what the hell I guess I could look it up alright oh do you guys hear about the Alka one of a dedicated viewer Alka was reminding me today and let me see if I can like that the cassini there's a great data set that I wanted to look at where is this in our slack Channel what channel is that in oh right flat channel so if you're interested you know only if you really feel so inclined you're welcome to support the work that I'm doing at patreon.com slash coding train if you would like to join me it's a crowdfunding site you can join our little slack community to discuss stuff about the channel and into programming questions and that sort of thing you can get your coding trained tshirts and bugs at coding trades or envy compost those things in in the chat it's a meme so we're so japanese for master teacher okay i apologizes japanese okay I will look into that that's a bowl that it's very nice of you to say if that's indeed where I wanted to find this link I'm looking in the chat here for the the Cassini spaceship dataset okay so I need to go to Saturn JPL nasa.gov galleries galleries raw images alright so let's take a look at this let's also take a look at Twitter / 13 PT I think yes so this oh so this is so this is what I'm talking about there the Cassini Saturn there's a bunch of interesting data sets let's see if there's it's it's a four o'clock now and I'm gonna be here for a couple hours more let's see if there's time later someone can remind me I would love to like look into this data set see we could download it and do anything with it but I would encourage you those of you were interested it's it's pretty it's a special event today and and kind of like I've been just like looking at these tweets and seeing about the history okay so in jonatha quorum science graphics editor the New York Times appearing here as a Twitter avatar on the coding train somebody could snapshot this and tweeted back okay all right all right now me back to my live chat see I just procrastinate oh no alka don't worry I was not requesting anything of you I was just mentioning how you remind me of the Cassini thing all right so let's put let's let's go let's move forward let's start so what I want to do is I'm going to now last week I was having trouble with the atom editor and oh let's let's do a little warmup let's do a little warmup and because I want to make a new p5 project and this by the way I said today was for beginners which it is but this p5 manager thing is a little bit of an aside that's that's for how to like generate a p5 project if you're not using but actually it's good for beginners too let's let's uh if you I'm Mike sometimes I think I'm just so easy to forget that there's like you're broadcasting good people are watching cuz you're just in a room by yourself but you're just talking anything because I also used to record video tutorials a lot without livestreaming them and so these moments what happened just get tired or like my wit spaced out do something else and I would just like to turn it off and start okay doing life you can't do that okay p5 manager NPM really oughta do something about the climate control in here it's very warm email somebody this close the closet with file cabinets you think I've got something like a very fancy studio here I'm in a closet with filing cabinets okay no windows but some lights and some computers right so I would prefer to go to the github page for this great I can dismiss this alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start by doing a quick little video tutorial about p5 manager now I want to make sure one thing that I've always feel really concerned about and never know what to do about is when I do a video about something else that somebody has made I suppose it's a nice thing because I'm featuring it and bringing bringing other people I'm showing it to people and people can use it and contribute to it but I also want to make sure it's very clear that I always properly credit and don't sort of by accident take credit for other people's work so what I want to do is just spend a minute here looking into who created okay so this is chinhae oops camera went off in case you were wondering June how you can anybody help me if Bailey Anderson is asking how much does p5 cost p5 is free it's an opensource JavaScript library no cut no cost whatsoever hide your time and sanity that's just about it okay so someone help me if it shouldn't ha how you June how you how did I do about that pronunciation let me know the camera goes off from time to time because it's like I'm it's like anybody watch the TV show loss it's like it's just a thing I have to press the button every 30 minutes or else something bad will happen in the world okay that's why I does it I could probably if I ever took the time to really try but I'm just used to it now you want to press the button every 30 minutes it makes me feel good makes me feel okay like I know it's going on I'm pressing the button everything's gonna be fine that's why I press the button Jun how you okay okay the funny thing is I'm seeing in the chat how this is a little cringy so it definitely is cringy Fotolia a little cringy I think I'm doing pretty well today to be perfectly honest cuz he leaves a lot Grinchy but I like that that the comment went said it's a little crazy maybe his first live stream today is life super 100 by the way okay let's go so I'm gonna open up terminal and I'm gonna just make sure I have node installed great what's the thing that I do till I clear it option command option command shift option there's a thing we like it like automatically does clear for you I can't remember what it is alright then I need to find your window that's not a finder window then I can quit this Cisco Connect thing I can just loop this over and over again simply hurts slightly in the elbow okay and I should read a hundred what I'll do today is I'll read 100 random numbers towards the end I will read 100 random numbers from the coding train is brought to you by a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates from the RAND Corporation it'll be storybook time later I will read you I will read you from there okay so I have this I have people I'm manager and here we go and I have note all right are the birds creepy I love this is my new favorite sure it was $10 this shirt I feel like I need to have more colorful lively shirts okay hello welcome to a video tutorial about something related to p5 called p5 manager now p5 manager is by chin how you thank you for making this wonderful tool I hope that it's okay that I'm making a video about it I am NOT an expert I did not I can take no credit whatsoever for this wonderful thing called p5 manager but I knew about it and I can use it in class the other day and it really helped me out so I wanted to make a video so other people would learn about it so okay so what is P 5 minute or you guys might be aware that what the things that I do it's a really bad habit sometimes I don't want to make a new sketch I go to p5.js or get some great technique here then I go to download' then I'm like oh which like download oh ok I'm gonna download p5 yes complete and I click on that download something and then I find it you can see look at me this is how ridiculously horrible I am you could see that I have done this is like big 9 times but I've done that the same thing I just download it and then I like open it up and then I find somewhere in here like oh there's like empty example and I rename it or copy it somewhere and that's like my new sketches i'ma do this is not a great workflow p5 manager is a commandline tool that you can execute from the command line what's the command line you know have you since some videos you might it uses it's built on top of something called node and I have another video that I'll link to about what is know but you don't really need to know what node is you do need to install node to use this so you can go to node.js org install node and then you can use this node comes with something called NPM which is stands for node package manager which is a way to manage the packages you want to use with node and but why is this relevant because p5 manager is a node package now node is a serverside programming framework in JavaScript and there's a lot that we could say about things that you could do with it but we're not really doing anything with node whatsoever we're just lucky to bask in the glory and somebody else bothered to make something with node called p5 manager so if I've installed node the next thing I can do is go here and I can run this command so what I want to say is NPM node package manager install I wouldn't install something G G is in a kind of an important detail but not so important for us right now it means I want to install this globally meaning it's not part of an individual project it's this thing that I just want to use always on my computer from now on p5 manager is my thing now so I can take this and I can say copy it and I can then go to here and I'm gonna just paste it in I could have just typed it might give me an error it might give me an error this might happened to you we're in a hope this error doesn't happen but it might happen in fact it'd be good if it happens because if it happens then you'll see it happen and you're know how to fix it oh yeah let me got the air alright so what is the air now the air is permission denied and this is actually has to do with the fact that we we want to install it globally the if we just all go believe means it has to go in the like depths of your computer where only the administrator whoever that is maybe you can like you've got to like get into the guts of the system files and all sorts of fancy places that you have to have permission for so there's a way to get permission to do that and the way to do that with terminal is by saying a sudo which stands for Super User do Super User do NPM G no no I don't know I know I'm at the order this really matters install G was soon back out p5 manager and now oh it asks for my password and good thing I think I know think I know the password rainbow unicorn something like that okay nope nope oh my god really the thing is that you oh this is bad this is very bad I don't know what to do anymore we're gonna miss places poor Matt he was gonna edit this it's gonna here's the thing my keyboard doesn't really work so I never know whether I forgot the password or just didn't like type in the right letters because like the e there's an e in my password this password it's not actually my password its password for this computer the e key only works about 50 percent so what is yeah I just okay yeah let's just pretend I mean it's good to have the like goofy weird I make the mistake stuff but maybe we should just edit this later when I actually posted as a separate video just pretend that addressing this for the first time oh whoa no I'd already shoot how do I get back to it ask you for my password let's quit terminal me if I start a new session oh now that windows gonna be a different size and in a different place it's not gonna match where's my continuity manager oh my god alright ah this is fine we're gonna there's gonna be an edit point where I'm gonna come back and say I figured out what my password it is I'm doing it again wait what is good it's only getting warmer and warmer in here as the sweat drips from down from the side of my face sorry about that hopefully you're watching this and I'm now just reappeared and I figured out the password and entered it so I'm gonna run the sudo command for he would Ken with the correct password so you could watch okay hey that seemed to have worked so now I have installed forevermore the p5 manager with note so there are a bunch of things you can do with the p5 manager and I encourage you maybe I'll come back to these if it's interesting hard but I want to show you like these kind of like the simplest way ever use it so the p5 manager will actually allow you to create the collection of sketches and you can you can serve them up and run us and like makes it like to like web page with a like a table of contents of all the things you've made but and you should you could follow these instructions for that but I'm actually going to scroll down and what I want to do is just generate a standalone project so I for me in making examples and I put them in all different places it's less about a collection right now and then individual like standalone projects so I want to do this anytime I write now that I've installed that package I can just write p5 anytime in my terminal window now and it's gonna say look hey you've installed the p5 manager zero point three point two so but whenever I want to run up a specific p5 command like p5 generate that's going to generate a project and then I have to give it some specific parameters arguments of what kind of project I want to generate so what I want to do is I want to generate a bundle with a particular name and for short you can also just type p5 G B but I'm going to be longwinded about it for the purpose of this video tutorial bundle and the coding train will be the name of my project and I'm going to hit enter it created a whole bunch of stuff I am now going I don't know where I was I'm gonna I'm gonna open it up and Here I am so one thing by this is a boots there is a boot in this room why is there a boot in this room so I want to kind of go back fake some stuff so hold on p5 we're gonna make this look exactly like what it was before oh it already exists oh sure okay hold on we're gonna CD I forgot to like go somewhere like into the documents which I should have done at the beginning how am I gonna fix this how am I gonna fix this I guess I could just I guess I could just talk to it I'm gonna get through the coding is for its funny this is taking way too much time okay it's fine I'm gonna live with what I did I just I didn't want to put it just in you know so I'm gonna the root directory of the computer but let me just get back to where I was and then I'll keep going except I can never get back to where I was and we erase it coding training Oh I mean documents now Oh Mac computers are so ridiculous sometimes okay so now that that's worked I realized I kind of did something pretty terrible which is when you first open at least on the Mac your terminal window it just plops you right into the root directory of your computer and that's probably not where I want to put my coding train project so you know this is a bit of an aside but I can you can change directories I could say like seedy documents because really what I want to do is be in the Documents folder perhaps and then I can kind of go to the Documents folder and I can say make a folder and I can call it p5 projects and then I can oops and I can make a folder and I can make a folder called something like p5 projects which already exists there and I could say CVP 5 projects and then now what I want to do is go back and run this one more time to get it right I'm gonna run that one more time you can see it created those projects I can go back to the finder I can go into p5 projects and I can see look at what I've got I have now have a folder called coding train which really is just one project it's got the HTML file it's got the sketch J's file it's got that whoops which I just opened up by accident and it's got the the libraries folder with the p5 libraries so this is the way to create an individual single p5 project I can do this all the time now I'm gonna do it in one of my future videos I can edit and work on it that way and it will always get the most current version to the p5 library and I encourage you to explore also the collection the collection functionality of this as well which you can make a nice little like what page it does it's automatically with all your project okay so thank you for watching video cut the p5 manager hopefully it's useful to you I will see you in a future video more you might see me using the p5 manager thank you very much all right all right everybody sorry about that that can get edited into something I think all right so now what we're gonna do we're gonna start doing some actual coding here now what I want to see is like Adam I like to use the Adam editor it's what I'm kind of used to I have a bunch of configuration settings set up let's go and get let's let's actually get that project folder I just made with the p5 manager which was in p5 projects coding train I'm gonna put that onto the desktop that's where I like to keep everything no I'm gonna rename it to transformations and I'm gonna put it on the desktop and then I'm going to open this with the atom editor looking down at the screen instead of at you hello and I'm gonna open up the sketch I am going to I'm going to get myself to the desktop wants to update something and then I'm going to run a server oh this Mac is not plugged in can you guys see that we've got a problem here I need a power need some power okay that should hopefully do the trick all right there we go that should hopefully fix the problem here at 4% hopefully this is gonna go okay so that's there now then I just need to get back into the browser go to localhost open up the console let's add just to make sure things are work oh yeah why what do you guys think this is about this happened to me last week my atom completely flips out on this computer I just was thought like God happened last week let's take a ride it's only if I log in in this account that I use you're right that this is quite visible more so than usual do you have an idea of how to fix that you're gonna have to bear with me here for a second that's better just change the threshold okay okay I don't know if you can see that all right okay now I guess I will I will go back to using I just spend so much time let's try updating some stuff we try updating Adam beautify and oh and you know what I don't obviously do and let me try oh no I don't you know what I'm realizing also is I don't have the things tend to work much better here if I'm actually not connected to the wireless internet but rather the the actual wired internet so I'm connecting to that now I'm gonna turn off the WiFi yeah I can just use Visual Studio I don't know why I'm stuck on this I advise you to reinstall Adam all right let's do that let's try that I just didn't want to do that and lose all my settings and everything but let's try let's quit Adam we're waiting for Adam to install to download vim I wish I aspire to be a VIN user oh look at this I mean the threshold let's split the difference here Euler telling me that atoms beautify was probably the issue and I should have waited I kind of do some tutorials about making electron apps at some point what's going on everyone s getting questions yes I want to open it this computer is like dying did I lose all my settings you got lost on my settings right now no I didn't okay great I think we're back all right primary people protective about the setting okay stop the music please your wish is my command alright yeah so by the way people are asking like my computer is at 4% and I plug the plug back in and now it's at like 40% now it's at like 33% the battery of my computer is completely does not work so I'm surprised that it didn't actually just like shut off automatically I need that new laptop okay we are now going to make use of the whiteboard we'll definitely need to make use of the whiteboard for so I guess one thing I'm curious about is how is this picture seem okay brightness level can you see me can you hear me fine in this shot and what's the focus okay stop drawing the little thing how does the focus look I'm gonna walk over here looks like that looks okay you can see that read that okay good okay let's check this eraser okay and oh right there's this great explanation I need to you need focus not the cam I don't know what that means so actually Simon in the chat loyal viewer makes a good point which is that I need graph paper which isn't exactly what I need now I have seen a demonstration of explaining rotation done that makes use of paper I'm gonna put over here and a pen or pencil so I'm gonna attempt to do that but I'm not gonna do it right now so I'm gonna leave this here and I'm gonna go to the p5.js reference page and I'm gonna look at where is the where are the transformations that's a good translate transform okay and that off okay I don't love the only functions that I want to talk about a rotate oh boy translate and scale and push and pop aren't even on this list so I'm not gonna this is not a great reference for me right now because they're part of structure which makes sense so I'm actually not gonna it's fine to have the reference here but let's just keep the whole page here alright here we go everybody 50 minutes hit hey you know Phoenix makes a good point that it is 50 minutes in and I haven't really done any coding yet but at least you know I talked about p5 manager with something it's better than nothing all right let's begin hello everybody in this video tutorial I'm starting here by this whiteboard my friend the whiteboard ID to get my district people of the room XD ok it's fine it's fine hopefully no one's gonna come to complain I want to talk about transformations so this is actually a video tutorial that I've been missing for a long time it fits right into the first or second week of programming really because it really it can become a very sophisticated complex topic as we move into 3d graphics and all sorts of stuff but ultimately this is a way of controlling your views so to speak of the canvas you're drawing to the orientation the scale the rotation to alter the way that you draw things so that's a terrible way to explain it so let me make a list first this is gonna help the functions that I want to explore in this video are translate rotate there's another one scale and then also push and pop now there are more functions related to transformations than just these three and they push these five really but these are the ones I don't want to focus on in this video and I want to talk about what's the goal what is the goal here so there's a lot of reasons why you might want to use transformations and I'll try to talk about those grouping shapes together can be useful nesting various shapes within each other is a way that it could be useful but ultimately for you who are if you're just starting working with code and p5 and graphics the main reason you want to use transformations it's really just for this rotate function because you have a canvas you might have a rectangle here and what you want is for that rectangle to spin around and rotate like rotate to spin around and you would think that's like the simplest thing because there's a rotate function in turn I just say rotate another thing rotates and we're done we can leave it's not and it ultimately it's it's it's um it's not so hard but a little tricky at first and a little confusing what these things do so the goal that I want to have in this video and there's more to it than this but at least for this first video about transformations is I want to have two rectangles and I want them each to rotate maybe this one rotates around its center now maybe this one rotates around its corner and they both rotate in opposite directions independently of each other and then you might think to yourself also like an exercise you can do and maybe I'll I think I did this actually in some solar system simulation video that from remembering that right now is you could think about well what if you have some type of solar system like simulation where you have some type of star or Sun in the middle a planet that rotates around that and while that planet rotates around that there's another one you know kind of rotating around that so think about these sort of nested systems and I'm sure you'll come up with all sorts of other creative ideas so where to begin I first want to begin with the translate function so I'm going to come over here and I'm gonna go to some code which has very little in it and I'm gonna just do I'm gonna write a draw function ultimately I'm gonna start with something static but ultimately I might have an animator so so I'm gonna draw a rectangle and I'm gonna draw that rectangle at you know 50 comma 50 and I'm going to be 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high and I'm gonna say fill 255 and I'm gonna go back to the browser and I'm gonna look at this rectangle so I see this rectangle there there it is so what have I done I have drawn let's come back to this here Matt maybe you can edit out that erasing there and just have a little jump cut could we just because I forgot how like to Harbor racing is for me right now so I do with my left hand and so like can't really do it quickly like I usually late in the video okay I'm gonna draw the canvas again and what I've done right I have this rectangle and I gave it an XY position and it's oriented according to its corner its position is 50 comma 50 50 pixels alone on the xaxis 50 pixels on the yaxis and it's we see it here because it's 50 comma 50 relative to 00 which is in the top left so we're saying rectangle 50 comma 50 you know 100 comma 50 now I could do exactly the same code exactly the same code in a slightly different way I could say instead translate 50 comma 50 and then I could say rectangle zero comma zero 100 comma 50 and what I've done is I this is these two pieces of code are identical because what does translate do it moves the point of origin it moves 0 0 and says 0 0 now lives here so if I draw the rectangle at 0 0 I see it in exactly the same place but I'm just thinking about the orientation of the canvas in a different way and the reason why you might do this is to say oh translate this 0 0 to the center because you just feel you like to like think about your screen and it's like 0 0 being in the center there's all sorts of reasons why you might do this let's prove that this is the case though I'm back here so I'm now going to say right here translate 50/50 rectangle 0 0 100 comma 50 and I'm gonna say fill well actually what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just comment this out and I'm gonna hit refresh we should see exactly the same code the second the same result exactly the same result timeout for a second yeah sorry I saw something in the chat order Ford of transformations matter yeah all this stuff is going to be relevant okay I feel like I might be taking too long to get to the important parts here but here we go so this is exactly the same why why would I do it one way for the other why would I write it this way Arai why would I write it this way and to be honest there's no real answer to that question it's sort of personal style personal preference but there are scenarios where translating the origin as you and we started for X again I'm having this problem again mostly because I feel like this marker is no good and I and I can't tolerate it Australia for market so why would you do one or the other why would you say translate 5050 and then draw the rectangle at zero zero versus just drawing the rectangle directly at 5050 well one of the things that's important here is that these translations accumulate so just like when you say fill a certain color every shape afterwards is colored according that fill unless you say fill again with a different color the same sort of thing applies to translate so now if I were to say rectangle you know 100 150 comma 10 you can see there's that other rectangle it's drawn relative to where that origin was so now what's interesting about this is I can actually instead of saying translate 50 50 I could take translate Mouse X Mouse so now these move relative to that one position so this is one reason why this can be useful because you might want to think about this complex pattern that's all centered around or relative to one given point and you could move it all together just by altering the translation so this is one reason why it's useful oops wrong keyboard another reason why it's reusable is really the main purpose for this video rotate you cannot control the rotation of a shape you're drawing without the use of translate and why is that well rotation is not as simple as just saying rotate something so let me grab this eraser here if if you said to me you know rotate that eraser at 90 degrees I would say well okay I rotate it at 90 degrees but we have this like bond you and me we can speak the language of angles and rotation without specifying but the computer does not have this bond with you it needs to know okay in addition to rotating just rotating by some angle I need to know like around what point should I rotate what's the origin what's the axis of rotation and so and what axis there's all sorts of questions so so this is what this is how this is why translate is so important because always always always rotation happens around the point of origin so if I translate to the and draw a rectangle at the corner it will 0 0 will rotate around its corner so and I have another way of describing this that I'm going to come back to in a second so let me explain what I mean by this let's come back let's put this rectangle at 5050 let's get rid of translate and I'm gonna say okay and here's the other thing hello angles time for a little review I think I have this a video for sure but since we're here let's talk about angles for a second so I have some room over here so if you're me you probably typically think of angles in terms of degrees this is like a 90degree angle and this is a 45degree angle and you know a full rotation is 360 and we can actually use the unit of measurement degrees in p5 and I'm going to because there's a function where I can say angle mode and then I can say degrees to tell p5 I like to think in terms of degrees and you should think in terms of degrees also but natively and if you use other programming and graphics environments you might not be able to do this the native kind of unit of measurement for both computer graphics systems is something called I need more space maybe the problem was this eraser is bad and that's why grey wizard and the chat I think that the name rank was mentioning to me that I did I get a new eraser which apparently not so my erasing it's going to get edited out when these get published in standalone videos just ok a unit of measurement known as radians radians refers to arc length oh my goodness what's that well maybe I'll make a video about arcs someday but let's just think about a circle and pretend a circle is a unit circle what is a unit circle it means the radius is of length 1 1 pixel 1 centimeter 1 meter whatever it is let's say I want to know what is this angle right here in radians well it turns out that if I take this arc flatten it out and measure it that length is that angle in radians so radius is a way of describing and and and if you remember from some math class or you haven't taken this math class yet the circumference of a circle meaning the whole length of the entire outline of a circle the formula for calculating that is 2 pi R so if R is 1 it's just 2 pi and guess what what is 360 degrees in radians it's 2 pi so I kind of got a little off track the point of what I'm talking about which is translating rotate but if I want to rotate something according to an angle I need to at least decide what unit of measurement I'm using by default we'll use radians let's make things a little simpler and let's switch it to degrees so I'm back over here now and I'm going to say right under create canvas angle mode angel mode let's let's activate angel mode degrees and now before this rectangle I am going to say rotate 45 oh so that's good so let's let's add a variable have you tried variables yeah I don't know where this video fits into the playlist but variables and incidentally I'm gonna use this word let to create a variable which sometimes a future go is be silly that I'm saying it because all my videos will have left but this is kind of new say let a for all that angle equals 0 and I'm gonna put angle in here and then every time through draw I'm going to say angle equals angle plus 1 so I'm gonna increase by 1 degrees what's going on here look at that oh it's gonna come back in a second can we wait do you mind waiting oh look there it is ok so what's it doing ah okay so what it's doing is this rectangle is at fifty fifty is rotating around the origin 0 0 by default if you just say rotate everything's gonna rotate around the origin so that's why we're seeing this happen you know it goes to here and then it goes to here and then it goes to here this is not a bad thing that might be what you want in fact maybe you want it to kind of like rotate around the center of the window so I could come back over here and I could say let's move the origin let me move the origin to 200 200 and now I have this rectangle that's rotating kind of around the center it's a little confusing I think it might help if I drew a line we could see what's going on here if I drew a line from 0 0 to fit t50 well what what happened there so why didn't the line ah look what I did so this is really important and I make me keep this a little more complicated than I mean to but this is Sookie look at this I translated drew the line and then I rotate it and drew the rectangle so only the rectangle is rotating not the line the order of operations is so so important so let me put rotate up here then let me draw both a line and a rectangle after I translate to the center and rotate by that angle so I hit save I don't think so so now we can really see what's going on you can see here how it's rotating the or the point of origin the point of reference for that rotation is the center of the window wherever I've defined zero zero to be by translation and then this is there now why does this work this way I'm going to tell something and I'm pretty sure it was gold on Levin who I saw do a demonstration of this but I have a piece of paper this piece of paper I wanted to now be indicating I want it to be the canvas I'm gonna put it up here okay so what's actually happening let's say that I translate it to the center here right and now I'm going to say rotate 45 degrees I'm gonna rotate this 45 degrees now what am I gonna do I want to draw a rectangle so I'm gonna draw it right down you even see this I draw a rectangle there we go look what I got can you see that so what's actually happening like in the computer's mind is this like turns the thing it transforms the view in essence of the actual Windows canvas itself that draws it as if it hadn't moved it at all but then what you actually see of course is not like the canvas doesn't move just your the view of it moves so what you're actually seeing is the rotated thing try this on your own somebody make a video that's much better than that Oh spike this is why I'll never do live physics demonstrations raising that because terrible about it okay nobody could see the drawing well like maybe we'll edit it I'll take a picture of it I'll edit it back in you can see it right now um yeah that was weird that I put it over here too right that's so strange okay anyway so you see what's going on here so what do I want to do what if I now want this rectangle to rotate around its center how am I going to handle that okay so let's go back to the code and I'm going to say okay well let's forget about this line for a second and let's put this rectangle back here let me run it again oh but where that's weird what's oh it's still doing what it did before what I want is to draw the rectangle at 00 if I draw the rectangle at the point of origin you can't then it will rotate around that kick myself like a weird fingernails on a chalkboard feeling there save refresh so you could see now it's rotating around that rectangles point of reference because that is zero zero and that's where the rectangle is if I wanted to rotate around its center let me say let me say look easy thing I can do is just say rect mode Center so I can tell the rectangle to reference its center and now I have a rectangle rotating around its center that's what I wanted and let me position it a little bit up in the corner more of the screen we could see it spinning over there let me have it go rotate by five degrees every frame and we can see there we go we have this rotating rectangle and it's sort of important to realize that if I was going to have something move around like if I was gonna have this thing move around I would probably then I would I'd have like an exposition and I might have a Y position and now what I would want to do is position the rectangles position is defined by translate x and y so now you can see this it's the same sketch as before but now if X changes so in addition to the angle changing if I were to say x equals x plus 2 or something now it's rotating and move so this is kind of interesting by the way and I have some future videos somewhere from the nature of code playlist that deal with like angular velocity if you're like throwing something and having it spin that's something you could sort of think about simulating but let me back up for a second I'm gonna get rid of the whole X&Y concept that's useful for you to think about and I I'm going to now make the graph the question what happens if I put a rectangle over here and I want it to rotate at a different speed in the opposite direction so let's give these some colors so we can distinguish them let's make this some reddish somethingorother and then I'm going to add another rectangle I'm gonna just put rect mode and set up just sort of as like kind of like a global setting for the program then I'm going to draw another rectangle and I'm gonna give it a different color and where do I want it to be I want it to be kind of at like this is 400 by 400 so let me put it at 300 300 so I'm gonna put it at 300 300 oh where you go yeah so what's going on so one of the things you have to remember is that this translate and rotate affects everything after it so here's a way I could fix that I could just let me just take that translate and rotate and put it afterwards I just put an afterwards just put it after so I just went after it don't worry about it now I've got that rotating with this not rotating because I drew the blue rectangle first then I translated rotate it and got the other thing and this doesn't affect because every time through draw every time through draw transformations reset back to nothing back to zero zero being the top left with no rotation but this is not really a viable solution because I mean I'd like you to draw it in a different order and I might want this thing to rotate so if I were to like translate rotate this is going to affect the other thing so how do I deal with this now don't get me wrong sometimes once again we want this right remember what if I just wanted a little tiny rectangle offset by a little bit rotating around so you can I might actually want this to be the project I want things to be relative and then this is good that they follow each other but in the case of me wanting it to be in the corner separate how do i how do I stop it so one thing you might think to yourself is ah undo well let's see if I translate into 50/50 then I wrote Tintin I drew the thing I know I know I can rotate back by negative the angle okay that undoes the rotation and then I can rotate back by negative fifty negative 50 so I'm gonna undo I'm gonna go backwards and like um reassemble we put this canvas back in the right spot let me hit save and we hit refresh look that worked so that works but this also this is a really not a viable solution because someday I'm gonna create a program with so many transformations for so many different things and want some things to be related some things some things to be independent this mean having to keep track of it myself and undo everything is kind of a nightmare there is actually a function called reset matrix which will actually and why are we calling it Matrix will reset everything but really the function that I'm looking for the one that I haven't bothered to mention yet are these push and pop so you can think about push another word for push in this case being safe and pop another word for pop being restore so I can save the current transformation state where is the origin what's the rotation by the way there's also scale so I haven't mentioned or showing you scale but that's another transformation I can save the state and then I can do a whole bunch of stuff and then I can restore it so kind of like in an undo kind of way so let's look at how that works so I can say right here before I do my first translation let me say save save whatever things were before I do this now I could do some stuff that I could undo it by saying pop so this ultimately has the same effect as it back backing out of what I did before so you can kind of this is a way putting push at the top and pop at the bottom around some code is the way of thinking that code selfcontained in its own transformation world and now if i refresh we can see there we go it's this this rectangle is completely independent of that rectangle and now I could do something like instead of instead of drawing the rectangle at 300 300 I could translate to 300 300 I could draw the rectangle at 00 and I could say something like a rotate by a negative angle times 3 so I'm just going to reuse the same variable but have it be faster or something and we can see this so we can see now I have my one rectangle rotating this way independently of this one rotating the other way so I have a feeling that I've missed a whole bunch of things I've missed talking about scale I miss like that why it's push and pop one of those terms mean so I think I'm gonna pause here for a second timeout and oh yeah me I am so me as making a good point to the chat that there's a width thing and I'm just wondering if I've missed anything okay no I'm just looking at the chat okay I'm going to I'm gonna so cuz I think I should have paused but so I'm gonna come back and in the next video if you're interested I'm gonna do a cup one thing I'm going to talk a little bit about what's actually going on a bit more behind the scenes why is it called push and pop what is this function reset matrix do why is there a matrix I'm gonna talk about that a little bit I also need to show you scale a little bit more which I think could be useful okay thanks for watching and stay tuned for another video I guess okay well Sam I get it okay bye okay all right everyone I forgot to get my spill my water so okay well how did we do apply matrix K week Mon is asking about apply matrix yeah I never really used these functions but I will I will mention it I was trying to do this with avoiding my whole plan was to do this video avoiding talking about matrices because that's an interesting piece of this of course but to just when you're first learning and figuring this out you don't really need to do any the matrix stuff yourself but someone in the chat is asking what do you think about learning Java is my first language you know don't be like me I loved mostly because I I really the first programming environment that I started to use deeply with process processing and processing is built on top of Java ok p5 is a library yes alright so let me think here I'm gonna have to take a break to fill up my water delivery device in a second how are we on time 502 that's not so bad so what I'm gonna do is let's so let me erase this as much as I want to keep it and then the camera went off of course all right so the camera went off where is my I used to have this whole thing of paper towels because I could use this water thing to like erase this but I'm just gonna aggressively use my left arm this should've practiced like explaining this in class or something had this erasers terrible and then this will gone more smoothly this is fine that's what you were saying a new eraser I must have had this before and it looks like it's a bad eraser but I do have a hold on stay with me everybody I'm actually not gonna it's gonna be a hot mic moment I'm gonna go out play this music paper towel and I'm going to erase the hallway all right you know interestingly enough I realized that when I switch to the whiteboard to music all right all right now this should do the trick there we go look at that beautiful erasing glorious I can't want to think I can't do yet is push so I have like no strength up here so I can't push I can do with my left with that that will come back all right so maybe what I should do actually is first talk about scale because there's some crazy stuff there's some crazy stuff you can do with scale there's some kind of crazy stuff you can do a scale the thing that I would like to do is create a world that you can zoom in and out of with scale but it's like two DS oom so all right so let me try to do that I need to get someone at some point but so I don't know that I really need to erase that but okay so let me what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make just I'm gonna make separate boy I really should've I did this like a long time ago let me look for this so a long time let me see if I can find this this is gonna be a really random google search but it didn't work so there uh spell Hanukkah wrong you might be wondering why am i googling Hanukkah Schiffman blog zoom to the scale I don't yeah there we go look at this I found it zoom and pan into D so a long long time ago this was 2011 I made up this example let's see if I can download it it still exists it still seems to exist this is gonna be processing code this is from six years ago now this comes up all the time how to do this so I want to take a look at it this could be actually a coding challenge to be perfectly honest rather than a tutorial video yes so the idea here is that this I can like kind of move this thing around boy this is like the worst demo ever kind of like a tile map sort of thing that you can zoom in and pan around so that's kind of something interesting to think about and that example I'll put a link to that okay all right let me that was a bit of an aside so do I want to do scale so hold on Desktop transformations oh yeah now what I need to do I messed up here is go back to terminal Oh actually I don't need to do anything there and I need to close this and there we go so let's so host our apologies I'm just kind of putting this back into some sort of state that we can use oops so that's the example I just made and now here is the next whoa what did I do here oh I forgot angle mode degrees and somewhere I lost rectum mode Center okay and let me make this okay so what I want to do now is look at scale so I want to look at the scale function okay so simple why I I didn't do a good job of thinking through how to make this multiple parts but let's find short videos are good hey hello okay so this is kind of like a little bit of a part two tutorial about transformations and what I want to do is show you what the scale function does and I don't know that this merits its own video but I didn't fit in it to last one so that's why I'm doing it so what does the scale function do so first of all we see I know there's some other important details that would fill in about pushing top perhaps in this video so we established that translate moves the point of origin if you translate to some point you're translating where the origin is and you're drawing everything relative to that new location rotate rotates the view of the canvas so that as you draw things it appears as if the shapes are rotating itself so so if we were to rotate by an angle and then draw something at zero zero relative to its corner we might see a rectangle something like this rotated by some angle scale stretches everything out or shrinks everything relative also to zero zero and there's some really goofy stuff you can do a scale so scale can actually take one argument or scale can take two arguments so I could scale the same amount along the X and the y axis or I could scale I could stretch something along the x axis and shrink something along the y axis plus I can also put negative numbers in here and what negative numbers do is they not so so what is the number what is it if I put one everywhere this just means 100% the default scale that's just what it is if I were to put two in here suddenly the rectangle will be twice to size I've scaled it by 200% point five I've shrunk it 50% if so I could do it if things are the different axes the xaxis the yaxis but I can also like flip the axis so if I were to flip the axis that means this rectangle would now appear over here we should draw in the other direction so I can actually use scale to say Y doesn't point down but Y points up which sometimes you want to do if you want to you know create some type of simulation where you're thinking about the coordinate system differently so let's go take a look at this now in action so if I have this sketch here where now all I'm doing is them have a simple transformation where I'm translating to the center and I'm rotating the view so that this rectangle rotates around on its own I can do things like say scale for let's just say scale for and now I have this much larger wreck down oh this is something very important something very important about this look at this what's the difference between saints scale for and just saying draw the rectangle instead of 100 comma 50 let's multiply that by 4 400 comma 200 so let's actually I'm going to comment out now scale 4 and I'm going to say rectangle 0 0 400 comma 200 the math is kind of the same here I'm not drawing it 4 times the width 4 times the height now I'm going to refresh and watch closely what is the what's different just going to look the same as look different think about it think about it think about it well it's the same size but look at the outline now the outline is only one pixel wide because the stroke weight is 1 so scale is not just making things bigger in the sense that shapes now have a larger width and height but it's actually zooming in on that twodimensional shape giving your view of the window scaled up so even the width of the stroke gets bigger and so if I go back to here we can do things like you know I could scale according to you know Mouse X divided by 100 so if I do that we can see it's kind of like a 3d effect it's creating a 3d effect in 2d but similarly to how you might work with something like a map API where zooming in and out of a map for more detail or less detail and this is something I would like to do in a future coding challenge which is to create a kind of 2d zoom and pan of a scene and you could do that now of everything I'm giving you because if I just add translate to this right if I'm able to like move the mouse around to translate then I also have pan essentially you know how do I click and drag and is there an offset and that they the interactivity there's a little tricky but it's certainly possible so that's the main thing to say about scale let's look at let's look at what it what it means to do this with different values so I could say scale for in the xdirection and 0.5 in the ydirection as you can see this weirdness I've like stretched it out along the X but shrug it's very weird to look at this let's let's actually say mouse X divided by 100 mouse Y divided by 100 so let's see what that looks like so you can see here and it's a little container also just to make this a little bit more clear so you can see this is me now kind of stretching it and scaling it in in other directions now one thing I want to do here hold hold on is I'm gonna say I'm gonna just put scale 1 comma 1 and I'm going to take out rect mode Center so look the rectangle is now drawn route with the corner at 0 0 off to the right what if I were to say scale negative 1 scale negative 1 so just negative in the X direction now the everything goes the other way so this is quite interesting and I could back up for a second and put the rotation back and actually say let's leave let's put the scale is so now I have this notice how it's rotating clockwise clockwise if I say scale 1 and then negative 1 here oh whoa it's still rotating clockwise of course it's still rotating clockwise freaking myself out here how many make it rotate the other way timeout we have to think about this if still rotating clockwise alone let's go back to this let's take the rotation out so it flips it up the way it's drawn but rotation still goes that way is there a way to use scale to change the rotation I know I could change angle equals angle minus two yes yes I'm aware of that fact I was just thinking to scale actually alter the direction of rotation I don't think I guess it doesn't just alters the direction that you're drawing stuff but it would rotate the other way weirdly I guess maybe it does if maybe if you're in 3d in your eyes explicitly saying like rotate Z or something or rotate Y does not affect the rotation and people are gonna rotate after this oh oh where is well hold on wait a sec yeah oh of course of course this has to come afterwards there we go I expected it to do that and yet it didn't thank you everybody in the chat this is why programming graphics is hard okay so I don't know where to like come back to I'm gonna come back to where it didn't change the rotation I'm gonna come back to here I took a little break there to figure this out because I kind of like my mind stopped working I thought when I can't let let me let me step you through this so I'm going to turn the rotation off and let me put scale back to 1 comma 1 so this is the rectangle drawn pointing down Y points down if I were to change the Y scale to negative 1 now Y points up so that rectangle is drawn up in the upwards direction and then I added rotate back in and shouldn't if Y now points up shouldn't it also rotate backwards well it's not rotating backwards it's still rotating the same way but once again I forgot about order of operations rotate happens before scale so I rotate the view and then I flip the Y so it's drawing the other direction but it's rotating still before I scale so this is now before rotate look what happens now now let's rotate now of course I could if I just wanted to rotate the other way I could just rotate by a negative angle I don't need to use scale for that the speed of rotation the animal rotation that could all be controlled through math that wasn't the point but this actually comes up because a great scenario for this is what if you want to take an image and mirror it so you want to draw the image mirrored well you might think I'll rewrite all the pixels in the opposite direction you can actually use scale to flip the image and draw it in the reverse direction and this can be something that you could try if you're working with edge isn't that sort of thing all right so that's what I want to say about scale if you're looking for a challenge to do try to make a scene that you can sign it zoom it almost as if like a map that you can zoom and pan around in a 2d way using scale push/pop translate rotate if you do that share it with me I would love to check it out and hopefully I'll interest I'll come back and do that in a coding Jon's video I'm gonna do one more video just in case I forgot anything I want to talk a little bit about why it's called push and pop and why there are some other functions that have this like matrix word in it you should probably just skip that video watch I haven't made it yet I mean maybe when you're watching this it'll be there or won't be there he'll come out but I'm gonna try so who knows maybe it'll be fine see you thank you goodbye alright okay so hopefully that helped people there's a nice chat going on here in the patron group in slack where's my paper towel so let me let me erase again you can't see me now so of course what happens to me is I think this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do this that I'm gonna do transformations then I'm gonna do custom shapes then I'm gonna do a coding challenge and you know everything takes so much longer which is probably my fault I think I I don't I like the videos not to be left arm so what I'm gonna talk about in this next video in very and I want to see something because been processing I used to know how to do this you could say print matrix no print matrix not implemented how do I get access to it so pick matrix is a function used to use in processing to show people the underlying data let's go back to reference transform apply matrix reset matrix so there's no but there's got to be the matrix has to be there in a data in a in a variable somewhere what would it be like let me see if I can look this up so let's let's let's have a little digression here if somebody knows how I can easily show the matrix oh I'm in the white board sorry everybody you guys couldn't see what I'm doing there's a new used to be a phone there is a function in processing called print matrix which I Lee have used just for educational purposes to show like when you call rotate like the numbers change you you
