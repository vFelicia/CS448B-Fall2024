Okay, so let's ask the question Why should you learn to program the computer? and really, but, you know, we would first have to admit that the answer to that question might be. "Hello, no, I don't need to do this I'm interested in lots of stuff and this does not interest me", and that's pretty reasonable, I mean first of all you should make sure you go outside, run around, physical exercise is very important, food is delicious, talking to people is wonderful I don't know, hobbies, I like playing cards, I like musical theatre, I don't necessarily need programming for those things so you, you can go and have a very full life and just stop these videos and really be a happy person. At the same time, let's just make, let's just, let's just admit something you probably use the computer a lot. you probably, it's probably a tool for work, family, social, you use it, right, and how do you use it, let's say you've never written a line of code before in your life. You probably do things like you use Chrome, or you use Photoshop, or you use Word, we could keep making a long list of stuff there. What are all these things? Software! Who made these things? Not you, right? So, you know, they're great! Photoshop is really good and an amazing piece of software made by very large company and lots of people and you need Photoshop, you have an image, you wanna get rid of the red eye you wanna make it brighter you wanna do some kind of, I don't know, filter on it to make it look like it was taken thirty years ago, I don't know if Photoshop does that, you use Photoshop, but there are limits to what Photoshop can do it is a tool with a set of features that are provided to you via an interface and you can't make it do more that it does and in fact if you want to be creative if you wanna develop your own ideas whether they're art or a commercial product or some just weird strange exploration you don't wanna, you don't wanna be limited by the tools that are provided for you you want to start with a blank slate, you know, if you want to create a new image processing filter that doesn't exist you could do that. In this video series you will learn to do that, and it's not very hard! I mean, there are aspects of programming that are incredibly hard this won't be easy don't get me wrong but this is really what we're talking about here everything that you do whether it's working with images, working with animation, writing, checking your email, interfacing with hardware, robotics, everything that you do digitally starts from somewhere, somebody wrote the software to make this stuff work why couldn't that person be you? what types of things could you invent? what types of ideas could you come up with if you weren't limited to the list of tools that you can download, purchase, and get from, you know, other individuals might have released as open source or big companies, let's break all those bonds, let's write your own software, and that sounds very grand and ridiculous and then we're gonna be like and now what you're gonna learn is there's a red circle on the screen and it moves back and forth so don't me wrong, this is going to be a slow process this is really just the beginning I'm gonna show you some basic stuff you're gonna have to take it much farther but this will get you started in that direction if you and hopefully will be great. now there's also the question, if this is maybe why you should learn, how you should learn that's a more complicated one I'm not prepared to answer it, I'm just gonna try as best I can to communicate to you and provide resources but again this just brings up the question there are so many resources online that are terrific there are online courses you could take there's Code Academy, there's the Khan Academy, there's Udacity there's schools you can go to, there's a new experimental school called the School for Poetic Computation that's opening there's lots of stuff out there so this is just a little resource through video, I'll try to supplement it with code examples online with links below the video I might hopefully create a site with some other tools at some point but right now me talking, examples you can download, diagrams, but there is something I think is important to mention here which is a lot of the tools that you might first of all, you know what's a nice way to learn? Find a friend, find someone you don't even know, sit in a room with other people try to program with them, ask them questions, look at what they're doing, try to explain your program to a friend, be with people, right, we can all try to design the most fancy, best whatever online tool that will like show you the steps and give you immediate feedback and step you through give you this exercise and give you all this, right, but being with people and talking to people talking through your ideas, that is probably the best way to learn, now that's not what's happening here I'm by myself which is a little bit weird but I'm getting used to it a lot more used to it than I was before but one thing I will say also that's a little bit different here is a lot of the tools and courses, you know, that you might take whether it's a high school class a college class an online class firstof all they might have the word "Computer Science" in them Computer Science is a really great field of research and study of the science of computing, this is not that, we're just learning about computation how to write programming, how to write code, how to program and applying it to whatever you might be interested in. are you interested in biology and could the tools of computation help you there? Are you interested in music and could the tools of computation be something you could use with music and this is the other thing, that I don't have a test for you to take don't have something to say like "and you will make this" when you're finished with these videos the point of these videos is for you to have a creative idea and you don't have to have that now you might get inspired or try experiment s and it doesn't have to have any practical value, now you might want to get a job which I think is important in a lot of ways, but you might also just feel like "I like sorbet, and I like bugs, particularly spiders, and I'm going to create a simulation of spiders eating sorbet," which actually makes no sense whatsoever but that's the point you might have some idea that apparently doesn't have any practical value that makes any sense but you just want to explore it could be a visual idea a it could be a musical idea could be a website, an app, you know, this isn't really going to be about making products and apps and stuff for the web, as you're gonna see, as much but the point is you will develop your own ideas and make them and hopefully share them with others in some way, so I will try to give little exercises and little questions and push in particular directions but how you will learn in this particular context will be about coming up with your own creative project ideas and using the tools of computation to realize those ideas and hopefully that will be a nice thing. If anybody has success with that and finds it useful I'd be thrilled to know. Okay, so that's the end of this particular introductory video and I think the next one is, I'm going to talk about actually "What is programming, what does it mean to write, what is programming, what is an algorithm, what does it mean to program the computer?"
