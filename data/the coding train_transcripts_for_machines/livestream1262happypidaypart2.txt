hello good afternoon welcome to part two of happy pi day on the coding train which is me again Daniel Shipman I am wondering if the music is sounds ok efforts all glitchy like it was this morning this morning I did two coding challenges themed round PI one coding challenge involved I don't see anyone saying anything in the chat it's always oh hi again great one coding challenge involved estimating or approximating the value of Pi using the a ratio of the area of a square to a circle so I did that complete head to snaps in a circle I also did a coding challenge where I sort of visualize the digits of pi very poorly I almost feel like that should just get thrown away but hopefully that'll be useful I'm gonna do another coding challenge right now where I visualize the digits of pi and but I'm going to do it in a book the goal is to make a book and I'm gonna start with a grid I tried this this morning and I got all turned around in my head so I had a moment I had a little sandwich I made myself some coffee I'm back so hopefully my voice feels a little scratchy so but hopefully I will make it through and what I'm going to attempt to do is design a book or a pink about as a poster first or even just a processing window where F which is a grid of tiles and every tile could display a particular digit of pi or a visual representation of that digit and one idea that I think came in through one of the github suggestions was to represent each digit as a polygon so 0 would be nothing 1 would be a point 2 would be a line 3 would be a triangle forward be a square 5 would be a Pentagon 6 would be a hexagon that sort of thing see I remember where all these things are septagon octagon 9 to takata 9 at 909 toccata Kentico to go to a dig on and then dodecahedron right there was at ten oh boy I was doing so well Tyler Davis asks if I will do a back flip and I will not know no amount I mean I will I try but I first of all I already have all sorts of issues going and I know I could not do a back flip alright nonagon dov'Ã¨ gone ok nonagon thank you alright so me and cat took Tong alright so look here's a bunch of digits of pi so I'm just gonna jump right in because I let me close this let me close this what do I got going on here that that doesn't need to be open processing needs to be open so let's see here let's include the let's keep that string of Pi by saying load strings PI 1 million txt index 0 and then 3 point in front of it okay so this should if I'm right let's get rid of this let's get rid of that nightmare this should I'm gonna get rid of the 10 million this is the 1 million ok and so and let's just make sure this works by chucking there we go great 1 million and 3 why is it 1 million in 3 shouldn't it just be 1 million in did I do something of that file 1 million in 1 I think I did something that file by accident probably like because I opened it in TextEdit I probably added like a space or something though I added a line break save glad I noticed that nope why is it still a thousand and one characters that makes me sad oh look I added something there and I by accident ok there we go ok I'm glad I noticed that boy would not like to have the first digit of pi be something weird yeah load string splits yeah ok letter I at the start thank you Jacob in the chat all right stretch everybody stretch before you start dealing with digits of pi elbow doesn't Bend all the way straight on the right side but it's okay I'm doing fine all right are you ready because I was born not ready at all I was definitely I've never been ready for anything mostly I'm just very not ready but let's go oh Tushar remembers 3.14159265 35 feet 979 that's way more than I could possibly remember hello and welcome to yet another Pi Day 2018 themed coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm going to attempt to make something that I am calling the book of Pi something exists like that already I want to make a book in the form of a PDF file that has maybe 1 million digits of pi visualized in some way you could flip through it and read it because well one thing I would actually have the digit make up high out of Pi so I have an issue which is that I have too much cable here we're gonna start over and we will have this book at the ready Joel in the chat rightz my love for pi is highly irrational but love it alright hello welcome to another pi day 2018 themed coding challenge and in this coding challenge I'm gonna try to make something which I am calling the book of pi now I really like kind of a strange person that you you've already well aware of this I really like books that are just full of numbers I'd like to read them quietly to my children at night time for bedtime 69 thousand one hundred and three fifty six thousand five hundred sixty these are some random numbers from the book of a million random digits now I would love to say more about this book I'll include a link to more information about this book in this video's description but what I would love to have in my hands is a book with a million digits of pi maybe ten million digits maybe a hundred million I don't know as many digits I could fit into a book so then from there perhaps even it would be you might think about making a giant poster that has every digit and then visualizing each digit at something like a color or a shape or creating your own piece of art from the digits of pi so I want this video to be a place a video that you can watch to get you started on this so what I'm gonna do to figure this out is I'm gonna first of all I'm gonna use processing which is a Java based programming environment from the processing foundation much more information about that below in the video description as well and I already have in the in this the data folder a text file with 1 million digits of pi I will include when I publish the code for this I will also include a link to ten million digits and 1 billion digits and you can find more as well so but I'm actually going to comment this out because what I want to do first is I just want to have a system by which I can render a grid because ultimately I'm going to have a grid of all the digits on each page and I want to render each digit individually right one thing I could do is just take that text file and do print so depite export to PDF that I want to be able to render all the stuff in an artistic way so I mean I'm not good at artistic way I want to show you how to do it so you the person watching with artistic talent can make something or just if you had some creative experimental idea don't feel any pressure to make anything quoteunquote artistic artistic with a lowercase a alright so let's start by I'm gonna create a nested loop with Y on the outside and this is I'm gonna do this in a sort of weird way I'm gonna say W equals I'm gonna just arbitrarily pick some numbers and I'm gonna so I'm gonna have a width and a height and have them both be 12 through the matters I tried to do this earlier today and I kind of mucked it up so I'm sort of thought about it a bit more which doesn't mean that I'll anything will be close to correct but I now have a nested loop and what I want to do in this nested loop is I want to draw a rectangle at every x and y that is the size of width and height and I want to give it a random color so let's just start like this the reason why I want to do this I want to see okay I can draw a grid of random colors now what I want to do just to get started is let me represent each digit of pi with a grayscale value so 0 only black be black 9 will be white and every other digit will be some color in between so how can I do that now what I can do is I can load my digits of pi file I this this is actually in there because the the file doesn't have it just starts with 1 4 1 5 9 actually don't want to include the 3 point but maybe if I make it a text version of it I will want that later so let me take that out so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a variable called index and all the way through the loop I'm gonna separately increment that index and I am going to get string digit equals PI car at index and maybe I want to turn that into a number right now so why is this oh it would want to be a character mmhmm let's will that know oh boy oh boy ah let's convert that to a string this is the awkward whose is awkward I don't know what I'm doing then somebody in the chat would tell me a better way but let's call this s and then I'm gonna say it digit equals I'll just convert that quickly from a string to a digit so I could have made it anyway so let's let's start with that and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a color I'll call it bright for brightness which I'm going to map that digit which goes from 0 to 10 to between 0 and 255 um so 9 should really be so I think what I'm gonna do just I'm gonna make this 256 and make this 9 no no 255 sorry 0 through 9 will that work I'm so confused already and this should be a float and actually yeah all right so let's let's do this okay here we go let's see what happens these are I think the digits of pi mapped to a grayscale value so the 9 are we seeing 9s are we seeing white the color white this could be a nine so what I would actually like to do now is write the digit in there so I could kind of debug this and see if it's working correctly so what I also then want to do is say text the digit oh I have a random in there oh the random thank you thank you to the chat this random should not be in there I thought that looked a little weird there we go so this looks better now 3.1415926 this seems right so so maybe I won't write the numbers right let's write the numbers in there just to be sure because I want to be able to write the numbers eventually so I'm also gonna say text the digit I mean I could use the digit at that X&Y and I'm gonna say fill 255 minus bright I'm just gonna invert the color and let's just see what happens there you can sort of see there are some numbers but they don't match up right so one issue is that when I draw a digit at this location right that top left it's actually appearing above so this is the wrong digit I want the digit to appear at the bottom so it should be y + H and I also want to say textaligncenter which should give me the okay that didn't work right because oh because so I'm going to say this I could probably I'm gonna say X + w / let's do that let's run this again does that I missed it okay see you again now now this looks right right one four one five nine two six five so we can see that it is mapping to the correct colors wonderful okay we're getting somewhere now these don't really look like squares to me weirdly did I say width and height width height height width twelve twelve I don't know maybe that's an optical illusion and I'm being told in the chat that I should try Center Center can ivory aline Center as well yep and then I could say height y plus height divided by two and now the digits are perfectly in theory perfectly aligned in the center of these what I believe to be squares you know what it is it's an optical illusion the fact that the characters are kind of elongated I think is tricking me into thinking those are taller than they are why okay so now we see that so here's the thing I want to turn this into a book or I at the very least want to render a huge version of it so the way that I want to do this is with the PDF renderer in processing so I'm going to go to the web and I'm gonna go to processing website reference actually libraries PDF export so one of the things processing has this size function where you typically will set the width and height of the window you can also set the renderer a renderer might be P 3d for 3d graphics but a renderer can also be PDF and when it renders to PDF it's not rendering the pixels of what you seeing it's actually drawing the vector based lines and shapes of what you're drawing so that this is now some you could blow up to be super highresolution or important to some other kind of program that works natively with vector files so so but actually instead I want to be able to still see what I'm doing on the screen so I'm going to go and get the look at this example with a screen display and I can actually just use size as normal but call begin record so I'm gonna say oops ah actually I don't okay I don't need to copypaste this I'm gonna say right here begin record book of Pi dot PDF I think that's all I have to say no oh PDF write PDF yes because begin record could also I think render out like a 3d model I think it's another version of and then I at the end I want to say and record so let's run this again oops oh I forgot I have to import the library so for to be able to do it I have to import processing PDF dot star this is Java syntax for importing a separate Java library so we see this here and now if I go to the sketch folder there's a PDF called book of Pi and I can blow that up and run around look at that so you can see here so even though it's zooming in I want to zoom in this way so you can really see right no matter how far i zoom in I don't lose any quality because this is actually drawing the vector path to this PDF now one thing we should look at is the size of the PDF this isn't so bad 163 kilobytes we're in good shape here one thing that I think that I want to do is let's change the well actually let me take out drawing the text I'm going to cook I'll come back to that now I just want to see how big can I make this so if I make this so what would be now let's say I want to fit all million digits into one page so let me keep it at 400 400 mmm let me think about this let me actually make this 800 by 800 just to start with something larger a million the square root of 1 million is what 1 thousands so if I want to have a thousand columns and a thousand rows let's start with something smaller let's start with a hundred columns and a hundred rows then the width should be the width divided by the number of columns the height should be the height divided by the number of rows right so this should be a that and then if I do print line I'm just curious index this should have gotten to 10,000 right this should show 10,000 rectangles there you go so that's 10,000 rectangles and that is now also in this PDF which is still right there so I can zoom all the way in and we can see I can zoom all the way out can I do view I just wanted to zoom to fit I guess it's already done that okay so we can see there it is okay now let's see if we can get all 1 million digits of pi so let's change this to one thousand one thousand in theory I shouldn't worry about the size of the window it's sort of irrelevant at this point although there's an issue with the numbers getting so so small that that might make the PDF rendering kind of wonky let's see what happens so this is gonna take a long time hold on take a break go get a cup of tea I'll be back I'm checking my email no stroke I should do 1000 by 1000 oh yeah this is gonna be a disaster yeah first of all I got an error out of range I'm back I didn't work actually got an error string index out of range 1 million so the index should never have gone to 1 million but I think I probably have a little bit of a rounding error so I'm just gonna right now I'm just gonna like not worry too much about that and say if index index is greater than s dot length then greater than or equal to X dot length index should equal s dot length minus 1 so this will at least get rid of that error but I just realized something if this is 800 by 800 and I'm playing to have a thousand by a thousand that's definitely not going to work I don't even have that many pixels so I possibly draw that many rectangles so let's try doing the size now this is why I kind of probably want to not bother to render a preview and I actually have a whoops sorry if this popped up this is why I might not want to bother to render the preview the preview is gonna be irrelevant but I'm sort of wondering if it kind of will make do once it goes to the PDF because this the actual pixel dimensions are irrelevant so I'm just curious I'm gonna let it go again and see what it does it shouldn't look like anything in the window but maybe we'll see something so 13 megabytes so this is the PDF I got that didn't seem to work it's all in there though cuz it is 13 megabytes oh well maybe it's just really slow to appear let's try let's try creating a larger window size even if it's larger than what I can see on the screen so what I want to do is actually I'm gonna say no stroke ooh this was for the text I'm gonna say no stroke to get rid of the outline of the rectangle and then also I am going to make this the size of four thousand by four thousand which should at least give me a 4x4 or 2x2 rectangle let's see if that what that does so it's much bigger than what I can display on my screen so I see all I still I'm a little concerned of my computer's ability to display the PDF some things there hmm that doesn't look right either this is the penis something in that PDF for sure let me go back and look here did I make some weird mistake mmm yeah I definitely want to use color mode HSB that's the next thing I'm gonna do to what extent oh yeah I have a new idea one is I'm gonna get rid of the PDF rendering and what I'm actually going to do is I am going to use create graphics so I'm gonna create an offscreen graphics context that's much bigger than the window and I'm gonna say P graphics and I'm gonna call this a canvas and I'm gonna say canvas equals create graphics that's I'm gonna make this quite big 16,000 by 16,000 gonna make a huge graphics window I think processing should be able to do that and then I'm just gonna have the actual size of the window be 800 by 800 and I still want to have columns and rows and now I want to say everything should be done as part of the canvas so instead of rendering to the window and though so now I want to say canvas fill canvas dot stroke canvas rectangle and then I am going to oh I just noticed something I just noticed something that I forgot about this is integer arithmetic so that's gonna really mess stuff up especially when I had only 800 pixels that's why I didn't see anything so let me make these just to let me make these floats because an integer divided by an integer will always be an integer oh no these were floats though never mind since column and rows were floats I'm wrong about that that actually doesn't matter here okay but it's weird that it's printing out the index still a zero oh because because when it gets to the end it shouldn't be zero but let's keep going with this canvas fill no stroke rectangle so now I need to say instead of begin record and say canvas dot begin draw and at the end so this offscreen canvas I could say end draw you can draw to it just like the window and then I can actually just draw the window right there draw the canvas right into the window so let's not go crazy let's make the offscreen canvas 800 by 800 and let's just have 40 rows and 40 columns okay there's some other weird mistake in my code s dot length two pi dot length oh look at this what a disaster I wasn't looking at pi anymore this whole time this whole time this whole time oh there we go hey look it's working now so let me just keep going with this method and I'll come back to the PDF this was good to look at anyway so now let me make the size actually 8,000 by 8,000 let me just do 200 by 200 what whoops no the size should be 800 and let me have this be 8,000 by 8,000 and let's see what happens here whoa something went wrong canvas dot with canvas dot height rows columns canvas dot oh I need to say I need to shrink it down now if they're not the same size so this is the giant thing now but if I were to say canvas dot save you know PI Post this is the poster of Pi and I say PNG poster of Pi dot PNG that's not right oh semicolon I'm gonna run this come on you can do it you can save it there we go all right so now it rendered it I see my preview here and if I go here we have PI poster which is a two megabyte file I can take a look at that and we can see this is what it actually is zoomed in so now can I fit all 1 million digits let's make that happen so now I'm gonna have a thousand by a thousand I'm gonna make it sixteen thousand by sixteen thousand so each each rectangle will be sixteen pixels by 16 pixels I think that's about right who knows who knows my math is off this is gonna take a while to render let's hit save bo go make yourself a cup of tea and I'll be back when it renders or what it says right here out of memory okay wait and we already got the out of memory error so one thing is I could go back to my nice PDF world which I wouldn't have this issue necessarily and but I can actually do better than that let's take a look at the processing preferences and go to here oh I've already given it four gigabytes of memory so I've already done this all right let's try making this smaller let's do let's do let's try 4,000 by 4,000 that should be fine all right see you in a bit oh there it is so 4,000 by 4,000 you can see here this is all that it's all one million digits of pi all in one window and if I go now to here poster of Pi a 1.2 megabyte file I open it up and look at this this is it this is it everybody this is now a a 4,000 by 4,000 RGB image with all the digits of pi okay we're getting somewhere we definitely should use HSB mode that'll be much more fun let's push it let's push it a little let's make it 8,000 by 8,000 to see if we can make that happen and let's change this to let's say I think I have to say canvas color mode canvas color mode HSB and let's just say one point oh let's have everything beef between zero and one and so now I should be able to say map this would be now be the hue and I should be able say hue 1 1 and this should go between 0 and 1 and actually be much easier just to say digit divided by 10 R divided by 9 right because I want to get to one point oh I think yeah all right so let's see what happens here that didn't work that's what I got that doesn't look right fill canvas colormode HSB one fill maybe is color mode not let's let's make this small just so we can figure this out let's make this small again whoa what happened here oh so let me let me indeed run this we see nothing let me try color mode oh did I say 250 no cuz I I made the this should know let's go back to what I'm used to oh I know if the problem was floating point math always gets me every time it's like the Vista of Java yeah so I think I was right all along I'm gonna have some level of confidence here loose a lot of blue oh right color mode back to I think No wait a sec here what have I got going on here Phil I just wanna tell you ten by ten it's just nice stroke mmm the brightness is one isn't it oh the brightness is one like these should be less like somewhere in the the middle like no cuz it'll be white no no oh it'd just be well yeah but so one thing I just want to know is let's leave it default there we go but it's not HSB because it doesn't actually take it from canvas dot really oh no no how come I'm not getting just HSB mode not work in this HSB mode not work in create graphics kind of want to take out the canvas dot let me just do that real quick took out all the canvas drawing oh yeah so for whatever reason I'm not able to get HSB mo to work oh I had it after begin before begin draw ah maybe that's the issue let's see was that the issue did I have it there there we go so let me let me back up here yeah okay this was the problem spent a lot of time debugging that you could check the live stream if you want to see it a little 10 minutes of me searching for this but I called color mode before I said big begin draw which is really a problem that's a very bad thing that's not going to work so I need color mode to happen after and in this case now I can I can set the hue I could set the hue I could I could I mean I should be able to now put it back to 11 if I want to use color mode HSB with a range of 1 from 0 to 1 and I should see there we go so now I see these are some digits of pi with a different hue saturation and brightness and maybe just for our eyes let's make the this seems kind of maybe do I want the brightness higher but the hue the saturation I don't know what I'm doing oh I think I just want it not as bright but I want it like I want it fully saturated yeah whatever you can your problem this is the problem I have a problem what my kids used to say so the problem is I'm terrible at design so but we're good it's where it's functional and you are better at making something beautiful than I am okay so let me go back now and say 1000 columns 1000 rows eight thousand pixels eight thousand pixels and here we go cut cut cut fulbright and zero such what I want full brightness and saturation I don't know it looked so weird let's go back to full brightness and saturation and now yeah I'm going I'm running it again with full brightness and saturation just to like leave it in the sort of default state here we go oh and I want this to be nine all right here we go ready I'll be back in a minute once it renders there we go tada there it is 1 million digits of pi all mapped to a to a different hue and let's actually open up the let's take a look at the PDF um it's not a PDF sorry the PNG which is just a 2.6 megabyte file and I can zoom in on it and we can sort of scroll around and see these are all the digits of pi mapped to a given hue so now we're getting somewhere now here's the thing I wouldn't go back to PDF land let me see if I could render this to a PDF okay because I think the issues I was having before didn't have to do with the PDF rendering they had to do with my own other kinds of mistakes so what do I need to do I'm gonna change this from and say let me think about let me think okay everybody stay calm I think what I would like to do is do the PDF rendering without seeing a preview because I think I could sort of double up the code and draw everything to canvas and the PDF but I think what I want to do is actually if I go back to the processing reference I want to do this single frame no no display okay because I'm just gonna trust in my code so I'm gonna get rid of I'm gonna what I'm actually gonna do is I'm going I'm gonna save a new version of this so that's like a version that renders a PNG file I'm going to say PI day five I got to rename all these and so I can muck around with this a little bit more I'm gonna take out the canvas I'm gonna take out the canvas I am going to again I'm gonna put this back to a hundred and a hundred I'm gonna say I'm gonna say a PDF book of PI dot PDF then I am going to say columns and that's good load the load the data up here then I don't need to begin record anymore if I'm so this is gone and now all of my canvas dots should be gone again because I should be saying just color mode with height hike with all this bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla this is some ridiculousness there that I don't need I don't need to draw it anymore I don't need to save it anymore what I just need to do is say exit so when I use the PDF renderer here it will automatically render everything to this PDF and then exit the program so this shouldn't take very long to run let me just run it and I don't see anything because now I have to go and look at this PDF which nicely there's only 114 kilobytes I can open it up and there it is why is it not a square it is a square I just I just don't know how to use the computer I wanted to zoom to fit I don't know why it's not doing that let me just do this yeah okay so there you go there it is it's a PDF then we just can see that this is a vector drawing because no matter how far i zoom in as much as it'll let me I still have sort of a nice quality there alright now let's get a little more ambitious let's have it be 500 by 500 and let's make the size a thousand by a thousand and really the size is sort of irrelevant at this point so we finished there it is this is now a poster PDF and I can zoom all the way into with all the digits of pi and now is it gonna be okay I think it'll be okay why not why not 9 and 0 or both red that is a good point because I'm using hue saturation brightness hue is an ant is think of it as an angle on the color wheel 0 to 360 and 1.0 and zero would be the same so this should be divided by 10 thank you for that excellent point me I am swimming in the chat let's run this again it hasn't stopped yet I should put so think like print line finished it finished though because I can see that the play button became disabled so let's look at this one more time it's an 11 point 5 megabyte file now and I'm going to open it up and there it is 1 million digits of pi all with a different hue arbitrarily on a grid do you see the secret encoded magical messages there these are such mono it's it's just it's just having a lot of trouble rendering it but you can see it's slowly coming into focus all right now I want to do something really exciting because guess what I want to do this oh I already did all 1 million so what I want to do now I could do 10 million I'm gonna open up no no no let me not be so ambitious let me make it a hundred by a hundred so if it is one oh that's a thousand pages so let's say I want to have it one thousand a hundred thousand per page to have it what's the square root of a hundred thousand I can get ten thousand per page that's what I'm doing here ten thousand per page that won't be that many pages let's do it yeah let me just easy math I don't care if it's a lot of pages 100 by 100 let's see what this looks like so we can see this is now 100 by 100 so that's one thousand ten thousand ten thousand that's ten thousand digits of pi represented as a hue okay now who okay this is very exciting what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna say for int I equals zero I is less than 10 so this is total pages I'm gonna say page equals zero no no let's just use I I is less than total pages I plus plus so total pages equals pi dot length divided by columns times rows print line total pages right this is if I only have it 100 by 100 but I have 1 million digits than I need and 110 thousand this is how many pages I need now I can say this many total pages in debt and then I can I'm gonna say print line page I complete has one page I complete I'm gonna put another bracket here and then I'm going to say ah so now if I go back to here what I for multiple pages I need access to the PDF render itself which I can grab right here after setup and then I can say PDF dot next page so I'm now going to make a multipage PDF with ten thousand digits on each page ready for this I'll be back when when it finishes or has an error I'm not sure which one oh that was kind of anticlimactic I could actually already see that I have an error here the variable total pages does not exist so I forgot to say int I want this to be an int okay let's try this again should never use the drum float does not match with int because these are columns and rows are floats that's insane what's wrong with you and then this needs to be a float okay this this fear flood I'm gonna just just just take your time these could probably be into boy Java you are fun okay wait alright I'll be back it's gonna render oh wait it finished 98 99 according to this it finished I now have a it's still a 10 megabyte PDF if I go to view thumbnails look at this page 1 page 2 page 3 page 4 page 5 page 6 page 7 all the digits of pi alright let's just see if processing can do 10 million digits okay so I'm basically done what I would love to see is like I'm gonna obviously this code will be on github I want to make a version that just like actually has the raw digits in it what's the most kind of interesting or strange way we can represent it can you fit it all into a big poster can you make a book let's make a coding train book of Pi together as a community won't that would be fun but before I go let's just push let's push it a little Thank You Andres Calibri creator of the OpenGL processing library we always like to say that okay oh did I do I still have it wrong the hue no no that's fine okay okay so now what I want to do is I'm gonna change this I have a 10 but I don't have the 10 million file so let me go get that 10 million file here it is thank you to this CS course or something at Princeton that I mean Pi Day whoops where am i processing pi day 5 PI 10 million save this file there I also by the way I have a link to a file with 1 billion digits so what I'm gonna do now let's see so I want to load the 10 million should we make it a 10 page book with 1 million each page now let's keep it with 10,000 on each page it's not too many pages 10 million oh let me just say book of Pi 10 million so I don't overwrite my other file when this inevitably dies wait let's put let's put like some more is this gonna be a round number 10 million divided by 4 40000 probably not anyway let's just keep it to 10,000 per page that's just gonna be a thousand pages right yeah or something like that who cares it'll compute it for me ready let's watch the console here we go we just need to get to a thousand pages I'll be back when that happens this is way more fun than I could ever possibly imagine okay page 999 completes depleted so in theory okay hey fell down train whistle in theory this file here woo whoops this is kind of a large file it is 104 megabytes it is a PDF that has a thousand pages in it with a rectangle with a hue map to the digit of pi it has ten digits what has gone on so I have no I've sort of suspect that my computer might have a little trouble opening this file but let's take a deep breath and open it anyway let's close this one and let's open this actually amazingly it did it instantly and there we go all ten all thousand pages all 10,000 digits now I wonder if you might just double check this for me I'm on page 80 and if you could just check if this sequence is correct I didn't make any mistakes with my code that would be really nice thank you very much I really want to see it with the digits ah okay but I gotta end this video um I hope that you make something with this make a poster that vivid and by the way one I'm really limited in my thinking here right because I am thinking only in terms of this works like linear order of columns and rows but it's so arbitrary right the digits of pi are one dimension or perhaps they're in some multidimensional space that we can't even understand but the fact that I'm arranging them in this sequence you should remember is completely our so mutt might be another way that you sequence these or visualize these in a giant PDF whether it's a poster or a book or something else share with me I'm gonna work on my own on making maybe I'll make maybe I know maybe I'll just make another video real quick all right make the text version of this so I'll see you at perhaps if I make that video in that video otherwise have a wonderful pi day I'll see you in 2019 who's on what's on page from 2001 did I get an extra page by accident oh yeah so my math is off we can see there's a blank page here at the end all right so now I'm just gonna send this to the printer the color printer downstairs nobody will mind right let's put this into a book so what I want to do now just just to satisfy my own curiosity just to satisfy my own curiosity let's call this text let's say so let's get rid of I just want it let me draw the rectangle I could leave this fill in here actually for the text no the stroke zero that would still be black and HSB I believe yes fill stroke zero maybe I should just make China it does it make sense to make a followup video oh I just call the next page at the end of the loop always that makes sense I mean should I make a followup video of doing the text and like I don't know what's what could be nice about that is I could actually do it with a non fixedwidth font the way that I built this and have these the X sort of move according to the width of each character that would be kind of interesting let me just let me just try this real fast and let me say ya know Phil I mean this is crazy for me to do let me let me just do the let me load the 1 million so I'm just quickly rendering the text version of this oh I have to do 100 pages do I have a smaller file let me get a small let me make a smaller file well or can I put oh I forgot about my whole idea of visualizing the visualizing the polygon thing and I was excited by that I'm too lazy to like make up smaller fiveoh so I have to wait till all nine ninety nine pages render like well I'll do it with 1 million it'll take less time than ten thousand see this is actually I'm finally actually doing something that makes sense I mean this would be I think highly problematic to try to do in JavaScript I would think oh whoa wait why does it have it shouldn't have a fill for the rectangle all right let me make all right I think I need to finish for today it's 330 and I could keep going with this forever and ever and ever but there is there are other things to do I think this is pretty good and I can work on the text version later somebody else will make one and I can show them next time all right anybody have any other questions you want to ask well I'll be back before 2019 I just meant the next pi day won't people 2019 although pi approximation day as we know I'm just trying to understand why the rectangle oh did I not ever set up I never set a background it's actually it's not doing anything oh I just never set a background of 255 so it's working and I can actually also take out let me take out the rectangle hold on everybody I just I've been might as well do this right now except I won't have the code the code will be different than what I started what I show in the video all right hold on let's back up let's just do this as another video I'm seeing silly I can't go sleep at night if I don't finish this so I think this is back to where I was right okay I can't resist I'm gonna do one more coding challenge video first of all I forgot I had this idea of trying to do the different like polygons for each one of these cells I'll leave that as an exercise to the viewer anyway I talked about different things you could do but I just want to see I want to kind of see the numbers so I'm gonna try to do this in a just to see how that works I'm not gonna do I'm gonna keep everything just black and white just the pure text but I'm still gonna draw each character each number one character at a time because that would allow for a lot more possibilities obviously again if I just want to make a book of all the digits open up the text file print export to PDF etc but I'm gonna draw each digit one at a time so let me try to alter this to do that so couple things one is let me do save as and do pi day 6 this is like apparently the sixth thing I've made I'm going to go back to book of Pi I'm going to 1 million texts I'm gonna and then I'm gonna load the 1 million Pi file and I'm gonna keep it at 100 I should really make oh it timeout let me make a smaller text file and I'll be right back this is ridiculous because I got a save as pi PI file process so what I want to do is create a sketch really quick where I do what I did before and I say pi equals PI dot substring 0 whatever I want 1000 and then a string output equal so let's let's do this let's do int N equals 1000 and string output equals new string 1 output index 0 equals PI saved strings PI pi n oh there's no million pi dash n dot txt so now if I run this oh this this come and this should be output sorry I always get this wrong comment output so if I run this I should see now in a PI 1000 which does that look like a thousand digits to you I don't know that seems like if it's a thousand digits right okay so I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna go and open my PI day five but no pi day six actually yeah and what I'm gonna do is grab quickly from pi day five or PI D PI pi file process the 1000 file pi day six okay right anybody see anything I did wrong yeah one kilobytes a thousand digits that's about right right yeah okay and then this can be 10 by 10 all right I'm back I I quickly made a file that only has a thousand digits of pi because it's gonna be much easier for me to test this stuff so let's go through this let me get rid of HSB mode wait did I make do I need to save a new version or did I already save a new version what was pot so I got four as I get I'm lost like what was PI day five and they're not even like in their own folder this is really ridiculous no no pi day five is fine okay so I already made a new version I'm back I made a smaller song okay I'm back I made a smaller file with only 1000 digits of pi I think that'll be easier to work with let's make it just ten by ten so it'll still be a ten page PDF I'm gonna get rid of color mode HS I don't want to deal with that I'm still gonna have this idea of multiple pages I'm still gonna and now I'm not gonna draw rectangles anymore what I'm going to do is I'm going to say so first of all I need to I need to add a background so I'm gonna make a white back I'm gonna happen like the background white before I start drawing let's go down here and make the background white then I'm going to say here I don't I'm gonna just say fill zero so every piece of text and then I'm going to draw the digit at a certain location I had this from an earlier coding challenge and I think that's it this should give me all the digits so this is weirdly gonna happen pretty fast but as we're gonna see I'm going to need to do some clean up clean up here so it did all the pages and if I go to which one of this which book of Pi 1000 texts we should see yeah there we go so we could see one four one five so a couple things one is I would like to include the I'm not gonna worry about the three point so one thing is I didn't think about the size of the text so the text size should really be related to the size of the cell um so I do you all remember if this is a time out for a second with an edit point do you remember what I said I'm gonna take a half an hour break and go make ourself a cup of coffee and have some lunch I took that half an hour break and it came upstairs I forgot to do one thing so I'm gonna take a fiveminute break right now you can guess what that is little bathroom break here for a second and I'm gonna put because it's distracting me even though I probably be fine I am going to put on this dot song and mute my microphone and be right back digits of pi you okay oh okay I'm back I hope someone's gonna make me a pie song because I could really use a pie song now what I want to do now actually I'm curious here I think what I want to do is try to separate thing I should use a fix with if I was a file was to get more careful I would just use a fixedwidth font which was my plan but I'm actually kind of curious here because in theory I could change this for loop to be a while loop and I could say here float X equals zero while X is less than with and then at the end here I could say X plus equals text with of digit I think the textaligncenter is going to give me a little bit of an issue why is that not oh not digit text width of that string and actually if I'm drawing the text let's just get rid of the idea of digit entirely so I believe this will actually let's see what happens we won't we probably won't get we don't know how many pages we're gonna have so eventually we're just gonna so what I'm gonna do is say if in debt so I'm actually just gonna say break or I'm just gonna say how can I get out of both loops right here I mean I could say break cuz I'm in the wild like if I ever get to the end of what I have then I should get oh but I oh no no no let's use a fixedwidth font not the well I feel like the problem is now I don't know when to go to another page I don't have to test the why no that's fine though that's fine no no that's still gonna work still gonna go to the next page when I get down so let's let's let's do something let's create a variable boolean finish this is an awkward way of doing it but I know it will work equal false and so here what I want to do is I want to say finished if I ever get to the end finish just true and then think I could sort of say if finished right like will continue get me out of a return I could return no because I could return but I need to I need to get to this exit and since I'm just in setup yeah return would be good so one I call this void render book this is work this is going to be worth it I'm gonna say render book all that the loading stuff and this has to be a global variable now the loading stuff will happen in setups till then I'm going to take all of this and put it in render book exit' footprint lines finish and exit will not will be here then I'm going to say render book and all I have to do is not have any of this finished nonsense and just say return so this jump whoops I think I'm back hopefully the stream has come back and the computer is now back so sorry about that uh open broadcast studio seems to crash every once in a while I think I muted by the way when the wrong thing but I double muted so I think I was fine all right so where I was is I does anybody does anybody know where it died I better go back pretty sure I had pasted everything into the render book function return' with type 1 ok so in other words it died while I was typing return right here you said okay I'm gonna go back a little bit further just in case there was an issue with what it actually saved so okay sorry computer crashed maybe an awkward edit point so what I need to what I can do here is now say return to exit completely out of this function I don't need all this if finished stuff anymore the total pages is kind of wrong like I don't but I but I think it's fine like this will give me I think it's okay like I just need to actually I think this could be like a while true basically I can just keep doing new pages but let's just leave it for right now so I think what's going to an exit but I have like the wrong amount of brackets so render book do the double loop oh this in oh oh oh yeah this is a while loop right and I'm at the end of each of going based on the text width then index is going up if I get to the end I'm done otherwise I'm not finished to page oh there's a missing this is a missing curly bracket right because the page is done at the end of the this is the X loop this is the Y loop so if I highlight this it should that's the X this is the Y that's the end of a page okay so let's see what happens here oh and now I need to call oh this should this and this should be here this can be here and set up and then I want to say let me just run this okay nothing now I'm gonna call render look so hopefully they don't it'll just go until it runs out of numbers finished how come I didn't see how come I didn't see multiple pages hmm well let's see what I got did I get anything in the PDF oh oh because it fit in one page I fit in one page okay so it fits in one page because the numbers are all just right next to each other okay easy easy all right so now let's think about how I'm calculating the width and height so the number of columns in wrote there the idea of columns is no longer relevant right and the idea of rows is honestly no longer really because what I have is I want a font size so I want a font size which would be the default font size is 12 but let's just set that so I'm gonna set right here I'm gonna say text size 12 and so I'm told somebody the chat said have to be earlier that 120% of a text size is the proper like line spacing so if it's 12point text 12 times 1.2 this would be about fourteen point four and sort of the line height so in theory I should be able to have H be so the width should be twelve the height should be fourteen point four maybe just round it to fourteen but I'll leave it as fourteen point four and then I know this total pages thing is nonsense now because I can basically just say I could just say while true like keep doing more pages until you're done so let's see if this makes sense let's see what happens here look oh but I do want to count the number of pages so I'm gonna say into page num equals zero and I'm gonna say page num plus plus and it's gonna tell me when a page is complete okay page page none okay let's run this finished oh because it again does only needs one page this is looking pretty good there's all my digits let's add the three point three point one there right oh it's kind of cut off at the end there so let me be let me make sure it doesn't get cut off at the end so Y if X is less than Oh with minus W with Mike because I want to I want to cut it off before I could say maybe W divided by 2 but let's yeah W divided by 2 would be okay so let's do that that should fix that finished and now I have a new write that fixed that over on this side okay and by the way why not make this more like an eightandahalf by 11 piece of paper so let's have that be 850 1150 okay book of Pi let's go for 1 million and let's do PI 1 million book of PI million text okay you ready for this I don't know if it's going to work to go on to a new page but it's doing some pages how many pages is it gonna be to have all 1 million digits I'll be back oh oh no that's just a snare drum it's still going how do this turn into how to convert text to PDF I'm kind of surprised that it's going this many pages okay okay it completed at page 111 so now we should have this is the most insane way anybody has ever converted a text file to a PDF but there's a lot of wonder wonderful stuff what I'm doing here so let's look at this book of Pi 1 million texts and we can see here oh why didn't I get that oh I have to do this again it's bothered me that it doesn't say 3.1 there but we can see here look here's my book of Pi I fries some margins should probably some margins but here it is it's a hundred eleven pages of all and let's see how big this file is it's a 212 megabyte file which probably doesn't need to be cuz it's just a hundred pages of text but probably in the way that it's rendering it is a little bit crazy so okay let's let's just do one more thing let's go for ten million and let's add three point there so we're gonna add the three dot and we're gonna render ten million all right I'll see you if one about a thousand pages we should pay tribute about a thousand pages okay here we go I'll see you in a bit the kerning hurts me Oh Oh it's it's wrong okay hold on I got to fix that it's the textaligncenter that's doing that all right I didn't actually let that finish rendering because it was nicely pointed out to me that the kerning is off it's really quite off and this is because I'm using textaligncenter I think I have a nice I think I've so I could keep with textaligncenter but I have a quicker way that I'm gonna fix that so let me go back to the 1000 when we go back sorry to the 1000 digits we just load 1000 digits let me run this it'll be done very quickly I'm gonna open up this 10 million file one so you can see that the kerning is all off is spacing between the letters and that's because I'm moving according to ahead according to that digits with but it's aligned Center so I really have to average Izu move ahead by half of its width and half of the width of the next character but an easier thing that I could do is just textalignleft and then draw everything at X and so this should fix that let's just make sure oh and then I also need to change this to width divided by 2 so let's change this that's finished and if I go to you know it says 10 million that should be no it doesn't look right I'm a little concerned that it hold on let me make sure my PDF actually updated let me delete this file and let me look at it again it's created at 353 p.m. which is the time now that doesn't look right still interesting to see these what is wrong here let's just do textalignleft for a second without the center for why why is that wrong this has always worked for me in the past I'm drawing a digit and then I'm moving according to that and drawing the next one textalignleft I thought I am here this is the character I'm drawing that's the width of that character and the next one will be at this location according to what it previously drew right as it draws one and then moves ahead according to that ones with not the previous ones with I mean the three taht is messing it up I don't think so I'm looking at the YouTube chat so I could switch to a monospaced font I move according to the next one now instead of fixed with nobody the chat is being helpful to me I mean you are being helpful I just mean you guys are talking about a four papers which is not helpful to me let me think about this individual characters when I'm drawing I move I wonder if you know what I have a bad feeling that it's something to do with putting it in the PDF because this would this is sort of based on pixels and the PDF yeah they all line up vertically Oh something is whoa wrong I think the PDF rendering is doing something mmhmm I might have to just live with this right now or I could use a fix with fun right because I let me take out the just for the sake of argument here for a second watch let me show you this let's look at it without the PDF rendering no that's not really any better okay so that's a good sign yeah it's off that dot should be here why is it off all right so let me think about this let me make the font much bigger oh no this this I shouldn't be using anywhere okay I'm not oh there we go this is weird well that's okay that's just like approximate what am i using w anywhere else yeah that's fine that's sort of like silly but I'll just that W is irrelevant this is kind of it should just be like if the next character fits or not but I wonder if text width doesn't work properly if I don't specify the font oops I've definitely done this before without a problem is it is there a bug yeah look at that you can see how the one is giving a lot of space so hold on all right let's be a little bit more thought achill about this all right the three should be wider than the one oh boy that's not good that's not right little boy whoa boy is it because I'm in setup like do I need to get to draw somehow that doesn't make any sense though right like is one thing I could do I just say no loop yeah it's doing it does it not know how to do this with numbers well this feels like a processing bug I can't get anything to any two characters to be different oh all right yeah they're all the same so why is that that's weird no it's not a bug it's just how it works all right well I'm gonna switch to a monospaced fun no the X plus equals W is not aerial I know aerials not Manos paste so that's why I feel like these letters should be different widths but I'm not getting a different width well it's just an indication not a measured side all right why don't we I should just switch to a fixedwidth font how about that everybody text with only updates once in setup no I feel like I've done this with like a string just look at all these yeah these are different so I get different look at this so why do I not get that for the numbers yes II like T is so I get different widths for all the letters like I would expect and then if I do the digits they're all the same huh numbers often are not properly kerned are tracked in fonts oh well that's interesting the font is just organized that way all right this is what this whole thing will get cut because that was an exploration that went nowhere but it was useful and interesting I was where was I I was making the 10 million it's fine the kerning will just be off and I will change this to a fixedwidth font oops all right I'm actually stopping rendering that that file that was gonna have ten million digits in it because I've noticed that they Despain the numbers the kerning is off and actually I've done this before we're moving by text with works perfectly with with well doesn't work perfectly but I I don't have an issue with it but apparently the way this font is organized these the numbers are all that elbow all defined with the same width so I'm I kind of have done something wrong here I'm gonna switch to using a monospaced font why not so I'm gonna add to the code I'm gonna just say right here under render book I'm gonna say text I'm gonna say a P font F equals create font I'll just use courier I can use courier new but I think I'll just use courier and give it a size of 12 and then I'm gonna say text font F let me switch back to the 1000 1000 file just to test this let me run this it finished right one page let me look at this now 1000 whoops no wrong 110 million text whoops it could not open because it was empty what did I do wrong I messed something up oh I forgot exit exit needs to be in there okay let's try it again finished let's open that up and there now we can all breathe oops a sigh of relief all these numbers are nicely spaced from each other perfectly in mono spaced lined up exactly in organized fashion actually this is kind of nice because maybe we'll find some interesting patterns almost like a some sort of word search number search puzzle let's look at the it looks like we're oh I took out in my investigation of this I took out the textaligncenter so let me put that back in run this one more time it's now finished let me come back over here oh right I messed up some stuff and say with minus 2x plus with / I took out some stuff I why I was fussing around with trying to figure out the spacing finished and now there we go so I should add some margins let's add some margins let's say we're gonna start with X at 100 and Y at 100 we're gonna go to with 100 W and width and height 100 so okay so let's make this let's make this a variable int margin equals 100 margin margin margin margin and let's see what that does and finished that's fine it looks like about an inch whatever so now we have our book of Pi now here we go it is time I'm gonna go back we're gonna make this book have 10 million digits and I want to emphasize that the way that I program this you could render each number individually as anything you want because they're all rendered one at a time in processing with any drawing capabilities that you could imagine okay let's go back and say PI 10 million okay I'm really gonna run this and I'm really gonna be back when it finishes see in a minute go let's just make sure it's going okay I think I'm consuming it's gonna be like well over a thousand pages see you in a bit yeah I don't have to get the text with each and every time that's probably slowing it down but you really think I wonder if that's slowing the Det this down like a lot cause it was gonna take a while let me fix that well we haven't gone too far let me just run it again see if storing the text with really helps not really that looks slower to me now am I just like running out of memory or something like why is that way slower now am I crazy yeah that's so weird I wonder it's so weird it makes no sense but let's put it back oh I've been debug mode by accident maybe that's why hi boxing click debug mode that's probably why it was slower whoops now what did I do margin 100 page number zero oh I undid too much well I think did I hit debug mode is that what happened let me just try one more time or does my computer just need like maybe like processing needs to be restarted let's try that like it's really like well let's just do let's just do that right all right hold on let me restart processing save let me close out all this let me sort of free up some memory empty the trash close out a bunch of things cuz like feels like it's churning to a halt a little bit Activity Monitor alright memory preview little preview has got to be killed that's an issue finder processing Dropbox okay this seems fine I think maybe we're in better shape now alright ready everybody here we go well who wants to wait for this to get to a thousand I got some other work to do do you mind if I just do some of my other work I get a check my messages I mean cuz that's getting to without me this is not crazy I can wait for that to get to a thousand is that 50 already I just have to wait that amount of time 20 more times let me see if I have any important messages there's still two of them running in the background how are there two of them running in the background did I call render book twice no is it because I move stuff in to draw Oh before let's check Oh before there were okay I shouldn't start it over all right go computer go Oh guessing why it was slow okay [Laughter] seven minutes all right seven minutes we back in seven minutes I'm just checking out some stuff here oh oh oh this is a good time for me to mention my fundraiser I am running in a half marathon this Sunday I am matching any donations made today to this campaign Lower East Side girls club a wonderful organization that I have participated in some of their educational programs and so I'm gonna run 13.1 miles to raise a little money for the Lower East Side Girls Club if anybody wouldn't mind posting this into the chat wants to make a donation I would certainly appreciate that thank you very much okay so that's one thing I'll mention okay I'm gonna let this keep going I don't know that it's gonna be a thousand pages actually it could be like way more than a thousand pages because I don't I I added the margins I yes I would it's great to mention Stephen Hawking I don't know what else to say about that other than I was was a huge fan I still am a huge fan of Stephen Hawking I have read I don't know if I've read every single one of his books but certainly many of them and then the updated versions of them I don't know how many pages it's gonna be I could have pre calculated that I'm also curious will it report to me how big the file is while I'm running it No so let's look let's look at the memory usage the fan can you hear the fan so I don't know if it's showing up here under processing on a pi day so we're actually it's not going crazy here it's just currently using a small amount of memory in terms of the CPU usage it's definitely using that up and we're almost to 500 pages maybe we're about halfway through maybe check some new you know I'm I'm kind of exhausted by now it's four o'clock and I've been live streaming I had to take a break for about a half an hour 45 minutes was it an hour I don't remember but I started at about 1100 this morning so I don't think I'm gonna do anything else I'm just gonna let this finish and then I'll go okay I also have to go home because yeah by the way how many people currently are watching waiting for this to complete there should be some good I could read some numbers I'll let's read some digits of pi here this is just I could read a thousand digits of pi while we're waiting that's really at only a thousand digits right hun all right we'll keep an eye on the number see if it finishes all right now anybody wants to turn this into a song I'll be forever grateful problem is I have to look at the screen should I read it regular and then it'll be auto tune or should I try to sing it I'm gonna try to sing it Oh Alka seems to have calculating 855 why did you already render it so we're almost done better hurry up to read these 3.14159265 three five eight nine seven nine three two

four two eight one two eight four eight one one seven four five four ah seven four five zero two eight four one zero two seven 855 viewers not 855 pages I thought maybe somebody had calculated it yeah it'd be better to just oh boy I should have like you know what a mitten good maybe I should stop and restart it because they could report the progress like I could actually report like how many are on each page let's try to figure this out though think about this we can figure this out right the size of the box is well I'm gonna do this on my other computer right we can we can calculate this it's gonna be like fifteen hundred pages right this size of the box done there's eight hundred fifty five people watching that's insane this size of the right this would be really sad when there's a bug and it actually doesn't render 1 1 to 0 even one one to zero my calendar there's apparently something on my calendar that starts at 430 I think I got cancelled 1 1 2 0 8 60 was 110 pages for a thousand 1 million will be 1,100 to 1,200 that makes sense no but I'm doing 10 million I'm doing 10 million so no but I was able to fit 1000 fit like on the page with a lot of leftover room 78,000 P do it by the number of digits that have been used versus the number of digits total I added the margins how many we lost 15 viewers in the last few minutes ago shocked alright let me try to calculate this it's 1150 by 800 but minus a hundred for the margins minus 200 for the margins because it's 100 on each side so that's 950 by 600 that's the area each cell is what was it 12 pixels each cell well we don't know what the text with would anybody know can anybody I don't want to stop this can anybody tell me what the text width is of Courier text size twelve twelve point the text width of one character is well let me just guess it's twelve if it were twelve that would be twelve times fourteen point four so I can fit 32 about 3,300 on a page and so 10 million two three one two three divided by all of that how many pages I got 3000 pages my calculations 16 pixels is it really 16 because 16 will mess up my math right now I computed three thousand pages which I don't know if I have the stomach for if it's 16 pixels I just calculated 4,000 pages well at least we'll get maybe the some digits of pi in the number of pages 3.1 3003 thousand one hundred eight point six I don't think so okay I have to test this myself or maybe somebody in the slack Channel has yeah I could rerun the code but I don't want to because I could change a lot to sort of figure it out and I don't have the code on any other computer open a project and do it with a thousand yeah that's what I was hoping all of you following along could help me with it have you been following along couldn't you do the same thing and then someone else running this and started it a lot earlier and already is finished alright I am going to create a new processing sketch and I'm gonna say P font F equals create font courier twelve and then I'm gonna say print line text with zero and let me run that so I getting I should be able to fit more text font I didn't say text font F yeah I got seven point two is the width seven point two is the width which my math would then say I only need eighteen hundred pages maybe were yeah I'm the other thing I'm afraid of is that this is gonna run out of memory if it's how are we doing here let's look at this okay CPU usage no problem memory usage no we're good we're good we're good I think the multiple pages help well let's see let's see if it finishes before I'm gonna I'm gonna stay here at least till 2000 pages otherwise I will just do a dramatic ending of it still going I have to leave and I'm there like I'll be on like the subway of New York City with my laptop and the battery will run out though because I can't stop this program yeah but I'm literally advancing only the number of pixels so I'm not including because I'm not actually rendering the text as the text renderer would do I'm rendering each character one at a time okay I don't know what what sound effect I want start it again we have now fished at 1761 pages I have made a book just for reference this book is 200 pages this book is 200 pages I have now made a book that does seven 1700 I mean 600 pages 661 pages which in theory has 10 million digits of pi and plus the 3.1 so it actually has 10 million in two characters now let's go to my folder it is a two gigabyte file I wonder if I open it with like Adobe Acrobat Pro let's try opening with preview why not any preview we'll figure out how to do it I'm probably gonna have to this is probably gonna fail let me quit processing and quit TextEdit alright preview doesn't seem happy not responding let me try okay now preview didn't work let me now try opening this with I don't know Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Pro let's try Acrobat Pro that sounds fancy do I even have that I don't give me that as an option I must have some supper oh boy no Acrobat Pro for me okay yes I want to quit let's try Acrobat Reader agree yeah I agree take my book of Pi this looks good configured no no I don't want to be the default okay okay okay okay okay okay you gonna settle down settle down tutorial exit out of this I don't need to sign I don't not signing this document okay I don't need to sign in here it is this is the book of Pi it is to gave us now the absurd thing is once again is I could have just taken that text file and done print to PDF but if you wanted to you could render this and you could have I don't want to look close I don't want to see any mistakes you could I don't have the page numbers on it I should probably you CSS paged media and the whole other way like span tags oh I'll come back another time to do it a different way so but again I could have done the same exact thing but had these would be little blocks of color or anything so I will just do to finish off this video oh I made it go upside down I will read to you from page what page am I on I will reach you some why is the spacing off Oh cuz I have the center thing again I text the line center I need to text the line left I can't do it again oh I forgot to add page numbers chrome can open PDFs that's it alright now I I'm sorry that this spacing is off it really bothers me but we'll just have to go on I will read you a little bit of it and this video will fade away six eight eight five one one four five zero six four nine one three one five one eight six one five then there's some other digits for three in the mouse is really in an awkward place zero three one three one nine zero five six two seven one goodbye all right okay everybody that's the end for today yeah maybe it's an integer math problem floatingpoint problem because you're right if it's 888 isn't even so that's a bug I will be accepting pull requests to fix the spacing we'll do that another time I have to be done I am so I just feel like I wanted to eat really excited about this two gigabyte I don't know where to put it I know how to print it out I should be rainbowcolored with trains there should be it should be like it the book should have a flip should be a flip book so as you're also flipping through the book there's like a little animation of a train going train going by it's on a real animation the flip book animation so render it at a larger size so many things I could do wait for 314 likes okay how many people are watching right now I I will wait I'm first gonna check to see if anyone made the donation and I think maybe making donations to nonprofit causes of plugging them through a livestream oh my goodness holy smokes Michael D I have to read 320 that is unbelievable thank you that is so kind of you and nice of you to donate such a large donation that is getting me quite close to the goal that is really amazing to do that my goal for fundraising for Lower East Side Girls Club I really appreciate that I I must go now to the following I do have to leave but to thank Michael D I'm doing a file process and I am going to read do we get two did we get to 314 already over great I am going to finish this livestream by outputting 325 digits of pi I now have a file that for Michael DS donation I will read all of these digits and I'll even add 23.1 okay here we go everybody oops look this went too high I wish I had a monitor over there and I could see it on it I really need to do that 3.14159265 three five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six two four three three eight three two seven nine five zero two eight eight four one nine seven

seven four eight eight one five thank you Michael d all right I don't hope I didn't mess anything up much I am going to go I will just make sure there isn't I'm getting messages I don't know why my family just doesn't like turn on YouTube to find me and then type into the live chat because that would that would also reach me I've been I this is like about four times as much as I intended to livestream today and I think we're good okay great wonderful this is a thrill for me to get this extra donation to have made these projects and now I have a new goal I feel like I couldn't read a million random digits so that was that was 325 it just took a couple could I read 1 million digits of pi in one day on a live stream because I thought if I ever get to 1 million subscribers I would read 1 million random digits but I did the sort of math for how long that would take because these are numbers between 0 and 90 9999 it would probably take me Oh week without sleeping to read all the digits but I wonder if pie is realistic so I will see you all there will be no live stream this Friday there will be hopefully a live stream on Friday March 23rd I believe that will be the next one thank you for tuning in all of these video all of these will get edited and released at some point sort of insane how much that I did today so I've got a lot of content still to go and release I would like somebody remind me maybe add up to the rainbow topics repo I would like to make a processing library I mean I don't know if I want to show how to make a processing library using Eclipse Java and processing it some point I've got to get to that ok alright I will see everybody feel free to do what you will with all the weird stuff that I did today mash up cut chop release whatever and happy birthday pie happy pi day rest in peace Stephen Hawking happy birthday Einstein and check in with me on Sunday when I will be running my 13.1 miles ok goodbye
