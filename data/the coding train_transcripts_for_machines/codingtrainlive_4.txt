do do good afternoon everyone uh check one two i am just testing my mic let me know if you can hear me okay i do have the music volume up a little higher than i usually do so you can confirm for me whether it's a little too loud and i'll be starting in approximately one minute do so do hello happy saturday it's the coding trade again here we are every saturday even when i said i don't know when this was was it it was definitely at the start of january i think if not earlier if i would no longer be live streaming on the weekends because the weekends is not a convenient time for me to live stream and yet here we are again another saturday afternoon i am live streaming it turns out it's not exactly a convenient time but it is more convenient than the other times during the week that i thought might work out someday this will all change but for now i am here on saturdays actually just to get this out of the way the schedule is going to be quite light for the next couple months in terms of live streams there's a lot of new content coming out on the channel so you will get your fill of coding train without a doubt if you're interested in that but in terms of the live streams just to let you know um i will be live streaming next weekend most likely but that's like 50 50. then i will 100 definitely be live streaming put this in your calendar on march 19th that's not 100 actually let's put that at like 90 to 95 percent i have a guest coming and i will soon put that as an event on the youtube calendar of events because a youtube calendar event no but i will make it a scheduled live stream on the channel so it will appear on the youtube coding train home page on youtube and then i am going to be out of town not actually not really out of town i'm still going to be in new york but i will not be in brooklyn for a few weeks so there won't be unless something changes and i find some miraculous way with a good internet connection to live stream during that time i will there will be no streams between approximately march 20th and april 10th um so uh so there will be a bit of a lull there but lots of new content and uh you probably are aware i want to say hi to folks in the chat and see what's going on here but you're probably aware the focus right now of the coding train is most definitely on um nature of co tutorial so if you've just if you haven't been around in a while you're tuning in maybe for the first time ever or after a while and you haven't been following what's been going on the channel if you go to the codingtrain.com learning nature of code and uh you'll see this playlist of videos all of which were completed uh a year ago in the spring of 2020 then i had i don't know if you know a family know about what happened in the year 2020 a lot let me just say uh kind of lost steam with this project but i have firmly returned to it here in 2021 and all of the chapter 3 videos have been completed and published and guess what all of the chapter 4 videos which is only four videos four videos for chapter four four being the only number in the english language that has the length is the number of letters in the word of the number itself did you know that interesting facts by the way i kind of want to just completely change the coding train to a channel called facts about numbers i i've been sending these emails to my nyu course and i try to include a little like tidbit about like a number in them and then i realized like oh i love this so much maybe i should go through my random number book and just uh uh just completely pivot the content is just me it's asmr facts about numbers uh reading on the coding train anyway i was saying chapter four uh particle systems four new videos they've all been recorded it may take a little while for them to be publicly available on the channel this is my small little plug that if you would like a sort of sneak preview of those as they're in process so rough drafts and early versions i will share with members of the coding train in the coding train discord now the coding terrain discord which i will press this button is uh hopefully it just appeared in the chat it's available to everyone i encourage you to join we have a lot of new moderators shout out and thank you to the new moderators um it's a place where hopefully it's welcoming and friendly a familyfriendly place where you can get um help with your code there's a lot of different help channels i could show you these things right now but i'm just going to talk um certainly if you're running into any issues on the discord and you have ideas for things that you think we could do to improve it and by improve it i mean improve the sort of community vibe the inclusive nature what i hope and want for that discord um please definitely like reach out to the moderation team um um yeah so um pratyush roy in the chat is asking um that you're not on discord because you are under 13. when you turn 13 please join absolutely so i believe that the discord this is uh you know out of my hands so to speak um although well um but the the um terms of service or discord are um you have to be 13 or older okay um what am i looking at the chat so what's the deal with these live streams if these are sequence tutorial videos that appear on the coding train why am i here i don't know actually i've kind of lost track of what the whole thing with the coding train is why i'm here oh the uh i was plugged i don't know you tell me why am i here well i would like to engage and connect with the community to some small extent by the way i have a little bit of a problem i've been kind of obsessively on clubhouse which is an audio only on social network i think it's only ios only which is kind of ridiculous but i assume that's just because i haven't had the time to develop it for other platforms yet but i own clubhouse about a half an hour ago now it's at 12 40 p.m eastern i started a room that said precoding train live stream chat because i was up here like plugging in things i thought anybody wants to come in ask a question offer a suggestion for the coding trains live stream maybe they'll uh pop in on clubhouse and say hello nobody joined not one person joined it sat there empty with just me for like five to ten minutes and then i very very sheepishly coward and clicked the leave quietly button i left my own room that i had started and sat in by myself for five minutes ten minutes quietly so anyway if um um um and kobe is um is uh offering some information in the chat about how to join um if you um once you reached a certain birthday okay so um i forgot the other thing so so what do i want to um oh and simon is pointing out that it is invite only ios only audio only yeah so you do need an invite you know if you want an invite i got a lot of invites such a clubhouse invite okay actually if you get a clubhouse invite from me it permanently says forever nominated by daniel schiffman so um that's probably why no enjoy i have invites okay okay okay uh anyway i thought you know i try to do i would like to do some more sort of like q a style stuff obviously i could do that on youtube itself um i could also we have a whole discord which has probably all the capabilities if not more of what clubhouse has but i the reason why i kind of got a little bit addicted to it is um there's a couple podcasts that i listened to that i'm a fan of and they were just having discussion rooms and i was joining them and like really excited and then there were some a lot of you know it's sort of like nft and crypto discussion all the time and i know nothing about that i mean part of me in a very very sort of like crude and uh selfish way sees the nft stuff and just starts to think oh could i sell like you know little like clips of coding train videos as nfts and then i'm like what is wrong with me and my like capitalist urges but um it's sort of interesting to follow at least what's happening in the art world and collecting our digital art in particular and nfcs and i know nothing about it so if you um if you know stuff about that want to come into the tony train discord and educate me i would love to hear all right so as now i think i've answered my own question why am i live streaming just to be here ramble talk engage with the community and work on tutorial adjacent projects um hopefully work on like nonsensical useless projects i actually let me just mention something speaking of clubhouse i wasn't gonna do this but now it's all connected let me go to um i should put this in a github repo so one of the podcasts that i listen to is called um i know you don't know idydk and to be honest i don't listen to every episode because it's about a television show called psych and i haven't watched the show yet and i keep thinking i'll watch it eventually and then listen to the episodes but i um uh the hosts were i have a sort of fun game that they play i guess in the tv show psych let me see if i can find this um you can start to see where i'm going with this um the tv show psych i believe there is a hidden pineapple in every episode and um they have a discussion on the show about uh on the on the podcast about where is the pineapple how pineapplyish is that particular image so i built a system using you know my knowledge i'm trying to use my knowledge of coding and algorithms of machine learning to make a difference in the world people and i thought what else could i possibly do to make a difference than make a pineapple detection web page system for a uh probably a podcast hopefully they're gonna have like a huge they're gonna get the coding train bump now and have thousands of listeners but they're a new podcast i'm assuming it's a small niche group you know i'm a niche this is a niche youtube channel i have all these subscribers but no one really watches the videos it's very interesting to me i mean lots of people do watch the videos don't get me wrong but just um um but uh i forgot what i was talking about anyway so i worked on this i'm gonna show it to you because maybe i can turn this into a github repo and take contributions for it i'll just go to this one which i think is the webcam version of it um you can see that i um did a lot of work with my web my web design skills to build this amazing website um uh are there psych fans i i hear by the way if you're a psych fan you're called a psycho right that's like you know like if you're a fan of is there a name for a coding train fan by the way like i guess you're a passenger no that's that's not i don't know you're a you're a choo choo ian oh and tarantu has just joined tarantu welcome to being you could be the one terence right now you could decide what is the name that fans of the coding train call themselves but i've got to reveal that i'm wearing sweatpants to get my random number book because um i most distinctly by the way i'm quite quite pineappleish if i don't say so myself uh terence your random number please write this down there's absolutely no other way we could ever possibly remember this ever like no computers or databases or anything near us that could possibly keep track of of random numbers assigned to viewers but your random number is on page 209 which is probably the page that i give everybody's random number which is what it opens to um and austin is saying it looks like a late 90s page yes that's the vibe i was going for um uh your random number on page 209 uh line 10 445 35 086 that is your random number so um what i did with this a particular this is a teachable machine trained model a pineapple is actually one of the categories in mobilenet there's 1 000 labels in the mobilenet machine learning image classification model that i use in a lot of coding tutorials and examples but using mobilenet on its own it wasn't really picking up pineapples unless they were you know prominently obviously a pineapple like right in front of the camera so i kind of trained my own model using uh images from um of pineapples as well as screenshots from the television show psych with pineapples placed in them like overlaid i wrote a processing sketch that loads snapshots of psychedel puts pineapples in them made date about i should just be doing this during my livestream it's such a fun project little did you know this is what i'm spending my evenings doing um and uh then took screenshots from the show that didn't have pineapples in them trained a model and now um we can see i know this was one of the things i was using to test fans karn is suggesting that fans of the coding train are unicorns or rainbows that could work um people in the chat i are saying please say my name and i really appreciate your enthusiasm and desire and i don't mind just like every once in a while reading one of them or maybe i shouldn't even say that but i would like to discourage people from asking that a chat sort of fills up the chat with a lot of extraneous messages and i will pull out and reference so you're more likely to have me say your name if i if you post a uh a wonderful little quip or suggestion or chat message there so let's try i know that it really like basically learned that yellow the pineapples are yellow you can see that i've made a yellow detector um i wonder if i just like take my hat off um how you know i've got a mushroom here oh come on can you hear that this is my new sound effect um yeah so anyway um i don't know that i should um do this right now maybe one of the um coding trade mods or github managers people i'm like making up titles for people but if you have access to make a new coding train repo i'll put this sketch into and actually the one the one that i probably should start with is not the webcam one this is meant to be used although there's no reason why i couldn't have it do both um pineapple uh pineapple detection system this is it yeah this is the one where you can drag and drop an image so if i were to look for an image let's actually look for a screenshot from psych um like uh let's use this this is this is this is definitely that um i'm using my time my live stream very wisely here we're gonna get to all sorts of productive important projects let's just uh let's let's confirm which i put on the desktop yeah let's drag this image in and we've got yes see no pineapple in that image now if i were to take that image and i were to then oh that's such a small little image and then i were to look for a pineapple and like paste it in and make it small like he's got pineapples on his shirt now okay i'm saving this let's see how this changes it let's see if my model works the way i expect point two two percent pineapple there we go 62 pineapple this is how i've been spending my time the thing is though i think i don't know how this is where i ended up in my life but i do get paid to teach actual college courses on this stuff and i i was working on this for the most part as a way to um um then i hope that this will be an example for my course in the fall it'll be fun you know the students will enjoy it they'll think i'm their really cool professor teacher person thing all right enough about pineapple ai please uh you just go to twitter twitter uh hashtag pioneer oh it's i forgot to say it's not pineapple ai it's um like if i go to twitter and go to uh hashtag uh pine a i pull its name is pineapple and i really actually just want to make a twitter bot that you can oh there we go good work everybody let's just show your please hold all right i broke my own rule which is not to be logged into my actual twitter account on a live stream but that's okay everything's okay uh you know it's just another day where nazi is trending on twitter thank you very much never opening up that trash website again oh my god all right back to back to today so let me actually try to um get um a little bit of a coding rail fan a rail fan is a fan of a train says arnov and profimesh is pointing out that my um green screen is 99 playable oh and david is a big fan of psych so david please oh yeah you can participate in this with me excellent uh the worlds can collide the uh weird entertainment podcasting world that i like to just listen in on from time to time um i have a whole other ai project that actually has quite uh not a large audience but a slightly larger audience than the pineapple ai that i'll bring to the coding train someday is there anybody here still watching no good we're we're uh this is a uh oh my goodness and guess who forgot to uh say thank you uh today's sponsor um brilliant uh brilliant is a wonderful a website where if you would like to learn in an interactive way everything you need to make a pineapple ai you actually could because they have a whole set of interactive courses that are stepbystep um quizzes and learning modules um that you can learn a whole variety of topics almost all of which are connected to things that they do here on the coding drain math and science and physics and coding and geometry and ai you can go to brilliant.org codingtrain you can actually sign up for free just signing up for free from that link shows them that you found it from me but if you want to unlock everything all the courses and everything at brilliant uh the first 200 subscribers will get 20 off so i'll come and i'm going to look at a course that i'm doing right now the course that i'm going through is one of the geometry ones and i'll come back and look at that a little bit more later um all right all right so one the one the first thing on my list today and this can be this is which is really important and maybe what i will do is just go to my rainbow topics um is that i have uh traditionally for however many years now maybe two or three um made a video a coding challenge for pi day and some of these maybe i've already done some of them maybe i didn't but i sort of i've kind of exhausted a lot of the things that i know about that kind of maybe would make sense for pi day um and it's also it comes at a bad time for me because ultimately you know if we're like pi day were in june although i guess i could do tau day and then i wasn't teaching and i had more time to like work on sort of speculative other topic videos but i don't want to let it go without a video this year and it there could be something actually quite relevant to um that comes out of like some of these recent videos that i've been doing about polar coordinates and simple harmonic motion and all that stuff but here i am it is just time for me to um and pratyush is saying that pineapple is my favorite fruit i actually don't really like refined up all that much let's see if anybody can guess my favorite fruit i'm not sure i really know what my favorite fruit is but if if we go back to the fruit that i used to always eat as a child there's a there's a famous story in my family i famously refused to eat at fast food restaurants was a child and uh um ate a bag of plums oh i just gave it away but i hate a bag of plums instead of the like and my family did not go to fast food restaurants very often but it was like on some sort of trip or something and everybody got horrible food poisoning and sick but not me because i only ate the plums um mango is a good one and also love the blueberry oh the blueberry is a wonderful fruit but yeah now you've all guessed plums because i already said although i don't know maybe um oh and austin tal day austin i haven't seen you in a while uh welcome back austin or maybe you've been around all this time and i just haven't noticed your name recently all right um so i need some ideas for pi day so this is a i don't i don't know how well this is going to work but um put them in the chat i'm going to um let's look for things that i've done already pi day coding train if i do this um so i did oh i did a version of a video based on three blue one browns um three blue one browns um video about the clacking what else to call it right now sorry i'm seeing a chat mask how about calculating pi the archimedean way one polygon touching a circle from inside another from the outside and the average length approaches the real circumference as they get more edges interesting i like this idea i did the first pi day challenge that i did was this one which is approximating um the value of pi with the dart throwing method what is the i'm not gonna be able to say this and i i do know this is just like not i mean i'm i'm familiar with this um it's just not fresh in my memory and i'm sure i spelled it archimedes way um finding pi by archimedes method official website approximating pi all right let's look at this you know what guess what everybody 13w net new york is my local station thank you very much not that i have any way of watching it but it is my local station okay around 250 bc up i have to sneeze okay please hold yes i am a very professional youtube host here who just shuts everything off to sneeze i had a box of kleenex the other day right here on the desk i don't know where it is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter well that's the definition of pi um so could i launch an interactive all right let's see what that is ah oh the um uh simon is pointing out the factors in common the chant and that i i know that um it was a long sneeze indeed i know why this interactive is not working so there i know what a channel that i'm a huge a fan of is stand up maths uh pi calculate dice rolling i mean i don't know if this is yep from a thousand random numbers this is what i'm thinking of here hi i'm matt parker and for pi day this year i am going to generate 1 000 random numbers using these two dice the first two of which are 31 and 27 so 31 and 27 do not share a factor in common well they share one the most pointless of all the factors but we're ignoring that right so we say they are this could be good because i need one of the projects that i have on my list today is to digitize and i don't actually have to do this because it already exists but i want to digitize the sequence of random numbers that are in this book so that i can always use it as my random number generator so that i could certainly do and then i would have to write some code that calculates the factors of every number and then determines if they are the same i guess i could like experiment with this right now so one of the things that i can do with my live streams is sort of um tinker around with an idea i got a haircut you can't tell i'm just wearing this hat but all of a sudden like there's like hair all over me um it's probably dog hair from gloria but um what i could do is uh um you know how do i what's an algorithm algorithm for determining the factors of a number uh so like stack overflow will tell us oh and um abe is pointing out that there's a new video that just came out from matt parker which is pi y pi to the pi to the pi to the pi could be an integer huh um it is not random if you get it from a repeatable source yes but there's a million of them i don't i could do i could calculate pi with all one million approximately pi with all one million numbers i love this idea so this is interesting but simon is telling me to check out euclid's algorithm is an efficient method for um computing the greatest common divisor of two integers the largest number that divides them both without a remainder okay this is excellent is an example of an algorithm which is a stepbystep procedure for performing a calculation according to welldefined rules this is one of the oldest okay i'm loving this idea so far so if i were to summarize this what am i not logged in okay hold on what what is going on give me a second here um oh i don't know there's a lot of stuff going on in clubhouse right now i might need to just turn this off and go listen to some interesting discussions um please hold oh my god what kind of crazy password is this sure why not whatever don't do anything you tell me to do all right i am back uh in the coding train topics repo and let's make a um by the way i find i find github's dark mode to be a little bit too dark for my taste i don't know why but i feel like i can't read the text um so uh all right yes um now uh pi day 20 21 uh euclids are like cofactors random numbers use all one million random numbers so 500 000 pairs um calculate the um is this what i'm looking for the greatest common divisor this is good actually this is one of the things i've been helping my kids with in their math class they're learning about how to reduce um fractions to their simplest form um and then so this is a good reference um ah where did i go ah no i closed it i'm the worst okay come on local storage thank you okay and now um this is a very mathy um i'd have to think about what what visuals might go with this but um um what visuals could go with this but and i'm not saying i'm definitely going to do this but here is an idea so if you can actually right now first of all you can reply to this thread if you have some suggestions or comments on this one if i've gotten this sort of wrong but you can right now file any issues here you won't be able to add the pi day label but i or another codingtrain github.org member will be able to do so i'm going to collect um lists of things and probably if pi day is march i need to record this video like next week so get them in get your suggestions in i would say buy monday if you can um all right um let's see anybody else got anything um that you want to share as an idea for pi day before i move on and one of the others like pie art looks like the art in pie yeah i mean i've done videos like this i'm not video i've done examples like this this is really nice i had this idea of graphing the um the distribution of random numbers of numbers in pi to see like if i do the first million like how evenly distributed is it these are lovely um i like seeing these um great work whoever made this visual cinnamon um a pie based rose yeah i mean i've made videos about the lisa's you curve and rose curves and all of these would be great to do i mean i could also do a coding challenge on a topic like this would likely i'd like like i want to do one that i haven't done before that just makes use of um polar coordinates or trigonometry and the number pi in some way that is like a celebration of pi day but not really like dealing with the number pi or its sequence of digits itself that's also something i'm crashing thunder is saying i like the idea of finding sequences or interesting information in the digits but guess what that's what i did last year so uh peaking inside pi coding train i'm pretty sure that was the video um that i did last year um right around the time of the start of the global pandemic uh march 14th 2020 and this was based on i assume it'll be linked from this page um this was based on the fathom uh fathom information designs project peek inside pie so i highly recommend that you check this out by the way i should be doing a better job of this but links that i'm looking at in the live stream i try to post those to the coding train discord under the live category under links so for example here's one that i'm just sharing and here's one that i'm just sharing so if you want to pick up these links um you know this is this youtube video that i just shared um um you can uh grab them there but more importantly boy did i forget to share the link to my pineai apple pineapple what if you use the sequences to make the rows more intricate so i could do a like a followup video that elaborates on the the rose curve um and makes some interesting variations of it i'm definitely i'm open to that idea oops i forgot that i don't have this disstream chat oh use the pendulum simulation so simon is saying um oh i don't have this here anyway okay sorry i messed this up bear with me for a second clearing out a chat thing use the pendulum simulation to calculate pi the formula for the period of a pendulum includes pi i think there might be um some issues with that in terms of how what my pendulum simulation actually does what if i could get i have an idea what if i could get a physical pendulum use computer vision to track the pendulums the bob of the pendulum's location and read its period based on millies and its physical location from the camera and then calculate pi that way that's a pretty interesting idea i would even try that right now if i because i have a bunch of cameras and things but i don't think i have a pendulum anywhere i suppose i could rig one up um but i like this idea oh ash okay ash hello hold on a second ash writes i'm learning coding on white hat jr i'm very curious one of the things that um uh i happen to look at from time to time is uh links that peop referral links to like the p5.js website and other kind of creative coding websites that i'm involved with um and um white hat jr is just like a uh uh site that i don't know if it's a massive site but it just throws a lot of traffic to p5.js or editor.pp5 the p5 web editor so i'm curious for anyone who's i don't know i'm not familiar with what white house jr is um but i'm curious for anybody who's a user of it to kind of let me know a little bit about it all right and uh simon is telling me that a i don't know why this is not working but i'm not going to worry about it that a 2.45 meter long pendulum will take pi seconds to complete a cycle so maybe i could measure exactly that length why i have like a nervous tic which is when i record videos or live stream i start to like sneeze or my nose gets itchy it's really like it's very strange remember that's a thing that happens to other people or it's just me all right i would like to share uh where we timewise 1 40 p.m i would like to share some projects from you the community of viewers of the code of dream that you have made that you have put your heart and soul into or at least a little bit of time into you took the time to watch your video play with the code make your own version so submit it to the codygrade website and i want to say thank you to you i love to see these and use them for inspiration and share them with students and all sorts of content so let's move on over to codytraining.com i'm gonna go to the challenger page um and i would like to so i have two methods by which that i look at community contributions one is i spin a wheel to pick a random one i have a just a random number generatory thingy that will pick a random one but i often also like to just look at because there's not that many of them uh community contributions to recent coding challenges so lucky for you if you so feel so inclined if you recently submitted a project to the spring force or the um and thank you for that comment prathamesh that you're sharing with me now that's good for me to know i was not aware the music was quite loud see i knew the music was too loud but i guess it's just different tracks of different volume but let me turn that back down now sorry everybody too loud too loud too loud yeah sorry about that um okay okay okay i got it i got it why is that why is it that that song is so loud hold on it's gonna be really quiet for a second try this again weird now it's like gone yeah okay i just wonder if i can can i do um q volume 50 percent all right so now so this is at the correct volume and now hopefully please mind your ears i have set that other track to 50 volume so it should be fine but there's a small chance i didn't do it correctly it's gonna be too loud here we go hopefully this is good all right sorry about that everybody all right let's look at um let's go to the pendulum first and let's take a look at some of these projects that people have submitted oh yeah this is great i'm so excited so i haven't seen all of these some of these will be new but some of them i have looked at already and i did look at this pendulum on a cart um project so this is super interesting to me because this is a simulation of the sort of pendulum flipped upside down and balanced on a cart and i forget if i can um oh yeah and it's i guess it's an algorithm for the cart to actually like balance itself but this is something that would be roger saying better yet no sound sorry i i have to have the sound it keeps me alive and full of energy it makes me feel like i'm not just alone in an attic in brooklyn new york talking to myself which is in many ways what i'm doing it's a little weird um what i was saying was um i've been looking for some examples for reinforcement style learning and so the sort of like cart balancing a poll type style example um is quite a good one and so maybe there's something i could do with this i have to admit i don't know too much about this particular algorithm it's pid controller um so i don't um like pid cart is a controller i don't know this terminology um but uh proportional integral derivative controller is a control loop mechanism employing feedback ah interesting i would love to explore this in a future video this would be i would love to be able to figure this out myself but not going to happen right now thank you for that wonderful contribution moving on i'm going to go to the colorful pendulum in codepen by andreyud chaka chakraborty there we go i love this we've got some nice um trails going a nice little beautiful red color picked for the pendulum um it'd be interesting to sort of time it and see if we could approximate the number of pi the number pi through this swinging pendulum um one thing that i was going to suggest for people for an exercise i think i might have forgotten to in the video is can you make it so that you can catch the pendulum and drag it around and then let it go um actually the nature of code example does have that code built into it that's something you might consider thank you i don't know why i have to press this thing twice every time why i don't think it's working correctly i was using it to replace this but thank you for this wonderful pendulum simulation okay next simple pendulum simulation using python and we've got a nice youtube video that is showing us the results here uh awesome this looks like that this particular simulation is using some real world measurements to simulate the path the oscillation of a pendulum in python i wonder if there is a code source code is linked here so we can see that here um on um on github itself cool whoa all right awesome um i'm not gonna go through this in a lot of detail right now but it's fun to see okay um next up we have got the up down left right by josh kenzer and this was by karen canary walla by the way the previous one up down left right whoa i have not seen this one yet um so one thing i should probably do this is a little bit unfortunate one thing that the um web editor doesn't do very smartly and i don't know the best way to handle it is if um if the editor is set to high contrast mode but the default sort of like text style is um black so it's very hard to read it let me just do show boxes so that says show boxes and show pendulum which is useful for me to just read out what it says anyway so i guess show pendulums is actually show the lines this is really this is this has the makings of a really nice perfect looping gif um i think there's that that i would really encourage you to think about as a way then you can nft it i don't know is that the thing i don't know how it works um i shouldn't just be so cavalier with my commentary um but uh you know bees and bombs is a um an artist that i'm a huge fan of who makes um among many other artists do this as well but makes uh um looping gifs out of uh simple and sometimes quite complex algorithms like this one but really nice choice of color and behavior in the way the pendulums all synchronize and meet up and create this geometric order and then separate out i love this quite a bit what does the slider do guess it's maybe like the speed or like a force oh or it's like some kind of alpha yeah oh the slider is the alpha yeah interesting that's pretty wild just to zoom in on this for a second that's quite beautiful the smearing of the color all right um bot bit just asked can you do gjk algo and run cutter which i'm probably saying incorrectly sometime i would i do want to explore those someday um i always just use sort of like simple euler integration which is a sort of fancy term for the way that i model motion in like p5.js animation programs and all the nature of code examples but i would like to explore some more sophisticated versions um okay now we've got a pendulum website by sarvogya singh what was that i love this little animation there's a little pendulum there my pendulums a simple pendulum a newton's cradle and a double pendulum oh this is so cool uh use arrow keys to make it move do i click on each of these oh and we get oh so i can like i can like apply a force to it with the arrow key that's pretty cool i love that i love that now let's look at the newton's cradle i would love this would be a great um this would be a lovely um coding challenge video uh see i feel like i want to like click and drag these press arrow key to start oh up whoa these are like little springy ones that's cool oh my god what have i done ah this is wild is this using um like a like a physics engine like mater.js or is this all yeah it's using matter.js so a matter.js is a physics engine that i use in in different examples of it previously but i haven't in a while this is great uh okay um let's look at the double pendulum just curious if this is a double pendulum also with matter.js can i click or is this just more um oops based on yeah this is also with mata.js cool wonderful thank you for sharing this okay now i know after that twice this is also way too quiet if i put it by the mic you can really hear it uh let us go now to um spring forces and see what we've got we've got three contributions here and i know that there have been other things that people have made i really would love for you to um submit them here because it's hard for me to pull up stuff from discord or twitter or whatever so i love for you to share your things that you make with me through other platforms but this is the central location to collect everything that i might look at on a given live stream okay grab any spring particle by galaton cool oh can i this is very similar visually at least to the example oh but i can grab any part of it oh that's wild so that's the change like i can just grab over here very springy so definitely some of the things i need to i should probably work on with my particular implementation is keeping things a little bit more um a little less chaotic uh all right thank you for that spring force contribution grasp by leonardo this one i have not seen oh cool so this looks like what it must be is it's just like my oh this is so oh oh this is really awesome so i'm just totally speculating here but i think what's being done here is this is literally my connected spring example it might not be but um um and so if you think about that soft string hanging down and you flipped it so that maybe this sort of like pseudogravity force is pointing upwards and then maybe there's like some forces some pearl and noise like forces pushing it left and right arbitrarily or just moving the top manually and all the sort of like springy connections are undulating and squiggling around and then even though this might be a sort of you know visualized in the literal way as like circle line circle line by having these strokes of of uh sequentially smaller widths um you really get this like seaweed underwater grass plant form like quality oh and abe is asking will you also take a look at the contributions of the noc series i actually wasn't planning that because i was thinking i'm sort of focused on just looking at the last two videos but um sure i would love to check out um particularly abbe if there was one of yours that you recently submitted that you want me to take a look at i would certainly or anybody else who's watching the chat that's submitted to those videos um please let me know i'm i almost don't want to look at the code because it's just so um beautiful on its own without even unpacking what's below it but i i can't resist so the grass looks like this is like what i did um with a very low k that seems to be something different um there's also a wind force which is new let's see and the wind is just a random amount every time that's interesting so because if the wind is small enough and it's random every time it's not going to like go crazy like this because it's just a little push in one way or the other so you randomly get a few pushes in one direction it'll start to go that way and it might slow back go back that's great um applying the force wind and this looks and i i think the secret here is just really thoughtful rendering um i don't know where that happens really thoughtful rendering and just clever tuning of the values and adding the wind obviously so let's look for where is the rendering happening i'm just curious uh grass update particle update spring show so that's in the show function of the spring and it has a stroke weight that stroke weight changes and is passed in during the loop ah this is such a very clever way of doing this so like this dot total minus i so if this if there's 10 springs the first one is thickness ten then nine then eight and seven etcetera etcetera um okay so simon has shared something for me to click on that um it was a collaboration between him and abe let me grab that real quick um and come back to it are we at break time yet yeah we're just about break time i gotta uh come i'm gonna take a break in a minute here whoa oh this is good it's like what kind of crazy insane code did you all write and i realized oh this is just the open simplex noise implementation okay let's run this lovely lovely lovely so we've got oscillating particles changes in colors actually something that i want to if if you'll end all indulge me for a second i want to explore something this reminds me of um so thank you for creating this um uh wonderful sketch i like how you're using a javascript object for like settings that's kind of like a cool little trick and i could also imagine you loading those from like a json file or something which you've got like a configuration for any particular visualization um but what i actually i if you'll all indulge me for a second i want to look at the video tutorial that i recorded on friday was about how to use an image texture in p5.js with a particle system to create a flame like effect and it was my expectation and let me do a dupe let me duplicate this and when i was trying to do this when i was recording the video itself that if i were to type webgl and use the webgl renderer i would see exactly the same thing would see exactly the same thing but maybe i would be able to get higher performance out of it even though this is a 2d system just to use the hardware acceleration of the webgl implementation in the browser itself when i ran this i see nothing and i see no error so i wanted to try to figure this out so let me just see i'm just gonna um comment out everything like where is the bug so first let me just draw that image yes so there's the image um and if i do sorry if i do background zero there that's the image now if i change this to webgl and i think i just figured out oh it's oh well that's a big issue oh that's all it is actually oh my goodness i'm such a let's say dumdum but this is i'm not because this is the mistake we all make and forget and do i forgot that the um point of origin in web gel renderer is the center so what if i just like do something which is probably not the best idea but just oh like hold on do this move it back okay great there we go so now i think oh is this i could have included this in the video maybe i will add an addendum to it um let's just see if this now works yeah but why am i not seeing the at the additive blending so why is blend mode ad in webgl i must need something different huh oh but this is good because this ran super super slow and let me just go for a second to the particle and just put the tint back to 255 just for a second so this is a smoky like effect and if i go back to the sketch um i'm getting some look at this later um if i go back to the sketch let me take out blend mode add okay so this ran really really slow so let me take out webgl it still looks kind of different so strange um um and let me i'm sorry i'm thinking here i'm also getting messages by reading direct messages on another platform so apologies for that um okay let's put back webgl no no this is what i want to do if i go and just comment this up what i wanted to look at is if i change emit to five you can see the frame rate here is now quite slow it's running quite slow oh the issue is maybe the clear okay i'll i'll investigate that i needed clear in with the additive blending not in webgl but that could be an issue so what i first thing i want to test is just if i add webgl here yeah so this is awesome super fast okay the webgl render is super fast now uh let me get oh i have the background on let's oh yeah are the clear on no that shouldn't matter uh hold on you know i want background let me take out clear for a second same thing now i'm in webgl you know why is it i think there's a z a layering issue also that the transparency that i have to consider yeah so this this i this i need to figure out like why i've got great performance but what's wrong with um what's wrong with the blending and i suppose a google search is probably not gonna uh 3d okay oh wait subtract so blend mode supposedly okay oh most of these only work no but these say 2d add should work with webgl according to the reference another thing to just make sure is that i am using yeah i'm using the newish version of p5 so i'm gonna have to investigate this more later i wanted to see if there was like a quick way that i could figure this out because i love the performance that i'm getting out of this now um add only works for 2d really all right let's try one of the ones that specifically says 3d uh like subtract so let's add let's try subtract well if i'm subtracting not getting anything is the issue there we go interesting oh hold on i think i have an idea oh look at that that's kind of cool if i'm subtracting i can do it that way and then do i and i don't even need the clear clear doesn't do anything does it so that's pretty interesting could i invert this now like watch could i use filter inverse or invert i don't know that that works in webgl no it cannot uh that's crazy fascinating so how why why why why is add i mean ad should really work so let me see uh webgl additive blending no i want really just the web gel so i wonder if i can like sort of break into the lower level webgl code and i would say this is a bug probably in um p5 yeah this to me feels like a bug but i'm glad to see this because this is pretty interesting to me now if i were to i think i can get some color out of this by going into the particle there we go kind of like that oh i forgot it's it's the opposite if i'm subtracting it's kind of interesting um well i'm pleased to see that i've gotten somewhere with this i think i should try to do uh investigate this further to see if there's actually a bug in p5 itself to me it feels like there is because how could how could add i mean broadly speaking forget about what p5 has chosen to implement or not um but broadly speaking um if you could do a kind of subtract blend in the web in in native webgl in the browser then there's no reason why the an ad blend wouldn't be possible and additive blending is also one of the most common techniques um in computer graphics in terms of creating fiery glowylike effects that i have a feeling this is um an error um austin is telling me to try screen okay and i'll have to change the background then to zero oh look at that screen interesting what is screen so now are you telling me that uh uh what i'm losing i've lost the alpha though or is it just that my numbers are so high or do i need the clear no i have clear the clear shouldn't really matter so why am i not getting like it's at the fade why am i not getting the this i wonder if i should actually use the texture um a 1 minus a times b this is pretty interesting though to see i mean this is kind of a nice effect also but it's not exactly what i'm looking for um oh profit mesh is asking about the live captions yes so i did an experiment where i was getting the live captions from a different service last week and i really liked it and i've been working on trying to get that directly into obs and i wasn't able to get it to work yet um so for today i'm just using the unfortunately the automated live captions from youtube those should be enabled um but um and if if um anybody's interested in helping me with getting um sort of the ape some sort of api working between i would love to connect offline about that because i would like to be able to get a better captioning service um enable alpha for the renderer yeah that is often true um okay all right i'm gonna move on from this because um i only have till three o'clock and i do wanna get to some other things that i want to do today i also need to take a minute to tell you about today's sponsor can i do a drum roll for the sponsor well i'm pressing buttons and getting things set up brilliant all right what is brilliant this is brilliant and maybe i'm going to take away this for a second this is the brilliant website it is a website i would say what i want to show you it's a website wow isn't that like such a brilliant characterization it's a website which is full of learning potential and possibilities if you like the content that i do on the coding train algorithms visualizations math physics the number pi geometry infinity ai and neural networks programming if you like all that stuff i think you might i think you would enjoy um uh brilliant brilliant is uh and the thing that i'm really trying to do with brilliant which is new is i'm trying to think of it as something that i can build into my daily or more likely here for me the way my life works weekly routine so i've set a goal for myself to try to do a lesson from a course one lesson every week let me just pull up here i want to make sure i had some other notes of things that i wanted to sort of say um say about brilliant just to make sure that i'm hitting all the um important points um you know i think for me one of the things that i as a teacher i'm really trying to find ways to inspire the love of learning and the fun of learning and so you know sometimes sort of often traditional ways of learning through kind of tests and memorization um don't can really um they're really kind of a downer in terms of getting that love of learning and so for me um making video tutorials playing around engaging with the community is one way and also having uh going through interactive lessons which have forms and discussions uh and lots of clever fun uh visual ways of and written ways of learning things that's really been uh really increased this sort of like fun and the other thing is there's a lot of topics here that i don't explore um cryptocurrency is one quantum computing is another so there's if you want to join me and a community of eight million learners and educators today um all you have to do is go to brilliant.org codingtrain um you can sign up for free just through that um but you also to unlock everything on the website um the first 200 subscribers uh to do so through that link will get 20 off so the course that i was doing um i don't know why it's not showing up to me here immediately i think i was was it beautiful geometry continue course yeah this is the one that i've been working on i think i'm on lesson two yeah so i'm on lesson two i've done lesson one already and my goal hopefully if you see me next week check with me am i on to lesson four do you guys hear that car alarm going off by the way that's always a lovely thing to happen why welcome to new york city people um so let's see i'm gonna like work through some of these problems the other thing about this to be perfectly honest for me one of the things i like about brilliant is i get lots of ideas for coding tutorials that i want to make um all right so what fraction of this large square has been shaded red okay well i can say that it's more than a quarter right because this is a quarter right here so this is oneeighth so a quarter plus an eighth plus a sixteenth so this is some kind of sequence that i guess when it goes to infinity going to infinity add in add infinitive is latin meaning to infinity it's approaching what and so these lessons here um simon is telling us an avid brilliant user i know is telling me that these lessons are called quizzes thank you um so what is this approach um and i guess i could just like use p5 first i could use a calculator but if i were to say like in p5 for a second um like if i were to say like 4 let i equal 0 i is less than like 100 i plus plus i'm going to start with the sum which is 0.25 sum plus plus equal itself uh divided by two right divided by four oh that wasn't oneeighth yeah it is no no times two oh i'm sorry if that's one let me look back at this this is 1 4 that's 1 16 1 16 that is not 1 8 that's 1 16 because it's 1 fourth of onefourth onesixteenth so that was right i said that wrong sum uh divided by four and console log if i do that a hundred times what do i get and oh no i don't want to add the whole okay hold on some okay i need a start is i don't think i'm gonna get through this whole lesson today oh and you can't see my code oh i'm the worst um sorry about that everybody let me move this over good thing it was it's okay my code was like terrible anyway because it wasn't right so what i'm doing is i have a sum i'm starting with zero sum plus equal and i'm just going to say value sum plus equal that value then value times equals a quarter and then keep adding it together and together together let's just do that 100 times so stand in for infinity aha point three three three three three three one third i don't have the chat open anymore so people were probably yelling at me yeah onethird plus onefourth to the power of number and range this is a geometric series okay um austin's right on every scale the red square is onethird of the blue squares that's um okay that's actually a great way of thinking about it that totally makes sense um so let me go back to the brilliant website i'm gonna confidently click one third i'm gonna hit submit i got this right 52 by the way i want to let you know that i get this stuff wrong i don't know what i was gonna say at least a quarter of the time if not more and so to me uh the and i also love the feedback it gives me when i get it wrong because um it's like very positive and affirming and i think like that's part of the learning process is getting it wrong and then i always every time i click on these explanations because i like to see what it says the figure can be thought of as a series of progressively smaller up and down l shapes each one with a dimension half of that of the previous one each individual shape has one red square and two blue squares for a total of three squares so the red makes up one third of each l shape so that would have been a that's an austin in the chat said that that would have been a great way um to think about it for e day next year says braden you should calculate e what day would e day be february something um i wish i could say that it hadn't been several years since i touched a geometric series so this could be actually an approach that i take a geometric series to cut i think oh i did this one i did the geometric series for calculating pi which what was that one called um liebnet's formula yeah i did that on the coding train coding train so this is one i did another year the leibniz formula is a method for approximating pi so um wonderful all right and austin just saw it intuitively which is always great to hear okay i i would like to uh so i'm gonna um you know keep me honest here folks tweet at me message me at the discord let me know did i finish my lesson two later today i'm gonna go through and finish this on my own my goal i'm trying to have a goal of doing one more lesson per week i feel like if i can get through all the courses on brilliant by doing one one lesson or one quiz per week that i'll have had a lot of new ideas and things to be teaching and doing on the coding train um just to mention a couple other courses um if you want to learn python there's a whole course programming with python which is an interactive code editor that's one that i've spent some time with that's really terrific and then a good companion piece to the coding train um is also this neural networks and ai oh just this this course about neural networks on the brilliant website so thank you so much to brilliant for sponsoring these live streams really helps keep the the um the engines running here on the coding train um i really do appreciate it i'm gonna take a short break and if you haven't signed up for brilliant during this break i would highly encourage you to head to brilliant.org codingtrain and i will be back in hopefully less than five minutes do just want to briefly drop in to acknowledge the message from whooshbot thank you so much i happen to be taking a break but i see your wonderful a kind message and the enthusiasm of viewers like you is really what keeps me going so thank you so much do do do do do all right coming back in just a few minutes uh i'm not a few minutes sorry just like 30 seconds sorry do all right you know it really requires a lot of energy to come to these but i'm enjoying this i had a lot of energy at the start and i'm starting to fade but i do have some a sort of like and i feel like i also feel like in a way this is like what i want the live streams to be which is just a hangout session um i think maybe it's actually a little less appealing to some of the audience who would much rather just see me like working on like building tetris basically in a twohour live stream which that kind of thing gets requested a lot and i do aspire to do it actually tetris and funny to mention that is something that i really have high on my list now of um i don't know if that should be like a multipart coding series or just something i do in the live stream but um i don't know so your feedback is welcome how to make you know my focus right now is really on the tutorial videos that i'm doing um and then i think i will pivot hopefully come around um april or may um to being able to do some other content but um if you have sort of thoughts or feedback about what uh what you like about the videos i release versus the live streams and how to um you know um how it's all feeling for you um it'd be great to hear i mean it's interesting i have finally now separated the live streams from the produced sequence tutorials and coding challenge videos so before it was all the same thing where i would my live stream was really just a live stream of my recording session now i do those recording sessions i still do actually stream those for members to sort of like tune into to like help give me feedback but they're much more of like actual recording session with no community segments um and um jodhwat says plan the comment i see in the chat is a plan and yeah so i'm often wondering do i need more of a plan so anyway your feedback is welcome i'm not gonna be doing that much live streaming to be perfectly honest in the next couple months um there's gonna be two more hopefully in march one or two more in march one will be with a guest um and then and then i'm just taking a few weeks off and alex subscribe to brilliant that's so nice glad to hear all right um i've lost the live the coding train member chat there it is i've got it back um is this the end already guess what it's not i'm off to do one more thing and i had a kind of longer list of but oh just as a reminder if you have um ideas for and thank you to brilliant for the sponsorship um if you have ideas for pi day videos please post those in discord or in the github repo someone can maybe share that um the night sky writes longer beard should make the audience focus better interesting interesting there's there by the way there's like a period of time somewhere in the sort of like um you know beginning of quarantine we're still really in quarantine here um where my beard had gotten i never have gotten that long i saw a i saw like an image of me from one of those live streams and i was like shocked because it didn't seem that crazy to me at the time but like whoa it had gotten really crazy um all right so here's the thing that i need to do i need is some sort of interesting word choice of mine there i mean i i don't know really why i need to do this but um i'm going to go here so all you you know if you've been a coding trained viewer for a while or even recently for a short while that i have an obsession with this book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal normal deviates i'm still looking for an original print of this book that is fully intact with every page it will be my prized possession if i can ever track down a copy um um but um anyway i have this version and i and i'm i'm working on this project where i'm laser etching and i really should bring the strain whistle that has the actual test laser etch on it laser etching a random walk pattern onto train whistles and sending them as gifts to members of the coding train um and i don't know austin is that question for me because definitely doing more server side stuff recently and i often get the feedback people like why are you doing all this database and blah blah blah stuff um um so i'm reading the chat the same time while i'm talking so i think for the authenticity the total and pure beautiful authenticity of these train whistles and for other things that i want to do like perhaps this pi day video i would like to have access to the random number sequence of 100 million digits that is in this book in a i don't know what what i should put in a json file a text file a binary file i'll make a whole web api i'm not sure but so but let me download some of these data file well this is actually all i want i spent a lot of time talking about this oh only to reveal that here it is exactly what i need the 1 million the table of random digits in plain form so what's in these other ones this is in pdf anyway i'm just going to download this one let us open it up let me open it in um just put it on the desktop here and go to terminal what's it called digits.txt and there we go oh interesting this is actually in the file so i'm gonna have to do some parsing of this so the other thing about this right now i remember why i want to do this because i ultimately i have space by the way for one million that'll be i don't know what i'm going to do if i ever have one million people join as a member of the coding train but they're one million spots basically right i would like to produce all one million of these terrain whistles eventually oh oh that could be kind of awesome okay what if like everyone was unique okay this is cool this is cool okay totally i love this i love this okay so first things first let's just do an exploratory session for a moment where um i am going to load this into the discord bot that i've been working on like ultimately in some sense i want to make this a separate project like the random number sequence api project or member coding train member database project but let's wrap it into the discord bot for a second so i'm going to go to very convenient and i know that i said i was going to look at the live poll today sorry about that i'm the worst um i'm the worst okay so i'm in the image generation i can't remember where i left this off maybe somebody can remember discord bot choo choo um all right did i merge this branch pull request oh oh i've had some oh this is the image generation so why didn't i merge this i don't know i see no reason not to i'm about working this branch a little bit longer so i'm sort of remember i'm gonna go to glitch for a second where i actually have the bot and my very very clever and super amazing way of disabling the bot is to comment out the code so this is the actual deployment of choo choo bot which is running on glitch i should probably i love glitch and i think it makes sense for a lot of things that i do but maybe the discord bot actually should be deployed somewhere else um so now if i let's just see if i'm in the right place here um if i run it what oh i forgot i was trying to i forgot that i was in a speculative place oh right and fun planet showed me how to do this i never follow up on this stuff i'm the worst i gotta get to the summer where i don't have like other work i have to do all week in between live streams and i can like follow up and remember what i've done so hold on hold on everybody uh let me let me open up this pro i'm gonna get there if you will just be patient with me um i'm going to go to generate.js and remove require p5 which is all i need to do i think actually i think i just left that in there there we go great so now i think if i go to um discord is this only i don't did i remove the idea of it running only in one channel um so where's my commands.js no but let me take that out um so i'm just going to use my a channel where only i have permission in i think we'll see if this works so i'm going to discord and i'm just going to use this channel like if i do this command i don't have the permissions all right can somebody please oh fun planet there you are you're watching oh fun planet thank you so much for all of those i really like fallen was so excited about that i was like i want to make actually and i would love to collaborate on this or if you just want to like go for it i will really support and champion you but i wanted to make a lot node library that was not that was like a node p5 library that allowed you to do p5 in node but didn't actually have um well either had that didn't have i don't know how to best do this i didn't want to like change the p5 code itself i want this to be a wrapper of some additional code so that as the p5 library grows and changes over time it can always just stay in sync with it but we're not um so that's that's kind of my my plan so um did i vamp long enough is there somebody who's a mod here um who can um who can fix the um and maybe i'll just do it myself i'm going to try to fix the permissions of the bot testing channel um so how do i do that um channel edit channel permissions advanced permissions is what i want um everyone see i don't know how to do this quickly i'm gonna make everyone not be able to send messages i think this is fine i think that might have been enough somebody can hopefully fix it for me but i'm back so i'm in this channel which should have the bot going and that was running right from here uh did i call it generate was it random walk oh yeah there we go great i don't see any console logging happens which makes me nervous like like i don't i seriously don't have like a console log uh it's just okay okay great i'm in the right code my bot is running so this is what i sorry for that i've got i've got 20 minutes here to do um uh to do about what i want to do so i'm going to take this file digits.dxt txt i am going to put it into uh discord bot choo choo commands um the question is where to store it let's just store it here in the root directory for right now is this by the way are these tabs i'm not sure and then um let's go to uh the code i can close this so i've got the digits here now in this command i do want the file system and i want to say uh digits equals or i'm just going to say raw digits equals file system read file sync how do i do this like something like this if i want to go back one directory i should know this kind of stuff and then and then i want to say utf8 okay so i'm loading the raw digits i need a little bit more room for the code here then um let's just see if that works okay that worked so there's all the raw digits now i need to um now i need to chop this up to make it an array of all the digits but i need to so i guess like like what if i do split and i split it by a regular expression which is just any white space let's see what i got okay great so then how do i get rid of all of the row numbers which i don't need so if there are in the digits file one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so every so 0 9 i'm sorry 0 10 20 if the index modulus 10 is 0. so should i use filter i'll call it randoms digits filter is there like can i in the filter function can i get an index so i want to filter out or is this or is this all that i want to keep so i'm using this higher order javascript function i thought i have no idea if this will work to basically filter out everything um oh i could split with the line break says arnab that's a smart idea so but let's see if this works this i want to filter out every tenth element um let's see if this works i also could use the spaces between the row number and the data yeah there's lots of other ways i could do this uh did that work doesn't seem like it yes does not does not equal zero well hold on oh i had console log digits still in there so maybe that did work or if it did it did the hold on i think that might have hold up console.log randoms.length 000 that is not right 22 000 interesting i wonder if as i'm filtering it if the all right let's split it up let's let's do it um let's do rows by rows and i can concat all right let's try this okay that kind of seems right right okay so now what if i uh rows so for every row of rows digits equals rho dot split by any number of spaces and then uh splice the first one out there's 11 index modulus 11 there's 11. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten oh but because the number is there it's eleven oh so that would have totally worked okay let's go back i i don't know i couldn't like my brain couldn't make that happen uh um hold on i'm gonna keep this because i like what i'm uh people were saying that to me in the chat and i was not i was just like what that's weird that's not right i just like completely ignored it but i just see it uh thank you arnov for like being very clear about that let's okay so this should be and i just want to save this other way that i was trying it so let's see if this gets it to me uh oh digits should be an s oops i've kind of missed some things here there we go hundred thousand twenty thousand and one that's weird does um a line break not count as white space it's definitely not equals did i download the wrong file did i download the wrong file why are there only why are there 220 0001 numbers and not 1 million hmm all right hold on let's go back to my rows splitting for a second do i i don't need a g there with split do i for global uh oh i hear my i have a feeling cooking class bacon class has ended it's digits not numbs so weird okay hold on let me let me go back to my more manual way of doing this 20 000 yeah it's a million digits it's never been a million numbers i've been wrong this whole time my whole life i've completely misunderstood this book and i never bothered to check is this about this i'm so confused i got hold on a sec there are 200 000 numbers all this time i could have read this my whole life is alive this whole time i only had to there's only i've i've been thinking there's a million random numbers in this book there's only 200 000 which is fine that makes my life easier thank you very much and you need your stupid 1 million numbers anyway does he probably say this right in the introduction um am i supposed to think of this as random numbers zero through nine the random numbers in this book were produced by a rerandomization of a basic table generated by an electronic roulette wheel should but how should i be thinking of this should i be thinking of the book as a million i could by the way i could only take 200 000 members now of the coding trade i can no longer have one million members i got to re i read the whole introduction but like years ago and i i obviously didn't retain what's in it and i don't think i could just reasonably read it right now um so the question is there are 200 000 i'm going to still consider them five digit numbers so for the sake of argument right now i'm going to consider them five digit numbers um and only um yeah because i want to have i want to have 200 000 unique are they unique or all well let's find out i need to find i need to know right now if all the numbers are unique all the five digit numbers are unique no well no they can't be they can't be unique they are bunched up in fives but you can choose any number of the digits to form your own random numbers as big or small as like that is the idea but how do i use them grouping random digits zero to nine into groups of five does give you random numbers zero to ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine i guess yeah can you see if any of the random numbers begin with one or more zeros they do they do they absolutely do um chris writes i was going to join the channel but now that seems like rubbing it in right there's no way that they're unique but they're not unique how many unique ones are there and so if you get a random number you get it all over the book all right we're gonna keep them we're gonna keep them as five i mean i'm gonna make a just sort of executive decision right now good news is my algorithm here is correct this should give me two hundred thousand five digit numbers two hundred thousand perfect so now i would like to sort this array um so let's do i forg always forget does sorting the array actually change the array i think it does random sort um oh this is more than i have time for right now okay so i've sorted them so is every number there is one question and um yes every number there i need to do like a array to set what if you convert array to set oh that's an interesting idea i was going to manually filter them myself like into groups and every number is not there right if if zero is there four times by definition that means there's not enough space for every number pigeonhole principle i've heard this term before pigeonhole principle yeah yeah ten pigeon nine whole since 10 is greater than nine at least one whole lot of set is actually a good idea okay uh javascript set i wanted to count how many each was in there but that's overkill for right now uh so if somebody's random oh that's why the column and row the index of the random number is actually important that's going to affect okay so there's still 200 000 spots if the idea is that you're getting a spot in the sequence even if you have the same random number now i should try to give people unique random numbers but if the idea is that you're getting your random walk it's going to be 200 000 iterations you're getting all okay okay so i'm actually not going to worry about this right now just for a moment that will come later what i want to do is um so i'll come back to all this and probably be worth making it actually be worth totally making an api oh here's a project for us as a coding trained community let's make an api which has the raw text of the sequence and then you can ask it for like give me um one million numbers random numbers zero through nine give me uh 500 000 numbers zero through 19 basically um so um so that would be that's a great that's another project but let me just follow this through a little bit more so um so i'm going to call this random s which is the strings and then randoms equals random s map parse int elt so this should give it to me as actual numbers okay so now i've got them as actual numbers and there's 200 000 of them and what i want to do is i want the argument of the message i want to give it a seed so if args dot length is greater than zero so let's have let seed equal random math math.random times randoms.length and floor that then if args.length is greater than zero then seed equals um parseint args index zero you know i should check if it um i'll add it to do here to do uh check that argument is valid number between zero and um right 199 999 right then i'm going to call generate image seed so we're going to get the seed here we're not going to do it a million times i start to zero i is less than randoms.length and then the number r is random randoms index i plus seed modulusrandoms.length is that right let me put that in a separate variable index equals i plus the seed modulusrandoms.length so this this should pull and then this should be that number modulus 4. so this should take the seat from from any it's not actually the seed value i should not call it seed right now because i might want to use it as a seed eventually but this is really starting index is really what this is and i'll just call it offset because it's really the offset i plus offset so the idea being that i'm going to always produce the same exact random number pattern um by starting at a certain number in the sequence of 200 000 numbers and then iterating over all of them from there and ultimately i could go through it twice or something but let's see what this let's see what this gives me all right so let's go to discord type generate let's see what i go oh it should tell me the shoot so i want it also to return um return the buffer and also let me do this again um so the attachment is so this is um then i can also say buffer dot index here's your random walk starting at index right that should let me just make sure do this work oh why'd i get an error there let's see what happens i did get an error oh we got an error let's see random is not defined where ah randoms.length this is a terrible name for a variable by the way randoms terrible name for a variable but let's see if this works let's just make sure the bot is live by the way i hate that this is called generate it should be called let me rename it now the now is not the time i want to change the command to random walk or something generate at undefined good work everybody here's your random walk starting at undefined why is that undefined uh return buffer oh it's called offset well no wonder i can't just make up a variable name here okay um i mean i guess i know what it is because i have it here so this is silly for me to get it back oh yeah i don't need to get it back it's picked here what am i doing i mean it's good it's like now i'm making sure it's right but um that was silly let's just do that okay here we go generate it got an error the resource must be a string buffer or val oh oh i'm still doing this though took it out of here no what am i doing where am i okay oh hold on i'm getting some messages breaking news here uhoh things aren't good downstairs in baking class i've gotta go okay 8063 so here here is the real test ah that is so good who's who just joined what was terence's random number who joined uh i'm still returning yeah oh no you're behind me chat you're behind i already fixed that um let's just generate zero generate zero beautiful all right this is good we're getting the unique pattern for any given number in the sequence of 200 000 numbers yes now if i wanted to have it be one million numbers i really could because um because i only have four options for the random walker so i guess i can make that decision later but i want to just change a couple of things one is first i don't need to do this console log anymore um loading sequence of random numbers i so that's done i also want to change this command to rename i'm going to call this random walk and update imports for random walk i don't know sure yes um what does that do oh random walk random walk okay i think that actually should be all that i need to do to change it i should probably put this back to only being in the bot testing channel because that's sort of the point of this particular bot and now hello oh it's it's running um choo choo now generate should give me nothing except it gives me an error because i don't have any error handling it's just the words i thought i added error handling maybe there's a pull request for it generate so now i should be able to say random walk it'll give me a random one so the idea also could be that it would look up in the database my random number and give me that one or i could request a specific one um by and this should still be the same this is still the same image as this one right so we're in good shape now um there also was a pull request i saw that somebody did wrap around so that it would sort of like also come maybe over here if it was going up to the top so maybe i should add that as well but this is good i'm going to say uh get an ad adding the random digits sequence from book um i am um finishing up by the way this is it this is the end of today's live stream i'm gonna deploy this uh hopefully i'm gonna um throw caution to the wind and find the github repo uh for this particular pull request which is now got this i'm going to merge it i'm going to cancel it uh here it's not running then i'm going to go do my ridiculous way on glitch of whoops of of making the bot run so i'm going to go to tools import and export and by the way i'm never supposed to i should not be showing this but i think there's enough characters that are covered up i suppose somebody could probably now check all the possibilities and eventually get it good luck to you i'll just have to uh delete and recreate this project or something um but that's sort of a problem that that just shows up here and now i'm going to do this and then uh it should be running now hold on oh it's still like installing some stuff okay great hi code guppy thank you very kind wait did the 8063 look the same it's similar it's very similar it's a very similar the sequence is always the same you have to remember that it's just where you start so the patterns are actually going to be quite like like if i now if i say random walk one like how different is this going to be pretty pretty pretty similar i can't even tell the difference at all so is that a problem it kind of is but i think that there's still two hundred thousand like if i do one hundred thousand i think it's going to be pretty diff oh sorry random walk so um maybe there's a better way to do this to have them all be more unique um but you can see that they are there are this one is quite different 8063 is not that far away from zero considering touring papa the sun is out oh my goodness it is 3 p.m the sun is out i think it's over 50 degrees fahrenheit here um code guppy you are much too kind these donations are very very appreciated but definitely unnecessary um it is going well thank you for the super stickers and i am going to say goodbye so i got some stuff accomplished today please share with me your oh oh am i blowing everybody's ears out how's the volume of that song right now let me know before i keep playing it um um skip digits different like there's all sorts of ways i could vary this but that's kind of not the point right the point is we're all getting a random walk according to the book slight variations um but it sounds like i am being called away so um i'm just gonna like lower the volume to be safe down here uh are the blondies ready okay but i should stop now huh i'm still i'm currently live streaming but i'm i'm wrapping up all right um it is beautiful outside nice and sunny in michigan are we gonna go out to the park no i'm reading the chat somebody from michigan wrote a nice message in the chat it's we're not in michigan we're in brooklyn all right um my children are here they gave they were kind enough to allow me these two hours of live streaming with you it's actually been about two hours and 10 minutes i'm gonna let this um yeah osama is saying look for a json file with a random one million numbers i could find that that's not the point the point is this is the book the coding trade bible so to speak if you will um this is our text our you know if um hopefully i'm not like by accident starting some sort of strange um cult here go to trade cult but this is this is the core text so i want to tie everything to this book um just for fun thank you austin oh yes for reminding me to thank brilliant um the sponsor push to get it is pushed um i'm also gonna um unlock the bot testing channel and let me do that um let me go to here and go to permissions and go to advanced and back to everyone being able to send messages save changes and i'm going to leave and now you should be able to work with the bot yourself in the discord codingtrain.com discord link in the chat that i just posted as well um thank you for telling me it was a fun stream jiao dat i appreciate that i can't hear the music at all can you um and stay tuned uh there's a selfavoiding walk coding challenge that needs to come out there are four chapter four of nature of code videos that are on their way i have a little short five minute video about a template literal in javascript that i have not seemed to manage to produce that has a theme song so that's coming out soon and um i will see you all maybe so the next live stream i mean just check you know subscribe all that nonsense stuff um you know i will say that i'm pretty low and i look let me pause for a second when i look at my stats i could i would pull them up if i felt confident how to do that it shows me how many people who have subscribed have notifications on and that how and also as a percentage how many people have notifications on as well as all notifications on for my channel i really low like i have a very large number of subscribers but a really low percentage of people with the notifications on so if you don't know about that fee i'm not asking you to turn those notifications on if you don't want to get them i don't want to spam people but if you're not aware of that feature um i would encourage you to go and do that right now in terms of that will give you certainly like when i schedule a live stream that will then show up as a notification when i am live streaming and then of course when new videos are posted as well so a little bit of plug for myself um you know ring the bell hit that bell whatever i mean but but i i i find that the whole like you know it's just noise at this point if you're watching a video and somebody says don't forget to subscribe and click that bell it's just like it's everywhere so you know i i want to be like conscientious about asking you to do things but i do think there might be a little bit of a disconnect where a lot of the viewers either maybe rightfully so don't don't want they want notification and this could make sense actually like maybe you only want notifications from a youtube channel that does like once a month high quality video 10 minutes long well produced uh you really just want to make sure you watch their monthly 10minute video whereas a coding channel might have weekly live streams tutorials popping up every few days and it's just a mess of notifications for you but so i'm going to stop talking about all of that um and just thank all of you uh for being here today there's about 10 seconds left in this song and i will see you i'm join the discord i'm gonna leave this chat will be open for a little bit because i'll play some outro music so if you're not sure about how to join the discord how to engage with the community how to get your notifications turned on how to join as a member all that stuff you can ask it in the chat all right and i will see you all next time on the coding train as always i always forget that this dot these p5.js hearts oh my goodness i uh i knocked over the music as always these p5.js dots are a symbol of my love for you the viewers of the coding train for all the people of the world coders and noncoders alike i see i spy through the window there a beautiful sunny day i don't know what the weather is like might be the middle of the night for you but take some time away from your screens from your computers from your coding if you can it's hard to be with people these days but you can be with sunshine or nature or fresh air or a book stumble up with a book a painting of drawing something um find that for yourself at least today thank you to brilliance who is the sponsor and certainly uh when after you've taken your break from the computer uh i just stopped talking goodbye i can't find the button to take me out of here i found it now never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward new cartesian coordinate song it's the forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me it's the polaroid i noticed people by the way in the chat are talking about the weather where they are which i'm enjoying seeing as i'm kind of like cleaning up and getting things turned off here um uh and i forgot to do this beginning i like to give a prompt and have everybody sort of answer the prompt in the chat and one of the ones i usually do is just like where are you where are you right now and i don't mean like give me your latitude of longitude but like what country what city are you from um and chris sears just joined chris sears you waited you waited until the very last moment but yeah you know you will get a random number i had to come back to give you your very own random number chris sears whose name i see quite often in the chat and i'm glad to maybe see your profile photo and see you in the discord uh we're going to give you on page 96 row 4770 column one eighty eight thousand two eight eight two two seven eight eight i'm gonna think of these as sequences of five digits now eight eight two two seven so the important thing is your index right your index is and we should be able to figure this out because it's ten for if you're in row four seven seven zero column index one it's the second column zero one that's where you are that's the important thing um and i'm seeing where people are from in the chat um i i love that and i am going back to the last song and here it comes unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows i i see chris that we're trying to fly on the red it's a great message so i have lights that blink when somebody joins it's very obvious to me games i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects what else is analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is and kittens kittens yes kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens
