hello again how are you I hope you're doing well uh I'm doing okay I'm actually feeling a little stressed out but I'm going to go forward with this video anyway so I'm starting a new series uh this series of videos is going to be about using data in processing so we'll look at a lot of things where do we find data how do we get data what if the data's from a file or from a URL or how do I chop it up or how do I sort it or there's lots and lots of what form in what's an API there's so many things to talk about and cover here in this set of videos but before we can do any of that the foundation the building block the thing that we need to be comfortable with and happy with and just feeling good about our day with is this idea of a string what is a string now in fact a string is something that's quite familiar to you probably I know who knows who you are or why you're watching this video but chances are you've seen a string before in fact if you watched some earlier videos from just a couple ago we were load we were using strings we loaded an image maybe we had something on our hard drive called a file do JPEG and it was some characters and it was and it was in between quotes this is a string a string is a sequence of characters uh in between quotes now I mean actually the in between quotes part is just the way that we declare a string the string itself is just this sequence of characters and if if we want to do anything that has to do with text certainly we we need a string we need to a way to represent that text but in fact most of the data we're going to look at even if the data is all numbers that data is going to come in as text um so this is something we need to become comfortable with so how do we how do we make a string in processing well a string is a data type uh we now have a variable I I made this I made up this wonderful beautiful variable name s with the data type string and what is the String it is this sequence of character characters so I think one of the things we can first start to look at in working with strings and processing is just drawing them to the to the window so let's um let's come back over here and let's say we have a string s to be or not Tob and you know obviously I could say print line S and run this particular sketch and we can see down here in the bottom to be or not to be that's our string we we're representing it as a variable and we're printing it now let's say what we actually want to do is draw it to the window we know how to draw things it can draw an image it can draw a rectangle I can draw a line uh uh we can draw a string also so I can say text S and then now I need to give an X and A Y where I want that text to appear so let's uh put this in some arbitrary location right here and we can see there it is our little tiny friendly string to be or not to be it's there in the window you can barely read it though let's make it bigger with with shapes we can set colors we can set sizes text is no different I can use the text size function and I'm going to say text size uh 64 and now I have my lovely string here to be or not to be okay so one of the first things you might start thinking about is I'm I'm I'm here to put text in my processing window and the thing that means a lot to me is picking my font that's my joy and life is picking a font and I don't like this font whatever it just chose by accident or by default which it looks like it's aerial or something like that so one of the things you can do in processing is you can say text font and I need to put something in there what goes in there I need to reference a font the way to reference a font is to make a Pont object so I'm going to make uh Pont object and I'm going to say create font and I'm going to use the font George dots one of my personal favorite fonts and I'm going to run this sketch and now we can see to be or not to be is in a different font isn't isn't life good and happy and wonderful that we have we can just pick whatever font we want now okay you know the thing is I'm kind of like you know just going through the motions here because in the end I'm the less concerned about drawing text to the screen I mean that's that's a not that's something that to to it's okay to be concerned with but I'm trying to get to the data stuff the parsing the the chunking of data so let's actually get a little closer to that by looking at a slightly different way to draw this string okay so um for let's take for the moment uh um okay so I'm going to move this string up and I'm gonna draw it again and what I want to do let's put this down a little lower okay what I want to do in the the top is just the string there it is on the screen the bottom is also just the string there it is on the screen but I I want a little thought experiment here what if I were to color each one of these characters with a different color what if I were to draw each character at a different size what if I were to animate that string so that it like moves around the screen like a snake or wraps itself around on a curb what if I want to visualize text in a more flexible and dynamic animated way now I just said the point of all this is not about drawing text it's about working with text as data but actually manipulating the way we draw this text will actually help unlock some of the clues to how we're going to work with text as data so uh how do we figure out like well this is a string this string this string over here is a data type and in fact it's capital S which means it's an object an INT is a primitive data type like just a number a float is just a number a P image is an object an image it's got pixels it's got width it's got height a string also has a lot of stuff it's got this this this sequence of characters but there are lots of other functions that we can to use call upon this object to work to manipulate and work with this string car at length uh index of uh substring two lowercase there are lots and lots of methods that we can call to manipulate and play with these strings and we're going to see all of these in the set of videos I'm recording today and later today and tomorrow and later this week whenever it happens so how do we find out about what these F what what are the possible functions and what do they do well uh string is so commonly used in processing that I wasn't really prepared for this unfortunately I'm going to open up a browser window here and I'm going to say processes .org string and that there is in fact oops a reference page for strings in processing and we can see a lot of those methods I listed over there here they are here and there's some more information you can click on them and there's examples I should point out though however that I'm back uh I should point it's going to happen to the other camera soon in a second I should point out that uh string really uh it comes from java and in fact you know this is kind of like an awful place to be that's making me feel very uncomfortable inside you know actually I I I I rather like it it makes but you know anyway the whether the the Java talks are are very long winded with a like way too much information but and and a little bit hard to parse and find fall but the point is if you really want to find dig into the everything there is to ever know about a string you can string is a class that's part of java processing built on top of java we have access to everything you can do with strings in Java in processing so I encourage you uh I'll try to leave some links for you to go look at that stuff but I want to come back over here and I want to start looking at some of these functions that we use that we can use to manipulate strings let's look at car at and length Okay car at and length car at gives us an individual character at a specific index remember this thing that we that I that we talked about at some point called an array array might be some numbers or some objects or whatever it is it's a ordered list of stuff we access each individual element of the array by its index starting with zero and counting up so this array which has five elements has in indices index values 0 1 2 3 4 guess what this particular string that has 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven eight characters each one of those character characters can be referenced by an index also starting with zero eight the last one will be seven the length of this string you can't see those uh zero uh seven the length of the string is eight each character is referenced by its index so if I want to come back if I want to look at and draw simply the first character here we go there's my T if I want to draw the fourth character there's my B so this works car at Works length by the way will give us the length of the string so let's say I want to go through all of the characters in The String I can do this now I'm going to draw every single character in the string oh look they're all on top of each other right there because I drew them all at the location 10 comma 300 now before I go a little farther with this there's a couple pieces of there's a kind of a key piece of information here that the the mouse arrow is right there at the end of length look at that that doesn't look if you remember an array come over here if I had an array I would say vs. length length being a property of the array that gives me the length of that array five I'm coming back over here look at that length has parentheses length is a function a method of the string object so even though it's very similar this is an easy thing that you're get tripped up on even though it looks just like the length of an array it's actually a function it has to be executed it needs open and close parentheses for it to be called so let's say we want to space these out um I'm going to uh make up a variable called X and I'll start it at 10 whoops and I'm going to uh in fact we don't uh we can like put all this up here now um I'm going to say draw each character at x and x equal x plus I don't know 32 whoops what did I do uh in I equals z let's run this okay now I have those characters spaced apart each one is spaced apart by 32 pixels H that doesn't look right the actual spacing I don't know you you who know about these things like typography that has a term like letting or kerning or something like that you know there's all these nice terms I don't know about any of that stuff but um the these characters are are are this is obviously not right so there's got to be a way around this and in fact in processing there is a function called text width if um I were to draw the function text width sorry gives me dynamically the width of any character that's being drawn in the window so we can use text width to say draw the T now move by the width of that character and draw the O now move by the width of that character and draw the B so I'm going to um I'm going to uh just add something here by putting each character in a a separate variable and by the way the car data type which is a primitive type is a data type for an individual character so I'm looking at every single character in this string which is a sequence of characters uh I'm going to draw that character and then I'm going to move by the text width of that character and look now the string looks just like the one above now we can start to do things like say hey uh give me a random uh fill now we have a random color for each character which we would not be able to do by drawing the text all at once and now we also I could do something like I'm going to actually change this and just say text size random 12 to 128 this I think is illustrates the point even better that now each character is a different size and but yet the layout is still correct so here's the thing there's a lot of stuff you could try here none of this is animated so what if you have the text grow and Shrink or what if you have each character kind of like move around or what if you have it not on a perfect line but kind of on a curve and and I can show you there's if you're following along with the learning processing examples I'm going to go here to chapter 7 there's a couple that I'll just show you to open up um so example uh 17.8 this is drawing the text along a curve this is a pretty high degree of difficulty problem but you know what you could think to yourself is actually could I figure out how to draw a set of rectangles along a curve if you can draw a set of rectangles along the curve then you just need to place each character within that rectangle there's a there's another function that I think there's there's another little piece of drawing text that I've kind of missed here uh which is text align and uh this is also going to be helpful if I say text align Center um you can see that now that each character is aligned by its Center and you can see that it's it's uh off where it's it's located if I said uh with divided by two you can see here now the text is centered on the ren so text align there's you know you can look up and there's a lot of this stuff in uh processing going I go back to what it was before um so that's something you can think about the other thing you might think about uh looking at is and I'm going to go open up another example which is uh 17.10 oh boy okay so let's uh let's zoom in here and let's take a look at this so look this looks just like text on the screen each one of these characters is individually placed there's actually an object like a particle object for each one it retains its own location it retains that rotation information and as I click the mouse you can see they start to move around randomly uh and then if I let go of the mouse they're going to slowly come back to their original location so these are the kind of ideas and experiments you could to play with um I didn't really go too far into actually the font stuff I was was very much skipping over that one thing that I think is worth uh uh mentioning is here let's just to talk for a minute about this create font function the create font function is pulling fonts that are installed on your system it's pull pulling from the system fonts and I could actually look at what all those possible system fonts are by uh by saying P font. list and this will uh this will dynamically pull up a list of all the fonts that are installed in the system and I could you know I could just like pick one of these out and uh put it in here and run this again and we're going to see now I have a completely different font so whatever fonts are available to you you can use in processing um the nice thing about this working in this rendering mode is that the fonts are being drawn as actual like shape data they're not like images that are just being placed on the screen so you can grow and Shrink them and even though I specified the size 6 before it's going to dynamically uh make everything look nice no matter what size you draw it at you have to watch out the if you're in a different mode if you're in 3D or other modes sometimes the font has to be rendered as an image and then if you're starting to grow it or Shrink it it's going to look pixelated or squished um there's also ways of uh packaging a font with your processing sketch Itself by including it in the data folder so you know I'm kind of rambling here because you should have just stopped this and gone on to the next video cuz where we're getting to here where we're hoping to get to is looking more about is is looking more closely as this particular string as data we've seen carat length later we're going to see index of substring and L to lowercase the next thing though that however that I really want to look at which is a sort of key component of working with data uh and strings are the functions split and the functions join so one of the first things that I think we can look at in terms of working with data is have this stuff it's a giant string how do I split it up it's all these numbers separated by commas how do I split those up it's a novel with a lot of words in it how do I split that up and count all the words in it so we're going to look at a few of these scenarios and then we'll get even further to the we'll get even further say like oh well if the data is in a standardized format like XML or Json what's XML what's Json we'll talk about all these things as we get from video to video for now though I would suggest to you that the first thing you might start with is just hardcode some data numbers characters as strings try going through them by character by character try drawing it try um you know what if you were to visualize each one of these um not as the character itself but as a rectangle with a color basically there so many things you could think of um in terms of just playing with strings and drawing and processing okay so the next video we're going to look at split and join and I have to stop this now somehow
