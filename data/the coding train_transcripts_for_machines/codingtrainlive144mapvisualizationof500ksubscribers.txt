primary stream we're not receiving video day not fast enough rate your viewers may experience buffering sure your connection is fast enough or consider lowering a bit rate can you hear me can you see me this big giant red word is on my live streaming page that says bad bad bad your bad oh good good good I'm here with you all right here we are welcome I would say that this is a special Monday coding train surprise visit but it's not really because I mentioned I was gonna be here on Monday and I actually to be honest with you I was planning to cancel the livestream today and then somehow overnight the channel hit 500,000 subscribers which is a much larger number than I imagined could be possible with this nonsense that I'm doing until I thought I should do something to celebrate that I have I have some I have to say though however and I'm just opening up the chat over here that I see and I see the YouTube chat I have to say that I'm you're not gonna see me for a little while after today although I have a lot of content edited content that is yet to be released so there will be new videos coming out on the channel over the next two weeks but I am going out of town for a couple days then I am moving I have not moved in ten years when I'm moving from a apartment to another apartment so that's taking up a lot of my mental time and energy then I'm going away on another trip and I won't be back in New York until July 12th so after today I'm gonna be gone for like three weeks possibly if if if a miracle happens I'll be back next week for like one live stream next week so I am gonna be in town and have moved for a couple days but so I just wanted to put that out there I will I will say though ever that I am planning to go to the barber shop to deal with this because this this can't this can't be going any longer so now oh this is not on let's see if I can turn this camera on now this is what I had been doing previously last week I had been working on a example using tensorflow J s to make a classification project or I'm classifying RGB inputs that are RGB colors three inputs and returning one of nine possible labels that say something about the color like bluish reddish brownish etc and so I'm trying to show the whole machine learning process from collecting data cleaning data training a model and then predicting with new data and that model testing the model so I'm about maybe a third or half way through that and that's the thing that I probably should continue although but I'm gonna take a break from that I only have about an hour and I'm going to try to do something to celebrate 500,000 subscribers but before I get to that I have one more thing to say which is that a project that I have been working on but that I really cannot kind of barely take any credit for whatsoever is this project called ml5 and so when I'm back in July I'm hoping to do a lot of tutorials with this machine learning library which is built on top of tensorflow Jas so if you want to learn more about ml 5 let me give you some links go to ml 5ks org I would also recommend you go to ITP dot NYU edu slash adjacent now adjacent come on ITP at NYU dot edu you can do it you can node adjacent is an online journal from ITP which is the program here at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts where I work and there are actually articles by Lauren McCarthy Adi Melanie C ah knows that COBOL Rupa Dominick Michael Allison Parrish so I encourage you to read all of all of this that interest you in this journal in if you're interested in ml5 you should read everything else but five article I think but if you want to know a little bit more about the background of ml5 like click on this this is the article I put together describing all the people who have worked on the projects and their contributions so you can scroll through here to find out about the history of the project different artists who have visited ITP and contributed there are some interactive demos like this one look that's me and I'm broccoli oh we hit allow oh I can't look oh whoa oh this one I'm still broccoli all right let's move on I think we need to fix that one I'm going to generate some text I'm going to run style transfer I'm gonna kill this computer I did it too many times let's see if this one works this is gonna be great oh yeah see remember how I said I was going to do a ukulele tuner hit the right pitch D so this is a great Hannah Davis put this together it's using a model pretrained model known as CREP clipclip and it detects pitch quite accurately and the goal of this game is to try to sing the correct note F sharp all right so that's one demo and we keep going down here see what else is here we have a word to Veck model pizza is to humans as fish is to birds and we have pose net let's see if this one works which was ported the tensorflow J s by Dan Ovid so I'm gonna do tutorials using all of these things all week this week but I've I guess I'm gonna come back in July and be doing these some information about data and responsible data practices scrolling through here thank you to Google Creative Lab and the Google brain team and the pair initiative and the big picture research group many different groups that Google's supported this project and there are links down at the bottom for where you can find more information oh new sponsor welcome new sponsor Divya Khanna thank you for the sponsorship Wow alright so that's what I want to make that announcement about ml5 and let me be clear that while this is a project that I did work on I am one small tiny piece of many many people who contributed to this we can see a list of many of their names here oh I also if we go to twitter.com slash ml 5 j s this is the ml 5 Twitter account and if I go to Twitter / Schiffman all there's gonna be all sorts of nonsense there I got to see if I can find well what is that oh my god this is me waiting there's like ads here I don't get ads when I and I'm just trying to find the thread oh this is really lame with me this is the thread in Reverse but here we go this particular thread is a thread where I attempt to just quickly describe all the people who have worked on in project and I there are more people than I'm describing here if you go to the github and if you're someone who's contributed I'm alive and I'm not crediting you properly please get in touch with me because it's my goal really important to be generous with thanks and credits in this world of opensource and creative coding and education that I live in all right oh yes another new sponsor damiano's the Nardo so now I'm gonna get to the 500,000 coding challenge and let me get myself set up for that so what I need to do on fluent some music here okay I've got to warm the body up and hope it's Izzie there okay I'm gonna look on github.com let's look for mapa that's not let's look for a map I'm looking for it so I need this URL there's a documentation website as well let's go to here perfect let's go to the desktop and p5 G B subscriber or YouTube this all right subscribe our subscriber so I've got some CSV files here then I'm going to use for the data you'll need this folder all right everyone all right so let me cycle these cameras so I'm gonna tend to do something very simple here and I'm getting a great suggestion from the chat burgerbob rights as a 500,000 special try using new things like visual studio code or live server all right I've got got motivation for all of you watching let's see if we can get to a million subscribers in the next 10 minutes and if that happens I'll switch to visual studio code I mean how about how much longer Adams even gonna be around shouldn't I get to enjoy it while it's still here I love my Adam editor it's just so comfortable for me all right so I'm thinking of using the I'm thinking of using the leaflet API so I think I've enough to say all this again but matthijs is a project oh there's another medium processing or map I'll see if I can get this here we go map attach a s is a project that was a google Summer of Code project from last summer 2017 it really had intended to do some tutorials with it back in the fall but somehow I didn't get around to it and this is an article describing it apparently my name is here whose article for some reason but Cristobal Valenzuela is the creator of the map a library and what it does and this is oh this is a wonderful example when Ben fries original projects called zip decode which is part of his book visualizing data and so this is a project this library allows you to interface with another napping API like Google Maps or leaflet or if we go back to the examples map box and basically embed a map from one of these other libraries into your webpage put a canvas on top of it and it gives you functionality to as you move around and zoom through the map you can redraw whatever you're drawing on top of it and resize it according to how you're moving around of zooming in the map so this is where this functionality is stuff that I'm going to be using this library for it's doing really all of the heavy lifting and so I think I'll start with leaflet because it doesn't require an API key but and look I can play just copypaste this example basically gonna do exactly this example but I'm gonna I'm not gonna copy/paste this example I'm going to try to write it in my own way and look at this and there's some tutorials here introduction to web Maps oh this is amazing look at all this wonderful documentation and examples and projections and this sort of thing also much wonderful information here so what was I saying I sort of looking at the chat this is what happens to me all the time and I should just have a rule there's actually a big there's a piece of paper here a little special treat for all of you on the wall back here behind the camera there's a piece of paper taped to the wall and this is what it says on it look here as I try to remember to look at you my friends my my I haven't seen that mr. Rogers documentary yet but I hear it's amazing and I wanted to say my neighbors there for a second but I don't think that's okay guy okay so look here hello so what I what I have is the data let me put the data in here actually so let me open up Adam I have to oh boy oh maybe I can preview this so I have a subscribers I have I have subscribers by country and I also have I also have I believe watch time the amount of minutes watched by country interestingly enough and this is for all time this is since the channel was started so this probably doesn't accurately reflect say the the countries in the last 30 days but and we can see here United States is at the top that's like it's not a surprise given that to the country where I am Germany where's Mexico come on Mexico that's right go Mexico alright I'll be Germany I like you do great for Mexico so what was I saying use that data for machine learning okay so I think I just gotta get started with this I should have practiced this right so here here just want to see leaflet basic example just saying like what's a good oh this is also such a great reference maybe I can make this doesn't I don't want to put even though it's they here on the internet I prefer not to put somebody's email address on it so right now live streaming okay I guess I don't need to reference to this page I'll just reference that it's down here and then taxi routes Torrio's simple map yeah I guess we could follow this tutorial you see this ah yep all right this tutorial is what I'm going to follow perfect there's a tutorial written for me to do the coding challenge Denmark there's definitely a lot of people from Denmark alright we are going to get started our live streams included in the data yes well okay so just to be clear and I guess I should say this during the I mean this is the I have this weird thing that I do where I like ramble and then I start but it's all me just talking but the question was asked by Medan are live streams included in the data so what I've done to get this data is I've logged into my creator studio on YouTube and I've done the export to CSV so I'm entirely relying on insta microphone it's all sort of off I'm entirely relying on what YouTube is giving me and so and I'm not doing this with the YouTube API which would be interesting to do but yeah okay alright here we go let's get a moveon what's a good let's start with here or here or here or here this is good okay the mic is the mic okay I I could put on the hoodie and then attaches to the hoodie a little bit better but it's do there's like this like heatwave crazy we wave in New York City sound is fine picture is fine what time is it now 423 all right we're doing well the mic shakes a bit when you were dancing and knocks against your body all right let me switch let me switch to this let's try this and see if this is a little bit more stable I like Austin to the chat rightz as long as you're not moving around like crazy the mic is fine well I have got news for you have you watch this YouTube channel before let's see how this goes oh this is my 2017 camera all right this makes it much more stable I don't know what happened to my shirt oh it's because it's under hold on hold on everybody just bear with me this is very professional it's a very professional livestream thing here going hightech professional operation I've got going on here teams of producers video camera operators and script writers and just a sea of people out here tell you what to do with my ears secret messages okay I think this is gonna be better now plus I can do this all right how's that better everybody Kotick trade brought to you by mysterious liquid inside a cup usually I attempt to use my clean canteen not an official sponsor because it's better than throwing away these paper cups but today that's what I have all right try moving around okay so Alka says I need to try moving around like crazy Oh Thank You Dennis for the super chat is the mic okay now what's this I can't do it the pickles okay alright let's I think I gotta get started here I am NOT please be so annoying we're not gonna include that hello I'm making a video coding challenge today to celebrate some large subscribers which is kind of insane and then right after this I'm going to go to the barbershop so please I beware I really let this go here I'm gonna deal with it alright what am I going to do today I'm going to celebrate the subscribers the viewers of the coding train with a visualization and I'm going to use a pretend library that I've been meaning to use for quite a while called mapa j s it was a google Summer of Code project last summer 2017 with the processing foundation created by Cristobal Valenzuela so there if you go to the Napa j/s org website there's a ton of tutorials introduction to web Maps a history of different projections so much interesting good stuff here I also if you scroll down here and really recommend taking a look at Mimi Onew OHA's everything is spatial data and digital mapping work so I love to get into all this but I'm just gonna try to do something really basic I have on my computer if I could find it why didn't I get organized before I started this YouTube here we go I have some CSV files these CSV files I downloaded through the creator studio so I logged in with my account in the Creator studio I went to the analytics and there's an export to CSV so presumably there is some way for me to get this data with the YouTube API and I would encourage you hopefully I'm hoping people will make stuff either with their own YouTube channels or I think it's okay for me to publish this data there's no user information in it so I will check but I'll probably I'll I will also publish this data as well people want to revisit and interesting ways for me or not for me for you but anyway whatever you get the point is this is going very well why have you subscribed to this channel tutorial things for you to watch out there when I was what I was going to show you is I have all of subscribers by country and I have also all of I have watched I'm by country this is the watch time in minutes apparently people have watched a candy I can't even read that that number it's 41 million 100 in the US some 41 million minutes that's really it's really weird I mean wasn't just one person I hope it's gonna this is a mapping visualization tutorial isn't it okay let's go okay so how what I'm going to do here well first so I'm going to come back to mapa the github for mapa is here by the way that all these URLs will be in the video's description if you're still watching or you just left and reading the description however watching some other machine learning tutorial but I'm gonna I'm gonna use this I'm is going to follow this tutorial by Chris called simple now mapa is an interface to other mapping API is like Google Maps map box leaflet and maybe I'm missing MapQuest Welbeck quest still exists that's amazing I'm saying look Map Quest so I'm gonna use leaflet just because from you don't need an API key for leaflet so it makes it a little easier for me to just roll on in and make this project but I encourage you to try this with Google Maps or map box yourself ok bye well let's get started here so the first thing I don't want to do actually it's nothing to do with mapping I want to say function preload because I want to load in all the data so I want to say just celebrate I'm gonna use Const Const is a way of declaring a variable that you're not allowed to that you're saying I'm never going to reassign this variable to a new value there's some nuance to that but that's the basic idea so I'm gonna preach really a means to protect myself here so I'm gonna say Const subscriber subscriber data then in preload I'm gonna say I can't spell subscriber subscriber data equals load table whew now low table is a function inside of p5 as part of peek the p5 chess library that is specially suited for loading CSV data tabular data some other videos where I use that and describe that in more detail so I want to just let's start with subscribers underscore geo subscribers underscore geo dot CSV then I just want to in setup then say console dot log subscriber data so let's first make sure I can actually load the CSV in the first place and I'm gonna go over here hit refresh missing initializer in constellation oh okay well I can't use Const here this is such a failure already so I can't use Const why because this is me reassigning hit kinda sign it up there that's of use let some other day I'll find the perfect I mean you just can't somewhere else in this you'll see it's constant it's very hard to say all right so now we're loading hmm it's still loading this really is not going very well I don't think it's taking all this time to load I think that I have a mistake load table subscribers geode now let me just see here what version I mean the recent version of p5 there there was at some point an issue with using load table in preload I thought that had been ironed out by now let me make a let me just make let's do a little test here well this by the way this videos gonna have lots of extra stuff in it I'm just letting this go no editing no editing I'm gonna make a test dot CSV file so you know it's like an hour or 500 minutes that would be appropriate all right so abc123 so I'm just gonna make a test this is how I like to debug things and I make a test CSV file just try loading that oh I saw something there for a second look it's like they're pre load setup hmm hold on what is going on what what craziness let's see here subscribe or data it's there check the network tab so is this a bug in p5 let's take a look at the p5 github ok let's look for take that back load table I would look under issues cannot no let's try to look the load table preload this looks like it was fixed though this looks familiar to me oh my god I am just doomed to repeat the same videos over and over again I made an earthquake visualize it's visualizer and I think probably I ran into this issue then as well yeah all right all right all right we're gonna let's go back to this what is going on let's put in a draw function and see if that helps anything restart the browser yeah let's just switch to X or because i every every few weeks i redo solving xor with some machine learning technique all right I don't think restarting the browser is gonna do anything here but it's not a bad point whoops okay all right there's a guy there's going to be an edit point here oh it's just being like incredibly slow alko was saying check the network tab why is it being so slow yeah it's just slow so can anyone explain this to me this is going to be an edit queen that's why I made a test file like why did it take 11 seconds to load that file no but I switched to using test dot CSV which is a tiny file and these aren't even that big 12 bytes why did it take a look that's like one second per byte why is it doing that restart the server that's a good idea oh maybe the server is like horrible at this No all right let's try there we go all right so weird weird the Python server was like all right so I'm just gonna go back all right so I had we had to we had to edit there there's no way around it I learned something new so in the browser there's this in the console in the in the developer tools there's this thing called network and I'm gonna hit refresh right now and oops sorry I'm gonna put it at localhost 8080 I'm waiting waiting for it to load the file is only 12 bytes this this was just meant to be a demonstration well I was fine with 11 seconds that would be like a demonstration all right I'm going to demonstrate this a different way okay all right I had to edit this there there was no way around editing it there I did however I think I have a path to move forward and I've learned something new inside the developer tools I usually just look at this console thing there is this tab called Network and what we can see here look at this the test dot CSV file is just pending pending it's never load ago it finally loaded it took uh I can't I want to be able to see it took 26 seconds 26 seconds to load that file that file test dot CSV is exactly 12 bytes meaning that's like two seconds per bytes this is very byte very unreasonable so I don't know what's going on but I I don't want to blame anybody nobody's fault things just work if they work sometimes but I'm getting some weird behavior with this Python server that I'm using and actually if I change and use I have a node server HTTP server also available on my computer so I'm gonna run that be a terminal HTTP server and then I'm gonna go back over here oh wait no have to go to a different yes different port and look at this three milliseconds test CSV so now we can go back we're getting somewhere we're getting somewhere I can go back to subscribers underscore geo dot CSV there we go okay now we've got that file I'm gonna go back to the console I'm gonna look at subscriber data and I can see there we go I've got an array with a 237 rows that means there's 237 oh there's fifty three columns there's lots of extra data in there other and there's two hundred thirty seven rows now one thing is all the cop none of the columns have a name so one of the things I want to do is p5 if I give it this nice little second argument and say header I think that says the first row in the CSV file is the header and we can see that if I click on here you can see these are all the headers that are actually there in that first row so now let me go back and refresh I'm gonna look at the subscriber data again go look at here we could see ah there it is so country name country ID and subscribers and then there's other all sorts of other columns transactions and ad revenue and all sorts of stuff so I'm probably going to clean up this data when I publish this just to have only the first three columns country name country ID and subscribers that's all that I'm gonna use for this example so now what's next I need a way of iterating over every single one of those so let's just look at how I might do that I don't know how but for let I equals 0 I is less than subscriber data dot I don't know total columns let's look at the API p5.js org let's look at the reference I'm gonna look for p5 table and I guess if I go here to p5 table we're gonna see add row remove row get rogue find row find Rose match row I'm looking for total uhhuh Oh columns rows looking for Rose it's just in a field subscriber data dot rows I plus plus then I'm going to say the row is subscriber data get row I and let me just look at the rows go back here let's look at I haven't done this in a while line 10 Oh Rose it's an array of all the rows that's even more convenient so let row it's not a number I thought it was a total of subscriber data row I can use a for of loop and now I can just look at each row one at a time there we go that's each row one at a time then I can say console log row get column what were the columns again country let's look country oh it's sort of like atom just knows it's not a country ID and let's do this ooh get column is not oh maybe it's just get yes there we go get it's just get and I get the country ID now I want to get a console log row get what was it called subscribers okay awesome there we go so I now have a country ID followed by subscribers country ID followed by subscribers okay we're getting somewhere should probably find the minimum and the maximum and normalize things but we'll worry about that later okay now now let's go back to the mapping tutorial what's been like two hours since I started this I'm gonna go back to this simple map example and first of all I need to include a reference to this map map a library in my HTML file so I'm gonna just copy paste this here and I'm gonna go to index dot HTML and one of these days I'll learn how all this fancy new module stuff works but there's no way I like to do it right now when a reference that library let's go back to the tutorial Oh welcome to reading through a tutorial and copying the code over to your code code but thank you to this excellent documentation for the map library so I want to create a look at this there we go Const let's create a new map instance so I want to make a new back pulling from the leaflet API just to be clear leaflet is this a jaw opensource JavaScript library for mobilefriendly interactive maps so again you can use leaflet directly by just going right there and looking at how the code works mapa provides a layer on top of that also because it you can pick other things besides leaflet as well as it integrates nicely with p5 and probably other JavaScript libraries alright so now let's just refresh let's make sure things are still working things are some ooh there was an error at the top there ref because it's mime type is X not executable what did I do wrong here hmm we have a little bit of an issue strange why did map oh let me just take what's going on here why did I get that error message let me take out this console.log Oh Oh No okay doesn't seem to mind it with the p5 libraries hold on there's no added weight nobody no one's telling me anything what's going on here let's look at this Oh interesting so I think it's broken I don't know if Chris is watching yeah so this let's see hold on now let's look at NP oh look at this point five I got point zero zero four let's look at NPM I mean NPM mapa this is the same exact link I mean I could just download the library whoops yeah weird so I'm just I don't know why 0 0.5 is not working I assume everything will work fine and 0 0.4 I hope that's not going to trip me up but let's file a github issue oh yeah look at this ah yes yes look at this oh look at that there we go okay so I can use js2 liver okay well this case that's okay to see the end if age is broken that's good see let me shake shy shy shy I won't write a note here cuz chris is there in the slag group alright so this is my I'm gonna use this okay I'm back okay I'm back it turns out that there's just a little bug with this CDN link and so I'm gonna use a different CDN link which is this one and it's working check the map web page for whatever the currently working version of this is by the time this video gets published hopefully it'll it'll probably be fixed okay Napa is now loaded excellent okay so now we can go back and we can go to this tutorial once again I was on this simple map tutorial and we can see here what's the next step I want to create now there's different kinds of maps I can create there's what I'm and the world is broader than just this but I'm gonna talk about two right now there's a static map and a tile map a static map is a map that's just give me the map it's the image of the map I'm gonna draw it I'm never gonna change a tile map is one that I want to move around zoom in and out of and the reason why it's called a tile map is because the way that the mapping API has generally load it is they loaded as a bunch of different tiles because you don't wanna get one big image all at once you get a bunch of different image than they get tiled so I want to create a tile map and this gives that the arguments here is like well what do I want where do I want the map to be centered around and what zoom level do I want to be so let's try napa my map equals map a tile tile map so i want to say i'm gonna go back to here and i'm gonna say I'm gonna say let train map and I'm gonna say a train map equals mapa tile map and let's just give it a latitude longitude of zero zero and a zoom level of four that was what's in the tutorial and let's see if we see that at all I'm gonna go here and so now one thing is hi let me let me meet saying let me get rid of the canvas all right so I probably missing a step here I know that I have to overlay the canvas but let's see I don't see the map yet do I need to overlay the canvas or yes I guess if I don't overlay the canvas the map doesn't show up perhaps creator of map Allah is in in the chat right here so I might here in a second what I'm saying that's wrong so I'm going to so I need a reference to the canvas I'm gonna say canvas then I'm gonna say canvas equals create canvas and then I want to say to which do I say which the the map a map I want to say the training map I want the canvas to sit on top of it overlay yeah I do so confirm breaking news I do have to overlay I'm not going to see the map unless I overlay the canvas on top of it okay so these are the steps here I want a canvas that I could draw on I want a tile map and then I want my canvas to sit on top of it so now if we go here whoops train map overlay is not a function mmhmm Oh camera that's another edit point train map overlay train map overlay is not a function okay what I'm doing a terrible job here let me go to the tutorial my map dot overlay canvas did I take overlay with a capital L yes I did overlay is one word people lowercase L okay here we go unload setup sketch mmm what did I get wrong now new map a leaflet just giving up on the no editing thing does it not work with preload I have notifications on my phone does it not like preload let's just take this out for a second shouldn't matter line 14 which is here canvas train map and actually this map a tile map overlay canvas hmm click back through the stack Oh does it expect to promise no oh I did it not ready yet let's look no this is what it says in the tutorial here let's try previous version of mapa nah there we go okay everybody we found another bug just wanna make sure why am I not able to move around in the map we just make sure I get this working first how come I don't actually see a map oh damn I missing like another step I didn't really read the full tutorial oh yeah I need to put these in I need to put I need to say what's style we just need to specify a set of tiles a warning message so I didn't see the warning message oh you know what there is a warning message I think I have warnings turned off how do I turn warnings back on you used to the way I used to do this YouTube channel is I would do this like in class during the day and I would work all this stuff out then it would come on to YouTube and I'd have all this stuff worked out read the manual I be going wait where is the setting for warnings I'm kidding very like very sweaty over here show warnings I want to show warnings it's not showing me the warnings I don't need to go into settings for the warnings show warnings show warnings show me the warnings click on filter output there we go okay okay okay okay all right backing up backing up backing up Oh does pointfive require a promise no I don't think so yeah the the error is probably a p5 error so let me just move on here okay oh it's not a p51 okay I never so much for my no editing so is there was another edit there unfortunately whatever reason whatever I'm doing is throwing giving me an error I discovered if I revert back to one version earlier of the map a library then the error goes away so I can refresh oops I have to hit save and then I can refresh AHA now okay so first of all if you're watching this video hope the source code is hopefully going to by the time you're watching this be using the most recent version of map but maybe I'll have to figure that out but for now I'm going to keep going now interestingly enough it says you are not using any tiles for your map try with so one of the things is I have to specify a particular set of tiles that I want to load and I would have just read further down in the tutorial it would show me that actually one way to do that is to put all of those things like I was saying I want the center to be zero zero and the zoom level to be four now I need to also give it a style all those can go into a JavaScript object so I'm just gonna copy paste this from here this is a YouTube video where I am copy pasting code from the tutorial and like making lots of mistakes still somehow anyway and then I'm going to put this here and then I'm going to put instead of putting the arguments directly in the function I'm just gonna write the variable name options we are now going to refresh again and now look at this there is my map so one thing I really want to do is I want to give myself more space to work with so let's try like 800 by 600 and I think I want to zoom out by default a lot more so what I know I think a lower number would be zooming out yeah that's maybe too much 1.5 all right that'll do to start okay so this is what how I want it to load initially and again maybe zero zero isn't the best middle point and there's all sorts of other things I could do but no we've got the map there now I just want to do something I just want to say ellipse 100150 let's just see what happens if I draw and I'm gonna do a nice purplish color which is my favorite color do this look at this there's that ellipse now that ellipse is staying where it is so they're at a minimum what I have right now is the ability to draw over the map and I can do all of the map interactions and my p5 canvases right there now I have to be careful if I were to put this background here I don't see that map anymore and what I really should be doing is using the clear function the clear function is like putting a background that's fully transparent so this now you can see I don't know if you could notice this before without the clear function there was some funny antialiasing going on because I was drawing the circle actually on top of itself multiple times okay but the point is what I want to do is let's say I have a circle that's on the map over here if i zoom in I want that circle to stay where it is and grow with the map okay so how do we do that let's go back to the tutorial and I'm not gonna worry about lat/long but oh yeah no no I do want to worry about that so this is the key here lap map lat/long to pixel so the idea here is that I have a latitude and longitude and I want to find the pixel location of that no matter where the map is so let's let's just take this no matter what the zoom is let's take this and copy it into our code and I should now see it refresh oops I got an error again la Oh my map I called a train map so we can see there is now a circle here hopefully on top of the country of Nigeria looks right to me and I can zoom in and we can see that circle is continuing to move as I move the map around now here's the thing so I happen to find that from the example thankfully I just got a message in the chat for the next thing was about to look for which is a data set that has the lat longitude value for every single country so I'm just gonna I think I could probably Google for it canonical countries CSV lat/long something like that would probably yes this is what I'm looking for I'm looking for the countries dot CSV data set and this now has a country each every country with the latitude and longitude associated with it so how do i download this country's that CSV you'd think there'd be a download of sprinkles paid somewhere somebody's gonna tell me how to download this uh tutorial guides I could star it I like it I'm gonna give it five stars uh I don't know I don't know where to download this samples overview no this menus not helping me I'm just looking to chat like I become so lazy in my live streaming that instead of trying to never figure anything out I just hit her wait till somebody that jet tell me what I'm this thing which is really not good oh my goodness is five o'clock already this is not good this is not going as expected do I have to like query it somehow geo XML oh it's gonna give it to me in XML samples okay samples canonical concepts is it the geo on all files no geo not taught us entity no geographic canonical concepts don't download from here there's another oh that gist okay syndra sore huh schist and number one three four one six nine nine okay this will work okay download buttons in all files we hold on I really want to figure this out all files where's all files let me go back to samples tutorial all files downloads ah here we go but like tutorial date isn't weird this is crazy yeah it would be easier to copy/paste at this point wouldn't it my cuts over here I really need to just put the chat over there that's ridiculous this really seems insane am I in the right place even remotely close to the right place canonical concept geo all files downloads there we go same thing let's try downloading some of these toriel ah to sit it's got five countries in it okay so that's the tutorial maybe it's the DSP L tools alright I'm gonna give up I'm gonna give up and use that Geist at the bottom there's a CSV link okay hold on hold on Kelly Murphy is sending me a mess message public date okay hold on developers.googl e.com/appsscript CSV let's get this page that's not a dolly that's just to this page okay okay where's the gist okay okay if somebody can figure out for me you can figure out how you download this file sure I could copy paste it I can't find anywhere on this page of how to download this file and Norah in the chat seems to be telling me so I'm moving on I got a nice suggestion there is this github gist and I can just click over here to raw and this is now every single country code with the lat/long I'm going to assume that this is correct I'm going to copy paste this into a new file I'm gonna call this country's dot CSV and I'm gonna paste it in here so now I have au not CSV it's JSON excuse me countries JSON and so good so now I have all the countries and their lat/long by a and JSON so now I need to go back to my code and I am going to say let me have another variable called countries and I'm gonna say countries equals load JSON and countries dot JSON so now I want to just make sure that that came in okay console dot log countries well I'm gonna be going away for a couple weeks after I record this video and get back everything's gonna make sense and work again in my tutorials I'm not gonna make all these mistakes and never get anything that okay so there we go so now I can see excellent so I have I want to have beautiful the object I can actually look up by the country code great I can look up by the country code which is exactly what I want so now let us let me take this loop I'm gonna go over here kind of I think that in a moment I am going to now get the country ID now I think something a little bit funny is going on here where if I look here the country IDs are in capital letters and in my countries JSON file they're lowercase letters so I'm gonna need to be conscientious about that so I want to say let country equal Roget country ID and I'm gonna say I'm think I could just say to lower case is that a JavaScript function in Java there's definitely a string function that sends thing to lowercase so I think that's right then I can get the lat/long is is what I want to look at the countries by country and so now that's going to give me that array with lat/long and then the latitude is the lat/long index 0 and the longitude is the lat/long index 1 and now I'm gonna say I want to say the pixels pixel coordinate is train map and now I not hard coding it I'm getting it from that so now I say I'm getting it from that the JSON file lat/long and then now let's draw an ellipse at and I'm just gonna call this pics at pics X pix dot y 20/20 so now I should see a circle at every single country where there is at least one person who subscribes to the channel and here we go what did I get wrong here cannot read you know interestingly enough this is live this is like this very generic error that's coming up no matter what if I do something wrong sketched out yes line 41 what have I done wrong let me look let's look at these first console dot log country let's take a look to make sure my countries are actually correct those look right those look like reasonable country codes let's say no loop by the way because right now I just want to do it once okay so those look like the country codes now let's see so this is countries countries dot ad is that and so I should be saying a console.log lat/long let's look at that okay oh there's some that are undefined so first whatever reason I have some countries in my dataset that I don't have a lat/long for so I that's why I got that error message so I just need to be careful about that and I need to say only if lat/long exists like there's some that are undefined then I should be able to pull the lat longitude out and draw a circle and let me get rid of no loop now let me say fill 255 0 200 let me put my semicolon there oh yes so look at this look at all of you beautiful people all over the world who are subscribed to this channel from all these different countries this is amazing oh and I got this horrible thing going on where I'm console logging got to get rid of that you do not want a console log from within a loop within a loop zillion things that'll really mess stuff up let's go find Australia Australia look at this let's can we find a country with nobody I'm not sure country that I need to so we really got the center of everything this is great okay so now we're getting somewhere I can see everything there and now what I want to do is actually size the circles according to the total number of subscribers okay hmm here's the thing Oh timeout for a sec okay here's the thing now first of all I want to use the whiteboard but I'm working on this color classifier with tensorflow yes these are all my notes from and I don't want to writes it so just bear with me here this is like a moment of insanity here I am going to talk you through something in a little like blank area where's the blankest the blankest of the blank areas looks like this is a nice little blank area over here that I can use can you see all that I got to get to the barbershop before it closes you can't go I'm in town looking like this we try that one more time alright here's the thing I want to talk you through something that's a really important little crucial detail here and I want to divert it for you but maybe what I can do is just turn the camera I'm working on this I'm working on this oh boy I shut the camera off by accident am i back yes I'm working on this tensorflow J s color classifier and I didn't want to race my notes for it so now I think I have some extra space over here so sorry for being completely like a crazy person not like whatever I'm gonna diagram this for you here so here's the thing I am drawing circles in p5 with the ellipse function can you see that I think you can the ellipse function so let's say this is a circle with a diet with a die diameter of 10 and this is a circle with a diameter of 5 okay circle with a diameter of 10 circle the diameter 5 let's say this is a country with 10 subscribers and this is the country with 5 subscribers have I visualized this accurately no the answer is no why think about this for a second if I were to do this this is a bar chart 5 and this is 10 you know this is accurate this is twice the size of this is this twice the size of this will the radius here is 5 I make these like 8 and 4 the point let me make these 8 in 4 just just please please please please allow me to make them 8 and 4 so the radius is 4 and the radius here is 2 right so what is the area of this pi rsquared 16 pi the area of this pi r squared 4 PI this is actually four times the size as this so I need to be conscientious about this what I actually want to do is take the total number of subscribers and apply the square root to it so that when I when when it's being visualized into a circle it will actually be representative the area of that circle will represent the total number of subscribers okay we can go we can come back over here now all right so here we go this is where I am let me see what was the zoom level when I open it up great so now what I want to do is I should be able to write here say let subscriber I like let's say like sub count equal Roget and I already forgot what's in the CSV file if I quickly look at it here it is just the word subscribers subscribers and I'm going to say let diameter equal the square root of the sub count and I definitely should do some sort of mapping but I'm not going to worry about that right now and then I'm just going to then put diameter here and I'm gonna give this some alpha because I have a feeling I'm gonna have some really big circles and now I'm gonna refresh there we go look at this we have now visualize the subscribers and we can see here this makes sense like there is a lot of subscribers in India and we can look at we can look at Africa we can see that South Africa and Kenya and Nigeria if we look up here in Europe we can kind of see here that Deutschland Germany and England over here we can see the different countries France so this is actually and this should be accurate I could write the number there's so much I could do here visualization wise this really isn't like a tutorial and in the end about you know the visualization I'm really just trying to get the mechanics of it to work and one thing I might want to do I mean that the circles are just so wheat why are they oh they should be sized according to the zoom level Oh weird I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat oh sorry people are in the chatter talking about other stuff um I just realized something the circles are not resizing according to according to the zoom level so how do I do that there's got to be a way in the map a library let's look at let's look at the API so if I go under leaflet we can see look this is actually changing right we can see this example the circles are changing and let's see how that's done map dot zoom so map zoom so this is a way that I can use the zoom level of the map to change the size of the circles so one way I could do that is by saying something like diameter divided divided by train map dot zoom is it just dot zoom oh it's a function dot soon so let's see what happens there where do I go now oops ah where was where was I come back did I lose it oh no I'm over here okay so now Oh No I think I need to multiply it by zoom hold on I have a new sponsor pause for a second no don't let I have to thank the sponsor after thank you it's clx thank you it's C like solo new sponsor I got to get those emojis and icons okay all right if you think about it the zoom level right I come back to my crazy little place over here if you can share with me for a second if I have a circle like this a higher zoom number is me zooming in so I don't want to divide by the zoom level I want to multiply by the zoom level because the size of the circle is going to be what it is at zoom level one if i zoom in by two that circle should grow twice the size so I don't know why I didn't really need to walk over there but mentally I need to take a break okay mentally I just need to take a break here so I so what I need to do is say times zoom and then now look at this it's everything's way too big so now I need to figure out an effective way to to lower everything so one thing I could do is I could find that I probably should just like preprocess the data in setup right there's no reason for me to like do all this parsing over and over again so let me preprocess the data in setup and I'm going to create my own array so I'm gonna say data is just an array I'm gonna say data is an array then I'm gonna go to setup I'm gonna paste in that loop I'm gonna get the country and then here I'm gonna get the pixel oh I don't want the pixel location I just want the lat/long and the sub count so then I'm going to say what am I gonna say here I'm gonna say data dot push I'm just going to make an object now guess what what's that thing called in the new what's that thing called in new JavaScript where you I want to make an object and what I want to do is I want to say lat lat longlong lon sub count sub count this is how I this is how I always have written my code I want to create an object with these properties and the properties have the same name of the variables you don't have to do that anymore JavaScript new fancy JavaScript yes something or other allows me to just do this lat/long sub count and by definition it's going to assume that if I generate an object this way that I want the property name to be the same name I want the property name to be the same name as as the actual variable name itself D structuring I'm being told restructuring I don't know I'm structuring I'm structuring this we we are there two thousand two thousand people watching this right now are there to pause for a second enhanced objects literals it's enhanced object literals this is not going to go is a thing white very recently in something somebody told me in the slack channel about it and then I should be using it okay apparently it is known as enhanced object literals so this is an I want to create an object literal and I want to create it in an enhanced fashion so now that I have this now that I've done this now I'm gonna do a little thing here I'm gonna say max subs equals 0 and min subs equals 100 infinity now I know I know I did I am using enhanced object literals and I know there's a higher order function sort of fancy way that I could just do this instantly but I'm just going to since I already have this loop anyway I'm just gonna say if sub count is greater than what was it max subs then max subs equals sub count I just want to find what was the largest number of subscribers and I also want to find out what was the minimum number of subscribers so now that I have the minimum and the maximum if I come down here and I can now I can just say for country let country of data and oh oh I want the country ID I need that Oh No look at that I don't I guess I don't need the country idea anymore okay I mean I I want to save the country ID so now I just want to say I don't need this if anymore I don't need this lat long all the parsing has to be done I just want to say now I just want to say country dot lat country dot long and then I don't need to the sub count is right country dot sub count and I want to say that and this should be a constant so should be I'm gonna say the square root of hmm boy I'm having a lot of extra square roots here let me let me actually add let me do this let square let me do square squirt square root I'm gonna just put the diameter in here square I'm gonna to calculate it up here just once and I'm gonna add this in here and then you know what I'm gonna do let's just do all this up here I'm gonna just do this parsing up here too then I'm gonna go through it again one more time yeah yeah I know I could use a higher order function I expect many pull requests and comments about that and I'm gonna say and now I'm going to say let country of data and I'm gonna say country dot diameter equals map the country's diameter between the switch goes between the square root right right right right right I don't want to put the diameter in here I'm gonna add I'm gonna add a new probe there's no reason I'm gonna add this property here and I'm gonna map I'm gonna same in diameter is the square root of the min subscribers and the max let's just say mindy and the max d is the square root of the maximum number of subscribers so now i'm going to map the countries the square root of the country's subscribers which has a range between mindy and max D and I'm going to map that between 10 and 100 and that's the country's diameter so I wanted I want to process I want to just sort of like normalize the data within some range add the diameter property and then right down here I don't need to do any calculations I'm just gonna say pick sex pics why country dot diameter and you know with the ellipse function by the way you don't need to do the width and the height if they're equal and then I'm gonna say train map dot zoom okay I think we might have gotten somewhere here I don't need this anymore and now here we go let's refresh Oh max sub is not defined okay where do I call max subs max subs hmm we're all all of you where are all of you subscribers Oh did everybody unsubscribe all of a sudden because of how long it's taking me to do this and how what a mess this video is okay oh not yet no okay let's do console.log data let's take a look at this let's see what's in that object okay the object is an array with lat/long sub count ooh diameter equals not a number so I messed something up there so let's see oh this has to be outside of here why is that in there Oh so this is something I want to do right before I do this mapping I don't know why I had that in there well you still should have worked let's console.log min subs and Max subs see does that getting a real zero and 98 that doesn't seem right more than I have more so max subs a zero min subs is infinity if sub count is greater than max subs hmm that seems weird oh yeah my sizes are probably way too small but hold on those seem like strange numbers to me zero and 98 I have more than nine subscribers okay country dot sub count where did I get that wrong oh yeah but still why is max subs here so so low let's look at this console dot log sub count huh yeah look at this there are some much larger numbers in here do I have that in the wrong place subscribe I know that this is wrong blind 59 yeah I know that this is sub count I see that now but I'm wondering why is this saying 98 right here Oh square root no no no but a console blog did here did my square rooting it's somewhere else oh I square it no no no this is unnecessary look at this one more time hold on why why why all right I have let's look at this console look sub count max subs welcome to watching somebody not able to figure out a problem debugging debugging 9898 look at this are they string somehow because oh they must their strings they're not numbers look at this if they're strings in alphabetical order 9 8 is greater than 9 79 I was not being careful the value that I'm getting out of the table is not a number I need to convert it to a number it's by default and I think probably I might have been I'll say something like get number in with the p5 API or I'm not sure let's see get number is that part of p5 no but I could say get and then convert it write a CSV everything is by default text and these should probably I don't know why these sort of worked somehow oh because it came in as an array and somehow oh no because I I'm pulling it I'm that's coming from the JSON file and they are numbers in the JSON file the CSV it was only text so now there we go that's the maximum number of subscribers that makes sense I can get rid of this I have I should see right there we go so now if i zoom in the sizes aren't changing right the size no but I want it to change oh did I not put that in you know I'm multiplying by zoom so let's let's see something here yeah what did I get wrong yep console dot log train map zoom let's make sure I got this right the zoom is to zoom is 3 flip min subs and Max subs know they right but I want them to be a fixed so I think it's doing what it's supposed to do right cuz the more it is working but that's not what I wanted to do I want it to be the same size they don't want to be 0 right I want this to be much much smaller now so I did want it to divide by the zoom I just need to make them much bigger then let me so in other words hold on is the zoom linear oh wait let me think about this it's nonlinear that's the problem that's the problem multiplying is correct it's nonlinear so long so what did what did Chris do in the example plus my map zoom huh that's interesting I mean that's one way so is it is it just squared yeah is it just squared yeah No oh yeah I just needed to do the same thing square root right that's now doing what I expected all right look at this look at how that circle is over the United States no no I mean it's sort of an interesting so what is the formula leaflet why is everything more complicated than a nice zoom is probably working as a more complex object which you build using those integers yeah yeah power to to the zoom oh oh well that's interesting it's some silly Google ratio yeah I think there's a standard I've read about this before I've encountered this before zoom a Google Maps API zoom what's the right zoom level range yeah there's some Mercator projection so the scale varies substantially with latitude a formula for correct is based on latitude is to this Wow oh but maybe if it's yeah log scale makes sense log base 2 I think that's part let's look at the mapa API no so there isn't a isn't necessarily a so this would be an interesting to add to Napa power to to the divided by power 2 to the zoom or cater let's see hold on no multiply I probably have to go ahead and use that everything's way too big now oh yeah this looks right right I mean I'm not sure that that yeah I think this is right now yeah I mean it might be slightly off to to the zoom okay great right I got first where did I leave off let's just go yeah here let's go back to here okay so interestingly enough this is not a surprise here but this is not a linear relationship as i zoom in from 1 to 2 or 2 to 4 I'm not actually just doubling the size so formula that I can actually use it has to do with the way the zoom that that the way that I'm learning a lot from doing this video it turns out and this shouldn't have been a surprise to me I have encountered this before I think that it's not a linear relationship when I zoomed from 1 to 2 or 2 to 4 I'm not just doubling the size in fact so multiplying by the zoom isn't really getting me a consistent size circle as I'm moving and zooming around so what I really actually want to do is not multiplied by the zoom value and I think I'm just going to be a little easier to see if I say constant zoom equals so just put it in a variable train map zoom and what I want to do is the scale the scale I'm just going to say SC l because there's a function in p5 called scale is 2 to the zoom power now this I don't know if this is a hundred percent exactly right but so I'd have to maybe do some research on this and maybe someone the comments can give me some help here if I'm if I'm getting this right but let me just put this in now scale now now the problem is now I'm multiplying by a very large number so this is kind of looks a little bit out of control so let me go back to my values up here where I was doing this mapping and I'm actually gonna have I'm gonna map between 2 and 10 so the minimum number of subtractions go between 1 pixel and 10 pixels so now if i refresh here we can move around and we can see like look at this you can see here if i zoom in on Brazil you can sort of see look look at the size of this circle right and then we keep zooming in it's kind of staying the same size relative to the country so this is the effect that I wanted and again me being off by a slight amount and now I could potentially say like okay well actually I'm happy to go I mean all the way up to 5050 and we can kind of see here maybe this helps a little bit but now everything's kind of on top of everything else so I liked it maybe let me go back to 20 you know anyway so the point is this isn't necessarily the best way to visualize this data maybe what I actually want to do is visualize something about the number of subscribers per like relative to population or maybe what I actually want to do is get the sort of geo JSON data which is like an outline of all the countries to fill them in but I at least have done this and guess what just as a quick little extra thing to add to the end of this video and by the way look at all these subscribers down here in the Virgin Islands is that where I'm looking at the wrong plates that's kind of amazing to me I'm gonna swap out my CSV file let's quickly look at the watch time file the watch time also has country ID and watch time in minutes now the nice thing is the nice thing is I already built in all this stuff to kind of normalize the data between the minimum and maximum I could also look at views maybe I should look at views watch time probably makes more sense so I could really briefly right here change this out and I probably should have just called this I'm going to call this instead of subscriber data I'm gonna just do a find and replace subscriber data with like YouTube data replace all and I'm now going to swap this out and say watch time Gio I'm gonna comment this out and the only thing I need to change is I also want to get here now instead of subscribers I want what was it called again a watch underscore time underscore minutes watch underscore time underscore minutes also by the way had one in sub count I should change also which was views let me just change this everywhere it's a sub count let me just change this to count just to be more generic about it and let's make sure the okay and so where it where am I here sorry views let's see if this works with views there we go so now we're looking at this map based on views and now let's look at watch time and I can go to switch it out just by commenting it to watch time minutes oh look the same be interesting to see what's the relative difference these are like watch time per subscriber that's something I could visualize here I'm sure that many of you watching this could come up with a much more stylish or perhaps more effective way of communicating this so here's the thing I will publish these data files along with the source code for this particular video I would love to see you maybe we can have some rainbow themed train themed visualizations and try it with other try it with other mapping api's try thinking about it in different ways how can you communicate this data better than I have and I hope you will share that with me so thanks for tolerating this video which is very very long where I struggled with a lot of aspects but to me this is a really exciting that I can have a tiled map that I can zoom in and interactively move around as well as draw on top so by the way these can all be animations this is the other thing like so I've done nothing visually or interesting here really or I'm not animating anything and that's the other thing you should really think about right so just to like quickly make that if I say like frame count module is 255 and you know the the scale the size the is the scale is also times you know sign a frame count times 0.01 or something right I'm just gonna add some weird stuff to animate it right you could see that these are now hold on let me have that animate a little faster 0.1 you can see that they're blinking right and that blinking is going to stay consistent as I move around the map and the color is changing so this is the other thing you could do you can animate this stuff so what can you do with this data what can you do with your own data what can you do with maps that look like this with other maps think about the projection that you're using research about different mapping projections in different ways of showing maps and make something share with me in the comments share with me at Schiffman on twitter and also look for the link in the video's description to the coding trade comm page where you can submit a contribution a link out to one of your contributions as well okay thanks for watching this and thanks for subscribing I mean maybe you didn't subscribe it's just fine you don't have to subscribe but for those of y'all subscribed thank you thank you for watching thank you for everything it's an honor and a privilege for me to get to make these video tutorials and have and reach people all over the world and let's just have a look one more time and all of you all over the world there you are all of you all over the world thank you okay I got through that is that is that really very fun to like dev DeMarcos Rosa wants to see wants to see my city where's your city Canadia I don't think it's called Canadia where's Canada so this is Canada here all right I'm gonna take off that so one that that this crazy stuff and I'll leave the color cycling because I think that's useful for I mean just to sort of make the point okay Thank You Sammy Hoss whoo all right I've really got to go this did not happen in the one hour I'd planned for everything always takes me longer everything is always harder than you think that's the way of coding maybe for you you just breeze through everything but I don't think so I think you're probably more like me you get tripped up everywhere it's always embarrassing and I hope you enjoyed this live stream could you make it that we can see where the viewers of this live stream are so in theory that's possible but I'd have to probably use the YouTube API for that I could try to research that and see but I've got to go it's almost six o'clock and barber shops that's gonna go with definitely closed so I don't know I guess this is me this is what you're stuck with I I should read some random numbers for the 500th livestream not the five livestream them for whatever I'm gonna go to page 500 there isn't a page 500 the random numbers only 400 is their page 500 for the I guess I could read 500 random numbers let's just do 50 I don't know what to do Oh 500 plus 100 400 plus 100 is 500 so I just need to go to 100 here we go one point four eight four negative one point five one seven point seven four zero point
