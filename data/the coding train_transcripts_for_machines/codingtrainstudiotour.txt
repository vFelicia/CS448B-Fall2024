okay I think I am live I have no way of knowing other than that I see a live uh but it says live on my phone here but it doesn't show me that anybody's watching oh finish finish oh no no I don't want to stop that's if I want to stop ah somebody showed up okay so I'm here at New York University New York University uh and I've had a lot of requests let me know if those are you leaving messages if you can hear me okay um I've had a lot of requests to do a studio tour I'm sitting at the tissue of the Arts I think this floor is technically the skirball center for New Media and uh this is the view look it's kind of like a uh there's some sort of beautiful sunset Cloud action happening back there in New York City um and I'm going to flip the camera and I'm gonna walk down this hallway and into this room I'm gonna use my ID it's gonna open and then here we are so this is what is this is the room I don't know what else to do now okay let me let me put the camera on me yeah I hit the camera because I didn't want to like show other people who maybe didn't want to be live on uh on a live stream so here I am in the room uh where I record all of my videos and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through I'm going to actually record a couple videos in a moment but I'm going to go through uh it's quite small yes there's some filing okay wait hold on let me turn this around I'll show you some things first that are in the room and how it's set up it's a bit of a mess and then what I'm going to do is gonna I'm gonna go through and um I'm going to go through and sort of set up all the things I need to set up and then I'll switch to the actual recording system and live stream so first of all uh those of you who are interested in uh uh coding train merchandise here's some sample tshirts that I have uh you can see let's see I'm gonna turn on some of these first of all here's the thermostat uh let's see maybe I can tell it to cool down in here turn that on to 90 minutes uh uh okay I am going to uh turn on this light to make things brighter there's a button here oh it's not plugged in I forgot I have some things unplugged this is really riveting uh uh okay so I'm going to plug in some of these lights uh and then this light is on this is the camera so this is the this is a Mark 3 camera you can see it has HDMI out which I am getting here uh and that camera is pointed at this particular whiteboard and the Whiteboard is in fact painted onto the wall so this is the uh whiteboard paint over here that was used to paint onto the wall okay now so that's that's this side of the room camera light now I don't actually have the lights pointed towards the Whiteboard unfortunately because it's somebody warned me about this this whiteboard is very very very reflective so uh it it's um so that didn't really work unfortunately okay now over here this is the table that I stand behind it is a kind of standing desk Contraption it has this uh button on it yeah we can move up and down uh and then you'll if you're wondering first of all there's your live chat I think is this oh no this is probably a live chat with something else um this is the computer my my uh monitor which I use to sort of see what everything looks like so let me uh I have to figure out let's see hold on let's see what I can do I am going to put my phone right here on my laptop for a second and I'm going to start turning some things on um okay so I got to uh I am going to log out of here uh I don't know what I'm doing here leave uh I am going to uh um so what I'm doing right now is I am getting my computer set up to uh live stream so and I shrived on this in advance and I can see that I can see people sending me message I need extra haircut yeah oh I really should have gone to like get a haircut and trim the before I this was a bad idea to do this studio walkthrough you're getting a much more closeup view of my very not so nicely manicure itself okay um here we go okay um okay so now you can see here uh this is the that I use uh and um it is currently not plugged it's this is just it right here that's the screen that you usually see but what it needs is it needs to be plugged in to the capture system so I'm looking for this particular cable this is gonna plug it in once that happens resolution changes and I look over here now look over here on my monitor oops my fingers in front of the camera point which is not very good production value I figured by the camera again okay uh this is my uh monitor that I look at to the side there's my random digits book with a train whistle and you'll notice there's a big black Square there so why is there a big black square is because that is the uh rectangle so to speak that uh is the place for the the image that this camera sees so I'm going to turn this camera on and now as I walk back over here you will see that there I am live keyed uh with the green screen behind me and the monitor so this software that you're looking at is called wirecast and uh there's an open source it's a it's a broadcasting it's made by telestream it's broadcasting software and um there's an open source uh free uh equivalent called open broadcast studio and I'm thinking of switching over to that um just to use something that's open source I think it's open source um but wirecast is pretty great I have enjoyed using it I best had some issues this morning where it was crashing but a couple things that a wirecast allows me to do if I turn on this other camera uh turn on this other camera oops am I pressing the wrong buttons oh you know what maybe it's not plugged in let's see here whoops press this button no why is this camera not turning on oh okay hold on Hardware oh Hardware debugging session is a terrible idea hoop this looks like this cable goes to here ah it got loose Maybe all right I'm gonna have to hold on I'm gonna I don't know what you should look at right now uh I gotta put my phone down for a second to uh test this okay let me uh let me put it here and do this okay hold on a second I am going to go down I can you hear me I am going to go over there to check to see if the cable is plugged in I do need this camera to work to make videos okay uh so here it is but I've never had this problem did I unplug something unwittingly one thing that I could really use is like cleaning up all these cables aha the reason the camera is not turning on is this this must go into an outlet okay I'm going to plug it in now I'll be right back uh now plug that in and now this needs a different plug which is here and now magic of magic this camera I believe ah it turned on and so now uh here we go uh camera which is pointed at this whiteboard is now I can see it there as shot number two so uh basically the way that I switch while I'm live streaming between shots switch this back here the way that I switch between live stream within shots is I have them mapped to key strokes so if I press one then that's what I see if I press two then that's what I see that's what I'm so I can live switch between the two views and I can also press three which goes to this ridiculous video so uh whiteboard uh camera and laptop and a ridiculous video so I really only have three shots I also have another shot which is just yeah that's it oh I actually have this um which I don't have a key map to it but that is just a shot that shows exactly what the uh camera is seeing so there's my random digits here's my train whistle and uh yeah at one point I actually had oh and like a big red button it wasn't that big and that was like much more fun to use but then I realized I could just use a keyboard and so that's what I uh switch I prefer a Blackboard no Blackboard ah the chalk on the Blackboard ah it gives me the like tingly wiggly wiggly uncomfortable feelings so I much prefer a whiteboard uh what else are in the show okay so a couple things so all of this stuff how's this working like what computer is running this so um the computer is on the back uh Tower and you'll notice all the inputs running into it so all of these are all those camera inputs this is for ethernet um this I believe is the microphone uh I'll share that in a second uh though maybe this is the microphone I know what this is oh it's just the keyboard probably so everything runs into this Mac Tower and then that's the this is the streaming computer um and so one thing I need to show is so here's one of the cameras for example coming out of the camera is this HDMI cable so the cable comes all the way out this cable doesn't go directly into the tower it goes into this particular box which is called I think it's like a black magic intensity extreme so you can see it's HDMI in and then Thunderbolt out so this is necessary because it's not natively a captured um oops uh it's not natively a capture device and there's one of my lights so let's turn on this light this is another light I will turn it on it does makes the keying much better um so there we go I turned on this light and now that's this light with like a soft box so I I could really use one thing I really want to do is um get a little bit of a grid going in here with more light so the lighting is a bit more from above uh what else do I have to show you I have some I I rated my kids uh train toy uh bin at home and brought some Train toys in thinking I would use them as props I haven't figured that out uh yet how to do that let's see what else is in here uh lights I showed you the shirts that I'm putting on making available um and okay so other things um um all of this stuff here is oh this is um this is the uh lav mic this is what's going into the computer with a little antenna here um and I have two bars of battery left so I oh it does say low battery is on so I might switch the batteries before I start and then that connects to uh this particular microphone so this is the microphone that I uh use to um attach to myself and talk into so now you can see that it's on over there you'll see green on the right so I can tell that the mic is working and then the other thing that I sometimes do for sound effects is laptop here uh this output which goes through a magic a black magic box into the computer I can actually send audio out of that as well so I capture that audio into wirecast so any audio playing out of this laptop also appears so I don't know how to demonstrate that super easily but so then I do a weird thing which is that I AirPlay an iPad to get audio from like a soundboard on an iPad but I really want to redo that system it's not working very well for me um but I can't believe that there's 745 people watching this right now I'm about to switch over I think I'm I've done all the setup stuff I'm about to switch over to do an actual tutorial this was just a little bit of a preview people have been asking about a walkthrough of the studio uh I can see chat comments here maybe I can kind of take a few questions about what's going on in here so if you guys could um kind of um limit your questions to questions related to the studio have I ever thought about doing a live show yes uh clean your whiteboard I really need to clean the Whiteboard why oh the camera and the pressing the button uh the camera is top switching the the camera and the pressing the button I will the issue with these cameras is and I probably should just use different Mark 3 5D cameras you know the things I like about them is I can put a custom lens on it I can have a you know Focus they're good quality there's lots of good things about them they also natively do HDMI out the Mark III the Mark II does not so I just get a nice clean output the problem is and apparently um this is yeah so I what I need to do is install the Magic Lantern firmware but I'm a little bit afraid of breaking the cameras so I just kind of haven't gotten around to doing that these cameras are you know technically used for other things as well so these aren't my personal cameras they're you know borrowed um um oh yeah how much how much are those lights from the third yeah there's the lights aren't that close to the thermostat there is a light there and there's the thermostat on it um so I but the room does kind of heat up and um in theory I should be getting air from up there but I haven't really noticed that okay what button do you press when you switch between the Whiteboard and the green background so I showed that previously already but just to show you again um I just use keyboard shortcuts uh and then I can switch and you can see it on my monitor over here so that's why I'm kind of often oops my computer went to sleep that's why I'm often over here doing this uh whoops you can't see I'm doing this like I'm pretending that I'm referencing things where really all I'm doing is my hand is by the Whiteboard um and I I what I really want to do is install a big giant monitor up there behind the camera because what I would like to be able to do is read the um like sort of see a live chat uh um sort of see a live chat while I'm looking forward as opposed to looking to the side you can see this is the chat that I look at during the live stream I also have a second laptop which I'm not going to open right now but I have a secondary a laptop over here which I use to um kind of monitor uh the stream and that sort of thing uh okay hold on let's see what else why do I use a Mac that's what I have any specific reason why you use a Mac Pro it's what I had access to um ah have I thought about using a light board yes so I have this idea I've had this idea and I haven't really had the time to sort of think about it but um I uh I have this idea to uh have a glass pane or like right here between me and the camera so I could draw on it and it would be in front of me and see through as opposed to uh the white that is behind me so yes I have thought about that okay I think what time is it I have no idea uh yeah so this studio is at New York University I I work here at New York University full time this is actually like on a quick uh storage closet it's a big storage closet you'll notice that these are there's some filing I don't know what's in the filing cabinet it's the mystery it's a mystery to me but they are in here there are filing cabinets uh okay um thank you everybody for watching this um I I can do a more thoughtful version of this another time if um do I look better if I put the camera higher uh and but I think I should get going with doing some actual tutorials so eight all 814 of you apparently who are watching which is nuts which is now 805. um uh oh I should create a this dot shirt that's a great suggestion um that's a great suggestion I should create a Vista shirt and maybe I'll do that um as a kind of limited special run maybe I can do it as a fundraiser for a good uh coding cause um so uh I'm going to turn off my phone which will turn off this live stream and then I'm immediately not immediately but about five minutes I am going to a switch and press this button up here which will turn on my stream and also record a backup and that will send out what you're seeing here straight to YouTube um someone asked when I'm gonna have a people are asking about the name of the channel I guess I'll since this is like a just sort of arbitrary let me just um give the sh the short version of this story so I called the Channel coding rainbow at one point because I love an old show called Reading Rainbow and I love the idea of rainbow as a friendly welcoming symbol um and Reading Rainbow is one of my favorite uh well it's a program that I a television program that I loved PBS uh program here in the United States about reading and literacy with a wonderful host named Levar Britain um so I kind of didn't really think that I was doing a thing because I was just kind of making videos and I called it a coding rainbow um as a sort of idea um informally and then I went a little bit too far with it and I think that I started doing this more as a regular thing and um unfortunately the you know rightly so the logo and uh was too close to Reading Rainbow and it was confusing and a bit of a trademark issue so I decided um uh uh to change the name um and the um I went through a lot of different options and coding train trainbow seemed like a good idea at the time and so that's what I went with um as a new name so maybe next year I'll change the name again but there will be there was a coding Rainbow song a music video and there still is that music video in song but it's all been redacted uh and blurred and some of the lyrics taken out so um I am working on a new one with the same composer Adam Blau uh and hope to have a new video as well so um why do I stream on YouTube not twitch I don't maybe I should stream on Twitch YouTube has just been the platform that I started you I used to have all my videos on Vimeo and I uploaded a few to YouTube I think it was maybe a year and a half ago and I just discovered there was a new audience for it there and I used to stream both to Twitch and YouTube but I never really caught on and sometimes the chat and twitch was a little bit you know sometimes the chat and YouTube isn't as friendly as it could be but in uh the chat and twitch was um there was a little bit more of a kind of meanspirited energy I'm sure there's plenty of twitch channels and chats that are lovely somehow I just didn't like catch on anyway um so I am going to uh turn this off I do teach uh fulltime at uh New York University yes a program called ITP if you're interested in learning more about it you can go to itp.nyu.edu I also used to record my videos at a place called the school for poetic computation which is sfpc.io that's an independent Artist Run School here in New York um but now I'm back and kind of doing most of the videos at NYU okay so here we go it's I don't know what time it is I gotta check oh it's six o'clock that's when I said the live stream would start so I gotta turn this off I don't use open broadcasting studio for streaming but I'm thinking about switching to it could I keep streaming both I have no idea let's try haha this is exciting okay okay okay okay okay okay I'm gonna put this here I'm gonna put this here okay phone is here there we go there I gotta collect this laptop in don't worry it's not going anywhere still here this is really exciting I am going to what's gonna happen double live stream on the same account can't let me do that can it uh I'm a little bit too tall for the way I did my phone let's see if I can do that okay so now what I'm doing just to narrate what I'm doing turning on my laptop I'm looking at the live stream preview over there uh I see the YouTube chat let me open up my slack Channel so if you're wondering why I keep referring to this slack channel is to um to support to kind of have a bit more of I don't know I have a patreon I don't know I don't know how to describe that I have that patreon is a thing where people can contribute monthly to content creators and a Kickstarter like way and I have one and so as a reward for that patreon um I uh have a a slack Channel where um you know it's a little bit easier for me to follow that chat live because it's a smaller group and also it's a continuous Community a very warm lovely community so if anybody's interested in that um you can go to thecodingtrain.com okay let me go over here oh look at this it says I'm streaming right now okay I'm gonna type I am going to try to stream stream in both places typing that into the YouTube chat okay now I'm gonna go check the slack Channel and go to my live Channel it says reconnecting retry connect connect okay um okay what shampoo do I use somebody asks well I do have a bit of a dandruff problem I probably I don't know if that's a good thing to admit yeah I have a lot you know I have some mild psoriasis I've got lots of issues lots of anxiety but you know I'm doing I'm Trucking a lot I'm I'm here I'm doing my best um shampoo I don't know I just use whatever shampoo is nobody else is using in my house I like teach Tea Tree Oils it's very soothing uh okay see Manny I hope you really appreciated that answer that question uh okay I am now going to I am going to attempt uh uh going to attempt to stream in two places will it work okay so now I need to put the microphone on I can't see that this chat anymore um uh okay I can't really read the YouTube chat on my phone right now because um it is a little too far away from me I I have some Vision issues that's another issue I have it's glasses I think I need a new prescription I need reading glasses good thing about the Kindle is I can make the font I love to read books are a great thing uh fiction I'm all I'm all about I'm in the I'm on the I'm like way behind the times but I'm I'm in like I'm I'm in Harry Potter and Game of Thrones lands those are the books that I read okay uh here we go so I should probably tweet that uh live stream happening again Friday evening live stream uh HTTP youtube.com user slash shipment live and there we go I tweeted that now I need to I have I don't like having these two Twitter accounts I have at shipment I have at the coding train I don't like that now I'm going to retweet it from the coding train and hit retweet there we go so everybody's been notified who needs to be notified close that down and go back to my slack channel uh use https okay here we go oh all right I'm just looking your pullover is so purple yeah anyway okay this is an exciting moment I've got 820 people watching here I'm about to go live also on YouTube right here where will there be more people how many people could we get will it be the same people can you have both up I don't know this is just a moment eventually my phone battery is gonna die really but we'll just let it keep going what is that Google shirt Google summer of code I'll talk about it in the other live stream okay here we go is the audio working I've got the Nikon well let me put it in a better place um and um here we go let's try it chord string okay I should be live now here
