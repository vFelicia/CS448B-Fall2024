hello it's me Dan coming to you strangely sort of from the future perhaps I'm not sure how you found this video but this video is about how to use p5.js with the brackets code editor and the reason why I'm making this video is I'm making it anybody could be watching this and it could be useful but I'm making it if you are right now a person watching this playlist if learning to program learning p5 is completely new to you and you're learning with my materials you'll notice that in all of these beginner videos I referenced something called the p5.js desktop editor so that desktop editor is no longer being supported you can still find it and download it and in this video I'll actually include a link to where you can download it but I would suggest that you use a different editor all the contents of code everything should still work and be the same in all of these video tutorials but you might want to follow along using a different editor there are lots of possibilities and perhaps I'll even make a few different videos show you different possibilities but in this particular video I'm going to show you how to get started from day one with a p5.js project in an editor called bracket so brackets you could fisa is an open source text editor that knows about the web and you can find it at bracket Co and when once you're there all you need to do is download brackets it's all in version 1.8 I'll have to come to you on the future was like even more this guy's like a lot more gray hair in this video than just what you just watched and then there'll be another one about you know this other futuristic editor where I've got my cane or something in here but anyway I haven't lost track here the point is a brackets 1.8 is the current version I already have it downloaded and over here as installed on my computer so if you want to follow along pause this video download it and then come back so I'm going to go ahead and launch bracket and here we go brackets is open and you can see it's kind of opening up with some default it's probably open up with some like getting started project in it for you and this is something I actually don't care about so much so really what I want to do is right now open a p5.js project the next thing I want to do is go back to the web this web page here and I have also over p5.js org slash download so this is previously where you would have downloaded that desktop editor I was referring to and now what I want to do is just download this complete library so you'll notice here this says p5.js p5 zambia people i've found that yet and an example project so this comes with a bunch of files which are the individual library files those like matter to you to some extent but for us right now we don't need that stuff what we really want is that example project so if you click that and download it you're going to get a file called a p5 zip and I already have it right here so this is the file that's going to download p5 dot zip and now I am going to extract that file and it appeared right over here and I'm also just going to open this up here so we can see so this is really this folder is the one that I care about the most this folder is all I ever need for the rest of my time programming and making beautiful p5 sketches so I'm going to rename it and I'm going to call it shipment p5 and then I'm just going to move it on to the desktop so it's it's own thing and you know I can even then just just because I'm so confident I'm going to get rid of that and I need to minimize this stuff to find that folder on my desktop which is over here so this is now my project folder I'll put it up here in the sky so this is now a project folder and it has what matters in it is that ultimately this sketchyass file this is where I'm going to write my p5.js code now what I'm going to do is go back to bracket and I'm going to go to file open folder this is important I want to open folder I could actually just that well open folder because I want that whole project folder to be open in bracket and then I'm going to go to my desktop and I'm going to click on shift in p5 it's right name that folder I'm going to hit open and there it is so you can see now it's a little hard to see but in the corner up here it shows that hey there's my folder and here's what here the files in it I can go into sketch jf I can add create canvas 400 400 I can say background 0 and I can say ellipse 200250 comma 50 so I've written my p5 sketch here it is and now here's the exciting thing right over here this little button here the give me a tooltip to say what it is I believe that is the live preview button so over in the top right hand corner over there is this little like lightning bolt and this lightning bolt is like a play button in a way it's called live preview so what this button is going to do it's going to take the folder that you have a code that you're working on and load it into your default web browser so that you can see the result so what I'm going to do and by the way I could get to this also for file live preview and you can see this is I don't know what this is all command P or shift command P or something from keyboard shortcut so I'm going to press this over here and we see that Chrome opened up and it's taking a moment and now it's loaded that sketch so here's the result now the question you might have is well what happens when I want to make change some code so you know background should really be 51 not zero as you all now and now if I go back to Chrome and hit refresh maybe that color was too similar let's make it something less similar there we go so you can see it's actually live up updating so I can actually move this over here and you can see that even let me make this a little smaller it's zero hit saves and then it actually updates so this is a way that you can work you can have your code editor with live preview save edit whatever and then you can also have over here over here the actual sketch on that you're looking at so this could be a workflow and I'm guessing that some of you especially if you're a beginner to coding and you're looking through my tutorials and now you're suddenly using this new thing called brackets there's going to be a lot of questions that come up so please feel free to ask those questions in the comment and what I'm going to do is come back perhaps to make another video just followup and some of those question a bunch of confusion points that everybody's hitting and trying to to use brackets so there are two important additional features that I should probably show you for example you know I've made my opus which is this beautiful red background with lips and what I want to do now is make another version of it another project I want to base it on this project so of course there are all sorts of elaborate methodology is for keeping track of versions of projects and iterating over the history table but here's an easy thing you can do if I minimize the browser and this I can actually just take this folder just copy paste it and say like and it actually already renamed if I would say Shipman underscore p5 so now I have another project I can go back into brackets and I can go file open folder and I can now go and open the other one and now I have a different friend I can make some changes to this one with a different background I can go to live preview and we can see here we go there's my new project so if as you go from project to project what I would probably recommend doing is just duplicating that empty that that project folder which had all the library files and everything you need and then you could open up that one in brackets and edit its own sketch JS file and as you as I go through future p5.js tutorials you'll see there are lots of different analogous situations of what I'm doing in the desktop better you can do exactly the same thing in this particular editor for example if you need it at some point I'll show you oh you might want to change something in index of HTML then that's just a matter of me going over to this file and editing that file but for at least these first videos the only file you need to edit is sketch Jaya now here's another thing you're going to see at a certain point I look at debugging and one thing that I might want to do is say okay well what if I want to know is this draw function actually happening so I want to I want to put some print statements in I'm going to say print setup function because I want to see some messages print draw function and by the way this is exactly identical print also console dot log do exactly the same thing so I could say console dot log which is logging a message to the console and as you'll see in future videos I use this to check the value of a certain variable to see why something isn't working is that color what I think it is did I get the data from this web server there's all these reasons why I might want to log messages to understand how the program is working so once I run this where do I see those messages well the only place I can see those messages is in something called the JavaScript console in chrome if you're using a Chrome browser it has it built into and other browsers have this too but and the way I can find it I know a shortcut which is like option command J but I'm going to show you where it is under view under developer JavaScript console so this is what I want to find view developer JavaScript console if I click on this then I have my JavaScript console here and you can see here the messages set up I had a message once and then the draw function is getting printed out over and over again and by the way Chrome developer console is kind of smart it says like oh if it's the same message over and over again I'm just going to say how many times it's been printed and not keep showing it to you but if I did something like prints console dot log the frame count which is a builtin variable that's counting how many times the frame has executed and I hit save and go back to the browser and I hit refresh we can see here now that frame count is showing up in the console over and over and over again as a new number okay so this is the kind of thing you can do I can also just close that console by hitting the X and I can get back to it again through the menu or through a keyboard shortcut so these are all the pieces you need you need a place to type your code brackets sketch is you need a way to run that code and send it to the browser that through the live preview button and then you need to view the results in the browser and also check the console which is also the kind of place by the way if you're going to have error messages so if I were to do something like I'm trying to think of what a error message might be that if I'm going to miss spell background right by misspelled background and I go over here and hit refresh you're gonna see that's where I get my error message back gound is not defined because background is not actually a function its background so you also find error messages there and notice here it's saying sketchyass line number seven and over here what's on line number seven back down and I can see I need to change that within R ok so hopefully this helps you get started with making your p 5gs projects using brackets and let me know again in the comments if their questions confusing things I know that the most because I'm going to get it but my favorite editor is this or my favorite there this editor is better for this reason there are lots of editors lots of ways of viewing the results brackets just one of them I also have two other videos one that shows you something called sublime text and one that shows the atom editor and I'll link to those two videos in this video's description for a couple of our options as well and I'm actually going to make a couple more videos showing you a couple other things you could use to okay see you soon maybe in another video
