ok so where where where is your head at I'm not really sure but maybe now you have a sense of okay I kinda get what programming is I've gotta write instructions with a specific syntax and I could choose all these different languages and all these different environments for different kinds of applications and for different operating system and for different hardware but here we're going to use Processing. what advantages does processing give us what kinds of things can we make with processing what is the lens that we're gonna look through to learn the fundamental concepts a programming this is key we're not I'm not it's not my intention here for you to learn processing it's my intention for you to learn the fundamental tools of computation we're going to use processing as the environment to learn those tools but those tools those concepts will go across any programming language environment that you choose to use in the future so why as I said processing we it's a thing we download we can open it one of the first things you might do yourself and I'll kinda do this for you is take a look through the examples so you can see here there's a little window that you can pop up that has examples and you can kinda look through look these basics and some of these basic things will give you a sense of what is processing doing. you can learn about color, you can learn about form, you can learn about math so if for example I just go here and lets say we wanna learn about hue with processing I can run this particular example and you can see that what it's doing here is as I move the mouse back and forth across the screen its changing the hue of the color that I'm drawing so there's a range of examples and you'll notice these examples, generally speaking have a visual design component so if you're interested in design, animation, images, creative applications of software, processing is a good environment to explore ideas in that area Umm another thing and I'm just gonna kinda give you a quick range as you look through you might start to look through a lot the examples under topics and one of the ones that's sure dear to my heart that you might look at is OK simulate so there's a lot of nice examples we can look at this idea on what of simulating physics elements through processing you can see there are some circles on the screen as I click them and move them with the mouse my head is always clearly this is very poorly what I'm doing here. Umm they there they have this springlike motion so one of the nice things about processing is there's a when you downloaded it, there's a wide range examples and to get a sense of what can I do, what are some ideas of things I might try to make you could you could spend a whole day just clicking through and running all of the examples Umm the other thing that I would just mention is that processing has a in addition to the sort of 2d drawing engine which allows you to draw simple and and kinda complex shapes and animations in 2d you can do a lot of stuff in three dimensions as well I guess I'll just open up this one called Planets and we can see here's a nice Whoo this is beautiful! I'm going to have to use this for something, but here we can see, err this err, nice little demonstration of how you can do 3d rendering in processing as well err and you can see, you can do, all sorts of different kinds of camera stuff, lighting stuff, textures all things that you might find in a 3D computer graphics environment that' what you can do and you can do with the processing environment as well so this is I just closed everything that is the examples the other thing, it's just something else I really want to mention about processing so okay so here's something I kinda should have might have wanted to mention, we have this a show like crazy list of all these programming languages that I was kinda saying aaah, okay, so here we're using processing and one thing you might think it's like oh is it just processing, it like this toy environment that I can kind of just do a little like experimental ideas in buit can't really make a a largescale projects with; so one of the things that I like about processing is both its ability to allow you to get started very quickly and learn the basics but also you can build fairly large scale sophisticated projects in it and one of the reasons for this is, is that you aren't learning the processing language yes you're using the oppressing environment yes there is a a set of processing functions that are that are that are needed for processing itself but really the language a that you're writing code in is Java, now Java is probably about right now, and I refer to the era that we live in, 2013, it's probably like the least cool thing you can learn like it's much cooler to learn JavaScript or ruby and and there's lots of great stuff you can do; i mean javascript is especially on the web now and, erm canvas and webGL all this amazing stuff that I also encourage you to learn but there is an advantage to using Java or the fact that processing is built on top of Java, er, you know Java is kinda in many ways I i've heard this said about Java err something silly, but, it's not the best language for anything but it does everything, so if there's anything you're thinking about doing, if you are you wanna like read your email into your processing program and then draw little bubbles on the screen for every email you've received or you want to connect to the Microsoft Kinect or you want to use err this physical piece of this hardware you want to use the sensor erm, you can really do just about anything you'll find a java library out there for just about anything so processing because it's built on Java is incredibly extendable through libraries now what are these libraries and you can see I'm into if I go back to that examples window erm, looking through those examples topics I could go down to start to look at you want to use the libraries one which i'll just demonstrate really briefly to you right now is video so under capturei'm gonna look at er, one of these examples; gonna run this mirror example and I think this will work err, its effect we should edit it's taking a minute or so here we can see a look what's interesting is this is a green screen so you can see the green wall in the actual camera so the camera here is reading my image so processing can connect to pieces of hardware through libraries, can connect to your camera and what this example is doing is it's taking every single pixel from a regular good oldfashioned image and instead of drawing that pixel as a a a drawing that pixel as a rectangle on the screen rotated according to the brightness or something so you can see that we can create this abstract visualization of the data the color data that's coming in from a camera this is, err, something we'll explore in great detail in a future video how to write these kinda examples how to capture images how to read pixels, how to draw stuff based on those pixels; so be the video library is something that comes with processing when you download it but processing itself has a huge, has a large community of people making libraries and I downloaded one an arbitrary one called the Yahoo weather library we can tell, just open up this example erm, this library allows you to connect to Yahoo Yahoo weather data and you can see here that this processing sketch has grabbed the weather information from the city of berlin, it's fair, the wind direction is three 10 which must maybe is a err, angle! and, erm, and the wind speed is a eight kilometers kilo kilometers I became French, so kilometers per hour so you can see then this others these particles these dots that are drawn on the screen that are moving according to that wind direction so connecting to data sources there if you have an idea for something and processing doesn't do it if you can write the Java code for that you can make it into a library and you can do it in processing so the processing is tremendously extendable through all sorts of libraries, if you want to get a sense up what the available libraries are for you, er, if we go back to the processing website waa and go to libraries you can see there is a nice list of tons and tons libraries and you can also get them, which II this is err, through, err, through this library manager that comes with processing software itself so we can go through this list of libraries and if I want this library which is a lightweight library for creating animations and trans transitions I can click Install and it will install that library I can use it in my code okay! so this is kinda at least a little bit of, erm, me getting started showing you okay! here's the process development environment. here are some the examples, here some libraries, here's the kind of things that can do and next thing I wanna kinda briefly look at is just a quick range of some projects that have been made with processing to get you thinking about looking at erm, largerscale installations and animations and and things that people are doing the first project I'm going to show you what's called Chronograph by Casey Reas, one of the creators of processing and Tal Rosner, I apologize if I've pronounced the name here incorrectly, erm, this is a project which I'll skip to the end here to just show you this timelapse. you can see this is a projection piece that's projected onto the side of this building which is New World Center in Miami Florida for the New World Symphony so this is the time lapse of the piece running, this is showing it more quickly but you can see this idea of abstract visuals projected on the side of the building this is all generative, procedural this is a piece of software that generates this content that's projected on the side of a building, this is something that's done a lot with Processing, erm, I, a I teach a class here at ITP where the students create work for a large video wall erm, here are a couple of examples of projects. there, this is a project called Beluga I'm skipping the sound but this was a dance performance and you can see that there are these dancers that are moving and jumping on tramp trampolines. this a hundred twenty foot wide video wall, it's about twelve feet high and the visuals, regenerative. this seascape and they responded to the movement's of these dancers who were bouncing up and down on trampolines. so this was actually, er, it's using processing but there are three separate computers running three processing sketches each controlling a section of the video wall so even these types of largescale 3d performance graphics for performance are made with processing; another example of this for the same space; this is a project called replica which here there was a dancer live in the space with the camera pointed at her and her image was then a projected onto the wall and manipulated with a bit series of different kinds of timebased effects and there's music, the dancer and all happening in real time; all happening live okay I'm realizing I'm forgetting to mention people's names but I will erm, there'll be links below where you can find out the the wonderful people who made some of these projects so another thing that processing is used a lot for is for motion graphics. this is a great project by Molly Schwartz where she did an animation about eels; now err, called err, Bellyful of Eels; if you look at this a lot of this is done with After Effects, err, but here in in in this particular part of the the err, animation, these eels that are actually swimming through this underwater pipe sewer like space; those were actually made in processing rendered out from processing and incorporated into a larger animation project and there are lots of wonderful examples music videos that have been made with Processing or different types of elements that you wouldn't want to hand animate, that need an algorithmic, generative process to, whether it's behaviors or repetition, were done with code, with Processing okay another, another co like popular use of processing is for data visualization a I'll show you a wellknown project by Jer Thorpe This here is a visualization it's grabbing data from Twitter and looking for people who said, you know who are very excited about the fact that just landed in Hawaii, for example so anyone who posted 'just landed Hawaii' if it was me I wish I would have gone to Hawaii, I've never been there but erm, my home location on Twitter will be New York Jere the project parses out the locations New York and Hawaii and the time that the tweet was posted and draws a, this kinda arc path from the original location to the landing location so its a visualization of people posting on Twitter about their flight and you can see different views there's this kind of like horizontal view now it's spinning around, all this is done through code through an algorithmic process to visualize this data and you can see kinda ah, well you can't really see that but ah, up here at the top left um this timescale showing where we are and this er, ah where we are in time. so this is a a great use of processing and it looks like oh my goodness this very like complicated crazy 3d how I could ever possibly learn how to do this; we're going to start with some very basic things like how to draw a circle how to move a circle this is really just doing that also is just lots of circles, a little bit of 3d, the what's happening with those circles is controlled by data so all this stuff is possible through learning the foundations of programming and a a little bit about how to draw do stuff with computer graphics as well. ah, so I'll I'll this is a great project by Mary Wong if you're interested a lot of wonderful work is being done with processing to create physical so if you want to print design I would a checking out the work of Rune Matthiesen and err, course he teaches call Printing Code, there's a tremendous suite of examples of using computation to generate print designs, err, this is a project that Mary Huang made to create a, err, fashion designed through, through a generative process so you can see here, the mouse this is a Processing sketch running with the mouse able to draw over the figure of the human form and that and that what the mouse is drawing is that a mated to geometry, which is used to generate the, the design for a dress and Mary actually created these dresses and physically fabricated them and wore them as well and so a lot of stuff can be is being done processing in terms of, erm take a look at the work at nervous system, I'll include a link to that as well for making jewelry designs you can print stuff you can generate stuff for a maker bot with processing to do 3d printing this is something that you could explore a as an application that you might an idea you might do throughout if you're following along with all these videos also doing a creating a a physical computing interfaces; this is a project called the mud tub um which kinda answers that question what's the thing that you might want to get least near your computer a big pile mud, this is by Tom Gerhard, on and so this is also kind of interesting to say like what you're learning here might not might not need to make something that has this really obvious practical like I wanna make an app, and I wanna like sell billions of them become a zillionaire which actually is would be nice, but you know anyway there's more to life than selling your apps, but err, this you can see here there's a projection on this tub of mud which is the graphics that's being output is done through processing and processing is reading the sensors that are coming back in um from the mud err, there's actually sensors underneath the mud that's measuring the weight of the mud at any point which allows the the software to read the topology essentially of the mud and you can see the mud becomes this controller where you with your hands you can kind bounce this ball around if I kinda skip to the end here you can see you can kinda play this game here on a separate screen by pressing on the mud so this idea of making your own physical computing device your own interface a tub of mud; another great example of this is err the scrollable project; I'll just show you err this is by Filippo Vanucci and you can see here is his processing ah, shoot! which I think, here is his processing sketch which if you look at it, makes this nice ink effect so he's created this a sketch and if I click around here you can see it draws a bunch of dots and it makes this animation that has this ink like quality to it so what did he use this process sketch for? he used it to project onto paper and he built sensors to measure how what that paper's doing. this will become much more obvious when I show you it in a project called scrollables. and you can see these are these devices that you can scroll the paper and I'll just skip ahead here by scrolling back and forth you can control and animation so of course we're all familiar with touchscreens a but here we had this physical device which has real tactile tangible quality. because real paper that you're scrolling and you can see as you scroll back and forth you can play for example the game pong and this ink effect was created through an algorithm in processing and/or a and control through the physical interface so you know this is very very, err, a really really quick and dirty kind of I don't know if I missed anything key that I wanted to show you really kinda quick and dirty, just quick range of projects that were made in Processing. I would also encourage you to on the processing website at to go take a look at the exhibition so if you look at the exhibition link there is a ton of projects that you can see historically you can actually go it's and you can actually go all the way back if on the bottom here oh boy, this is getting awkward at the bottom here if you click on number one you can actually see stuff that was posted for the process exhibition from over 10 years ago so this is there's a if you want to kind of get a sense that the landscape of what this processing do what are the kinds of things that I'm going to learn you could walk yourself through the examples you can look at a bunch of projects that are made with processing but ultimately the rest of these videos are going to very slowly by slowly piece by piece walk you through the fundamentals of programming through a whole lot of graphic examples and processing and that will help you generate ideas and things that you want that you might wanna make and that really well hopefully one more introductory video to make and that is a video where I'm just going to talk through kind of the table of contents everything we're gonna go through you could call it a syllabus if you want to but I'm kind of afraid to do that. so I'm gonna kind of just give you a quick overview I think this I'm kinda having a problem with this is that in the last one to a bit too long so and give you a quick overview all the fundamentals are going to learn and then we're just gonna dive right in and get started
