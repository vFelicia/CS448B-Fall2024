sorry about that little bit of technical difficulties this morning hello I have brought back my train whistle welcome to the coding train a special Saturday morning edition it's kind of like the old days of Saturday morning cartoons only it's Saturday morning coding I'm having a little trouble like actually realizing that I'm here and that I'm livestreaming I'm not entirely sure that I am this building is basically like completely empty actually I don't think it's completely empty just this floor where I have this particular recording studio is empty and it's just it's like so quiet which is a good thing cuz I can be loud and ridiculous but I feel this need to be very quiet so I'm here I'm really excited about some stuff that I want to do today I feel like there must be some important announcements and things for me to talk before I do that just take a moment to breathe maybe read some random numbers oh boy I really need to get progressive lenses I think okay there's a book anymore it's the problem fifteen thousand five hundred and thirty eight seventy one thousand one hundred and sixty nine forty one thousand two hundred sixtyeight fifty four thousand six hundred ninety five alright this that helped me that helped me get centered mellow and think about what it does I want to say so first thing I want to say is that to new experiments will be coming out on the channel soon one is a edited version of the neuro evolution steering car codec challenge that I did and what's gonna be pretty different about that is that project was built over four hours and I'm working on with Matias help a sort of edited version of that where I skip large parts of the coding and just sort of highlight the key parts and then kind of come in and explain the interstitial stuff so that's gonna be a new thing that if that works well then that might allow me to do some live streams where I build a very large complicated project over a long period of time and then able to release like a shorter video about it which is something I've been wanting to do so the ability to watch the full build or the project will never go away it's just that I think it could be useful to the audience for people kind of coming in and entering this world to be able to sort of like see a highlighted version of the project and then if they're interested to revive deeper into it all right so that's what I want to say the camera shutting off also reminded me of something really important which is that this room that I'm in is going to be no more maybe a some next Friday so I might get my last livestream not last livestream no no no no no just last livestream from this physical space next week sometime I'm not a hard percent sure it might be possible that I still have access to this at some point in July but I'm not sure the good news is I'm good finally some day soon this will be really sad the coding train will have a moment where the camera doesn't shut off anymore because I am setting up a new space hopefully with new equipment hopefully with some some little be good and bad to it but the channel might actually go on hiatus for a little while just because of just in order to set up this new space so I'm sort of figuring that out stay tuned but there might not be very there'll be very few or if not it's limited live streams in July and August and then coming back full force with the start of the school year in September but hopefully all this is gonna be good for them the amount of content that I hope and would like to do in the future now a lot of you have been asking for a video about how I set up this livestreaming studio and how it works and how maybe in the hopes of setting up your own or just learning more about it and I'm pleased to tell you that a week or so ago I recorded a session in here with a third camera so the actual live streaming setup and somebody else holding a camera screen capturing everything and I plan to release that as a video at least a document this space this coding trained studio which lets let's let me let you in on a little secret I think I can think I can pull this off of the wall I rise my mouth is probably coming up right to the camera I know why this is really attached to the wall right above the camera ah now I just got hooked onto this is this this has always been about hanging behind the camera this is my hightech solution to remind me to look at you the audience Oh weird stuff all over the place in this room there's like a guitar picked over here all right what's going on ah now now um Thank You Simon for reminding me Simon who is you know so helpful to me if you don't know Simon check out Simon's YouTube channel Simon is one of the most loyal coding trained viewers I don't know if Simon is excited us probably missed a live stream here there when it was like 3 a.m. his time otherwise he's always here all right let's see just taking a peek at the chat it's nice to be here on a Saturday feel so relaxed like what could possibly go wrong so topic wise I'm gonna actually start with building a processing java library because I think for the past year spit the thing I said I would do after the coding challenge and then I just never get to it I'm gonna start with that I'm gonna spend about an hour on that I mean I think building a library will take longer than that but I'm gonna see how far I get in about an hour at least just sort of getting set up and starting that discussion then I will take a break and talk to you about the coding trains livestream sponsor for today brilliant org was actually one of the things I discovered about brilliant that I really love my kit Rises I haven't happened so I spend a lot of time with a subway looking at my phone which I really shouldn't do I should read or just like be one with the New York City but I finally had app and I was like looking through him doing some of the quizzes and stuff on my phone which I thought was like a pretty good productive use of my time versus the other kind of like nonsense I'm I didn't look at my phone so if you're not familiar with brilliant check out brilliant org son you can sign up for free at brilliant work slash coding train that lets you know that lets them know that you found brilliant front of the coding drain which helps me out a little bit which is nice and then there's a lot of free content for example a daily puzzle and I'm gonna come back later and do the daily puzzle for today but there's also a premium subscription which unlocks a lot of other courses of content which I will show you some of later also and the first 200 people to subscribe to that premium content get 20% off so let's see david is asking in the chat will you have content to upload during the hiatus so I sort of thought that's one of the reasons why I did that big data and API score switch I should pull up here and just mentioned I it's mostly complete though so this is a good question I I would like to but I don't know I see TBD TBD what's gonna happen July in August I'm either gonna have content or no content or have live streams are no less dreams or try something different we'll see but there are some ideas for some things that I could do at least have some content on the channel nobody watches the coding training this summer anyway come back to school and they're like Zubair thank you for your super chat a familyfriendly channel I'll accept your I guess the moderate the automatic moderation does not shut off your super chat only because it's a super chat I guess but thank you nice nice Avengers icon does anybody know where I could get a stained glass Avengers stained glass don't ask me why I don't know if I seriously want that uh looking at the chat alright so what I want to do first before I start doing the processing library is show you some of the community contributions that's another thing on my list that I've got to make a video about how to make a community contribution there have been some really awesome ones that have come in so this is the most recent coding challenge incidentally the coding challenge I'm going to do today is the giftwrapping algorithm to create a so what's called a convex hull around a set of points assuming I get to it TBD but this is the most recent coding challenge video if you haven't watched it you can it is a variation on the google chrome a dinosaur game and but using coding train characters and also using a new feature of the ml 5 library which is a machine learning model to recognize certain speech commands and by the way one thing I wanted to mention is a lot of people commented that let me actually go let's go over to that let's just let me just show you what it was and I want to talk about something so this is it here wait I think I have to do I have to click for a yeah up it did work so when I say up it's supposed to jump so a lot of people commented oh this would work better less latency be more accurate with the web speech API and that very well may be true but one thing I want to emphasize about using this particular model and using ml 5 which is built on top of tensorflow j/s is the model is retrieved and run directly here on the clients so your audio is not being sent anywhere it is staying local to your computer when you use the web speech yeah I'm like I guess someone should factchecked me on this but I've almost certain that your audio goes to the cloud and then is turned into text and returned and this is you know I think something that is more that I really like about working with tensorflow j/s and being able to run the models directly in the browser is the data the images the audio doesn't have to be sent to a server anywhere and so there's a little bit of privacy considerations around that which is something that is always important to think about with all of this stuff okay so mine is terrible but let's look at the community contributions and some of them do have sound which is really fun so this first one is unicorn versus this dots by Melvin Abraham shoot I did terribly okay I'm like standing in front of this awesome little less space here I'm terrible at this alright I'm gonna get I'm gonna get a successful one I'm getting better at it alright I think I got two good remember a Cody train is now gaming Jim alright I'm gonna let I love the sound effects I love all the additions the jumping feels much more fluid and intuitive the fonts being used or the coding train fonts this ah fun to see I love the train whistle beginning it's pretty great all right Thank You Melvin drew that's really awesome alright let's go to this dot jumper by Swift potato awesome named Swift potato are you as as always I always forget to this stop just stop just stop all right guess pres I think you to restart as always I always forget to this stop just stop stop just stop and indeed this stop this stop underneath this this stop this stop is not underneath this stop stop stop why is it let's try this one more time as always I always forget to this stop this is kind of sad I don't know what this scroll thing is happening alright audio is a little loud okay thank you for letting me know that I can turn that down is Swift's potato in the chat anyway super fun I love using the I love using this dot song excellent thank you I love the credit here of everything wonderful work super fun ok let's Oh some rough ideas on doing this in 3d so this is pretty interesting this is from DC bruh Chetty Dave / Chetty so this is interesting weave this Lola oh cool look at that so this this is super fun a roller which is like a little cone and is this this is using p5 WebGL which is really surprising to me p5 WebGL has really improved and people have really been on to make projects with it this is really fun to see cool thank you for this awesome work III encourage everyone to check these out and check out the code and there's one more I know Simon Tiger and then also just remind you you can add your own version here it's a little tricky if you've never used github before I might refer you to my git and github playlist but but we I encourage you to join to try you can't break anything you can't do it wrong we will welcome you in to try it to add your own contribution so let's take a look at Simon's improved spawning of trains I love how Simon includes the algorithm here so we can see in mine it was just a picked a random number and then added a new train but it looks like what Simon is also doing here if I understand the algorithm correctly is that there half is sort of like making a minimum distance between the trains so if it picks two in quick succession it won't be allowed to do that because the timer has not gotten it ready to be able to allow the random number to pick the next train so that's great space makes browsers scroll down this is alko's writing if the default is not prevented by the handler so that's probably something that has to be written into the code and you wouldn't notice it if I go back Thank You Simon for that if I go back to this jumper right always forget that this stop it stop it now you wouldn't notice this because the whole page is is there but I usually have it zoomed in a bit forget to this stop space the default behavior space in the browser is to scroll down to the bottom excuse me for a second so thank you for these wonderful community contributions I love them and yeah so let's move on to the next part of our day so let me close out a bunch of these things and I want to talk about this myself a little more space here and then where's my open simplex noise coding challenge let's get this ready okay okay oh boy so Alka is writing I don't know if this came through a swift potato a sweet potato hello a sweet potato is asking is there any way to remove or override that behavior and Alka writes here in our slack channel window dot add eventlistener key press and then the event comes in as the argument and you say event dot prevent default so and al qaida there in the chat lookup event prevent default and david writes I'm working on a dinosaur game for processing that also has birds you have to duck under which is awesome great okay so I think I'm just gonna get started here and I might come back and record some intro e stuff for this but let me just try I imagine this might be a multipart series and we'll see how it goes okay Gama Chu writes I'm watching you live for the first time given to you where are you watching from I always love to hear where people are from and you know just to be a just it's important to be aware I I kind of peek at the chat every once in a while but I don't I don't catch every message I do often look at the chat after the fact and I do read all the comments that people write on the videos scanning through them and if you feel so inclined you can also join as a member or as a patron of the coding train because I'm actually gonna do the recording so green screen recording session hopefully a little later today or else on Monday for members only too for the interstitial stuff for that neuro evolution so if you want to get a link to my Members Only live streams you can do that now again you don't feel you're missing anything those are just kind of some raw recording sessions of me in front of a green screen and all that eventually comes out but if you want to tune in for that a little behind the scene that's what I do that with a smaller audience okay um all right okay okay I don't want to start I'm gonna start this one's this one's for all you processing Java people from the old days let me just check Twitter and make sure nobody's telling me not to do this okay I think I'm good oh all right let's let's see if I've got a whiteboard going I do not no whiteboard yep okay that's good do I have a marker is the question ah welcome new member matheus Acevedo Oliveira thank you you have made the lights blink at my apartment in Brooklyn I'm not there right now but the lights are blinking train whistle for you by the way I had this idea so I know I shouldn't get off on these random tangents but I just do I have been really struggling to keep up with the rewards that people get for signing up as a YouTube member or a patron which are stickers or books so I'm really really trying hard to get some new systems in place and have all that cleaned up over the summer if you're someone waiting for something I sincerely apologize and you should continue continuously bug me about it you shouldn't apologize for it you can just bug me about it but I have this idea of creating this came up at the i/o conference of creating a coding Train branded like laser etched train whistle because that's the thing people want right so I could like order these in bulk and then I could laser laser etched them with the coding train logo or something and then those could be a thing that I mailed to people and then I think will be easier to do I suppose I could sign them also I don't know if anyone cares about that but the books are just like hard to mail crazy expensive it just doesn't if I have to it's not working out very well but if you signed up and you were promised one you must get one otherwise my old world ups the sense of the way the universe works will not be aligned it will bother me I will lose so many nights of sleep so please keep me posted all right putting down this if we have some time later solve the cube you'll see my progress still just basically doing beginners method but I can do the cross without having to put it on the yellow side first I mean that's not that hard yay for me all right we've got a whiteboard we've got this I'm going to start so um let's see let's see how far I get in approximately a half an hour or 45 minutes and then I want to take a break and look at that brilliant Daly puzzle and then either do more of the library stuff or move on to some talking about computational geometry of this unbranded coffee cup from a not a sponsor water has really let me down by the way these days I have no water come on back to me come on back to me with that great water h2o sponsorship let's get the slack channel up here all right hello and welcome to a new series about building a processing library in Java so if we've ever wanted to learn a little more about Java programming and how opensource works and how you can contribute your own code through times a library to some other platform this is the place for you and I have to admit like I really don't know how everyone does it say I have this like really nervous tic I wonder if this is like some kind of genetic condition where when I start teaching or livestreaming it never Li like nose becomes very itchy then like I feel like I need to scratch it or below my nose it's like what it's like a nerves thing all right I started working with processing in 2003 which is some number of years ago it's too many years ago I can't possibly do that math and one of the things that I first did when working with processing was contribute libraries to it and you can see here I'm scrolling through the processing libraries page there are libraries for all sorts of categories I'm just gonna go under video for a second oh no that's the actual video library sorry there are libraries for there are libraries for all sorts of categories I'm just gonna go here under video invision for example and we'll see there's a library for using like the PSI camera for doing a open CV oh look at this one for the connector it's really not kept up to date um there's a lot of wonderful libraries your blob detection this is a really useful one I have some videos about doing blob detection processing with your own code but you could use a library for it so maybe you've used processing maybe you've used a library before how would you make your own library this is what this video is about or this is what this video series is about alright so let's see what am I going to say next I have to admit something to you I have not actually done any research or practice before I'm beginning this right now I have made processing libraries but I haven't really made one in a while so a lot of this series will also be me sort of figuring it out as I go and hopefully everything works just fine it's somewhat of an ancient medieval art to build a Java a compilation of Java classes to insert as a processing library and I'm a lot of the stuff that you notice I've been doing is JavaScript on the channel these days but maybe after I do this I'll come back and show you how to make your own JavaScript library as well Matias is asking who edits the videos and that is Matthew who is a video editor and and more based in Montreal Canada okay all right so the very first thing that we need to do is go to the processing library template under the processing github organization and you'll notice something it actually says template here and there's this little button here use this template this is a new feature of github I don't know how to do it is I mean it's been there for a while but I've actually never used this feature up until right now mostly when you're using a github repo you're cloning it which means you're what I want to say stop beeping at me this extra computer here mostly when you're using this should probably be like I don't know I'm so confused these days cuz I now i do the offline recording with the AMA whatever I'm just gonna keep going this is what I'm doing now mostly when you a lot of times we're gonna use in github maybe you're just trying to find some code and you're clicking around you copy and paste it or maybe you're even ambitious enough to clone or download so cloning is a process of taking this repository and cloning it's a to another to your local computer your laptop I'm actually gonna do that a little bit later in this video downloading would just be downloading the code there's this process of forking a repo which is kind of creating a version of it that is linked back to the original version but this is a scenario this is a rare scenario where what I want to do is build an entirely new project it's not really related to this it's related to this in that this is my starting point but there's no reason for what I want to build to be a fork of the template because I am not contributing back to the template if there's an issue with something wrong in the template then I would want to make a fork to fix the thing that's in the template but I just want to start from it it was a very long explanation for me just basically pressing this button so I'm going to press this button I'm actually gonna switch this to coding train because I would like this library that I make to be a community project that people could submit to and I mean I could do that under shipment as well but this is a coding training process library we're going to call this open simplex noise library I'll call it for processing let's call it for processing so that's going to be the name of the repository this is a new a processing or open simplex noise and I want to make it public and I want to create the repository from the template so I love this I love that this is a new repository a new project but github is being thoughtful about this and crediting back where it was generated from now what is the next step the next step is now I want to work with this and update the code and change it around and put my stuff my open simplex noise stuff in it and by the way you might be wondering what is open simplex noise so I have a whole video about what that is it's not really important right now the point is how to make the library but I want to make it in the context of something that would be useful so I'll come back and talk more about open simplex noise and we'll look at some examples with it as we get a little further along all right so I'm gonna click clone I'm gonna copy this and I'm gonna open up let me let me let me be more picks up about this right all right I'm gonna click clone I'm gonna copy this and I'm gonna go to my console application which I'm using I term and I must say git clone and paste that in so this is now going to and this should be bigger let's try this one more time so I'm gonna click clone I'm gonna copy this I'm gonna go to my terminal application I'm just in the desktop and I would say git clone and I'm going to clone this particular repo which will now download everything to my computer I'm just gonna then open up that repo oh no I'm not I'm not I was about to open up that repo and I'm doing it right now in Visual Studio code which would be fine because then I could kind of like look at like what's in there there's like a hello library Java template and stuff but no no close all this this is not what I want this is a very momentous occasion this might be the first time I need to use a Java development environment I'm sure there's some magical way I could make Visual Studio code do what it is I want to do but I want to do this with a Java development environment namely eclipse yeah alka this is pretty new I just turned it on because I had been privileged alka is saying they've never seen the template repo before and I just turned it on in because I have admin privileges of the processing organization and I hope it was okay that I did that all right now I don't even know if if I've downloaded eclipse I didn't CD into the repo I now oh shoot everything's going wrong now cameras shutting off IntelliJ right nobody nobody wants me to use in TIG I don't know I never used IntelliJ before in my life so I feel like I have to use eclipse eclipse.org Intelli IntelliJ I'll pull that up this is the Eclipse Foundation website where you can download and install Eclipse I'm gonna do that in a moment I should mention also that a lot of people the chat are saying oh use IntelliJ I like that better than Eclipse I don't know maybe it is better maybe it's worse who knows who cares I'm just gonna use eclipse it's the only one I've ever used and I want to have at least one thing here that I don't have to learn that's new but maybe I can come back and show IntelliJ at some point or one of you can make your own video about doing the same thing with IntelliJ and I can link to it alright so let's download eclipse so I'm gonna lift down let's download eclipse I'm gonna get this most latest version I'm gonna download the 64bit this link looks good eclipse much like processing is a nonforprofit foundation and you can donate actually I don't know if they're nonprofit they seem there I should try it once to form your yes it definitely should what's what's going on here all right clips installer oops hold on Ola oh I guess I'm doing it alright once you've downloaded it you're gonna get this Eclipse installer and then you've got to choose what you want here I want Eclipse IDE for Java developers I think that's what I'm doing so I'm going to install it here hit accept and here we go it was fast except let me IntelliJ IDEA communities free and open source that's good to know all right I've downloaded installed it I'm gonna launch it now I also should mention that I think the processing library template is designed for use with eclipse it's creating a workspace which is similar to like a processing sketch book Welcome is great and I'm just going to do this open it up alright let's see alright alright here we go I have eclipse now now I'm gonna have to do some work to like fix the font sizes I realize if you're watching this you can barely see anything but right now I'll just use zoom for a second and what I want these are my options I could create a new project a Java project a project but what I want to do I pretty sure is import a project so I'm gonna click on import and then these are all of my options oh look at this it even asked like a git so I actually could probably import it from git but I think I can just do general existing I think this is what I want I think I want existing project into workspace because the processing library template is an existing Eclipse project so then I'm gonna hit next and I want to find that directory which is just on my desktop called open simplex open simplex noise for processing I'm gonna hit open and you can see look at that Oh interesting it's called processing library template so there's probably somewhere that there's like a name for it that I might want to rename not gonna worry about that too much right now I'm just going to click now finish finish and okay there we go this is looking promising oh I have a red X but you can see now this is an eclipse project it's got all of the files here in this like directory tree there's a data folder and examples folder a live folder a resources folder I may have to get into what's in those things but the most important one right now is the source folder I'm going to click on that and we're gonna see like this is really this is the Java file it's not a PDE file not a processing development environment file it's an actual proper Java file this is what the file that I'm gonna need to work with is there a dark mode for eclipses by holing people are telling me there's a dark mode let's look for that appearance No I'm looking the chat has not told me where it is yet and I haven't found it all right let's Google I guess that's from 2014 that's not gonna help me preferences general appearance okay ah theme what's not about okay oh great let me quickly mention that under the preferences under general appearance you can change the theme to dark mode which I'm doing right now get the font size wear with the font size be you think we'll be under appearance colors and fonts oh there we go oh my god this is like insane whoa seriously okay does that actually change it that didn't seem to do anything this text sounds use by text editors let's see okay that's good so at least I got the font bigger for the text editor Java editor text font under Java click Java editor okay I think I've got that I think I'll leave the rest of the fonts small I've also gone this will this is not enough something necessary you'll need to do but I've also gone and increased the font size for the code editor just so we can see it bigger so where I am right now is I have got I'm looking at hello library job I'm looking at this code and I'm in the Eclipse editor so the next thing that I want to do here is I'm gonna figure out why do I have these errors I know why all right interesting interesting oh this is exciting this is very exciting these are the errors P applet cannot be resolved to a type the import processing cannot be resolved why do I have these errors well the idea that this project where I'm building a processing library depends on the processing core library itself and I don't have that anywhere on my computer yes I have the processing application so maybe there's some way for me to link this to the processing application but I'm gonna do you one better what I'm going to do is I'm now going to clone the entire processing sort core library source code and I'm going to have that as a project in Eclipse and I'm gonna have this project refer to that so let's look at how I would do that pretty sure by the way there's probably some instructions for how to do this let's look for that for a second Oh rename your Eclipse project okay oh yeah oh I see so I could just get cored out jar I think I'd rather have the full all right I think so this oh by the way so this we can now change butts by the anyone who wants to submit a pull request to processing library to change these instructions because you no longer need to do fork you can you use as a template which makes so much more sense and that can be fixed but let's not I'm not gonna worry about that right now I'm just gonna mention alright before I do this next step I should point out that even though I'm kind of haphazardly no absolutely is not the right word before I go on to the next step I should point out that women before I go into the next step I should point out that even though I'm like awkwardly trying to figure this out as I go there is a guide to how to do this that's part of the processing library template readme and the step that I'm on right now actually is this ad core jar or in other jar files to your class path so one way that you could do this is just to get core jar what is quart jar it is the entire processing core library packaged into a single file a jar file is like a zip file of all of these provident to one but I'm gonna do this in a slightly different way which i think is interesting I don't know if it's better or worse which is to instead of adding quart jar to the classpath I'm going to add the processing source code project to the class path that way if I need to I can actually poke around that as well so to do that I'm going to go to nice little edit point here I'm going to I'm going to go to the processing main processing repo itself I'm gonna grab this clone I'm gonna copy that I should point out that you I should also mention I should also mention that I and using SSH meaning I've already gone through some instructions for how to set up an SSS ASIS meaning I've already gone through some instructions of how to set up an SSH key on my computer to authenticate to github automatically you could do this more simply by just using HTTP me I should really make a video on how to do that somebody remind me someday but that's why this is working for me so automatically okay so I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna go back oops sorry cancel I'm gonna go back to go back to my terminal I'm gonna say git clone the hope the full processing library get to that Orange Julius I like to call it Orange Julius I hurt myself there wow this is really taking a long time see the double X 47 and 65% type sense there we go all right now that I've cloned that repo I can go back to eclipse I'm gonna say file import existing projects into workspace you can see that's what I'm doing again next browse back to the desktop processing open and uh okay so do I really need all of these great idea so these are all of the processing projects that are part of the core processing repo let's try for right now just processing core I'm pretty sure that's the only one that I need is a dependency to build my processing library so I'm gonna uncheck all the others I'm gonna hit finish it's there so now we can see I have processing core with an X all right let's see so before it's gonna work as a dependency for processing library template this can't have any errors in it so let's see what happens here oh so there's an issue with I should have just gotten cored a jar if you with with the Java FX renderer that you can see how that's the entire error what's think different Java there's so many little like Easter eggs inside the processing source code processing Java FX so Java FX is missing is this because of the version of Java that I'm using Nathan is asking why is the processing repo more than a gig I will get back to you on that I should probably just go back to the core dot jar thing would be considered clear not jar it would I be done in two seconds I should probably follow the instructions but I do want to fix this Java FX why don't I have Java FX so I have to like install that separately okay Oh install new software okay that's not so bad let's try that it's not anymore included I am using Java 8 I'm pretty sure I need to use the correct version of Java with processing but I think that I am set a path all right let's try this I think I think that I found the issue here which is that Java FX which is something that processing uses is not by default included in the version of Java that I'm running with eclipse and so what I need to go now is to help install new software I assume that I could just search Java FX No ok [ __ ] already blue we find that we install new software and you're EFX Eclipse where do I add it did I not get help it's all new software yeah that's right yeah work with well there's a dropdown oh there's a dropdown gfx eclipse is in the marketplace the FX eclipse is in the marketplace this is so it's like the tiniest font ever I can barely read it select a site so there's like a marketplace it clips markup like okay there we go okay that's good all right let's write this so I can actually just go to eclipse marketplace in under find I can type FX and this is what I want e FX eclipse and let's let's try installing that how do i I don't like tell whether it was installed or not what version of processing am I using I mean if Java Java 12 I don't know what that is SE oh yes oh it installed okay all right restart now oh well that's bad having me when it finishes installing will ask you to restart eclipse which is what I'm doing and I can see that everything is totally working now did it install I think I might have to go back to the core jar no updates found yeah I might have to go back to my core jar JavaFX is not provided in Java 12 wait I should be using Java 8 for processing does it say on the processing library template Oh Oh I just need to add this I need to explicitly add it let me just see if that fixes it it didn't fix it Java SE 1.8 that's what I want don't I need like a JDK or something hold on let's see but I'm following this maybe I need to make sure I have the JDK downloaded f5 would refresh everyone's time I should be using IntelliJ no I'm gonna use eclipse I used two Clips fifteen years ago and it's what I'm going to use now let's see soon as it gives me a little ffive I don't have the functions anymore that's a ridiculous Mac I should just go to import core jar we'd be done with this nonsense hold on let's go to is this what I want do I want this do I need this Java that's there no matter our projects libraries I'll let them move on from this soon let me do this hold on all right I'm going back to court jar I got rid of the arrows in like two seconds all right this was like a cool idea so that I could look in the processing source code but it's so not necessary don't let's just not do this I'll come back to this another time all right I'm just gonna do the quart jar I'm head beans I'm gonna just do the core jar solution so I'm gonna go back to where I was here it would get edited back I was trying to be ambitious and I'll look into that later so nathan is suggesting that we redo the processing template to use IntelliJ I think actually a contribution of a version of the template for IntelliJ would be great and that would probably be something that would be accepted or at least could be pointed to so if you're interested I would say rather than replace it although I could imagine maybe in the longterm sense maybe it makes sense but for as a first step would be to just create a duplicate version of it all right but nobody goes maven or great all I know look I can only do what I can do all right P applet cannot be Oh November hello my kind of the Kadesh key which i'm sure i pronounced that completely incorrectly but I sort of tried to do it with some kind of vague accent to make it seem like I knew what I was doing but clearly I did not all right errors yeah I gotta wait till people stop talking about the camera errors P applet cannot be resolved to a type the import processing cannot be resolved to a tight so this is because this particular project means as a dependency the processing core library itself so there are a couple different ways that I could tell this project my processing library about the processing core library and I'm going to show you the easiest way to do that right now I should mention however that all of this was I should mention however that all of this all of what I'm awkwardly kind of stumbling through is actually here as instructions on the readme and the step that I'm looking to do right now is adding core jar or other jar files to your class path so the idea of a class path is a very important concept in Java programming it is the path where all of your dependencies live all of the classes that your project depends on live the path to your classes the class path so the way that the what I want to find is core jar that's a bundle jar file it's like a zip file that has all of the processing Java classes in it and there's a variety of different ways that I can find it but if I happen to have processing installed on my computer on the Mac and you can find this similarly on a Windows or Linux I can actually just right click on here and go to show package contents because whoops right click on here and go to show package contents a java application is actually just a directory of files it's kind of the operating system is hiding that for you but I can go here under Java and look at this core jar now I might find that I need other dependencies eventually but right now I just want core jar so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy that into my project just by dragging it over I'm just gonna put it in the root directory maybe there's a better place to put I could link to the file huh maybe I should just link to the file copy link what should I do people welcome new member or long Nellis Sanchez thank you let me I'm gonna have some fancy stuff with buttons and little things will go off I said ROM now it's rommel sorry about that I'm gonna copy it should I copy it or link it excuse me well that was a burp house very thick copy all right there might be different reasons why you might want to do one or the other I'm gonna stick with copy just so that I know it comes in so I can see cordage are is there I still have my errors though but what I want to do now is I'm gonna rightclick core jar and I'm gonna go to build path build path is essentially another sort of term for class path and I want to add this to the build path I'm gonna click Add to the build path and then voila all of those errors go away it knows what p applet is because P applet is part of processing core P applet is the base class for every sketch you write in processing yes I like by the way how the first person to answer in the chatter just said copy I took as words like that's that's crucial that's to keep that's the answer alright just to did these phase that just to did why the heck are we into clubs all the time probably not in ten years but there's some sort of like warmth that's filling my heart about this right now I just love it okay we're almost finished this first part now I'm just about ready to actually start doing the coding of the library itself this first part was really just to set up the project itself but I want to do a few more cleanup things number one is it shouldn't be called processing library template so I'm going to right click here and go to refactor rename and I'm gonna change the new name to open simplex noise for processing what else let's see let's see what else it says here add external jars oh I should put it in lives this okay well I think I got another new member just again another new member I already thanked this member yeah at Roma I think I think okay we're just done I'm about done with this first step okay looking more closely at the instructions I've discovered actually that the point of this Lib folder is this is where other dependencies should go so I'm actually just gonna move this chord jar file into there I think the project oh now it's complaining at me so you should have copied it in there in the first place but now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to right click on the project go to build path configure build path and this is now it's confused this project this chord out jar file is now missing so I'm gonna hit edit no no no nno I'm not gonna edit I'm gonna hit remove and then I'm gonna do apply and close then I'm going to just go back to this and go to build path and add back to the build path okay so now I have my project setup hmm there's now I have my project set up there are a few last remaining steps we need we want to get to the point where I can build the library I want to see the build successful message and I'll be done with this first video in this series so what I need to actually do is I need to look for a file called build dot properties and this is going to be in the resources folder of the Java project so let's go back to eclipse go here under resources build dot properties that's what I want there oh I have never seen anything like this what I'm so confused so this to me in my head has always just been a text file does anybody know how I can change the font size of all of this stuff what's that telling me to change one through four well what are the items one through four now I don't want you to do this no idea I've never seen this before so this is like a GUI for the build up properties but where's all the stuff panel build ah there we go all right thank you so it appears that Eclipse has added a GUI for build properties but I'm actually just gonna click here so I can look at the actual text file and this is this is this is important so where is my processing sketchbook I'm going to open up processing to make sure this is right I'm gonna go to Processing's preferences and we can see users coding training documents processing that's where the sketchbook is great that's user home documents processing okay class path local location applications processing app now again you're going to have a different location oh I can also do this oh I should just I see I can link to this project all right so don't try to thing this is the next setting that I need to make sure is correct so this needs to point to that core jar file the processing the processing core library itself so I could get to it you know in Windows it's sort of like showing me how I might find it I could get to it from this Eclipse project the path of this Eclipse project and the libs directory which I think makes would make sense like documents Eclipse workspace is that a thing hmm where's the Eclipse workspace oh no but it's it's actually this project is o is here okay is there okay users this is the next item that I need to make sure points to the right location I want to find this core jar file the processing core library so I could actually point to where the processing application is actually saved on my computer if I had it in the applications directory which I might actually happen to have it here on my desktop so this would have to change or I can actually give it a direct location in this case I can actually just tell it I'm gonna tell it user home on the desktop is this particular project whoops so let's go sorry let's go here I'm gonna say PWD whoops PWD so this is actually where it is I'm gonna grab this directory and then in that directory under Li BS for libraries that or no it's just Li be sorry Li be for Lib library that is let me do that again I don't know why I'm obsessing over this okay this is the next setting that I need to change and I need to make sure it points to the processing core libraries to spend a lot of effort getting that core dot jar file into my project so now I also need to point from build properties so the variety places I could point to the processing application which for me is on the desktop but it might be in your Applications folder so many different on Windows or Linux I think for me what might actually be easiest is just to comment this out and point to where the actual this actual project is so this actual project is here on my desktop desktop open simplex for noise processing so I can put that in here paste that here then there's a file called lib for library where core dot jar is not a file directory so I should just put that in here and hit save that's good classpath local include core jar and then class path libraries location is sketchbook that location library so all this is the same target version 1.8 that should be fine all this stuff is fine a project name I suppose more stuff I should change so I'm just gonna say open simplex noise I'm gonna say open simplex noise for processing this is not super important I can fix this I can fix this stuff up later but let's just do some of this right now and I don't have a URL yet and there's categories let's just put it in other I'm actually is there a math math I'm doing all these now all right I'm gonna fix this up later I'm gonna put the rest of these but you could see that there's lots of other things there's that I can put in here but I'm gonna leave this all out I'm gonna hit save and I'm gonna go to the next step all right the next step is to compile the library using ant what is ant ant is from Apache ant or Apache ant is basically a build system for a Java it's maybe somewhat ancient but it's what's used by the processing library template so if I go back to eclipse and somewhere up here there should be like a little ant icon there it is I think that's ant write this up here is the ant and no that's debug that's the debug mode that's not the ant oh maybe I go to build that XML you go to build an XML let's look at the instructions window show view ant ah so to be able to see ant I need to go to window show view and you can see the little icon of the ant let's click that and now I should have somewhere where's my ant ant Apache where are you Oh ant now I see it drag the resources build an XML file there okay the next step is to take this build that XML file and drag it over to here and we can see there it is processing library open simplex noise for processing and I clean click this and do run ass ant build run as ant build okay now we say a little prayer to the ant God and we run that we built the processing library build successful look at this having to open up processing I'm gonna go to sketch import library okay I think I need to restart processing I'm gonna launch processing I'm gonna go to sketch import library look at this open simplex noise for processing the library is there now it's saying import template that library and there's no code for me to actually use but I now have the processing library building and I can start writing the code so in a way this was really the hardest part the next stuff that I want to do is going to be quite simple by comparison it's really just adding the code out of the examples building the library and publishing it so that will come in the next video or two or three and I'll see you there thanks for watching this we built a processing java library alright alright everyone that took a little bit longer than I had hoped and now at the halfway point of today's live stream this is the part where I talk to you about brilliant the sponsor of the coding train live streams and do a daily puzzle from brilliant ok so what is brilliant but first let me go to the web I'm going to close all these links and I am going to go to brilliant org so this is brilliant I mentioned earlier to when I started that brilliant also has an app that I've started using I'm a little bit afraid to plug my phone and show you the app because I don't know what sort of strange notifications or text message log yet but I'll figure out a way to do that I know I can turn on Do Not Disturb and all that so maybe next time for the next live stream I'll try to show you the app itself but I've been using it a lot on a subway when I have extra time instead of the other nonsense that I get involved with on my phone so I think I want to try that I'm just gonna try whatever the first daily challenges but I wanna show you a few things about brilliant that's pretty exciting so one thing is Simon Simon loyal coding trained viewers Simon Tiger sent me a message says I have a present for you I was like whoa I'm so excited and it has to do with this so as you know I have a special affinity for polar coordinates and I have a lot of videos and coding challenge witches are all themed around just doing stuff with polar coordinates and things like the cardioid shape polar flowers more flowers pull her problem solving so I haven't actually gone through I wanted to show this to you without me clicking through it this is part of the premium brilliant subscription I'm so the but they have these extra quizzes and courses themed around different geometry topics math topics so for me what's really wonderful about this stuff now as I'm kind of running out of ideas for what coding challenges to do that I can kind of go through these quizzes it's interactive learning it kind of keeps me fresh and then I get ideas to build coding challenges and in fact one of the reasons why I'm about to do a coding challenge on computational geometry is because of this quiz that I found on brilliant all about computational geometry and there's a section here on convex hull so this is actually what I want to do is in the a little bit later in today's livestream is look at an algorithm for calculating a convex hull around a collection of points so I'll talk about more what that is but I can click on it you can see there's some more stuff about that here okay but what's probably most relevant and what I've been looking at are the computer science fundamentals and computer science algorithms courses so I'm going to be doing these courses over the summer and and thinking of ideas for coding challenges and if you do that stuff too please share it with me so let's do a daily puzzle um these are free so all you have to do is sign up at brilliant org slash coding trained there's that URL for nowhere so let's go to today and let's go to this which is larger all right so what I like to do is I like to recreate the diagrams in p5 because why not I don't know how hard this one will be but let's let's let's let's read through it a little bit together okay and I'm probably gonna need the whiteboard is the whiteboard camera on No all right let's look at this in the figure below can we relate the areas of the various regions so there's a light green dark green and blue region the legs of the right triangle or the radii of this larger semicircle which is the hypotenuse which while the hypotenuse is the diameter of the smaller semicircle I hold on I need to recreate this diagram I can't see it over there I'm just gonna go over here and draw it while I can see it okay and then I'll come back over here so we have our our da1 circle and then another circle I didn't do that didn't draw that very well not drawn to scale my drawing is terrible that's my drawing oh god it's the worst right but you get the idea okay so what are we trying to compute we're trying to compute the area of the smaller semicircle little R which is what the area of the smaller semi circle is PI R squared I don't get it the larger semicircle are the diameter of the semicircle D right but what is what's little R I don't get it little R is just half of little D must be right this makes sense because PI R squared divided by 2 huh we're there RDR the side lengths of the right triangle so R squared plus R squared equals d squared Oh since D equals to R we can substitute and simplify as follows I still understand what lo little oh yes to our little door is that ok so which semicircle am I looking for it this one that would just be this is the radius for that one that would just be PI big R squared right so oh I get it I think so right so if I'm looking for this region this is going to be PI big R squared divided by two because R divided by the whole circle is PI R squared so actually that's PI big R squared divided by four right that would be the area of this I think when we're trying to figure out is what's the area of this right and so the area of that is if if that's the radius it's okay hi little R squared divided by two I get that now and what is little R squared if we know this little R squared R squared plus R squared equals d squared so D equals the square root of R squared plus R squared which is this divided by two which is the square root of 2r squared divided by two that's what R is and so then I now can say I could plug this in right I can plug this into little R squared so little R squared this is the bottom is going to be for the top is going to be 2 R squared I multiplied by PI this becomes 2 pi big R squared divided by 2 is the area of this is that right the reai I scanned over this on the subway I didn't actually try to calculate it because I know the question is now so we go to the challenge is how does the oh I'm over here how does the combined area of the 4 orange this is called a lune by the way so this is special kind of shape called a loon it's like a half circle with another part cut out of it I would really like to draw this but I think it's kind of like a pretty pattern each side of the square is the diameter of the semicircle so the question is how does the combined area of the four orange loons compared to the green area inside the square okay I don't know if people will know any of the chat is yelling me like I've done something horribly wrong yet I usually get this stuff wrong which is the way to learn is to get it wrong you can get it right eventually or not you just learn through getting it wrong over and over again which is kind of my life all right so let me draw this diagram so I think I can see it on this computer I think I can figure this out so we've got one big blue circle this is really the same diagram I'm drawing again this is the blue circle and then we put a square in there so this is really this is this is the same as what's there and then we make these four looms which again I haven't really drawn to scale so okay so if this is we're gonna call this R right so the area of the square the blue square would be oh wait this is the area of the square is the side length times the size like so the side length is the square root of 2r squared right we already established that right the side length of that square which is this R squared plus R squared equals D d squared and then if I take that times that this side the area of the square sorry its 2r squared 2r squared that's the area of the square right we did that before oh you're over here okay now if the looms area is this we have four of them for know where is it over here we have four of them well there's a PI in there I don't have a PI in here for orange some is PI R squared I know that's although this camera went out right I did this whole calculation before and I've already forgotten oh wait a second hold on I have to start over here I hope start over here let me start over here for a second the area of this loon is half of the side length oh my god I've lost my mind here I forgot which one which where's my final answer anybody know I'm like panicking this is what how does he try to do math while you're live streaming and you're really oh you're doing let's start over I'm gonna do this in tandem all right we're going to say I'm just gonna do this that this is our known length our so this area here all right this area here is oh I see what's gonna happen this area here is PI big R squared divided by 4 it's the subtracting out that I kind of got confused now this this area here right this triangle area right so this is this this Triangle area is 2r no I'm sorry R squared divided by 2 so this little area here is this full area minus R squared divided by 2 which would be 2 R squared divided by 4 which is PI R squared minus 2 R squared divided by 4 right reason why I want to find out this little area is because then once I find out this area I can then subtract that out I don't think I'm doing this right somebody help me area of small circle divided by 2 equals area of big circle divided by 4 I need colors oh yeah I should get colors let's get some colors okay whoo this is fun okay purple so this triangle here is purple this area here is pink oops and this I should really use oh I should be using the same colors as in this in the brilliant diagram no it should be applauding but it's too late I'm using my own colors then this area is green so that area there is this is what's called the lube so basically what I want to know is what is the area of one loon I want to multiply that by four and then I want to compare that to the full area of this this whole this whole square which obviously now is if this is R squared divided by two then the whole thing is just 2 R squared there's four of them all right so let me look let's look back at the explanation for a second you need to add the two circle areas and then subtract the Triangle area oh yeah let's let me go back to here because that's giving me a nice little proof here that it's once to give me oh right I forget I don't have to get the area of the loon I don't need to worry about the triangle because oh you don't see what I'm doing to get the area of the loon oh this is so silly I'm so silly I knew I was doing I knew I did this right the first time if I just have the area of this I'm so silly so hold on I have my colors what colors do I need pink I don't actually need to know this area of the pink right because what matters to me oh no that's not true right the purple segment is a right triangle yes it is a right triangle the pink segment is called a segment it's a segment no I do need that okay I do so let me do this again I can conquer this I could conquer this I'm feeling feeling good about it okay I'm gonna need everybody to help me for a second first tell me that this is correct the area of this purple right triangle is our whoops R squared divided by two right this is this area that's correct right then so then the area of this quarter circle with a radius of R is PI R squared divided by four is that correct so the radiant then if I want the segment this what I want is this whole thing PI R squared divided by 4 minus the right triangle R squared divided by 2 so this is really this total area do I have this right am i right so far Leonardo is writing you can find the answer adding the square area and the areas of the semi circles oh you know I could make this easier you're right I don't need to do this in this quarter thing okay I I could do it as the whole thing but yes okay okay so I'm doing it in a in a bit of a okay so people are telling me I've gotten this much right okay so now let's get the green area so now what I'm going to do is look at this this circle let me get the black pen for a second this half circle which has this little R right I'm gonna call this half of the hypotenuse of this right triangle little R we know that little art that so and if the whole thing we're D D equals D equals the square root of 2r squared right I did that before that's what that done so little R then equals that divided by two so now this green area that's the full half circle equals PI little R squared divided by 2 so if little R is this this turns into PI 2r squared divided by 4 divided by 2 so I can actually just cancel out the twos I don't like the way that I wrote this I'm it's got an easier way to think about this for my brain which is hurting right now is just multiply this by 1/2 so so this is 2r squared over 4 divided by times 1/2 which and these cancel out so PI big R squared divided by 4 so that is the area of this whole green thing so if I take this whole thing I look at this and then subtract this we're left with this being the lunes area right PI R square by 4 minus this this turns into a plus these cancel out we just have R squared divided by 2 so the lunes area according to this calculation is big R squared divided by 2 and now for the for the grand finale we now get to say the looms area is R squared divided by 2 so 4 of them for R squared divided by 2 is 2 R squared and now write the area of the square is also that cuz remember a quarter of it is R squared divided by 2 multiply it by 4 to R squared the answer is they're equal they're equal they're equal they're equal alright we're going to now go here and we say the areas are equal you can hit submit oh yeah all right now let me find my phone and take a picture of the white board and submit that normally I I'm low on I would love to like code this and then I thought would be fun it was actually like code this event count the pixels to sort of like prove that it's correct which is not really a way to prove it count the pixels of different colors but I don't know where I put my phone to take this is silly why I don't need to use my phone I just take a screenshot of this and somebody screenshot okay I know how to do it you go to here and go to here it's correct which is not really a way to prove that I'm behind count the pixels of different colors but I don't know where I put my phone I think this is silly why I don't need to know don't phone oh there we go I just take a screenshot of this all right we're gonna take a screenshot of this should I be in it oh I'm not in it I've just seen it over there okay and we will copy this video URL I'm gonna add this image which should be this screenshot I'm pretty sure God well we make sure that's the right screenshot could there be another screenshot and then let's go to here what's that please add a link to your sketch let's do preview okay let's do edit because this should be a link wonder if it's a way to like insert a YouTube video right is there a way to I'm not gonna worry about that let's go to preview it's got the link to the video and I'm gonna post it alright thank you for humoring me to watch me struggle through a little math problem I you typically I like to tie these to a p5.js sketch but I'm gonna leave that as a challenge to you the viewer to make a p5.js sketch that draws this shape maybe you can animate it maybe you can you can add some kind of extra explanation you can share it with me in the comments thread here if you don't have a brilliant account you can sign up at brilliant org slash coding train you can actually do that right now cuz I'm gonna take a five minute break and I'm gonna come back and I think I'm gonna try to do I would I didn't get super far with the processing Java library but I think I might leave it there for today so that I could do the computational geometry coding challenge so I have a coding challenge ready to go and so I'm gonna come back and do that so I need a five minute break to actually like get some water recenter myself read some random numbers let me solve this Rubik's Cube and then I will be back so I'm going to I'm just gonna leave this here and I'm gonna throw caution to the wind I'm going to eliminate myself nope there we go you don't see me I'm about to mute my microphone and sign up at the link above and I'll be back in about five minutes one of these days all have a nice by the way one's an animator out there and wants to help make some animations for like starting soon technical difficulties get in touch get in touch with me on twitter at Schiffman i'm that might be someone I'm something that I'm looking for someone to help make for coding trade okay um and I'll be back in about five minutes mute the microphone as always I always forget this dog this doc never forget the good stuff I'm gonna do this stuff this stock this dog the starter this start song never forget the Vista I'm gonna say once again coordinates Cartesian coordinates and autotune and the internet will fix that for me coordinates it's Cartesian coordinates okay I'm back in zero minutes in negative one minutes let's save this very important file now let's just leave this one all right thanks everyone let's see did anybody add anything but wait I lost my chute I think I met I meant to do is click on it here we go oh come on people still zero helpful zero interesting zero brilliant there's no least be a lot of confused I should probably link to the actual time code where I do it but all right I will check this later I guess I can't link to kind of link to this comment directly all right that helped me out people I need some emojis alright okay okay we're quitting this yes exit we are going to back to the browser we are going to log in as the coding code it will are right there we go we're gonna go here set this up to 32 I think is what I tend to do gift wrapping convex hull it's gonna be the coding challenge for tape you know what I'm gonna do just give me a second here I'm gonna start with some boilerplate code okay all right oh so thanks again to brilliant for sponsoring this livestream I encourage you to check out brilliant if you have some time I am now going to move on to the cue the theme music for coding challenges I don't have one I'm working on I'm gonna move on to today's coding challenge so I will return back to that processing library tutorial I don't think there's actually a tremendous amount more for me to do but I'll I'll have to return to that next week I'm glad that at least got that started there's a little momentum there but I don't want to leave today even though it's now time for me to go because it's already been over two hours but I don't want to leave today without doing a coding challenge and so I'm really gotten recently interested in computational geometry and the camera went off I know I know you don't have to say in the chat you don't say in the chat I know it's off I know it's off I am going to oh I'm definitely gonna need the whiteboard I'm gonna go to here I'm gonna go to the lawn I'm gonna search for delante I think that's how you spell it must not be how you spell oh yes it is oh wow there's so many let's go to this first one yeah so this was suggested de l'année trail because I'll I'm gonna maybe I'll just start and I'll explain what I'm gonna do so hold on a second everybody giftwrapping algorithm let's go here we're gonna need the crossproduct I need the cross product and what's another thing that I'm gonna need Oh Matias made a full screen to the brilliant challenge awesome I will take a look at that soon thank you for that and then why am I doing this there was another URL that I wanted to pull up but I'm blanking on oh I know what it is silly me first of all that's quit processing so this is something oh I don't know why it's that I implemented quite a while ago that I just want to briefly show it's not the algorithm I'm gonna use today but I will come back to it where's this console.log why that's in there okay okay I think I am ready is this the same pattern each time no it's different I forgot how it'll random seed in their camera oh I definitely need to erase the whiteboard come back to me whiteboard camera there we go okay start here why I say the long Hank alright alright everyone oh no I want to be here this would be good to have some kind of like gift that's wrapped like a prop but whatever this is a good like holiday coding challenge it's gift wrapping algorithm all right hello and welcome to a coding challenge that's not gonna work what fine for me the date that this was published in 1973 because I was born in 1973 and maybe Jarvis published the giftwrapping 2d marching algorithm on my birthday and then that would be like some kind of cosmic alignment of how much you're gonna fail at doing this all right I gotta get started with this I really gotta get out of here by 200 so like this is good time for team kids all right especially cuz I really want to like animate it like this which is really actually the hard part but all right oh hello and welcome to a coding challenge today I'm going to tackle the giftwrapping challenge I'm going to make this ko and I'm going to wrap it up as a nice present so I'm going to hand it over to you and hopefully we'll make some something beautiful out of it or you'll learn something are all that kind of stuff that jazz alright so what is the giftwrapping algorithm so first of all the reason why I'm interested in this is this idea of doing an implementation of something called toulon a triangulation has been suggested and talked about for quite some time and I'm really interested in tackling this the truth of the matter is if I wanted to do a deal on a triangulation I would most likely just go and get to get a library that I that does it for me but there is some value in doing it yourself and I will get to that in a moment when I start looking at the gif traffic I'll come back to that now I I have looked at this before this is some code that I wrote a long time ago for an example and this is a demonstration of calculating a convex Hall whole this if I did it correctly is actually using a different algorithm from giftwrapping called the Graham scam not a scam it's not a scam the Graham scan and there are a variety of algorithms for computing a convex all there's the Chan algorithm and and more and they have various different efficiencies the giftwrapping algorithm is probably the least efficient but it's a good starter one so let me talk about what the what it convex hull is and this is not the right pen let me talk about what a convex hull is this is the right hand March 1st 1973 no it was published before I was born then misses the point it missed a point I don't know what that is let me talk about what a conflict let me talk about what a convex hull is first and then look at what the algorithm is and then we'll go and write the code for it so the idea is that we're starting with and this I should say is an algorithm part of the field of research called computational geometry and I would really like to do a variety of coding challenges around different computational geometry topics so if you have an idea for one write it in the comments so the idea of a [ __ ] of a convex hull is first we need just a random collection of points so if we have a twodimensional space and these algorithms typically generalize to higher dimensions but you know me I just like to be in two dimensions it's sort of my days where I used to be a mind I didn't used to be a mine I wish that was mine I don't know so let's say we have this random collection of points so the idea is that I want to connect these points in some way so we have this idea of convex and concave [ __ ] here's my random collection of points now first I need to make the distinction between convex and concave so here is a shape that is distinctly concave a pacman like creature so to speak there is a a vertex that is interior what is the definition there is an angle sorry that is greater I guess it would be an angle that's greater than 180 degrees that's the definition there is an angle but all of these angles of the shape there is one all of these angles that are made out of the vertices of the shape there is one that is greater than 180 degrees so a conchae a convex shape I let's get this confused but now that I know the term convex oh I won't forget it again if I wanted to turn this into a convex shape I would eliminate this point and connect these two points and now I have a convex shape and a convex hull is a polygon that you construct that is convex and contains all of the points so I can i ball this and I could go here then here then here then here now would I go in here no I'm gonna go down to here here here I'm gonna go here not gonna go here so this is essentially the gift I just sort of did my own performance in my with my brain of the giftwrapping algorithm I'm eyeballing it I don't you know I think I got it right but there's a proper way we can actually calculate it and the way that you do that lets get another random sampling of points is by first starting with and it's a point that we know is exterior what will be that that's on the convex hull the way to start with a point that we know that will be on the complex allof vertex of the convex hull is by picking either the leftmost or the rightmost or the topmost or the bottom most so a convention is just to pick the leftmost so I can see this is the leftmost point now what I want to do is check this point against every other point and whichever one is furthest to the left right whichever one is furthest to the left is the next point so I these are going to be in some random order I'm gonna check them in some order and I'm eventually gonna determine that okay which vector is most to the left it's this one so now I'm gonna go here and now I'm here and I want to do the same thing but now I want to pick which one is left of this this relative to this point and that's going to be this one over here right we can sort of see like if I draw a line out to all the points if I sort them all kind of along a radial path the one that's all the way to the left will be this one and then I just do that over and over and over again until eventually I get over here and I find that the one furthest to the left is the one that I started with and that's going to be my convex hull I think that's a good that's that's an explanation it works so yeah okay back over here coming back over to the computer on the Wikipedia page we can see a nice animation of this playing out and this by the way is one of the reasons why I like to write the code for these algorithms without a library so ultimately if what I'm working on a larger project and I need to compute a convex hull for some reason having a nice efficient maintained computational geometry of library is most certainly the way to go and maybe I'll try to find some examples of that there's plenty in JavaScript that I'll link to in this video's description but most of those libraries will just compute all the points all at once and hand them back to you and if you want to create some type of interactive explanation of the algorithm some kind of like or animation whether it's for artistic purposes or educational purposes you're gonna have to write the algorithm itself and it actually is harder to write the algorithm and animate it so I'm going to try to do that as part of this coding challenge rather than write the algorithm all at once that it just like calculates it and shows the end result I want to be able to see something like this animation playing out and that'll make this take quite a bit longer I'll be more to figure out but I think it'll be more satisfying in the end Simon I am looking I right now I'm looking at the YouTube chat there's a Lee Lee iOS video on the I should refer to that yeah giftwrapping algorithm the appropriate definition for this examples when you go around the shape you never turn left yes that's probably a better way of describing it what's this there's some World Cup game going on it's not what's happening some other stuff going on in the chat having to define the notion of turning left right for the purpose of oh okay all right all right all right was my explanation of good enough I think it was good enough all right oh okay actually I'm do the way I'm gonna do it as Oh N squared right because I'm going to be checking all the points always how is it only onh the inner loop checks every point in the set s and the outer loop repeats for each point on the hull oh right it's onh because you don't need to do every it's the outer loop is just until you get to the end okay great no the way I am gonna do it is onh okay great it's not om squared okay okay each time so yes yes okay great I also should mention that this 2d case is known as the Jarvis March invented by RA Jarvis and the time complexity is o NH n being the number of points and H being the number of points around the convex hull and the reason it's that is because for every point around the convex hull I have to check all the other points so that the number of points around the hall times all of the points it's a little bit better than ONS weird but not by much and again there are plenty of other more efficient algorithms for doing it this is just the one that I'm starting with okay alright let's actually write some code so I'm yeah let's start writing some code so I'm starting with a little bit of boilerplate which is just setting up an empty array putting ten random points in the array and I'm using the p5 vector object which I'll make heavy use of in this in this let me do that again alright let's write some code so I'm just starting with some boilerplate code I'm I've got an empty array I'm putting p5 vectors in it I'm using a p5 vector object to store a point and then I'm just drawing all the points on the canvas itself so the first step that I want to do is find you know you could say I could run this over I'm going to get a random collection of ten points and I mention I'll do this with a much higher number of points but let's start with just ten so the first thing I want to do is find the leftmost point and an easy way for me to do that would just be to sort the points so I can actually go here and I could say points dot sort and the JavaScript sort function takes a callback function it's not really which is a comparison function which compares two elements and so I'm gonna say a comma B I'm going to use the arrow syntax if you haven't you seen the arrow syntax before I'll refer you to my video on that I'll say a dot X minus B dot X so what this is doing is it's returning a positive number anytime a is to the right of B and a negative number anytime a is to the left of B and that should make it such that I can create a global variable I'll call it left for like the leftmost point left equals points index zero and now if I were to say you know stroke zeros 255 0 and say point P X P dot y I should see that the left point oh sorry left X and left out why I should see that the left point is green so there you can see that and every time I run it whichever point is most to the left is going to be green right now I need to find the next point on the convex and remember I want to animate so really if I were to just go to go back to the Wikipedia page and look at the pseudocode let me take this down so I see my nose does the Itchy thing as soon as I start getting nervous about what I'm doing if I were to go back to the Wikipedia page and just look at the pseudocode you're gonna see everything happens in just a set of nested loops I don't want any loops to happen because I want every time through draw I wanted the draw p5 draw loop I want to draw the next stage so what I need to find what I need is so I'm going to need another array which will be the points that I'm placing along the hull I want to say a left can be kind I think left can actually be thing I want the original that like the leftmost I'll call this leftmost and then we call this current hull current vertex like that's the current vertex that I'm on checking with and then I want to say let and then current point so vertex I'm going to use that term when it's of pacifically of vertex along the whole and point is the current point that I'm checking to see if it's the next vertex so maybe I also need next vertex so I think these are what I need and I'm so leftmost is just going to be this sorry is this and that's also the current vertex is going to start at they'll as the leftmost and then actually the current point is really an index so let me call that index and this is next vertex and index is going to start at 0 and this is leftmost and yes let me make the leftmost point also a little bit bigger oh I already mean we can make the leftmost point a little bigger okay and let's also do current vertex as blue so we don't see the green one anymore because the current vertex and I should make these brighter so let's just do that the current vertex is now being drawn over the leftmost vertex okay what's the next step I'm gonna need two indices all right so I'm gonna make a guess that the next vertex is just points index one okay I'm gonna make a guess when I'm starting that the next vertex is whatever happens to be the next point in the array it's probably it could be by coincidence but it's probably not going to be and I need a I'm confused here I'm really thinking about this you only have to check the point so you haven't reached so far yes I'm aware of that so I could just but I do need that first point still I do need to like sort of always include the leftmost point so I'm gonna keep that in there real let me I'll take it out yeah and then actually the one that I want to check is then at 200 so the leftmost point is zero the one that I'm guessing is going to be the next point is that one and then I got to start comparing everything at two so let's draw just for the sake of argument here I want to draw a line from current vertex to next vertex and let's say stroke 255 stroke weight 2 so we see look at that oh no because they're sorted so it's a lot I am seeking to get lucky a lot of the time because they're sorted but you could see in this case that's not it's really got to pick probably this one or that one so that's where it's starting now what I need to do is I also want to draw a line with the one that I'm checking so I'm gonna say checking is points index points index then I also want to draw a line to the one that I'm checking so we can see those are the two that I'm comparing so these are the two that I could pairing and let's make this stroke so this one's going to be like green and the one that I'm checking will just be white okay so this is what's happening right now I need to compare these two I need to figure out which one is to the left and by to the left I mean basically like counterclockwise rotation and guess what there's a really nice way that I can do that and the way that I can do that is with the crossproduct all right the cross product is a particular vector operation that you can apply on a 2d vector of two vectors that are in the same plane and it will return to you a vector pointing perpendicularly in the third dimension away and so what's interesting about this is I'm let me let me let me show you what I mean and I can never remember which is which but it doesn't really matter because we just need to know that it's one or the other if this is vector a and this is vector B the cross product of these two vectors will give me a vector pointing out this way this would be in a like a left handed system I guess cuz that's my left hand no no that's left handed would point the other way right handed I'm pointing out I think that's how you do it the point is it's pointing out but if I were to say this one is B so I'm doing a cross B and this one is a then I'm gonna get the cross product pointing in the other way so I just need to test is Z the Z value of a cross product B is it greater than 0 or less than 0 if by the way they were collinear or all along the same path you'll get 0 and we're just gonna assume for this case that I'm picking random points none of them are gonna be collinear probably sort of work out anyway but so if it B is to the left of a if Z is less than 0 it's to the right of a if Z is greater than 0 or the other way around but I'll just test it and its flipped anyway in a computer graphics system so it'll work itself out let's go try that so if I go back to the code what I need to do is I need to create those vectors so I'm gonna say a is p5 vector subtract and I want to subtract now what the current vertex no next vertex current vertex that's one of the vectors and then B is subtract checking the current vertex then the cross product which I will just call cross is a cross B I could implement this myself but thankfully it's oh I'm not in thank you everybody ah well I'm not doing a screen recording either I will have to do that again sorry everyone right hand rule I'm gonna get flamed in the comments for my miss so let's write write the code for that so what I need is I need those two vectors so a is a vector that points so I can use the subtraction function because I can point from the next vertex what is currently the next vertex to the current vertex that'll be vector a and then B will be pointing from the what I'm checking to the current vertex right and then then R the cross product is a dot cross B so I can implement the math for the cross product but it's actually just there in the p5 library for me and then I just want to say if cross is greater than zero then probably something like next vert so let me not do anything right now let's just see let's let's just console.log the cross product and say no loop so let's see we got o o cross dot Z the Z component we got a negative condom you're going barabbas all right so we got a negative number so the one that I'm checking is white the one that it currently thinks is green so is that right current one is green so if it's less than zero then that's to the left so if cross dot Z is less than zero then next vertex should actually be the one that I'm checking and then I just want to say index equals index plus one there we are now of course so you can see that as it goes through it's always gonna find the correct one is checking them all let's let's make a lot of points so it takes longer ooh that was weird why did that mess up it found it like instantly but it's checking them all I just yeah it's gonna find it pretty close because they're sorted but I think it's doing it correctly now something that I want to add that I think will just make this a little visually easier to follow is let me make a little variable called buffer and I'm gonna say pick a point between buffer whoops buffer sorry buffer and with minus buffer and the height also between buffer buffer and height minus buffer and let's make that buffer even bigger so now the points won't get picked super close to the edge so why is it getting is it not making it through everything oh it's making it through all hundred all right people are giving me some interesting comments all right okay now we need an exit condition so if index equals points ah shoot so now I definitely need an exit condition so I could say if index equals points length I've gotten to the end of the array and I could reset index back to what this is the question oh I should put it in the hall let me let go back to do that again so need to move like a little bit over am i standing in front of the code I don't think that I am but let me just give myself a little bit more so clearly I need an exit condition so I'm gonna say if index equals point length that means I've gotten to the end of the array let me at least say no loop here so I'm gonna like just stop it from animating once it gets to the end and let me just go back to like many fewer points just go back to 20 we'll do that pretty quickly and so what should happen is hull should get the next vertex did I put the current vertex into so hull should also get pulse should get the current vertex so now there are two points in the hull the current vertex should equal next vertex and then I need to reset index back to something so let's also now add something where I draw the hull so I'm gonna say begin shape stroke let's have the hull be blue begin shape I'm going to draw a let P of hull and I'm gonna draw all the hull points and shape and I'm not gonna say close but I am gonna give it a really light fill so I'm gonna say fill also have it be blue but with like a lot of alpha so am i seeing it I think as I said no loop let me put all the drop mail want this out for a second Oh because it's only two points and it's after okay okay okay all right so I'm not actually seeing the hole yet because only two points are in there and I'm drawing it before I'm drawing the green line and the white line so I could at least say like stroke wait for here and then I think I don't know why am I not seeing I think it's actually not even looping around I'm not gonna worry about that okay so I'm not actually seeing the hole yet because I'm drawing it before I draw these other lines and I've stopped the looping from looping but the real question is here is I need to then go and check for the next point so I need to figure out what to reset index 2 oh I also that's they didn't have that there oh why then I need to then I need to add vertex and I don't think I'm gonna see the hole yet because I've only drawn two points so far and I've stopped the loop from looping so let's let's see what happens what if I just reset index back to zero and turn off no loop okay it got stuck so I don't want to first of all it's two Eagles that should be equals Oh interesting so look at that it's doing something but there's a problem so resetting it's like it keeps checking but it keeps finding the same part of the convex hull over and over and over again so I can't reset index back equal to zero because ultimately I don't want to check these two points again I do actually want to leave this first one because that's gonna be my end condition but let's not worry about that right now let's actually do something where we remove the vertices from the points array when I put them in the convex hull just to see what happens but so hold on sup array JavaScript there are remove and now I can splice but can I just give it an object and it takes it out splice just uses index values or I could say I could just skip it if it if it's included or oh I know what I could do oh I know what I could do I could start at if I don't want to remove it I could start at the the object the the the vertex after the one that I just added I just want to actually ignore the last one I put in I don't need to ignore them all I just want ignore the last run I can't ignore them all but I want that first one to be included yeah make a check array yeah okay so we can see this is just finding the same vertex over and over again because exactly checking against itself and whatever cross product vector I guess that itself is probably give me zero back or something so it's always gonna work okay okay I know what I'm doing here I know index equals and it's not if index equals point length okay I don't want to check the same vertex yeah I mean I could just eliminate checking the current vertex why don't I just do that let's just try that that'll be simpler so you can see it's kind of picking the same part of the hole over and over again because it's allowed when I set index back to zero it itself is one of the points it's going to check so I think I could probably do something here that just say as long as checking is not equal to the current vertex and then I can put this all around this this should fix that oh no it's still stuck yeah I know I could ignore all them I don't want to because I want to oh but then I could just check if that didn't work why is that not working you Oh Oh next vertex Oh what next vertex needs to be something not what it currently is that's why next vertex needs to be set back to something else it could actually just be the leftmost I know for some reason I'm stuck I everyone's telling me to just take the point out of the list but I kind of don't want to because I want to keep the I want to keep all the points in the list because then I want to have I could make a step I don't know why I'm stuck on that I should just take the point out of the list all right and that because then I have to store its index and splice it all right I'll do that though maybe I should just admit that I have to do that all right so you can see that even though it's doing this over and over again it is stuck so even though you've seen that it's doing it over and over again it's stuck just picking the same vertex over and over again because that one is one of the ones I'm checking so what one way I could approach this is remove that one so the easiest way to do that would be with splice so I also would want to pick the I'm gonna say next in the next vertex I also should keep track of that next index we just set that equal to negative 1 as an initial value and then when I find it I want next index to be that index value and then I can say points dot splice next index and just take that one value out now I'm still stuck so the reason why I'm still stuck is because next vertex that it's comparing everything to is still that same one that it got before so what I should do is just reset next vertex to something else like I'll just put it back to be that leftmost one there we go so now you can see it's working now it's stuck when it gets to the end but guess what the reason why is as I know when I'm done right I am done if next if it actually picks next vertex as the same as the leftmost so when it finds that one then I can say console.log done no loop and then otherwise do all of this other stuff that I'm doing so let's see how this goes wah so let's make this more interesting by giving me 200 points and we can kind of take a look at this going now it takes a while to check all 200 so this should probably get sped up I'll allow speed this up for you where's my ukulele tuner is it in here somewhere I haven't learned any new songs I can tune it by ear it's definitely out of tune but I have a tuner somewhere I don't know where it is oh here it is uhoh I think I may need a new battery for my tuner so the reason why though I'm getting a question the last vector should connect oh I should add it so I would just use the clothes so the last vector is not connecting so what I should do is I should actually always push the next vertex in so that that first point is in there twice and then it will connect Oh wait what did I just do wait why did I just break it how did I just break it oh I didn't break it it just takes forever should I ruin that whole speeding up thing look at ik again for yeah I I got confused for a second so all right so Matt to that whole thing you can disregard so is being asked for me why is it not connecting there at the end well I could actually make it connect by changing the way that I'm drawing it to close so somebody's asking why is it not connecting there at the end and actually one of the reasons why it's not correct connecting is just the way that I'm drawing it if I add clothes here to end shape it will connect those last two you can see that they're now they're connected but it's also like closing it as it's going so maybe what I actually want to do is just change it to always put the next vertex in so that that is oh and but it's not then I say no loop it doesn't draw it again maybe I'll take out the no loop I'm just curious yeah removing the date I didn't actually remove the data right or did I splice them out I can't remember how I did it oh I did splice so I should really like put this into a separate array and then add them back in but whatever no I will mention that that's that's a very good point oops I don't know I'm like trying to make a this work for Matt to it to be edit for it to be edited well yeah you can see that the points are gone which is kind of a problem and so in a way it makes more sense for me to just leave them in there but skip checking them like like Simon was saying trying to think of what I want to say so one issue that's being pointed out to me from the chat which is really true is it's kind of a problem that I'm doing this splice because I've kind of corrupted the original dataset like I don't have that original set of all the points I have the convex all but I no longer have all the points so there's a couple ways I could approach that for example I could just like keep all those points that I'm splicing out in a separate ray and add them back in but what might be a better solution is adding is I'm actually already have this whole point this whole I already have the whole I already have the whole array so let's try this a slightly different way instead of splicing it out what I'm going to do oh that worked anyway why did that work no I don't actually need to splice it oh it's actually fine that's weird it's never gonna get stuck now I don't actually need to do this place does anybody understand why that worked because it in theory it's gonna check against itself if I don't take it out can I split it somewhere else just to make it more efficient I don't really care about efficiency let's take forever let's assume it's gonna get stuck at some point but I don't see it getting stuck the problem was next vertex okay yep okay great so Matt yeah there's a huge when you're looking at this later there's a huge amount of stuff that you can kind of ignore because I'm gonna just go from I'm gonna just explain that again so the chat actually is pointing out to me and rightfully so that this splicing out of the one that I saved is is problematic because I've corrupted the data itself I don't have that original array of points anymore and the context that I might be doing this vid that might actually be important so I could keep that intercept array I could add it back in but actually it turns out I've just discovered this through some debugging that I don't even need to delete it the problem was really the fact that next vertex was not reset back to the leftmost so it's actually going to work just fine every single time with split without splicing that out as long as I reset the next vertex back to like leftmost so that it sort of skips getting stuck so let's just make sure this lets watch this happen now with like 200 points and I will speed this up for you another battery okay we can see that it's done and it looks correct I'm pretty sure I did this correctly cuz it seems to be working of course this is less efficient because I'm checking extra points that I don't need to check because they're already part of the convex hull array so I can add something to check to skip those and but but this isn't even the most efficient algorithm the first place I just want to get this idea to work so um you can see that it doesn't actually connect at the end because I didn't I don't have clothes as one of the in n shape so I could add that in let me just put that in for you you'll see what this does differently speed this up again hmm something is wrong with this ukulele tuner because I just put a new battery in all right so you can see what it's doing now it is always closing the shape with whatever the latest vertex is but really while I have implemented this and gotten this working I have not picked nice colors have been really thoughtful about the stroke weight or how this takes a very long time to animate so it's nice and I'm kind of animating every single possibility but I think you could probably make something pretty interesting out of this by changing the way you draw it or thinking about how you might make this interactive or maybe the user can add points there's a lot of possibilities but this will be a nice building block a foundation to hopefully do more computational geometry coding challenges in particular eventually I want to build a triangulation around all these points and then figure out how to make Adaline triangulation which has to do with a way of having all the triangles the circle that fits any given triangle does it include any other points that's known as a circumcircle so I I think I will come back and do a coding challenge just to do the circle that fits any given triangle it's a pretty quick thing that I can show you but there's a lot more to come with this make your own version of this share with me go to the code and trade calm to the page with this coding challenge and there's a there's a instructions there of how to share your version of this maybe you could make this tie this to sound or something else that I can't even possibly imagine now I look forward to seeing what you make and oh also you might want to investigate one of the other algorithms in particular the Graham scan algorithm maybe I'll come back and actually just do that as a video also but if you if you make a version of that please submit that as well ok thanks for watching see you soon okay I think this is done there is a video to be made out of this I think it's almost more interesting with fewer points because of the way I'm animating everything all right so everybody please bake a version that doesn't check the points in the blue area yes so all the I ever I I appreciate what everyone's suggesting to me there are so many added efficiencies to this algorithm but I wanted to just literally do the basic giftwrapping one which I think I have done I will come back you can actually I'll publish the code for this one this is the Graham scan out and we can see how much a faster it is although I guess I'm probably not animating every piece of it maybe but so I I will come back and maybe do that or release this so I think I'm done for today let me check I'm just curious where is my brilliant challenge there was some things I just want to check which is the one I already did it which is larger I want to get mine up at the top people of course mine's not necessarily the best oh there it is alright I got helpful and interesting in a comment thank you the coder five five five zero Nilson yes all right okay where was who somebody somebody in the chat me was my TAS posted a link to a p5 sketch but don't know where that one alright I've really got to run this 215 oh my goodness this has been a very long livestream over three hours out of this will come a video part of a new series of making a processing library also this convex hull coding challenge will come out and then oh the final module three video ah thank you for asking this Arif so let me go back here let me find the bookmark bar the how do I get it to show so let me go here so I've been neglecting I know I I guess I'll release this on Monday then it's already there though I'm sorry that I kind of got sidetracked but this new playlist that I released called working with data and API is in JavaScript it's a full core that's kind of like a followup of my intro to coding it barely not with p5 it's with node and native JavaScript uses p5 in a couple videos there's a trailer for it here and then a whole set of videos they're all public this playlist I don't know why this playlist is also unlisted so you can actually find it I think if you just go into this video well and go to the description you could just go to the next lesson right here they're all available I just hadn't made them all welcome to another video I have one more thing just there sorry that that wasn't clear I find that if I really I don't know that this is actually true but my strategy with YouTube is even if I have like 10 videos ready to go I don't release them all at once because then their people's notifications just get the latest one it's confusing to find them so I kind of like act as if they're coming out one per day but often if it's ready or even if it's being prepared to be ready like I haven't put the English captions on yet or the thumbnails not done then it's just set to unlisted but you can usually find it in the playlist ok something similar to giftwrapping in 3d using claims and two points yeah probably alright I've really got to go thank you so much I this has been fun I hope that you enjoyed this livestream that it was good you got something out of it alright this is my gift to you you will now have a green screen of me solving a Rubik's Cube of course there's green on the rubix crew which is really gonna mess you up I'm hoping I can solve this before the music ends that's my goal one of these days I'll learn some actual speedcubing techniques this is basically a beginner's method I didn't make to do that Daisy so let's skip that one step I guess I make it slightly more advanced my son is turning 11 and I asked his grandparents to get him a new cube it's like a expensive fancy speed cube 3x3 so of course I'll just be using that seriously Oh getting so unlucky Oh what do I do with this configuration it's like I never figure out I just do it until i get the thing we liked I got it oh I messed it up I think I had it further solved and I thought I did there we go oh yes I beat the song so I don't know that was about three minutes if I was about three minutes okay missed easy saw with 32 I still the things that things that are not so great about mic technique is one I I can do it relative to a different side but it kind of messes with me so I'm I get messed up not us so I'm so I'm not really examining for like which is the best side to start with and I'm just yeah I also like some of the end stages I only know a couple of the algorithms like only know like the clockwise one to the clockwise one multiple times says I don't know the counter clockwise same thing to do it twice set of ones that doesn't make it very efficient all right so other things I know I have trouble leaving but I really do have to go I can maybe try and take one or two know that I'm I probably not gonna get to this day because I took so long doing this live stream but if you were I will be doing a Members Only recording session just a green screen recording session as I mentioned to record some interstitial explanations for the neuro evolution car challenge so stay tuned for that take a look at the community tab if you're a member or or if you're in in the slack channel as a patron you can check that as well thank you everybody so more I could could you could do more on sweep line algorithm okay that would be great so I will be back for in terms of schedule I hope I plan to do one live stream again next week I haven't set a date for that yet the best way to find out is either to subscribe as a member or patron I like post my thoughts on that as I go in the slack channel but you don't need to you can just subscribe to the channel and click the alarm bell and pretty sure it gives you a notification when I schedule it now you usually try to do that at least 24 hours in advance so one day next week I will be it might actually just be Friday the very last day of the week but hopefully I'll do it sooner I'll be doing one last livestream for the month of June and it's TBD what's gonna happen for July in August but I will be working on it's actually would be a good thing if I can't live stream for July and August and I'll tell you why this book really needs a new edition it needs a new edition to be ported over to JavaScript and it needs new material about neural networks and neural evolution and I think I could actually accomplish that in July in August if I'm not livestreaming and I could use that time that I would be to be just like working on the book because I've said this for like three years and I've basically got nowhere so I'm gonna work on this on Monday and this is what I will consider as a benefit to people who are members or patrons I will send you early drafts and four of the new book and hopefully the new book will come out until always be available for free it's just if you want the early versions getting those out over the summer all right I know but you could always just unsubscribe for me if I'm not producing enough content that's fine with me too okay thank you everyone and by the way so if it's unclear you can just the book is available for free if you just slide these to zero of course if you're able to support that's great or and it's also there's a HTML version of it but it's pretty out of date and I need to fix it up okay people are asking about what I do outside of YouTube live streaming so I will just mention this before I go I teach at a program why is the internet down did I lose the internet or is like the ITP website down No who knows I teach at a program there's two programs that issue ITP is the graduate master's program ima is the undergrad program there's a Tisch School of the Arts so correct I have definitely not a computer science professor I don't even know what I am but I do teach at a university a very big institution New York University and that's where I actually am right now and and this whole program is moving to a new building in Brooklyn and that's actually why I'm this face is going away in a new space is being set up where I can hopefully have some new equipment and stuff so stay tuned and I will see you in the future all right goodbye everybody I will play you out with this dot song after the Perlin noise silence good let's play that one first so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven this is like boys like girls and boys before to depart with curly noise I might pick numbers like this by purling noise that is totally noise so this is hurling noise that is Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that is hurtling know her Perlin noise that it's Hurley more this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley so this is Hurley noise that is her early early early early early early that is currently this is hurtling that is early early early early early it is but week early noise I might pick numbers like this this is like a noise I always forget this stock this stock it's fun never forget to this stop I'm gonna do this stuff this stock this dad this star this stop song never forget the Vista
