so do do good morning uh sound check um hopefully there will be much less technical fail than last week let me know how the volume of my voice is as compared to the music and i will be getting started in about two and a half minutes i'm also curious uh i'm reading the chat right now um if how is the echo of the audio i've i've had i have sound blankets foam but i'm not fully set up yet here so but you know just let me know the sound quality okay uh muting myself again getting started in about two minutes to three minutes do do all right the feedback came in my volume was a little bit low it's going into the red now on my dashboard so i think what i'm going to do actually is just turn the music down the music is getting lower and then i'm going to keep my voice down to here because when i start when i'm streaming i start to get quite animated oh now it's quite low okay here we go moving it up a little bit this should be good i think we're at a good place right now uh it is kind of going in the red when i get excited but you let me know okay everybody do do all aboard the train is coming into the station it is me i am streaming i see a green light over there i see a camera there i see a brand new bright light shining in my face over here it is friday morning the weekend is upon us it is a beautiful day here in the hudson valley of new york state where i am in a brand new well it's not so new this building that i'm in this garage was built in the 1940s but this studio that i'm setting up here is very very new and in fact uh well i've had so many so much technical difficulty um oh first of all can you hear that look at my mic i'm just wondering if you're hearing something i don't want to talk about what it is until i know that you're hearing it let me open up the chat here i have a new uh extra panel um that i can use to draw things um and et cetera et cetera all right the ipad is new and yes the ipad would be used for drawing aha so you think but i have something else that is new and set up not the final version of it no no not this sound effect so like not set up here i have you can hear multiple instances of my voice okay hold on i this is no i know this can happen but i don't think it's the issue that i think that it was um all right but okay wait uh drum roll please the drum roll sound have a bad feeling it's gonna completely disappear when i switch the camera view but i'm gonna press a button over here and i don't know if you can still hear the drum roll or still hear me but here i am over at my new uh oh that white board oh it's i put this together myself and i think it's it's a little wonky um i don't know that i'm gonna use it today um this is uh oh and i have a light here that i could have turned on point i have no lights over here i have another light that i purchased um and um i have this light stand here that has no light attached to it these are actually these wonderful i mean this is not a sponsor or anything but this is a uh this was recommended to me by folks at um standard uh youtuber agency group folks thing that i'm a part of uh runs nebula watch nebula um rx24 tdx roll flex led light i've got a stand and a thing so i got to get that set up over here i'm also planning to get a second camera what you're currently seeing now uh is i'm just making sure my audio is on because i cannot see the chat or anything from where i am what you're currently seeing now is um just my phone which actually is not the worst quality in the world and i'm just going to try drawing one of my typical diagrams of like oh i have a vehicle it has a velocity there's like a target so now we have a desired velocity so it's my intention as much as i do have an ipad with drawing apps and i may use that i just find that having a physical whiteboard just works better for me and has so many affordances in terms of gesture and that sort of thing i do have dreams though of getting one of those digital whiteboards like there's the google jamboard um which would allow me to have maybe the best of both worlds so we'll see to be determined um but i need another camera uh i need to set up the light i've got a new streaming computer arriving it's uh hopefully it is arriving where is my button here so right now there is a small nice little windows pc to my left it is broadcasting um over the internet to you what am i even talking about but it doesn't have a capture card it doesn't have a very good graphics card i have purchased a brand new streaming computer it's got a capture card it's got a uh nvidia 8 3080 something magic graphics card thing it's gonna be awesome and supposedly it's coming on october 5th so i got to get that set up it's going to allow me to hopefully do a have better quality streaming more uh you know more inputs i don't have currently have like there's no way for me to have a second camera because i don't have another like i have these like usb capture boxes things so i'm gonna have so much more by the way this is like an awesome segue to coding train today and all this stuff is very expensive is uh sponsored by brilliant oh thank you brilliant i'm working on this new studio no thank you to you and also to the viewers who then go and choose to sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain the banner right up there um if you like learning and watching video channels like the coding train to learn about code and math and science and physics as part of science and all of that stuff you will also love brilliant a website an app so many um interactive lessons and exercises and daily challenges there's a course on learning python there's a course on learning neural networks these are the ones that i generally plug because they're excellent i was just looking at the neural networks course for my class that i'm teaching on machine learning so it really helps me thank you again brilliant uh it is brilliant and um all sorts of wonderful stuff so i'll come back when i what i think the last time and halfway through this stream i like to look at a challenge or a lesson from brilliant and kind of pull the audience and work through this i'll come back and do that later but right now i would encourage you you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain if you want to unlock everything that brilliant has to offer you will get the first 200 people to use that link will get 20 off of the premium subscription okay now back to our regularly scheduled programming welcome my name is dan i tend to i i have this thing it's a youtube channel it is called a coding train and i like to program on it and make do lessons about coding and interact with the viewers and have fun and mess up and show you that programming is can be creative enjoyable difficult frustrating uh all of the above emotions the whole range what are the like twelves the the nine stages of programming i don't know some well we'll work that out later if this is your first time watching thank you uh hello how are you is everything okay even if it's not hi i'm here for you in this small internet way the best that i can be um things are a little bit rough right now rough around the edges new setup new commute to my day job teaching at nyu less time for the coding train oh i hear it in the comments so much i missed the coding challenges where are the coding challenges how many don't do coding challenges i hear you i'm going to find my way back to them somehow uh things will change um in the new year 2022 next year um i currently am teaching three classes which is a tremendous amount of time and work gloria my dog is uh enjoying being here upstate in the hudson valley she is sitting in the sun over there in the grass that you can't see need to get a dog cam going um but i will um i have a sabbatical semester this spring and one of the reasons why i'm up here and setting this up so hopefully there'll be a lot more stuff to come in 2022 so bear with me thank you to all those of you who are supporting through the coding train membership program where you get some stickers and various things uh but i know uh things are a little wonky a little bit light i i tried in the past somehow i made this all work well in the past i don't know where where my past self went my my rhythm of the week was always one day recording tutorials one day live streaming and i can't seem to fit both of those in right now so here i am i'm definitely live streaming today i'm going to try to live stream it's either going to be on mondays or fridays i think fridays is kind of a better day for you the viewer monday might turn out to be a better day for me this the streamer so we'll see stay tuned but hopefully i'm going to be at least uh every week missing you know you know thanksgiving the hallet holiday week i'll probably miss and here and there um some other things here and there so i've got some other family commitments and stuff so um the video recorded video tutorials are a little bit going to be slow there's some new ones coming out on path following vehicles path following chapter six of the nature of code one of them is like completely ready to go i just have to press some buttons get it out there uh the dot product how to find the angle between two vectors what is scalar projection and you might be saying i've already watched your video on that yes i made video on that probably eight years ago so this is an update updated version with you know little animations and better quality uh production values and that sort of thing looking at the chat barrick is saying i asked a question a few moments ago but still no answer so i have the chat both right over here i have the chat over here on different monitors i'm also looking at the uh the discord live chat for members um but it's very hard for me to do you know there's nobody else here but me i mean i've got gloria gloria do you hear that sound okay happen again while i'm not talking i hear it and i stop talking and it won't happen again i really want to know if you hear it anyway gloria's not much help when it comes to producing this show she's a wonderful she's my uh my love my emotional support dog i mean she's not officially that but it truly works in that way um and uh yeah but it's just me so i can't really like uh i can't really follow all the chats and everything going on i'm going to get better at it i've been doing this for years so i don't know what's what's taking me so long but i think as i get used to this new studio and get a little bit better into the rhythm of things i'll figure out stuff so my most live streams will include the goal of my live live streams is to engage with the community so to look at your contributions to the website um i like to go through like a recent video and read through some comments and reflect on those i'm not going to be doing as much of that today i mean and then you might be saying like oh great i mean you're actually going to do some coding instead of just like wasting a lot of time not so sure about that um but uh what i will be doing is today is the actually don't don't read this tweet literally anymore because this tweet was from several days ago today is the last day to submit a page to the processing community catalog oh no no oh oh the camera's not plugged in to power oh i knew i forgot something sorry everybody okay don't worry uh where is that plug oh my god are you kidding me you're kidding me okay ah i must have like taken it to plug something else in please bear with me oh we were we were so close i have so many cables aha here's one this is the cable i need i can't show it to you and i think i can actually just oh is it going to reach so don't worry this is not this is just because the camera it was uh running off its battery and now i am going to plug it in so i don't look plug come on go in there uh let's see a little light come on are you charging you're charging uh let's see if i can turn you off and back on again i'm gonna count ten nine eight seven come on build your charge up six five four three two one you all hear that sound okay camera's back oh or oh yeah that's back okay uh let's see make sure it's back okay it's back what where was i where was i you say i uh remember i was reading this um share a photo of work a snippet of code a screenshot of a webpage you made or anything else we want to include you in this publication so um processing foundation is an organization near and dear to my heart um processing foundation uh maintains uh a lot of the uh pretty much all of the coding platforms that i use on this channel uh processing p5 it was the 20th anniversary of processing uh the software itself and this is the community catalog so i'm going to click here on more information here and so the idea is to make a community catalog to celebrate all we've done together with processing for the last 20 years i would like to say that i'm not a procrastinator but with certain things i absolutely am submissions are due by 11 59 pacific time oh pacific time oh wow i got till i'm on eastern time i got a whole extra three hours uh on friday october 1st 2021 so these are the specifications i can submit a tiff or a pdf tiffs should be this resolution grayscale i can use this google form i can email it i can put more information i can use a language that's not english i can contribute more than one page if one is for a group project or organization hey coding train is kind of an organization it could be multiple pages i kind of would like to just do one page uh this is only about processing what about p5.js it's a celebration of everything related to the processing foundation including processing p5 and all the other initiatives with python ruby as well as related advocacy work so um oh and i see computational mama is in the chat processing fellow and a fellow streamer and educator everyone should check out big shout out to computational mama everyone should check out oh no no no no no the camera i think it just needs to build up a little bit more of a charge oh my gosh why did i not have it plugged in all morning uh all right here i'm turning this camera on this is gonna be interesting uh i'll just come talk to you for a little bit so here's so i'm over here so the problem is now i can't see the chat i want to make a brainstorming list well i'm going to talk through some of my ideas uh okay you see how this like shakes as i erase it i think maybe i didn't put it together like well this is kind of a cheapy white board okay here's the here's something you'd do to help me i would in bed i would you know i've invested a significant amount into the streaming computer i'm going to get i could repurpose this whiteboard just to be like an extra like whiteboard for my own notes it does have the a nice added benefit of being able to flip over but it's not i might need i mean i got to figure out how to light it and get a different camera and i've already lost my marker oh here it is um so hold on i'm just going to turn this other camera off and let it kind of build up a charge i guess i mean it is plugged in right yep the light's on okay so i'm coming back over here so um i want to figure out what is it that i would like to contribute i mean am i making a personal contribution me daniel shiffman my 20 years with processing which has had not 20 years you know i started working with processing in 2003. so i'm close i'm pretty darn close i'm back there with the old timers but not the full 20 years um um so but i think i would like to make a page that's really just from the coding train um and i would like it to be representative of the community you the folks that are watching i'm checking to make sure my audio is going so some ideas that i have is our thumbnail see it shakes while i draw that's going to drive me completely bonkers i have no idea how the picture quality is and all of that there's no lighting this is just my phone and a whiteboard uh at some point i will properly light this area with a nicer camera i mean the quality is actually quite good um but i would love any suggestions for like a really nice solid high quality maybe matte finish is there such thing as a matte finish white board that doesn't reflect so much i guess i could get one of those glass things and then reverse the camera i don't know you tell me thumbnail collage so i could do this i could try working on today like some type of script that just like sucks all of the thumbnails from maybe all the coding challenges or all the p5 tutorials something like that make a collage of those that's a possibility um another would be just a collage of sketches i mean i would so it could be just all my whole set of example sketch sketches make a collage of them um i would love to add the coding train characters somehow boy uh jason you're not watching this right now but jason eggman who does i mean first of all he's on the west coast it's probably too early but um somebody pinged jason with the discord tell him oh i forgot to mention this to him it's due today but um i mean i can figure this out myself but um it might be nice to include like some of the coding trained characters on this page so i could talk to jason about getting a little design help so let me make a note of that uh coding train characters oh god this this is not gonna do this shaking white board's not gonna do i have i i only have tissues so that's not really a great solution for erasing okay collage of sketches now these could be community contributions also you know uh you know i'm a little bit last minute here so if i had been more thoughtful and prepared i would have said like hey a month ago putting out a call recording trades the community contributions to go on the coding trade page but yeah but maybe we can work that out today i can't see the chat so you have all these ideas now you're telling me i'm sorry i can't see them i'm gonna come look i do see that there's like either a super chat you could see a big blue bar over there on my monitor um so i need so that's another mental note i guess i'm going to maybe i need a secondary screen to be able to monitor the chat while i'm i could actually have a table right here put another screen there so while i'm at the whiteboard because i'm quite far away from the monitor that i look at while i'm at the computer um and then uh your idea is here so i'm gonna go look now into the chat and uh hopefully the cameras had a chance to like get a little bit of a charge going so i could turn it back on um and then maybe we'll do a poll and see if folks have thoughts or ideas about what and i'm not intending necessary to finish the community the the point of today is a couple things one i want to encourage you to submit your own contribution so i'm just doing some outreach here hey you should make one you got today you you love processing you've worked with processing and all of the related tools make something contribute yourself to the community catalog that's number one number two i would like to contribute something i have not gotten it together to do so what can i get started with during this live stream i gotta wrap up around 12 12 30 my time um so and then what could i reasonably finish off later today to the extent that i have a little bit of time i've got a lot going on i got to pick up my kids from school gotta cook them dinner there's a lot of stuff happening today i'm uh solo parenting uh for this weekend my wife is uh traveling so uh things are there's a lot going on oh i have meetings work meetings and there's zoom nyu that i think i'm going to participate in i probably have a long todo list you don't need to worry about this i'm going to be fine i i've got this beautiful garage it's actually got um i really want to show you more about the garage but i can't right now it's actually a heated garage the heater is not on the boiler comes on every once in a while because it's like one of those um just in time it's like an old boiler at this i'm like learning about all this stuff you know this is not this is not important let me i'm i'm stalling because i want the camera to develop a charge i'm going back to the main camera uh hopefully um this is all still working i'm gonna i'm gonna turn this camera back on and hopefully i really don't think this is the overheating issue it is very cool in here right now i think it's just that it was not plugged in so i'm looking to see it is on yeah it it does say it's plugged since the battery is dead but it is plugged in oh there's no light wait a second it does say that it's plugged in though well no i'm unplugging it gets unplugged plugging it in okay it says it's plugged in usually there's a light on when the battery's charging but you know let's just see how it goes um i can always stream with you know just my voice um all right here we come back to here here i am uh let me take a look at the chat so i don't know i'm going to kind of scroll through the chat thank you oliver for your kind um message i'm going to scroll through the chat here and see um camera went out do we have to make code from processing or can we do it in p5 says nurage um you know any processing rp5 um text is readable glass in reverse is very cool those glass things are oh everyone's telling me i actually got one of those glass things light it from the side might work or even above yes um collage of all your video thumbnails okay great make a text writing processing or coding train with your thumbnails i'm trying to understand what that means instead of collage ah oh like what if we did i i think dusk had this idea in the discord which was like a um photo mosaic so kind of oh i could make like the p5 i could i could make a page that says p5 and kind of out of all of the coding train thumbnails oh this is interesting let's see if i can get that to work letting a whiteboard and avoiding glare is tricky says will yes ascii art with random numbers that's a good idea also um image to submit i'm working on one project stuck with a problem so cornell is asking about csv files they can't can't really go right now i think it's not the best time for me to answer coding questions i'm trying to think though join the discord that's my plug oh and i have another thing that i need to talk about oh i won't be able to log into the discord oh blah um you know what i think maybe i don't need all right i got a lot of stuff going on in my head as you can see um uh your orioles are killing my playoff hopes for the red sox look look no one is allowed to complain that the orioles are messing up some other team what is the memorial's record what do they want like 20 one out of five games seems like the worst team in baseball but i'm gonna wear this hat and when the orioles win the world series sometime hopefully in my lifetime you'll all remember that i was wearing this hat all along ever since i was a young a young lad what is the task here dan all right so let's just start um le i'm going to put up a quick poll i've got a couple ideas here where can i do this um am i no i'm i'm who am i here hi that's me i'm logged in as myself but not as coding train uh um all right so can i do this over here how do i start a poll yes sorry i this is awkward i need a better way to uh set up polls through and of course i know i know i have the whole live poll node app that so many people put so much time in but now you just put a poll right in the chat it's a bit easier okay so i'm gonna uh create a poll uh i i think the collage is kind of the idea so collage of all right like so let's just start this way um uh coding train processing catalog page so what are my what are we voting on one possibility is uh the collage of thumbnails i i think this poll is kind of pointless because i think it's kind of coming into my head what makes sense to do another one was cl so this is not so great because i'm gonna i'm almost gonna consider these hold on okay let's let's all right we're gonna do this collage of images so i'm gonna just make one of the option collage of images i'll worry about whether it's thumbnails or sketches later uh uh photo and uh i think this is a good idea i don't know why i'm making the poll so i'm gonna make that whole collage of images or something else i like the random number idea uh and um let's see is this poll going did it come i don't know if this is working does it show up on my side can i vote on it can i vote i made a poll did it did it show up does anybody see it no let me it's i think i think we all know what we need to do right now uh bear with me kind of wandering around back here do you hear that listen do you hear that let's go back and listen myself later oh wait there's so many cables okay i'm looking at the pole now i see collage of images is winning at the moment weird on the ipad app for youtube the poll doesn't seem to show up but um yeah you can hear it right so uh the word processing or its logo made up of your thumbnails yeah that's what i would like to do oh no the poll is here okay great i am okay don't worry everybody this is going to make us all feel better no but wait i had a whole system for this so oh no where were we so unfortunately i can't get into the discord right now because would you really like to know why oh i'm so glad you asked the reason why i can't get into the discord on this laptop is because it got logged out and the only way for me to log back in is to get my twofactor authorization code which is currently only available through my phone which is plugged in over there and uh in order to get this shot so i guess i could kind of get into it somehow and then run over there and get the code and come back but that seems like a lot of effort can somebody tell me where i was when i was last reading the random numbers this is my random number book it helps calm me down helps bring me some peace it is my personal dark hold is that a thing you could say i don't know oh uh no it's you're seeing me uh we're gonna go with the collage of images so i love this idea we'll make a collage of coding terrain let's start with the idea of thumbnails because i can just get those like those already exist um we'll i will see if i can make a photo mosaic uh of them um to show like the p5 or processing logo i think the p5 just i'm just going to do the text p5 so so let's go open up processing four you join this music uh so i am yeah simon's like how are you i'm i'm logged into the discord over i'm seeing so i i am logged in the discord on the pc but it's sort of set up my console is set up with like a view of just one channel with the font really big so i can see the messages and i would have to go over there and switch to another channel and scroll around and it's just very inconvenient to do that music is very unnecessary okay so let's get started don't you love the new processing 4 design i really love it and i know i've made a photo mosaic before i think i made a photo mosaic of obama that's one of the coding challenges let's go look at that maybe we should just start with that code that'll get us started a little faster uh photo mosaic so let's go to this and let's download this code so i'm going to start from here and see where this gets us um and uh let's i'm just gonna put this on the desktop and i'm gonna call this um coding train processing p5 mosaic okay this is the name of our project by the way i don't i wonder if this i can't remember if this changed in processing four but um uh at least in older versions of processing and maybe still the name of the pde file the sketch has to match um so let's open this up the data here is um this is the image to make the photo so i'm going to change this to like p5 so let's um open up photoshop it should make this all right let's do this in p5 okay so we know the aspect and by the way i do need to take a break at around 11 30 and make sure i tell you about the sponsor brilliant don't let me forget um so the information about the specs is where uh 2250 by 3 000. so i'm going to just do 225 by 300 to start um so just to get like a basic version going i i'm like arbitrarily using p5 and processing just to like have fun and use both of them for no good reason okay just in case you're like why are you doing this uh so let's make the background 255 fill 0 text p5 we'll put it in the middle okay let me just talk about what this is that's gunfire that you hear i am in the hudson valley uh my new home is here um and i believe that i live somewhat close to a skeet shooting range i mean it's pretty far away if you look on the map but you can definitely hear the gunshots it could also just be somebody who is doing some target practice in their backyard somewhere around here but it's a little disconcerting to me i am not a gun person uh i uh uh i i i now is not the time for me to get into a long uh a rant about gun control and gun culture here in this country that i live but it's uh i can't not acknowledge that sound that's going on in the background uh the ipad angle is going to hurt your wrist if you use it for too long yes right now it's actually just a uh an extra screen for me to look at i'm following the chat there francello says no more cabana oh i i just want to talk to you about all the things i got to make this community contribution though the cabana is not gone for good um i'm taking some time to live here and set up this new studio and we'll probably return to brooklyn and the the cabana is still a place that i have access to it's complicated uh not ever not all the time maybe not for a year but then i might come back to it i'm happy to like explain all the details it's just a long story and i don't have time to go into that right now uh maybe i'll do it uh what's the thing is clubhouse clubhouse is no longer a thing right i need to do like a discord stage and i could tell you my life story i'm sure you will all be fascinated uh to hear that but i got to get back to this uh but um making videos in the style of coding in the cabana whether it's in the physical cabana that's located in brooklyn or some new outdoor setup here where i have a lot of space i would love to do that uh in the new in next year right now teaching three classes trying to just live stream once a week and get some new tutorials out that's about all i can handle okay um what am i doing here unexpected end of input i need a a curly bracket oh that's beautiful okay there everybody i present to you now my brilliant sophisticated coding contribution to the processing community catalog i call it t5 all right we're going to work on this a little bit more let's try making the text size uh 64. i'm going to turn on auto refresh i'm going gonna run it that's looking better can i get up to 128 oh it's looking really good uh text font um what's a font that i could oh oh there's a new font there's a new font that is the new for the new coding train website i think i can end this poll or at least like get it out of my way there we go um so andre said you can sell it as an nft oh god speaking of things i don't have time to go off on a tangent about um text font so what is that font called maru i think i don't i mean i shouldn't be giving this away it's a new font that i love gt maru but i haven't purchased it yet um it's a really fun font that could be fun to put p5 in it but anybody know what the font i mean object could just load should probably just load the p5 logo itself but let's just try i like a good fixed width font just as much as the next youtube streamer it's really loud and uh we can work worry about the seed image more later how can i make it can i make it bold how do you do that is that going to work no definitely not i i'm spending way too much time on this like little thing let's i think the default was good oh no okay hold on should it be a lowercase p uh what what happened there okay i like the uppercase p all right this is good enough save uh p5.png okay stop no block stop i don't want to block it actually oh allow allow okay so now that that was a tremendous amount of time how long did i spend doing that like 10 minutes just to get a seed image so let me take that let me put it into here um i you know um i don't think uh okay and let me open up sorry let me open up the the sketch that i'm basing it from oh hello how come that didn't open all right interesting i don't know how to use processing desktop ah here we go all right so let's call this uh p uh p5 image we're going to call it p5 image p5.png is that what i called it yeah and uh let's go with the dimensions uh that 225 by 300 225 by 300 and let's multiply it by four and i think by the way in in uh thank you taser cake um roboto i like that font um wait i i don't i don't remember how this sketch works at all let's just actually have it be 225 by 300 let's see what happens and this is gonna load okay okay so p5 image i did guess i did something for resizing the image which array out of bounds exceptions see this is the problem with starting with some code that i made a long time ago i have no idea how it works did i comment it am i able to figure this out oh my goodness i have to sneeze okay i'm back from my sneezing um yeah so uh zaram is asking what what what what why is this called obama what's going on with obama a long time ago i made uh i showed an uh a sketch about how to make a photo mosaic and the sample image that i used was an image of former president obama um but right now index one out of bounds for length one the question is where did that error happen here files i plus one to string am i not oh starting at plus one to ignore this is look at this comment this oh brilliant coding i must have this is uh the lapel mic is noisy against the hoodie thank you for letting me know uh if it is acceptable right now um and not like impeding your ability to follow what i'm doing i'm gonna have to leave it but i i take that note and thank you let me see what i can do to improve that i actually want to buy a new lapel mic because if i'm going to use it i might as well have a really high quality one this is just one that i happen to have um all right so let's look here let's bright images all images all images p image 100. file name files oh no files data.photos so weird why oh using a smaller amount just for testing okay so let's look at um let's do print i think print array in processing will print out the array so let's just see what's here i mean obviously i want to get my thumbnails i just i want the console to move up there we go let's try running this aha oh i remember now look there's a readme file in there oh how convenient boy whoever documented these projects really did was very thoughtful this directory should be filled with images you'll then need to remove this file or at least add something to check that each balance directory is in a draw okay let's get some thumbnails now um can something like i could obviously well certainly if i had a lot of time and was doing um this more thoughtfully i might like to do a lesson on how to use the youtube api i already have some examples and i'm kind of tinkered with that during live streams um yeah and lee is pointing out a really good point which is the photo mosaic challenge was based on the brightness of each image to match an area of the obama photo and your p5 image only has black and white so uh but let me just get going with the way that i'm doing it and maybe we'll make the actual p5 image more interesting or think of a different way of doing it but one step at a time so how do i get my thumbnails i'm hoping there's a tool that i like to use called youtube dl and i wonder if this will allow me to just like get thumbnails of all embedding okay so um let's look thumbnails let's just look them does anybody know ah right thumbnail right all thumbnail image formats to disk so can i do skip down so i could do skip download and write thumbnail presumably okay so the question is do i have youtube dl currently installed on this computer uh sure why not okay so awesome i've already installed youtube dl so if you're following along and want to make your own thing and by the way whatever i do here today i'm looking for all of you to help with this so but at a minimum i'm going to upload everything that i do here to a github repo and i will gladly take contributions all day long to improve the visual design etc of what i'm making so please i would love your contributions here okay um so i let's just first do something like uh let's just go get an individual i'm gonna get like the snake video uh for example which is the most watched video on the coding train uh and i'm gonna say youtube dl i think i can give it the link to that video then i to say get thumbnail simulate quiet but print i want to write thumbnail oh no that's like a ver okay skip download oh it's like simulate that's interesting i um so see that's really useful like one of the things i try to do with youtube download is figure out is this really gonna work to download my entire channel like i've done that like download everything from the channel but um like how do i know if it's gonna work because i got to sit there and wait for it to download everything but you can i guess you can run the simulate thing and it'll just like step through everything without downloading super useful so skip download right thumbnail where was that embed thumbnail thumbnail right thumb write all thumbnails simulate list thumbnails let's do this first because i i might this might give me a clue of what i want to get so this is giving me all these thumbnails with different so i think probably i mean for a photo mosaic that's going to go on a big high resolution page this size is probably big enough doesn't look like there's anything larger so certainly i want the and what if i just do a right thumbnail which one is it going to give me uh what size did it give me by default oops oh okay first of all i should be a little bit more careful i'm just doing all of this right now at user slash codingtrain so let's go to this project what i call it p5 mosaic uh we can do it from within here yeah this is good let's go to here let's run this previous command again now we should have an image okay whoops what what is going on with me here oh here we go let's see an image it is 336 by 188 so that's very low resolution but i think we'll do fine the one thing i don't love about this is it's very vain like i'm i mean i guess it's my own fault you know i should i i don't know why i'm like all of a sudden like oh i'm making my community contribution page i don't want my face in it like my face is everywhere otherwise um so uh yeah i guess i will go with it for now but um so that looks good so now um i believe what i can do i'm just going to start with the coding challenges um that'll be a good start if i go to like the coding train channel i think this is the coding challenge playlist so if i go here i think i should be able to say um the same thing but i put the playlist uh in i guess i could have done the simulate thing but let's so it should be downing downloading 222 thumbnails right now um looking at the chat um all right let's see how this is going this is fun so um you know for those of you who might be wondering like how can you do this yourself um so this is the youtube um youtube dl project and i would assume here under installation this is these are some instructions for how to download it so what's what will be confusing for you if you're kind of new to all of this maybe you've just you're just learning p5.js right now is all of this it needs to be done through sort of console terminal access shell access to your computer so if you're a unix user you probably know all about that mac os i'm using something called item that's what this is but the the built into your computer is something called terminal so in theory you could open up terminal and follow these instructions ah the camera there's really no reason for it to like not hold a charge it's plugged in um i'm going to just live with this for a little bit right now and switch to this view so i'm just you're getting my voice and my screencast here so um and windows it looks like you can download an exe so if you are on um if you are on windows um try that and maybe in the chat people could talk about um other ways to um to do that it's interesting now that like the camera's not on me i feel so free i'm like reading the chat looking down i'm like walking over here to find my water having a little drink of water now which you can probably hear i could walk outside and shoot some hoops i have a little basketball hoop about 20 feet from me [Laughter] i've got a wireless mic i can do anything i'm not on camera anymore um okay so let's see how that's going okay we're still so we're still doing this interestingly enough i believe that i could first of all we should we could improve this right there's got to be a way well if it works it works i just i don't love this um this is as the method to um ignore ds.store but uh let's go and uh we're in this directory we've got let's just check what's coming in to see so first of all these are all very very similar in design they will change oh why are some of them like all of a sudden super high res that's so interesting like what so arbitrary all right so by the way here's the uh here's the obama photo mosaic coding challenge but i used to make so many of these and what's happened to me ah oh oh memories like the corner of my mind uh now the lawnmower from the neighbor is going i don't know if you can hear that um all right or how are we doing there still downloading oh we're so close to being done let's give it a let's wait a little bit um no oh yeah sorry the chat people are saying there's a helicopter no no that's a lawn mower not a helicopter all right um i'm getting so close now yeah oh yeah yeah that's a lawn mower all right what time is it 11 25 okay some images are saved as web pm and others as jpeg that is useful for me to note again i don't need to have the perfect finished version oh yeah oh no webp is going to cause me a problem probably gonna need to do this again like i don't know if processing is gonna be able to open a webp image but let's see what happens let's at least let this finish okay finished did i turn hold on i just want to make the key i'm going to make sure the camera is actually charging yeah it is so at some point i don't know what's a good amount of time for me to wait but somebody remind me at some point to go turn the camera back on i could also use just like my webcam here this is going to be fun new movie recording this is like hi everybody put that over here and move this back over here we go i'm back on screen everybody did you miss me here i am up there no i'm here i'm here my green screen behind me okay um so this will this will get us a little bit further now let's see what happens could not find a method to load web p so how do i get the format so now i need to go back to um here thumbnail right thumb list thumbnails shoot does anybody know how to look at this sketches over here does anybody know how to tell it to make sure to get the thumbnail as a jpeg i guess i could write a script now to convert all of them i could do that in node uh processing can't load webp so many of them came in as web p i'm now i'm i'm stuck you're lost hold on let's other thing i can do here there's a temporary solution while i think about this or get a suggestion um let's go over here and go to a list i want list view and let's sort it by kind and let's just get rid of all the webp images so that's a webp image i'm just going to delete all the webp images ultimately i just want to start with something and is this 100 images did i get 100 uh so tell me how many images are in this folder 67 items oh i was so close i was so close 67 so i think it should be okay if now uh i just do 67 or like oh yeah whatever the length of it is uh because this was just to use a smaller amount for testing okay let's see what we get now and sorry this uh this sketch can go away don't save let's see what we get okay could not find a method to load ds store but what of my my full proof solution there's no way that anything could ever go wrong if i have this brilliant i plus one line of code so that i ignore ds store let's print line files all right we're going to have to improve this error checking oh look there's a bunch of bad data may not contain an image oh come on so cruel to me that things have to go wrong so is ds store coming at the end all right let's let's fix some things here boy this is a very uh exciting live stream let's just see make sure all of these are valid images there's only 67 of them how could there be bad data they're all working fine for me ah no i mean what should be wrong with this one it's a jpeg and it's the last one giant face convert thumbnails format uh says oscar bartos i think it is on youtube not youtube dl sponsor break reminder yeah no i want to get a little bit let me at least get i want to get something to run without an error and then so uh i am going to change all images to what am i filling i'm filling why did i do this oh cause i want to like change the size of all of them no matter what they are image okay all images i would like to make all images an arraylist that way i can i can vet any given image and then um sorry that i'm like talking to that camera which is not at all active i can vet any given image and then add it to the arraylist and like i don't have to know the exact amount of images i'm going to have so this is why i should would like to be in javascript right now but arraylist sorry goes like this arraylist of p image objects is a new arraylist of p image objects is that how i do it i think that's how i use an arraylist in processing all images so i don't need this anymore and then um brightness so this i'll do later this i'll do later well no this is always going to be 256 images uh print line files yeah i still want to do that so now i want to go through all of the files file name equals files index i to string now i need to say if file name i mean i could i kind of want to use a regular expression but i'm just going to say index of i think index of dot jpeg so for all jpegs is greater than negative one then i can do all this stuff and i'm going to say otherwise print line not a valid image so uh so i think this should be good this should be a nice little check to make sure it is a jpeg let's print line the file name and forget about this so i'm going to go through every file one at a time why not filter the files list yeah oh abominal monkey in the chat is giving the suggestion of exactly what i'm doing old reddit post suggests using ffmpeg to convert the webp images that's a good idea okay let's try this and see if oops i must be missing i must have messed something up oh no no no no no wait what what what is this find the closest image for east brightness value all images i'm so confused oh so oh i should i should be really making an object here so i should make my uh all right welcome to welcome to refactoring old code with me your host dan shiffman meanwhile three hours later no project has been made uh all right so i if you if you will bear with me although the brightness thing we're even thinking we maybe we don't even want but i i can't help it and i know i need to take a break but so i'm going to say image tile i'm going to make a class called an image tile which has a p image in it and then a brightness value that's a function in processing but i don't think that matters wait what's wrong with this oh because i'm missing some something else um and then i need to write the constructor uh image is in it so i'm going to make it you know let's i i think maybe we don't set the brightness till later so just set it equal to zero to start and so now i don't need this separate array don't need this separate array okay wait i'm frozen let's see if the camera works again because i don't know why that camera froze um um let's see here uh camera oops nope uh let's see if i can get the camera back how we doing camera did you get to charge up at all i wonder if like the battery's not even in there or something okay you're on uh yeah oh there's a charge the battery has a charge in it and it's plugged in this is a good sign okay we're back people i'm very small i don't know i've kind of picked an arbitrary size for myself okay so the idea now is my arraylist is of image tile objects and then i am going to load an image oh this isn't going to work what is going on i'm going to load the image oh i know what i'm going to do this should go in the constructor oh fancy so now this happens so this whole thing that i was doing in the array i'm going to do here and i'm copying what am i copying i'm copying this the image coming in i'm copying this image is this the source or the destination this is the destination this is the source so i need the source width and height and then the destination is this image's size and then oh yeah yeah this is so why why didn't i do that this way before then this should all go here and brightness is the average of all the of all the pixels and this is not all images i this is that image so basically my object is taking care of this complicated scenario where i am going to make a image tile and you know what i think out of that image and then all images dot add that tile otherwise it's not a valid image now this is something else that's going on um so now none of this is gonna work and then there's this other thing bright images.length oh it's looking for the one so this is this i actually don't want to do but i want to do something different like the way that i made this photo mosaic because it had one image per brightness value and i probably want to keep track of multiple ones but i guess i should just to get something working here um just to get something working here looking at the chat it didn't declare scale i think scale is a global variable it doesn't really make sense for it to be but it's just a global variable um so what was this so bright images is the 255 array 256 array okay absolute value of i minus um oh go through all images dot size then this would be all images get j dot brightness that would be the equivalent here and then i guess the bright image would be all images get j its image okay so this should be and y is there and this should happen after this so i think i have an extra bracket so i think this might in theory do something that works now i mean this is definitely going to break right because i think oh wait no why why why is image tile does not exist yes it does oh image tile image tile okay okay uh the type of expression must be an array type oh all images i this is just that particular image okay try this again ladies gentlemen everyone that that doesn't include also there's gonna be a better way to say that y'all i present to you my p5 community contribution is one coding challenge followed by a blank thumbnail that is amazing okay i'm gonna take a break so this is a good start this is a good good start so uh we're gonna have to think about how to improve this uh what time is it it's 11 40. i've got another hourish to go um i should probably check my oh i'm going to take a break where i get to like check my messages and make sure everything's okay um but before i take my break don't go anywhere because i'm coming back to make this way more exciting and i need you i need you to help me and i also need to help me i need my friends over at brilliant the coding train today is sponsored by brilliant what is brilliance you might be asking yourself i mean if you've watched the coding train before you know about brilliant because i talk about it a lot it is a website it is an app and if i could get my act together here i'm going to i'm very excited because i have a new way to show you brilliant oh but i have these buttons here so i'm going to switch over to just play something right now and let's go to this one this is one of my favorite brilliant courses um and it's showing it is about how to work through algorithms and code you can see here it's under the topic of conditional algorithms interactive lessons so unlike just being there watching me on video talk talk talk talk talk talk draw draw draw draw draw you can really get your hands in there on your own time relaxed uh with your computer with your tablet with your phone you can go through interactive lessons on courses on geometry and computer science and so so so much more um i need to get back to those coding challenges what's the what's a great place for me to get a whole bunch of ideas for coding challenges brilliant is a great place for that so um if you will bear with me for a moment i am going to um go over here but i just want to go to my camera view i'm going to try something new here i'm very excited about this i'm going to i should have had this setup ready to go earlier let me go to new movie recording um but i'm going to yes get my ipad and then i'm going to go over here and open up brilliant so now i have for you uh the um brilliant um there's a truck here but that's okay um i have for you here the brilliant app so um you can see courses that i'm going through beautiful geometry is one geometry fundamentals i can i can make this larger just by uh zooming into it these are four that i am in the process of wonderful courses uh popular courses here we've got logic scientific thinking computer science fundamentals prealgebra and all of these include 60 plus courses all of them include interactive lessons math science computer science oh my god so much good stuff and a casino probability oh i'm excited about that you know if you like random numbers like me look at all these statistics and probability courses so amazing oh so much more stuff that i'm discovering so i'm scrolling through here um i think what i want to do i was looking at this this morning is i'm going to go to today and let's take a look at oh let's take a look at the daily challenge um um this one actually would be really good so both of these are good let's let's actually do i'm gonna do the random darts one i went through earlier and uh looked at this yellow triangle one and i was excited to try to solve it because i think all i need is the knowledge of the pythagorean theorem but uh i see this random darts one and i think this is one of the things that i love to do with brilliant and in these sponsor segments is i like to take one of their lessons and use it as an opportunity to code a p5.js sketch to find the solution so of course i could often calculate through some mathematical formula or through intuition what the answer is but with this one i think i can make a p5 sketch so i'm going to give myself five or ten minutes to work through this um i probably should mention though of course that i would if you're interested in following along and doing these challenges and participating you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain if you do that it lets them know that you found out about brilliant for me it helps me out um and then um you know you can do a lot of the um a lot of these the content is available for free and then of course there is a premium subscription to unlock all of their courses and a 20 off through that link now let's let's take a look at this problem chelsea is playing darts on a dart board made of four concentric squares whose colors alternate blue and yellow the side length of the outermost square is eight with each smaller square the side length rises by two so she closes her eyes throws a dart toward the dartboard and hears that it is hit assuming the dart has an equally likely chance of landing anywhere on the board what is the probability it landed on blue so i could work this out by knowing the formula for an area of a square and then understanding you know how much of a given square is colored blue what is taken out by yellow then added again but um and i would like one of the things that was fun that i did last time is i'm going to end this poll and i'm going to put a new poll in so come on let me put a new poll in scroll down do i need to refresh the chat uh yes okay so i'm going to ask what is it that we're doing here we're looking for a probability of blue probability of blue the answers are 2 out of 5 1 out of 2 5 out of 8 or three out of four and so what i'm going to put that poll up oh my god that is very loud i'm going to put a poll up and i'm going to see the results it might take a minute for it to show up and what i'm going to do right now is i am going to create a p5 sketch to simulate the actual throwing of the darts this is actually very similar to one of my pi day coding challenges where i approximated the value of pi by simulating throwing darts at a circle drawn in p5 so let's start with 400 by 400 and let's look at what is um oh let's look at this again so i have it over here uh the last side length of the outermost square is eight with each smaller square the side length decreases by two so let's make this um i think i could do the math in my head right so this is like 400 if so so if the first square which is blue and let's do rect mode center if the first square is blue um 200 200 400 400 let's uh right so that's blue oh i made it kind of like a so that first square is blue then i need to go and reduce i the next one should be yellow which i will just do red i'm just going to use simpler colors for rgb values i guess i could fill it with like yeah let's just do this though and now erect oh i don't need to say wreck mode center and now it if reduce it by 2 means 800 would go to 600 so 400 would go to 300. so this is really by the way square and i don't need the last argument and square and i don't need the last argument by the way why ask yourself an interesting question why did it suddenly show up as a circle when i had that last argument so that last argument for rectangles is the rounding of the corner for a rounded rectangle and i don't know if this is like the radius of the rounding so with a really big radius of the rounding it's basically a circle which is kind of interesting okay so then we need a another so obviously i could do this with a loop or but i really only need to do uh one more 200 um and what happened to that oops the first one i didn't mean to i meant to copy it so 400 and then i need one more and just to like you can see what i'm doing i'm recreating this diagram and um 100 and this one should be red oops no i've been working in processing so my key commands okay so now i've recreated this diagram so now all i need to do is pick any random pixel and determine whether it is red or blue and i should say no stroke and then i should just look at the ratio of how many times i'm picking red or blue out of the total number of pixels so i actually need to check if it's blue so i should be able to do i'm going to do this in draw because it'll be fun to see it calculate this in real time so uh let's do let's first do a um i'm gonna make a probability paragraph probability paragraph equals create p um let's put zero then i'm the zero in it now you can't see it because the background is dark here in this high contrast mode so i think i should be able to say uh style font color is that or is it text color text color i do not know css somebody tell me what it is color probably just color yes just color and then uh style font size 64 point okay great uh and let's just make this a div so it's um showing up there okay so now in draw uh i'm gonna in draw which this is in draw i'm going to take get a random x y value so let x equal floor random with let y because i need a random height so i need an x and a y i need them to be integers because i'm looking up a pixel and um i need the range so floor takes off the decimal point and i need the range between zero and the width and zero in the height so now i should be able to just say get for the color so the function get in p5 just gets the pixel value at a particular pixel location and i forgot what format i'm getting it back in so let's just do this oh it's on auto refresh let me just say no loop for a moment so it doesn't loop and run it ah so beautiful i'm getting an array so actually since i've drawn this i can just check is the zero one two element blue if color equals um if color index 2 equals 255 then and so i need a count i need total is zero and blue count is zero so then i want to increase the blue count by one and then let a probability equal blue count divided by uh the total and always increase the total i could use the frame count so let's do that and then i want to say probability p which is actually a div so it doesn't matter but it's going to bother me forever so the probability div is probability div equals uh dot html is i'm a number format this is one of my favorite functions in p5 by the way number format it lets you take a particular value and then say like i want only one leading digit and let's say three decimal places so you can see i'm always going to get that and it picked a blue one so it's 100 no it's zero well i need to take no loop out and now we should see it converge over time um so over time it should converge to and let's looks like it's converging to maybe 0.65 let's look at the poll by the way 5 out of 8 is winning so you all thought 5 out of 8. so what is 5 divided by 8 4 out of 8 is one out of eight is point one five right so five divided by eight is point six five six two five oh yeah yeah point one two five so six two five so why am i i would think that i would get quite a bit closer so there's probably some issue with like maybe if with like uh like a single pixel that i'm missing um i'm just curious so i think we know the answer but it kind of bothers me i wonder if the stroke would really make a difference here stroke and then if it were blue and by the way i don't need to do them in yeah i do need to do them in this order because that's the order that i'm drawing them um so let me just try adding the strokes in to see if that really changes anything to get it a little bit more accurate um and so this should go uh here because there might be sort of like one pixel off and this should go here okay let's see over time if that helps anything yeah so i think look at this i'm really converging i mean it this is not an exact science the pseudo random number generator of p5 i mean i could have gone through and checked every pixel i don't have to do it random so that's another way i could do it i could have done it one pixel at a time that's i would love to do that right now i'm gonna leave that as an exercise for you what if you count every single pixel um oh come on i want to do that i want to do that i don't see that but but you get the idea like this is what this is one of the reasons why i think you should also join brilliant is you can find these puzzles you can find these challenges you can go through these courses um you know you could work out the math like i'm going to go over here uh and um i'm going to first let's answer it 5 8 and uh i got it correct um let's look at show explanation and you can see here um you know this is a nice way where we could literally count up all of the red versus yellow blue versus yellow tiles we could work out a formula and you can see the probably the dart lands on blue is 40 out of 64 or 5 out of 8. so of course this was a much simpler problem that i made it but in so many cases so many of these courses um lead to of course the daily challenges the lessons in the courses lead to so many wonderful beautiful ideas for creative coding and visualization so if you like generative art if you like coding you're also going to like brilliant please consider signing up at brilliant.org codingtrain and i will um you could do that while i take a break um and i will be back in about five minutes to continue uh creating this incredible coding train communic catalog contribution for the processing community catalog um give me a couple minutes to take a short break drink some water check to make sure gloria is okay and then i'll come back and i've got about a half an hour or ish or so more to try to get this further along and there we go okay everybody i'm gonna put on some music and be right back do do do do do do do do okay i believe i am back hi gloria oh she's looking at me like please when are you going to finish she really wants me to take her outside and wander around you can go sit in the sun it's right there i need definitely need the dog cam so you can see who i'm talking to um all right so uh if you're just tuning in right now um what i am doing is i'm making a contribution to the processing community catalog and um the reason i am doing this is um well one is i would like to make my own contribution but i would also like to encourage you to make your own contribution so i'm here i am making one soliciting your input showing you how to code some stuff i mean you probably want to make something completely different than what i'm doing um but i just want to point out today i mean i'm a little bit late to send you this reminder because the deadline is tonight uh at 11 59 pm uh pacific time so if you're on the east coast like me uh you've you've got uh you've got till 3 a.m but regardless you have i don't know 12 more hours or more than that um 12 15 more hours um so um now so what am i attempting to do so the idea that i started with is to make some type of collage of coding trained thumbnails and the goal there was to um have it be what am i trying to say uh maybe have it then that collage also represents some larger uh design maybe just the letter p and the letter five or the p5 logo so i'm not very far and i'm not gonna be live streaming all day and i'm gonna try to work on this more so at probably at 12 30 when it says 12 30 everyone should sound the alarm in the chat and i should make sure to start working on putting everything on github documenting things so that anybody who wants to today could help me out or just run the code themselves or contribute ideas and the issues because i'm going to as i have little bits of time the rest of today all the way up until 3 a.m i will continue to work on this so where am i so far so first thing i did is i'm using youtube dl to download a whole bunch of thumbnails at some point i want to try to download all of my thumbnails if anybody happens to do that uh let me know and maybe i can put put make like a you could share it with me on dropbox or google drive or something um but um so that's one thing you could help with uh and then the other thing is and i have a plug that i want to make about the new coding train website but i've got some momentum here so don't let me forget that either this this is no longer um the obama stuff is from a previous example so if i run this what do i get wait what just happened why is this broken now what is going on hold on uh let's save close too many things open um let's try opening this uh no no no not now open with processing i want to open it with processing four there we go certainly this could be done with p5 but i'm working with processing and like what what is going on here what is going on on my computer just decide to like stop working all right let me open up just in case there's something going on with processing beta no okay thank you very much let me just try processing three for a moment and see what's going on here uh let's see what happens there we go okay so i don't know why some of these images are not working so weird so but i guess i'm not gonna i'm not gonna worry about that right now how can i do this like with a try catch or something how do i know if the image is invalid i just need a little error handling in here so i'm trying uh like a like a little try catch armor bob it's a way of like try this code if there was an error do something else and i'm just gonna say so okay i should be back um so uh for once i am prepared i put in i put in fresh batteries into my lav mic um i need to get good rechargeable batteries or a different solution and i don't know why but the fresh batteries did not make it through this whole stream on this one the the receiver is still uh oh it's very low so this receiver the fresh batteries didn't last well anyway i have backup batteries so but i think i better mute myself it's going to happen again any moment because this one is about to die now too i'll be right back okay so i have um i do have rechargeable batteries but they weren't lasting so i feel like they're quite old like i've had them for years so i just figured maybe i need new rechargeable batteries they wouldn't last for like a couple hours i had them charged up and i put in fresh batteries that are not rechargeable batteries that didn't last i don't know what's going on but i should be all okay now um all right so um now what is going on here uh let's just what is going on can i first of all i this is driving me crazy that the console font size is so big i'm just going to make that smaller and then let's get rid of this try catch and i'm going to say if if image dot i mean this is not something i should need to do but i'm just going to say if i have more than one pixel then go ahead it's a valid possible tile that is very strange oh the only reason i think it's only getting one image or no it's only got one image it's so strange oh my god what is going on why why does it not want to load these images i think only this last one like works all right hold on just deleting them all come on uh save at duplicate save as image one like i don't know what the format of these images that processing can't really like read it let's do save image one okay now let's see what happens here what is going on stop oh like like this should not be the complicated part i just have two images like just two test images image one dot jpeg and image2.jpg just two images it's all i'm asking you to do is load two image files is there uh okay so can i clear the console look it like okay quit hold on for the reason like like processing loading the bad images like everything dies so let's quit processing why must why do things not work oh chris you made it hope your meeting was good i mean these should just be jpegs okay okay here we go oh all right success so if i have two images that load properly then i will get one is darker and one is brighter so the darker one will inevitably end up trying to be the p5 and the brighter one will and the brighter one will inevitably be the background so that makes sense because i have the source image that i am working with has a bright background and a darker p5 so again we're just trying to get like a proof of concept going eventually i need i would like this p5 to look nicer i would like to use many many many images trying to get there so the next thing i would like to do is make this kind of full size so i think if i do um void settings um i can then have a size that's calculated um based on i'm just going to call this like a factor so i don't want to go all the way up to i just i don't want to go all the way up eventually i need my factor to be 10 because i want the image that i'm going to produce to be this number of pixels but that's not going to show up really well for me to be able to see it so let's just say times factor times factor and that did not work oh because the image i'm loading the image i'm loading has to be this scale like i didn't write anything into it to account for that um smaller why am i making this ah no no no i want it based on the size of the window so i want to copy the p5 image whatever size it is so i want to make that larger i guess that's very strange there we go i mean there's got to be like a better way of doing this but now we can see um that's the thumb now the thing is i sort of feel like maybe i shouldn't be making them squares it's like i'm requiring it to be a square whereas these images but i'll worry about that later so i get 32. okay let's try it a factor of three okay uh factor of four all right i'm starting not to be able to fit it on my screen anymore but you get the idea so the improvements i need to make and take a screenshot of the new p5 logo will have more variations of gray values yeah but i think ultimately i don't necessarily care so much i think i might be able to get this to work by just having bright and dark ones and tiling them because i have so many thumbnails like right the thing that i want to do right now is what if i have a third i'm trying to think of how to approach this and i don't have a lot of time because i need to wrap this up in about 10 minutes so obviously i won't be finished with my contribution but i'm only getting so far uh today i'm trying to think of where do i want to go with this i think the main thing that i want to do is um allow myself i mean maybe right now actually i need to have a i just want to like threshold it i want to allow myself to pick multiple images so i still don't understand why why can't why didn't this not work to get multiple all like thumbnails um all right let's go back to youtube dl for a second write all the maybe i should just do write all thumbnails lists thumbnails oops let's see what's going on aha i see so let me just stop sometimes where was where is one that has the oh yeah so sometimes there's a format four which is max res default web p would this work by the way to say maxresdefault.jpg no but i could download it as web p and then convert it using but let's just get one more so i need to figure out getting the images later let's just get one more or a couple more image three and i'll convert that manually and i'll get one more let's try this one because it's this is good because it's got a very different like kind of brightness value let's call it image four so obviously i will oh no use webp um i will need to figure out some way some automatic way to duplicate save as jpeg image three i can use ffmpeg or some other script or figure out figure out some other way to download a whole get to collect a data set of thumbnails or maybe i actually just want to use screenshots from the examples we'll see but now i have four images so if i run this right now it's only got oh no it picked more than two amazing so it picked more than two because probably in the sort of compression of the image or in the in the antialiasing of the edges of the p5 um there's like some slight variation of gray so that's kind of interesting so i guess what i could do is just make a much noiser but regardless i want to be able to right now i only am using one image per brightness value so what i want is this i want this bright images to be a uh i want for every grayscale value i want to have multiple choices so i'm going to say this is this is a array of arraylists right every image every element of the bright images array is a list of possible image options this is kind of nuts so bright images is a new array list of um image tiles and there are 256 of them no is arraylist image tile so why does it not like this what cannot create a generic array each element of this array is an image tile arraylist um do i need to do like this no each element is oh wait no how do i what's the syntax for this i'm looking at the chat how do i how do i make an array of arraylists that should be right like this is if this were integers i would say new int i mean obviously that doesn't work does not match java.util.array yeah this is right so why is it i mean can i just do this for a moment yeah so this is fine all right i think actually so i can do this and then i should be able to say for every bright images.size oh no no length it's still length bright images index i is a new arraylist of image tiles hopefully this is going to work yes and then i don't need to get then i just need to find every image i'm going to just find every image that's within like five within 10 pixels of that brightness value so that's like a threshold and then i don't so there's no idea of a record anymore like are you within and then i'm going to add it so no but i'm just going to add the tile okay so basically instead of every slide don't have my i took my phone out of there i would love to diagram this uh oh it's complaining because of the code at the bottom using it incorrectly says chris that's interesting oh and prothems is showing me okay okay so i think i might be fine anyway but prathamesh in the chat just gave me um where is it where did i do that arraylist no but that's an arraylist of arraylists oh you know what it is i think it's this no no all right i'm not going to worry about it because you should rank each image you have based on how close is that threshold then splice them out as they're used ah that's a great idea but i don't have more images than spots right now so i'll do that later because i only have three images so again i'm i'm really looking for people to help me with this throughout the day but i can't i don't have all day to like live stream i gotta i gotta deal with a lot of stuff and pick my kids up from school but i will be able to like come back to work on this in pockets so there won't so join the discord this is a little plug join the discord join the membership stuff all of that i'm going to put this on github you know my alarm is about to go off in about four minutes in my head so let me just get a little further with this so right now i'm just gonna do anything within 10 pixels is going to get added or within that threshold and then the problem is and i'm just going to make the threshold like 255 right now so anything so like everything will get added everywhere so there's no holes and then when i go through and get the image index i should be able to get an array list of image tiles i'll call it options is from that bright image images array naming here is terrible and then i can say let me pick something random random index equals int random options.size boy welcome to java everybody so then my image the actual image is from my options get random index dot image because remember i have this image tile that has its brightness value which i'm not really using ah so i don't need that array i just have all my image tiles and i should go and try to find a bunch of so there's a lot of other ways i could do this because it can run really slow i could actually just search through the image tile options here but i'm running out of time so let's just draw oh i like by the way let's first of all let's just put this in here for a second just to see i forgot that i had this for debugging which was like let's just actually see what i'm working with here this is actually what i'm working with here so you can see there's very minimal grayscale kind of options but something to start with now let's put the uh image oh let's put the images in let's see if this works this is the random image that i picked now this should look just totally like a mess because i made the threshold 255 so i only have three image options and i'm getting a random one for every tile and i think now if i make the threshold so ideally i want the threshold to be like five but i think i'm going to get errors because not every brightness value is going to have an image within five pixels of it so right again i have to work on this more today so many ways to improve it but let's just kind of like see like how on what threshold will get me there uh let's try 50 150 there we go there see 150 kind of got me there again this is not a thoughtful way of doing this but i got it i mean so now i just need a lot more images a better interesting more source image and i think i'm i'm on my way and if i had another hour to live stream i would keep going with that so because i don't i'm going to do the following let's go to github and please be logged in so please bear with me as i log into github it's only going to take me about 45 minutes with all of my oh that's nice that i had that saved i need my two factor um so let me just do this for a second authenticator this actually is not taking that long i am verified i am in i am going to make a new repo we're calling this coding train processing or coding train we'll just call this processing catalog contribution uh my coding train processing community catalog contribution uh add a readme file choose a license right now i mean i've lots of thoughts about licenses but i'm just going to do this let us go ahead and bring this down i'm going to say i'm going to clone that repo i'm going to open up my folder here and bring this into it oops it's really loud i need a git ignore file i'm going to use nano which is a little text editor that i can put in here um okay i mean i really should ignore the jpegs but i need some sample ones so it's going to upload with these okay so um everything is here let me let me make some issues of things that i need to do a better source image what should the overall design be like maybe also a coding train character so i could try something like that uh you know like post links to your ideas here and just remember the dimensions should be um basically this 225 by aspect ratio oops aspect ratio is 225 by 300 okay so that's one thing now the other thing is what uh database of images should it be all thumbnails would love help downloading them all you know post i'm sorry this is very hard for you to see um post your youtube dl command sequence commands here or links to a drive or dropbox etc folder of images thank you these are things i need help with but another idea i have another idea is another idea maybe the images shouldn't be thumbnails but actual uh snapshots of sketches themselves which can be configured to conform to a color for any given pixel i'm not sure if that makes any sense but in other words oh my camera went out oh so sad everything is falling apart here at the end um um all right so what am i going to do here i so little time just going to just going to let the camera charge up a little bit i'm definitely going to have to be more mindful of making sure my camera is fully charged for whatever reason the power i have it plugged into is not enough to keep it on and i'm just going to go to here for a second so just listen to me talk so my idea here is that maybe and someone could please post this to the youtube chat and oh my god it's so loud um maybe lawn mowers and the boiler is going here in the garage so much going on where is gloria um i really have to stop maybe maybe i just keep saying maybe over and over again like my brain will start working uh you know we could actually run i could just run a lot of sketches and have them be very specific colors and create a huge database of images that way i could even name them with their rgb values there's lots of possibilities here so if you would like to contribute to this and i'm hoping that even just giving it like a minute will allow me to wrap up this live stream um if you would like to contribute to this you don't need to do a pull request you certainly could but you know you can set i'm i'm i'm really going to be paying attention to this today so you could just post your ideas or quick little algorithms in the issues um you could do a pull request with an entirely additional folder with a sketch so i don't know how easy it is going to be to like take incremental community improvements to just this one sketch and who knows if anybody's actually interested in helping make this today so i'm just going to work on it on my own and think just do the best that i can but um uh you know just stay in touch and that's my plug here for you to join the discord um so the discord is a place where you can get help and ask questions um there's a there's a set of like supporter channels if you sign up for a youtube membership but um actually the main thing that i want to highlight here is the coding train website is going under a major transformation a really exciting project that probably won't launch until like january but um we're looking for a lot of feedback and user testing of the new sites rather than trying to decide like what kind of language to use and we're getting feedback about different design ideas so please join i mean one thing i just want to say is like let's put this link somebody please post this the link to this form in the youtube chat right now but join the discord to stay tuned for notifications about the website fill out this form it'll take you literally like 30 seconds to answer a few questions about naming i really would like your feedback on that um so i just wanted to mention that before i go and while some of you are still here watching and uh uh profit mesh is giving me more ideas about how to to get the syntax of arraylist arraylist i will work on that offline so i think that's pretty much everything i have to say today i'm sorry to be like rushing out of here um eventually things will change and uh well um you know i'm just i'm learning as i go i've been doing this for years still feel like i'm not doing it right uh new nature of code videos coming out next live stream it won't be this coming monday almost certainly but it'll be a week from today or a week in a few days from today it'll be either be mondays and fridays morning that's when i'll be live streaming i'm gonna sit just sort of look at the chat for a minute as i kind of clean up here and put on some music to say goodbye um thank you all uh for joining thank you for all the nice comments and constructive feedback and criticism i know everybody's waiting for more coding challenges i'm going to try to get back into doing that um i got to work on this new studio i got a lot to do thank you for your patience with me um and i'll see you all next time on the coding train as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stuff i don't know i got some feedback that there should be more dancing i'm just going to be looking at the chat here to see if anybody has any ideas um and the url for contributing is here oh you don't see that oh and let me also just quickly mention thank you to brilliant for sponsoring today it's codingtrade sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain unlock all the premium content all of their courses uh 20 off uh thank you brilliant thank you to viewers and see you next time this dot this dot song never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me and i'm going to say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me cartesian coordinate song it's the polar cartesian coordinate song unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it sorry everybody having some technical issues grab glorious the kittens kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again
