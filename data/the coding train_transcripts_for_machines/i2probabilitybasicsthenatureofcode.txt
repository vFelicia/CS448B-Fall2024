okay hello okay uh there's a exists warmer and warmer the more you're in here it sucks losing clothing this is where having to stop though processing tshirt okay hello again here we are um okay so this video I want to talk about probability really basic really simple topic this is not some elaborate five minute video about complex statistics we really want to just think about probability in a very basic way I should say something kind of about this which is I I forgot in my original video and suddenly when I go back and remake all these to be perfect I will get this right that one of the things about this material is we aren't looking for scientific accuracy we're not uh we're not here to you know measure perfectly and recreate with with amazing realism the exact simulated representation of what happens in nature on the screen I have a screen over that I have to turn off because I keep looking at it okay right that's how we're here to do we are here to may have to create the feeling of nature in our programs sometimes that means hey look at the science understand the science right the science into our code sometimes it means blend some weirdlooking images we made a Photoshop together to kind of create the feeling of nature I think probability and randomness is a place where we're kind of walking that line a little bit we can use randomness to sort of have this accidental representation of nature in many ways lots of things in nature are random but are they purely random do they have a pattern do they follow Gaussian distributions of random numbers should we use this sort of strange function that produces a smooth madness let's Perlin noise want to look at all these topics but we're going to just start with probability now let's go over here and visit or they were going to visit our random walker it's been running for quite a while and we can see that it's creating this kind of nice random patterns kind of that's how I would describe it um and it's working out quite nicely so what is the thing what how does this random walker relate to probability okay now we see over here this is this is a set of options that a random Walker at any moment will can choose from it can go to the right to the top is the left over to the bottom with equal probability a 25 one out of four chance of moving to the right a one out of four chance of moving to the top left and bottom that's a 25% chance each and in fact when we use the random function and processing for example if we want to pick a random number a random integer and I think we did this in our code this will give us a 0 1 2 or 3 we have an equal probability of picking any one of those a 25% chance of 0 20% and 1 2 3 so this is where we start to realize hmm is this how nature works for example what if we wanted to pick random Heights we're going to create a population of meerkats and we're going to give them all a random height now I don't really know if you compare cats though it's probably a bad example to pick but I have a guess when will the meerkat experts will weigh in in the interactive commenting system we have below which I don't know if it exists and tell me about this whether or not I'm right or not ok let's say we could pick meerkats with the height of 0 1 2 or 3 we'll have 0 also doesn't make any sense but just go with this it's more likely that most of the meerkats meerkats all have a height of around 1.5 right somewhere in the middle there the mean right maybe there are rare very rarely some outliers that are very tall or very short and perhaps the meerkats follow this kind of bell curve a Gaussian distribution a normal distribution of of numbers of heights and so I got that's going to be stay tuned this is coming soon and in the next video for you we're going to talk more about how this works and we're actually looking at doing a Gaussian distribution of random numbers in processing but before we get there let's just think of some simpler ways we might do this what if for example we want to adjust these probabilities what if we wanted to say that our random Walker has actually a 50% chance of moving to the right and it has a 20% chance of moving to the left a 15% chance of moving up and a 15% chance of moving down these could I hope that that's up 200 hit us if I'm wrong I'm wrong how could we implement something like this in processing we need to figure out how to have custom distributions of random numbers now this computer over here went to sleep which means I'm standing in front no came back online this program down here is going to give us a clue if you look at this is a particle system it's an example that's coming up in a chapter on chapter week lesson video whatever in the particle system section which is chapter 4 if you're following along in the nature code book notice how often it's making a particle definitely not every frame and certainly not with regularity we can't say particle particle particle notes particle particle particle particle it's making every a particle every frame with I would guess actually because just put an example a 1% chance how do we have something in processing happen with just 1% of the time look at this code now we haven't done all this stuff all this stuff is going to be we're going to get later but we're looking at this line right here if random 1 is less than 0.01 let's write that a different way if random 100 is less than 10 here we're picking a random number between 0 and 100 how often will that random number be less than 10 10 percent of the time well 1 or less than 1 1 percent of the time well we could also say random 1 less than 0.01 same thing so this is a way that we could just even begin to start to affect our random Walker we could actually if we go look over here again we could see here is our random Walker a traditional where we go down here and look here are the choices 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 or 3 4 options equal probability each time and if I go to this particular example we can say hey what if that random number we pick it's less than point 4 go to the right it's less than 0.6 go to the left these are slightly different probabilities 40% of going to the right 20% going up 20% going down and 20% going to going back to the left and if I run this we'll see what this random Walker does we can see it's generally speaking going to the right now what effect out of me like these are not some well before my heads in front of it I'll just go stand over here these are not earthshattering examples ah hello these are not earthshattering examples but these basics will get you started to understanding something about probability I don't want these videos to be too long so I'm going to stop this one and this is just sort of the basics of creating event probability and processing and what could you do with that random Walker could you get it to exhibit some type of pattern that has randomness built into it what could you do that would be even you know that could get it to do something a little bit more I know that has a quality of something you're seeing Elston I'm not sticking up if you get a script and a director to make up we want you're better so so that's that that's that's the end of this one and so think about that and we're going to look in the next couple video series about actually looking at Gaussian random numbers and Perlin noise which I think will allow us to do quite a bit more stuff ok I'm going to hit stop
