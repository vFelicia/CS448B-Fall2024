e e hello welcome to the coding train and as we always do we begin with our ceremonial reading from the book The Great Book of random numbers 20416 is everything working on today's live stream I think it is I don't see anybody saying it's not 87410 75 646 64 176 8 2752 63606 3711 573 46 69512 56464 Hi how are you oh I am feeling very tired today but I am getting myself going and ready to live stream about a topic that I don't feel too good about um I'm a little confused how to approach this topic um but I'm going to make an attempt and I'm G to play around with some very new features that are part of ml5 JS but maybe this is the first time you're watching me or the coding train which are kind of the same thing I suppose and you might want to understand where you are so this is uh first of all this is YouTube It's a website with videos on it it's got a lot of really amazing stuff A L I don't know this is not I am not here to evaluate the merits of YouTube but I am here what can I just please start over hold on I didn't start over this this is a disaster hello happy Friday welcome to the Cod train my name is Dan uh I come here I soon to be probably on Thursdays but for the foreseeable future until I say so I am here on Fridays live streaming coding challenges coding tutorials a lot of nonsense and wasted time that's why I like to start reading from my book of random numbers just to emphasize that there might not be a lot of value in what you're about to watch may maybe you'll find it entertaining maybe it will brighten your day maybe it's on in the background maybe you might learn something who knows any of these reasons uh there apparently is a coding Garden raid going on in the chat I have arrived this old internet fogy has now arrived I was making videos before YouTube was even a website um no I wasn't actually was I I was actually I did make some videos before this is not the point of what I'm saying but I feel very excited that I entering the culture the streaming the culture the streaming culture of today's content creators and I am seeing here people raing the chat from coding garden with CJ um uh oh okay hold on got to do some serious notification shutting off of here uh okay check my messages this is what you this is what everybody does when they live stream when you have like a lot of people tuning in live to watch you do a coding tutorial you just pause for a minute and check your messages okay so this is why I'm checking because I was checking to make sure that I have a babysitter who picks up my son from school on Fridays at 330 p.m. so that um to um uh so that I don't have to so that I can live stream um and I was checking to make sure that was confirmed for today and apparently it is not so I have to continue checking my messages and if that is the case I will have to rush out of here at about uh fortunately my son's school is very very close to where I am right now so you know even if I even if I shut the streaming off at 320 PM I'd make it by 330 but I would the ra go CJ's tell me the raid concept originated on twish did I pronounce that correctly twsh no maybe oh do I have some news in the world of coding train to tell you about train breaking news breaking news there is a brand new coding train merchandise store that I am excited low audio so uh can I please just complete a thought without looking at the chat moving on to something else um thank you for telling me about the low audio I had an issue last week welcome Karan Pawa to the passengers of the coding train so I had an issue last week where the audio in the recorded version was peing a lot and you'll notice when I release the next edited video of my poset and regression that the audio isn't so great so um I uh turn it down down so that it wouldn't do that um can everybody turn their audio up while you're watching today and then hopefully actually let me do so let me record let me turn the recording on um let me turn this recording on and I will check it in a little bit also so I just need to turn on the multiorder which is now going minimize that here I am back all right so some people are telling me the audio is fine it is it is low lower than it was last week and that's on purpose so I'm going to keep it the way it is um and hopefully it'll be fine um what was I talking about ah yes breaking news new coding train store which I am now going to uh um I got a Super Chat question that I'll answer because I can't resist that uh how long have you been programming seriously and how long do you take over the world uh seriously I have been programming there's a few different answers to this question so probably the first code that I wrote we got to go way back 1984 85 somewhere around there basic apple 2 plus does that I sound like I have the years about right there could have been a little bit earlier somewhere in the early 80s Apple 2 some Basics so that was the first code I wrote next would have been I think I took some kind of programming course in middle or high school I believe if I'm correct the programming language I used was assembly Lang language this is to indicate the passage of time then we would have to go way fast forward all the way to about maybe 97 98 late 90s I took an evening course in C++ didn't take I this is not for me I don't know what I'm doing here I do not understand this then we get to 2001 I enter as a student at the interactive telecommunications program at New York University's TI School of the Arts where I am standing right now uh of course it actually isn't where I'm standing right now because it was in a different building then but you know you get the idea and I learned uh the lingo programming language um with uh in a course called introduction computational media that's in the macr media director environment um I'm gonna get start getting through this a little bit faster um which incidentally was invented by John Henry Thompson if you're you're not familiar with John Henry Thomson he came and visited the coding train and talked about his work Google his name and find out uh about his contributions to computer science really amazing wonderful fellow um and uh would you mind doing oh yes David I will do the community contributions before you but please don't pay me to do that I gotta TR I think I might just have to turn the super chats off membership I appreciate it makes me very the super chats make me uncomfortable I mean it helps it helps I appreciate appreciate it um um but yes I will do those uh I'm going to do those as soon as I get through the story so macr media director I took a Java class I did C and C++ I learned a to 95 I took a course in the computer science program at NYU um then I just in 2003 I discovered processing and that sort of like took over for the next 10 years until I started doing JavaScript probably around 2013 2014 okay I'm going to come back to the door Ah that's what I was looking for drum roll who weird weird glitchiness this is going to have to wait because we will go to community contributions um so first of all let me just mention something really important coding train has a Discord I mean it has had a Discord for quite a while it just was an unofficial Discord and now it is a official Discord and yes this is a I cut myself I was uh doing the cardboard boxes for cycling and I just like sliced my finger on a cardboard box I didn't even know that was a thing that you could do that fortunately it's still attached and I have a nice little Pokemon BandAid I think this is a Charmander ah the Discord join the Discord there's a link in this video's description somebody who's an admin will hopefully post it into the chat um love to see you there um I am trying to be active and participate but there is a generous and wonderful community of people who are more active and know more about the stuff than I do there as well um now let's go to the Kaleidoscope snowflake Challenge and see so one of the things you can do so first of all in the Discord there is a share uh Channel if channel is the right term you can raid can you raid the can you ra read the Discord um there's a channel where you can share your work but also for permanent well until the apocalypse uh or until the website goes down which might happen before the apocalypse uh there for uh you can also submit a link to your work uh if it's related to one of the videos on the page for that video so there are one two three four five and I I one of these days I'll have a whole system for how I go through all this stuff um let me click through a bunch of these and take a look at them uh we're going to go just in order here snowflake make and share Firebase by Ashu to agal code. solar.com I've seen this before oh look at this so look at this wonderful tweet with all these different snowflakes oh and I can design my own oh I love it so this is like a nicer interface with like a Color Picker it looks like it's got the same kind of symmetry that I did in my snowflake video then I can save it and I can give it a title like done live or live on coding train and shmon uh save to Firebase saving saving to a database that's so cool uh and then I can also look at all these other ones that are popular or not popular and you can like them awesome beautiful work thank you for this um let's look at this color and Pen weight controls by Ravi demon oh okay so this is looks very similar to mine but with this is using something called dat guy it looks like which we can change the Symmetry change the color with like a much nicer interface uh now this is like ninefold symmetry that is really nice clear and I could save which presumably downloads as an image I just erased my beautiful work Wonderful uh let me David has to go back to Works maybe so maybe I should start with his first not well third at this point so let me go to David uh and see oh look at this snowflake Creator don't tell me this background is full of all of the snowflakes that have been created with this Creator could that be true um so once again I can draw it has a I like this there's nice little sort of guide as to where the snowflake should be here in this circle I can change the snowflake the weight so let's try something really thick here for like the center which I always think looks kind of nice and then I can change I can make a color whoa what's this oh I got like all these color Pickers so interesting so I can add a color and then if I close this now I'm drawing in that color cool and I can change the background color maybe and oh that's another color I don't know did I click on the wrong thing anyway I'm having lots of fun playing with this thank you for creating this and this amazingly I'm kind of so surprised if I just click right here there I am P5 web editor all of the code lovely to see oh here's the color selector add class Color Picker create Color Picker one so I don't I'm I'm kind of like willfully not knowledgeable about actual web development so I'm always intrigued when I see people using these kind of features that are very common to a website uh David says it's just a snowing GIF but I will live for the rest of the day with the fantasy that this was a project where you design a snowflake and it enters a world of snowflakes falling because I love that idea all right now uh animated snowflake by Marcus uh whitly okay that is super cool whoa okay I have to think about this so first of all big difference between what my example does and this one is certainly that um some data structure has to keep track of all the points of the snowflake oh oh with the super chats oh you know how to you know how to bring out the guilt in me um so I uh moras moraki I will uh talk about the voron diagram in a moment and it is high on my list although very hard to get to all this stuff um so in my Kaleidoscope snowflake example code I never erase the background so just whatever the mouse is doing I'm painting color into the canvas at that moment in six times around uh in a circle so here I would have to memorize or store the path in an array draw all the points of the path with Symmetry and then apply some type of behavior to all the points which looks like maybe just moving out from the center so that's I'm speculating I I I just everything in my body just wants to like turn everything off and um thank you David Snyder for upgrading to conductor I keep whenever see a conductor I know I have the train thing I just think an Orchestra conductor um I just want to leave and like try to program this and play around with it or or or do this live but I've I've got to stick to my plan I have a plan which is not a good one but I made it so I'm going to stick to it um one more and then let me address verono snowflake generator by clippy who I have seen quite a bit I think in the Discord oh look at this an embedded page on this page says who is this mysterious embedded page he's talking to me um while drawing the snowflake you have an onscreen indicator that locates the center of the drawing and lines that show the Symmetry and thickness of the brush once you export the image to another tab instructions below the indicators will disappear and the image will no longer be cut remember the Symmetry is represented as a green line on the right of the screen and you can change it with W or W Etc there's a q I can do something there's an E I can do something okay I I better look at those instructions again um I can erase my stuff like s a new tab will appear in the image thickness is repr the blue line I don't see the green line so this this the description leads me to believe um s oh look at that it opened it in a new tab and I can and made it into an image that's super interesting I wonder how that works um this is lovely um and there's apparently a lot of controls and things that I can do one thing I might suggest is the use of an alert for instructions uh you know I think there might be some more elegant ways to think about how that interaction is maybe an overlay that you can press like info not info because I sort of feel like I forgot what the keys were so I just want to like enable the instructions again so that might be I'm thinking oh Mike is asking how did the snake AI do I uh not very well um Mike made a snake AI that I think um uh yes I uh so many things in the chat this is why CJ has a really good system for dealing with the chat by looking at the messages one at a time said of all once in a crazy Caff um but um the Mike made a a really excellent snake AI neuro Evolution I think example which is a cing a contribution on if I'm right I mean might it actually maybe should be more on the Flappy Bird contribution page because maybe the the core um thing uh is the evolu the neuro Evolution and not the snake game itself but I think um I don't remember which snake game it's on is it on this one yeah it's right here so this let's just open it up so this is h i was I let this run for like 12 hours um and I think um it didn't get very far I think probably uh Mike if I were to suggest how you could get this to perform better would be that to sort of do away with the need I mean I love the visual here that I'm actually watching every game every attempt play one after another all in real time it's sort of sped up but it's real time so if you were to like play out all these simulations without having to draw them you could have a much higher population going and maybe you just show one at a time like an arbitrary one or you sort of like show the one from the previous generation that did the best um maybe you show a grid of them I think there's a lot of possibilities there okay verono it was was um moraki who asked can you do the verono diagram in a future segment please Dan thank you thank you for the please thank you for the thank you I appreciate it uh so a topic that I would really like to explore in depth on this channel is computational geometry and I was on a kick for it for like a week or two in the fall and if I recall I did gift wrapping challenge coding train um I did this uh convex whole gift wrapping algorithm I was I wanted to start by doing some more basic uh foundational computational geometry algorithms this is one of them and that's oh that was in July and that's uh all I got to so um and now I've been focusing on the machine learning stuff this fall this spring I'm going to focus on the uh simulation uh um nature of code uh chapters and examples this could kind of fit into that um I also have been wanting to do more of those Cabana videos and in a way of sort of thinking oh some of these more oneoff pretty algorithms that are visualized Mak sense in that context I sort of was doing them less here in the live streams but it's very hard to find the time to those command videos it's also very cold supposed to snow tomorrow so I really want to record one tomorrow if it snows so I think that would be fun so I do want to get to it um but uh the thing that I need want to do first and maybe I could just skip ahead to that there might be some others that are in between that should be in between this and that would be a Delany or Delani triangulation which also is a foundational piece of of doing a verono diagram even though there's many different um um different uh ways of of computing a veroni diagram and Simon points out that he created a GitHub issue it's on the rainbow topics repo issue number one 1436 which uh goes through some followup ideas in computational Geometry okay now back to the new coding train store and it's kind of a should say this is kind of a soft launch I think it's maybe missing um one or two more products that might be added and I think the designers might still be working on tweaking things a little bit but if you go to St standard. tvthe coding train or coding train I don't know which that should be which should it be the coding train or coding train let's try coding train and hit enter you will see the new coding train store and um and you know uh I was about to try to justify why I'm doing this but it's just a thing that exists that if you're interested in these things you you could buy them and I'm doing it as a thing for people who requested or might want these things don't buy the stuff if you don't want to if you're not interested don't contribute to capitalism and waste but if you know be pick and choose pick and choose if this makes it into your pick and choose list great um let me talk about some of the things that are here for sale uh I got it oh that's not the right thing to click I'm like trying to click on the monitor over here and oh because let me see if this works my overhead camera there we go ah oh hiding secret secret thing not so secret um so first of all there is the I'm like man I'm white no this is like the Q what's that um uh is it QVC I feel like I'm on QVC now this dices and slices oh and it's got water in it cating train is brought to you by oh brilliant.org thank you to uh brilliant.org for uh sponsoring today's live stream um you can check it out for free at brilliant.org coding Trin and uh you can get um uh 20% off a premium subscription uh if if you if you go through that link and you'll find more information did I say 20% off let's make sure I get this right I got it right oh you can't see because the overhead camera it says 20% behind there there we go um 20% off okay uh what was I doing store yes okay this is the mug that has water in it let me drink the water uh it says oh no no I showed it the wrong way coffee now is it upside down coffee now see this is my BandAid Charmander right refactoring later isn't that cute um then the thing that I'm really excited about are these notebooks invisible look at this we invented invisible notebooks what what what no um this is the coding train notebook I'll stand over here this is good uh you can see it's lovely cover here it's got a nice little back and when you open it up look it's graph paper can you see that I don't know it's graph paper it has the cute little characters so I it's got her little friends there in the corner so uh that's there was it upside down I can't tell anymore oh yeah it was upside down there we go sorry I'm looking at things in a weird s way there's the notebook here's the back so uh lovely little notebook those cute little characters okay graph paper I said that now what else do I got for you uh oh I don't have one of these so I think maybe I'm done with the overhead camera for a moment um there's a nice little pin and then there's these stickers um if you're interested in these stickers I do have a sheet of stickers here that I can show you um and I guess I could put them my overhead but my on my uh stream deck I don't have a button for the overhead camera so have to manually click the mouse um so you can see these lovely uh stickers here that you can um get all right I feel ridiculous so I've got to stop now um but the other thing I'm very excited about is I am attempting so you know I have this uh silly train whistle thing so this is a train whistle that purchased off Amazon I don't remember how much uh it costs it makes a really excellent sound um you know it must be tuned right there's four flutes basically I can show you here there's like four flutes um and you blow the air through here it's uh and it's nicely made then I have this other one because I ordered a a box of several hundred of these although I really should learn how to just use a CNC machine and make them myself um think I just need this to be like out a little bit more yeah so this is these are uh blank ones and I am learning how to use a laser cutter and I've been experimenting with um laser etching so you can see this was the first attempt uh was a little bit too harsh um and um this was the second attempt which is a little bit too light and I think this is the Goldilocks just about right but I was just putting the logo here I want to come up with a nice design and put it on all the different side these will not be for sale though these are for people who join uh there's different levels of membership if you see that join button on YouTube um if you're interested I'm trying to come up with exciting and clever and fun uh rewards what happened in your finger it was a cardboard box it came out out of nowhere it attacked me sliced my finger so there'll be a few more things coming soon and I will um uh talk about them next okay I don't want to I I don't want to spend too much time on this little announcement um all right someone that I'm forgetting their name um asked about processing Community day so let me take a minute to talk about that in my official capacity as a person who does stuff with the processing Foundation um and I can uh move that now day. processing. .org all right so um if you recall 2019 the first processing Community Day I think was in 2017 if I'm right about that but last year in 2019 was the first year we had something called processing Community Day worldwide meaning anyone anywhere in the world could organize their own processing Community day and this year we are leaning into that and EMP emphasizing it even more um and uh have a mentorship program for anyone who wants to organize a PCD so um sorry there's my mouse is here so um something that I think will so first thing that you should do if you're interested is these are all Recaps that were written by organizers of pcds from last year in other cities um you can read them for yourself here um then there's information about how you can host your own and what kind of support there's an organizer's kit there's going I think there's a slack Channel or some other ways of um engaging with the community um yeah slack workspace um but and organizer kit and more thing but I think probably what might interest you even more is to look at this map so let's take a look at it and we can see where different ones that have been scheduled already so I know that I think it was uh Ste in the chat had mentioned PCD Copenhagen uh organized by run Matson and Andreas refcard emails are here their Twitter handles Etc you can find out there's a website for it I don't know um this is I guess the date it was I don't know if it has oh date of the event whoa that's soon hey let's all go to Copenhagen let's do a coded Garden raid in person um so so check that out find one that's close to you that you can attend um and um if you don't find one that's close to you that you can attend maybe consider uh organizing one yourself and you can certainly reach out to me um and I would be glad to help you if I can but um pretty much I think what you want to do is um is uh use any of these mechanisms to ask questions to get mentorship to learn about how to organize a processing Community Day uh I'm hoping to go to as many of them as I can as of now I'm going to go to the one in New York City because I think that's February 8th um and I think you can register for it uh as of right now uh I think it's at like processing. NC maybe uh 2020 yep um the the schedule is just absolutely incredible uh if you look at it so you can find out more about it here and um asked you asked about PCD 2020 okay great all right now I have stalled long enough give me one moment to see if I have a babysitter picking up my son from school okay all right we're good everybody sorry now I'm going get my other messages stop I am not looking at my phone again bad oh don't nice hand just oh can we please shut it all off sometime all right so what's next let me do a quick check actually I don't think it's been a half an hour since I press record so I'll wait a little bit longer but I I don't know so a couple things one I don't have to leave at 330 which is good so I think 130 230 330 I think four is a good time if you if you're watching this right now and you're still here an hour and a half or so from now do me a favor and remind me to just like shut off the stream and go do something else I recently I've been streaming I just get run into issues and everything takes longer and I'm just very excited about everything and I've been going for like three three and a half four hours I don't think that's really good for anybody so I'm going to try to finish up by 4 o' today if I can which gives me a couple hours now um and um what um what I want to do is talk about something called convolutional neural networks why am I doing this this is not the coding train is not a machine learning AI Channel you might think that it is given how much time I'm spending on it but and I think that's probably because it's these days if you want to have computational literacy if you want to learn to code and participate in the world of software and data and creative coding you can't escape machine learning as a part of that discussion so it's important for me to focus some time and energy on it but I do want to also make sure the channel continues to have very beginner friendly content just you know fun generative algorithms and other kinds of things but I did teach a course at NYU um um this past fall it ended in December called introduction to machine learning for the Arts and my goal this fall was to create video tutorials for everything that's in this course and so if I look at it I have video tutorials for I have kind of like an intro I have video tutorials for image classification and transfer learning um some video tutorials for pretrained models and physical interaction like poset um I don't really have H yeah so data collection and model training this is the stuff that I've been doing more recently um with using the example of capturing pose data and so I would say that I'm pretty well covered up to week five in terms of the video materials for the course but I have almost next to nothing I do have videos on sketch RNN so that's good um but I have almost next to nothing on 6789 9 10 uh these 6 through 10 so I'm cutting myself off Janu the week of January 27th pretty much um this that last week is the first week of the NYU semester where I will be teaching my course um uh nature of code um which is uh built around this uh book so I I do have video tutorials for this whole thing but they're made years ago and they're not in JavaScript so this is the I'm going to reboot all of these gonna make video tutorials for all of this stuff and I'm starting that the week of January 27th but I want to see how much I can finish off and catch up on that I missed last semester between now during my winter break um so uh I think today I am going to attempt to talk about convolutional neural networks how do you feel about that let me know with an emoji in the chat Circle send chat no message what do you think about convolutional neural networks send all right that didn't work I don't know why it didn't work whatever um oh did I miss mentioned this new sticker there's another new sticker okay so so how am I going to approach this let's go to this page where I have some notes and links so here's a good starting point for me okay people thank you for these weird emojis in the chat love it um so I want to do so I'm getting there I'm building up the confidence for this ml5 gs. org I'm just opening up URLs that are going to help me uh reference neural network okay I need this page I need no I don't need this page I need this page I need a whiteboard marker oh hi I like to torture Myself by having a bin of whiteboard markers on the floor right there about which maybe like 60% of them don't work You' think I would just go pick one before I start and make sure it works yep now I should make a new bin that is maybe that is the garbage bin and I just don't know two more nope I'm not putting them back in that pin one oh this one's green H that's not going to do me any good it's not uh oh wait there's a green one with a cap on it that's the wrong color mystery solved oh wait I think the good whiteboard markers are actually over there oh this one's just fine okay how's the focus on that oh I'm so glad people in the chat are asking asking things like what is convolution because it's giving me a boost of a reason why uh to do this aha oh I know what I know how to begin this Oh wrong I know how to begin this ah aha aha okay all right all right we're going to do something cool H got it I got it I got it everybody question is am I going to build this example yes yeah let me just take a look let me just see where it is um wait I was already there low rest pixels this is what I want all right I'm gonna uh yeah I'm gonna make this example shoot so now I'm confused um yes Simon is asking me that Simon says I thought you would do this in vanilla tensorflow.js I don't know if I would use word vanilla with tensorflow.js um but uh yes but no that would make sense I right now I'm trying to move on to emphasizing uh ml5 and you know there's certain points in time where I would want to go dig into tensorflow.js but we've actually added a convolution network feature to ml5 so I think that's where I'm going to focus um let's make this a coding challenge uh let's make this a coding Challenge and oh I should really I should really decide in advance what I'm doing all right here let me just let me talk to you through my thought process here what I want to do is show you how you can use ml5 neural network to um how you can use ml5 neural network to train a model on image data and that's what this example is doing but it is using a plain vanilla neural network uh with no convolutional layers which uh bring which isn't as accurate or as um sorry I'm thinking about this um which has some pitfalls and so reasons why it doesn't work so well and convolutional neural networks have a mechanism a kind of layer a convolutional layer which I would like to describe and go through and then show how to implement an ml5 um which helps um increase the benefits and accuracy uh of uh increase the increase the B the accuracy I can I can I take a break now all right let's let's do this let's do some coding log in I I got it I just have to stop worrying and just um go for it so let me just see here uh file duplicate um and let's do sorry everybody okay hold on a sec um I'm just setting myself up with a basic template uh let me not let me not worry about that right now thinking about this okay all right everyone uh all right so this is good all right we're going to knock this out okay I'm I'm like off today for some reason I mean I'm I'm always off but I'm like a little off where I am off but I'm gonna get it back okay all right let me if you will please bear with me I just want to check to make sure my recording to disk system is working okay W that's really loud okay all right I think everything's good all right okay oh it spills a little bit all right all right I've got it hi Susanna first time watching welcome um okay and you thought we were done with the ml5 neural network tutorials but no there is one more because I am leading to something I am going to you will soon see in this playlist a section on convolutional neural networks but before I get to convolutional neural networks I want to look at reasons why a convolutional layer I I have to answer this question like what is a convolution I've got to get to that but before I get to that I want to just see why they exist in the first place so I want to start with another scenario for training your own neural network yeah that scenario is an image classifier okay hold on I see where I'm going I see where I'm going with this The Narrative it all fits together that scenario is an image classifier now aha no more starting over people is this camera like it's like to the it's like sideways again isn't it does that always seem to happen that's better right good enough that scenario is an image classifier now you might rightfully be sitting there saying to yourself you've done videos on image classifiers before and in fact I have the very beginning of this whole series was about using a pretrained model for an image classifier and guess what that pre trade model had convolutional layers in it so I want to now take the time to unpack what that means more and look at how you could train your own convolutional neural network again first though let's just think about how we would make an image classifier with what we have so far I don't know I think that like I'm think I might be overdoing the speeding up stuff which I like it when I need to draw big diagram but me just like pausing speeding up talking I think maybe the let's go with a little bit more of a natural flow we're starting with an image oh wait no I did it again but there's no way to like how did I used to do this before I used to have the speed up and post I just forget about it I'm just going to forget that post exists and that I'm just here with you in real time it's you and me talking about an image classifier we have an image oh no I want to draw a cat oh you're watching a crazy person on the internet today we have an image and that image is being sent into an ml5 neural network and out of that neural network comes either a classification or regression and in fact we could do an image regression and I would love to do that but let me start with a classifier because I think it's a little simpler to think about and consider so maybe it comes out with one of two things either a cat or a dog and some type of confidence score we've talked about how a neural network is in my previous videos I just what am I saying here I previously looked at I previously zoomed in on the ml5 neural network and looked at what's inside right we have this hidden layer with some number of units and an output layer which in this case would have just two if there's two classes everything is connected whoops everything is connected no what am I doing yes and then there also um and then there are the inputs with postet you might recall there were 34 inputs because there were 17 points on my body each with an XY position what are these well let's say this image is 640 by 480 yikes let's use smaller numbers let's just say for the sake of argument that this image is 10 by 10 pixels so I could consider every single Pixel to be an individual input into this ml5 neural network but each pixel has three channels and r g and B so that would make 100 times three inputs 300 inputs that's reasonable so this is actually what I want to implement take the core idea of a two layer Network um take the idea of a twolayer neural network to perform classification the same thing we've I've done in previous videos but this time use as the input the actual raw pixels can we get meaningful results from just doing that after we do that I want to return back to here and talk about why this is inadequate or not necessarily inadequate but why how this can be improved on by adding another layer so this layer won't sorry the inputs will still be there we're always going to have the inputs the hidden layer will still be there and the output layer will still be there but I want to insert right in here something called a convolutional layer and I want to do a convolutional a twodimensional convolutional layer so I will come back you want to just skip to that next video if and when it exists that's where I will start talking about that but let's just get this working as a frame of reference um all right folks how am I doing here 28 by 28 I know I should have done 28 by 28 Simon's always right always listen to Simon as what I say remember to duplicate before starting so people can start from the same place thank you Violet what good advice uh so this is going to be template and then let me do duplicate all right this is exciting stuff people I mean I could I just think this is not Germain is that the word I want to use this is not Germain to the topic at hand so if people want to learn about the pixel stuff I'll refer them to a separate video um and I gotta take a little sponsorship break in a moment I think this now is actually probably a good time for me to do that let's see if I can get I actually let me do this and then I'll take a break after after this before talking about convolutional n networks because I think I can get through this actually sort of quickly all right um okay what I have here now is some starter code starter code oh sorry I'm like remembering a thing on the internet from a couple weeks ago just have to cough I'm going to mute my microphone wait hold on let me make this a little bit bigger I'm going to start with some prewritten code all this does it's a simple p 5js sketch that opens a connection to the webcam resizes it to 10x1 pixels and then draws a rectangle on in the canvas for each and every pixel so this could be unfamiliar to you how do you look at an image in JavaScript in P5 and address every single Pixel individually if that's unfamiliar to you I would refer to my video on that topic that's appearing over next to me right now and you could go take a look at that and then come back here but really this is just looking at every X and Y position getting the RGB values filling a rectangle and drawing it so what I want to do next is think about how do I configure this ml5 neural network which expects that 10x10 image as its input I'm going to make a variable called pixel brain and pixel brain will be a new new ml5 neural network I should have mentioned that uh you can find the link to the code that I'm starting with in case you wanted to code along with me the both the finished code and the code I'm starting with will be in this video's description so to create a neural network I call the neural network function and give it a set of options one thing I should mention is while in all the videos I've done so far I've said that you need to specify the number of inputs and the number of outputs to configure your neural network the truth is ml5 is set up to infer the total number of inputs and outputs based on the data you're training it with but to be really explicit about things and and and make the tutorial as clear as possible I'm going to write those into the options so how many inputs they about that for a second the number of columns times the number of the rows times RGB maybe I would have a grayscale image maybe I could just make it I don't need a separate input for RG andb but let's do that why not and I have the the 10 by1 in a variable called video size so let's make that video size times video size time three let's just make a really simple classifier that's like I'm here or not here so I'm going to make that two the task is classification and I want to see debugging when I train the model so now I have my pixel brain my neural network just thinking about this I I think I'm gonna take these out three not two three not two oh times three thank you there oops that should be three thank you all right um now I'm GNA go with my usual terrible interface by that I mean key presses this is so silly what what do I want to do here I could have made buttons no let's make buttons let's have today be a day of slightly better interfaces instead of key presses let me put a couple buttons in the um on the page uh no no uh let's just go with let's just go with with key presses let go back to key presses let's go with my usual typical terrible interface meaning no interface and I'm just going to train the model based on when I press keys on the keyboard so I'll add a key press function and then I'm going to do something a little goofy here which I'm just going to say um when I press the key add example key so I need a new function called add example label so basically I'm going to make the key that I press the label so I'm going to press a bunch of keys for when I'm standing in front of the camera and then press a different key when I'm not standing in front of the camera now comes the harder work sorry losing my track of things now comes the harder work I need to figure out how to make an array of inputs out of all of the pixels luckily for me this is something that I have done before and in fact I actually have some code that I could pull from right in here which is looking at how to go through all the pixels to draw them but here's the thing I am going to do something to flatten the data I am not going to keep the data in its original columns and rows orientation I'm going to take the pixels and flatten them out into one single array guess what this is actually the problem that convolutional neural networks will address it's bad to flatten the data because its spatial Arrangement is Meaningful so I'll start by creating an empty array called inputs then I'll Loop through all of the pixels and to be safe I should probably say video. load pixels the pixels may already be loaded because I'm doing that for down here and I could do something where if I'm drawing them I might as well like create the data here but I'm going to be redundant about it and and I'm going to say um ah but this is this here's the weird thing I thought I wasn't going to talk about the pixel array in this video I'm just refer you to the previous one but I can't escape it right now for every single Pixel in an image in p5js there are four spots in the array a red value a green value a blue value and an alpha value Alpha value for transparency the alpha value I can ignore because it's going to be 255 for everything all there's no transparency if I wanted to learn transparency I could make that an input and have 10 by 10 Time 4 but I don't need to do that here so in other words pixel zero starts here and pixel one starts at so this is the the first pixel starts at index zero 0o one two three and the second pixel starts at index 4 so as I'm iterating over the all of the pixels I want to move through the array four spaces at a time there's a variety of ways I could approach this but that's going to make things easiest for me so that means so that means right over here this should be plus equals 4 then I can say the red value is video. pixels index I the green value the blue value the sorry the green value is at I + one and the blue value is at I + two and just to be consistent I'm going to just put a plus zero in there so everything lines up nicely so that's the r g and B values how does the push just want to see something I'm curious about how push works so if I have an array oops not int can I do this oh I can I can push three things at once into the array perfect then I want those RG and B values for this particular pixel to go in the inputs array I really really want to fix something in the web editor which is when you autof format it doesn't scroll all the way back up to the Top If somebody could like make that happen for me my whole life would change um yeah I could use Phil I could probably use a higher order function you're all right about that oh yeah because it's already oh I'm so silly I'm so silly why am I doing it this way the chat is making a very good point which is that I have all the stuff in an array already and all I'm really doing is like making a slightly smaller array like removing every fourth uh element I could probably do that with like the filter function or some kind of higher order function or maybe just use the original array so I not really sure why I'm doing it this way but I'm trying to emphasize the sort of data preparation step so I I I look forward to hearing your comments about and maybe reimplementations of this that just use the pixel array directly but I'm going to keep it this way for right now so I'm taking the r g and B and putting them all into my new array then the target is just the label a single label in an array and I can now add this as training data pixel brain add data inputs Target let's just make sure this doesn't give me any errors if I press the key no errors I guess that's good um let me train the model should probably make sure this is actually doing something skip that mat you edit that thing out let's say let's console log something just to see that this is working so I'm going to console log the uh inputs um and let's also console log the Target just to see that something's coming out so a whoops yeah we can see there's an array there and there's the A and now if I do B I'm getting a different array uh with B there so I'm going to assume this is working I could say inputs. length to make sure that that's the the right idea yeah it's got 300 things in it okay now one thing that I have emphasized is that it's hold on next step is to train the model so I'm going to say if the key pressed is T don't add an example but but rather train the model and uh let's give it train it over 50 Epoch and have a call back when it's finished training let's also um let's also add an option to save the data just in case I kind of want to like stop and start a bunch of times and not not collect the data again all right and I'm ready to go except I missed something important I have emphasized before that when working with neural networks it's important to normalize your data to take the data that you're using as inputs or outputs look at its range and standardize it to some specific range typically between zero and one or maybe between negative one and one and it is true that ml5 will do this for you I could just call normalized data but this is a nice opportunity to show that I can just do the normalization myself for example I know this is another reason to make a separate array sort of um I know that the range of Any Given pixel color is between zero and 255 so let me take the opportunity to just um divide every RGB value by 255 to squash it to normalize it between zero and one all right let's see how this goes oh yeah let's just see how this goes so H oh so H for here I am bunch of examples and N for not here what an interface and now t for train zon zoinks what did I miss just adding the normalize data function in whoops you know I really should put something in that's console login oh wait no that's me being here whatever it's backwards but I don't care right now I'm just trying to test it out okay so that's working now because I added this in but I don't want to do that what am I missing it really should work without calling normalized data and I think I need to investigate why uh yeah so what's going on here because I've really tested it not requiring normalized data in fact the example I thought doesn't use it l rest pixels right I'm doing the same exact thing here I don't call normalized data let's look at this earn this example is it because it's not doing classification no oh it's not working without calling normalized data hold on this is a bug have an idea I think there's a function called uh hold on you're going to get to the bottom of this everybody Source uh neural network um let's look here this is the release oh has this not been do I need the develop maybe I need the newer version has this fixed hold on a sec let's go to release no I'm in development so never mind I'm in development I thought there's like it checks to see I remember something where it checks to see if the data has been normalized let's see a normalize oh let's look in um here this like warmup thing so confused I should give up on this inputs outputs nobody in the chat is giving me the answer to this debug this if issue well I guess I should just go back to I guess I should just go back to um oh wait a second this is what I'm looking for is normaliz so there's some things that happen Beyond just normalizing the data here this data normalize data data raw prepare for training so can I call just want to like see if I can like kind of hack a little fix to this right now prepare for training is that what I do is normalized equals false says Sam I think it needs to do some other stuff um okay hold on let me go back to let me go back to my example just quickly see pick prepare for training is not a function this what's this let's have a look at pixel brain all right taking a look data config meta data is in there ready so Simon asked me why don't I just go back to normalized data because I mean so that would make sense if I wanted to be most efficient about my time but I really want to know it's bothered me every single time that it doesn't work um I don't think it's as simple as just setting is normalized equal to True hold on I have a I have a bit of a um a way of sort of asking this question hold on what I don't understand is this is clearly a function well maybe Simon is right and I should debug this later neural networks's meta is normalized all right let's try hold on one data raw prepare for training data raw yeah this is what I want to do prepare for training data raw but what why is that not a function neural network I make a new DIY neural network is this because I'm in in in release it's not a function prepare for training oh oh oh I do need to use the built version from development hold on on everybody hold on a there's still there's like 300 people here I don't know why that's the case hold on oh why did that happen uh oh oh right I forgot there's a whole new built version hold on let me just try this uh I'm G to just build the library from that Branch development for a second while that's happening let me know I lost like in the last five seconds I lost like 15 viewers uh this is going to take a minute to build so while that's happening let me talk to you about a wrong wrong button let me talk to you about today's sponsor of the coding train uh friends over at brilliant.org if you here's the thing sometimes when you're coding you get totally stuck and you absolutely the smartest thing you can possibly do is take a break and go take a walk rest call a friend call your mom I don't know something uh I don't you know one thing you could do is like go do a puzzle now maybe if you're coding your break shouldn't be a puzzle but often from something else I'm doing my break is a puzzle and brilliant.org is a lot more than just puzzles but um uh brilliant.org is an interactive website for lifelong Learners looks like my library has built um and it's something that I really enjoy and take a a lot of inspiration from so brilliant.org actually has a whole bunch of new courses on their website one of which is called algorithm fundamentals and they're completely interactive so a totally different way of learning from just like watching me Babble on and mess around and get stuck all the time is something like Brilliance and you can see right here being demonstrated this algorithm uh a contact searching algorithm and then you can actually play around and interactively move stuff and change stuff this is just you know like it's basically like working with pseudo code to develop an algorithm uh to learn about an algorithm um so um this new course has bigo notation conditionals Loops arrays all of these uh fundamentals programming there Dragon drop exercises it's the Bedrock of any education in computer science um and and usually you're stuck with like sort of like fighting with all this like syntax and so this is a really nice way of learning these con conepts interactively um in a really fun way there also is the um CS fundamentals course um which I can show you a little bit of here um so in terms of again this is all interactive of writing programs and how fundamentals and computer science Works um that's something that you would absolutely take uh take a look at you know it's January I'm a little bit late for this but you know you might have a a New Year's resolution to learn something new this year to learn something every day uh to try out an algorithm every day uh prove yourself a little bit every day and so something like brilliant is a great way of doing that um let me come back over here one of the things I like to do is look at what the daily challenges are um and so um there's two of them today Simon was telling me there was a a recent let me get the chat back up here for me um Simon was telling me that there was a um a recent um daily challenge that was related to something I did and maybe Simon you can remind me of what that was but um I this let's see am I logged in yeah I'm logged in under my premium account let's go do this one I love these kind of puzzles so I I um so this is a grid fill puzzle it's like similar to sodoku and you place numbers and squares in a certain way but certain way and so the idea here is that they have to add up so I can't this is showing me how I'd step through the solution to figure it out so let's go try let's together try this puzzle this will be fun okay oh it's actually asking me how many solutions does this puzzle have well let's just see if we can get a solution maybe it's zero zoom in here all right so the way that I do sidoku at least is I always look for something where a certain number has to be in a certain spot so if I have two ones two twos two three three threes let's let's look at I think gr gray means uh nothing could go there so that's like a zero so why did I interrupt the ml5 sorry Suzanne I'll be getting back to it uh just thanking brilliant who is just the sponsor a series of Simon tiger series of two challenges balanced Perfection that's the one I should go back and look at okay so it looks like here to get to nine if I have a two I mean one of these has to be a four one of these has to be a four one has to be a three right that's the only way I can get to nine so uh that one could be a four either could be a four let's try one of them either one of these could be a four what if I do it here there will cause an issue if I put it here because then this has to be a three and then that one has to be a two and that still works there's no like that's not not working um and here you know these could be two twos a three and a one so to me it feels like I could this is not a definite like either one this one well if this is a four this one has to be a u a one to be seven and this one has to be a three let's just see if this solution plays out then over here ah then this has to be a four so this could cause a problem or maybe it's right then this has to be nope nope though this won't work to put a four there because up at the top that one has to be a four to get six but I've already got six and I don't have a zero so great so now we know by process of elimination that this one has to be a four so then this one has to be a three then this has to be a two then this has to be a three I'm having stop talking to me then this has to be a one okay now what so to get I have one two three and four left to get to seven a four and a one or a three and a two and to get to six the same thing a four and a one or a three and a two I think oh and then same thing across does diagonal have to do anything no so I think there's going to be two solutions here right so let's just try one let's put a a four here which means this has to be a one and then a three here is that eight and then this one has to be a two that's one solution now let's just switch them can the four go here and the two go here the one go here and the three go here all right two is did I miss a third solution is there a third solution let's try two I want to make a in P5 a puzzle generator like this a sidoku puzzle generator all right one day streak okay um all right so um if you are interested in uh brilliant hold on a sec here I am gonna take a short intermission I just need to check something oh weird um my I was checking my in intermission animation which seems seems to be not working but I'm not going to worry about that um let me turn this off um um you can sign up for free at brilliant.org coding train um all of the daily challenges at least the one that is active that day are available for free and there's lots of other free content and then if you're interested if you like it you can consider signing up for the premium subscription and if you do that through that link you'll get uh the first 200 people we'll do so we'll get a 20% off discount and they'll know that the coding train sent you let's just see if this works no that does work I don't know why that didn't work so take a take a minute to sign up I'll be back I'm gonna get some water and I'll be back in about five minutes to finish off the convolution thing e all right coming back in just a minute or two got the mic on I think you can hear me okay going to take a slightly shorter break uh just to get a move on here with this I've really got to figure this out because it's it's making me crazy okay so what did I do I built the library and it should be here under dist this should be the one that I just built uh just now today 34 p.m. so let's manually add the library to this project let's stop here um let's do this and um let's see what happens oh then let's change it to the local version of the library I forgot that I had this horrible issue and I should just normalize the data with the function but I'm stubborn and I have uh this here okay let's see here here all right didn't say oh prepare for training is not a function am I losing my mind uh do I have to add some examples first pair for training is not a function all right I'm gonna have to just go back to normalize data I cannot solve this right now weird actually you know what I can by golly I can you're I'm sorry everyone but I'm gonna be really stubborn about this because this is the time for me to look at this the future of ml5 is at stake here not getting to convolutional neural networks am I um okay let me go to actually what is the latest Branch um with the neural network work oh maybe that was there's no active Branch so yes so it's it is development um so something that I can do is I can do so if I'm in the library I can do npm start run and what that's going to do is actually host a local version of the library right here at localhost 880 ml5 JS so here's the built version of the library and I can copy this and in the sketch that I'm working on I can let's get rid of this well yeah I can go into index.html and it should I should be able to load that version of the library that I'm working with locally so now ml5 is not defined I've gotten this to work before there it is that shouldn't do it that won't do it I can't get this to work all right let's take we're going to take some Extreme Measures here um and we're going to download this sketch oh seriously um and now why F the compile okay um what is going on here um gonna go to all right uh open up this sketch and visual studio code take a a look at it whoops thought I was being so clever by putting the dock to the right okay so let's look at this going to build the local version of the library okay then I'm going to run over here I'm going to run a server oh really that's weird what's going on with my setup here okay I'm running the server yes okay something is happen happening we're going to solve this we're going to solve this okay where okay what I've got going on right now is I have built a local version of the library at Local Host 880 ml5 JS then I have also my sketch running here I have the code for my sketch in Visual Studio code and it is referencing oh okay it is not it should reference this version of the library see what I get now okay great so just to be really really really sure that I'm actually working with my own built version of the library that I can edit I'm going to go back to the library and I'm going to go to the neural network Constructor oh uh oh so wait why is there some of like a DIY why was it called DIY somewhere it's weird um I was think it called DIY I think something's changed but I'm going to go to this sorry for all the scrolling um I'm going to go to index HS here and I'm going to just say console log Cho Choo so now I am and now if I go back to terminal it's re it should have rebuilt the library with that new console log and there we go choot choot so my changes to the library are taking effect now what I actually want to do I just realized is I don't want to go through I don't want to deal with having to collect the data constantly well let me just let's go through the motions here for a second I'm collecting some data oh I'm in such a better place for debugging now prepare for training is not a function fine fine I believe you there is no prepare for training function it's not here it was because I'm in oh wait let's get the latest G to get rid of my changes so I I'm not synced with the latest that's on okay now I'm synced should have rebuilt the library it rebuilt the library let me put my cho cho back in there ah see again I knew it was called something different DIY neural network oh boy compiled successfully Choo Cho collect some data call train aha it didn't tell me that the prepare thing was an issue all right let's go now to back to my example and let's try what I'm going to do is as soon as the video is ready let's do something very very silly which is just add example add example add example um I wanted to like add some data real quick hold that set time out add um add example a so like do that 100 milliseconds from now let's add just like two examples and then let's do a b so I I really don't care that the data is meaningless and then um half then at 500 milliseconds half a second later let's call train so pixel brain train finish training so I just want to do something to test this idea out that um um oh quickly add some data this is like a little quick sequence like add some data and then call train and see what happens without okay weird oh wait wait wait wait wait let's take out the key pressed sketch line 50 weird what is going on oh you know wait yeah sorry I think I have uh hold on it was caching disable cach I don't know why this computer it's like okay all right so it's doing something maybe it actually works this is weird has it been working all along and I just have the wrong version of the library um let's take this out and let's go back to my method okay we're going to add some examples of me being here oops what's in the ad example console log let's get rid of this yeah that's fine I'm here I'm here I'm here what sketch 37 get rid of this I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm here I'm not here I'm not here I'm not here I'm not here I'm not here I'm not here I'm not here now let me train the model oh whoa huh well that's W weird that it's like working now so what's changed so let me be more thoughtful about actually collecting some but I was say like what better data could I possibly collect let me cor collect very ridiculously 100 samples and then let me do 100 of not here and then boy but welcome to what programming is because like it wasn't working and then I downloaded locally and rebuilt everything thinking I'm using the exact same thing and it is working so clearly there's some mismatch somewhere which I haven't discovered yet this is what coding is uh oh is there a save data okay so I saved that data I don't need to collect it again let me try training yeah oh thank you Marcos for the happy New Year message all right so this is totally working what without I don't have do I have normalized data in there and I'm like going crazy no no no all right this is insane all right I'm gonna take this all this code let me call load let me just try loading the data how big is this file 1.4 megabytes uh shiftman do Json let's just call it data and then let me just soon as it's loaded let me call train so now I'm just seeing like well can I get this result again with no normalizing yes all right so now we're going back to the web editor and we're going to duplicate everything and take all this code and paste it in then I'm going to go here take this which is exactly the same and paste it in and try running it in the web editor does it work ml5 is not defined why is the web editor not able to load from Local Host I could have sworn I've done this before that's weird why does this not work in the web editor I could have sworn I have done this before anybody know weird all right so let's go back to here and do npm what let's try building the library going to get rid of this disc folder npm run build I don't think that I need my Global IP address I'm not I don't I should I've been able to access local things before cores I guess I need to have cores in I guess cores isn't enabled on the but I'm accessing it from a separate server yeah I'm using a different server for my example though a different port I don't really know why remember I said I was going to stop at 4 I gotta get back to my roots on this channel all this machine learning ml5 stuff is making me crazy come on build this Library okay so Simon is telling me to remove the Choo Cho no no I want the Choo Cho in there because I that is the one thing telling me it's actually the same version of the library I mean I do need to remove it eventually um so this this I just built this now so now if I go here and do add file bring this in here then I should be able to say okay good sign it doesn't have the data so now I can bring that data in okay okay okay all right I'm going a little crazy but that's okay where's my key pressed yeah okay so now Choo Cho oh wait no not here not here not here not here not here not here not here not here not here not here not here not here not here here here okay I don't know what was going on it's a mystery to me I just didn't have the most recent in development version of the ml5 library that has some bug fixes in it that clearly make this work and I just spent an hour discovering that there was nothing wrong with my code there was nothing there's no bug in the ml5 library I just was doing it wrong with the wrong Edition version thing bobber and you all eight of you that are left got to enjoy that yeah I should have kept the previous code to compare well yeah now I do want to get rid of the choo choo message just because that's gonna be confusing um so let me do that really quick let me do get stash then let me build it again oh boy I'm so sad that the title of this video says convolutional neural network Zachary MacArthur writes I really enjoyed watching this and that is very very nice of you to say even if it's not true I think it is true that that felt like a very genuine message but even if it wasn't true I appreciate the effort it took to write that um okay uh come on build build I want you just start the music arm me is watching from India and it's 210 a.m. thank you okay now one more try um we're going to get rid of this version of the library we are going to add file this version of the library okay if I could possibly if anyone could possibly remember where the hook cookie Kaka I was close out this stuff I'll leave this open I just minimize it I can close out this stuff so I think honestly I'm just back to where I was um dt6 why don't you start streaming a little earlier like the good old days I would I think next Friday I'll be streaming in the morning so next Friday where I will be continuing this because I'm clearly not getting to that much of it today I will be streaming in the morning all right nor Isaac I think is reminding me of where I was okay let's see if this works I'm going to collect it so I'm going to press this is a little bit silly but I'm going to press h for me being here in front of the camera oh whoops then I'm going to move off to the side and I'm going to use n for not being in front of the camera so I'm not here and I'm just GNA do a little bit right now and then I'm going to hit t for train and whoa loss function going crazy but eventually it gets down it's a very small amount of data that I gave it to train but we can see that I'm getting a low a low loss function if I had built in the inference stage to the code it would probably start to guess Dan or no Dan so let's add that in so once it's finished training let's add a function called predict or classify say classify video and to be honest this is exactly what I've done this this is no different than everything in the previous video so I'm just going to type it out again or maybe I'll just copy paste it let's go to hold on oh but I have to get the inputs oh I I'll do it again yes sorry when I'm finished training then I'll start classifying the first thing I need to do if I'm going to classify the video is pack all of those pixels into an input array again then I can call classify on Pixel brain and add a function to receive the results thinking how I want to demonstrate this could draw it on the screen I could console log it I could make a paragraph element let's do something fun and have it say hi to me so I'm going to make this label a global variable with nothing in it and then I'll say label equals results label and then here in uh and after I draw the pixels let's just say Phil 255 text size after I draw the pixels let's write either right high or not WR high so just to see that this works let's make the label H to start and it says hi now let's not make it h and let's go through the whole process oh wait no I'm doing it wrong it's gonna say hi when I'm away ah let's go through the whole process of collecting the data again train the model and says hi no don't say hi anymore oh I forgot to uh I forgot to classify the video again after I get the results so it classified it only once and I want to then recursively continue after I get the results to classify the video again I actually oops let me just say just so we can finish this out I actually saved all the data I collected to a file called data. Json and now I can say pixel brain load data data. Json and when the data is loaded then I can train the model so now I've eliminated the need to collect the data every single time let's run the sketch it's going to train the model I don't really even need to see this and it gets to the end hi no hooray oh David Snider what did you miss oh so much so much you missed so much two things I'm really curious about is just to see how this works with objects I'm actually really curious to see how this works with objects so maybe I'm going to try this uh mug um I'm G to compare this to teachable machine I don't have I have a I have the ukulele I'm really curious to see how well this works with objects so and what is distinctive here I'm going to try this with this ukulele let's try three let's be bold and try three objects I'm going to try the ukulele this uh a Rubik's Cube and then also this coding train notebook uh which you can get online but I'm not advertising that here but let's just try let's try these three things I'm going to run the sketch again and I'm going to press U for ukulele can I yet how will this compare to a teachable machine image classifier this is just a vanilla neural network with one layer a 10 by1 pixels one hidden layer so that's a bunch of examples for ukulele the Rubik's Cube is small but so R for Rubik's Cube okay and then notebook n for Notebook because I want to have something to compare for the convolutional neural network that I'm eventually going to build all right now I'm going to save this data so let me I'm going to call it three objects uh yuk Rubik's Rubik what was that note so I'm going to upload this file UK rubic note let's get rid of this I'm going to upload this file UK rubic note uh to my sketch and I'm G to load that as the data and incidentally I need to change the number of outputs to three it's actually going to infer from the data so even if I make that mistake I think it's going to ignore it but I like to have that in there just as like it's my uh you know Comfort safety blanket thing um and then let's just draw on the let's just draw the label so and again I didn't bother to include a nothing category which I should have so model seems to be training no problem and so now it okay R for Rubik's that's good what else did I do ukulele youu for ukulele kind of working and do I get an N an N for Notebook now you can see how sensitive it is I think teachable machine would probably have had more of sort of flexible accuracy meaning it probably would have kept with notebook even as I moved this back but this really learned that I was like sort of filling the page with these blue pixels uh um so in the chat um uh is being suggested that you should add an element to the page so you can add your own data so right you could now build an app where somebody coming to this could train their own model by typing in their own labels and that's really what teachable machine does but I'm not really trying to create an image classifier here I'm just trying to demonstrate the sort of capabilities of ml5 with looking at just just raw pixel information as input to a neural network the next step is for me to go onto a new I really want to try a regression I'll fix this later four o'clock it's four o'clock people one example a day is pretty much what I'm what I'm uh getting to it would seem um just quickly try something I got to do this for my own sanity I'm G do pixel regression and um I just want to sort of like see this with the uh neural network this with this neural network regression example so what do I need I need uh all this stuff to do an oscillator and then I need um to um this I'm going to need for when I get the results um I want to create a slider so where do I where do I have add data add data frequency fre Target frequency okay okay got it so now what I want to do is do a oh I'm in the close post classifier cancel um let's create a slider and have it go from 200 to 800 and start at 440 and then uh let's do slider. input uh oops wave. frequency the slider. value so I just want to quickly uh see if I can get a slider to control the frequency do I need to say uh wave. playay or something start oh I don't want an envelope it's much simpler okay now I need to also make sure you're hearing this uh so out put sound output multioutput device can you hear this is it overwhelming the volume is it too loud and then I'm going to do the thing where I I'm GNA do the thing where if I say d well keep s uh if I say d i I'm just getting pieces from all my previous examples pose deploy regression no uh data collection pose data collection regression I get this delay function Grandma here let just stick this in the bottom um and then uh oh no then I say uh let State equals uh waiting and I say uh State equals collecting await delay 10 seconds State equals awaiting and then in draw the target is now slider. value adding example slider. value um because it's a regression uh and that should be divided by 800 I'm going to like manually normalize here continue to manually normalize uh and then um I'm just going to call in draw if State equals collecting uh add example so let's see what do I say d okay so this is working it's adding examples and then if I hit T all right well I didn't move it's not going to learn anything because I all the examples had the same image so that's fine let's stop so when I train the model let's set wave amplitude to zero and then in got results do I have a got results function yet I need the got results function from here and what I'm doing I don't need to draw anything just want to set the frequency and also the slider or frequency value times 800 and then slider. value same thing so let res uh value equal results index z. value times 800 and let's say say value slider value okay here we go everybody uh should really invert it but whatever um this now what do I say d I don't know if 10 seconds was enough let's save that data Cas not not so promising oh is it too loud oh well somebody needs to tell me in the uh Discord sorry okay that's good to know uh hold on better sorry everybody I didn't know oh how do I is this okay try to make it a little quieter okay sorry everybody I need more than 10 seconds to collect the data let me just you know what I should let it normalize itself uh let me try let me try this again but I need more than 10 seconds to collect the data where's key pressed oh let me give myself like 30 seconds 30,000 milliseconds let's try that okay okay stopped save the data train why is it not learning yeah I know why why why why oh hold on a sec something is wrong something is wrong did I save that data right oh huge amount of data okay the X's are 300 pixels and the Y is just a number so this is right the data looks right so now I think the data is right so now I should be able to um do this and say pixel brain low data oh it's not going to let me upload a 12 megabyte file to the Ed let's download this which is good I'd much rather be in Visual Studio code right now trying to figure this out um ah why why why why um now put this in here going to load okay okay where's my got results all right let's see what happens here whoops so I'm not not getting a loss going down the posture is terrible all right good but I'm getting an error I like that okay sketch. JS line 66 oh weird entries oh oh it shouldn't be classify should be predict let's just train it for very few epochs right now to test get this going should say predict video where did I do the number repx let's just do like five value is zero what did I miss about training inputs task is regression why did this not work is my data bad I think my data is good I'm only getting zero out of the neural network so strange well let's try um let's try letting it normalize the data let's get rid of all my normalizing stuff and let's do this again um let's see what am I doing here let's take this out and ke pressed let's try this oh why am I not hearing the sound wait why am I hearing the sound now what did what did I miss I don't want to see These Warnings anymore how do I tell it not to give me the warnings font is too big I don't care um that's weird why am I not hearing the sound anymore where did I turn that off oh oh because of the like inter oh the interaction stuff I forgot about that okay sorry I forgot that Chrome will block starting sound okay so now I want to collect the data again save the data train the model huh remove outputs one I still have a divide by 255 left let's get rid of these oh let's got to give it more Epoch ah okay thank you all right I don't need to collect data for 20 seconds for 30 seconds let's do 15 oh I had 50 pck there okay okay save this data I wonder if it's just stuck at 800 just stuck at 800 I wonder if does it need all right let's look at let's try giving it um the video it's 30 let's give it50 let's give it many more hidden units and let me grab this data I collected um so this is pixel freak 2 wow it's so much less data now let's nothing 50 hidden units many more parameters oh I'm getting one out oh because I probably I'm really stuck well I should give up on this try quantizing the output to a musical scale yeah I could do the classification people are giving me some good suggestions but this should in theory work I'm worried that I'm the data is bad and I'm like there's a let's take a look at this uh this one these are all the pixel colors and then when I go to y 200 yeah 200 there should be wait a second wait a second no Y is 464 well I'm gonna upload this for people to take a look at I I gotta I gotta just give up on this right now let me clean this up a little bit by getting rid of some unnecessary files um let me get rid of the P5 Library I'm GNA let people take a look at this maybe somebody watching can like figure it out so what I need here is these three script Tags I'm sad today unsure about what I'm doing here and if any of this makes sense I don't know why none of my formatting stuff was working things seem to be wait how is this how am I having a loss of 300,000 what is going on something is wrong with my data I mean I should I could so weird 16 hidden units what is going on did I spell regression wrong I guess I could try Okay I I gotta put this aside I got to take my own advice here and um close this okay I'm going to just make a repo with this code and upload it okay so let me a lot of people joined late or most people have left which is what they should have done um but uh Chris has asked me can you restate the problem so I was working on a tutorial video about the capabilities of ml5 and I looked at how to build an image classifier just reading a um a low resolution oh whiteboard camera went off so we'll come back in a second a low resolution version of the image with 300 RGB values so 10 by10 image RGB for each one 300 inputs uh into two or three different categories classification worked so then I redid it but I wanted to do a regression where the output is a continuous value between 200 and 800 and I couldn't get it to work I'm not sure where I went wrong to be honest my guess is that I actually don't I mean I don't know it might I don't have a guess um so I did I miss normalize data ah did I actually forget to type in pixel brain normalized data that was the whole point of me redoing this so that I put that did I just forget to type that line of code in there oh if this works I'm gonna I don't know what poop my pants is that the appropriate reaction um weird also huh oh am I not like running the server anymore huh oh I renamed the folder so many things well first of all don't play the sound Lori wrote a very nice comment which is it makes you'll get it working at some point not getting something work is always frustrating but don't be too sad it's always nice to see you work thank you Lori for that nice comment I mean part of what I'm doing is to show you that this is what it is Dena is asking can I make a logarithmic frequency spectrum yes um take a look at the um P5 fft in the P5 Sound Library but that didn't seem to fix it what is going on I feel like something is going on where the target is not right okay I have to put this aside and look at this and come back to it but let me at least go here and uh um add that in here yeah that should let me just give me let me just collect the data one more time not just for the sake of argument no no I put it here yeah I put the normalized data in here yeah so Josie is asking about normalizing so yeah why Aon is saying why is it 300,000 I've never seen anything like that is there I I can't don't recall if there's an existing example of this I'm very stubborn and I have trouble putting things away which is often the best thing is do I just look at this later I'm sure I'll figure it out um let me go to uh examples low rest pixels all of these are not regression examples the only regression example is this simple one and then I made a pose regression example which totally worked so one thing that I really want to do with this and I should um hold on let's let's be a little bit more thoughtful here for a second is let's now clone this repo because I I want to just do a couple more things on this want to do a couple more things um let me close out some other stuff um oh I don't know if it actually no no I think it was right um just do this one more time let me just okay so now that's not going to work still running the other server I don't want to do okay so still not working but one thing I want to do that could present a problem is I have some really redundant code which is I make this input array over and over and over again so I really should change this to I should write a function let's just put it at the top called get inputs where uh I make an array and I return it right so every time I want to get the RGB value inputs I should just call get inputs so here that's going to be in a few different places inputs equals get inputs and then and this is drawing so I'm going to keep that and then the other place that I'm doing it is in predict right oh yeah so that's making things a little bit more consistent um and let's not load the model anymore h no oh but at least we're back with like a loss that's at 0. five but no matter what I do I just get two it just only predicts 200 is there a bug one possible bug let me try this let me forget about the frequency for a second just turn that off and then let me just use like a a normalized range for the output you I have this suspicion that maybe the pixels aren't going in correctly like am I like not reading yeah all right only zero I yeah well that didn't none of that that didn't that didn't change anything have to put this aside just pushing those changes up um there one I mean all right I we now see the problem do you have XY rotated in your pixel array yeah but I'm not I'm actually using the raw pixels I'm not even X Ying anything I'm I'm going to have to um put this aside let's just pretend that this let's just go back to uh where I was close out all this stuff I mean last few little things I could try just just for the sake of argument let's try okay I have some wait I have let's just try a couple little things I can't resist um where are all the options mean could a different loss function is that what I need or learning rate I think I'm gonna I'm GNA investigate this later take a break thank you I'm gonna I'm going to go back to this one this was where I started with it not working I'm open pick neural network was this the so Mata maybe this can be salvaged whenever you end up looking at this and we'll discuss it by um basically I'm just going to like do a little wrap up here with this and demonstrate this and eron is saying maybe the regression function is broken and that's what I'm thinking but I got it to work with the poset example I made so I don't think it is um um Muhammad is asking a great question which maybe I'll join the Discord and and I can uh help you out there but I can try to answer it is confusing but there is a playlist that's good for getting started um so let me do this I was also curious okay let's see so it worked there with knowing whether oh we can always put something else behind me so I was also curious to see whether it would work to recognize a few simple objects like this Rubik's Cube ukulele and coding train notebook so I quickly collected some data and just labeled them with u are you are an n and it does actually work you n and R so is this as robust and accurate as the version of Something object detect image classification that I did with the teachable Machines videos it's interesting to compare and contrast but here there's no prerain model I actually collected the data and trained this model with a plain vanilla ml5 neural network with just one hidden layer which is kind of amazing but the point of this again is for me to look at next what are the what what how can this be how can this be improved so I want to eventually look at what does it mean to add a convolutional layer in here what can be improved what does it mean to have a convolutional layer how do you add a convolutional layer in the ml5 library that's what I'm going to cover in the next video I also have been trying really hard but I haven't been able to get it to work to make a regression U maybe by the time I release the edited version of this video I'll have a working version of the regression which I will insert right here if it was there hooray if it wasn't look in this video's description eventually I'll get that to work where I can set a uh frequency of an oscillator so um to to uh um to how I move about try that let me do that part I was also trying to get very hard just now but it's not in this video um oh wait Isaac says I fixed it with learning rate hold on hold on everyone hold on everyone I was about to try the learning rate what did you make it what did you make it let's try 0 five 0.002 works oh it needs to like a was like a really really high learning rate the defaults for regression in ml5 are bad bad B default oh oh oh this is very exciting this is very exciting oh Isaac I send you like a join the Discord and message me I could send you a notebook or something thank you um I think the activations by default are sigmoid I don't remember what the uh whole holding horses sound can we finish on like a high note here um I can't believe I didn't think to try that um wait wait wait wait wait I want to put all the frequency stuff back I can't remember if I collected this data now not normalized or what I'm so confused wait a sec oh I did weird stuff to the slider let me try collecting the data again uh we learned today not to give up which is true um 0 800 400 just to start hold hold on I got to like re I got to collect the data again because I want everything to be consistent so let's make the slider go between 200 and 800 we'll start at 440 and I'm going to call normalize data when I train the model I'm going to call normalize data when I train the model and then in prediction when I predict when I get the results I can just use the value to set the frequency and the slider okay and I have all my options in key pressed where's key pressed to turn this off to save the data to collect the data for 15 seconds okay here we go oh whoops I have to start I have to also put back this so now I'm going to start collecting okay train the model let's save the data train the model working working working working working working working working working working working working working working y okay I'm like I don't even know what to do now okay all right oh my God I I I feel like I need to do all this again not really I don't mean like all of this again I have to pee so bad right now I also need to go home well it's five o'clock um my messages um okay okay all right so now we are like no what what's this yeah leave I don't I don't want this okay okay so there's this and then there's this one oops oh yeah okay okay okay now let me just train this one more time for okay just get the I'm gonna be done for to the day in a moment um now pixel regression okay and and let's see Jon hold on sorry I want this to do the right thing which is I'm just gonna change this to that's fine uh we'll make sure this works in the web editor okay awesome all right now right I'm going to go away in a moment that's kind of pathetic so I was gonna maybe draw that again there okay all right okay okay wait what I don't know what people are talking about in the chat now okay drunken science I did and you're about to see since I was able to get since I was able to get this image classifier very basic TW layer vanilla neural network image classifier at ml5 to work to know if I'm in front of the camera camera or not I thought let's just try it with a few different objects and see how well it works so I collected a whole bunch of data um no I collected a bunch of images of this ukulele this coding train notebook and um Rubik's Cube and I think you'll see that if I show it the must have moved the camera so sad Rubik's C it's all like off notebook let me not that trading the model again will do anything you know what I have a plenty of footage that we can put behind me of it working I don't have a base class I should have had one why is this the wrong like data file no whoa what is going on oh I wasn't standing in front of the camera gele all right let's TR let's I'm I'm a crazy person and I don't and I refuse to give up I'm G to give it a bunch of examples of this ukulele let's actually so I'm pleased that that worked um let's see how it performs I don't know how this is going to get edited but UL all right here we go I'm pleased that that works worked I probably shouldn't but I just want to try having three outputs so let's try something similar to what I did in my previous videos using teachable machine to train an image classifier and we'll look at this ukulele coding train notebook and a Rubik's Cube so let me collect a whole lot of data uh I'm going to press U for ukulele R for Rubik's Cube and N for Notebook oh the camera went out that hasn't happened in a while have to refocus it a pain in the neck I have to refocus it hold on save the data in case I need it later and train the model why didn't I remember to do a nothing all right so now uh ukulele you n for Notebook and can we get an R can we get an R can we get an R ah sorry I wasn't I stood to the side when I was doing the Rubik's Cube so that is pretty important so it's not working so well so that's not a surprise I don't expect it to work that well this is why I want to make another video that covers how to take this very simplistic approach and improve upon it by adding something called a convolutional layer so what is a convolution what are the elements of a convolutional layer how do I add one with the ml5 library that's what I'm going to start looking at in the next section of videos and we'll see does it work better but before I go I can't reg resist just trying one more thing so I actually just rewrote this example very quickly let me but before I go I can't resist just doing one more thing because I really want to look at and demonstrate to you what happens if you change from using in pixel input to perform a classification to a regression so I took code from my previous examples that just demonstrated how ml5 and regression works and I changed the task to regression I had to lower the learning rate thank you to the live chat who helped me figure this out after like over an hour of debugging I had to lower the learning rate to get this to work um and train the model to uh what did I do and train the model with training data of me in different positions with different uh wave frequencies for a and I train the model with me standing in different positions associated with a different frequency that P5 Sound Library liary played and you can see some examples of me training it over here and now I am going to run it and see if it works and that will be the end of this video so I had saved the data and now it's training the model and as soon as it finishes training you'll be able to hear all right so I will leave that to you um as an exercise I I'll obviously include the link to the code for this in the video's description on the web page on the coding train.com with this particular video I can come back and implement it you can go find the link to the live stream where I spent hour over an hour implementing it but um I'll leave that to you as an exercise C if now you follow this video and have image classification working can you change it to a regression and have it control something with continuous output okay if you made it this far thank you and I will be back and start to talk about convolutional neural networks what they mean in the next video all right this is the this is it everybody I've got to go I mean I'll be back next Friday for sure I can get back earlier because I I really want to build an auto encoder I'm very excited about this um which I don't know how I'm going to do um what did you use for Chrome dark mode asks David SNY oh I don't know to be honest I have no idea I have to look that up ask me in the Discord okay remind them to join the Discord server at the end you can join the Discord there's also a new coding train store which you can find at going to Standard TV standard. TV coding Trin um and there's some stuff here like this handy notebook that you can use for image classification uh so just wanted to point that out if you're interested you can check that out you know I'd also say there's this is part of standard. TV and there's a ton of other creators with uh really wonderful stuff uh here that you can also look at and I'm done I'm done can I answer a few more questions can you code it so that when the Sound reaches a certain note by the person moving to take a photo yeah so you could make a that's a great idea for a project you could do a classification oh oh oh um the name of the Discord server it's called coding train there's a link in this video's description and if somebody could paste it into the chat maybe but in the video's description there's a link to the Discord uh to the invite um Aon thanks for the thanks for the way uh option of the advice about using filter this is a great idea for a project maybe we can maybe we can include this we'll see someone uh who is this in the chat um well um a great idea just came up in the chat by the way that you could think about also as an exercise how would you make a photo booth when that recognizes something and then takes your picture of course you could have done that with the teachable machine stuff so I don't know how great that a suggestion is never mind that's a great idea we won't include that in the video but that is a great idea uh maybe I can manage to get the Discord Link in the chat let's see if I can solve this before the song ends I haven't been I haven't been cubing in quite a while I feel the pressure where's that other silly white piece oh my God I'm losing my mind I'm so ridiculous it's been so long since I worked on a Rubik's Cube now it'll go fast because I was just forgot what I was doing how much time do I have oh I have a minute 20 I'm going to be fine what am I doing here what am I doing here 46 seconds 46 seconds left oh there's more oh it's going to be cutting it really close I'm going to have to get lucky here I hate this cube is not a good one oh 14 seconds oh I can do it no I started to panic I started to panic I started to panic I started to panic let me just give me give me a second here everybody okay okay okay I'm gonna give myself 20 seconds again a little bit of time to spare thanks everybody for watching I will see you next week um is it possible to save an ml5 neural network as a Json uh this do that would actually be a good Fe I think yes I don't know if that's easily done in ml5 um thanks everybody for watching I'm going to go and it's going to be the weekend and this might get edited into something and I I got to come back and talk about the convolutional stuff and I guess that'll be next week sometime um thanks everybody actually I forgot I usually like to play at the end the songs with uh words in them just to come back for a second um Aon yeah I want to actually eventually start to use images from files and not the webcam so I will have to investigate that for is aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between Z and 10 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8 9 2 1 three I pick nine a lot apparently but with pearing noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six 5 4 five six 7 five six 7 five 6 S 8 8 seven six look this is like pear noise performance 9 2 1 I 2 four four five six 5 this is like PE noise performance but with
