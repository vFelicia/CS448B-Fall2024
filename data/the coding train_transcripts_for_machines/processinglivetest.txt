i don't want to be able to hear you i need to turn that on this has to go here hello okay can you hear me yes hold on let me fix this camera can you hear me i can yes that's very exciting this totally works and can you see what i'm uh doing here in the white on the whiteboard yes hello um uh now i'm getting a loop what do you mean you're getting a loop the stream is behind but that doesn't matter um okay i'm looking for a marker um i guess actually maybe no it's a terrible idea i was trying okay wait i lost my marker oh there they are there they are okay everything's gonna be okay now did you witness the loop that i heard no i didn't there was no loop that i could notice all those times where you answered whether or not you could hear me you didn't hear those no because i only said that once are you or do you have the stream open in addition to the hangout or only the hangout i don't know if there's anybody watching i can juggle that why do you think that shawna this is actually a processing juggling show these are very hard to juggle these uh they don't flip and they don't like softly land in your hand um you can also probably balance one on my nose they can't never mind i was doing good though okay uh this works are you where are you are you just in the hallway yeah i'm just in the hole you want me to you want me to go somewhere quieter well i think i can hear your speakers no not yours i feel like my speakers are going into your microphone maybe not i thought i heard a little feedback i just want to make sure it's not a proximity thing i don't um i don't uh yeah i don't know how i could be giving you no you're probably right okay so i what i want to do here is check and see if there's anybody um all right so i don't know i don't see any way on the youtube thing to tell how many people are watching or if there's any way to there's no chat there's a leave a comment the youtube thing is behind so it's confusing for me to look at that it is behind twitter okay okay if you're watching uh post a ques a question about processing on twitter oh wait i see no there is somebody left to comment ask a question is this visible that would be like that would be the thing the other thing is i don't know how you can't there's no i have to invite you to the hangout but this works i could just actually do uh i have to record a list of videos to make just make one of them it's kind of funny it would be live uh but there's no i mean i need i need a like a wall of uh screens with faces or something yeah let's see i don't i doubt there's anybody really watching this all right so maybe we should maybe we need to find somebody on the itp floor who wants to like join in and ask is like working on something you could ask a question to try you want me to go look around i'll look around sure okay in the meantime i will recite lyrics from my name is no i can't pronounce um or i wish i had like interesting strange tricks i could do but juggling is about it i don't have anything good to juggle let's see here somebody leave a comment somebody did leave a comment people are watching nobody working on any processing stuff are you guys worth any manner or form what's that right now yes yes do you want to ask dan shiffman any questions he's doing live uh office hours throughout this or this is we're talking we're trying things out yeah yeah is that a google hangout it is a google hangout yeah um so how do we get them into the hangout i would have to know so what i need is the gmail that i can invite to the hangout you need to know their their google id yeah that's correct oh hello wait we're in the conference room hello okay let's hang out see what i really need is what i need is a monitor right here that has a hangout on it so i could look at it and talk to it because right now what i'm doing is i see the hangout over here so i'm going to pretend i'm just i can basically only hear you i only have audio at the moment so you can ask your question it has to be audio do you want to use my computer yeah we could just yeah so let me just launch process whatever you know what what else is a problem dan what is that when you type and you're on a hangout it mutes your audio seriously yeah we are you able to hear us right now i can hear you yeah okay we can hear it okay are you able to see our screen uh if you do screen sharing and i walk over here i do have the hangout open so we can do this and he could see the processing sketch that's amazing so now you can see our processing sketch yeah right then you can see it yes i can can you scroll on oh oh just screenshot i see so it's whatever so if you wanted to ask him any processing questions like in this he could help out yeah so so in your experience like if you had some like if you run into difficulties you think it would be enough this would be enough or do you think he would need to be interacting with the sketch that would be you know good better if he can like if he could yeah dan show them what you can do here like what well here the thing is is i was imagining that maybe i might if i'm going to do one of these have people submit stuff in advance through dropbox so i would have sketch folders just ready to go over here that's so good do you like him like standing there and really we could look at that so you could um i mean i you know maybe you don't actually have anything but you you could like email something to me or stick it share dropbox with forget which account this is uh you can share to if you share anything via dropbox to videos and shiffman.net then i can get it instantly uh over here so yeah oh yeah i did i just hit the button share via dropbox this is great videos how long did they let you do these uh hangouts on here i think you can go forever forever forever and ever can i get a little chamber pot put over here and then exactly well actually we'll get you a feeding tube and a catheter very awkward okay so this is how you can share anybody watching all maybe one of you watching um you could tweet a question or share processing sketches to videos let's see let's see oh let's see what's happening on twitter uh richard gill says i don't have a question but i am watching hello and how many ways yeah how often let's see this is what i see this is very meta it's strange the when you have the screen sharing up it's a little disconcerting because it feels like nobody's there there we go there's me um how do i find the dropbox how do i find your dropbox videos so i have to go to the dropbox any other tweets dan let's see uh yes good question hi sean van every from um wichita kansas writes in and says is that even a place i don't know um oh yeah can you see me oh yeah says how often will you do this okay so this is just a test clearly we're completely disorganized i don't really know what we're doing but um my plan is starting in the fall starting in september we will do this at a specific time once per week uh or at least every other week um and that there will be a time by which you can submit questions so that maybe on an email box or something where you could submit questions in advance and then i will pick a few and we'll do like an hour an hour kind of thing where you know do like uh four questions 15 minutes each or something it'll be awesome it'll be music and dancing except without the music and dancing oh okay somebody else writes in ah okay look oh my goodness this is a very hard question okay i got a question is there a processing library for quad tree detection um not that i know um so um you know if you use so you might be wondering not the person who asked the question probably because they presumably know what quad tree collision detection is i i don't really but i have a big idea in my mind but essentially we you have this problem when you're working on a sketch that has lots of things in it let's say you have this sketch and it has lots of objects in it let's say each object has to check if it's colliding with another object and if you just have two of them each object you know object a has to check well hey that's a bad example let's say let's say you have three you have a b and c object a has to check against a b and c object b has to check against a b and c and object c has to check against a b and c okay so if you have three things this is one two three four five six seven eight nine three times three is nine this is an n squared algorithm meaning the number of elements that you have to do collision detection you need to need to do that number square so if you have three you've got to do nine so let's look at it this way by the way if you have zero if you have 10 you have to do 100. if you have 100 you have to do ten thousand if you have one thousand you have to do i'll do one million um one billion thank you for pretending to laugh but one person who's watching this this is great i'm watching okay so um there's three of us in here watching oh three excellent and possibly a four or five okay so if you notice we just went up by a factor of 10 but we're going up by a factor of a hund of of a hundred so we're we're getting these mass amounts this and this becomes incredibly incredibly slow this is the problem i forgot where once you have a lot of things on the screen to check if they're colliding becomes incredibly slow so there are all sorts of fancy ways of figuring out how you could say like oh we could divide the screen into cells and we could maybe have just these objects check against other objects in their cells that's called bin ladies spatial subdivision and in fact if you're looking for an example of that look no farther than chapter six i believe um so this in the nature of code which is natureofcode.com in chapter six uh i think uh in 6 15 i kind of go i kind of go through and describe at least how to do sorry i lost where this was huh oh here it is so i kind of walk through this example of how to do uh bin lad spatial subdivision in the context of a flocking example and i think that i have do i have on this machine it would be sad if i didn't i do all the nature of code examples i will just demonstrate this for you very briefly by the way we haven't talked anything about quad three but you know kind of on the way there maybe i'll you know i'm kind of avoiding that sounds like a very complicated topic that i would possibly understand so we'll mention that in a second um okay so i go to chapter six and the example i'm looking for is bin ladies spatial subdivision let me just run this example in processing very briefly so here is a sketch now on google hangout you probably can't really notice that the animation is very slow but you can see this over here frame rate 12 12 frames per second this is 2 000 objects each determining if they're touching another object they turn white if they're not they turn green it's only running at 12 frames per second very very slow that's with no bin lattice spatial subdivision with bin laden spatial subdivision subdivision which apparently i can't say we can see now that we're getting a nice frame rate of like 45 frames per second exactly the same but it's much faster so um uh what was i saying so you know i didn't actually go through the details of how bin ladies space tools subdivision works because i have no idea what i'm doing some weird live google hangout rambling thing but um but it's essentially an algorithm that just allows you to subdivide your window into different cells all of equal within height so there are fancier things like quadtree which allow you to be more what you know what if suddenly all of the in a flocking simulation all the voids are suddenly in the bottom right hand corner of the window you're going to have to do something more sophisticated to be able to get any type of optimal collision detection but the question was asked is there a library for quad 3 something around collision section but i'm pretty sure that box 2d which you can use in processing employs uh if not quadri something similar to optimize its collision detection because it's certainly not doing those um i i would i would almost be i'm almost certain that it's not doing a kind of raw brute force collision detection thing okay yeah is that raw brute force way that you described in the beginning the n squared one yes is that actually the brute force way or would you say is eight is a touching b and c oh i gotta i gotta run for a minute asking how do we get ending okay let's see we have some more uh maybe some more questions that are being asked on twitter oh no just somebody retweeted that this was happening hey dan i actually have to hop off okay okay bye bye guys i'm gonna um hang out here for a little bit longer if anybody wants to ask a question but how do we get into the hangout yeah so can you send can you tweet at dan your your google i guess you'd have to direct message me if you don't want it to be in public but i need to join hang out where twitter just dm him google you can also just email it to me or email him your group your google app email and then he'll invite you to hang out i guess i'll email me hello good how are you uh let's see here somebody shout let's see i heard somebody at the door uh okay let's see i think i'm getting a message i need another little podium here no no messages ah oh somebody sent a sketch okay um oh no i need it wasn't it was emailed to me so i got an email actually which with a sketch here but it wasn't sent via dropbox so i have to um uh let me see if i can get it let me see if i can pull it open i really don't want to log in oh the camera cut out hold on everybody hello okay so uh somebody sent me an email i'm gonna have to share it via dropbox myself because i uh i don't want to log into my email on a live stream but people send me lots of very private and touching beautiful messages that i know they wouldn't want to see it online okay um ship share dropbox sorry everyone i'll have this in a moment i don't know how what do you what do people like on the radio there's you're not ever supposed to have silence is this kind of like the radio dropbox share uh share this folder with uh videos at shiftmoon.net okay so this is coming in from this is coming in from from joel uh matthew i don't know maybe i'm not supposed to say people's names i don't know it's quick okay uh let's see if i can get this sketch now that was sent to me uh dropbox ah invited to share except hit accept right let's go to dropbox folder there it is here it is okay so let's look at this um so we've got a nice little sketch here i think the files are still coming in still downloading so we'll wait so let's look at the question um i test a ball the question says i'm reading i test the ball for collision the the text collision is 95 of the time but occasionally the ball falls right through so i'm not sure if it's a um voice it's really slow it's not in yet i'm not sure if this is a ball versus ball collision or a ball versus wall collision but i wonder we're gonna look at the sketch in a second but if you have a sketch where you have this ball and you're testing right if this is like the bottom of the screen height maybe you have an if statement where you say if y is greater than height maybe you're testing if the ball goes past this part then you're going to do something like hey maybe there's a variable called y speed which is telling us how the ball is moving down and you're saying y speed equals y speed times negative one this we're going to see if the code is actually related to this question but this is potentially a problem why is this a problem you know we don't really know different things could be happening you know you can seems like an exact science but uh we could have a situation where the ball goes past the height it turns around but it doesn't actually make it all the way back it turns around and just goes to here and then what's that problem it's still below height so this would still be true and it would tell it to go back down so you can often get these scenarios where something is stuck below the surface now there's nobody there's nobody to talk back to me because i don't know nobody's on the hangout right now but um but there's a nice solution to this which is what we could often do is just set y directly to height so that if the ball goes down in addition to setting it back we also sneak its location right back there so we kind of like nudge it back onto the screen but let's see let me try to go back to the sketch which is now downloaded um okay so one thing that's interesting about this is i'm getting ah here we go javascript intersect whoa okay so this is going to be a big so this is not we're going to run this and maybe we'll see that there's a problem but this is probably going to be much too this is a large sketch than about kind of having looked at it uh and there's already some other stuff going on audio stuff so i'm gonna i guess i'm gonna have to unfortunately speak more generally or less uh uh unless um whoever sent this in wants to try to ask a more specific question about the scenario but right now i don't want to uh because i could like sign off and debug and sign back on okay wait i got a message here uh no link you you just have to share with videos okay um now let's see what's happening on twitter thank you for doing this live stream it's quite interesting uh we will hang out with okay um so if you want to maybe i'm gonna check my email maybe somebody emailed me oh you can't see me right now hurry up maybe somebody emailed me to get invited to the hangout okay wait uh i've got somebody who maybe wants to join i'm going to try to invite them let's see if i can do this um i really don't like where this podium is but i have to work on this later okay invite invite interestingly enough unless you're the original creator of the hangout you cannot invite someone so let me see if you can invite yes hello all right we have somebody yeah that's me hi dan this is dave pentecost hi nice to see you virtually almost in person the other day but now virtually this is great uh running the screen behind you that's a nice trick thank you um okay so what's going on what's happening today in uh processing land uh well uh andres was around all weekend uh are actually saturday evening to uh what's that i think um you might have the stream open in a different window yeah i do hold on all right we have somebody it's kind of like in the old days when they said turn your radio down okay i've stopped it in another window can you can you see me or am i screwing things up here no no you're absolutely fine i actually can't see you but i can hear you i can't see you if i look over here so now i can see you okay i'm standing over here in this direction i don't see anyone okay well but now i don't see you on the oh right there we go yep so uh so andres was here can you hear me yeah yeah yeah so andres was here and um uh he struggled a bit with this uh with this hemispheric projection it turns out the fisheye that's in version two is not the right thing it's not the right fisheye for the dome uh he came to a conclusion that it's a lot more complicated than he expected and he started working with a different approach well we know that there's a 1.5 version somebody else came up with and that we can use with some of the samples including some of uh robert hodgins things we could try that with that but for the 2.0 stuff he's still struggling with your camera yeah camera goes off every 30 minutes okay um so let me know i don't know that anybody else is actually watching this but just um also because i have some questions just this might be just an interesting brief discussion that we can have so you uh have a uh planetarium dome so it's uh and is it just a single projector or what's the kind of a single computer what's the setup yeah okay so it's a single fisheye projector i wanted to wanted to make it as simple as possible for anybody like you or andres or anybody any other visualizers to come in and uh plug in and immediately put things up there but the coolest thing of course would be if we can frame any of the processing sketches with a fisheye view so it uh it looks in perspective we can have things floating around us in the dawn right so if you just took a regular processing sketch put it through the projector and projected it would look distorted is that what's happening without right if if it's um yeah you see a distorted rectangle depending on the size of uh of the sketch you'll see a distorted rectangle we can do that we can throw it up there right um and but if it's in a circle that's 1200 by 1200 pixels 1200 diameter then it can fill the dome if it's a radial sketch it might look cool in the dome but if it's a 3d sketch we've got to impose this this hemispheric projection on it for it to look in perspective so it ideally should be a circular and 1200 pixels in diameter right our our projector actually is uh goes up to 1600 pixels but right now we have the windows computer that's running the astronomy software in uh dueling dvi at 1600 and i'm in an hdmi input which only goes up to 1200. so 1200 is pretty i mean the 1200 is manageable for computing purposes and it's pretty simple anybody can come in and plug in i wonder if even just using something like mad mapper would somehow have like a it could take like a little simple 3d model of the dough and then uh the process well the problem is yeah the problem is you really have to simulate a 180 degree fisheye lens right so you need to create you need to do it with a uh you know one of these cubic projections that are actually like having a bunch of cameras that you then shoot the results from and project up there interesting well the good news is if there's anybody well suited to figure this out his name is andres yeah that's what i thought too but he was pretty stumped last night he left a little dejected but he's determined um so i look forward to having a chance to come look at it too right yeah it's it's pretty fun as i say you know almost anything projected up in the dome looks cool it's coolest if it if it's up there in proper perspective if you're a stickler about that right uh and also since you're going to be doing these this unit with your students about projecting space which looks very cool um this you know i i mean projecting space on a flat screen that's how we look at everything everywhere else besides the planetarium but they might find it uh interesting to see it actually surrounding them so yeah it would be perfect i mean my kind of idea would be to have some basic examples that show how to make a sketch that would run there and let the students play with it and then actually go over and try them out right it's gonna be once uh andres has the the uh the bugs worked out on this it's gonna be a pretty simple matter to drop your sketch into a draw scene uh area in his fisheye met up right awesome so that'll be that'll be fun and i think you'll find it interesting i want to i want to connect you as i i said in the email i think i want to connect you with uh carter emmerd who has kind of spearheaded this radicalization do you know carter uh yes i've met him before he came here at itp to give a presentation okay so you know you know what he's done yeah yeah and uh so a lot i i read robert hodgins um uh post about going going trying to figure out how to deal with the distances and the sizes of uh of the astronomical objects and presumably carter and his uh exstudents have wrestled with this and come up with this solution so you can you can see what you think when you see that working too awesome so now i've now i've hijacked your information here no no there's no so this is just actually a test we are just trying to test to see if this system here in this room which i've been using to record stuff could also be broadcast live and the things that the thing that i've discovered is you google hangouts which you can broadcast um people can't just add themselves they have to be invited so i need a system by which i either have people in advance or that they can um as well as sort of hard to kind of manage and figure out like if people can ask a question or whatever but i i i thank you for calling in because that was really helpful to kind of test this and i'm gonna just kind of see if there are any other uh twitter messages or emails of other people who might want to ask a question or try and i'm probably oh it's 4 15 i'll probably turn this i have to go soon so i'll probably turn this off okay you better better get on to your other customers i did have one more question how do you do the superimposition of you on the screen have you got a little device there so um this has actually been done so you're referring to the fact that yeah yeah so um the good news is i'm going to we've made a documentation video about how all of this stuff works in this room which i just need to post which will explain it with more detail but the short answer is um there is a camera and a laptop and both the feed from the camera which is recording me excuse me in the feed from the laptop which is you're seeing here both go into one machine as capture devices and software called wirecast is uh compositing them and this is just a green screen so right here is a green screen which you can actually see i think i'm in the hangout right right i figured it was a green you can see this is there's the actual laptop yep this is just a green screen and uh they're being if this is obviously the noncomposited view uh there and then this is the composite view yep thank you awesome thanks for calling and i'll be in touch over email okay okay all right let's see um okay so let's see what else oh i'm in the wrong place here um i guess i'm going to i feel like i should have a song or something to finish off with let's see either no other twitter messages there are there's a youtube comment that says hi and i don't have any emails so um i think actually it's 4 15 this was a good test if you like this maybe we'll do it again um i don't know what's a nice song uh to finish off with uh we were testing uh audio with fanfare from the cop for the common man of course they're gonna make us watch an ad hey it's interesting because i can't tell it's just like think this ad thank you everyone for tuning in if um i don't know that i'll do another test uh i don't know that i will do another test this summer uh but i will i might do one more test this summer uh but the we're going to kind of organize this a bit more and try to make this a weekly event where you could possibly ask questions over twitter maybe maybe you could join the hangout to actually be here and ask questions i don't know if anyone's watching um but i guess this gets recorded so um and maybe some way of like sharing sketches through dropbox so if you have ideas uh for how this might work better or if you have a question you want to ask for like again i probably do this till september you can send me an email um know with your sketch attached so i'm gonna figure out how to turn this off which i think i have to go to this computer and click end the broadcast i'm gonna click end broadcast i think the hangout will still be here but the broadcast will open
