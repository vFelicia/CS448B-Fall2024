okay this is our last video about toxic libs Verla physics course that's a huge topic and there's probably more things to fill in that we can get to later something today but here in this video it's me short sweet to the point we're gonna demonstrate something super powerful but quite elegantly simple in toxic libs the attraction behavior so one of the things you can do in toxic libs is make an object called an attraction behavior attraction behavior and we'll call it a B equals a new attraction behavior it's a lot of stuff to write and it just takes three arguments 1 2 3 so what are those three arguments first of all what does this even do I mean come on here so let's say we have a verlan physics world and it has a bunch of particles to it what we're saying is we want to assign this particle and attraction behavior we want to say that this particle is attractive meaning any other particle in the world will experience a force that pulls that particle towards it it so there so seems like a simple concept but remember when you have lots and lots of particles to calculate every force between every single one it's kind of a complex task we could have a thousand particles we make a whole bunch of them attractive and a whole bunch and them not with different degrees of attraction and a negative by the way attraction is a repulsive as a repulsion there's a lot that we can do here so how do we make a particle attractive well first we have to create the attraction behavior and that attraction behavior is going to get assigned to a particle object how is it assigned we have to pass in as the first argument is which particle which particle is the one that is going to experience this attraction behavior I think that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right ok sorry I got confused for a second what is the second the the second argue and the second argument I will call the radius of attraction so one of the nice things about these behaviors is they can oh they can we can constrain when they be enabled so we can say only particles within this particular radius will experience that attraction force so this particle will and this particle will and this particle won't and this particle won't this is very powerful because we can make something very very attractive only when things are very close to it or very prevent well that actually very very repulsive only when things are really close to it or very very attractive when things are very far away from it there's a lot that we can do there so that radius of attraction that's a floating point something like 100 pixels and the last thing that we want to do is this strength so the strength of it is how strong is that attraction I mean what's the range for that I don't know negative infinity to positive infinity probably some reasonable numbers between like negative 5 and 5 or you know probably going to work well for the types of systems you're building but the important thing to realize is this can be positive or negative so we don't need attraction behaviors and repulsion behaviors we just have attraction behaviors but when something is and has a negative attraction it is repulsive and I don't think that as a qualitative judgment that it's not nice to look at it could be a very beautiful particle that's just has a repulsion associated with it but the Pelin talking about one thing that's interesting about this by the way that I should just point out before we look at the example is we did say that toxic lips does not have collisions does not have collision geometry but there are ways that we can make things we can make a we can approximate collisions with with without geometry and one of the ways we can do that is with a very very very strong repulsive behavior that gets enabled within a small radius so you can imagine this particle coming along this way and once it gets very very near it shoots out because it's repelled by that particle and if this one also repels that one they shoot out in opposite directions it will appear as if those particles have come together and bounced off of each other we're not checking the a geometry we're not doing a kind of rotation of the velocity pool cue balls billiard simulation but we're gonna get something very very similar and that's something you might try to do as a little exercise for yourself by the way this is a guessed too much of an aside but I'm just gonna mention it one of the really innovative things that that Nokia friends example that I showed it by carsten schmidt does is if you have strangelyshaped geometry one thing you could do is as they get near each other you could create a bunch of spring connections that suddenly get added and connected between those objects and s object come in those Springs contract and then push it away and then you delete those Springs so that's another way really that's kind of an advanced technique to figure that out but quite possible if you know all of these vertices there's no reason why you couldn't connect a bunch of vertices to another objects vertices that are particles with Springs so anyway there are ways of getting collision like things to happen in toxic lips I'm I'm speaking in generalities here let's go back to that attraction and an attraction behavior so if we come over here to this particular example I'm going to run it and we're going to see a couple things about this example number one all of the objects are attracted to this Center object called the attractor and you can see as I move it around they follow it this has an attraction behavior all of those particles themselves have repulsion behaviors you can see that's why they're not overlapping or coming in they're kind of like selforganizing into this nicely spaced out system because they don't want to get in within a certain distance of each other so just briefly I'm going to take out that repulsion behavior just so we can see what this looks like this is yet another I think we've done this like you know three times now we did attraction with with a formula for gravitational attraction we've added that into box 2d and now here we have it here in toxic libs we get it for free by just saying hey this attractor is a particle object and here look physics dot add behavior new attraction behavior and let's look at this let's go backwards point one is the strength with is the radius of attraction so anything within the entire screen we just use the width of the window anything on the screen is attracted this particle and then the particle is this oh boy so this is a little moment of confusion let's go back over here and say I erased that but we can get it back right let's we're gonna make this look this is gonna make so much sense to us when we look at this it's gonna be a really nice moment okay if we're making this attraction behavior we're making a new attraction behavior and the first thing we have to put in there is which particle is going to be assigned that attraction behavior okay so let's make a particle particle p1 is a new particle and hey that's the particle that should experiencing and here's the width and here's the strength the radius and the strength right this is how we might normally write it and there are plenty of examples where you will write it this way make the attraction behavior assign it to that particle p1 but something strange is going on in this example no pun intended I've got the word this there what is this class attractor extends particle four vertel a particle to D if you ever have done anything in Java before you might have encountered the word this this is kind of like saying me it's this like selfreferential introspective thoughtful way of saying Who am I at this moment Who am I at this moment I'm an attractor this particular attractor whatever attractor has just been made that's the one that should get this that's the one that should get this attraction behavior so in other words if we have a class I'm gonna to call fish right we made up our own fish class and there we're making a new attraction behavior and I'm just gonna kind of scribble this out right that's where we put this in what that means is this particular fish the object that we're in we're in the fish class this fish gets a sign that attraction behavior this of course only works if fish extends verlet particle right because we need the only types of things that can be assigned an attraction behavior are valid particles so we either make the particle and assign it or we or we're in the class and we sign it to the object that's currently being made at that time this particular object so you know this is the kind of this is the kind of stuff that's confusing and awkward and weird but you know hopefully that makes some sense to you and and and the thing to just remember is this is another word for like a me Who am I know that else okay so we're back over here and we can see we're adding the attraction behavior with 0.1 we run this we can see everything is attracted now if we go back to particle we could say ah we're doing the same thing attraction behavior to particle R times 4 so R is the size of the circle we're saying anything that comes with it actually R is the radius of the circle that width is the diameter R times 2 but anything that comes within the radius of the circle times 4 it's going to experience this repulsion force which is gonna be pretty strong at negative 1 and one thing I just want to show you if I take this out and say R times just not R times 4 and we kind of let it stabilize a little bit you can see that these circles are allowed to come much closer together now they're still repelled by each other a little bit and if I say something like R times 10 which would be much more extreme right those circles really don't want to get near each other and you can see how that repulsion force is very very strong and they're kind of staying spread out so how we tune those forces is the attraction force stronger is the repulsive force stronger a great exercise by the way I think to try and I'm gonna mention this that you could do is create a system here's an exercise for you this is my assigned exercise to like do it someday but is create a particle it has two attraction behaviors a very very strong repulsion behavior with a small radius and a slightly weaker attraction behavior with a large radius this means that any particle that wanders in will start to be attracted will come on in and when it gets too close it will be repelled and you might get this interesting thing where particles kind of come in repel come in repel so it's kind of it that's something you might try as an experiment can you make a report of an both a repulsion and an attraction force obviously with different radii and different strengths okay so hopefully this helps you a little bit I encourage you to also take a look I think I mentioned this already but there is a wonderful example I'm just gonna pull it up under you can see it if you go to contributed library examples called attraction 2d this is a wonderful example which I encourage you to look at also which demonstrates attraction and repulsion forces here a whole lot of particles all with repulsion forces pouring into this Berlet physics world that has gravity and as I move the mouse it creates an attraction force and you get this kind of fluid like behavior well really really simple example is just particles with attraction behaviors and it's really nice that you can kind of do this stuff so easily with toxic lives and a lot that you can do here with this stuff okay great I hope you enjoyed this series of videos about toxic lives and stay tuned in the next set of videos we will will come back and talk about steering behaviors we're going to go back to actually not using any physics libraries for a little while to look at that kind of details of steering libraries and then of course if you want to you can add all those steering forces into box D and toxic libs examples as well thank you and see you later
