trigonometry this video is about trigonometry I hope you're excited about that okay we said before what what trigonometry is it is the study of the relationships between the angles and sides of a right triangle now if you ever took some type of geometry class or some sort of maybe in high school you learned about trigonometry you might have learned this very odd and strange pneumonic device so TOA now I'm not sure how much that really helps you because it's kind of hard to remember just that but if you can remember soaa then you can remember s cosine and tangent so what I want to First do in um in this video is review what s means what cosine means what tangent means and we're going to see how those can be applied in some scenarios particularly when we want to draw something on the screen in terms of something called polar coordinates we're going to look at this thing called polar coordinates we we always draw things in cartisian coordinates there's this XY location there's this width there's this height we're going to think about polar coordinates so soaa what does that mean well let's say we have a right triangle that means a triangle with an angle that's 90Â° a right angle right over here Pi / 2 and there is some angle here now often angles are written in sort of the world of notation as the Greek letter Theta so you might even see in some code examples float Theta equals or you could always say float angle equals obviously you can name variables whatever you want but Theta is a common symbol or term for an angle okay so we have this angle Theta and this side of the triangle this is the opposite side because is opposite from the angle this is the adjacent side it is adjacent to the angle and this is the hypot hypotenuse okay so here's our right triangle angle angle adjacent opposite hypotenuse okay what is s s is opposite divided hypotenuse so s of theta is opposite divid hypotenuse what is cosine adjacent divided by hypotenuse cosine of the is adjacent divided hypotenuse and tangent of theta is opposite divided adjacent so these form formulas come up again and again in many different scenarios one scenario in particular that we're going to look at not in this video is a swinging pendulum if you think this is a pendulum this is the force of gravity on the pendulum pointing down but this is the direction of that the pendulum is going to move you can see we've made a right triangle here we need the force of the pendulum which is a comp so we're gonna do lots of stuff there's GNA be lots of diagrams involved and things that we're going to make that suddenly have a right triangle in them and we have to say ah we know this side of the triangle but not this side oh and we know the angle or we know the sides and we don't know the angle right different scenarios we're going to know different things and if we know the sides we can get the angle if we know the angle we can get the sides etc etc so that's what's going to come up again and again one scenario that I want to look at in this video this hopefully less than 10minute video is looking at polar coordinates polar coordinates is a place a an opportunity for us to use the um basics of trigonometry in a sketch okay so what do I mean by polar coordinates so let's say we have a a a cartisian coordinate space now I'm going to draw a traditional one not a a processing window but we'll map that in a moment to a code example with in a processing window so this is a twodimensional uh cartisian space okay two dimensional space now we might have we have an xaxis we have a y axis we could say hey this is the point uh 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 four I don't know right this is the point 5 comma 4 that's its cartisian coordinate it has an X of five a y of four so everything in this space we could think of in terms of what's its x value 3 45 four right of its X and Y a polar coordinate is a different way of thinking about a location in two dimension space instead of describing an X and A Y that is cartisian a polar coordinate describes an r and a Theta what do we mean by that an r and a Theta so you can get anywhere on the screen by saying hey go to this X and go to this y or you could say rotate by this angle and go to this radius right so this is a way of um thinking about uh locations on the screen now here's the problem when in processing if I go to say hey let's draw a circle somewhere I can't say R comma Theta right processings drawing functions Point vertex ellipse line wct they only accept cartisian coordinates so if we want to think sometimes we want to think in terms of polar coordinates right when would we want to think in terms of polar coordinates well what if we want our motion to move like this well that could just be Ching the angle instead of saying x++ like x++ moves this way angle Plus+ would rotate the object r++ or our angle rotating and like what if we want to do a spiral if the radius shrinks while we're rotating that's a spiral pattern so we could get spiral motion very easily by thinking in terms of polar coordinates but then how do we draw polar coordinates how do we set something at a polar coordinate well let's look at how we're going to do that let's say we know something is at a particular Theta with a particular R so this is my polar coordinate R comma Theta well this is the Y value and this is the x value Bo did I draw that terribly we can make a right triangle the cartisian coordinate is X comma y if we know R comma Theta how could we get X comma y well what is sine of theta in this instant s of theta is opposite over hypotenuse opposite is y hypotenuse is r y / R cosine of theta is adjacent which is x ided r x ided r okay now we're really this is super exciting okay what's Happening Here we could solve for x or y so easily right I don't know if you like doing stuff with equations but if you like doing stuff with equations you can see here just multiply each side of the equation by R right Y is actually equal to R * s of theta X is equal to R time cosine of theta right if I multiply this side of the equation by R the RS cancel each other out and I have y = r * sin Theta so this is a formula this formula right here this simple simple formula says if I know the r the the radius and angle of a polar coordinate I know the Y if I and since I know the radius and angle of a polar coordinate I know the X so we could think in terms of polar coordinates and draw in terms of cartisian coordinates and that opens up a lot of possibilities um so let's take a look at an actual example that does this over here okay hello again now we're over here um okay so let's just say we're going to have some Global variable called r r in this case let's say is is going to be 50 and we're going to have some angle I'm just going to call it a which is going to be zero stupid P okay now I'm going to make a I forgot to draw stuff here a black background and I'm going to translate just for to the center of the window because I think that'll be simplest and then I'm going to draw a circle I can't draw it at R comma Theta I'm going draw it at something called X comma y so now how how do I get X comma y I know R and angle I want X and Y remember formula right over there x = r * cosine of the angle y = r * s of the angle so now that we've done that I don't know make sure our circle is white uh what did I oh oh we need to declare these variables oh I'm not over here ah sorry I was typing for a little while sorry about that g uh this one's going to have to be fixed but I'm going to just keep going so um we have a little circle now you the radius is only 50 which isn't that far let's actually draw a line just so we can see that line also uh so we can see there is our let's make the radius a little bit bigger right there is our object at a polar ordinate the it's a radius of 150 and a angle of zero what if I change the angle to Pi ID 4 there we can see it's 40 45 degrees rotated and what if I do something like say hey let's apply angular velocity angular acceleration let's all those rules of angular uh oops all those rules that we used before we can apply here now we have this whoa it's like you're swinging something super exciting in the air um so okay so what have we got here look this looks strangely oddly like the just uh and and I'm going to um I'm going to use a constraint here to limit angular velocity between zero and just say one that's probably too big anyway but um so um what's interesting about this example is this looks remarkably familiar it looks kind of like the example we just did this is just we could use translate and rotate to create this exact same effect but here we chose let's actually we want to kind of be in charge of the XY positions of objects we don't want to just let translate and rotate in the Transformations do it for us we're using math polar to cartisian coordinate transformation different scenarios require different options it's a nice to be able to kind of do both of them and that was kind of an insane uh large um acceleration for me to constrain to okay so uh as an exercise what I would suggest for you to do is try to think of some type of pattern a spiral pattern is a good one but if you were to what happens if R changes by pear and noise what happens if the angle changes by pear and noise what if you shrink the angle grow the angle how could you create some type of motion path that is different from just like moving in A Perfect Circle what what what ways could you vary R and Vary the angle to create different kinds of motion that you couldn't do so easily with just um uh moving an object's position around okay so uh I think we're in good shape now that we understand trigonometry the next thing we're going to do in the next video is see how sign and cosine how the the properties of those functions um um Can map to oscillating motion to wave patterns okay great goodbye
