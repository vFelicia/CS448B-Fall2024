in New York hello hello how does the focus okay check your chat voice not good okay one's gonna send the voices not good anyone here I'm going to the hole for a second because when we go too far for audio it's not good if you're watching this in the archives on ticket in 30 seconds yes the voice on the cracker okay let me see what I can do about that wine will be doing test chest is that better test test is this any better now sorry for this technical problem and this is very unfortunate test test tests work say I can yeah guess I could put on headphones I do it let me find my headphones my mic is kaput okay I'm trying to turn anywhere listen you test test test test test is this any better oh it's okay now is it okay now oh great okay okay give me a second everybody okay good I'm glad I fixed it bad cable somewhere if it's too might be too loud because I was turning things up and down let me just get myself resituated confirm that everything is good okay okay oh wait I have to click one thing here okay is it okay now is the audio okay I'm gonna listen with my headphones just to be sure oh great okay great okay so we are back I am back I am 10 minutes into this thing okay so the first 10 minutes of this is hogwash if that's a word that makes any sense to use this context I don't know welcome let me start over again I'm gonna my name is Dan I'm just moving some things around here I'm here live at ITP I actually have not recorded a video or been live sent I'm we're just gonna since 2015 in December was the last time that I recorded anything I've been away and a bunch of things have been going on I am hoping to starting in March my plan is to actually do this twice per week at a regular time where I will do a bunch of different things just random topics answer questions as well as perhaps follow some specific curriculum so there might be like a continuing hood it's kind of like things that you can watch just as a oneoff or things you can watch over time or a place where you can ask questions I haven't really figured at all yet out yet but I'm hoping to focus on this make more videos that sort of things so be in touch on Twitter and the YouTube comments that sort of thing so today I'm really I'm the least prepare for this that I've ever been in the sense that I just happened to be here at ITP so I thought I would turn the setup on and try to make some videos something that I thought about I think that the topic that I'll start with and you guys can think about if you have if you have other questions is something that comes up all the time in my courses is how to make an object like a thing that moves around the screen that stores a history of its path as it's moving around the screen and essentially draws a trail for itself and you can do this by just not erasing the background so you see the trail but what if you want to race the background what if you want to have its path also move and do respond to physics and that sort of thing so this I think is going to be a useful demonstration and then I'll take out so I'm going to do that it's probably 10 or 15 minutes and then I hopefully will think of some other things too or look at my list of topics or take questions and that sort of so so that's that I think I will do this in p5.js I could do it both processing and p5.js excuse me what I was like if like I was about to burp which would be an awkward thing to do in a live stream but it's certainly I'm sure that's happened before what I want to look for is p5.js org download and I want to go down to the editor yeah I don't think on this computer I there is a slightly newer version of the editor version 0.5 0.7 here it comes Donna could delete that and extract this and copy to the desktop replace so I think so yes I want to open it so what I'm going to do here it is first I'm sorry in getting width so I'm gonna get ready for this how am I going to get ready for this the first thing that I'll do is create an object that moves around the screen according to some set of rules maybe we'll do some combination randomness or some combination of Perlin noise so okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna make a like ten minute video lesson that's going to be the core material for this but and I'm gonna record that separately and in a post that as a separate video but as a warmup I'm gonna start getting ready for that so to get ready for that the first thing I'm going to do is make a another tab here in the p5 editor I'm just going to call it particle jf and I'm going to make a particle object and that particle object is going to have annex and you'll be able to make the particle object at any given X at any given Y so this this particular tutorial that I'm gonna do is sort of assumes all the foundation stuff with JavaScript programming and p5.js that I've already done in previous videos you guys give me an idea if you have an idea for how this thing should move around the screen that's maybe different than randomness but I'll make a update function and I forget that I'm making a constructor function so this dot update equals function and this dot render show I'm going to do show equals function and we'll make this thing a nice little circle that is perhaps some shade of gray with some alpha and maybe a black outline and update would be like just to get this going right now let's just move it randomly this is kind of not a very interesting thing to do so right now I'm making oh and I'm not I'm sort of out of practice with this I have this in the wrong place is this font size big enough can you get is this clear in watching the video um if you're in the chat well thirtyfive people are watching now that's crazy that's a lot more than I usually have in these like live streams who done this for a while it's a good sign okay hello people who are watching so I'm getting ready to do something interesting that I think will be useful for some of you who are learning about programming and stuff but I'm just sort of getting ready to it the first thing that I've done is just written a constructor function for a very generic particle a particle it just has an x and y the x and y change randomly and it has a function to draw itself as a circle so if I go now I'm going to save this just to the desktop here as history um let me say it make a folder with today's date which is February 9th and I'm going to save this as particle history 1 so now when I go to the main sketch I want to make a variable called P maybe I'll call it particle and say particle new particle 100/100 and I should create a canvas that is I don't know 400 by 300 and I should draw a background which will be slightly gray and I will say particle dot update particle dot show so I just wanted to get something very basic going here in preparation ok particle is not defined aha oh this really should be a feature of this nest nice editor so I need to go to the sidebar under index and I need to add a reference to the particle J s file I'm gonna hide the side I'm doing all this stuff quickly because this is just the preparatory stuff I'm gonna run it ok there we go we got our particle there it is moving randomly ok so I'm getting ready now let's think about this how should we have this particle move in a more interesting way could you please lift both your hands and yell I lost my hands thank you I don't know what that means but I got obliged a strange request to the chat it says I lost my hands I don't know why but well if you just type something the chat asked me to do it I'm not necessarily gonna do it though ok hello everyone live great it's great to see people here in the chat so I would like this particle to move around in a more interesting way how about we use Perlin noise to move it so first of all it's so tiny let's make it a little bit bigger I'll make it 24 that's good and let's have it move with some oh and the cameras are going let's have it move with some pearly noise that's a probably a hole actually you know I don't know if I want to do the purlin purlins noises then this video kind of depends on Perlin noise what if I have it move with well let's just have it be a bouncing ball that's sort of uh pick your nose let's have it just be a bit so let's have it be a bouncing ball so I'm gonna do why I'm gonna add a Y speed and have it change by Y speed only the Y and I'm going to add a gravity variable and I'm gonna have the this dot Y speed change by this gravity and honestly I don't think it makes sense for gravity to be part of the object just make that a global variable this is something interesting to think about a little bit of an aside as I get ready to do this particular lesson that I'm gonna launch into in a second which is that I'm making this thing called a particle and the particle has properties it has its position it has its speed and having to have a size it might have a color and I was about to give it the property of gravity but then I thought to myself gravity that's really conceptually part of the world it's not part of the object so instead I made it a variable outside of the object in this case I don't really matter so much you know all this is just sort of made up anyway for the purpose of something I'm going to show you in a moment and if we do this now if we run this we can see it's falling with gravity and probably under update then I should check if it gets if it goes beyond the screen then let's set its white pipe back onto the screen and reverse its speed into the other direction so now we have this bouncing object okay so we have this object that bounces great and let's have it it's bounced slowed down a little bit when it hits the bottom okay so I think I'm getting ready to do the first recording which will be uploaded as a separate standalone video and in this particular video what I'm going to demonstrate I'm going to say this again in two seconds is I'm going to demonstrate how to have this object store its own path without simple as an array inside of the object itself okay this comes up all the time I've seen people trying to do all sorts of thing with with this and yeah so this will be useful a plate okay sinewave sine wave would have been good too I think we'll do some people do something about sine simple harmonic motion and sine waves maybe in another quick video it's already 1130 because I lost all that time is a stupid audio okay so let me move over here for a second to drink some of this tea can you guys read this okay lighting in here and everything is fine okay I don't really love the bouncing ball things going off my hair okay the ball is going up yeah isn't that interesting I thought I think I just didn't run it again it's a little bit of a rounding issue now now that won't happen now that I open I'm over here okay all right I'm not definitely out of practice doing these so yeah it's good if I do the member I haven't done this in over a month I definitely need to do these every week okay please give it a name it's the name oh you're right it is still going up I guess no I don't know if this I guess I'll be a little bit more I know somebody suggest a name for this party it should be the rainbow blue rain ball rainbow ball ball bow it's a particle I don't like to use the word ball it's not really a ball there so it's really just a particle as a thing on the screen but anyway here we go I'm gonna get ready so I have this other system I got to make sure this works actually because I had a problem with this the other day and so when I have to test something really quickly that's fine record to disk I sim 2015 mp4 16 by 9 okay I'm going to I'm gonna hit record and I'm gonna do test test test this is a test test test I'm testing something to make sure it works okay and now I'm gonna look on the desktop of this computer you can't see what I'm doing and then I make sure something recorded it looks like it recorded and maybe I can I'm gonna turn the audio for a second okay that worked excellent so my recording thing works I got to turn the audio back off so I'm gonna get feedback and close this and it is still going up like crazy and stop it from doing that okay okay here we go I am ready now boy mmm really out of practice on this alright so let's see I'm now going to start hello and welcome to start over it's forever okay I'm gonna close this I'm gonna I'm gonna close my view of the chat and get going on this okay hello welcome in this video I'm going to demonstrate how to take let me run this again how to have an object on the screen store a history of its path now this object just happens to be a bouncing ball it's bouncing up and down but you could maybe have something move and spiral pattern or something move along a sine wave or use something called Perlin noise or move randomly or maybe you've watched them on my other videos where I show how to have things respond to forces the point is you have something that you've already programmed to move around the screen what if you want to draw a trail or to have that history of its path for some other purpose like this comes up a lot so on the one hand you might already say oh I know how to do this right because in the basics of using an environment like processing or p5.js there's this background function and the background function erases the background so if you were to take the background function from draw which is continuously erasing the background and move it in to set up now we can see this object is drawing a trail and you can barely see it moving anymore which is something that I should have considered probably but you can see that it's drawing a trail but it's kind of this is not really a good solution because a it's continuously drawing its trail forever I can't have some things draw one trail something's not draw a trail something's draw a long trail something's wrong sure trail I can't have the things in the trail changing color or moving according to their own set of principles so in order to do something anything any idea that you have that's a bit more sophisticated beyond just see the things sort of like smearing a trail of its path along the screen you're gonna need to keep that background in draw and figure out a way for the object itself to store a history of its own path so let's think about how we might do that I feel obligated to use the whiteboard for a second even though I don't know that it's necessary so let's kind of unpack this a little bit we have on the screen we have a circle maybe it's moving maybe it's your program it's some sort of like ants like insect like creature and it's moving around and what you want is for it to have almost like this like body that it pulls along along its path in some type of way oh this would be a good topic for a video looking at inverse kinematics all that stuff to create like a skeleton oh that's gonna be good it'll do that in another video here we just want the trail so the object if we think of this object as called a particle as a very generic term for a thing moving around the screen this particle has an X this particle has a Y and now what is this particle deed in addition to the X and the y it needs to have something that I'll call a history and that history can be an array because what this particle will do is it stores its X Y as its current location but another property of it is actually an array where it can keep track of older x and y's and older x and y's and older x and y's so let's look at how that might be done so if I come back over here to this particular example you can see the basics of the code right there's a particle object it makes a new particle object in setup and then that particle object update and show where all of the code world the stuff for that particle object is is over here in this constructor function and you can see it's just got some basic stuff it has an X and a Y variable it has a wide speed variable because all this thing is doing is moving up and down it changes Y by Y speed it changes Y speed by gravity it checks if it gets to the bottom then if it gets to the bottom it reverses its direction and then it also has a function to display itself so what I'm suggesting to you here is the first thing that we need to do is add another property to this object the way that we add a property this object is by saying this object this thing this particle thing that's going to be made through this constructor function this dot the name of that property and I'm going to call it a history and I'm going to make it an array so this is a wonderful thing about working in JavaScript I'm after I do this video I'll make a version of this code in processing and I'll upload both examples so you have the p5 and the processing version but the JavaScript version will be a little bit simpler because an array in JavaScript natively is a thing that you can just start as an empty thing and start filling it with stuff whereas in processing in Java I'll have to build the example with something called an ArrayList and I will link to other videos about how ArrayList worked at some point there so okay so this is our first start here we make this history variable so what do we do with that history variable every time the object updates its location every time it moves I want to store where it previously was how do I do that so how do I add something to an array so this is the update function right here right this is where the wat its X&Y location might change it's moving around the screen so what I want to do is add something here where I say this dot history and I want to somehow I would have like add something into this history so the way that you add something to an array in JavaScript it away that one there's many ways you can do it but one way you can sum to add something to the end of that array is with a function called push so if I were to say push dot X what I'm doing is I'm saying take this object's current X location and by the way I can't say X I have to say what JavaScript this dot X I have to take this object's current X and put it into the array so if I did this and ran this program every time an update it would say save its X in the array save its X in the array and that array would just become full of its ex locations and we could do something amusing I don't know how amusing this would be I'm gonna say print its history out and you can see here right I'm getting I'm printing out these arrays and there's just tons of values of 100 because it's X is never changing so why don't I put its Y in there and you can see I look the Y values are just being stored the history of its Y values are being stored in that array oh well maybe I should put both the X and the y and you could sort of see now that array has X Y XY XY X Y X Y so just think of the push function you could just push a bunch of things in the array by separating them but this is this while this is fine it's worth noting that's something that's going to make our life much easier to do this particular example is using something called a vector so let me come back over here for a second and talk briefly about what a vector is if you haven't encountered it before and I'm probably gonna do some other videos and that go through this stuff in more detail but let's say I have an object oh this pen is terrible let's say I have an object whose location is at an x and a y I could have separate x and y variables or I could have a variable that I'll call a vector and what I could do in p5 is I can call a function called create vector and give it two values can you see that you can I've gone off the here look live fixing live editing this is what I do a live editing just gonna move the camera a little bit so you can see that so instead of having a separate X&Y variable I can have a single variable using the create vector function to put an x and y in well why does that work why is that relevant well a vector is essentially one way of thinking of a vector is as an arrow or directions for how to get from one place to another and here in this case an object's location is a vector for how to get from the origin to where it's actually being displayed the you can think of this as a triangle with a y component and an X component so this arrow is a vector so instead of that big array that I want to fill instead of trying to put an X than a Y then an X than Y then an X than a y it'll be much simpler if I say let's put a vector an XY and then put another vector another XY so I can kind of group the history as its position is this XY then its position was this XY that history is a whole bunch of vectors so over here now if I come back to the code what I want to do is I'm gonna say var V V equals create vector this X this dot Y and I'm now going to push that vector into the array and run this again and so now as this program is running as this is running over and over again this history array is getting like bigger and bigger and bigger let's take a look at that let's let's look in the console at this dot history dot length so you can see as the program is running I'm just storing over and over again a vector for every single point that this object has ever been so right if I wanted to draw a trail of everywhere it's ever been then I can simply do that pretty easily because I have all those points in an array I feel like I pause fast questions but I can't pause because I'm just making this as a video okay so we've now we've got the core mechanic here now which is just this which is just like every time as the object gets updated take its current location save a copy of it stored in the array so let's do something with that now let's in the display function I could always now say I could have a loop to go through that entire array and I could draw and of course I'm forgetting to save this this and now this is a little bit what I think might be worth doing here's make a variable called position which is this dot history index I so here what I'm doing is right here this is an important little thing to look at for a second is I want when I'm going to draw this object in addition to drawing its current XY I'm gonna go through and loop through the entire history and pull out each and every spot in history index 0 index 1 index 2 and those things are vectors and I'm going to store them in a variable called pause for a position and now if I want to draw another circle there I can just say pause dot X pause dot Y and I'll make this a smaller circle and we can see now if I run this program you can see it is drawing a circle at every spot in its history and now you know what I I had this idea where like all a bouncing ball is gonna make sense and I just I just don't like it anymore let's let's get rid of this idea of Y speed and grab let's just be much simpler about this and let's just chain and let's get rid of this bouncing thing let's just do what I originally set out to do which I think will demonstrate this idea much better which is just to have it move randomly so I'm just changing this particle to instead of bouncing up and down to have it move randomly so you can see now as it's moving randomly it's leaving a circle everywhere it's ever been in its path and I do I am erasing I am erasing the background each time so this allows me to do lots of different things for example you know each one of those circles could be drawn randomly they're their size could be random you know just so you can see here I don't I don't know what the value of this is but you can see that those things can be animated in their own way I don't particularly like what I've done with randomness but there's a lot of possibilities there so this is the simple idea right that instead of just drawing a circle at its location also store a and a also keep track of an array that stores a copy of its location over time and draw something there so I want to add a few things to this number one is I think it might make sense to limit that history right so one thing we could say is if this dot history dot length is greater than 25 then this dot history dot splice splice is a function that allows you to pull out things from the array and the oldest thing in the array is the first thing index number 0 and I want to just take one thing out of the array so this place function takes two arguments the index where you want to delete something and how many things you want to delete which is just one so now if we run it you can see and let's have it move idle so you can see here and goodbye it left the screen those are too large let me I came back that was nice of it and we could do something like have its size just be I so you can see that come back okay well let's do something else too okay ah so here's the amazing thing about doing this I only have one particle and this is like at first I have this like tiny window so just so we can see more stuff happening let's put that in the middle so what's oh in its Oh ed etre you should have changed your size but you didn't so you can see that this gives you a lot more potential now in things that you can do in terms of having this thing store its own history I like barely scratch the surface if so many better ideas you probably have good ideas too but what I at least want to do is expand this now because the point of having done this and encapsulating this entire idea of the history inside of this object right the entire capturing the history inside of this object now what's possible is let me make this called particles let me not have any particles in setup and let me loop through I'm gonna let me make an array of all the possible particles and let me say particles index i dot update particles index i dot show so now what I've done is I've changed the main program from having just this one single particle to starting with an empty array of particles at any of the particles that are there they all should update in the all should show now of course there's none now why because we haven't added any so now what's exciting about this is let's say anytime I click the mouse let's add write adding something to an array with the push function new particle and let's add it where the mouse is so now if I run this look at this I click there click there all of these objects are all storing their own history and I can just keep making many of them so this is pretty great because now you know and just to demonstrate that the background is 100% the background is not being erased I can have something else move I'm gonna just move frame count modulus width I don't know this is gonna work boy I'm like oh let me not do this I'm just gonna say frame count zero frame count height just to see like there's something moving across the screen that is not drawing a trail so we can have some things draw a trail we can have a lot of control over that trail being that what's the size of that trail do the objects do they change color do they animate that sort of thing so let me like to addictiveness I'm like at 15 minutes you can just stop this and do something else but I want to do a couple more things with this so you see this basic example one thing that I think would be useful to demonstrate is to see that a common thing that you'll want to do is actually draw the trail as oh and I'm over here now so a common thing come on button a common thing that you might want to do is with this object draw the trail as a continuous set of lines like that and a way of doing that is with a begin shape and end shape so I'm going to comment out the ellipse and I can say begin shape at the beginning of the loop and n shape at the end of the loop and just say vertex pause dot X pause dot Y so what I'm actually doing here is making a new shape that's going to appear on this Green and all the vertices of that shape are going to be made up of the history of that object so if I run this and click you can see that shape now weirdly enough that shape is closed and it has a fill so a couple things I want to do is I want to say no fill the other thing I might want to do is I think I want to make this let this be a lot longer and let this be a hundred and we can run this and you can see now you can see that it's drawing this like squiggly line and again if you change this to have it move more smoothly or some other different algorithm you can imagine how useful this might be and again I can have all of them continue to do this now here's the other thing that's amazing about this not only do we have this history stored as data but because we have this history stored as data in an array those things can change so there's no reason why I couldn't say while the object is moving in its update function right it's update function does what it changes the X&Y location then it stores a copy of that exile on location in its history but there's no reason why while it's moving I couldn't also loop through the entire array and have history and I always forget that this this I could say this dot history index I dot X move randomly and index I dot y move randomly so what I've added here is I'm saying aha in addition to the object's location moving its history those points also move as well so now if I draw something you can see that its history is kind of like undulating as it moves as well all those vert vert X's vertices have their own kind of motion tips so again I don't really like necessarily my own visual result here because the only thing I'm using as the driving force behind the motion is randomness but you could imagine what sort of possibilities might there be there in terms of a creature design in terms of color in terms of smooth motion in terms of oscillating motion get boy like having all of those points like sort of oscillating is this if it's like a waving fish or something or waving there's just so many possibilities so I hope that I'm gonna upload this code example complete this upload this video upload the code example make a p5 version make a processing version if you make something built off of this example please share it with me in the comments I don't understand how this video became 20 minutes long but it did and I hope that you found it somewhat useful goodbye and see you in the next video someday okay I'm coming back to the chat hope people aren't screaming at me saying that it didn't work okay hello everyone did you watch that there's still lost a lot of people okay there's a lot of questions here let me see if I can kind of like scroll back okay so I I'm just seeing more of a discussion but if you have some questions now about what I just showed or anything at all please ask them in the chat I'm gonna see if I can think of like one other little quick topic to do I have to go probably about 1015 minutes but I'm gonna see if I can do one other thing you just have to bear with me for a second as I kind of look here okay I'm looking I'm gonna look at my where is my I here's my list of ideas yes connect I want to do recording movies out of processing ah this is something I'm gonna do this is perfect yeah everyone's always asking me about this so I'm gonna do this okay the next topic go back to the chat of see if you guys have questions I'm gonna do a quick okay somebody is asking is it possible to download the code later yes it 100% will be I'm going to show you right now where first of all this vid this this will get uploaded as a standalone video to my channel and then I have a github repository github.com slash Schiffman slash video lesson materials so I'm you can see where I am right now I'm gonna link to this in the video's description so you don't need to memorize this but here's where I keep all of the code that with these videos and here it'll probably be under code p5.js and it will this video will get a number or something and the code will be mapped to that based on this number in the title so you'll be able to find it here I will upload it after app you know some point later today is it possible to use p5 in autonomous agents that would be a great topic it's a little bit too big for right now I do have a bunch of videos already about autonomous agents in the processing nature of code playlists those of you are watching live if I go to slash Schiffman when I scroll down under under this one if you go to the nature of code simulating natural systems with processing there's a whole lot of it's more about vectors and chapter 6 is all about autonomous agents so you can take a look at those if you're interested is it possible to use p5 in aftereffects great question and in fact it's essentially the next video I want to make the next quick little lesson I want to do will answer that question so it's a little bit tricky to use p5 and After Effects because the the way that I'm thinking about ok so ok there's a bunch of different possibilities here the stuff that you're programming in p5 are processing is logic and algorithms that generate graphics so what you need to do is store the graphics you've generated in some fashion to import it into aftereffects easy a way to do that would be to just store every single frame of animation as an image file and then you have an image sequence you bring that into After Effects you do whatever you want with it so that's what I'm going to demonstrate how to do in processing in the next video but you could also think about what are you really doing you're making information so you could create everything as you know data files a big spreadsheet with the X&Y in size and color of every position of everything you're drawing and you could somehow import that and render it in a different way and there are standards for doing that so for example 3d 3d modeling you have these different kinds of formats and obj file and you that's just the data for the geometry and so for After Effects I think you could maybe save everything as vector files SVG files or even I don't know if you could import like JSON files somehow in this particular standard format I don't know aftereffects well enough I'm sure somebody could contribute to this discussion well but you absolutely can thanks for your comments Simon that's great to hear while you read the whole nature of good code book in five days that is very exciting to hear all right so I'm gonna move on to the next topic that I want to do I'm just checking Twitter and I'm checking my email to see if anybody has written anything important like please get off the internet No so okay so the next thing I want to do I'm gonna close this and quit this close this save this the cameras are shutting off I'm going to open up prize this three point 0.1 let me make sure that is so the next thing I'm going to do is in processing okay so the next topic that I want to demonstrate which also I get questions for a lot is how to record a video of something you made in processing which you could do to import into After Effects to incorporate in another project or just for documentation purposes that sort of thing so let's go I guess my question is what should I use as the demonstration for this I kind of like let's think of I could just do the flocking system mmm that would be the sort of obvious thing I'm looking under fractals oh you know what's kind of would might be nice let's do I got a good idea let me do the game of life let's record this into a movie file because I think what would be interesting about doing this is if I make it 1920 by 1080 it runs actually runs remarkably fast let me look at the frame rate for that now that's only 12 frames per second okay so that's good sorry I'm so I'm going to do this but we'll start with 640 by 360 we're going to record this as a video render it as a video I'm going to take out this frame rate okay and take this out I don't need this either and I'm gonna delete this I'm gonna save this as a game of life game of life record and I'll put this on the desktop okay this would be a pretty short video okay okay so what I'm gonna do is demonstrate how to record this to a movie files that you could upload to Vimeo or YouTube or bring it into another project and we'll look at some different ways that you could start and stop recording that type of thing okay and I'm going to see how this goes okay sorry I've like lost my train of thought look at the little glider going on there okay uh here we go test test test oh you know what I'm gonna do I'm going to set this running and so it's running and then hit record hello and welcome in this video I'm going to show you how to take a processing sketch and render it to a movie so this comes up a lot there's probably a variety of ways that you could do this I'm gonna show you a particular technique that hopefully will be useful to you so you know I picked this arbitrarily it's one of the examples from my nature of code materials it is a simulation called the game of life a cellular automata system automata boy I'm never gonna get that right ever in my life and it's just it's a an arbitrary animation but anything anything at all that you draw to the screen and processing you can render as a video out of processing why would you want to do this well there's a variety of reasons one is you might want to upload something to Vimeo or YouTube or some other website to host a video you might want to bring this into another project maybe you're working on the animation and and something like After Effects and you want to have some elements that you've programmed in there I can think of some I'll try to include some examples of people have done this kind of work in a YouTube description below so you might want to take what you're doing incorporate into another project in video form another thing might be actually that you just the thing that you made is beautiful but it runs incredibly slow and you want to you don't need it to run in real time so you could render it as a video so that it could run at 30 frames per second and playback as as an installation or whatever it is you might be doing so let's look at how you might do that and there's there's there's a bunch of steps to it and I'll try to go through them so the first thing that I will show you and you know what this font is remarkably small so let me just show you in processing 3 I can go to the preferences I'm gonna change the editor font to 36 and I think that's gonna be a little bit better hopefully you can see that okay so what's the first thing that I want to do to this so what I'm going to do is save so there's there may be some other processing libraries you can get render directly to a movie file but what I'm going to show you how to do instead of rendering directly to a movie file you can always just save what's on the screen as an image so for example if I put save the function save and I say gol dot PNG I'm just gonna put that in draw and I'm going to run it you can see first of all you're gonna if you can tell if it's running slow or not maybe it is maybe it's not I'm gonna close this and I'm gonna go to that sketch folder and you can see right there there now is a file called gol PNG and you can see it's a snapshot of what was on the screen now I was doing that and draw so it was doing it over and over and over again and what we're seeing now is just the last frame that it drew so the save function is away and you might put that in Mouse Prester it attaches you know you might at some point just want to use save just to save a snapshot of what's on the screen but if you use the save frame a function what the save frame function allows you to do is include the pound symbol the hash symbol and what it will do now is auto number the files so every time you call save frame it's going to save GOL underscore one gol underscore two so this now if I'm executing this in draw every time through draw I'm going to get a new image file and I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna try not to run it for very long oops I'll leave it running because now I'm gonna go in and be like oh my goodness and you can see there here it is I have an image file for every single thing that was saved every single frame now I don't like this this is kind of a disaster because I have the zillion files and it's polluting my file system here so I'm gonna delete these and I'm gonna show you what I think would be more useful to do I'm going to make just a directory I'm going to call it output slash gol pound pound pound pound and I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna let it run tempted incident didn't do okay that was enough time and now you can see I have this all here and I can just cycle through it and you can see there it is every single frame and by the way I'm using PNG file format which will save uncompressed so this way the full quality is there in each and every frame this way later on you could choose to compress it or different codec whatever you want to do with your video that's a bit outside the scope so now the question is what do you do with these files so you could bring them into Final Cut Pro or iMovie or MPEG Studio 15 9 zy Pluto magic thing rainbow I don't know it's a repo in there whatever it is you can find your own software lots of software can take an image sequence aftereffects will do this for you and render to a movie it so happens that if you want this sort of quick way of doing it processing up here under the Tools menu under tools there is a moviemaker tool so if I go to click here moviemaker and select it it opens up an interface that says this tool and you know if you can read that this tool creates a QuickTime movie from a sequence of images bla bla bla gives you a bunch information all sorts of thing you can do what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go to the finder and I'm gonna find this output folder and I'm going to drag this output folder right here and then I'm gonna look here and say like ok my it's it's it's giving me a default height of 640 by 480 but I want to change that because my processing window itself was 640 by 360 what's the frame rate that I want oh and I guess I could have clicked same size as originals in which case it would just use the size of the file and then I can pick whether I want to have some sort of compression I'm gonna pick animation which basically means no compression so I'm gonna get a very big file but I'll be able to bring it in to some other software again if I'm using this in aftereffects it's gonna need to be recompressed later so I don't want to compress multiple times so I could also bring in a sound file if I wanted to include some sound with it I'm not going to worry about that and I'm going to hit create movie and it wants me to save it somewhere I'm gonna put it on the desktop as test movie move and hit save and did that already happen did it just like do it so fast normally shows a little progress window but maybe I just had so little a test movie move I'm gonna open this up come on quick time and yep okay so it just happened so fast you can see it there it is so now I have a movie file that I can save Wow amazingly if it was longer you would have probably seen a little progress bar for it rendering it and you can see this is just a QuickTime movie that I'm playing fantastic so that's the basic gist of it in six minutes I kind of showed you the main piece but I think we could do a little bit more here because you might be in a situation where you want to start and stop the rendering to a file you might want to be able to see some information on the screen whether it's rendering or not so I'm just gonna add a couple more pieces of this program just to make it a little bit more sophisticated okay so so one thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a boolean variable called recording and I'm going to assume that we're not recording when the program first starts so boolean recording equals false so and then I'm gonna say if recording this is where I should save those frames so the other thing I want to do by the way now that I finished and made that movie maybe you need backups and stuff but I'm just gonna go and delete that folder because I don't want to save the previous I don't need to save those previous RAW files I have everything that I need right here in QuickTime now and I will just save that the the movie file again so now only if only if the boolean variable recording is set to true will it actually save those frames that's a useful thing now what I'm going to do is say let's say what I want to do is have a way okay so if I say you know this isn't that interesting let's use key pressed so if I could say if key equals R or key equals capital R recording equals not recording so what this is going to do is when I'm in JavaScript land a rope function void what this is going to do is it's going to say anytime I press R on the keyboard it will start recording or recording it's gonna toggle the boolean state of recording if we're not true is false not false is true so recording equals not itself if it's false become true if it's true become false so that's gonna happen there anytime I toggle it and you can see like if I run this program and I go to the files we can see that it's not recording if I hit if I click in here and I hit R you can see suddenly new files are appearing if I hit R again those new files will have stopped so simply by adding a quick little something to the program I can kind of turn on and off the recording now also what would be nice here is for me be able to see some visual indication on the screen as to whether it's recording or not so what if I just right here I say okay Phil red otherwise Phil green and draw a circle I don't know at the middle of the screen towards the bottom that's like a circle so if we run this you can see there's a little green this is like terrible visual design but there's a little green circle there when it's not recording and when I hit record that circle turns red when I hit record again that circle turns green I don't know if those are the right colors the right visual indicators you want but you get the idea I can toggle the color of that circle and know whether I'm recording or not very useful but but are you thinking in your mind oh no there's a big problem I don't want a big ugly green or red circle in my video but one thing that's wonderful about the save frame function is it's going to save the current view of the processing window and guess what the circle is drawn after I call save frame so save frames gonna save what's in the window and then draw the circle on top of that that circle won't get saved to the file so we should be able to see if I go back to here and delete that I'm gonna run this and I want to start recording for a little bit it's recording it's recording it's recording recording I want to stop recording and then to close here I'm gonna go and look let's just look at these files no green or red circle so we've done it we're able to add a little visual indicator into our window as to whether it's recording or not I think that's the gist of it I try so let's just like show something sort of nice that we can do here which is that if I were to run this at 1920 by 1080 like super highresolution and I'm gonna I'm just gonna put print line a frame rate in here so I'm gonna run this you can see that processing is not able to render the game of life it's might be hard for you see this in this sort of like captured video tutorial but it's not able to run this super fast at such high resolution and it's actually quite fast you could see the frame rate is about 14 frames per second but I want to make this glorious game of life simulation that runs at 30 frames per second so now if I do this and I hit record you can see by the way it's slowing down also why recording because there is if there's some energy and computation and time that it takes to render these to a file if I run this now run this to render this to a file and I stop recording and I skip out of the program and I go back to tools movie maker and I whoops go up here and I get this output folder and I drag it into here it's the same folder now this needs to be 1920 by 1080 and of course I could just select the same size as originals framerate create movie and I want to do test movie night 1080 and hit save and you can see now you're seeing the little progress window is just not doing it as fast this time it's creating the movie and then it's finished and I'm gonna go to the desktop to look at what I've rendered and test movie 1080 I'm gonna open this up converting so that QuickTime can render it come on QuickTime okay there we go I'm gonna make this fullscreen and then play it you can see I've got my 30 frames per second game of life simulation all programmed in processing so I don't know what just happened some old files in there so it like rendered at the end that so it stitched two together it's stitched like the highresolution one with the low resolution one together that's kind of interesting so anyway you can see all sorts of possibilities I hope that this helps you with things that you might be making a processing you can do this with 3d you could do this with just about anything and let me know how it goes for you so thanks for watching this video and I will be back soon with more videos and okay chat okay boy there's a lot of discussion in the chat Oh Java ya p5.js and javascript yeah and people are answering the questions okay so I don't know if anyone's still here live dashboard I can usually see wow there's quite a few people still here so I think this ends my time for today I did two quick video lessons about two random topics I don't know how far into the universe whatever I say now will make it but I'm probably not gonna be making too many more videos until March unfortunately I might do a couple the last week of February but starting in March the week of March 7th or 4th something like the second week of March I will be doing hopefully video lessons twice streams twice a week two to three hours each time with lots more content so stay tuned I'm gonna do that in March and in April and in May and in June I only have I don't very little travel then I'm gonna be doing it a lot so hoping to expand the audience and make more stuff and I'm always looking for suggestions and ideas and comments and feedback so let me know you have one or two minutes to ask question to the chat before I turn this thing off and I will look here just check a couple things I don't see anything super crazy check if the chat is going on more comments below you're welcome everybody okay so I don't see any questions in the chat so I'm going to assume this is good for today I have been doing this for only an hour and six minutes somehow I thought it was much longer maybe I should do one more topic look at my list that's all I was already doing this for two hours processing an eclipse oh yeah Oh instance mode in p5.js people have been asking me about that and I'm a little afraid to do that well I think I'm probably actually I'm gonna move on today very tempting but because I don't have that much time anyway so okay so thanks everybody I'm gonna turn this off in a second this whole thing will get archived it has about a half an hour of fail at the beginning where I was trying to fix the audio and then that's that's that so yeah okay so I'm going to turn this off I will be back soon sometime very soon I hope and thanks for listening trouble somebody wants to know how to work with the database these are all good questions yeah you know what you see I was about to make all these videos about parse calm and parse calm decided to close its doors I think was bought by somebody like Facebook or something like that I was thinking of you doing MongoDB labs database as service so this is something I'm gonna look into and do some videos about in the future okay thanks everybody and I'm gonna sign off and I will see you at the next live stream its lots more coming soon but the month of February is a bit tricky for me but I hope to do more and please be in touch okay goodbye everyone I'll still look at the chat even trouble pressing this button to say goodbye okay you're having to do it
