hello this is me again trying to make a workflow video i've made a bunch of them but i always get lots of questions that are always problems with them so i am now going to make a video that describes my entire workflow even though i have pieces of this in other videos i'm going to do it all in this video you could be watching this video as the as you're just starting to learn to program this isn't the most beginner friendly way to just type your first line of code because i'm going to have a bunch of steps but at some point i will also come back and show you some other uh what editors that you can kind of be up and running uh immediately with so how and by workflow i want to say i want to make a p5.js sketch i don't want to do it in a i mean you you might want to do this i want to do this also but at the moment i don't i want to do this locally on my computer this laptop thing without a cloudbased editor so let me talk about the pieces of the puzzle that i need one thing that you absolutely need oh look at that beautiful is project files now to make a p5.js sketch or really any javascript program web page thing actually all you need is an html file you can write everything you can write all your javascript and everything in there but that's not so convenient it's kind of nicer to just have the html stuff that you need in there um and you need a sketch.js file so you need these project files we could just make these from scratch and type what we need into them but generally we want to get like some sort of template from somewhere so that's one thing we need another thing we need we need a text editor we need something that we can open up these files and by the way we could have more files and project files and css files and image files video files but at a bare minimum this is what we want we need something where we can edit those files you know you could use just about anything use textedit or notepad or anything really i tend to use something called the atom editor uh it is an open source text editor i think put out by github there's also a text editor called sublime text which is quite wonderful there's a free version but it's also a commercial software that you can pay for um there's there's like visual studio people tell me they love and then the list goes on there's lots of them everybody has their own favorite text editor you can say which one is yours in the comments so we need this and then the third thing we need is a server so here's the thing these are the files this is how we write our code in the files how do we what we ultimately want to do is see the result in a web page and it is true that if you just on any computer doubleclick index.html file it will like pop up and open it in the browser but what you might end up seeing is that it's opening it with this path in the address bar file colon slash and what we want to do is open it with this path http colon slash slash basically we want to make sure that um we are simulating the actual realworld way that someone on the internet would view this webpage which is they would view it served up on a web server so we want to run a little web server on our local computer to be able to look at it in the browser and there are lots of options for that i could run a node server what's node oh my goodness ah i could run a python server what's python oh my goodness i could use like an atom server package right there's all these different possibilities so and i forgot to mention there's lots of ways you could get your project files you could just have a friend of that here so you can say hey do you have any p5 schedules can you email me one and then you can just edit that you just copy paste copy paste like 100 times you have 100 project folders i'm going to use a tool called p5 manager it's a little bit of overkill right now because it might be easier just to say hey just download and i'll put a link in this video's description to a zip file where you can just download a blank p5 sketch but i'm going to use this tool called p5 manager which has a little command line thing you can type and it generates the project files for you so i'm going to use p5 manager to generate the project files i'm going to use a text editor to open the project files i'm then going to type my code into the project files i'm going to run a local server and then look at the beauty that is my results does that make sense again i'm trying to make the workflow video to end all workflow that it covers all the pieces i mean there's so much more but this is kind of what i use and i know by the way there's lots of online editors and codepen and glitch and there's a new one coming out from p5.js soon so there's so many possibilities but this is this is a way of working just one just one all right so now here we go how do i how do i use this p5 manager thing well first of all you have to be a little if you're on a mac uh you've got to feel a little comfortable using terminal if you're on windows somebody in the chat tell me what you do on windows so you've got to run this piece of software called terminal it's usually in applications utilities and it looks something like this then you could just magically type p5 generate dash be my project no no you can't so here's the thing this is the command that i type what this command's meet means is hey generate a p5 project i want it to be a bundle i can talk about what that is and i want it to be called my project the thing is i'm gonna i'm gonna just pretend there's something called uh x5 you're gonna see this x5 p5 command not found when i do this it's actually going to work whoops ignore that p5 generate dash b my project this is actually going to work when i do it because i've installed p5 manager already and you can see what this did it created a folder called my project and it gave me sketch.js index.html and by the way i kind of forgot something important now i'm realizing is i also need all those library files you actually don't need the library files locally because index.html can like point out to a url to get the p5 libraries and you'll see that in a lot of uh examples and things but i but the p5 manager will actually give you those library files locally all right here we go now okay so how are you gonna how do you install this p5 manager one thing is i do have a video where i go through how to install this in more detail but i'm gonna do it here anyway but you can i'll link to that p5 manager video as well so the thing that i need is a piece of software called node and node is a javascript runtime built on chrome v8 javascript engine blah blah blah blah it's a thing that lets you run javascript programs on your computer and on servers and lots of other places so you're going to want to download this and install it and you'll know that it's working one of the things you can type by the way in terminal is clear then it'll clear everything you'll know that it's working if you just type node and you get that there so pause this video install node go back to your terminal type in node see if you get this and you can do things like five plus seven and it gives you twelve so you can run a little javascript and i'm gonna hit ctrl c and to exit again press ctrl c again i'm gonna hit clear so once you have node installed you need to use something called npm you've already got it installed and to install the p5 manager you have to say npm install p5 manager now here's the thing you also want to say dash g what this means is i want to install this thing called p5 manager as a global thing for my computer i want to be able to always type p5 manager wherever i am i'm going to hit enter it might have a problem it might i've already installed it but i'm going to let it kind of go anyway and i got an error so here's the problem i forgot that in order to install something globally on my computer i have to say sudo okay what am i doing by the way the up arrow the up arrow allows you to scroll through previous commands so i can go back and find this command and i'm going to now say sudo which stands for super user do which will give me the permission to install it i'd have to type in my password i don't know what my password is there we go right now i think i'm not having like i did the same shtick in a different video so it's installed so that's great i'm gonna hit clear and now i can so here's the thing i can now use that p5 command and look it's telling me i'm running p5 manager 0.3.2 i don't know why the color became all weird here i like selected something i don't know what's going on but i'm going to just pretend that's not happening now here's the thing where do i want to make my project well let's say i just want to put the project on the desktop here's a command that's useful for you pwd print working directory and you can see this is the director i'm in user slash processing my username is processing on this particular login should probably be coding train or whatever but now i can say cd for change directory like maybe i just want to go to the desktop so now if i say pwd here we go and guess what let's say i actually want to go to some weird folder on my computer if i go and say like oh there's this like coding train folder as frogger2 and i want to put something in there i can actually just drag the folder into here let go and that's the whole path users processing documents old desktop pcd coding train frogger2 so i don't need anything to do that right now and hit control c and i'm just going to say clear i'm going to say pwd i'm on the desktop and now i'm going to say p5 generate dash b b stands for bundle p5 will actually generate you this whole like file system management for a lot the p5 manager for a lot of different sketches i personally just like to generate one sketch at a time so that's what dash b does dash b um coding train one so here we go hit enter it created all those things and now just to be sure i'm gonna minimize all my windows and look at this on my desktop is this folder called codingtrain1 and it now has index.html sketch.js and all the library files that i need step one is done again just one way to do that you just need these files you can make them from scratch you can download them somewhere you can copy them from a previous project but step one is done using p5 manager now i need step two so again so many different possible text editors let's use the adam editor so the atom software is a piece of software you can get by going to atom.io and you can do download for whatever your operating system is here you can see this is kind of what it looks like it is a text editor hooray i already have adam installed so i'm going to go down here and uh i'm just going to use the search bar to type in adam so i'm going to run the adam application open it and you can see it's just opening this blank page you'll probably see some like welcome messages and stuff but i've used it quite a few times so it's just opening something blank and then i can do file open i can go to the desktop and i can just select this coding train folder and i can press open and then boom we can see here in the left pane these are my files and this is blank and i can click on sketch and i have the code ready to go so if i add something like background zero and let's make it uh like a green color just to be sure this is working all right i've added some code now i am going to do what i'm going to just i'm going to throw caution to the wind and i'm going to don't do this don't try this at home doubleclick this index.html file and it worked so this is okay it's it's a very bad habit please please please oh it's making me so uncomfortable and it's all green and bright but you can see here this is what i'm trying to avoid it opened the html page via the file system and while just drawing a green background it had no problem with that there are many other areas where you can have a problem so what i really want to do is run a local server now we're now done with step two so now i need to go to step three what local server should i run i have a video i made a long time ago or i ran a python server i think i used a node server and another one i think i might have used the atom live server package i don't know which to use ah you know what the p5 manager comes with its own server in fact i think i'll just show you a bunch so so one thing i can do i got to open terminal back up one thing i can do is first of all i want to be in the directory of my sketch or in a directory above actually it would be fine let's just run the i don't know let's change into the directory i'm going to do this i'm going to hit clear again so i could type some commands to run a local server for example this is a command if you have python installed on your computer which a mac will and i'm probably easy to download install python and a pc that is now running a local server and if i go to the browser and type in localhost colon8000 localhost meaning like i want to connect to google.com or yahoo.com but instead of that web server somewhere off in the internet i want to connect to localhost the web server running on this laptop right here and 8000 is a port so when you connect to a web page it's usually on the default port 80 and you don't specify it but this local server it told me right here it's running it on port 8000 so that's why i knew to type 8000. there is another node package i could install uh sudo npm install g http server i think that's what it's called dot server dash server so i could install this node package i already probably did and then i could say http server and now it's running a server there it is 8080. there it is it's running a server 8080 and you can see this is my local ip address so now i could take go there and put this and i'm running the sketch oh so many things another thing that i could do is a lot of these text editors will come with a special plugin or by default of a menu option which says like preview run live server that type of thing brackets is one that i did a previous video on that has a little button that you press which is for a live preview and it runs a server so adam one of the things you could do with adam is you can under here there's packages now you'll see i already have dev lot no no actually i don't have it so i don't have so this is perfect so what i'm going to do is i'm going to see can i install a live server package with adam so packages oh so adam i want to go to uh preferences you start if you see what i'm doing i'm going to preferences and then i want to go to install which is right here install and then i want to look for i'm going to search for live server dev live reload oh maybe that's what oh no adam so this is something that i've installed dev live reload maybe that does the trick too adam live server is what i was thinking of so i'm going to click install okay it installed because i know that because now it says uninstall or disable uh packages now i have i have that installed i can just go to atom live server start server there are keyboard shortcuts to automatically launch it but i'm going to launch it here and boom there it is and there there's another local server at this address and that port and what's interesting about this now is look at the green color i'm just going to go to my code and i'm going to add this color i'm going to hit save and then i'm going to alt tab to the browser it's live reload so as i change the code like okay well actually i just wanted a 600 by 400 canvas and i want to have like a random something i don't know you can see it's continuously reloading the page for me which is wonderful so okay to recap all the pieces that i'm using are i'm getting my project files from p5 manager which is a node module so i need to download and install node so i can write some terminal commands with node i am using a text editor i happen to be using atom but any text editor will do then i want to view the results of my code in the web browser so i need to run a server now someday you might watch a video where i explain how to program your own server for all sorts of interesting things and i'll link to those videos as well you can write your own node server but you can use a builtin node server you can use a builtin python server if you have python you could look for a plugin for your text editor i'm sure the comments of this video will be filled with lots of other suggestions of how to run your own server so here's something really important something that you might notice in a lot of my examples is i have this other pane open in the browser where i can see error messages or i can do console log statements and the way i'm doing that in chrome it's different in different browsers it's under view developer javascript console so if i click that the javascript console it now pops up over here and you can see adam is even talking to it because it's saying hey i've got the live reload enabled so one thing the couple important points about this number one is it might not appear there for you it might be on the bottom you can pop it out you can kind of control where it goes you can you can look right here and you can see oh i could put it on the bottom or i could pop it out so that's one important thing another really key thing and depending on what the server using is but i like to keep something checked if i go here under settings and i scroll all the way down to network this is a pretty important setting disable cache while dev tools are open this is a setting you want to have checked because sometimes browsers they really like to remember something like say you know what uh you're asking me to do something i already you asked me to do this a while ago i'm just going to do it you asked me a while ago because it's faster but if you're changing your if you're changing your code a lot you don't want it to by accident run your old code so this will disable its ability from caching some previous version of your code and running that instead whenever these javascript console is open so if you have that set you will never have that problem and i can just go and i wasn't having that problem because the live reload is probably you know i can change all these colors and it's it's changing my code but that's an important sort of detail there other question that i'm sure a lot of you are asking is if you're using windows what do you use but as the equivalent of this terminal application so there is just the command prop on windows there are also some i'm reading the chat here some things that you can install like cygwin uh cygwin there are some other tools like you can install the linux file system maybe in windows 10 it actually does this for you i have no idea i'm lost so if somebody writes a helpful comment about the what to do for your terminal and windows i will pin that comment uh to the top of this video's page so maybe look for there and see if that's there the chat is telling me that git bash is also an excellent tool for windows it's actually one that i've used before so you can download something called git bash i will include a link to that as well in this video's description all right i think i've covered everything just to just to like i think i feel like i should do a whole video just on the console alone but so maybe i'll do that but just to like at least put something in there i can do stuff like console.log you know mousex if i put that into my code what i'm gonna see is i'm gonna be able to debug the value of the mouse as i'm running it and if i have some kind of error like i misspell background and don't put the d on the end you can see uncaught reference error background is not defined so this is where i say sketch.js line number six so i can go back and see uh line number six that's where my error is so that javascript console is really a useful tool to get used to using and practice using so i hope this video didn't end up being super long and i hope that you found it helpful and i'm sure i'll end up remaking this again because workflows and tools and technologies just change constantly and thanks very much for watching you
