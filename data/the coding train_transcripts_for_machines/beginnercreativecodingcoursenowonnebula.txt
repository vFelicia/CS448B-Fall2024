this is Dan from the coding trade but I'm just here with my phone because I'm so excited to tell you about something I'm rebooting my original learn to code series on YouTube that I recorded over 10 years ago with processing for it's taken me about eight months to finish it's five hours long and you can watch it on nebula nebula is a wonderful streaming service built by independent creators basically everybody they like to watch on YouTube is on nebula there are nebula Originals there are nebula classes I made one all about programming with the Apple II plus things that are exclusive only to the nebula platform itself this won't be exclusive it's going to be on YouTube soon enough but if you want to watch it right now it's a nebula first and there's a special promotion for September where you can actually sign up for a lifetime subscription to nebula if you sign up through my code it'll support me and it will also go to improving the platform as well as funding many more originals just thanks for watching and supporting however you are just being on the internet and sharing the space with me is wonderful
