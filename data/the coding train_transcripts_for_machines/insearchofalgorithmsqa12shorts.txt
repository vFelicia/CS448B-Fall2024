hi I'm Dan from The Cutting train and I'll be answering your questions today this is the Arcane algorithm archive which is organized by James sloth floodfill I have a song about flood fill it's flood fill time computers domain coloring looks like something that I could maybe attempt at some point ooh that's a pretty image complex yes this looks like something that could be a coding challenge but of course you could watch James's video on it from the Leos Labs YouTube channel if you want to learn more about some of the sources I've used I might suggest that creative code page which is curated by taru muhonen and Rafael De Corville look at all these algorithms all the different noises domain warping was that in the pocket handbook many of these I've done but quite a few of them I have not what am I missing here what are some resources that I'm not thinking of I'm sure if you're watching this you have a way of finding algorithms or things you would like me to tackle in a future video so definitely let me know in the comments and I can address it in less than a minute or in a 700 hour coding Challenge video
