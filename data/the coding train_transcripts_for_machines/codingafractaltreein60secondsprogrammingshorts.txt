want to try and experiment can I boil down one of my full coding Challenge videos into one minute I'm gonna take it easy on myself and start with the recursive tree which was only about a 15 minute video in the first place step number one start with a blank canvas set a line color and a stroke weight translate to the bottom middle of the canvas which is where the tree will grow from then write a function draw a branch which is just a single vertical line with the magic of recursion the branch function can call itself shrinking the length of the next time but this would end up in an infinite Loop so we better have an exit condition to stop drawing when the branch gets too short then we can add an angle translate to the end of the branch to draw the next one then we can rotate off to the right by some angle we can also recursively rotate off to the left throw a little push and pop in there so that each time we draw a branch we're starting from the right position there we go a fractal Tree in p5.js you can watch the full video for a much longer explanation the coded train passenger showcase is full of your beautiful recursive trees you're watching this right now add your own
