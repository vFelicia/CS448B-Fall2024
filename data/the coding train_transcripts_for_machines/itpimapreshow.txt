thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign check one two this is my audio test if you can hear me let me know in the chat and enjoy seeing where everyone is from most recently we've got Catalonia Swedish and outer space all right I'm using this mic again and we'll be starting up in just a couple minutes thank you thank you foreign thank you foreign well I didn't realize that was going to happen I haven't used this setup in a little while I'm hoping you can all hear me as well as the music which is about to fade away in five four three two one and we're live I mean I already was live but now I'm really here and I'm looking at myself in my screen that's in front of me and looking at the camera lens and saying hello to all of you it's been a while uh the traditional greeting of course on the coding train is a train whistle I'm gonna just take a peek over in the chat that says now I hear you we see you okay um so I'm assuming it's all working I see ITP is in the chat saying choo choo the catchphrase of the coding Train choo choo so let me just stay right from the outright um this isn't your usual I don't I don't first of all I don't know what your usual coding train stream would be but whatever in your mind you think of as the usual coding train stream uh it is not what is happening today because today is a celebration of the end of the Academic Year here in New York City I'm not actually in New York City right now but I will be there tomorrow um I'm broadcasting from the outer skirts the country uh life The Wind and The Greenery is blowing the the wind is blowing The Greenery outside I don't know what I'm saying uh today is the ITP IMA uh spring show and if you've followed the coding train for you know what is now amounting to many many years I don't know if we've really gotten into double digits yet but um I would often do a live stream from the show itself and today is a little bit different I am doing a live stream from my studio my home studio and then I will be passing the mic I will be sending you all right into Brooklyn downtown Brooklyn New York to see the wonder that is the ITP IMA show and if you don't know what that is I will start talking about that with a bit more detail in a moment I'm seeing from the chat that we've got Japan Ireland Africa Tunisia this to me I know I say this often this is what I love about getting to do this Channel on YouTube is to be able to connect with and broadcast beam out right here from a garage in the Hudson Valley of New York all over the world to talk about creative coding and all the things the magical fun wonderful things you can do with code whether you are a beginner and this is your first time ever thinking about code or thinking about writing a line of code or watching the coding train or you've been here all along for however many years this train has been in service um it's been a little bit out of service this semester just I I do want to use this time to give you some updates about things that are happening in the coding train and particular about the nature of code book which is something I am actively working on we've got now Dominican Republic Syria Czech Republic Denmark and Korea uh out of that list I've only ever been to Denmark so I've definitely got to expand my world travel um all right so um this is also can be as much or little of an interactive stream as you like I'm keeping whenever I look over this way I am looking at the chat and if I catch a question there um you can I'll try to answer it as well as there are a few coding train moderators who are in the chat who can take a question and place it over here into the coding train member Discord so if you want access to that member Discord you can also join the coding train Channel but that's not what today is about I want to talk to you about ITP and Ima so um let me switch over here let's see if this button Works Cuba Netherlands Italy uh Basque Country okay I'm gonna press this I'm a little out of practice here so let's see um what's going on I can't find the button left here it is there we go okay I've made myself a little bit smaller I'm realizing I really need to go for a beard trim um and I've got the uh my browser opened up here okay so um you might know me from the coding train a YouTube channel where I uh live inside a little rectangle and awkwardly try to communicate with the rest of the world but most of my time is in fact spent at a teaching at a program at New York University uh there is a twoyear graduate program called ITP stands for interactive telecommunications program there is a fouryear undergraduate BFA IMA interactive media arts there is also a low Residency program which is a oneyear Master's which can be done mostly remote with a few inperson intensive intensives hopefully I'm getting this somewhat right and that is called the IMA lowres program so if any of those programs are of interest to you I would suggest heading on over to itp.nyu.edu and there's all sorts of more more and more all sorts of information there ah we see I see it now you've got ITP IMA which is undergraduate and then the IMA low Residency program oh there's also this thing called ITP Camp which I am really hoping to participate in this year we'll see if I can make that happen but this is a fourweek creative and Cooperative playground playground which is all happening in June so that's coming right up I think you can even still apply to participate in ITP Camp so why don't you use ARC as your default browser yeah that's a good question maybe I should I I accept your criticisms of my use of Google Chrome I use it frankly out of convenience uh oh wait a second here I'm like oh I have the okay I'm like why is my shirt red so okay so I know I know I just went off on a tangent welcome to the coding train where I talk about both uh trigonometric functions like sine cosine and tangent but mostly just go off on tangents all right um uh with love from Saturn okay so I have a new setup where I'm using a confidence monitor with this like reflective glass teleprompter setup So in theory if I wanted to use a teleprompter I could I clearly am not using a teleprompter right now otherwise it would make more sense and one of the things I turned on is like this setting that shows me if any of the pixels are peaking I think like the like my white balance or brightness those of you who are video people know what I'm talking about and my whole shirt has turned red uh which is what I'm seeing in the confidence minor but I look over here to see what's being broadcast to YouTube it still looks normal all right uh um all right so where was I yes talking about ITB so first of all it is about 1pm eastern time and if you happen to be in the New York City area you should just turn this off right now and head on over to 370 J Street uh which is in downtown Brooklyn all the Subways go there to go to the show in person let's switch on over to the show website which I can find at itp.nyu.edu show um so here you'll see the information about the actual inperson show today it's starting at 2PM so this is just me talking for about another hour and you know maybe I'll do a quick coding demo or something if we have time or if there's a topic that comes up um default Focus confirmation is what Andrew Dennis is telling me and thank you for your nice comment souvik um so um um today and tomorrow so you can if you can come in person um however don't just show up you need for in terms of the security system that way it works at NYU you'll need to go through and claim your tickets it's free but you need to make sure you enter the name and email address of each attendee um so I will be there tomorrow in person um and I'm not there in person today I'm doing this preshow all right so this is the information about the show now it looks like if I click over here I can see the show map wow what is this going to take where is this going to take me it's taking me to figma all right this is this is much to uh this is much too advanced for me right now but we can see the floor and where all the projects are ooh I wonder if we can look at some of the projects that's what that's one thing we could do during today's live stream uh previous shows show map projects let's go over here ah so now we're seeing all of the projects wonderful um one of the things I might do is look at the various projects that are part of uh the nature of code which is a course that I taught this semester and is a project a now I mean a well over 10year project um that is really bothering me that my shirt is red as I look I should probably turn that setting off but there's nothing I can do about it um so uh I want to talk about the nature field let me make a list of things so I want to update you on coding train schedule and summer um and I want to update you on nature of code and then I want to review some ITP projects and we are on a time crunch here this stream will promptly shut down in about an hour and if YouTube's live redirect feature works it will send you right over to the actual ITP live stream um oops no that's not what I was going to move it if you look at this video's description there should be a link to the ITP live stream which is a separate YouTube event on a separate Channel what's figma I am not qualified to answer that question somebody in the chat feel free to answer what is figma I will take your questions about processing P5 creative code the coding train nature of code all that stuff which you can ask in the chat all right uh thank you Ellery chainan for answering that question about figma all right what do I want to look at first all right let's just let's Dive Right In and I'll take questions as we go but let me give you some updates about the coding train itself so uh if you I haven't done a live stream probably I think I did the the last one was the January uh speed run I can't remember if I covered this at all but if you haven't taken the time to look at the new coding Train website now is a wonderful opportunity for you to do so I will soon be releasing about a five minute video about the new coding Train website um but just to cover it a little bit right now here it is uh thank you to the wonderful Folks at DSi Design Systems International who designed this site uh thank you to the tremendous efforts of the coding train Community um to name just a few who have been very active recently uh Kathy depalm and Francis who have been doing a tremendous amount of work fixing bugs and expanding the content of the channel uh the website that is also a shout out to um Klein who is an IMA student who built this overall structure for uh this showcase page which I want to come and look at in a bit more detail in a minute so um what uh this is where you can find the archive of the history of the coding train not every single video that's on the channel is on the website if there is a video that's on the channel That should be on the website uh please um there is a wonderful process by which you can contribute but what do I mean why does a video have a page on the website well if I go to what is the more a popular series from the coding train like the challenges you'll see that every challenge I think there might be one missing still coding Challenge number 40. every challenge has its own page here if I were to pick one I'm actually just going to pick this one that's featured right now the 3D terrain and go to it the reason for this is there is a lot I'm just amused by the thumbnail um there's a lot of metadata associated with each and every video that is not easily covered by the YouTube interface and so if you are looking for the code example it's right here uh description other references other related videos credits for the video as well as projects this is now the passenger showcase for this which are all the projects that other folks have made some of these are just so lovely um and they're I think they're in a random Order each time so if we refresh the page yet you can see they're in a random Order each time as well as some other related challenges of related topics so this is my attempt along with DSI and the larger coding train Community to you know I have over a thousand videos on the channel and so to have a kind of OneStop shopping place where you can find the videos as well as all of the metadata and and code that goes along with those videos so and dpom um in the member chat as you put wrote new with giant quotes around it because uh yeah the website that I don't know how new it is anymore it's new to me ah lovely a72 is saying I am coming to Tish this year well I hope to get to meet you in person please stop by the fourth floor uh that's where I am um and so you know just just to look I just want to go back to the challenges page for a second oh actually no no let me pause pause time out and just let me go to the track space so I'm showing you these are the challenges which are videos which are essentially a single project made in a particular video um if I go to the tracks page this is where I am cataloging videos that exist as a sequence well as a let's let's just use the word collection so a track you can think of it as a sequence and some of them are the main tracks which are written right here our sequences so if for some reason you just came out of nowhere and are watching me right now on the internet and wondering boy I wish I could just start from the total beginning I've never coded before and I want to learn that is what this main track code programming with P5 would be you can click into here all the videos um all the videos are here if I go to any given one very old thumbnail the code is here as well as you know showcase projects that people have made so this would be your playlist your track your collection your sequence your course whatever you want to call it for learning to code with P5 um there are other ones uh sort of this one deals with node and working with apis a little bit about git and GitHub so machine learning nature of code I'm going to come talk about more but there are also these Side Tracks which are loose collections of videos so if you ever wanted to learn about super shapes all of the super shape videos are right here ah this polar coordinates is not explicitly a super shape video but it is a necessary math that comes up in the Super ellipse uh this uh and all of these other particular videos along with the mandelbub is in here okay great and then if I uh backtrack here we can see there's some games algorithmic botany et cetera et cetera et cetera okay so that is the uh that's pretty much the website um there are lots of other things here like these guides if you want to like learn about submitting to the Showcase or helping maintain the website getting started is there um I forgot to I did forget to say Happy Mother's Day happy Mother's Day um and that okay so what did I want to show next here right my mind was going somewhere well let's look at some showcase projects because there's been some new ones first of all it seems that we have a showcase project from Kai who is nine years old so first let's everybody round of applause see if this works a round of applause for taking me way too long to figure out if my soundboard still works and of course it didn't work you know what my I'm using this software called loopback and it's right now causing me all sorts of issues there we go all right there's the Applause thank you it's not for me it's for Kai uh so Kai created this project called cave generation with Perla noise based off of the 10 print video let's take a look at this oh cool ah I see so what I I'm kind of guessing here because I didn't make this or I haven't looked at the code but what this to me looks like is um oh and Sesame Street gang is asking what's ITP I made so I did cover that a little bit already but I will come back to that um looks like here 10 print is a particular Graphics pattern that emerges this mazelike pattern when you randomly draw a line diagonally in one of two directions like think of an X pick randomly whether you're drawing this line from the X or this line over a grid so it looks like what Kai has done here is instead of drawing a line has drawn a square with two different colors and I it's called I'm again I'm speculating but uh it's called cave generation because through Randomness you end up getting these pockets of empty uh like like the lighter spots to me or like empty spaces inside the cave where you could walk around and the darker spots of the walls of the game now but I don't think this is pure Randomness because it looks like there is a bit of smooth uniform quality here which is probably coming from purlin noise and if you don't know what pearling noise is oh boy do I have news for you remember that whole thing about the tracks that I was showing on the website got a whole track all about what is Pearl and noise let's take a look at Kai's code see if I'm my speculation was at all correct and we can see here there are functions for drawing the backslash and forward slash which instead of a line is a rectangle and then aha exactly and the some kind of calculation related to purlin noise this is very interesting here the input into the noise is this mathematical equation based on the X Y location and then checking it against another call to noise that's super interesting way I have to think it's going to take me some time for my brain to unpack like what the quality of of uh the coin flipping essentially will come out of this way of comparing noise um but we can look someone is asking like I can now run this in P5 and if we wanted to look at what pure Randomness would look like and I don't know let me log in here as the coding train um so that we can save this and make some modifications so let's look at what it would be with pure Randomness so I can just comment out this if statement and say instead if random 1 is less than 0.5 which would be like the pure Randomness version of it and there you can see now oh interesting it looks like this spacing changed the spacing must oh oh the spacing's random each time okay I'm like why did the spacing change yeah so so some great questions happening in the um chat which is uh yes there's a noise so yeah uh just I don't know if I'm answering the question specifically but there is a function in P5 called noise now the term noise on its own really means Randomness but noise in P the random function uh in P5 is for uniform Randomness and the noise function is for a smooth kind of Randomness referred to as purlin noise and if you want to learn more about this uh we're going to be talking about the nature of code in just a moment so thank you Kai this was fun this is great to see this project um a couple things I might note here Kai's probably not watching right now but um this frame rate this this of of 1000 is uh not something that um will really actually work um this is sort of like the frame rate I like to say that the argument to the frame rate is aspirational it is not actually setting the frame rate to a particular value it is saying like I want you if you can to run at this frame rate so uh in most cases like P5 I think the default frame rate it's going to Aspire to is 60 frames per second so changing it to 30 would make sense because you're saying like hey even if you could run faster don't just stick with 30 but if if there are other elements the speed of your computer or the things happening in the browser the amount of stuff you're drawing in the draw Loop are that like the the frame rate won't actually live up to its assignment and one thing that's interesting about what Kai's done here is this is generating a static image so I might actually suggest putting in draw a call to no Loop because the the this particular sketch just generates a static image there's no reason to draw it over and over again in which case and I'm wondering actually why oh because it's using noise but why is it not so this is interesting why is it not change changing this over and over again is I don't see a call to random seed a little confused here because this should be just curious what happens if I do this ah it's doing them one at a time ah so that makes sense uh there was this idea of animating it and this is kind of cool to see it do it this way and I you know we could I can now change that to 60 just to kind of max out the frame rate you can see it's running a little faster but why oh I think the reason why it wasn't um it it wasn't uh redoing it each time with a new random set of values is because it's moving This Global variable X and Y and once it gets to the end it doesn't reset back so one of the things I could if I wanted to I could say if Y is greater than height I could put this in here if Y is greater than height then now set y also back to zero and what this would do if we can make this run a little bit faster is and let's put it back to doing five thousand of them but let's just do 50. and we can see now it's doing 50 at a time and when it gets to the end it will come back sorry I haven't been keeping track of the chat I'm looking at the Discord uh uh okay as you can see it came back to the top there so just just to put a finer point on this let's make the spacing 30 hardcoded as 30 and let's make this just two and we can see now I've made a new version of Kai's code where when it gets to the bottom it will presumably as we wait because the sound is broken still comes back to the top and starts running over by the way let's just look at it um with the lines I'm curious to see and we'd have to change this to a stroke this is kind of this was not what I meant to do this happened by accident let's take out the rectangles and let's use the ground color for both so this is this is now uh the 10 print pattern so you can see I'm just backing into what the original example was and you can see how Kai now got to this new pattern one by changing the drawing two squares instead of lines whoops and then in addition writing a new algorithm for how the uh spots are picked and we can put the algorithm back in and you can see we get some pretty uh the different results um pyro axo Dragon says never knew you did live streaming yeah well unfortunately it's kind of I'm a little bit I was kind of struggling here because I used to do weekly live streams so the reason why you never knew I did live streaming is because this is only my this is my third live stream of the entire year and it is you know the middle of May so I would like to do more live streams I'm curious about where those artifacts in the pattern are coming from Unchained I wasn't sure I'm not 100 sure about your question because I was doing a lot of different things and may have missed um missed I'm looking at the time 120 I might have missed um the Spy I didn't I didn't catch your question at the moment when I was showing something on the screen so I don't know what it matches up to all right let me move back to the Showcase thank you Kai let's um let's look at um we've got let's look at this one so we've got a showcase project ah right okay so what's one of the things I should get this box hold on it's on my list I I know I just left the I left the camera view we can do a like we could do a little live unboxing today on the channel um so if you uh tuned into the coding train in 20 20 22 I did a bunch of videos with my app a childhood Apple II plus computer and I would like to do more of them um and one of the things I wanted to do um is work with a Commodore 64. now the Apple II plus was a computer that I actually had and saved from my childhood I did have to order some replacement parts and things off of eBay to get it working again but it's pretty much the you know it's for all intents and purposes it's the uh it I like to think of it as my the literal childhood computer that I saved for all these years now I did not have a commodore 64. uh but I did find one off of eBay and I and I purchased it to make videos with it it's still sitting in the box like the ship I don't even want to tell you what the ship date on this is because it'll be much too embarrassing wow well let me just tell you that that the ship date is from 2022. very very late in 2022. so I'm just checking here my notifications oh um perfect okay I'm just looking at information about the ITP stream which is starting in 30 minutes and I actually just got a notification about that all right so uh Brooklyn humanist is starting IMA in a month coming in knowing nothing well guess what and real sickness is in the chat hello Enrique the artifacts came from not clearing the background you answered thank you I know there's other questions that I'm not getting to because I'm just off on a trigonometric tangent once again anyway um Brooklyn humanist great name um a today you will now know about IMA because if you stick around through me chatting a little bit about it and then if you watch the show and if you are in Brooklyn I would say go head over to the show in person anyway there's a Commodore 64 in here you gotta open it up maybe I'll open it up today if we have a little time but I'm going to keep moving um so I would love to click on this but um oh oh look at this they made a video for it this is amazing I had I didn't actually know there was an archive of this okay this is awesome we're gonna watch this how long is it four minutes and 16 seconds this is now this is now coding train reacts we're now I have a new channel it's called coding train reacts where the whole time I go like this I don't I don't react verbally I react with interpretive dance this is so cool I didn't realize there was a um video archive of it things Cody Trenton reacts by liking the video oh no I moved out of the way let me just get this comment in I I should really send the music out through the I don't know why this is not working there you go I don't know what's going on I don't know why it's not working Mike but okay okay fractal three let's skip to the end there fractal four fractal five all right thank you for this so that's really fantastic so you can find that so one of the other things that um nice about the passenger Showcase in case you weren't aware is if you click on a given oh no um how do I do that doesn't work from here oh no no I so we I forgot we didn't implement this I thought if you click on the author's name it'll take you to their all of theirs but I would actually just have to look for it here but if you search for a particular author we can see um that BTM 86 is only submitted uh this one but if I go to um Kathy for example who I know has submitted a lot of showcase projects uh so many beautiful ones we can see all of Kathy's submissions right there um and so yeah look at all these wonderful submissions we see a few different climate spirals came in from the climate spiral coating challenge um and look at all these some wave function collapse some more fractal trees so anyway the hope is here that one this is a way for you to share your work with the community but also for you to get inspired and see what other people are making so I think I'm good in terms of talking about the coding Train website um let's let me move on here for um to some other things because I'm short on time okay I'm gonna close this let me save this cave generation sketch that we were just looking at um all right so I did a stream I believe this was January 1st 2023 and I made this list I kind of went through and um on the left here that I'm standing in front of I went through and cataloged all of the things that I did for the on the coding train in 2022 which made me feel a little bit better because if I hadn't done very much and it was it was a long list and then I made a list of goals for uh 2023 and so thank you to depam who took this white board and put it into a markdown file and so I wanted to take you know maybe just about five minutes now uh because we are I have about a half an hour left before I'm going to send you over to ITP um and look through and see what I've got and what I might want to do next because I did not I was not able to allocate a lot of time to the coding train since the start of 2023 I returned back to teaching fulltime at NYU but it is the summer now and I'd have a less busy in terms of travel and other types of things summer than I have had in the past so I'm hoping to in addition to enjoying the summer and spending time with family and friends which is something I hope you all will do um I hope to be able to catch up on some of these coding train projects as well as although I really should not be allowed to until I finish the nature of code book so I kind of maybe I might make a poll here uh just to sort of but I think what I really should be doing is I got a lot of work done on the nature of code book and my goal is to finish everything by I was I was going to say the end of May but I think the end of June is more realistic I probably shouldn't allow myself to do anything on the coding train until that book is completely 100 finished and published online and in the Publisher's hands for the print version which I will talk about in a bit but let's take some time to look at this list um okay yeah the list was ambitious so I did do a Pi Day coding challenge and um hold on let's look at what's on the channel actually oh and I did a soft body physics coding Challenge and a climate spiral so I do get to uh let's hit edit here and let's give myself some credit for some other things so I did a soft body physics challenge choose toxic Libs um and I did uh Pi Day and then which was buffon's needle and then I also did the climate spiral so I'm going to update that okay great so I have completed three challenges so that's not terrible given that my goal was to have 10 new coding Challenge videos for the year and I realized there was a time in my life where I was doing like three or four coding challenges per week I don't know how I did that sort of a different I had a different process then maybe I should go back to that I don't know but these this is a good list and I think it's a fine list to keep ah but I do want to add one to it so um I want to do the Wolfram Elementary CA so that is another one and if I do and priority wise I kind of like this order right now because I really wanted this this one I really would like to get the second part of wave function collapse done over the summer okay so that's good guests I want to do more with guests I've not made the time and space for it uh nebula so again today's stream is about the ITP show so I don't want to be too um off topic and promoting my own uh kind of coding train work too much but uh in case you're wondering what nebula is if you go to go.nebula.tv codingtrain um you will find my nebula page nebula is a independent Creator owned and maintained streaming service so if you think about uh your Netflix your Hulu your Amazon Prime your Macs nebula is just like any of those services but the content on nebula is um from you know education adjacent uh YouTubers um uh so it's something that you can sign up for to support the coding train I made a a whole uh I'm gonna see if this course on it uh with the Apple II plus computer so but again I don't want to promote this too much right now today I do want to promote it but another time would be more appropriate for that but I don't want to mention that because um I do have opportunities to create content exclusively for nebula and collaborate with nebula they have studio and production team to work on making things of a different quality and a different scope so if you have ideas for things that you think might work with that platform if you're a fan of nebula let me know I'd love to hear from you um but that's what's up that's what's on this list okay Apple II retro computing so I have not done any of these but this is something that I could return to this summer as well I don't know if I want to focus more on the coding challenges but I wanted to do a quick example on the Apple II for how you can play tones music I wanted to look at 6502 Assembly Language maybe more directly and then the four mentioned oh I hurt my back uh Commodore 64 which is in this box right now okay have not gotten to any of those things uh I want to do more live streams that's just on the list in general more nature of code videos uh well the book has to be completed first so this really shouldn't get a check here I'm going to uncheck it um I have recorded it by the way like if you wondered why you might want to join the coding train like I think if I go here under live you're going to see that like in case you don't believe me um where oh what where did these go so strange that they're not actually here did I just do these like longer ago I'm so confused I was expecting to see a million of these like members only streams for the um recording the processing videos and I'm I might just be looking at this in a weird wrong way but they're not there anyway back to the topic at hand which was here is I actually recorded about six hours five five hours ish of a new course about learning to program with processing using processing four the problem is um I haven't effectively been allocated or I just haven't finished all of the editing and postproduction that goes with that so it became a much more complex project than I envisioned and I think when I I want to do the same for p5.js but when I redo those videos um I I think I like having them as separate videos because it's much easier for me to finish and complete a 10 minute video and publish it and put it on YouTube then to put six hours worth of all the material into one video because uh everything has to be done you know before I can upload it so anyway that's coming um in the fall I will be teaching a class at NYU around uh yeah I must have oh maybe they're unlisted but I thought they would show up in my their unlisted not members only that's that motto motto 58 is correct um the Discord bot tutorials are coming this fall you know better late than never I suppose but um this fall I'm teaching a class called programming from A to Z which I should really think about a new name for that class because it sounds like it's a comprehensive beginner programming course but it's uh meant to be a play on words in that it's about programming with text so if you've watched any of my Markov chain or uh contextfree grammar videos um some of the working with API stuff um those are the videos and content that goes with that course and in that course we do experiments making Bots and generating text for Bots I used to do Twitter I did some Mastodon I've been making some blue sky uh bought examples so I haven't I don't know what platform I'm going to use for the class in the fall to sort of see what the landscape is of social media platforms but a Discord bot is one that I'm pretty committed to doing and so I need to remake those videos to go along with the course um so but I'm also planning to do some content around uh language models uh and using Transformers whether I try to use some open source um like there's the wonderful Nano GPT repo that Andre carpathy made I believe if I'm getting that right where I could look at sort of training a Transformer model with my own smaller Text data set I feel quite conflicted around using large language models especially closed ones that you have to pay for on the channel but um I've been experimenting with the Llama which it which is actually an open source language model that meta has released there's of course chat GPT and the chat GPT API that I'm that many of you are probably familiar with so I I I've sort of trying to find where is the line like uh of appropriateness in terms of education and Outreach and empowering others to use these models but being aware of the biases that are involved in the sort of training of them um the harm that is the the sort of risk the safety issues around what these how these models can be used and abused as well as the in particular I'm talking about open AI here the sort of closed nature of the model so I'm still thinking about that if folks have thoughts or advice around how to handle that well in terms of video tutorials I'm all ears and fishy is talking about hugging face yeah hugging face is a wonderful so the two model repositories that have great that that in my eyes right now seem to have really excellent communities and resources around our hugging face and replicate and replicate I um has some nice hooks to train for training anyway I don't I don't want to get into that too much but that's what I've been looking at um okay NOC book we're coming to it is 140. uh other things the whistles were sent out that is done I'm gonna uncheck this because I have not published it this is a little five minute you know how like when you go to a wedding you have a year to give a present I think if you make a new website you have a year to release a video announcing the new website I think I'm still within that window I'm not entirely sure um I really want to work on the uh macro data refinement game that is inspired by the Apple TV show Severance I guess I might say right now that I in solidarity with the writer strike I am not going to work on that until there's a contract okay if you want the world is clamoring for me to continue working on my fan fiction computer program version of an obscure piece of software that's in the scene in an Apple TV Plus show I'm sure that's what's going to break break the break the dam here and get a contract signed to pay writers their fair share anyway I I will come back to that and I am making this summer I've absolutely got I got a put the put up or shut up here um I'm making a p5.js uh Port reboot version of the Oregon Trail original organ Trail game that I looked at and played on the Apple II Plus in a few live streams if you're interested in participating in making this it's it's out there there's a repo I started it just to let it linger slowly dying all right um 136 concurrent viewers light little lights for a Sunday here probably haven't haven't been making videos haven't been streaming by the way the the viewership activity on the channel is like at about 50 right now of what it has been or what it normally had been throughout the throughout 2022 I attribute that to my lack of making videos also um I don't know whether it's my uh whether there's just more competition whether it's my the topic Choice the sort of branding thumbnail title branding but the last two coding Challenge videos did not catch any of the algorithm YouTube algorithm waves that a lot of my code and Challenge videos have in the past um so in case you missed those you know feel free to check them out okay um all right 140. so let's take um I'm looking at my phone here because I've got a back Channel chat with the uh and with the NYU folks let's talk about the nature of code and this is all just good news um okay I mean I could brainstorm other things to add to this list or things that I might want to cut from it but let's let's talk about the nature of code okay so a couple things this semester at NYU I taught a undergraduate and graduate section of the class nature of code now if you're not familiar with what nature of code is I'm going to show you a website that you really should stay away from this is the actual public active nature of code website what is on it is it has a mechanism for you to download the book as a PDF ePub and Kindle you can slide this all the way down to zero and get it for free if you this is also a way for you to support the project if you wanted to if you have the capacity you can also uh um link to Amazon where you can purchase it I keep meaning to add um I've been using um Bookshop more recently which I did find it available on as well so you know support independent booksellers through Bookshop um is another possible way to get the book and then um the book itself is just online here as HTML CSS uh content that you can read for free online so why am I talking about this I started this project I would say probably in 2008 I think that's right someone would have to fact check this when I taught a version of this class um you know a lot of the material came out of other courses that I talked about and that I'd taken as a graduate student myself and other other work that I've written about in the acknowledgment so I want to just make sure I mention that and um you know probably around like five years later like maybe two thousand or even less like 2016 2017 I started thinking about updates to the book based on things that I had learned and thought that I could improve the changing landscape of machine learning and deep learning there's a chapter on neural networks that is you know woefully out of data quite possibly quite irrelevant now um as well as using p5.js for the uh just to make the book easier to interact with and use online so Java applets not being a thing anymore that you can easily run in the browser P5 is a nice choice for the book so uh I've been spinning my wheels for a really long time about updating it slowly a little bit here a little bit there and lots of people have helped me and this is a much longer story but what I want to go to now is I want to look at NOC book well so sorry on GitHub if I go to the nature of code and I realize I'm standing in front of a lot of this let me move this over if I go to the nature of code organization on GitHub you'll find a whole bunch of repositories the existing website the syllabus for the class I just taught but the one that I really want to highlight here is nature of code book 2023 and I just want to validate that I have really been working on this by going to how do I find it um I think I have to click here insights let's just see and let's look uh what do I do like commits maybe would be a good one to look at um and no where's that graph let me just like contributors contributors maybe is what I mean to look at yeah so you can actually slow down because of the end of the semester but what I um there's been a lot of work on the book itself all happening I mean really in the last year so um so what do I mean by work so if I go to um here a couple things there have been um a whole bunch of people you can see them here under contributors um Jason gal most recently doing a ton of this work into building a whole new workflow for publishing the book which involves notion and um you know um and a whole build system to turn the book into a website and if I click over here you will now see uh prototype work in progress version of the new nature of code book and I want to say that basically all of these chapters are somewhere between 80 to 100 completed which is very very good news that's much further along than I have been at any point during this process so if I were to just look at one of them let's pick the vectors one and start to scroll through it uh you'll want to just point out a number of things one is the examples now well the I'm gonna I'm gonna just uh make this smaller so you can see it a bit more what it looks like the examples are embedded in here running in the browser um if I click on any given example it will take me right to the code in the web editor so this is what I'm talking about about the convenience we've got the written text um I want to see here if uh with new illustrations so these are all new illustrations that Zanna Marsh who is a colleague friend uh Alum of the ITP program has been working on um there's some really fun ones that you'll find throughout the book there is new uh math notation so the quality of the math notation that I'm using is much better using I think it's katex is what it's called um so again embedded examples and I can scroll through we can go to a different chapter just to kind of see some more sophisticated this is this is my new one of my new favorite things about the book is uh the target for all the steering examples is a strawberry because Berry so that makes me enormously happy so um so uh but as I get further on the chapters are a little less and less like there's still some work happening in the fractals chapter that needs to be finished um so this chapter is very much in progress here's kind of a fun illustration about factorial you can see the recursion examples so this is all available for you to read and look at online if you want to do so and if you are doing so and you have comments you notice typos mistakes broken examples what I would ask for you to do is file an issue here in the GitHub repository you at present cannot fix content in the book with a pull request even though all the content for the book is here and you could do a pull request to make an edit there I am doing the work of writing in notion database so these HTML files are autogenerated and I'm going to show you right now that process because I just did a lot of work on chapter nine evolutionary Computing but I did not update the website so let's make that happen I'm going to go here to actions I'm going to run so there's this action that if I run this workflow and I'm going to do it right now because it takes a bit of time looking at oh whoa we're almost ready to move into the ITB show this workflow will go and I I don't know if I can easily I'm afraid to open notion right now maybe I'll I will show that at a future time um but this process is now reading the notion API retrieving all of my writing from the notion API as Json and it's converting that Json into um the HTML files it is also if you can believe this and I really can't take any credit for this uh you can look you can look through the uh the people who have worked in the repo and all of this code um in addition it is grabbing any images so all of the figures and images and screenshots that are uploaded into notion come into the repo as well as all of the code so if I put a link to a P5 web editor sketch in notion that web editor URL is gotten via the notion API and then we're using the P5 web editor API to get the code to create the embed that's on the page it's amazing um so if I look at that here we can see this is running the I'm just gonna see if we can get like the logs for it um you can see this is the lodge right now it's this is it just fetching all the notion content um so it's still and um and doing that um and thanks thanks fun Planet uh for putting um everything it and when this is done I really hope it finishes in time for me to show you it will auto generate a pull request which will uh that which I will then merge which will then rebuild and update the website so uh with Gatsby so um it's tremendous amount of work and time has gone into this and uh the reason why I I'm now finally a couple reasons why I'm finally getting this done one is uh thank you to um it some ITB students have been working with with me on this um as well as ITP alums and other volunteers um and teaching being teaching the class this semester kind of focused my energy onto it as well as and I'm excited to report that um I will be working with no starch just go to the to for the print version of the book so you might be asking this question like wait wait wait wait what's going on here the it was the original version of the book which is not here where is that did I close it I must have closed it let's put it here on the nebula page uh and I gotta keep an eye on the time here because I I think the ITP live stream has started but the actual it's just playing a placeholder video It's Gonna I gotta send you guys to there send everybody there too so the original book was selfpublished and this was very important to me um because I wanted to be Creative Commons licensed I wanted to be an open education platform you know it is an ex it was an expensive project for me to produce so the income from you know optional pay what you want online and the print book did help uh uh certainly uh broke even and uh probably over 10 years has now well exceeded whatever I invested into it although I don't know if you count the time uh with what that would mean but um but there were there's a few issues with this one is one of the reasons why I selfpublished it was for that for the open education model um and no starch press is uh I've been uh chatting with them and talking with them is really on board with that so the book itself will still be the new version of the book will still be Creative Commons licensed and available for free online um the print version um print on demand is is a nice in theory and I think there's lots of good applications for it but I have a lot of issues with the quality the print quality of the book people were reporting you can see like right here uh on the website says uh problem with the quality of your print like I had to build a whole thing put a whole thing on the website that was like a separate page for to show like what the page should look like what people were seeing it as so that I could like keep track of this um and like you know kind of complain or try to get them a new version of the book um the company that I used for print on demand was acquired by Amazon so I kind of don't want to use it again because you know we all have to make decisions that work with our lives and I am going to have a book that's sold on Amazon and I do buy things off of Amazon but I don't like the all eggs in one basket I do want to support um all Alternatives and so by working with no starch I can have a higher quality book and I can have it um I can have more ways of Distributing it plus I have the editing support the project management support and they're putting me on a deadline so I have to finish this that's the morally the most important thing so I wanted to just give you those updates about it um if you want to follow along oh good this finish this oh it's it completed the job but I don't see a pull request yet oh it's there so if you want to follow along uh fun Planet posted the links in the chat uh please come and read uh if you want to contribute then come and visit the repository and the easiest the lowest barrier to entry for contributing is like filing an issue and even if you wanted to file an issue that just says like I support you working on this project it's okay that you're not live streaming or making a lot of videos because this project is important if you just want to say that and you're like that's a way of participating in the project but you can also leave comments um you can read through what's kind of outstanding um and that kind of thing okay so this is every print is unique and guaranteed to be one of a kind yeah okay that's nature of code which is a really nice segue uh to move back to what is the primary purpose of today uh which is the ITP IMA spring show so let's look at these projects is there a way to search and filter let's see can I search by Nature oh nature of code oh look at this so now we are now seeing all of the projects from the nature of code course which was my course and uh from the semester and the all of these wonderful students oh I'm so excited to see these projects there might be more that somehow didn't get tagged right but let's let's in the in the in five minutes we're going to send you over to the live stream there where they were actually the students will be walking around with the camera let me just get my chat with NYU going and make sure what is that sound a weird sound just started happening um oh I forgot to show oh there's so many things ah uh let me just find my uh chat here okay we are ready to go live whenever you wrap up they say okay I'm wrapping up um I'm wrapping up give five minutes okay five more minutes okay all right so first of all I kind of forgot just because I was here I forgot to show the sort of cool thing about this which is now it's running the tests so it can't it hasn't preview built it yet but you can now see here um all of the edits that I have made um in the book since the last time the site was published so you can see a lot of like code things that I've done and I actually did a lot of work on the genetic algorithms chapter so if you look here you can see in this pull request all the things that I've been updating and rewriting uh for the nature of code chapter so I just wanted to show that for the for the genetic algorithms chapter and then ah and it finished awesome so now it also built a preview on netlify so if I go here this would be now all the rewrites of the genetic algorithm chapter would be here and I can see already these new tables that I put in I have to fix these um are there and I am going to very excitedly emerge that what I usually do is I try to do uh chapter nine updates and more just change the title uh and I'm going to merge this okay okay so I just wanted to close the loop on that I forgot to mention that part of my nature of code book discussion all right now the Showcase all right so let's look um let's look at one of these uh I'm gonna look at uh uh I I I I'm like I'm like I can't pick I'll just click through all all six of them real fast oh come on that didn't let me ah no okay I feel like this will be a nice ending to this oh I see there's also oh no it got okay uh open why there's some kind of like JavaScript here that's not allowing me to open in a new in a new tab so let's let's let's pick a random number random.org uh let's pick a random number one through six one through six and that's one we'll look at from top one two three four five six all right three okay we're looking at number three which is wait a second here they're in a different order okay we're looking at Reformation the invisible surroundings by Ray um and sort of like a video here that I can play but there's an image here this is a I will just as I know about this project I will describe it this is a you know a data visualization of weather data and that's uh I think there's a much larger uh conceptual underpinning to this project idea that you can read all about in the description but you can see these are the kind of projects um that are in the show um and and so what I'm going to do now it's time uh it's time doing my last one minute uh transition over to you so what's going to happen if I've set this up correctly YouTube has twitch has like a raid feature for streaming on Twitch YouTube has it's so creatively named YouTube redirect so when I hit the end stream button on the my YouTube interface it's going to send you to the um ITP stream directly and so I am really excited for you to go there because there will be students who are walking around and live demoing all of the projects from the show it's going to happen uh today let me see if I go here to the live stream oh oh my God it's already up with sound uh the show itself is happening again today and tomorrow both of these will be live streamed tomorrow May 15th I will be there in person so you might see me wander across the live stream subscribe to the ITP Channel come back to the ITB stream tomorrow and it's and I'm going to send you there now so I'll be in the chat as soon as you're all sent there so ask questions say hello in the chat thank you for tuning in to this ITP uh preshow I hope you enjoyed these coding train updates nature of code updates but it's time it's 2 p.m we're gonna head over there um and here we go let's see if this system works everybody you all ready for this okay that was embarrassing all right here we go I I uh here we go uh uh ah close close here comes I'm gonna hit end stream and I think you're being sent there uh thank you Silas for your nice comment all right here we go in three two one
