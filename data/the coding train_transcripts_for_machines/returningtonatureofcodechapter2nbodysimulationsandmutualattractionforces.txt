do do check one two here comes my mic uh let me know how the audio is over here oh double audio that could very well be happening yeah i'm uh uh why would that be happening well i'm coming on in a moment hopefully you're hearing my voice just once at least hello everybody good morning happy coding train on youtube live stream my name is dan i will be your host for today on this approximately two hour live stream with a bit of a break in the middle i'm just looking over here to see that i see green bars on my audio i see a preview image of myself on a little monitor in front of me this means i see a green light on open broadcast studio that me this means that everything is working well and i am coming to you live from the hudson valley of new york it's a warm day outside but the temperature is dropping i have sorted out the heating in this garage space so i'm quite comfortable right now but i have disabled and turned off and shut everything down so hopefully there will be no noise interruptions for today now before i get started with my list of things to cover today on this highly organized episode of the coding train let me take a moment to thank today's sponsor i hope this works brilliant do you like learning are you watching the coding train because you like computer science and algorithms and math and fractals and all sorts of fun stuff well watching videos and reading essays and books and text is one way to learn and i hope that you enjoy my videos but really if you want to really dive in and learn i might suggest that you check out brilliant it is full of interactive lessons around all of the kind of concepts and topics i talk about on the coding train in the middle of today's live stream i will come back and look at some of their courses and maybe try my hand at an exercise or two but you can sign up for free right now at brilliant.org codingtrain it lets them know that you found brilliant from me dan the coding train and they go wow dan recommended us and look all of that stuff um and then of course if you would like to unlock all of their premium features and courses you could do so and you'll get 20 off through that link for the first 200 people who sign up all right moving along here uh nope this is still the right button um um what's happening so first of all you might be wondering and i'm on item number item number two i said brilliant was item number one i do number two i'm on i'm on it says twitch so let me talk about that and i'm gonna take a peek at the chat here um okay uh do you read the comments sort of sometimes maybe arbitrarily if you see me looking this way it means i'm reading the chat i also actually have the chat over here but the font is so incredibly tiny i have to do this and then i have to take my glasses off and look up really close and it says hi dan you're the best i'm learning js thanks to you only ciao from italy ah okay so what's going on with the coding train live streams well i am experimenting with the platform known as twitch i like things that start with the twist sound like tuesday or twen's day today's friday so i've been i had this idea that i was going to stream on twitch on tuesdays and youtube on fridays no alliteration there there's no day of the week that starts with a u is there un saturday you use you today you today today is due today youtube bidet streaming no this is not going anywhere um i don't know i i'm 2022 is a new year for me because i have sabbatical from teaching and so i'm focusing on some new things you might have noticed that uh two coding challenge videos came out um slide puzzle and ascii to kind of like an image to ascii coding challenge which if you haven't watched please take a look at it lots of people are watching it it's one of my most uh sort of like immediately popular videos i mean it's all relative what's popular not popular on youtube but for me it's off the charts in terms of my sort of recent string of videos um and i've got another one which is coming out hopefully tomorrow because i released the ascii one saturday at about 11 a.m ish eastern i'm gonna try to do the same tomorrow and i'm going to talk a little bit about what's in that video tomorrow coming so i'm trying to get back to my roots of a weekly coding challenge video for 2022 um because i have a more a bit of more of elaborate production process if you watched that ascii coding challenge there's a lot more editing and additional graphics and things so um some bells and whistles literal bells and whistles are not literal because they're like sound effect bells anyway this is not the point um so i'm i was sort of experimenting with the idea of having sort of weekly edited videos on youtube openended live streams on twitch but i'm still gonna stream on youtube right now at least because i'm trying both platforms but um let me at least alert you to if you want to kind of follow me everywhere which i'm not suggesting you need to do by any means whatsoever let me at least um pull this up uh this is the twitch channel uh twitch.tv codingtrain a choo choo choo choo was taken i believe as well as coding train so i put them up it's not a portmanteau exactly but uh it's two words just smooshed together coding train choo choo if you have an idea for a a available name that i could take that's better than this uh feel free to let me know um you can see some recent broadcasts both of the um live streams i'm sorry both of the coding challenges the ascii one and the prime spiral were both recorded on twitch and then if you're looking for the archives i didn't think it made sense to just like reupload them to this channel obviously this live stream on youtube will live on this channel but if you're looking for coding train twitch i just made a new channel on youtube codingtrain twitch archive it doesn't even show up on google no oh no codingtrain here it is oh no here it is here it is this is a video from it there we go uh coding train twitch archive uh here here somebody can put this into the chat uh that's the just write that um channel down i guess i could give myself one of those vanity urls at some point but you can see the live the recent live streams on twitch are all here for you to go back and look at if you want to kind of catch up with that let me see here um if anything in the chat that i want to refer to youtube's day oh joseph suggest youtube's day the thing is i i i i got to stick to my list but um but just bear but but but indulge me for a moment um which is that one of the things that i have absolutely learned at the start of this year with my sabbatical is that teaching is not ultimately the impediment to me um really producing uh sort of regularly scheduled regular uh uh um frequent content on youtube there are lots of other things life gets in the way and i have other projects and initiatives that i'm working on so i'm not uh able to just suddenly like dive in in the way that i might have thought but i am getting these coding challenges out and i really want to use 2022 to experiment and sort of find the right balance between the different things that i'm doing with what i assume will be a return to teaching in 2023 although you never know never say never the sky's the limit with this youtube thing it's a little bit niche the creative coding tutorial stuff but you know you never know um and so for right now what i am hoping to focus on at least immediately is getting these kind of like fun short and short being like 20 to 30 minute coding challenges videos out i want to say every week but i think three per month is maybe a more realistic promise um i have something next anyway so i have some other stuff on my schedule and family commitments and stuff it's going to make the next coding challenge a little bit harder so the other thing that i'll mention where can i find this oh yeah if i go to twitch and i go to i don't really know uh twitch very well uh videos maybe oh no you know what i can just do i can do slash clips that is not how you spell clips coding train choo choo slash clips um so one of the things that i'm doing is that i and you can see that it's clipped like at the end so um i'm kind of trying to develop this rhythm where i record a coding challenge uh and then after i do that i spin a wheel i mean i've kind of done this before this might not be totally new to you but i'm trying to formalize this a bit more of ideas that i feel like will fit well into the format um and you can see this clip here um let's see if the audio comes through yeah i just did the ulan spiral recorded today's coding challenge and now i'm spinning the wheel for the next one which i will record next friday although i might have a conflict next friday we shall see sometime next week what are we going to get i do not have a conflict next friday because i'm here no keep going keep going keep going oh no no no and you'll see here that where we landed last week was the end body problem thus the title of today's stream the end body problem and i i so my process is and you'll see this in the prime spiral video like when i begin that coding challenge i have a pretty good sense in my head of what the prime spiral is because before i recorded that i you know read the wikipedia page and did a little research on it like very sort of perfunctory and i was kind of aware of what it was before also um but i hadn't programmed it before which i think really is important because as you'll see what is that sound i think it's just the wind but as you'll see i get stuck um a tree came down outside last night it's been very windy here but that was not a tree falling down um as you'll see in the video that comes out tomorrow please watch it when it comes out tomorrow if you don't mind or a monday enjoy your weekend don't watch youtube videos about coding on the weekend if that's not your thing um if you're watching this right now to be honest it probably is your thing um oh but i get stuck and confused quite a bit and make lots of mistakes and i think that's sort of the uh you know dare i say charm but more that what's important for me to communicate is show that this is the process getting stuck struggling trying to figure it out and uh you know i can't remember who suggested this so apologize someone in the discord suggested that i could do like a yearend wrapup and rate all my counting coding challenges from gravy train or from train wreck all the way to gravy train that one was probably in the middle it wasn't definitely wasn't a train wreck because i successfully solved it at the end probably if i would like try to think of the train wreck ones um that fluid simulation thing that i did that i really didn't understand and i was just trying to like type out formulas from a paper that was kind of nuts um so i'm just taking a picture of that so that's why the end body problem hits here so let me come back to that because i am going down my list i talked about twitch so um the other thing that i'm working on is i will soon be probably next week or you know march first maybe let's just put a date on it i will be putting out a big survey oh i don't know biggest right word i'll be putting out a regularly sized survey for the coding train viewers and community it's going to have lots of questions about what videos you like what what do you like about the live streams what you don't like i'm really trying to pare down and focus on what i think is not just like what is most popular with the audience so i'm not just going to like do uh you know sort of go in the i try to fight against the urge to just go in the direction of clicks although i can't help myself most of the time um but i want to hear from you and kind of figure out what makes the most sense and whether you prefer twitch or youtube for the live streams do you like the coding challenges do you like the tutorial videos somebody in the chat earlier said um and steve parker is asking let's see if this button works did not work i have a button on my stream deck that's supposed to post a link to the discord in the chat it doesn't it's just slash thecodingtrain.com or discord dot gg slash coding train those will take you to the coding train discord um you can barely hear me turn up your volume all right mike gained is a tad low i see that i worry because i really hate it when it's speaking so here's the deal people i will gladly turn up my by the way i ordered a new mic this is like a pretty old lab and i was having all sorts of interference that i ordered a higher quality one i need to do a lot of sound proofing in here still because it is quite echoey i don't know if you can hear that um so sound will be different after today's stream but i will turn the volume up for all of you i'm doing that right now i turned up the gain here so um but i would really like you to let me know if if any distortion or peaking happens it's like just a pet peeve of mine it really bothers me doesn't really it's not so great to like have it so low that we don't hear that because then anyway but hopefully that helps so um somebody in the chat it was a while ago and i filed this in the back of my brain briefly asked about like oh what about a series about processing for the pie so i would like to get back and today is a little toe dip into that i would like to get back to recording sort of more tutorial series that are like chunks of videos that are sequins that build upon each other and i think where i'm landing is i'm going to do much less production value on those and by production value image image and sound is kind of the same across the board but in terms of the amount of editing and additional animation i'm kind of leaving those for the coding challenge videos and especially videos that are have the potential to be more evergreen because for example i put a lot of effort into those discord bot tutorials that i made and they're basically completely irrelevant because discord updated their api uh anyway and i also just want to be able to make those faster so i hope to be getting uh some clipping now okay so just gonna turn it down a tiny bit there is a slight buzz i should so hope i'm going to ask about that in a second but um i um oh my goodness pi day is coming up holy okay adding this to my list because i actually am going i will be traveling i have done so little traveling in a few years but i think that i have a chance to do some in march um and i will be doing some traveling um uh i will be away on pi day so there will not be almost definitely not be a pi day live stream but i should prepare a coding challenge in advance of that to release on pi day and i better record that i'm going to have to i have to add just do a wheel spin of pi day ideas just for pi day so i i'm i'm in the market i have no idea for what i plan to do for pi day this year so i'm in the market for something usually i just take something that like stand up math or three blue one brown or some other youtube channel did years ago i'm like let me make my own version of that but uh um yeah pi day on a train i will not be on a train like i i i my preferred method it will come as no surprise to you of travellers train i really um uh my dream actually i would really like to go to japan this summer i'm just putting that out into the universe if anyone wants to invite me to anything um and i really want to go on the trains in japan i've never been to japan um got some wonderful trains in europe that i've been on mwah oh i love that taiji uh is that still like is that a a relevant uh uh a timely reference or it's like not anything anybody rides or says anymore okay be time traveling what is the keyboard shortcut for commenting out multiple lines at once uh command slash i believe uh all right so where are we on my list the survey so the survey will be coming out be on the lookout for that please fill it up i'm trying to think of what a good incentive will be i mean the only thing that we came up with so far as like uh uh we'll pick some random people filled out the survey to send them coding train stickers but if there's something you would like um you know a shout out a little video hello i don't know i'm happy to do any of those things i'm getting a text message here i don't know what that is um okay um all right so hmm looking at my list and i'm looking at the time um brandon asks do you want to derive pi or just do something fun with pi so yes to i want to do something fun with pi now deriving pi could be doing something fun with pi so it just it uh um it's important to me all right so it's not a pi day video if it doesn't sort of center around the number pi in some way um and i did do some i've done videos on estimating the value of pi through random chance and various kinds of things i've done like the leibniz sequence and some other like formula so you can look back and find some of the ones that i've done but something that has a good visual to it i think is always a nice pretty pattern uh certainly better than the rer is it is this train chat is this like i need like a sound drop for like hey everybody it's train chat time where we just talk about our favorite trains around the world huh oh i have this dream this other dream so i'm gonna uh just i'm putting this out there i don't maybe i shouldn't talk about the stuff on there i i want to go on a train i think they have these like um i'm basically just i am uh i'm basically just an old person who wants to go on like luxury train rides with they don't have to be luxury i just want them to have beautiful views and landscapes and i think they have some uh beautiful like kind of like tourist train rides i want the equivalent of a cruise that's on a boat but on a train and cruises aren't for me i don't think um i mean i like boats i like water what what am i even talking about right now scotland i hear this is a this is another a little fantasy of mine to go on a beautiful train ride through i don't know the scottish highlands or something is that a thing somebody will tell me um all right so one thing that i want to do is talk about community contributions so first of all i need corey says by the way this is a very relatable comment corey says this is oh i have a space heater under me which is not on but i keep kicking it um lol this is so strange i'm used to watching you at 2x speed yes apologies this probably sounds like i'm speaking like this to you my children's favorite pastime although we haven't done this in quite a while is to take my videos and put them on like 0.25 or 0.5 x because they think i sound ridiculous so um hogwarts train in scotland oh boy my my uh little harry potter fan uh super fans would uh in my household would love that uh train from spain to turkey i took a beautiful train in norway it was from oslo to addison i believe i think that was the route it was absolutely incredible um okay um have a little sip of my a coffee drink train to the highlands is my travel dream says chris sears i want to go to lockdesk so i actually have been to loch ness uh um i was in scotland once and uh it was that was that was an amazing trip there were no trains involved in that trip train from this is awesome these like uh these train recommendations i mean if i could go on like a world tour this is okay if i could just go on like a world tour of trains and like do coding videos while i'm on the train i mean ah that's what i should have been doing on sabbatical i have children who need to be driven to school and they need breakfast made for them so i can't just go travel the world on trains for the whole year i mean maybe one maybe you want to maybe this is more of a like a retirement or when they when they're off on their own if they ever move out and escape the nest then i could do that if you came to india check out our local trains in mumbai i would love to visit india uh there's a train that goes all the way across canada welcome to i really need okay hold on i think i got it uh where is it hold on just give me a minute here i'm looking at my sound board uh no no scary music that's not the train sound effect i had a whole like i guess i never when i redid the studio i never brought the my train sound effects here laughing no all right sorry i was gonna uh i was gonna i don't know what i was gonna do but it was gonna be great all right uh all right on to my next item on my list why did my computer go to sleep am i not plugged in no i am plugged in um okay so let's go to the coding train youtube page which i redid a little bit by the way so i guess i'm live streaming right now whoa there's a lot of people watching maybe i should stick to streaming on youtube don't have these numbers on twitch uh um so i i was kind of redoing this home page here to try to make it a little bit like you know start learning here and here are the coding challenges some of the other playlists that i recommend my popular videos why was i going here uploads yes so i want to go to this video and um i want to uh click over here so in every video you will see a link that goes to thecodingtrain.com now i'm a little bit delayed the reason why i'm bringing this up and it's a little bit unfortunate because i would love to be showing you the new website but i'm going to click over to the current existing website the new website will have the same content but as different design and we'll be featuring your work more and we'll even have a probably a different uh a way that you can submit without having to do a github pull request although you could still do that um so this is the coding challenge and if i go here this is here where is it like i'm going to cry uh um sound let's it seems like there haven't been made yet any variations based on this coding challenge by the community yet now first of all that's a very awkward sentence so i will be rewriting all the language on the new website but i'm shocked i'm shocked and dare i say appalled no i'm not appalled that this video which is one of my more popular ones which i think is ripe for you to remix and make your own version of um doesn't have any yet now in fairness this came out a week ago i haven't really been pushing the community contribution thing one thing i would love to hear suggestions for is um how what should i call these so community contributions i don't really like i mean that's what they are literally and i could either that could be a a way that we refer to them but i've got my little notebook here so if you have a good idea like to hear it now by the way i think i'm going to stick with the coding challenges i was going to try to rename them coding journeys everybody suggested coding adventures and i don't know if you're trolling me or not but that's sebastian lags thing and they're amazing i'm not calling by things coding coding journeys is probably a little bit too close to that frankly people had some great ideas like choo choo i don't remember what that one was but um community contributions could they be like uh passenger manifest i don't think that really works i don't know so give me your ideas but please submit them and since we don't have any to feature today i would like to do more of i'm going to be featuring them on the website more prominently so get yours in uh and they'll be on the new website but um what i would like to do is go ahead and look at the comments so i like to um i want to take a little time let's allow nice me whoops it's 10 30. let's try to take something with the word conductor train um uh something about trains contributions contributions is not about so um uh so by the way what is going on with my recommendations today interesting um so oh this is new i have not seen this that's kind of cool now they're supposed to be like little thumbnails there about what's going on i like this little chapters that's cool um so let's take a look at your comments which are mostly about like keeping it coding challenge but there was some oh oh just want to zoom in here a little bit there we go ah i guess i have to go down yeah there we go um let's take a look at um see if there's i know there were some interesting technical questions and things that were pointed out that i can discuss um all i can hear is the hot hot hot chocolate song for polar express i have no idea what that is does it go like this hot hot hot hot chocolate on the train you know back in the day people would make all these remix musical remixes of me doing weird stuff in videos it just doesn't happen anymore did all the talent musically talented viewers go off and become sensations they don't have time anymore all right um all right messed around with the some of the ascii shading characters and found that this combo works great ooh let's try this um so let's go back to uh you know one thing you should know that when you if you're looking for the code and this will be different on the new website but the same stuff will be there if you're looking for the code for any particular video if you find the corresponding page on the website you will see the different ways to view the code here so if i look at i want to look at just the ascii video one so in case you missed this video um you can see what it is and uh i do need to give so it is uh here here we go i am making a sort of like ascii render of myself but i have this variable oh god that is so windy outside so let's try this suggestion and see what we get oh that's cool wow that is wild i love this um yeah not much more to say about but thank you for this excellent suggestion um i mean it's much more like a pixelated version of the image i'm like kind of looking in close but that is really i love that thank you for this um and i'm gonna leave that as a comment i'm gonna go back to where i left the video with this particular um set of characters um let me go back and sort of see the um people are uh edge recognition yeah this would be interesting so one thing that i didn't do with this video that i would love to see if anybody um passenger proposition um one thing that um i didn't what didn't do is if you look at ascii art that people are making very carefully with sort of like hand selection or sort of manual curation of the characters the characters often really have meaning in terms of the contour of the thing that's being drawn um like if i just search like ascii cat i'm sure you know we would see things like this so this is not at all what i did this would be a fascinating thing to try to do i wonder if there is like a machine learning approach to this where we could train a model to have sort of photographic images and their ascii counterpoints counterparts that would be let me write that down ascii art ml model projects that i will never get to goes on the list here um so i didn't do that but i would love to see if anybody has an idea on to how to do that um thank you chris for this very nice feedback um coding challenge coding challenge right so this was pointed out i was very focused on figuring out how to when i'm making this sort of html dom version of the ascii characters how to deal with nonbreaking spaces and i could have just used white space pre as a css property 3d objects ascii style that would be awesome see you could do this you're this is what i want i want all of you to make the things you're suggesting um code stations i like that um okay people are really mostly talking about the name which i really appreciate but part of me wonders if this video is just popular because at the beginning of it i said let me know what you think i should call this series and i'm like flooded with comments about that so like the youtube uh thing the you know the the the uh the wizard behind the curtain at youtube is like oh lots of comments on this video keep suggesting it so i just need to at the beginning of our video be like what do you think of my hair today please let me know in the comments uh locomotive language learning caboose coding coding caboose i like um hey where's the rest of the comments why did it just stop it says 414 530 i wanted there were some really good ones with questions that i wanted to look at i really really should get it together am i already at my 10 minutes to um let me just see uh if i refresh this page if i can if i can scroll down faster yeah okay um yeah they just weren't now they're now they're loading um i can just zoom in there are some interesting questions that i want to take a look at um ah fresh noob hi freshnoob asked could i get some hints for how to have custom running text which forms an image referring to 1057 when you mention writing some poetry yeah so one thing you should realize that i'm doing and this is what chris manning made a nice uh friendly comment about is when i show a additional uh uh thank you yeah so jake i agree like that worked hard on that uh thumbnail oh i didn't work hard and that somehow i i worked hard on trying to ask around get a lot of advice and get help with the thumbnail um so um apprecia yeah um i'm sorry i lost sort by newest okay yeah there's too much stuff going on i had a thought that i wanted to talk about when ever i show an additional demonstration in the video even if i haven't coded it you can find that example here also included on the webpage so for clues about how to do that i can show you this one which is actually um since this is a sort of an ascii version of my dog gloria i know this is i don't know if this is easier for you to see it's very it's bright in here i just need to turn my monitor brightness up i don't think that changes anything for what you're seeing um i think this is like from um ah why am i blanking on the name of the book by jack london with the wolf in it did i forget to eat breakfast again today this is what happens when i don't eat breakfast like things that i know about and that i've read in my life but anyway i just pulled something from public domain project gutenberg um so this is not using the specific characters to generate a brightness in fact there's lots of extra spaces in here that make it uh that add additional noise but i'm just coloring the characters but you can see i'm walking through them so the idea here is that if i were to go to here you can see um you can see the text from the book and then in the code itself i'm loading the full text i called it gloria.txt call of the wild thank you and then uh i am just getting a character from that text but also cycling through them so there's this appearance of motion so if you were curious about that okay so uh thank you for that question i think i'm at 10 40. let me just scroll through and see if i can get one more um um question that i thought so i really should go through these in advance and prepare which ones i want to talk about um oh yeah this is the one this is actually a really important one i should answer this right now but um maybe somebody can reply so the density array seems wrong there are bright characters at one end and dark characters are the other but in the middle it's just all the numbers in numerical order which i highly doubt is also the order of density so let's address this really good point and i wish i had sort of thought to mention this or look at this in more detail in the video so this one the current one that i'm using by my eye and i didn't do a proper calculation here these characters are actually ordered from darkest and there's many many many many many blank spaces for sort of like thresholding any brightness below a certain value and then brighter brighter brighter more and more like characters now this one if i switch back to this one and unfortunately this is in the wrong order now also so it is uh this is inverted but you get the idea um it is very true that this albeit um you know these characters over on this side you can see are have fewer and fewer pixels if you will ramping up to full of pixels over here the numbers are just arbitrarily in order and at a glance probably seven is a darker represents a darker pixel versus like zero so um i didn't think about this i just kind of tossed this in there and it comes from the uh ascii playground uh which is from um andreas gishens and i apologies for maybe um mispronouncing the name i made several mistakes one is when i was looking at this quickly i just assumed that's a shader you know i just throw export function main out of the corner of my eye and i was like that's shader code oh thank you herobrine very kind of you um exploring tracks that's interesting um so this is not this is just plain javascript it's just what i'm doing um and we're pulling characters from this density array and so i assume that um andreas who goes by erta which i now know is the order of keys on the keyboard e r t d f g c v b um is just using that character because it creates nice patterns and there's something quite lovely about seeing the numbers i think in order i'm sorry that this is might be very like flickery to you um so i just kind of lifted this as a nice starting set of characters but i think the decision is made not just purely out of brightness for these sort of more abstract ascii visualizations um this is more and i and i probably if i'm really trying to authentically match the image i would want to be more um precise about the which characters i choose and in what order and i have seen i believe in the processing um ascii video let's see if uh well here's the get i don't know if there's a better place for me to find this example but this is a um this is an example from the processing um ide and you can see this is like uh a ton of more characters and probably i'm assuming yeah sorted according to their visual density so i don't know ben fry made this ring the bell for ben frye um i'm assuming that ben did some like you know phd level like hyper sophisticated analysis of these letter forms um and i could copy paste that into my code you could take a look at this one lots of stuff to explore all right so that's so let me just give you a little pitch here to encourage you uh on the one hand i'm encouraging you to make your own to watch this video if you haven't let me know what you think do you appreciate all the extra bells and whistles bells and whistles or would you rather me just make more videos without any editing blah blah blah and oh the ascii fluid simulation that josh davis in the chat is mentioning is chef's kiss i have seen that um so uh make your own version uh watch the video make your own version but even better uh the video that's coming out tomorrow the prime spiral video it will definitely be out by monday hopefully tomorrow youtube members twitch subscribers github sponsors patrons of all these different ways you can sign up for the sort of supporter community um i do share earlier versions of the videos you're not missing anything if you're don't worry the video comes out you see it a day later but i will hopefully be sharing that with you all of you a little bit early at least for like feedback um and mark boots is writing it depends on the font family too i guess and that's absolutely true so please watch that prime spiral video comment on it let me know what you think about it and make your own version of it and share it with me on the website social media also also works well tag the coding train on twitter or the.coding.train on instagram all that jazz okay going back to my list ah so i mentioned the prime spiral let me let me just show you give you a little sneak peek here of just the code itself um let me open up the i think just this one everybody which wish chris a happy birthday was chris's 50th birthday not chris manning in the chat no idea what chris manning's age is a friend of mine named chris i'm sure he'll appreciate i made a little p5 sketch here i'll show it to you uh uh uh since it popped up i think people are gonna ask uh here we go everybody wish chris the happiest birthday it was a while ago now but uh okay i don't think chris is watching the chris associated with this video okay let me go back to the spiral so this is the ulam spiral or the prime spiral um what is happening is i am counting numbers from one to the theoretically infinity obviously i have only a certain amount of space on the screen and when it is a prime number i am marking it with a dot uh this was um this idea comes from the mathematician stanislav ulam i talk about a little bit about the history of this in the video program this i have a lot of trouble getting the spiral to work correctly so the video that comes out tomorrow will show you how to do this program showcase station all right this i'm really liking showcase station where am i going to write this showcase station all right that so far is the winner i like everyone's saying um so i until i hear something better uh forevermore corey james cooper when i say like i forgot who suggested this it was you you could refer back to this clip clip it if this was a twitch stream you could clip it thank you i mean we might not call it that there's a lot of people gonna weigh in other ideas no promises but that's right now the winning suggestion as far as i'm concerned all right um so now you've seen the prime spiral i do have some additional examples that i need to make still for the video i will probably just do those on my own later today in my copious amounts of free time but i sort of had hoped to maybe do those today but i don't think that i can so i we're about to get to uh okay so let me get to my next topic then i'm going to take a short break and then i'll have the last hour hopefully for going through and talking about the end body simulation spinning the wheel for the next topic and um pi day i was about to like um and oh a pie no pi day isn't a thing i just you can clip on youtube also how did you do the hearts on the birthday sketch asks kathy mcginnis so the hearts are if you look for my a fireworks coding challenge which is quite an uh a one from quite a while ago from july 2nd uh 2016. let's see if we go here and i think actually uh oh no i i really don't think that i took this from this let's take a look i think i did this also in in parallel but let's take a look yeah this looks different good okay so i'm glad to see that this looks sufficiently different that i clearly did the same it's a different slightly different heartshaped uh that i clearly didn't just coplift this code um but um i remember that david snyder made a version i don't see it here look at this all right can we all just celebrate for a moment i don't know when this was submitted and maybe caitlyn is you know 15 or 16 now caitlyn using her dad's github account which is good because i don't believe you can have your own account until you're at least 13. um and totally uh it's three cheers for both caitlyn and her dad uh let's take a look at these rainbow fireworks oh look at that oh and they go kind of like off to the side which is way where my fireworks just went right up in the air like they're all going to the right though is it a random trajectory is it always the same oh no it's definitely a random that looks different these are beautiful great job caitlin i hope you're still watching in coding train and coding or maybe if you moved on to something else that's great too that's great nobody needs to spend their life like me just making p5 sketch after p5 sketch after p5 sketch it's okay you can do other things ah all right so the way i did this if i go to the web editor version of the sketch i think i did i think the coding challenge i might have done it here under firework.js let me look um just trying to look for where i create all the particles new particle if this dot exploded where do i make ah here we go so i make new particles there we go i make new particles this is it and the particles right here get a random velocity um let me run this sketch for you and show you uh how this works so this is my origin we could actually this is my original sketch so these just look like um things exploding randomly and there's no pattern here but if i were to take this off and i were to say this dot velocity dot multiply 5 wind you're going to see something different see how they form a perfect circle so the initial velocities of each one of these um fire each one of these particles uh determine like where it kind of like ends up in its trajectory before it begins to fall and fade out so a random vector is any vector along the perimeter of a circle but there's no reason why and i could use the whiteboard let's see if this let me come over here so what's happening is i have a whole bunch of particles that all start from the same point and they pick a random velocity if that random velocity is any direction but the same magnitude those vectors all point out to the perimeter the circumference of a circle so if i just knew a whole lot of vectors for some shape like a heart and then i could pick every firework gets one of these random vectors it's going to explode out into that form and you we could use letter forms um there's so many things we could do beyond just hearts and i i a bunch of people made creative versions of this i remember seeing them i don't know why they're not all on the website maybe the links went dead and we removed them or they weren't shared on the website because this was you know five or six years ago at some point where i did this but there's a lot of fun things and i'd be glad to go through this in more detail at some time but i should get back to my uh list of things all right now uh one thing that i think that i might need to do here i worked very hard on the lighting for this whiteboard and i just realized that i might not have actually focused the camera yeah that's better so good thing i discovered that now and i can come back over here um okay yeah and sit back is saying is is correctly saying like this this code like if i go into my the happy birthday thing let's just find it um if i look at the particles this is the math for a heart pattern it's like this uh trigonometric uh equation and actually heart curve i think i'd uh p5 look at this february 18 2019 the heart curve so if you want to learn about the equation to draw a heart there you go i've got another video for you i've got one for everything except not really but if i live to be a hundred i will get them all eventually all right um uh okay let's see so moving on let me give you an update on the nature of code so slow going so far i'm working with two wonderful nyu students who are helping me with the nature of code project um and i just want to give you an update on that because i know it's of great interest yeah so if you want it okay this is not it igor give me back my url it's not mine it's yours you registered it i don't own it i'm happy you have it nature dash of dash code okay so this is um the collection of repos for the nature of code project um and um the chat is wonderful i wish i could just like read every comment aloud and and reply to them but but know that i'm seeing all your wonderful um comments now um or actually i'm probably not seeing all of your wonderful comments i just saw kathy and abhijits they're great i'll read them i used your heart code to make a valentine's day sketch for my husband i love that and abhijit writes it must feel good when you search something general and google shows your own videos it's a little bit eerie actually the weirdest thing that happens this is this happens to me a lot is like i'm trying to figure out how to do something that i don't know how to do i search and i find like my explanation or my vid like my results are coming up to try to help me but i'm like no those don't help me i made those they don't that's what i'm looking for or weirdly enough they actually do and i just forgot how to do it completely another thing that welcome to my life i'm sure you all needed to know that little tidbit um so i'm actively working on this project one thing i'm just going to just uh um show just really quickly mention is i'm working on a new method to have a draft of the book in notion to make writing a little bit easier this has actually been pioneered by um folks at itp and other books that people are working on it's not my idea and then the the notion project automatically comes back into github as markdown so there's still be an open source like markdown version of the book but when i'm trying to like write something new i don't have to like edit the markdown which could be kind of awkward actually the current book is even worse than that um in the sense that if i go to the content and look at any given chapter it's actually just raw html so right now if i want to like rewrite the book or edit it i've got to be editing this html which is really painful and the thing that i here's my new mantra i have been saying i want to make a second edition of the nature of code for at least five years the book came out in december 2012. i started working on it probably in 2008 which is just insane to me um and it's just never getting done so like uh yes i wanted to have this html system so i could perfectly refine and markup and format everything i ever wanted in this book but printer printer making noise everything's fine but if i'm not getting to rewrite the new version because it's too like much effort and complicated and i've got to like i just need a simpler workflow and i just need to make it happen if this you heard it here well not first because i've been saying this now for the last couple weeks but you heard it here if this nature of code second edition is not out by the 10 year anniversary of the first edition i'm never doing it i'm not doing it it's never going to happen so whatever happens i got to get it done this year i do need time to invest in that so i will apologize if the youtube channel or the twitch streams go dark for a little bit uh at present they don't need to do that and it's still way higher on my priority list which i think is kind of the problem to be frank um although my name is dan um yeah so um and but i would love i people are so interested in helping and i just don't know how to harness that interest and excitement enthusiasm so right now i don't have any calls for help um with the nature of code book but your your support and your enthusiasm goes a long way all right okay it is 11 o'clock i managed to do what i i i said i was not going to keep doing which but i had a list that i went through and these were important pieces of information and announcements and you're all you're all still here most of you some of you hi thank you so i need to take a short break to get some water and before i take my break i would like to tell you once again about it's the olympics so this is my today's sponsor brilliant by the way it's not even a script i like just do this off the cuff but i like to make it sound like a script do you like learning i like learning you like learning too wait are you watching the coding train do you like programming and computer science and math and algorithms and interactivity and visuals and all that stuff oh so do i if you like all that stuff uh you are going to love brilliant um i'm i'm being kind of silly right now but it is really a wonderful uh website and platform to for to continue learning journey uh again like i said this at the top of the stream um videos i hope you enjoy my videos i hope they help you learn and and bring some joy to your day and inspire you um but i do think that watching videos and reading books and by wait we should put reading books probably at the top of the list there before the videos are wonderful things um being able to actually try stuff yourself for me has always been the way uh the path towards understanding and exploration for me and brilliant uh really just has an amazing set of courses and tools and resources with interactive lessons and quizzes and a whole community of people doing this stuff so i'm going to just show you very quickly two of my favorite um courses from brilliant one is the um uh algorithm fundamentals sorry and you can see that like this is basically a wonderful complement and companion to learning to code this is an interactive lesson about doing an insertion sort algorithm and you can move all the pieces around it's pseudo code so you don't need to know a particular programming language but the the the site is just full of these kinds of interactive exercises and lessons that allow you to explore all of your programming wonderful now that that clip ended it was supposed to loop so apologies for my technical mistake there um they also have this wonderful course about neural networks so i you know i spend a lot of time on my channel doing uh videos about machine learning and neural networks and this particular course you can see here you know i i wish that i had in my videos a sort of uh a an interactive explanation and demonstration of how a neural network can recognize handwritten digits um and uh i forgot to turn on looping so you got to come back and see me um so let's go let's go wander over to the uh brilliant website for a minute um and it's going to let's take a look at it um i have been doing the logic course um i was i i um and a bunch of these also this is really one of my favorites i mean the thing about the ones the one thing that i really love about brilliant honestly uh for me personally is i need more ideas for videos and i was just looking at a lesson i forgot which course it's in about the kerninsburg i'm probably saying that bridge the konigsberg bridge problem um which is a wellknown um problem around graph theory and with math so i was like oh i could do that as a coding college the seven bridges of kerningsburg um so uh um there's you know these are the kinds of problems that are really rich and ripe for this so let's take a quick look um i kind of want to go back to this beautiful job oh i love the what is what's infinite data structures i can't pick let's go back to abstract order logic i don't remember actually doing this one i think i might have just started it i didn't really get very far with it let's take a look um the evil core robots continued their physical fitness evaluation but it's day two and they're getting tired their selfreporting of results while still accurate is even spottier based on limited information it's possible to tell exactly how the races ended up there are multiple possible outcomes okay how many different orders could the racers finish the only report that rey finishes ahead of tie so here's a possibility one two three i've definitely got three right so let's think about this if rey is ahead of tie ray cannot be last so re can only be in one of these two spots if rey is in this spot a tie has to be here so there's only one configuration if ray is in this spot there's two configurations because tai and marv could switch so three should be the answer you know brilliant should really include these drum rolls into their website they have wonderful sound effects but i got it right okay so um i hope you can sort of get the idea oh i want to just keep going with this because they're so fun to do but i'm just going to encourage you i'm gonna take a one or two minute break sign up at brilliant.org codingtrain lets them know that you found out about um brilliant from me there's the url on the screen and it's it's free you can sign up for free there is a premium subscription that you can get through that link the first 200 people to do so will get 20 off of that it's also a wonderful gift you can gift a premium subscription to somebody if you don't know what to get them and they love learning um i would certainly suggest that as well um okay so i'm gonna take hopefully just like a two minute break uh uh where you could talk amongst yourselves sign up for brilliant enjoy uh stretch your legs and arms i'm gonna grab a little bit of water um and i will be back within two minutes and we are going to finally if you were here for the end body stuff uh that's what i'm doing from about 11 10 to noon here eastern time i'll be right back so check check making sure my mic is back i i've gone through great lengths some unit multiple in a million different possible ways during this break oh i better come back look at how everybody's leaving all right i have returned it was hopefully less than two minutes or it was probably about two minutes um andrew isaac asked will you be considering approximations like quad trees yes so i'm a little to be honest this is where my list that i made of things to go over today in today's stream kind of falls apart because i don't really have an exact plan here but let me um let me uh give you back let me get myself i was kind of going to organize my tabs and things during the break but um instead i'm just going to do that with you all watching um let me close these out um and i don't need any of these open um and uh okay so let's let's figure out what we're doing here so first so let's start here okay so the idea of the end body problem or maybe a better search for me here would be like an nbody simulation um because there's this really incredible one uh that i love oh it's actually not this one although i'm sure this one is great there's a really all right i'm not gonna i'm not gonna just randomly scroll through wikipedia right now but the idea of an end body problem is let me come back over here and i have to apologize uh those of you have been tuning in on twitch recently you'll know that when i'm over here i can't really see the chat or anything that's going on but hopefully everything looks right um the idea of an end body problem and i wonder if i should be recording this i'm just going to record this just in case hold on ultimately i want to turn this into a tutorial video but i don't know if i feel ready to do that today but just in case i want to use any of this material i have a system by which i can record what i'm doing to disk all the various parts of it so that i can reput it together later all right so um yeah i think i'm going to just allow myself to be very freeform here and not and kind of let you know where my brain is at and we'll see where this leads so if you've been following the nature of code series which i have not continued in quite a while chapter two is all about forces and apologies for the shaky white board um and it starts off by looking at just force equals oops force equals mass times acceleration and how i can translate that into euler integration which is a very fancy sounding name for the code that's in almost every one of my examples that has like velocity add acceleration and then position add velocity so the idea is that we have a body that has a position vector of where it is as well as a velocity there are forces in the system which affect the acceleration which then alters the velocity which then alters the position that's the core idea of the sort of physics simulation behind the nature of code the really limiting factor uh to the sort of like level of sophistication and breadth and depth of what i am able to achieve in those sort of basic examples is really due to this simpler simple integration technique like i'm not really using laws of motion and ordinary differential equations and all those kinds of things that you might find in a physics textbook i want a rapid fast algorithm and uh implementation to make stuff happen so this is what the reason why i gave you all that backstory is because this is a body i'm starting to feel like oh maybe i could actually use this i'm recording it yay this is a body so an n body like a two body let's just talk about like what would be a two body simulation or what is the twobody problem what if i had two bodies what would be the motion of these bodies based on the forces in their environment now but we're talking about a very specific kind of force and the kind of force we're talking about is gravitational attraction the force of gravity equals the universal constant g times the mass of one object times the mass of another object divided by let's call this vector r the magnitude of r squared the distance squared um times the unit vector r and vice versa so this object is attracting this so what would the motion of those bodies be in a two body simulation let's go back to the computer i can sort of take a peek at the chat here for a second this is the beginning stages so if i look for under two body problem we can see uh we could take like the sun and the earth as the examples and you can sort of see there's something very similar going on to my formula here but um um and the two body problem is famously solved uh meaning we could actually calculate precisely the motion of these objects these bodies um and um let's just do like i always see like um i feel like when i was um you know there's always like wonderful blog posts like here we go this is just one that i happened to find we could see somebody made a beautiful kind of simulation showing this sort of solution and mapping out these orbits of the two bodies here so um i ultimately um in if oh sorry let's now let's go to uh the nature of code uh playlist and as you'll see where up where i left off back when i was recording these in april of 2020. oh hey anybody remember april of 2020 i wonder why there were no more videos until january of 2021 and i didn't record this these just finally came out i mean i think i recorded all these in early march and yeah remember that all right but this particular example if i go to it is showing what looks kind of like an end body problem in a way like oh these are celestial bodies kind of orbiting around something it's like oh one if i just had one of these for example um if let's just change it to i'm sorry i'm having trouble with my spacing here when i recorded my last coding challenge i was standing in front of the code too much but i do have more room here so let me space this out a little bit better um i want to just change this to one you can say like oh is this the two body problem uh and if i sort of like were to somehow put in the uh relative masses of the sun and the earth and like an initial velocity would i get something that resembled the earth's orbit and if i drew it with the sort of like sun everything being like relative to the sun's position even if um you know then would i see something so the answer most likely is no because in my uh sorry in all of my examples i am using this highly approximate technique so i would need to have you know really solve in a sort of pure mathematics way the equations of motion to map that precise orbit pattern so that's problem number one problem number two is i'm actually not doing that in this example there is only the force of this pink dot attracting the other circle so there is no mutual attraction one body has exerts a gravitational force on the other the other uh exerts that same gravitational force on the that one body but in the other direction so all of this to say is to say here i am wanting to make a video or a coding challenge or more likely what i think probably makes sense should just be 2.6 like the next video in this sequence what direction do i go in so certainly i absolutely could solve right now for the issue where i wasn't doing both forces so i feel pretty confident because i i've already done this it's actually in the textbook itself i could show you a sort of simulation of this two body problem by giving both uh mutual mutually attracting each other i would not however have solved for optimizing this i think i don't want to go down the road of looking deeper into the mathematical equations a little bit i like to say out of scope as like uh like i don't excuse is the wrong word but like an escape valve for when i'm like i'm just not prepared to do that it doesn't really fit into how i've worked these code examples i'm not i haven't really researched this i just can't like do this off the cuff today i don't feel like but but but really it's just not a scope um so um so that's one direction i could do it wouldn't be so interesting with two bodies but it certainly could be interesting uh with n bodies and in fact i did do that let me show you um let me show you if i go to my and i'm just gonna switch over here for a second i'm gonna go to my twitter for a second because during the month of january there was an initiative and apologies that i don't have to scroll through this for a while um there was an initiative called january which was to do like a sort of creative project every day and that this one was that was the like i did little things like this this was for day 30. organic looking output look using only rectangular shapes flocking simulation so i want to go down and find my um the prompt i did for the day called space there was a day where the prompt was space and i basically took this idea of mutual attraction and actually you can see it here this is a variation of it i did with uh just adding some color so this is an nbody simulation it's basically doing whoops exactly this formula with like zillions of particles it's not really i don't remember how many i used and kind of drawing them with some additive blending giving them an initial state that caused that sort of results in this swirling pattern um but uh i even used somebody had asked about a quad tree i used some but it this was rendering at about like you know a frame per five seconds you know i just didn't do any so i don't know that i could probably do a version of this with like a thousand particles uh we might get somewhere kind of interesting so that's something that i could do and then there's one other thing that i'm kind of intrigued by so if i'm making a list of options there's just option number one is uh add this is probably what i want to do add mutual attraction but keep euler integration that sort of simple thing and then uh two bodies and then go to n bodies and then maybe add quadtree which is actually a there's something called the barnes hut which i have not researched in detail barnes hut did i say barnes nut i think it's barnes hut i don't remember um which is i think just ultimately applying a quad tree to n bodies but maybe it has to do with like adding the forces in each cell of the quad tree or something so it's a slight variation on that i think so this is what i'm thinking of doing the question is is this a coding challenge or is it 2.6 nature of code that's the quest that's question number one another question is is it worth investigating improving the integration and sorry that i'm just kind of not writing this well but i was reading about something called leapfrog integration which is kind of doing sort of like these sort of partial updates multiple times through a given time step um that can maybe make the actual motion a bit more accurate to the true physics i'm not super inclined to do that i feel like that's out of scope but i'm thinking about that and then the other thing the last thing i want to mention before i i don't know what i'm what i'm really doing today ultimately i'm talking this through is what i'm doing and then i come back next week or tomorrow or uh stay an extra little bit of extra time i don't really know um but um there's one other thing i want to mention which is really cool and i i'm not looking at your feedback right now i really want to hear your feedback but um um so um uh where am i oh i'm in the wrong thing okay so i'm gonna do like a quarry three body choreographies i think this will pull up the paper i'm looking for um um look uh dan grease did the visualizations for the paper uh yep this is what i'm looking for um oh so this is actually the visualization i want to find the paper though very briefly um uh antaldi uh uh paper choreographies sorry i really meant to have these things ready to show you yeah this is what i'm looking for uh pdf okay so there's this amazing paper that i have yet to read i've skimmed it because i only found it like yesterday afternoon which is looking at a particular set of stable orbits of three body um of three bodies so it's a kind of like a paper about an apologies if i'm kind of mischaracterizing this this is my sort of cursory understanding of this but basically it's looking at a set of initial conditions for a threebody problem that produces these stable orbits because that threebody problem is famously chaotic and so one of the things that i thought is could i try to and and and uh dan greece who did these i'm gonna ramp up the speed here did these visual um visualizations of these particular orbits um like if i click on this one four on oh these aren't just three bodies these are end body choreography so these are four i was curious to see if i could try to recreate this how close i could get using just like euler integration so these were done using i guess like a sort of fourier um set of fourier transforms uh i believe um and so these are just sort of like the precise routes there's not a physics simulation going on here so that's like a quite an aside but i could do that just as a video itself so i don't know how to decide or how to ask you um there's a threebody novel problem novel i have not read that three body problem novel what is this a science fiction novel written by the chinese writer okay i gotta write this down three body novel well i should read that before i do this three body novels i'm just going to take a quick scan at the chat take the temperature for a second here real time on gpu that's probably not going to have happen um yeah i mean so so by the way if you're looking for the sort of like latest and greatest most highest end like you know compute shader probably like n body simulation like people are doing these and there's like amazing ones uh i don't know like which one of these to click on how how old or recent they are but this is a thing that people do which is to create these very highend fully optimized gpubased endbody simulations um but that's again that's not really my thing like i want to teach the concepts and give you kind of like a basic kind of bitesized working version simon wrote that's a trilogy it's being turned into a netflix or amazon series well by golly are you serious how can i how can i capitalize on that so simon's saying there's no reason you can't make it both a coding challenge and 2.6 of nfc absolutely so conceptually that's what it is the question is which way is it branded and what what's its like home base like is it a video that has the nature of code visual treatment it's called 2.6 that's much more tied to me just sort of doing a tutorial about this concept or is it a coding challenge where i'm kind of more building it as we go again both of these are kind of the same thing ultimately in how my process but it has a thumbnail looks it's called a coding challenge it has the number and then i could just drop it into the nature of code playlist as like a wrapup of the chapter i'm kind of leaning towards that right now rungekutta is another thing that is being suggested yes so that's another i guess what i want to know from all of you experts out there is if all i do is take my simple gravitational attraction example with euler integration create an array of the body of the things um and calculate their mutual attraction forces with the same exact technique basically this if i add mutual attraction so each body attracts each other one i try with two maybe i try with three i could represe i could i could refer this is what i'm going to do i think i've got it i could refer to those choreographic things maybe try some of them and then i could just sort of see how it goes with a lot of them how far i can sort of do the performance maybe i can incorporate this maybe this is just like an additional reference but this is my trajectory if i call it n body if i talk about how i'm doing this as an end body simulation are people going to get hung up am i doing a disservice by sticking with this really uh the sort of like simplest basic a form of integration that's highly inaccurate so i'm not really doing a uh i'm not attempting to create a realistic realistic is wrong where i want it to feel realistic but i'm not attempting to actually match the orbits of how real in our universe celestial bodies would interact with each other so that's kind of where i'm landing through this full explanation and i don't know what to try to achieve now in the next 30 minutes i mean it's being developed by the same people did game of thrones this is crazy all right so i'm just going to take a moment to think and like take a look at the chat sebastian lag oh that's not for me okay yeah turn it into einstein newton was yesterday yeah but see where my brain i'm still in the world of newton in the way that i think about creative coding and simulation um i don't think it needs to be accurate you're not trying to put a satellite into orbit says uh fishy 22 in the discord okay yes i'm in agreement with you so now the question let's make a poll i think i know what you're going to answer and i don't want to do i kind of want it to just be 2.6 but i'm going to i'm going to put a little poll okay i'm definitely reading this book joseph i'm kind of i'm sort of stuck in this other fanta this fantasy series that's incredibly long and i'm being very slow at reading it i'm kind of busy and so i don't know if i should start saying no berlit integration uh freya uh oh look denise lehigh welcome you're the latest passenger conductor whoa to board the coding train thank you so much for your support um i really appreciate it i don't know if you're actually watching right now but um uh you get a random number remember remember this whole random number thing that i i all i do is start things and not follow them through i'm going to give you a random number anyway we're on page 314 row 15680 column something nine it's not it's your random sequence of five digits it's 93791 um and um i've got to figure out these are really uh apologies to everyone working on getting the conductors these train whistles um but i think if you've signed up on the conductor level one of these with a um random walk cus a unique random walk pattern is coming to you uh i'm very sad because i'm no one to blame but myself but um okay um all right wait magnus writes he hasn't even started yet oh no oh no see this is there's been some value in this and this is incredibly valuable for me i got to like go through a lot of lists of announcements and things in par give you information about my process and updates on my schedule things that are going on in the coding train universe and uh i'm thinking through what i'm going to do with this end body thing but i realized that like i'm getting really dangerously close to the end of this live stream and i have not even made a single coding example um um so let's put this poll in it's the same topic the same content but is it branded coding challenge branded 2.6 nature of code uh whoops i post this poll do i have to have three options um which one ask your community don't pick i guess i could call this like see results all right i think i posted this poll um let's see if i coding challenge as a recap of noc so um swarm simulations and i have that on my list um i mean i have done you know flocking simulations but i think there's a specific kind of i don't know why that poll didn't show up oh there it is um eric is here hi eric i haven't seen you in a while um so ah you're also on discord great so teamise make sure you sync your discord and youtube accounts so we can uh give you all the info there on discord um in terms of the member channel stuff um yeah so i think the real question here the reason why i'm i'm kind of airing against coding challenge or leaning against coding challenge even though that's winning currently in the poll is that um i i like the coding challenges to sort of start from a blank slate whenever is possible i mean obviously i'm using p5 and i'm sometimes we'll pull in other libraries or other known techniques but i really want to just start this from where i left off the previous code all right i think that makes the decision for me and the numbers are pretty close like they're right now it says 40 coding challenge 30 41 coding 34 so like that's enough like my vote counts for a lot it counts are at least 5 so i can push it over the edge uh and and you know famously all i ever do is do the opposite of what the pole says i don't know why so i'm starting to think this should be um um nature of code 2.6 and um that's what i'm thinking right now the question is and why did the the question is what the heck am i going to do with the next 20 minutes all right how about this um 25 of you abstained that's a high number um yeah and that's simon is saying for the end of every chapter you have a coding challenge that combines all the stuff from the chapter and you know you know you're kind of getting me i'm leaning back towards that idea because that's kind of what i wanted with the original and if you look at the i think if this comes up i think if you look at the playlist and the way that it's organized that's what i do for chapter three and in a way that's what i do for chapter five because um i just didn't put it in the playlist because i have flocking as a coding challenge and that's what i do for chapter three i have these coding challenges that kind of synthesize all the concepts so yeah let's do that let's call this coding challenge i'm going with oh no wait just as i swung back the other way branded nature of code is like coming up in this almost feeding branded coding challenge ah this is so hard i could still do a different coding challenge that wraps up the chapter um mean i think the real answer here is people just want me to make the video not just spend forever figuring out like whether it's called 2.6 or coding challenge number 1 60 what number am i on now image to ascii is 166. prime spiral is 167 so it would be number 168. all right the other thing i could do is not worry about that at all and just kind of record the tutorial slash challenge and um um and um just come back and record like an intro for it later depending on how i end up sort of positioning it oh it's tied right now if you haven't voted yet you have tremendous power oh wait i haven't voted yet oh it doesn't let me vote uh uh consider that the c results are asking you to vote on their behalf yeah so that means i get 29 of the votes which is basically enough okay the the irony here is this there's no point in me trying to decide this today because i can't do this in 20 minutes could i do this in a half an hour and stay a little longer let me stop and restart recording okay one thing that i should do oh nature of code well how do i end the poll does it end automatically end pull all right i'm gonna give it i'm gonna give it um one more minute which uh is uh uh i'm gonna give it one more minute uh i'll just put a timer on my watch one minute okay in one minute i'm clicking end poll and certainly uh if it says branded nature of code that's what i'm gonna do if it says coding challenge i'll think about it ah they're back to tied i think the guy i think the audience is just trolling me to like try to keep it even coding challenge please says ashik um i mean this is the thing like what am i doing today i think if i do it by the way is the nature of code tutorial i have a greater chance of doing it today the other thing is here's my reasoning i'm kind of making the decision that the coding challenge videos will involve more less preparation and more uh postproduction to make them kind of like short entertaining videos and the nature of code videos or again it's the same me and this sort of will be a little bit more like just let's just let me just code this let's edit it together let's put it out oop timer is done i'm going to go hit end poll and the numbers are final uh it went away but it was at 38 percent oh yeah there we go 311 votes 38 nature of code 33 coding challenge 27 see results all right the people have spoken no matter what i won't always follow what the poll says now the question is can i do so i don't need to do that full recap i do need to take a look at if you'll bear with me let me take a look at the 2.6 video um and just see like what i say at the end 2.5 sorry is going to be equal to the mass of one object times the mass of the other object divided by the distance squared um oh well i mean i could have saved myself a lot of trouble if i just watch that before i begin this whole discussion because that's the whole that's i mean i the video says that and i never did it because 2020. i came back and i just started with chapter three all right so i'm just crying because i took this whole live stream to like come to this conclusion and now i have like 15 minutes left i mean the next real commitment i have is at 1pm but i need to walk the dog i need to eat some lunch hmm i'm just trying to think like realistically like even if i said i'm gonna go to 12 30 am i gonna record this whole thing in 45 minutes i guess i could give it a try could i begin it and come back and finish it later or maybe i should just maybe i should just take the 15 minutes now to kind of do some quick experiments to like figure out what i'm going to do with the 2.6 video oh i really really really got myself into uh quite the pickle here all right i got myself all dressed up combed my hair i feel like this is a good shirt to wear for the nature of code i you know maybe what i'll do is i'm going to just act as if i'm going to start this tutorial but um i can uh like put the same clothes on and come back and finish it another time or maybe i'll just gain some momentum and finish it now or it'll just be practice so this will be practice this is practice i want to leave this up here because i might like to refer to that and this is the example where i left it so duplicate let's call this nature of code two let me call it mutual attraction and i wonder if i change this to 400 by i just feel like i don't have the right amount of space here to code i need that to be further over okay that's better um just make these a little smaller too there we go um i'm being eight so this is good this is this is my starting point okay now i will need to do i now the question is is any of this this was my recap so no so i'm going to erase all this so if i recorded the last 2.5 video in march of 2020 this is actually a full two years later i'm really tempted to open this door back here i think it'll bring too much light in here which will but i love the idea let's just try this oh shoot oh i can't get it it's jammed to pull do i pull it oh no i have to unlock it it's not jammed it's such a beautiful day does that uh how to never actually record a video oh boy now wait hold on what am i doing now i'm like let me adjust the camera i just love having the the nature scene in the background of course my lighting is all a mess now can you see that um i think i need to turn down it's too bright oh yeah oh my god um wrong way uh should i change the iso what have i done oh no this is so badly backlit now okay hold on i see i see the issue don't worry everybody we're gonna get it back okay it's just some fresh air okay this is a problem i thought i locked the uh i mean if i were in class if i were actually teaching my nature of code class at nyu and i was like oh we have a half an hour left let's go over the mutual attraction example that would be no problem i would be no problem i got that half an hour here we go matcha is gonna kill me i had worked so hard to light this white board and i've completely messed it up let me just take a peek at the chat here uh um i'm just i love how i'm like outside though that's wild um maybe that'll get over i mean maybe it'll sort of turn a little bit more overcast um all right this is just practice anyway where'd i put my marker all right um let me just quickly just see if i can see if the focus is okay um you know i shouldn't put the number i shouldn't put the number let me just write on here you true just write that there let me have a look oh yeah that looks pretty good actually that looks pretty good okay i do i'm a little okay okay okay good enough all right here we go everybody the street has five minutes left but i'm gonna go till 12 30. i've got i'm a little bit hungry this is going to be a little bit of a problem but i think i can tough it out till 12 30. probably will never use this i'm gonna hit uh stop and start recording again i'm just going to turn my mic down a tiny bit even though yeah people are wondering where i am i am in the hudson valley right now in new york state but yes i did grow up in baltimore both go go o's and all right here we go ready everybody uh what have i got in terms of like in the way here that's fine what's uh what are you seeing here can i get this out of the way i guess this is fine i don't love having this stream deck here in the shot i guess i could move desk down a tiny bit yeah that's fine okay better i mean i have to look much more down but okay welcome to another nature of code video this one is all about mutual attraction and the end body problem now i don't know how you arrived here this is a followup to the previous video about gravitational attraction but i'm actually making it almost two years later i just watched the end of that video so i think i know if you're watching this in sequence what you expect okay so that's my opening that is correct uh daniel valdengro okay um this is the example from the end of the last video where every one of these orbiting circles is attracted to that pink circle in the center but this is not anywhere close to a true simulation of how celestial bodies would interact with each other in the wonder valley in the vast wonder that is space this is not at all how actual uh whatever that's fine this is just practice what is the step this is way too exciting i'm way too excited by this like nature scene it's kind of amazing looking forward to the spring when it really gets warm okay so what am i talking about here let's just all right let's review very quickly that formula for gravitational attraction so in the case here we have two bodies i'm going to call them m1 and m2 that's they're the mass of one in the massive two oh no i'm gonna call them body one and body two i'm gonna call them body one and body two they each have a mass that is what is represented by m1 and m2 in this formula we can look at the vector that points from one body to the other we can call that vector r the magnitude of that vector squared is the distance between the two objects squared and then this here is the unit vector to describe the direction of that gravitational force so in my code example this is the pink dot in the center and this is the other circle that is orbiting around that that's being attracted to that pink dot but in the troop needham but if you go back to what i think i mentioned in an earlier video but if you go back to hopefully when i talked about newton's laws and how forces occur in pairs the gravitational force that two exerts on one pulling it towards it one exerts on two pulling it towards this and if we have two bodies if we have two bodies that have no other sorry so if we have two bodies like one and two here and there are no other forces in the environment there's no air resistance there's no other things other bodies the pure essence of just the gravitational forces that these two bodies exert on each other and what motion would occur is known as the twobody problem why did i draw all those stars okay what do i want to say next now one thing i should mention one thing i should mention now one thing i'd like to mention if you were about to go and do some research about the two body problem you would discover that it is a solved problem that the paths of the motion of these bodies can be computed precisely with mathematical equations starting with the formula for gravitational uh attraction and the equations of motion to to execute those solutions requires calculus and here we are in the nature of code creative coding funtime landscape where instead of using um instead of using sort of the instead of using instead of evaluating um instead of evaluating a simulation according to precise mathematical instead of evaluating the scenario through solving differential equations i'm using this technique that i've described previously as euler integration where we just use large time steps the frames of our in the frames of our animation and we add acceleration into the velocity and the velocity into the position shoot i wrote this totally wrong you just do that again if we wanted to investigate some more accurate ways or if we wanted to investigate some more sophisticated methods for doing performing this kind of integration you could we could look at something called leapfrog integration we could look at verlet integration we could look at rungekutta integration and i would love to hear from you if you try to execute a version of whatever i make in this video with one of these styles of integration does that improve or change the results that you get from whatever examples i make here please let me know in the comments but for creating a sort of first pass at the twobody problem then maybe moving to a threebody problem and then to an nbody problem i'm gonna just stick with my simplistic method known as euler integration the other nice thing about what we're doing here is i'm foreshadowing some things that are come later in the nature of code in particular in the autonomous agents chapter because one of the things i want to look at are scenarios like flocking simulations where every agent moving around a system interacts with every other agent that's what we are beginning to do here but with gravitational attraction we will see that we'll quickly run into a kind of computation roadblock because this is a problem that is typically an n squared problem if i have n bodies i need to check everybody's force against every other body that's n squared however there are some optimization techniques that i do have some videos about that you could also consider for when we move from two to three to n for example you might take a look at my videos on the quad tree and a technique designed for end body simulation known as barnes hut but i think i've shown off my outdoor it's not really outdoor i'm like slightly inside this garage whiteboard enough and i could go over and start writing some code to step into at least the two body problem all right so how was that every server thank you bot for your super chat um all right all right so thank you simon when i get to when i get to the three body problem your quote there is super helpful um so how is that so far by the way i'm like hey um love from vancouver thank you i'm like hey this is going okay i'm gonna keep this i'm recording the video right now it's happening and i have 24 minutes to give myself myself give myself at least a half an hour before my next thing today let me just check and make sure there's no like emergency um messages of like um you know uh your children have to break be picked up from school blah blah no no emergency messages i can keep going uh thank you zero one all right um uh uh i'm really worried about my volume is peaking quite a bit i'm turning it down turning it down all right so the first thing that i would like to do to this example i'm going to stick with the array um all right so in looking at this example while if i wanted to do a two body simulation i could reduce it to just two separate variables mover one mover two um i would like to stick with the array because that's going to help me later so what i'm going to do is just change the array to having just two elements in it and i'm also going to get rid of this idea of an attractor right there is no distinction now in this example that i want to make between mover and attractor i mean that's not a real world distinction that's an artificial thing that i created for this idea of attraction simulation attraction simulations and visualizations so now i'm just going to completely get rid of this idea of an attractor i'm also going to take out the reference to the attractor javascript file and by the way i don't know when you're watching this at what time in history and whether p5 is even a thing that exists but i might as well take a moment right now to um update my version of p5 from the last time i recorded these videos which is 1.4.0 okay stop now let me go back and get rid of this attractor and now we have two bodies now they are not exerting any force on each other whatsoever they're just two bodies with an initial random velocity i'm going to take the exact attract function i put in the attractor and move it over into the mover for those of you watching the live stream i'm gonna be done in like five minutes i mean not really but so now the mover has a function by which it can attract another mover just sorry i'm reading the chat for a second okay um and let me actually i'm actually going to delete the attractor.js file just to keep things clean so because i now because i have an array uh oh no now because i have only two mover objects i can write the explicit functions for mover one to attract two and mover two to attract one of course they're actually zero and one and one in zero because i'm using an array and arrays the index values start at zero so this whoops oh it's movers apologies so this is now mover zero attracting mover one and you kind of saw that so i think what i'd like to do is just give them very little um starting velocity and we can see every time i run this mover one is attracted to mover zero of course i'm not actually drawing their index values maybe i can overlay that here just so you can see now i have mover one attracting mover zero and you can see this little dance that they do with each other okay i'm just sort of thinking about where i'm going with this once again we might produce some results that we once again maybe we would reveal something more about this if we just like before if i draw these circles with trails i might be able to i'm trying to say here oh focus on me i really want to answer that question but uh i can't it's going to break my rhythm too much it's a really good question i would say no you don't need to switch but yes and that's what i'm gonna do ellis as well so just to try to understand and see what's going on a bit more let's add back some trails and let's see if we can give these circles more precise locations uh and with specific initial velocities to see if there's any kind of more expected patterns that we might see so now i have the mover start um on opposite horizontal ends of the canvas let's see what happens if i start one mover maybe moving directly up and the other ones start moving directly down so i'm going to add two additional arguments to the constructor which gives me the x and y components of the velocity vector well i love this they're moving quite slowly so a couple things i could do is let's give them a higher initial velocity and let's increase the strength of the gravitational force and we get this nice beautiful like sort of like repeating circular dance now again i am not using now again i'm not solving for the precise equations of motion i am not using the proper units of measurement that we might have in uh outer space or i'm not using the proper units of measurement that map to actual celestial bodies in terms of their distance and mass the universal gravitational constant but i do see this makes a lot of sense in terms of what we are seeing here oh i'm excited by this i almost don't want to keep going because i want to stop here and just like play with the parameters and variables of the system add infinitem but let's add a third but let's add a third body let me see what simon says oh yeah um now i mentioned that the two body problem is a solved problem the threebody problem is not a solved one we could approximate the actual motion we could approximate we could approximate the motion of three bodies using sophisticated methods of integration let's see how close we get just with my examples right here i'm going to add a second a third body just in the center and i'm going to give it no velocity just for the moment so and it's not it's not participating in this at all now what i need to do is i need to say okay zero attracts one zero attracts two one attract zero and two and two attracts one and two one zero and one amazingly the body in the center is not moving because its attraction forces are perfectly balanced between those two particles on the outside that's kind of unbelievable that's really cool i'm not i don't know what initial velocity to give it let's just push it slightly to the left one thing that i might suggest just to play with different sort of visual ideas is drawing a line between all of them instead of drawing the actual particles themselves and all well actually let me not mention that right now i so this is not sustainable right if i want to start having like more four four so this is not super sustainable if i want to have four movers five movers i can't keep individually assigning which ones attract the other ones so but i can write a loop that handles this now i have a loop down here to update and show all the different movers i want to keep the force calculations in a separate loop but i need a nested one this loop now it's not behaving the same way and i'll get to why in a second but this nested loop is doing exactly what this says start with mover zero and have it attract one and two then go to mover one have it retract zero two then two zero and one but there is a bit of a problem because every mover attracting every other mover means that the mover will also attract itself because it is another mover in the array so one way that i could approach this is by just saying as long as mover is not equal to other and this is checking if two objects you can check if they're equal meaning they're the same data in memory of the computer that's the same object then this should now be exactly what i had before only it's not because i have it twice so i could delete this now and we should now be seeing exactly the pattern of motion of these there's probably a lot of things you could try doing in terms of how you visualize this one idea would be to connect them with lines so i'm no longer drawing the dots only the lines this doesn't look like much yet but i have a feeling once the three start to move a bit more chaotically in relation to each other we'll see what we get here i'm curious just what happens if i um let's if i do four movers and kind of put them in a like a bit of a diamond pattern and i don't know what i expected to get but i'm quite pleased with these interesting results and i think there's a lot for you to sort of try and continue playing with just out of curiosity let me go back to making them random so we can see with them random i'm getting quite an unstable chaotic system i i'm actually quite surprised how much it's staying within the canvas in my experience with doing this it's usually just going to kind of go crazy and fly off the handle but you can see but i think what i'm trying to emphasize here is that by thinking about the initial starting conditions of the system the results that you get might have some symmetry or sort of character to them that you could really um that you could take advantage of for a particular kind of design and there it's off and running um okay so let me think about though how could i achieve something like what i started with but not have to individually assign all of the locations oh i want to use polar coordinates here but um that's not something that um i could i could give them random locations though okay that's what i'm gonna do um well one way to do that would be to give all the x y locations as randomly around the perimeter of a circle if you remember in my first videos about picking random vectors i did something exactly like that let's have the mass be consistent between them all just for right now and i'm going to have a position so basically i'm picking a random vector i'm stretching it out by a hundred and then i'm adding the center of the canvas so that it's um so that its location is relative to that i'm going to take out the line for a second and just show the dots add the position let's not i don't let's not update the locations for a second all right so that's not very many of them right i should have like arranged them spaced out perfectly around the circle but let's do 50 of them so what happens if i arrange all the particles uh this way and what if their velocity hmm well let's just see what happens with a random velocity right it's kind of going out of control let's reduce the mass by quite a bit chaos ensues i don't know if i really like this result oh and it's almost 12 30 but i'm kind of getting to the end of this um okay i have a different idea let's arrange them all in a vertical line um so let's have x be in the center let's arrange them from top to the middle um and let's have their velocities all point in the same direction and i would like the ones that as they get closer to the center to have a higher mass this did not work at all i might have to come back and finish this all right hold on let's let's not update them oh yeah this is what i was trying to do oh i forgot to turn the boiler off hold on let me uh uh yeah um well there's interesting stuff happening in the chat but i will address that in a second i times four yes that's what i want to do um okay i times uh let's see that's fine let's oh i made that so high let's put that let's make this a global vari i'm going to make g a global variable because hold on i'm going to make g a global variable so i can fine tune it a bit more easily it's really just one variable to like increase the overall strength or weakness of the gravitational attraction forces let's make that one i'll make the initial velocity just one oh you know what they should be faster at the top maybe map from i goes from 0 to 50 so they're going at a fast rate to the left there oh i could alternate uh hold on there's so many things i could do with the initial conditions i'm getting kind of obsessed with this uh down to uh zero okay let's just very let's put an update back yeah i was sort of hoping for something more like this it's kind of spinning out of control i want that bottom particle i could also like to be locked in a bit more uh maybe i just don't want so many of them goodbye oh let's have them alternate their directions this is a nice little bit of code using modulo to have every other one go the other direction there we go i was looking for something more like this and let's have it go the whole way down let's increase the strength of gravity a little bit um i'm just going to make them i'm going to make the mass of all them equal and maybe a little bit bigger too big put g back to one okay you can see how you could do this forever let's draw the lines one more time without the circles that's a great suggestion though i could also put you know i already have some artificial limits in the system like if i go here under mover oh sorry where is that if i i already have some artificial limits in the system if i go look at the attract function you'll remember that i used constrain to keep the range of the forces within some reasonable minimum and maximum range i could also do something where i say this dot velocity limit and limit the velocity of some maximum speed which might stabilize the system a bit more not in a necessarily realistic way but in a way that might allow me to sort of explore the kinds of patterns i could make what does this look like without the trails what does this look like with many many many more particles or mover what does it look like with many many more movers whoops oh because my mapping so i need a variable because whenever i'm mapping i whoa ah look at this wait why is it oh what is going on ah the system is collapsing under itself these are the movers we're adding the shakers yeah too powerful let's make it more powerful oh yeah less powerful oh it's stretching out okay so i i've gone off the rails with this a bit i'm way off the train track if you will so i hope that you're getting some ideas here um i'm trying to think of how i want to end this i kind of wanted to have them swirling around themselves so the circle was actually kind of better but um whoa i can't stop as my problem uh i'm trying to think like is there like an interesting place to end this i might have to come back and redo the end like play around with this more and like come to some sort of interesting conclusion when i added the speed limiter yeah that's it that's where it started collapsing that's a good point um add a force along radius of orbit to each other do colors yeah i mean the reason why i wasn't doing polar coordinates later is is because i um that's like chapter three and i didn't want to like introduce that here um maybe i'll mention that i gotta wrap this up though so i can't stop playing with this i have a um i have a feeling if you think about the initial conditions you know one thing i avoided you doing here was using polar coordinates because that's actually something that's part of chapter three so you might look ahead at that video then you could arrange all these movers in along uh then you could arrange all these movers in maybe starting a spiral pattern and some type of circular pattern i'll try to show you some examples of how that might look but really if you add color if you think about different shapes the number of movers there's a lot of possibilities here i should mention that once you start to increase this total for example if i put this total at 500 um the f i'm not even getting the first frame because the amount of drawing is way too extensive let me see if i can hit stop here i haven't crashed everything too horribly come on stop i want to stop recording and start recording again um come on i hope i saved this i can always recreate it stop don't go to auto refresh 500 was way too much oh wait there we go i stopped it come on come back to me browser come back to me browser so that was so extreme i think also drawing uh 500 times 500 lines was crazy um wait wait i think it's going to come back um there we go i got it back no what i wanted to emphasize was how just doing the force calculations of 500 particles against all other 500 is rather extreme no wait wait it's gonna come back all right i'm now i'm now i'm no longer i can't be patient anymore i'm refreshing hold on let's just find out like oh good no no no no we're in bad shape here no no where did i last save it i can't tell if this is what i yeah no this is what i last saved it as right so we're okay let's make this back five let me just see oh yeah we're good we're good we're good also i got it back but even without drawing the lines and just drawing them as dots let me put it at 100 to be a bit more reasonable like this works of course they all collapse under each other because my initial conditions aren't that interesting let me put it at 500 now this is running slow not just because of the drawing because if i comment out the forces you can see that the frame rate is fine what is incredibly slow about this is the n is the n squared i is the uh is the is the order is the efficiency what's incredibly slow about this is the n squared efficiency of the algorithm where every single mover needs to apply a force to every other mover 100 times 100 that's 10 000 computations but if we were to optimize this using a quad tree and the sort of barnes hut algorithm which i'll provide links in the description with references for that including my quad tree video we could reduce the complexity there enormously to be able to make this run fairly smoothly um and i think i'm wrapping this up now um i'm just gonna i also want to reference this wonderful paper classification of symmetry groups for planar and body choreographies what this paper shows is that with certain initial starting conditions these beautiful symmetrical orbits these the dance of end bodies if you will that result in these um what this paper shows is that with certain initial conditions for various end body systems these beautiful symmetrical dances occur and there's a wonderful um simulation of the of and there's a wonderful simulation of many of these patterns created by dan greece for that particular paper now i'll note that these simulations are mapping the ex that these simulations are running i'll note that these simulations are running through the trajectories based on um let's i don't know how to say this i'll note that these i'll note that these simulations are running through the trajectories based on the mathematical equations and not running through an actual physics simulation but i've you know it's an amazing sort of stretch goal here maybe i could do this someday maybe you're going to be inspired to try this is could you look through this paper find some of these initial conditions and see how closely you can match different kinds of these um beautiful um dances let's try six on a square oh i've got to try these i have a whole project now to work on i don't maybe this will come back in another video sometime all right so this wraps up chapter two of the nature of code uh you can move right on into chapter three a lot of the aspects of chapter three in terms of looking at angles and rotations and orbital motion could really be applied to this particular visualization if you make something from this video check the link in the video description it'll take you to a website where you can add a version of it and i would love to see it thanks for watching and i'll see you sometime soon on the coding train goodbye okay um um um yes i said don't worry chad i'll be done in five minutes an hour ago okay i have to go i have a meeting in 15 minutes 15 minutes to walk the dog eat lunch thank you all for tuning in i wish i could stay and like answer some questions oh i got to spin the wheel i got to spin the wheel hold on hold on you can't not have that maybe i need to do a separate twitch stream since i've been doing that on twitch um remind me later my goodness uh oh boy please no please history have the randomizer in it let's see show full history um local ah why why oh wait i did it this yeah uh no no no yeah but i want the specific page i went to oh it's there beautiful just wanted to show you okay so i could remove the end body problem i could remove the ulam spiral and in theory now i'm about to spin this wheel to pick the next thing i'm going to do let's see what on here do i really not want to do oh and i wanted to add the kerningsburg bridge but i guess i'll have to add this i'm going to remind me that another time can i add that easily not right now i don't have a system for adding something um all right geez i don't know what i want to come up here all right here we go i can't look oh it's totally gonna land on the slide puzzle solver why does it always land on the slide puzzle oh it's going to falling sand is it going to hit mandle bulb oh mandelball will be exciting keep going come on mandelbaum okay that's awesome oh my god the mantle bulb is really hard i don't have to just do it as a point cloud i hope everybody will allow me to just do the mandelbulb just as a point cloud but that'll be the next coding challenge i don't know what i'm going to record that because um i might not be able to stream next friday but we'll see all right everybody i gotta go i'm gonna play this play you out thank you um just a quick uh thank you for uh brilliant for sponsoring today's live stream and i'm going to go to this uh goodbye music and uh just sort of race on out of here i'll take a peek at the chat if anybody has any really important things i want to mention or ask about but i will see you all soon as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this dot this dot song never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go autotune and the internet will fix that for me coordinate song it's the polar cartesian coordinate song it's the polar cartesian coordinate song you
